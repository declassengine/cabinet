: This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.CP. 308 (26).MEMORANDUM FOR THE CABINET.The Present Position in regard to the China Customs Tariff Conferenceat Peking.THE Tariff Conference met on the 26th October last year and the last meeting at which any Chinese delegates were present was held early in April this year. During that period the work of the Conference was carried on with great difficulty, inter-mittently and spasmodically, owing to the constant civil wars and political upheavals in China.The general scheme on which the Conference was working was the framing of a Treaty by which the Powers were to grant to China immediately the surtaxes promised in the Washington Customs Treaty of 19^2 (known as the Washington surtaxes : 2\ per cent, on ordinary goods and 5 per cent, on luxuries), were to recognise her right to enjoy tariff autonomy on. and as from, the 1st January, 192*9, and, in the interim period prior to the coming into force of tariff autonomy, were to grant China a higher scale of surtaxes   ranging up to per   cent,  (known as the   interim   surtaxes) on allcommodities. In return for these favours, China was to take steps towards the total abolition of the pernicious system of taxation of trade in transit known as li-kin. and was to agree to devote a proportion of the new revenues to the liquidation of the unsecured debt in accordance with a debt consolidation scheme acceptable to her creditors.The schedules of the Washington surtaxes and the interim surtaxes have, with much expert labour, been prepared and generally accepted, while in the early stages of the Conference a resolution was passed which is generally accepted as meaning that the Powers have promised that China shall have tariff autonomy on the 1st January, 1929. Apart from this, no progress whatever has been made with the Conference scheme. The principal controversy has raged round the question of debt consolidation which- comprised a multitude of extremely difficult and complex problems, as, for instance, what proportion of the revenues should be ear-marked for debts, how these revenues were to be preserved intact, whether foreign control over China&apos;s customs revenues should be imposed for that purpose, what debts should be included in the consolidation scheme, how the total of such debts should be arrived at, the nature of the consolidation bond, rates of interest and amortisation, and, lastly, whether the debt consolidation scheme should be imposed upon China as part of an international instrument engaging the responsibility of all the Powers, such as, for instance, the Boxer Protocol of 1901, or whether China should produce and put into effect her own scheme.On not one of these questions were the Delegations able to arrive at an agreement, and several of them have never yet been discussed with the Chinese Delegation.In April, the Nationalist armies (Kuominchun) were driven out of Peking by the allied forces of Chang Tso-lin and Wu Pei-fu, the Central Government disappeared, and the Chinese Delegation ceased, to exist. The foreign Delegations continued the discussions among themselves in the absence of a Chinese Delegation, mainly with the object of agreeing upon the terms of a resolution authorising the levy of the Washington surtaxes. It was generally felt that the promises made at Washington five years ago should be implemented before any formal suspension of the Conference. The foreign delegates, however, again entirely failed to reach an agreement as to the purposes to-which the proceeds of the Washington surtaxes should be devoted, , and their discussions have now been suspended without achieving any result.The present position, therefore, is that the Tariff Conference, having accomplished nothing except to give to China a claim to tariff autonomy in 1 929, which will probably have to be conceded, is now completely in abeyance, and cannot in any case meet again until the end of the hot weather, namely, about the middle of September at the 3561 [14897]
earliest. It can only meet then if there is a Chinese Government and a Chinese Delegation to negotiate with ; but if the conditions are such as to permit of it meeting at all we feel that it would be mistaken policy for us to refuse to participate in its discussions. Our main object is to act justly towards the Chinese, meet their legitimate aspirations as far as it lies in our power to do so in spite of the many shortcomings on their side, and restore our relations with them to a basis of mutual friendship and goodwill so as to facilitate the removal of the obstacles now impeding the normal course of our trade in the South and its expansion elsewhere. Apart from the essential wisdom and justice of such an attitude, its adoption is the more essential as it cannot be contemplated that His Majesty&apos;s Government will in future be prepared to resort to the xise of force for the purpose of maintaining her Treaty rights in China. Our first step must be to implement the Washington promises, and we are now endeavouring in anticipation of the reopening of the Conference to find some certain means of granting these surtaxes which the other Powers, following our lead, will find themselves unable to reject. We feel that it is of the highest importance that we should keep faith by implementing these promises, now five years overdue, at the earliest possible moment and that we should give a decided lead to the other Powers in this matter. Having thus clearly shown our goodwill towards China, it will be possible for us to watch the result, see what is the effect of the grant of these surtaxes and then possibly proceed with negotiations with the object of granting further increases of revenue, removing obstacles to our trade and remedying some of the chief causes of friction between the two countries.Co-operation with the other foreign Powers having proved a matter of such difficulty as to produce a complete deadlock at the Tariff Conference, we are now considering the possibility of adopting a new course of action tending to bring us into closer sympathy with Chinese aims and aspirations.If a policy based on these principles can be practically evolved, it woidd mean that we should aim at making our own terms with China irrespective of the other Powers.This, of course, means that we shall have to formulate our proposals on the whole subject of Treaty revision.   Treaty revision may be summed up as comprising: 1. Extra-territonality. 2. Tariff matters.As regards 1, we must await the Extra-territoriality Commission^ report. All that can be said at present is that we should remedy every abuse, make every concession that can be reasonably made without affecting our vital interests.As regards tariff matters, our policy should be based on the following principles : 1. Get what we can towards abolition of li-hin without attempting to make it acondition sine qud non. 2. Grant the Washington surtaxes unconditionally and get such assurances aswe can.3. Accept the interim surtaxes. .4. Grant tariff autonomy against a conventional tariff for a number of years on the basis of interim surtaxes.5. All surplus revenues, after retaining the amount required for present loan and indemnity services, to be disposed of as directed by the Chinese themselves without foreign intervention between Central and Provincial Governments.6. No custodianship for surplus revenues.7. No debt consolidation to be imposed upon the Chinese.On this basis we should put ourselves straight with China and free ourselves from the poisonous influences which are drawing us further and further into the quagmire of the internal affairs of China.Two memoranda, giving a more detailed account of British policy towards China, and of the questions which came before the Tariff Conference, are annexed hereto.Foreign Office, July 30, 1926.V. W.
[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. ][ -Annex I.MEMORANDUM ON BRITISH POLICY IN CHINA.THE memorandum on British Policy in China of the 9th February, 1926 (Confidential 12907) ,* after a brief historical survey, describes how the Foreign Office put forward the suggestion that the former policy of supporting Peking against the provinces should be abandoned, and that this should be effected by abandoning the system of foreign control over Chinese customs revenue which was initiated by the Custodian Bank Agreement of 1912. It was feared that, if this system were perpetuated and applied to the much larger revenues about to accrue under the Washington surtaxes, interim surtaxes, and, finally, tariff autonomy, it would antagonise the provinces to such a degree as to endanger the Maritime Customs Administration a matter of vital importance to foreign trade and thus also eventually endanger the service of the loans and Boxer indemnity secured on the present customs revenues.The first proposal made by the Foreign Office was that the Commissioner of. Customs should continue to collect the customs revenues as at present, but that he should retain and remit to Shanghai only a proportion sufficient for the service of the secured foreign obligations. He was to hand over the balance locally to the Chinese Superintendent of Customs, who, reverting pro tanto to the pre-1912 position, would be responsible to the Central Government for the disposition of the revenues. The arguments in favour of this policy and the objections of the delegation to its adoption are set out on pages 15 to the end of the memorandum above referred to. As the differences of opinion still persisted, the Foreign Office summed up the whole position and set forth the main arguments on both sides in a long telegram, of which the following is a summary : ^1. The delegation propose to eliminate control once the revenue has been lodged in foreign and custodian banks in Shanghai.The Foreign Office reply that this does not dispose of the difficulty that control begins at the point where the revenue is collected, which is also the point where interference may be apprehended.2. The delegation believe that the Foreign Office fears as to danger to the Customs Administration are exaggerated, and that there is no objection in the provinces to the use of customs revenues for debt consolidation or to the maintenance of control over customs revenue for this purpose.The Foreign Office reply that it is common ground that Canton will not permit surtaxes to be used for this purpose. How is Canton to be treated exceptionally, and what reason is there for believing that Canton&apos;s attitude would not be copied in other centres %3. The delegation object to leaving customs revenues in the hands of local officials :-(a.) Because it will lead to local civil wars.The Foreign Office agree that this is possible, but consider this is a lesser evil than nation-wide civil war.(6.) Destroy the Customs Administration and promote disintegration.The Foreign Office reply that disintegration is inevitable and that the Customs Administration must adapt itself to the new order. They agree that decentralisation-tion must involve the Customs Administration in dangers and difficulties, but that these can be met and overcome.(c.) Dissolve the structure of Chinese centralisation of finance.The Foreign Office reply that centralisation of finance is largely due to foreign pressure and is possibly responsible for the revolt against the Manchus and the growing disintegration under the republic. If the Chinese wish their finances to be3561b    [14897a]Annex 2.b
centralised, the only healthy course is for them to surrender the revenues require:! for the purpose voluntarily.4. The delegation wish to extend foreign control over the new revenues and suggest that force may be ued to keep them intact.The Foreign Office reply that instead of increasing our commitments and extending international interference in Chinese affairs, we should seek to preserve only what is essential. In particular, it is no longer possible to use force to save customs revenues, a was done in Canton in the years 1918 to 1924.5. The British delegation have made certain proposals with regard to debt consolidation.The Foreign Office fear that however favourable these proposals may be, the Chinese, who, it now appears, claim that debt consolidation must be dealt with outside the conference, may reject them, and that, in that case, the conference would break down, leaving us on the side of the Powers forcing control upon China.The delegation, however, still maintained their previous objections and met the Foreign Office argument by stating that all their proposals were subject to the final reservation that before coming to any decision, they must be satisfied that the proposed arrangements were acceptable to the provinces. With a view to meeting the objections raised by the delegation, the Foreign Office, therefore, modified their previous proposals, and now suggested that no change should be made in the system of collection and custody of the existing customs revenues, but that the new policy of non-interference should be applied to the new revenues only, that is to say, that the proceeds of the surtaxes should be handed over locally by the Commissioner of Customs to the Chinese Superintendent. The following quotation from the Foreign Office telegram explains very clearly the new proposal: &quot; The levy of surtaxes to be remitted to Shanghai will be immediately challenged by Canton, but His Majesty&apos;s Government desire at all costs to avoid provoking a customs crisis at Canton. In the first place, a seizure of revenue unresisted by the Powers would place the commissioner in a position of great difficulty, and might involve the Customs Administration itself. The seizure might not be confined to the surtax, but might extend to the whole revenue and might be copied in other ports and so endanger even the pre-Boxer loans. In the second place, such a crisis would exacerbate an already deplorable situation, and would make it impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to make the friendly concession to Canton which I have in mind, namely, an offer of a share of the customs revenues. Such an offer cannot be made by His Majesty&apos;s Government acting alone, and it cannot be made only to Canton. It can only be made by adopting my plan, namely, stipulating that proceeds of surtaxes at all ports be handed to the local superintendent of customs.&quot;The delegation still held, however, that even these modified proposals were impracticable, and were supported in this view by the Inspector-General of Customs. Sir Francis Aglen did not dispute the possibility of Canton&apos;s repudiating the Conference Treaty and laying hands on the increased revenues, but he concurred in the view that all that the delegation could do was to satisfy themselves as far as possible, before any treaty was concluded, that the decision of the conference would be accepted by Canton and by the other main provincial groups. He supported the delegation view that the present Canton situation was in no way related to the customs surplus question, and that it could not be remedied by anything that might be done at the Tariff Conference.The Foreign Office accordingly somewhat reluctantly consented to the delegation proceeding with their own scheme. But just at this moment the wider schemes of the conference were shelved by the action of the Chinese delegation in tabling a resolution calling for the immediate grant of the Washington surtaxes, in consequence of which all discussions henceforth centre round the Washington surtaxes.As the levy of these surtaxes could be authorised by resolution of the conference without further reference to the home Governments, it seemed that our delegation would have no opportunity of satisfying themselves beforehand whether Canton would consent to the proceeds of the surtaxes being remitted away from Kwantung. Sir R. Macleay was, therefore, asked to obtain the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s consul-general at Canton on certain points. The questions, and Sir J. Jamieson&apos;s answer, are as follows :  
Question.1. If the levy of the 2g per cent, and 5 per cent, surtaxes commences within the next few months, is Canton likely to lay claim to the proceeds ?2. In view of the fact that such a &apos; claim would  not now he repelled by show of force, would the local Govern-ment be likely to seize these revenues ?3. What form would such seizure take?4. If matters wrent so far, might seizure (a) extend to whole revenue; (b) imperil the administration and authority of the commissioner ?5. If a proposal emanating from us to pay over the proceeds of the surtaxes direct to the local administration were made, could such a proposal be carried into effect ?6. If carried into effect, would it (a) increase or diminish the danger to(i) the   remainder  of   the  revenues;(ii) the customs administration ? (b) have any effect on the boycott situation ?7. What exact significance do the Cantonese attach to the phrase &quot; cus-toms autonomy &quot; which appears in the economic programme of the Kuomin-tang ?Answer.Yes, on the ground that the present tariff furnishes ample security for the service of foreign loans, and that the Canton Government are entitled to the balance after the payment of a propor-tion as a contribution to such service.Seizure is unlikely, seeing that as yet the Canton Government have not any efficient oiganisation capable of collecting the revenue themselves. This answer should be read in conjunction with answer to No. 7.Yes. I would, in fact, favour its being done.(a.) It would decrease the danger. (b.) None at all.Complete liberty to levy any duties they please without foreign intervention, and if Communists gain the upper hand attempts in this direction will probably be made.It will be seen from this that Sir J. Jamieson was of opinion that Canton would claim, but would not seize the customs surtax revenues, and that the proposal emanating from us to pay over the proceeds of the surtaxes direct to the local administration would have no effect on the boycott situation, but would diminish the danger to the remainder of the revenues and to the Customs Administration. He considered that the proposal could be carried into effect, and was in favour of its being done.The delegation, however, did not share this view. They doubted whether Canton would claim the surtaxes, and thought that they would be satisfied with the share of the revenues accruing to them under the li-kin compensation scheme. They strongly deprecated our taking the initiative in proposing the surrender of the Washington surtaxes to Canton, and considered that we ought in any case to wait for them to claim them.Meanwhile, the Chinese delegation^ resolution in regard to the immediate levy of the Washington surtaxes had been under discussion during the whole of March, but after six meetings the conference failed to agree on &quot; conditions and purposes.&quot; Dr. Yen proposed that the proceeds should be accumulated by the Maritime Customs Administration, and applied one-third to liquidation of debts, one-third to abolition of li-kin, and one-third to administrative expenses, but this proposal was rejected. At this point the Kuo Min-chun was driven out of Peking, the Chinese delegation melted away, and the conference went into abeyance.The question then arose how to grant the Washington surtaxes before any formal suspension of the conference. The Foreign Office feared that any further attempt to agree upon conditions and purposes would only lead to indefinite delay and perhaps make it impossible ever to implement the promises made at Washington. They therefore pressed upon the delegation the view that we should accept the assurances already given by Dr. Yen and forthwith authorise the levy of the surtaxes without any further attempt to impose conditions. If this were done, the surtax revenue would not be subject to the Custodian Bank Agreement of 1912, so that the foreign Powers and the Customs Administration would not be concerned in any [14897a] b 2
difference on the subject of surtax proceeds that might arise between the Central Government and Canton.The Governor of Hong Kong also now expressed his agreement with the views of the Foreign Office and His Majesty&apos;s consul-general at Canton that a good effect would be produced locally if we took the initiative in offering the proceeds of the surtaxes to Canton. Sir R. Macleay, however, maintained his previous view, and in particular objected to the unconditional grant of the Washington surtaxes, as that would, in his opinion, involve the similar unconditional grant later of interim surtaxes and tariff autonomy, and would make it impossible to carry into effect the scheme on which the conference had been working. He therefore proceeded to discuss with his foreign colleagues, in the absence of the Chinese delegation, the terms upon which the surtaxes should be granted.On the 15th May, the foreign delegations, in the absence of the Chinese delegation, agreed among themselves on a draft of the resolution authorising the levy of the Washington surtaxes. This draft was to be used as a basis of discussion with the Chinese delegation when re-constituted. The proceeds of the surtaxes were to be applied as follows :  1. Coast trade duties were to be abolished and proceeds of transit pass fees allocated to the provinces; these reforms would reduce present Customs revenues by 9 million dollars a year, which would be made up by the transfer of a like sum from surtax revenue.2. The Customs Administration was to remit to the Ministry of Finance 750,000 dollars-a month (amounting to 9 million dollars a year).3. The balance of the proceeds of the surtaxes, about 17 million dollars, was to be accumulated by the Maritime Customs Administration and applied, in accordance with the terms of the treaty to be concluded at the conference, in liquidation of China&apos;s unsecured and inadequately secured debts; if no treaty has been concluded in two years&apos; time then in accordance with principles then to be agreed upon.Draft agreements were also drawn up and accepted (a) revising the Custodian Bank Agreement of 1912, (b) arranging for custody of the Washington surtax revenues.The foreign delegates met on the 11th June to place upon record the approval of their Governments to the Washington Surtax Agreement, and the Foreign Office then learnt that the Inspector-General was very apprehensive that collection of the surtaxes under the draft agreement would put too great a strain on the customs and precipitate a crisis, first at Canton and then at other centres. Acting on his advice, the delegates agreed that the Chinese Government should be notified at the time of signature that it was assumed that they will have made all arrangements with the provincial authorities for giving due effect to the agreement, but that, in the event of opposition arising, collection of the surtaxes would be postponed until the difficulties had been overcome. A few days later we learnt that the Inspector-General was. very pessimistic as to the outlook. He had recently defined his future policy in a letter to the Canton Commissioner in the following sense : The best course to follow7 would be to withhold all tariff increases at present; but the Powers, assuming that the customs could be used as an instrument to carry out any paper agreement, appear to be insisting on proceeding with their Washington surtax proposals, which must break down completely on account of provincial opposition led by Canton, unless they intend to back their agreement by force, or the Chinese Government first arrange matters with the provinces. As he gauged the situation, neither will be clone, and, if faced with the consequences he anticipates, he therefore intends, in order to preserve his administration as a revenue-collecting machine, to yield to provincial demands and hand over the surtax proceeds to the local authorities regardless of the provisions of any agreement come to between the Powers and the Chinese Government. He regards such a movement as deplorable from the point of view of British and foreign interests and prestige, involving as it would the burdening of trade with increased duties to no other purpose than to filling the pockets of warring militarists already milking the country dry, but as the only solution from the point of view of the preservation of his administration, unless the Powers will afford him their active support.This seemed to indicate that the Foreign Office had been right in their view that if the present system of collection, control and custody of Chinese customs revenues were perpetuated and applied to the new revenues about to be collected,
it might endanger the Maritime Customs Administration, and that the only way of averting this danger was to cause the Commissioner of Customs to surrender the surtax revenues locally to the Chinese Superintendent of Customs.The next development was that the Japanese Government, for reasons which are still obscure, sent special instructions to their delegation to insist on amendments to the draft Washington Surtax Agreement, which would have the effect of eliminating everything relating to transit passes and coast trade duties (which are of the nature of li-kin), increasing the proportion impounded for unsecured debts from one-half to one-third, and providing for the suspension of the agreement, even after the levy had commenced, should provincial opposition develop. This demarche, which seemed to be aimed specially at us, was preceded by a press campaign in Japan, suggesting that Great Britain was responsible for the breakdown of the conference. In consequence of this, Sir R. Macleay asked the senior Minister to call a meeting of delegates, at which he made the following statement : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government regret that in recent informal discussions which have taken place between foreign delegations in the absence of the Chinese, in anticipation of an early resumption of conference and of a renewal of the request by the Chinese delegates for the immediate grant of the Washington surtaxes, it has not been found possible to reach complete agree-ment on proposals to form a basis of discussion with the Chinese.&quot; In these circumstances His M&amp;jesty&apos;s Government are of the opinion that no useful purpose will be served by the foreign delegates continuing these informal negotiations with a view to reaching a closer degree of agreement at the present stage, and that it would be preferable to await the resumption of conference and the formulation of Chinese proposals.&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government further instruct me to state that it is their earnest desire and intention to. implement Washington Treaty with the least possible delay, and to grant the surtaxes provided for therein, if this should be the wish of Chinese Government, and that they are prepared to discuss any reasonable proposals put forward by Chinese delegation to this end which are in harmony with the spirit and letter of the Washington Treaty.&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government also wish it to be clearly understood that in the event of the Chinese delegation, on the resumption of the conference, tabling a proposal for the immediate enforcement of Washington surtaxes, they have no intention, after agreement on such proposal has been reached, to suspend proceedings of conference or to break off negotiations for the conclusion of a tariff treaty, which have been interrupted by recent political developments in China.&quot;    &apos; .&apos;The present position, therefore, is that all discussions, even among the foreign delegations, are in abeyance, and will not be resumed until the Chinese Government have appointed a delegation with whom it is possible to negotiate. In any case, in view of the hot weather, it is hardly likely that the conference will be resumed before September at the earliest. The immediate problem that will have to be decided before then is the question of our policy in regard to the Washington surtaxes. The twe alternatives are : [a.) The delegation policy, which still consists in extending the present system of collection, control and custody of the new surtax revenues on the lines of the draft agreements for the levy of the Washington surtaxes and &quot; custody of revenues referred to above. (&amp;.) The Foreign Office policy, which is that we should adopt the line that we are willing to accept the assurances similar to those already given by Dr. Yen and grant the Washington surtaxes forthwith without imposing conditions and without any stipulations as to impounding the revenue.The effect of this would be that the surtax revenue would not be subject to the Custodian Bank Agreement of 1912, under which the present revenues are remitted by the Commissioner of Customs at each port to two foreign custodian banks in Shanghai. The Chinese Government would have to issue their own instructions as to how the new revenue was to be dealt with. Presumably they would order it to be remitted to Shanghai; then, if Canton objected and claimed the proceeds of the surtaxes for themselves, the Powers could stand aside and leave Canton and Peking to settle their own differences.The Customs Administration could also stand aside, for the Inspector-General could instruct the Commissioner of Customs at Canton to yield to force majeure and
hand over the surtax revenue to the local administration while continuing to deal with the old revenues in accordance with the Custodian Bank Agreement of 1912.The advantage of adopting this policy is, in the view of the Foreign Office, that the Powers would not be involved in the domestic quarrels of the Chinese, there would be no danger of attacks upon the Customs Administration, there would in all probability be no disposition anywhere to seize the existing Customs revenues (the proceeds of the 5 per cent, flat rate which are subject to the Custodian Bank Agreement of 1912), and the Inspector-General, in surrendering the surtax revenue locally, would not be forced into the invidious and dangerous position of acting in defiance of an international agreement.If provincial opposition to the grant of these revenues to Peking should develop; if, for example, Canton were to seize the surtax revenue, thus making it impossible for the Central Government to carry out its assurances, we shall doubt-less be charged with having given away the Washington surtaxes and got nothing in return. There is, however, a growing consensus of weighty opinion that the Washington surtaxes, being so long overdue;, should be granted to China without conditions. In view of this fact and. of the supreme importance of averting the dangers which now clearly threaten the Customs Administration, the Foreign Office incline to the view that to give away the Washington surtaxes for nothing, if it is an evil at all, is the lesser of two evils and one which we can afford to face with equanimity.With regard to the treaty granting interim surtaxes and tariff autonomy, negotiations for which will be resumed after the grant of the Washington surtaxes, the position which the Foreign Office desires to take up is that we expect the Chinese to bring forward a debt consolidation scheme reasonably acceptable to her creditors in return for which we would agree to grant her interim surtaxes. Now, if, in the meanwhile, the provinces have accepted the arrangement regarding Washington surtaxes and enabled the Central Government to keep her promise to devote one-third of the proceeds to liquidation of debt and one-third to abolition of li-kin, then it is obvious that we need not feel any further anxiety about provincial concurrence. We can accept the debt consolidation scheme, grant the interim surtaxes, and feel reasonably sure that the whole arrangement will be smoothly carried into effect. If, on the other hand, the provinces have rebelled and seized the surtax revenue, and thus made it impossible for the Central Government to carry out their promises in regard to the Washington surtaxes, we can then quite safely insist upon provincial concurrence before we grant the interim surtaxes. As Sir R. Macleay has pointed out, the Washington surtaxes will provide a good test of the attitude of the provinces towards the interim surtaxes. This line would also be a reasonable combination of the views of the Foreign Office and the British delegation. If the British delegation would accept the Foreign Office view as to granting the Washington surtaxes without conditions, the Foreign Office could accept their view that, if necessary, conditions and provincial concurrence must be insisted upon for the interim surtaxes. That is to say, if, owing to provincial opposition or any other reason, the arrangement with regard to Washington surtaxes has broken down, we could adopt in toto the delegation^ policy, for the Powers would, in such an event, be fully justified in refusing to sign or ratify the treaty without first receiving adequate guarantees that it would be carried out.One final point is this : The Washington surtaxes will only be levied in the short period before the interim surtaxes come into force. They then cease, and are swallowed up in the interim surtaxes. Therefore, if it is found that we have given away the Washington surtaxes for nothing, it may only be for a short time, for the opportunity of putting matters right will occur almost immediately in the, treaty granting the interim surtaxes.Foreign Office, July 19, 1926.o
[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]CONFIDENTIAL.(12907)Annex II.MEMORANDUM ON BRITISH POLICY IN CHINA.IN discussing China it is very easy to lose oneself in a maze of detail so that it becomes difficult to see the wood for the trees. This, unfortunately, is due to the fact that decisions on questions of high policy depend on a correct appreciation of detail often minor technical detail to a degree which finds no parallel in our dealings with other countries. Although the Chinese imbroglio bristles with compli-cations in every direction, it will be the chief aim of this paper to include only those factors which are absolutely indispensable to a proper understanding of the broad political problem as it now confronts us, so that the main issues may stand out clearly and intelligibly.It will be convenient to begin with a short historical survey.Historical Survey.It is important to bear in mind from the outset that our position in China was originally built up on force; it was maintained up to the Great War on prestige, but the Chinese have now come to realise that unless there is- force behind it that is bluff. It is &quot;impossible to maintain our position on a rapidly dwindling prestige. We further labour under the disadvantage that our liberty of action is handicapped by international. agreements. In short, our impotence precludes our taking up a strong attitude and forces us to swim with the current. The gravity of the position lies not only in the fact that vast British interests are at stake, but that if the Chinese were to take the bit between their teeth, tear up the so-called unequal treaties, seize the Customs Administration and abolish extra-territoriality, it would shake our position in all Oriental countries to its foundations. Repercussions elsewhere, especially in India, might be very serious. The only consolation that we have is that we should, of course, not stand alone, because all the other Powers would also be affected. Nevertheless, we should stand to be the greatest losers in practically all respects.For forty years up to 1900 there was much ill-suppressed hatred and suspicion of foreigners, occasionally flaring up into outbreaks of violence. After the war of 1895, when China was decisively defeated by Japan, there was a general belief that China was about to break up, and the Powers, after the manner of those days, made ready to scramble for the pieces, and, as a preliminary step, attempted to divide up the country into spheres of influence. From 1895 to 1900 is the period of spheres of influence and the battle of the concessions, ending in the Boxer outbreak of 1900, when China made a desperate attempt to drive the hated foreigner from her shores. For this she was severely punished, but after 1900 we enter upon a new era. China accepted the foreigner as inevitable, and instead of trying to drive him out, set herself to learn from him and discover the secret of his strength. Her immemorial system of State examinations in the Confucian classics was abolished and a new system of State education on Western lines was instituted  a break with the past the significance of which it is difficult to exaggerate.The main feature of this new era was that the old blind hatred of the foreigner began to vanish completely and gave place to a spirit of nationalism which combined great personal friendliness for the foreigner and eagerness to profit by intercourse with him, with a growing feeling of resentment (which surer knowledge only made more bitter) at the injustice of the privileges enjoyed by foreigners and of the restraints imposed on Chinese sovereignty.If we look back into the history of China we shall find that she has passed through many political convulsions, especially when changes of dynasty have taken place, which have threatened her with disintegration. In the end, however, the centripetal forces have prevailed over those of disruption, so that she has always3561b [14161] [14897 b] b
succeeded in reuniting herself. The revolution of 1911 is, however, a greater epoch-making event than any of its predecessors in that it marks a far more abrupt and complete break with the traditions of the past. From being the oldest absolute monarchy in the world, China suddenly transformed herself into a modern and up-to-date republic, at any rate in theory. This transition was far too abrupt and far too drastic for a people who, by tradition, temperament and political education are so little capable of adapting themselves readily to a new order of things. Of all Constitutions, that of a modern republic presupposes a level of political education among the masses far higher than China yet possesses.For the first five years of the republic its destinies were bound up in the dominating personality of Yuan Shih-kai. So long as the reins of Government were in the hands of this sagacious statesman the spirit of the old dispensation was maintained while adhering to the forms of the new, and it seemed as if China might weather the storm. The most significant change was that in the provinces power insensibly passed from the Civil Governors (the successors of the Viceroys of Manchu days) into the hands of military leaders known as Tuchuns. So long as Yuan Shih-kai lived, he was able to keep the Tuchuns in check; indeed, they were his personal satellites; but with his death in 1916 the keystone of the political arch disappeared, and rivalry at once broke out among them. With it began the struggle for the supreme power in the State, which has lasted ever since and has plunged the country into a state of almost incessant civil war.The Tuchuns maintain vast armies it is estimated that there are at least 1,500,000 men under arms the upkeep of which tends more and more to absorb every available item of revenue, leaving insufficient either for essential provincial services or for the maintenance of the Central Government. China is torn by internecine strife and overrun by brigands. There are said to be about 1 million brigands, and the distinction between brigand and soldier is frequently apt to disappear. Since the death of Yuan Shih-kai Government has succeeded Government at Peking, and their authority often hardly extends beyond the walls of the capital. One and all are impotent, utterly discredited and always on the verge of bankruptcy. One and all have been nothing more than a faction in office, a mere shadow, quite unrepresentative of China as a whole. It is a curious fact, however, that the normal life of China should go on unperturbed in spite of all this political turmoil, which only resembles a ripple on the ocean. In many directions China has made solid and substantial progress, and the latest customs returns are a record of continual and steady increase in both revenue and trade. While the lessons of the past afford a hopeful sign as far as the eventual re-establishment of political unitjr is concerned, present indications point to increased decentralisation of Government and the gradual evolution of a Constitution on a federal basis when the present transition period comes to an end:The dominant factor in the present situation is the Nationalist movement, which is the strongest and most coherent force in China to-day. It owes its rapid growth to the new educational movement which began after 1900, and to the influence of Chinese students educated in Europe and America. Though it finds its most extreme and most vocal expression in the student class, it is not confined to them, but has taken root among Chinese of all classes and opinions. It is, of course, still an exceedingly small minority; but it is comparatively well organised and well led, and, therefore, a force with which the Powers have to reckon.British Policy compared with that of Other Powers.As regards the principles of our policy in China, these can be stated in a very few words. We have no territorial or imperialistic aims. Our first concern is to maintain our pre-eminent position in the trade of China, which is largely bound up with the prosperity of Hong Kong and the fortunes of the Maritime; Customs Administration, which is a vital British interest, and to secure adequate protection for British lives, property and business enterprises. Our second concern is to maintain the principle of the &apos;&apos; open door &apos;&apos; and equal opportunity for all and to see that China does not fall under the tutelage of any single Power. For these reasons we desire to see a united, well-ordered, prosperous and peaceful China, and it is our policy to endeavour to co-operate to that end with the other Great Powers concerned. These are the root principles underlying all our efforts in China.The value of concrete British interests in China is difficult to establish. A rough estimate under the various headings will be found in Annex I.
An account of the Maritime Customs Administration will be found in Annex II; but it may be well to describe briefly, in the words used by Sir R. Macleay in a recent telegram, our interest in this organisation: &quot;Great britain&apos;s principal interest in the customs may be defined as the maintenance of the customs service as the bedrock and basis of the whole structure of foreign trade in China, since with the disappearance of the customs we should in existing conditions of China revert to the state of things prevailing in the middle of last century, and trade would become impossible.&quot;It is no exaggeration to say that it is only the existence of the customs which enables foreign trade to be carried on and even to expand in face of the present internal chaos, and one can unquestionably maintain that upholding the Customs Administration at the present time is of incalculable importance and benefit to Chinese and foreign commercial interests alike.&quot;We have made some progress away from the days of spheres of influence and the battle of the concessions which preceded the Boxer outbreak, and it is now recognised, at any rate in theory, that co-operation rather than competition should be the guiding principle of the Powers in their dealings with China. The institution of the bankers&apos; consortium in 1913 (for the financing of China&apos;s future foreign loans) was the first step in that direction,, and the Nine-Power Pact of Washington represents a further extension of the principle of international co-operation in China.But notwithstanding the outward show of harmony among the Powers in their relations with China, it is impossible to ignore the underlying divergence of interests which renders co-operation in practice so difficult. The chief disturbing element in this respect is Japan. There is no gainsaying the fact that Japan, though she may not like chaos in China, does not, for very obvious reasons, want a strong and united China; while, unfortunately, Great Britain and America, though in essentials pursuing the same ends, often do not act in complete harmony owing to a fundamental difference of political outlook. France has considerably less interest in the &apos;East than any of the other Great Powers concerned. Her co-operation is unreliable and she is prone to use her position to seek her own ends rather than pursue an enlightened policy. A striking and disastrous instance of this is her action in delaying ratification of the Washington Customs Treaty for three years in order to force a settlement of the gold franc controversy, which is largely responsible for the general deterioration which has occurred in the interval.The Bolshevik policy of Russia is at present the most sinister influence in the Far East. It aims at freeing China from her treaty obligations and seeks to bring her within the orbit of the Soviet Union, and to this end has very skilfully exploited the Nationalist movement. The clamour for the abolition of unequal treaties, and the definitely anti-British channel into which the Nationalist movement has been guided is due to the direct inspiration of Moscow.Russia has surrendered her extra-territorial rights. The unfortunate mistake made by the Allies at Versailles in insisting upon Germany and Austria doing the same, together with the disappearance of the Capitulations in Turkey, have had a natural but embarrassing effect in encouraging China to become more and more insistent in her demand for similar concessions from the other Treaty Powers.China and the Powers :  the Paris Peace Conference.When China was prevailed upon to declare war against the Central Powers she was promised that the Allied G-governments would do all that rests with them to ensure that China shall enjoy, in international relations, the position and regard due to a great country. Her delegates at Versailles accordingly pressed upon the Peace Conference the abolition of extra-territoriality and complete tariff autonomy. The situation in China in 1919 was held not to justify these demands, and they were accordingly rejected. This and her treatment over the Shantung question served greatly to exacerbate Chinese anti-foreign feeling. The Chinese came away from Paris feeling very bitterly that they had been betrayed.The Washington Conference.The Washington Conference aimed at remedying many of the grievances which the Powers had by then come to recognise as just.   China again pressed for the[14161] b 2
surrender of extra-territoriality and for tariff autonomy, but although these were not granted, the conference resulted in a very large measure of capitulation to Chinese aspirations. Many of the concessions, were no doubt fully justified and overdue. Nevertheless, the Washington Conference taught the Chinese how easy it is to manoeuvre the Powers at an international conference into compliance with their demands a process which is being repeated with even greater success at Peking at this present moment. Washington produced four international instruments which &apos; definitely circumscribe and determine the policy of the Powers in the Far East generally.   They are : 1. The Four-Power Pact which neutralises and demilitarises Far Eastern waters.2. The Nine-Power Pact which guarantees the independence, sovereignty andadministrative integrity of China. 3. The China Customs Treaty. 4. A resolution respecting extra-territoriality.The first two are in the nature of self-denying ordinances, and lay down certain basic principles of policy. An account of them will be found in Annex III. It is, however, with the last two that we are more immediately concerned. The China Customs Treaty promised China an additional 1\ per cent, increase of her tariff, conditionally, and it provided that a special conference should meet to determine on what conditions the increase should be granted. The extra-territoriality resolution provided that a commission should be established to enquire into the whole question of extra-territorial jurisdiction with a view to its ultimate surrender.The issues which now confront us are 1. The surrender of extra-territoriality.2. What measures, if any, should be taken to guard against the dangers threatening the Customs Administration under tariff autonomy which has just been conceded by the Special Tariff Conference now sitting at Peking.Both these questions are of vital importance to us, but it is the latter which calls for immediate attention.The Extra-territoriality Commission.The commission which was convened in accordance with the Washington Conference resolution, referred to above, was to have met at Peking on the 18th December, 1925, but owing to the outbreak of civil war, the first meeting did not take place until the 12th January, 1926. All that need be said is that the British delegate, Sir Skinner Turner, judge of the Supreme Court at Shanghai, has received full instructions.   Briefly they are to the effect : 1. To enquire into the whole question of extra-territoriality and to recommend what steps should be taken to assist the Chinese to qualify themselves for the eventual surrender of extra-territoriality.2. To make such immediate concessions to remedy abuses as can be safely granted without affecting our vital interests.It is not necessary to go deeper into this matter at the present stage, but before dismissing this subject there is one point of great importance to which attention must be called. It is this. The surrender of extra-territorial rights is a matter of far greater importance to British interests than the economic effect of tariff concessions. It has therefore been part of our policy to incline to generosity as regards the latter in the hope that the Chinese will prove less difficult as regards the former.We have always been ready to admit that, both in regard to tariff matters as well as extra-territorial jurisdiction, the Chinese have very legitimate grievances which ought to have been redressed long ago. It is obvious that a flat &apos;ad valorem duty of 5 per cent., which was imposed on China some eighty years ago, and which may have been suitable to the trade of those days, is no longer appropriate to the changed conditions and character of China&apos;s trade, nor is it just in the face of the high tariff walls which have since sprung into existence in many countries against Chinese goods.   Similarly, there are many matters in connection with extra-territoriality
The Tariff Conference.We have, from the very start, always had grave misgivings as to the outcome of the Tariff Conference for the simple reason that it would, in practice, not only be found impossible to keep within the comparatively narrow scope contemplated at Washington, but also to escape from issues of the most far-reaching and dangerous character being raised. This is in fact what is happening. At the same time it is only fair to say that once the psychological moment for dealing with China&apos;s ills was allowed to pass, Washington or no Washington, we should sooner or later have had to face the situation with which we are now faced. The first thing therefore to realise is that the Tariff Conference, now sitting in Peking, is far from being the innocent offspring of the Washington Conference which it was originally intended to be. We are dealing with issues of fundamental political importance far transcending anything that Washington ever contemplated, and on the wisdom or unwisdom of the decisions to be taken will depend the whole course of future events and the fate of our whole position in the Far East.The spirit and intentions which animated the Washington Conference can be summed up in the words of Senator Underwood : &quot; A Government without money cannot govern.&apos;&apos;It was therefore agreed that China should be allowed to raise her tariff by 2-1 per cent, in order to provide the Central Government with funds for administra-tive purposes. Tt was apparently not realised that it does not follow that a Government in funds will necessarily govern, and that in the case of China the assumption on which this policy was based was fundamentally fallacious. It was, however, decreed that the extra 2-J per cent, were not to be unconditional, and it was decided that a special conference should meet to determine the conditions.The Japanese alone were opposed to the proposed extra 2J per cent., because it hit their trade in a higher degree than that of any other country, but they finally gave way. They made, however, one important reservation, namely, that if this increase was to be allowed, they would expect their unsecured debts to be secured on the increased customs revenues.His Majesty&apos;s Government are more concerned about the welfare of China than our own immediate trade interests, because such a course is not only in the long run the wisest, but will also redound to our greater advantage. Our chief aim has, there-fore, been to further a constructive policy so far as this is compatible with non-interference in the internal affairs of China. The constructive element resides essentially in the guarantees and conditions which can be exacted from the Chinese in return for the promised benefits. Therefore, in framing the original instructions to the British delegates, we laid great stress on two points : 1. Guarantees for substantial progress towards the abolition of li-kin. 2. A minimum of the increased revenues to be devoted to administrative and a maximum to constructive purposes.Stated briefly, this means that while we were quite ready to accept the extra burden of 2^ per cent, on trade, we were determined not to throw away our bargaining power without some effort to induce the Chinese to put their house in order.which are out of date and which have become abuses and call for a speedy remedy. Indeed, it is the tardy action of the Powers in dealing with these abuses that is largely responsible for the present intense anti-foreign feeling. It was the intention of the Washington Conference that such legitimate grievances as China might have should be met by the Powers in a spirit of sympathy and generosity. There is no fault to find With the principle of this policy. It is intrinsically eminently just and sound. It is not in the merits of the policy where the trouble lies, but in the fact that it is proposed to carry it out at a time when, owing to the internal dissensions above described, and the general state of chaos, China is now even less capable of benefiting by it than she was, say, twenty years ago, not to speak of the practical difficulties of giving effect to it. For such a policy to be successful implies at least a Govern-ment in effective authority over the whole country. Flad it been attempted in the time of Yuan Shih-kai, or at latest in Paris in 1919, the present crisis might have been averted. As will be presently seen, the remedy which the policy is intended to apply may prove worse than the disease.
The two matters which have just been referred to, li-kin and the unsecured debt, are two of the biggest questions with which the Tariff Conference will have to deal, and an explanation of them will be found in Annexes IV and V. Li-kin is a comprehensive name for a multitude of vexatious, and for the most part illegal, taxes on trade levied in the interior of China. The delays, uncertainty and obstruc-tion which it causes are a greater incubus on trade even than the amount actually extorted in taxation. It is recognised by both Chinese and foreigners as a great evil, but it has so far baffled all efforts to abolish it.The unsecured debt is an even more difficult and dangerous problem. For the most part it represents money borrowed at home and abroad by dishonest and profligate means and squandered for their own private ends by the politicians for the time being in control at Peking. The foreign lenders comprise a number of nations, but while the Japanese are the worst offenders, the British fortunately are only involved to the extent of about 5 per cent, of the whole. It is possible that this power of pledging the resources of all China in the interests of a faction representing only a fraction of the whole may be the real root of all the civil wars of recent years, and it is almost certain that the Powers will incur great odium in China if they press for or undertake any responsibility in respect of the consolidation of these debts on the security of the customs.The Japanese loans are composed principally of what are known as the Nishihara loans. They were made during the years 1916-18 through the agency of a certain Mr. Nishihara to the Anfu Government, which was a Government dominated by Japanese influence. The loans were made secretly and entirely without security, their object being to maintain that Government in power and to assist them in their struggle with the south. Though the Japanese Government were behind these loans, they were negotiated independently of the Japanese Legation at Peking. The proceeds were spent chiefly in military equipment. In addition to these loans, there are British, French and American unsecured debts. These, however, are small in comparison with the Japanese loans, but they are all transactions of more or less doubtful morality, with this difference, however, that all except the Japanese loans Avere purely business debts and represented tangible assets in exchange for money. All these loan transactions have caused much heart-burning in the provinces  especially in Canton but none aroused greater resentment than the Nishihara loans. Our prestige in China has already^ sunk sufficiently low. Are we going to improve it by associating ourselves with such clandestine transactions as the Nishihara loans ?In the course of preparing the instructions to the British delegates, it was discovered that, if the Japanese reservation in regard to unsecured debts were to hold good, it would mean that the proposed increased revenue would be entirely absorbed in the service of these loans, thereby reducing the conference to a debt-collecting agency, and completely defeating the intention of &quot;Washington, not to mention the dangerous political complications to which it would give rise. An effort was accordingly made to secure the elimination of the unsecured debt question from the discussions of the conference; but although the State Department at Washington at one time agreed, it very soon became apparent that the pressure from the Japanese, French and other Governments interested would be so great that this would be impossible. Having been forced most reluctantly to abandon this m idea, we then took up the line that, if the unsecured debt question had to be dealt with, then we must insist on the scope of the conference being enlarged, by which we meant an increase beyond the Washington 2^ per cent, surtax, in order to provide funds for the constructive purposes which we had in mind, without which it would be impossible to give effect to the spirit and intentions of the Washington Conference. An elaborate scheme of fiscal reconstruction was prepared (the Teichman scheme), which, although admittedly a counsel of perfection, nevertheless represents the definite goal at which we are aiming. This roughly was the position up to June 1925. Up to that date all these questions were in the forefront of our programme, but the landslide which has since overtaken the Tariff Conference seemed to us to have relegated them to the background and to have effected a complete change of front. They are therefore only stated here in the briefest manner, in order not to lose the thread of the narrative.The landslide was the direct result of the events in Shanghai of the 30th May, 1925, but before we deal with them and the new situation in China which has arisen out of them, it is desirable to bear in mind that at the time our instructions to our delegates to the Tariff Conference were drafted our minds were still working in terms of the old dispensation.   We contemplated
no radical changes in the political situation or in the relations between China and the Powers; we still thought of using our influence to promote an orderly and united China, and of ensuring that the Powers&apos; control over customs revenues should be exercised with this end in view; we still contemplated &apos;&apos; granting &apos;&apos; her a moderate increase in revenue, attaching thereto such conditions as would make the concession beneficial to China as a whole and so manifest the benevolence of our intentions.Events of May 30, 1925, and their Effect on the Tariff Conference.It is now necessary to give some account of the events which precipitated this landslide, thereby producing such a profound change and bringing us to the present dangerous situation. On the 30th May there occurred in the International Settlement at Shanghai a riot in consequence of a Chinese being killed by a Japanese in a Japanese mill, which resulted in several Chinese being shot by British police officers servants of the International Municipal Council. This at once fanned into fury anti-foreign feeling throughout the country, which ultimately became markedly anti-British. The cry for abolition of the &apos;&apos; unequal treaties &apos;&apos;&apos; spread like wild-fire, and the general effervescence was exploited to the full by the Bolsheviks. This was immediately followed by an unfortunate shooting incident, provoked by the Reds,- at the gates of the foreign concession at Canton. These incidents have been deliberately used by the Chinese Nationalists, who will not regard them as satisfactorily settled until the utmost concessions have been extorted from the Powers. Strikes and boycotts of Japanese and British especially British  trade ensued and have lasted ever since, Avith the result that it has nearly ruined Hong Kong and inflicted untold injury on British trade generally. The clamour for full fiscal autonomy and the complete surrender of extra-territoriality became so insistent that the Powers were practically stampeded into acquiescence in the principle of tariff autonomy being discussed at the forthcoming conference and to hastening on the meeting of the Extra-territoriality Commission. The Powers, nevertheless, were agreed among themselves that tariff autonomy should on no account be granted at once but only by stages over a number of years and subject to conditions. On this point it was of the utmost importance for the Powers to stand firm in order to give time for China to settle down and for the Powers to adjust themselves to the new conditions.When at last, after the lapse of three years, the Tariff Conference opened at Peking on the 26th October, 1925, it did so under the worst possible auspices, in a tense and hostile atmosphere, and the Chinese delegation was completely dominated by Nationalists backed by Bolshevik influences. In the interval the situation had steadily deteriorated. The anti-foreign feeling, though past the fever-heat of last slimmer, was still running high. The prospect of more revenue flowing into Peking seemed to have been the signal for a renewed outbreak of civil war, so that instead of only two or three contending war lords there are now at least double that number, while simultaneously a mysterious increase in the estimate of the unsecured debt from 600 to 1,500 million dollars has taken place. The solidarity among the Powers on the question of tariff autonomy by steps seems to have crumbled at the first impact, for within three weeks they agreed to the grant of tariff autonomy on the 1st January,-1929. This was largely due to the attitude of Japan and America. From that moment what we had feared all along to be a possibility became a certainty, namely, that we should be fighting a rearguard action, and all our efforts would have to be devoted to prevent it from being turned into a rout. It is hardly any longer a question of pursuing a constructive policy but of saving what we can from the wreck. It is true that the Central Government simultaneously declared that on their part they would abolish li-kin by the date fixed for the granting of tariff autonomy. Until the remaining articles of the treaty have been negotiated, it is impossible to say how far tariff autonomy is to be made dependent on the abolition of li-kin. The point, however, is of little practical value, because it is tolerably certain that whatever else may or may not happen, the Powers will not in the present temper of the Chinese escape having to grant tariff autonomy, while it is in the highest degree improbable that , the Chinese Government will be able to solve the li-kin problem by a mere stroke of the pen, when it has baffled far stronger Governments in the past.Whatever may be secured towards the abolition of li-kin is, of course, to be welcomed even if it is only a paper guarantee that can be appealed to in the future, but in the present state of China it is difficult to believe that it can be anything
else, though it is only fair to say that Sir R. Macleay feels hopeful that something will be. accomplished. As regards the interim surtaxes, it looks as if they will be raised to such a figure that the proceeds from them will probably represent the maximum that can be squeezed from foreign trade, even under tariff autonomy.If the conference at the very outset has resulted in the landslide, it is difficult to see where it Avill end. It has once more demonstrated to the Chinese in the most unmistakable manner the impotency of the Powers. They will not be slow to exploit it to the full in the future. The quasi-immediate grant of tariff autonomy seemed to us te have so completely altered the whole situation that in order to meet the serious dangers which we saw looming ahead we thought it necessary to seek a new orientation of policy.We argued that if the vastly increased revenues which tariff autonomy will produce are to be allowed to flow into the exchequer of Peking it will, far from improving the situation, perpetuate and intensify strife among the contending war lords for the possession of the capital. Nor would the danger be less if the whole of the customs revenues were absorbed in the service of the secured loans and the unsecured, debt, for while in that case Peking might cease to be the objective, the antagonism between Canton and the North would probably be intensified. The Customs Administration would be burdened with the service of the unsecured debts and the handling of the enormous surplus revenues for the benefit of Peking, so that the Powers would be erecting a fabric which might bid fair to antagonise the rest of China, would place them morally in an indefensible position and might provoke a direct attack on the customs, ultimately involving its complete collapse. It may be maintained that the Maritime Customs Administration can be defended because the ports are accessible to the navies of the Great Powers. True, but the collection of revenue by force by the Powers for the benefit of the faction at Peking is morally wholly indefensible and might easily rouse all China against the foreigner. If Canton, for example, were to seize the revenue, as indeed she constantly threatens to do, or adopt the still more dangerous course of establishing a separate custom-house of her own, her example would probably be followed by one port after another. The Customs Administration, as we now know it, would disappear. The Salt Administration might next be attacked; the concessions and settlements might follow, and, finally, the whole extra-territorial system might disappear. How were these dangers to be averted ? This brings us straight to the crux of the present situation, which calls for a decision on a principle of policy of paramount importance in the first instance, namely, whether we are to continue to regard Peking as exclusively entitled to the customs revenues or to admit the participation of the provinces.Peking and the Provinces.If the dangers to which attention has been called are real and not exaggerated, some effort to guard against them would seem to be imperative. At first sight the most obvious solution would appear to lie in some form of provincial participation in the customs revenues on a pro ratd basis. This would of course involve a radical modification of the present practice, by which the customs revenues are collected under foreign supervision for the exclusive benefit of the Central Government. This practice arose out of the natural instinct of the Powers to look to Peking as the mouthpiece for the whole Empire; and later, under the changed conditions of the republic and under the stimulus of the foreign bondholder, they drifted gradually and almost imperceptibly into a policy of supporting Peking against the provinces. This policy has hot been deliberately adopted; it has grown up partly out of solicitude for the service of the foreign loans secured on the customs, and partly under the influence of the usually tacit assumption that the unification of China under one central authority (as was the case before the revolution of 1911) is the normal state of affairs, and that a return to the normal is not only desirable but possible in a not distant future. So long as Peking was in fact, and not merely in name, the capital, and so long as the authority of the -Central Government was acknowledged and obeyed by the rest of China, the practice of applying the whole customs revenue to the purposes of the Central Government was perhaps justifiable. If there were a reasonable hope that China would return to the presumed normal state of centralisation within a short space of years, there would be strong argument for a continuation of foreign support for this practice. But the chronic state of inter-provincial war into which China has -fallen and the
loss of all effective authority by the Central Government shows that such a hope is extremely slender, and in these changed circumstances the financing of a phantom Central Government by foreign support to the detriment of the provinces has become less easy to defend. The case was clearly put by the late Sir John Jordan, than whom there can be no greater authority, in a letter to the &quot; Times &quot; on the 18th August, 1923.  In that letter Sir John (who was then in retirement) said : &quot; Up till the China-Japan War of 1894 the revenues of the country were apportioned between Peking and the provinces under a delicate system of adjustment, which taxed the richer provinces for the benefit of the weaker ones, and worked tolerably well all round. All this has been changed during the last thirty years, and it must be admitted that the trend of foreign policy has been to favour Peking at the expense of the provinces which, as Sir Robert Hart has told us, resented, even in his time, the invasion of their preserves by the Central Government. In&apos; those days the provinces received six-tenths of the foreign customs revenue. That revenue has in the intervening years become the security for a succession of foreign and domestic loans, and the provinces have not only lost that important source of supply, but have seen the native customs revenue and li-kin mortgaged as security for foreign loans. Lastly, by a transaction for which I have a full share of responsibility, the salt revenue was pledged for a further loan and withdrawn from provincial control. I am not questioning the propriety of these transactions but merely calling attention to the result they have produced. That result has been that the provinces have ceased to send any revenue to Peking, have annexed salt and other revenues which are pledged for foreign loans, and have in fact declared a system of fiscal autonomy which has reduced Peking to a shadow, and which precludes the establishment of any central authority in the country. And what is the remedy? One suggestion is that we should proceed on the old lines, increase customs revenues and apply the proceeds to the liquidation of China&apos;s unsecured indebtedness, amounting to about  100 million. Some of these loans were contracted in circumstances which will not bear close investigation, nearly all of them were wasted, and others were used to make war against the provinces. This suggestion is not therefore likely to find much favour outside of Peking.&quot; Another proposal is that the foreign Powers should provide money for the disbandment of China&apos;s useless armies, should take charge of their rifles and equipment, and should undertake to prevent the importation of more arms into China. Having tried one experiment in the disbandment line, which proved a miserable fiasco, I should be reluctant to advise the expenditure of British money on another.&quot; On the whole I am inclined to favour the proposal that the conference on the customs surtax should be enlarged so as to include in its programme a study of the whole fiscal relations between Peking and the provinces. The conference should be held at Shanghai and should include representatives from all the provinces and from the Chinese chambers of commerce and other public bodies. The attitude of the latter, judging from their response to the appeals made to them by the British and American chambers, has not, so far, been encouraging, but the Chinese are, after all, an eminently reasonable people, and they must realise the grave danger attaching to a continuance of the present situation. The Tuchuns, too, should welcome an opportunity of composing their quarrels. They are not all equally bad. Yen Hsi-shan has proved an excellent Governor of Shansi for the last twelve years ; Lu Yung-hsiang is admitted, even by those who object to his taxation methods, to be a capable administrator; and even Chang Tso-lin has his British admirers who aver that his Government in Manchuria is much better than is generally represented. Sun Yat-sen has now composed his differences with the Hong Kong Government and has already declared in favour of a conference. Without Chinese co-operation no effective or permanent remedy can be found for the ills from which China is suffering.&quot;Five years before this, on the occasion of the first direct challenge by one of the provinces (Canton) to the system under which, thanks to foreign support, the whole customs revenues went to the Central Government, Sir John Jordan, at that time still His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking, had placed on record his view on this same question in the following words : [14161]c
&apos;&apos; My own view is that the Allied Powers may soon be called upon to review their attitude towards the Peking Government. It is inequitable and contrary to the professed principles of the Allies that the customs surplus revenue should be allocated to a military authority (Peking) which controls less than half the country to enable it to carry on a civil war in a futile attempt to reduce the other half.&quot;It is important to notice that so eminent an authority as Sir John Jordan definitely advocated, both in 1918 and in 1923. a modification of the practice of affording exclusive support to Peking. Nevertheless, the Legation at Peking since Sir John&apos;s retirement has consistently held that the Powers should support the Central Government.The Past Policy.It is now necessary to examine a little more closely the origin and development of the system under which the Central Government has, with the support of the foreign Powers, extended its hold over the national revenues and applied them to its own purposes, the abuses to which that system has given rise, and the past reaction of the provinces to it.In considering these questions, it is well to remember that the year 1911 marks an epoch in Chinese history. Before that date there was a monarchical Government in Peking recognised and more or less obeyed in China as a whole; since that date China has been a republic, and never since the first few years after the proclamation of the republic has any Government in Peking for any substantial period exercised its authority over more than half the country. Since 1918 there has been in existence at Canton a rival and quasi-independent Government, which still regards itself as the Government, not simply of the Province of Kwangtung or of South China generally, but of the whole of China itself.There is no doubt that the process of financial centralisation finds its origin in the impact between China and the outside world. It was to pay a war indemnity that China first had recourse to borrowing from foreigners on the security of the customs revenues, and when the heat generated by the impact gave rise to the Boxer rising of 1900, it was largely to the customs revenues that China turned in order to pay the indemnity exacted from her by the Powers. The result was that, while in 1894, prior to the era of foreign loans, the provinces, under a natural system of checks and balances, enjoyed 60 per cent, of the customs revenues, by 1901 the whole of the customs revenues had been hypothecated for the service of foreign obligations. It is not surprising, incidentally, that the provinces should have turned to purely local exactions like li-kin as a means of raising the revenues necessary for their administration. The important point is, however, that though the Central Government appropriated these customs revenues to meet foreign obligations, it w*as still able to do so on its own authority without invoking the direct assistance of foreign Powers; and though the Customs Administration was staffed largely by foreigners, mostly British, under a British Inspector-General of Customs (Sir Robert Hart), the Customs Administration did not actually handle the customs revenues, but merely supervised their collection. The customs duties themselves were paid by the merchant into Chinese banks, whose receipt was delivered to the customs officer as authority for the release of the goods, and the proceeds were remitted by the local Chinese authorities to the Taotai at Shanghai, the Chinese official responsible for the service of foreign loans.That there was a limit beyond which the Central Government could not go m imposing a system of financial and administrative centralisation upon the provinces is proved by the revolution of 1911, which was itself in essence the result of a protest by the provinces against the pretensions of a Government at Peking to enjoy financial and administrative authority which it was no longer strong enough or repre-sentative enough to enforce. For present purposes, however, it is only necessary to show that the revolution marked a turning-point in the financial relations between China and the foreign Powers. In 1911, owing to revolutionary disorders, there was danger of default on foreign obligations as a result of a possible seizure or retention by the provincial authorities of the customs revenues, the whole of which were required to be remitted to Shanghai if default on foreign loans was to be averted. The result was an arrangement made between the foreign Powers and the Central Government, at the instance of Sir John Jordan, under which (1) customs revenues were to be actually collected and handled by the Customs Administration; (2) the
revenues were to be lodged for safety in foreign custodian banks; and (3) the Diplomatic Body were constituted trustees of the whole customs revenue. So long as the entire revenue was absorbed in the service of the foreign debts, this arrangement could hardly be criticised; but when surpluses subsequently fell in, the trusteeship was interpreted to mean that no release of free revenue could be made to the Chinese Government without their sanction.  Hence all the trouble.This measure, which was originally designed merely as a temporary expedient for safeguarding the interests of the foreign bondholder, has insensibly drawn the Powers and especially Great Britain into an unwarrantable practice of inter-ference in Chinese internal affairs and has brought the Maritime Customs Administration into the vortex of Chinese domestic politics. So long as the whole of the customs revenues were required for the service of foreign obligations, the^e was justification for the 1912 arrangement, and its immediate effects were beneficial; but by the time China came into the war in 1917 the situation had completely altered. The customs receipts had steadily risen since 1911; four out of the seven foreign loans secured on the customs had been paid off; on China&apos;s becoming a belligerent the German and Austrian Boxer indemnities were cancelled; the service of the British, French, Japanese and American indemnities was suspended for five years, while Russia suspended one-third of her share. The net result was that, from 1917 onwards, the customs revenues were no longer entirely swallowed up in meeting foreign obligations, but showed a surplus which went to the Central Government, though only on release by authority of the Diplomatic Body, who were now, therefore, protecting the interests not merely of their own bondholders (as intended by the 1912 arrangement), but those of the faction for the time being in office in Peking. (The cancelled and suspended portions of the Boxer indemnity were, for technical reasons, never treated as customs surplus and, there-fore, reached the Central Government without having to be released by the Diplomatic Body.)A further complication was introduced in 1921 when the Central Government, on the advice of Sir F. Aglen, Inspector-General of Customs, who very unwisely aspired to the role of protector of the domestic bondholders, issued a mandate appropriating the whole customs surplus, after foreign obligations had been met, together with the funds accruing from the cancelled and suspended indemnities, for the service of existing domestic loans and placed him in charge of the consolidated domestic loan service. This mandate appears, curiously enough, to have drawn no comment from the Diplomatic Body.That the Diplomatic Body were still regarded as occupying the position of trustees of the customs surplus is proved by the fact that during a financial crisis at the end of. 1921 the Chinese Government, met by a refusal by the inspector-general to release to them 6 million taels out of a total of 10 million accumulated by him as a sinking fund for the consolidated loan service, requested the Diplomatic Body to order him to comply. The Diplomatic Body, on the advice of the British Minister, took the view that the mandate of 1921 must be upheld because foreigners had purchased domestic loans on the faith of it, and refused to order the inspector-general to pay over the money. This decision of the Diplomatic Body appears, therefore, to have placed the inspector-general in complete and permanent control of the whole customs revenue. He has used this authority not merely to consolidate existing internal loans, but, on one or two occasions, to float new ones for the benefit of the factions in office at Peking.Applications continue to be made by the Chinese Government to the Diplomatic Body for small releases from the customs surplus for specific purposes. Some are granted, some are refused.It will thus be seen that, by this final act, the Diplomatic Body committed the Powers up to the hilt to the policy of supporting Peking against the provinces. If, as will be. shown hereafter, the collection of customs revenues has been safeguarded in the last resort only by threat of force by the Powers, it should be remarked that the Powers have drifted into the position of opposing what Sir John Jordan regarded as a justifiable demand by the provinces, not simply in the interests of their bondholders (a steadily dimininishing interest the service of foreign-secured loans, not including the indemnity, now accounts for only 23,500,000 taels out of a total customs revenue of 81 million taels), but of a faction in office at Peking and Chinese holders of domestic loans. The prestige of the Customs Administration has become damaged in the eyes of China as a whole, through the inspector-general unwisely engaging himself in large consolidation schemes in the name of a Govern-[14161]   &quot; c 2
merit which relies on foreign Powers for the collection of the necessary revenue. It is difficult to see what justification there is for such a position. There have been protests in the past, as will now be shown. We feared that if the same policy were adopted in respect of the increased customs revenues resulting from the conference the outcome would be the wreck of the Customs Administration.The resentment of the provinces against Peking, which Sir John Jordan says already existed in Sir R. Harfs days, has manifested itself with ever-growing intensity as a direct result of the policy described above. It is unnecessary to enter into the precise circumstances of each challenge to the right of the Peking Government to dispose of the national customs revenues. Suffice it to say that on five separate occasions the Canton Government has threatened to seize the customs, and that on each occasion the Cantonese have only yielded to a show of force, i.e., an international naval demonstration. The first threat (1918) followed closely upon China&apos;s entry into the war, when for the first time (as shown above) there was a free surplus (subject to release by the Diplomatic Body) after foreign obligations had been met. This confirms what the Canton Government have invariably stated, namely, that they are ready to respect foreign obligation and claim only their share of the revenues left over after they have been met; they do not, of course, recognise the mandate of 1921 and the inspector-generahs consolidation service. What the Canton Government proposed to do in 1918 was to take over the custom-house, to leave the foreign staff undisturbed, - but to appropriate all the revenues, setting aside a proportion, later estimated at 13 per cent., as Canton&apos;s share of the foreign debt. Sir John Jordan&apos;s view of the claims of Canton has already been quoted. It was decided, nevertheless, to send gunboats to overawe Canton, and this measure was successful. The Powers were convinced that to agree to the Cantonese demand would be to perpetuate the division between North and South China and to destroy all hope of unity, in which they still believed; and they thought that to preserve the integrity of the customs revenues would be the best means of promoting it.Further threats followed in 1919, 1920, 1921 and 1923. In 1924, when a new internal loan was floated by the inspector-general on the security of the customs surplus for the benefit of the Peking faction, there was another scare at Canton and the gunboats were again hastily assembled; but on this occasion neither threat nor demonstration materialised.In a recent despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking, Sir J. Jamieson. His Majesty&apos;s consul-general at Canton, describes the present situation as follows : &quot;In so far as it may be possible in existing local conditions to gauge the attitude of the local authorities towards the conference, I incline to the opinion that it corresponds with the views put before the British delegation on the 25th November by the Students&apos; Tariff Autonomy League, and that unless Peking listens to and adopts the advice tendered by the delegates sent up from here, Kwangtung will have nothing to do with any decisions which may be arrived at in the north.&quot; I do not think that the Nationalist Government will in the end repudiate payment of the provinces&apos; proportionate indebtedness in respect of foreign loans already secured by the customs revenues, but they will almost certainly decline to hand over the proceeds of any increase over present tariff rates which may hereafter be agreed upon.&quot;In a still more recent telegram (No. 5 of the 2nd February, 1926) Sir J. Jamieson says : &quot; Canton aims at the abolition of all that is comprised in the phrase &apos; unequal treaties.&apos;   The fiction of control by Peking should be abandoned.&quot;A concrete illustration of the attitude of Canton may be found in a speech delivered at Swatow on the 7th November last by Chiang Kai-Shek, Commander-in-chief of the Cantonese forces, after his capture of that town. In his speech he stated that &quot;the resumption of control over the Maritime Customs&quot; was one of the objects at which he was aiming.   -Apart from Canton, there were threats by Chang Tso-lin in 1922 and 1924 against the Manchurian customs, and in 1925 there was some fear that Wu Pei-fu might seize the customs at Hankow.There is thus ample evidence as to the attitude of the provinces on this subject. As already stated, the maintenance of the Customs Administration is a vital interest to us, and on that score the original action taken by the Diplomatic Body in 1912 can be justified.   Subsequent developments are less easy to defend.   And
when it is remembered that (as Sir John Jordan said) there is substantial justice behind the demands of Canton, the matter begins to assume a much more doubtful complexion. And it is likely that the temptation to Canton to carry her threats into execution will be greatly increased when the total customs revenue rises, as it is expected to do, from 70 to 170 million dollars on the levying of the higher customs rates approved by the conference and to perhaps an even higher figure when China resumes her tariff autonomy.Events may at any moment impose a decision upon His Majesty&apos;s Government, for they may again be faced with a threat to the customs. It will be necessary to decide at short notice whether the precedent of naval demonstrations is to be followed or not. The present memorandum shows that the policy of intimidation, even if successful, is difficult to defend; yet the alternative may be to yield to a threat, and this would involve the ultimate destruction of the&quot; Customs Administration. It would seem, therefore, that search should be made for a policy which will avert threats in the future and prevent us from sinking deeper into the mire.Alternative New Policies.In considering any policy of non-interference in Chinese financial affairs as an alternative to the policy of interference, the character ^and evident dangers of which have been described above, it is material to- consider whether in supporting Peking against the provinces the Powers are not running counter to the direction in which China is naturally developing. China has been in a state of disunion since the revolu-tion of 1911. The question is: Has the effective authority of a Central Government gone for ever, or can it be restored, and, if so, within what period ? The Powers have hitherto acted, and still act, on the apparent assumption that unity in China is natural, desirable and possible, and they have considered it their duty and to their advantage to promote unity.The revolution of 1911 destroyed the fiscal system of the Chinese Government with the solitary exception of the Maritime Customs Administration, which seemed, indeed, to emerge from, the shock with heightened prestige and increased responsi-bilities. On it the Powers built their hopes of restoring the fiscal unity of China, and took control over the customs revenues in the hope that, if a strong Central Govern-ment emerged from the revolutionary chaos, it could resume control of the fiscal machine without serious breach of continuity. They also believed that they could use their control over the customs revenues for the benefit of China herself, and they have retained that control in the hope that they might thereby promote unity. This is the meaning of the 1912 agreement and the constant support of the Central Govern-ment against the provinces, and also, curiously enough, of the inspector-generahs consolidation scheme, for he honestly regards that scheme as of benefit to Chinese credit and of constructive value to China as a whole, and therefore as conducive to unity. Unfortunately, the reaction of China to these efforts on her behalf has not been what the inspector-general and the Powers anticipated. Instead of promoting union, the exotic system they have built up has fomented disunion; it has not been an aid, but an obstacle and a danger. And if, as the signs of the times appear to show, it is improbable, that Peking will ever regain its former position, and if the tide has set towards decentralisation, leading eventually to some form of federal con-stitution with a large measure of provincial autonomy, then the Powers are taking a useless and dangerous responsibility in trying to preserve a complicated and irritating centralised fiscal administration. The opinion is steadily growing that, if China is to be united, union must come voluntarily from within, and not by force from without; that if there is to be an effective and representative Central Government at all, the provinces must be allowed to feel the need of it and to set it up themselves. If this is true, the Powers wyould be wise to reduce their commitments and to strip their system of control down to the bare minimum sufficient to safeguard their own special interests, viz., the service of the not very large secured foreign loans and the integrity of the pur el y supervisory customs machinery. If they fail to do this, and if at the conference ttiey make themselves and the inspector-general and the Customs Administration responsible for the disposal of 100 million dollars of new revenues for the purposes of the Central Government, it is feared that disaster may easily result.These are all exceedingly strong arguments for a reversal of the policy of supporting Peking against the provinces. The question is how this should be done. Two remedies have been considered, but unfortunately neither has found favour with the British delegation to the Tariff Conference.   These are: 
1. A system of provincial allocation of customs revenues.2. A more drastic method of divesting ourselves of all responsibility for surplus revenues by withdrawing from the arrangement of 1912 and limiting our control strictly to the minimum necessary for the protection of the foreign-secured bondholder.31 trnWM fB ] .     .   till .Provincial Allocation.The suggestion for a scheme of provincial allocation was put to Sir E. Macleay as early as 1923, but rejected by him. It was repeated to the British delegation in the following terms : &quot; The Peking Government will try, under tariff autonomy, to wring the last drop out of the customs machinery. In proportion as they succeed there will be a direct incentive to increased provincial disintegration, since the more cash for Peking, the greater the grievance of independent authorities having no share in the spoils. This sense of injustice may ultimately recoil on the Powers by provoking an attack on the customs machinery and stimulating anti-foreign feeling. Hence a solution of the provincial quota problem is of paramount political importance to all the Powers alike. It seems to us that at this juncture the Peking Government should he told plainly that, while having no desire to interfere in a matter of China&apos;s internal administration, we cannot accept the responsibility of adopting a course which seems certain to provoke an outburst of civil war, and that therefore iv&amp; comnot sign a treaty granting tariff autonomy unless the Peking Government first comes to an arrangement actually accepted, by the chief provincial leaders for a division of customs revenues amongst the provinces.&quot;The ways and means of doing this were considered. The alternatives were to consult with the Americans, French and Japanese beforehand or to make a declaration at the conference, merely informing them the day previously. The second method might enable us to take a lead and might restore our prestige and possibly ameliorate the strike and boycott situation in South China. If the Powers did not come into line, we should at least have cleared ourselves of responsibility for. the evils when they occurred. The possibility of direct consultation with the provincial leaders was not to be excluded.To this the British delegation replied as follows :  &quot; We have pointed out repeatedly to Wang and Yen (the chief Chinese representatives at the conference) that the root difficulty of concluding any treaty is the question of provincial concurrence in any arrangement made. We do not think the moment opportune for making any public declaration on the subject; if made at all it should be made at a much later date, and possibly some sort of provincial concurrence might be made a condition of ratification. It appears impossible to lay down any allocation to the provinces of customs revenues &quot; (other than the proceeds of the proposed special customs surtax to be levied in order to allow of the payment of compensation to the provinces in lieu of the li-kin revenues which they are to lose under the li-kin abolition scheme). &quot; We should at once be accused of an attempt to regulate the internal finances of China, which, in any case, is probably outside the range of practical politics at the present time. Any separate consultation with the provincial authorities would be practically hopeless in the present chaos.&quot;Withdrawal from the Custodian Bank Agreement.That His Majesty&apos;s Government have the right to withdraw from the agreement of 1912 is incontestable. The question is whether it is politically expedient. What would be the consequence of taking such a drastic step ? The immediate effect would be that a new arrangement would have to be negotiated to take its place, providing that the responsibility of guarding and remitting customs collections should be placed upon Chinese officials and not upon foreigners. Although this would place the foreign bondholder in precisely the same position as he was in before the Diplomatic Body assumed control of the customs revenues, he would probably, nevertheless, rightly or wrongly, accuse His Majesty&apos;s Government of throwing him to the wolves.   Therefore^ reversion to the pre-1912 system without
some modification to meet this case seems to be impracticable. This difficulty is, however, probably not insurmountable. It should be possible to devise a system under which the customs commissioners would retain the minimum necessary to meet the service of the foreign-secured loans before handing the balance over to the Chinese authorities.By far the most important point is that, if Great Britain were to take the lead in proposing to the Powers to abandon foreign control over the customs revenues as. part of a policy of genuine non-interference in the domestic affairs of China, it might go a long way to restore our damaged prestige and win back the friendship and confidence of the Chinese. It should strengthen the moderate section of the Nationalists and, most important of all, it might cut the ground from under the feet of the Red faction at present in control of Canton. Further, it would relieve us of all responsibility for the domestic loans and impose on Chinese financial interests the duty of looking after themselves instead of invoking the protection of foreigners against their own countrymen.Lastly, it would save us from becoming associated with Japan and the Latin Powers in forcing foreign control upon China, for the purpose of consolidating the vast unsecured debt, most of which represents transactions of an exceedingly shady character, both financially and politically, and which we have every reason to believe would rouse the further resentment of the provinces. It would also avert the danger of Peking becoming the focus of internal strife and thus remove one of the chief causes of civil wars. In a word, we should be cutting the Gordian knot and freeing ourselves from the utterly indefensible position into which we have drifted and thus escape the danger of becoming more and more embroiled in Chinese domestic affairs, with which the present course of the Tariff Conference seems to threaten us.At first sight, therefore, there is much to recommend such a policy, but there is another side to the picture. Even if it is morally and in other respects the right course to pursue, there are so many interests bound up with our present policy that it becomes questionable whether it is even a practical proposition. The pros and cons have, therefore, to be very carefully considered. First and foremost, it would probably lead to a break-up of the- conference, and with it would go all prospect of doing anything constructive for China and obtaining any progress towards the abolition of li-kin not that those prospects seem by any means bright in the present circumstances. Then there is the question of the position of Peking. Would the effect be to destroy its position as the capital and thus lead to the disruption of China ? Can the position be made worse than it is at present ? The Central Government would no doubt greatly resent our action, but would that very much matter? All these are questions which require an answer. One thing is certain. We should antagonise all the Powers interested in the unsecured debts, as they would then be left to make their own arrangements with the Chinese Government. Of these, of course, the principal is Japan. As regards America, the policy suggested should harmonise with her general political attitude towards China, which is, in general, the avoidance of interference in Chinese domestic affairs. It should be remembered that it was on this ground that America refused to participate in the Reorganisation Loan of 1913, the terms of which she regarded as derogatory to Chinese sovereignty. In these circumstances, it would obviously be most unwise to spring such a policy on the conference. Therefore, if it were decided to adopt it, it would, in the interests of our good relations with the other Powers, be essential to endeavour to come to some understanding -with the respective Governments outside the conference. We should have to take the lead and base our proposed action on the highest political groundsThen there is the question of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, which would lose its position as the principal Custodian Bank, which no doubt is a matter of great importance to it. Sir Charles Addis would therefore have to be consulted and taken into our confidence.Finally, there is the position of Sir Francis Aglen, Inspector-General of Customs, which, in view of his unwise connection with the internal loans, would become untenable. His tenure of office is in any case soon coming to an end, so that the only question of importance which arises is that of the appointment of a suitable successor.The arguments for withdrawal from the 1912 agreement may, therefore, be summarised as follows : (i.) That it would enable Great Britain to take the lead in a moral issue, (ii.) That it would be interpreted ar a liberal gesture: and without, in itself, derogating from the treaty rif ts of the Powers, would recognise China&apos;s
right to control her own revenues: foreign control over the whole customs revenues is unnecessary for the protection of the foreign bondholder and, therefore, the use of force to maintain that control is unjustified.(iii.) That it would reverse a long-standing policy of foreign interference in Chinese domestic affairs (quite outside the scope of the so-called &quot; unequal &quot; treaties), which is largely responsible for some of the present troubles in China, more especially the ruinous boycott of Hong Kong.(iv.) That, for the above reasons, it may help to end the boycott, (v.) That it would promote the natural development of China on a federal basis&quot;by throwing upon the provinces the responsibility for financing and supporting the Central Government, thus relieving the Powers of a responsibility which they were unwise to assume.(vi.) That by placing the provinces in funds it would facilitate the abolitionof li-kin, except perhaps in the far hinterland (vii.) That it would avert the very grave dangers of applying the present policy of foreign control to the large new revenues, in view of the probable opposition thereto of both the Nationalists and the provinces, viz. : (a.) The destruction of the foreign-staffed Customs Administration (of inestimable benefit to the British trader) by overloading it with responsibilities (such, for example, as the service of the domestic loans), quiet alien to its original purpose.(b.) Consequent jeopardising of the service of the foreign-secured loans (which are our only purely financial interest in the customs revenues) as a result of securing the unpopular unsecured loans on the customs, thanks to foreign support.These are too heavy risks to run in the endeavour to obtain by means of foreign control (a) the abolition of li-kin, which is unlikely to be more than a paper abolition; and (b) the consolidation of the unsecured debts, which would be resented by the provinces and wipe the slate clean for a fresh orgy of borrowing by the Central Government.A decision in regard to such a radical departure from our past practice being a matter of the first political importance, clearly the first thing to do was to seek the advice of the British delegation to the Tariff Conference.The British delegation have criticised the proposal on two main grounds. The first of these is that the adoption of the new policy would be dangerous, and even if it were not dangerous, would be impracticable. The second is that the whole idea of the new policy is based on an exaggerated estimate of the dangers of the present position.To take first the dangers as seen by the delegation. The delegation have recently summarised their view as follows : &quot; To sum up the position as we see it. You are taking too long a yiew in disregarding the immediate consequences, which would, in our considered opinion, gravely prejudice the prospect of the ultimate restoration of unity on a federal or any other basis, and be dangerously destructive to the whole edifice of the Chinese Government&apos;s finance and to the Customs Administration, in both of which British interests in the Far East are so deeply concerned.&quot;In more detail. The delegation, while agreeing that the future development of China will probably be along federalist lines, strongly dissent from the proposal that the foreign Powers should disinterest themselves in the financial well-being of the Peking Government by placing the customs revenues at the mercy of the provinces. They consider, on the contrary, that the Powers should do all that they properly can to assist the Chinese to establish the authority of a representative Central Govern-ment. They regard the Customs Administration as the principal remaining prop of any Central Government, and, therefore, of Chinese unity, and as the chief bulwark against disintegration and Bolshevik influence. And they believe that any funda-mental modification of the present system of collection, custody and control of the customs revenues, under the supervision of the inspector-general, might very well lead to the complete break-up of China. Instead of tending to put an end to civil wars, such a policy would rather promote them by putting temptation in the way of the provinces, as well as encouraging the imposition of even more grievous internal taxes than those at present levied.
The following quotations from Sir R. Macleay&apos;s telegrams will make their position clear : &quot;So long as the present conditions of civil strife continue, there seem to me no grounds for the assumption that if China were encouraged to revert to the fiscal system in force before 1911, military leaders who happen to control a large treaty port would allow the customs revenues collected there to be distributed to any other province or part of it to come to the Central Govern-ment. The reversion to such an arrangement would render any systematised li-kin abolition much more difficult, if not impossible, and would encourage the interior provinces not in possession of a large treaty port to secure their share of taxation of foreign trade by levying all kinds of additional duties. Moreover, in some cases the authority controlling a treaty port may not be the same as that controlling a provincial capital; while the financial prizes offered by the possession of ports would be likely to promote civil wars and political disintegration.&apos; *&apos;&apos; If the Central Government is to be maintained at all, it must be able to count on fixed State revenues, and why should His Majesty&apos;s Government promote the process of disintegration by facilitating the seizure by the provinces of revenues which are definitely allocated to the State under the Constitution ? So far from saving the Customs Administration, I fear that the system you contemplate may well wreck it and destroy the only foundation on which some form of fiscal unity of China could be built. Moreover, if the customs revenues disappear as far as the Central Government are concerned, the salt and railway revenues could hardly be preserved and the whole structure of China&apos;s centralisation of finance would be dissolved with disastrous results to the very large British interests concerned.&quot;There remains the question of impracticability.The delegation consider the proposed policy impracticable because it would entirely break down the scheme which the conference has already begun to build up. Tariff autonomy has been promised on the understanding that li-kin will be abolished; the proceds of the interim surtaxes are to be applied to the payment of compensation for li-kin and to a scheme of debt consolidation. The majority of the Powers represented at the conference will only agree to the application of customs revenues to li-kin compensation provided that a scheme of debt consolidation is adopted. Under the proposed policy, however, the Powers, although they might secure a promise from China to put into operation schemes for li-kin abolition and debt consolidation, would surrender the guarantee they now possess, in the shape of control over customs revenues, for the execution of any such scheme; and, in fact, the proposal is that China should be left to abolish li-kin and consolidate her debts in whatever manner she pleases, and outside the conference. It is quite out of the question to expect such a proposal to be acceptable to the Powers, and in advocating it the British delegation would be a voice crying in the wilderness. And, in fact, they are already so far committed to the scheme outlined above that they would lay themselves open to a charge of bad faith in withdrawing from it now.The second main criticism of the delegation is that the Foreign Office proposal is inspired by and based upon an over-estimation of the dangers of maintaining the present system of control or something analogous to it.In the first place, the delegation point out that the Foreign Office have quite wrongly assumed that China, as a whole, strongly resents the present system on the ground that it works to the advantage of Peking alone, and to the detriment of the provinces. The truth is that the provinces, although they do not obey the Central Government recognise it as the seat of government and diplomatic capital, and as charged with the fulfilment of China&apos;s obligations to foreign Powers and their nationals; that they already enjoy too great, not too small, a proportion of the national revenues; that they show no present tendency to seize the customs revenues or to demand that they should be distributed in fact, they still recognise that customs revenues, as provided in the Constitution, belong to the central authority; that they would probably be satisfied with the proposed allocation of part of customs revenues in lieu of li-kin; that, far from objecting to a scheme of debt consolidation, they would be likely to welcome it, for the bonds would be largely held by Chinese themselves; and that the best Chinese opinion is not averse to the maintenance, of the present customs regime, which saves the revenues from seizure by militarists, and offers the only hope of a rehabilitation of China&apos;s credit, for without it no[14161] d
scheme. of debt consolidation would be practicable; and that even the. Nationalists have not yet attacked the existing arrangements for collecting customs revenues under foreign supervision.In the second place, the Foreign Office overrate the measure of foreign control of customs revenue likely to be secured through the conference. Existing foreign control may be analysed as follows : (a.) Foreign assistance in the collection of revenues, involving handling of actual funds by the customs. There is no demand for the termination of this (i.e, reversion to the status quo ante 1911), which would mean, under existing conditions in China, the dissolution of Chinese Government revenue and wholesale repudiation of the national debt.(&amp;.) Foreign custodianship of revenues, namely, lodging of customs funds in foreign banks beyond the reach of the militarists. There is a demand for participation by Chinese banks in the custody of these funds a demand which is reasonable and which can easily be met.(c.) Foreign control over the allocation of the surplus of the customs revenues after foreign obligations have been met. This is almost entirely fictitious, as the whole surplus is administered by the Inspector-General of Customs, as the servant of the Chinese Government, for the service of the domestic debt. There is some criticism even of this arrangement in China, and it might be met by entrusting the administration of the new revenue not solely to the inspector-general, but to a Chinese commission.For all the above reasons, the British delegation think it safer and more practicable to follow, so far as possible, the general lines laid down in their instruc-tions which were issued before the situation (as the Foreign Office see it) was changed by the consent of the Powers to the resumption of tariff autonomy as from the 1st January, 1929, rather than to embark upon a new course in present critical conditions in China.What the British delegation hope to secure by following these lines is (1) to preserve intact the essential features of the Customs Administration, and (2) to obtain under the supervision of that administration, and thanks to its stabilising influence., a workable scheme for li-kin abolition and for the consolidation of unsecured debts which will be acceptable alike to the Central Government, to China as a whole thai, is to say, to the merchants, to the moderate Nationalists and to the provincial authorities and last, but not least, to all the foreign Powers and their nationals.The following extract from one of Sir R. Macleay&apos;s latest telegrams shows how the delegation hopes to attain this object: &apos;&apos; You asked for an alternative policy, and we suggest that this may be found on the line of insisting, as far as may be possible, upon provincial endorsement of any arrangements made by the conference, and of avoiding undue commit-ments in regard to the custody of the surtax revenues for li-kin abolition and other purposes, including debt consolidation. We may then be able, if the dangers you anticipate materialise later on, to dissociate ourselves from assisting the Central Government in the collection of surplus revenue in the face of pro-vincial opposition and, if necessary, endeavour to bargain with the provinces for the service of debt charges. We do not consider that anything is to be gained by trying to work out the details of such a policy now .... and we would urge that we should rather wait and see how the conference develops, bearing the principles of your ideas in mind. We have ourselves been at work for some time on a concrete plan, which we shall shortly lay before other delegations, for levying a li-kin compensation tax at the rate of one-third of the import duty, the proceeds of which will be controlled by a Chinese Li-kin Compensation Fund Committee, with fullest provincial representation, and distributed by the latter to the provinces, who would thus receive one-quarter of the total proceeds of the taxes collected by the customs from foreign trade, whatever they might amountto.....When negotiations are resumed, we will keep the question of the ways and means of securing provincial acceptance of the proposed arrangements constantly in the foreground.&quot;&quot; As regards Canton&apos;s attitude towards the conference negotiations, His Majesty&apos;s consul-general is of the opinion that the local authorities will continue to respect existing foreign loan charges, but will insist on receiving the proceeds of any tariff increases.....We think that the conference proposals shouldbe put before Canton as before other semi-independent provincial authorities, and if the majority of the provinces come in and Canton refuse to do so, we
may then have to consider whether it may not be feasible either to ignore or to make separate arrangements for Canton administration if such arrangements can be effected without unduly embarrassing ourselves elsewhere in China. It is unlikely, however, that Canton would wish to be differentiated permanently from the rest of China, so that any proposal for their exclusion should be only a temporary arrangement.&quot;It is clear, therefore, that the British delegation prefer to proceed by means of trial and error rather than by taking what they consider to be a leap in the dark.They agree, however, that the control of the Diplomatic Body over the release to the Chinese Government of free revenues from the customs surplus is anomalous and objectionable, even though it is now largely fictitious, and that the whole position ought to be reviewed at the conference. They have also suggested that as an alternative to consenting to the participation of Chinese banks in the custodianship of the customs revenues as a whole the Powers might consider the possibility of divesting themselves and foreign banks of all custodianship responsibilities in connection with the internal debt, and that foreign custody of customs revenues might be confined strictly to funds required for the service of the old foreign secured debt and of the foreign part of the proposed new consolidated (hitherto unsecured) debt. This, however, is the limit of the concessions which they have so far found themselves in a position to recommend.There are many statements in the above exposition of the case which are open to argument, as a perusal of the earlier part of this memorandum will have shown. The principal criticism, however, which the Foreign Office have to make against the alternative policy suggested by the delegation is that it takes too little account of the situation at Canton, the solution of which appears to the Foreign Office to be of vital importance. The British delegation admit that Canton presents a serious obstacle to the success of their scheme, but they have not, in the view of the Foreign Office, suggested any satisfactory method of overcoming the difficulty.They appear to regard Canton as a separate problem to be solved, if at all, by its own special remedy, and that it lies outside the purview of the Tariff Conference which is powerless to ameliorate it. The Foreign Office, on the other hand, are inclined to consider that the Canton problem is merely an extreme example of and similar in origin to the problem of China as a whole, and that the remedy must be one which goes to the root of the Chinese problem itself. It is this idea that has chiefly inspired the formulation of the new policy which it has been the purpose of.the present memorandum to describe.The urgency and immediate importance of the issue lies in this, that the Powers may at any moment be faced with a threat by Canton or some other provincial authority ito seize the customs revenues. They will be called upon to decide, at short notice, whether or not they are to follow the precedent of the past, and preserve the revenues for the Central Government by naval demonstrations. This course of action it is technically possible to defend as arising out of the trusteeship of the whole customs revenues conferred on the Diplomatic Body under the 1912 agreement. Such a defence has been set up in the past, and has only served to infuriate Canton against the foreign Powers. But the policy of naval demonstrations is morally indefensible in that it would be adopted to achieve an object that was never contemplated when the agreement was made, namely, the preservation, for the use of the Central Government alone, of revenues left over after all foreign obligations secured on the customs had been met. It would be politically disastrous in the present excitable state of China, and it would probably be impracticable, in that some Power, notably America, might refuse to participate. The only course would therefore be to stand idly by while revenues were seized, and to lose prestige through inability to meet the threat. It is for consideration whether the Powers should not take steps without delay to prevent their being placed in such an embarrassing position before the face of all China; and it is thought that a possible way to do so would be for them to divest themselves, before it is too late, of responsibilities which they have improperly assumed, and which they can no longer effectively sustain.It is only necessary to add that the Foreign Office proposal is only a tentative one and that its acceptance has not been pressed upon the British delegation. All that has been done for the present is to explore the ground and to ensure that the proposal, whatever it may be worth, is fully considered in all its aspects.V.

The employment of foreigners in the administration dates from the year 1855. The native officials of those days experienced considerable difficulties in collecting duties from foreign merchants, and these difficulties were greatly enhanced by the Taiping Rebellion then raging. Foreign &quot;inspectors&quot; were first employed at Shanghai, and the system was so successful that it was quickly extended to other ports. Mr. (afterwards Sir Robert) Hart became Inspector-General in 1865 and was succeeded on his death in 1911 by the present Inspector-General, Sir Francis Aglen. The administration collects the import and export duties, the coast trade duties, transit duties, tonnage dues on foreign shipping, and is also charged with the lighting and buoying of China&apos;s coast, harbours and navigable rivers. It is an international service, but about half the staff are British. It is pre-eminently a British institution; English is the official language and the administration is moulded on British lines.The maintenance of the Maritime Customs Administration intact has always been regarded as a vital Blritish interest. The administration was built up by the genius of a great Englishman the late Sir Robert Hart-who controlled its destinies for over forty years and saw it grow from small beginnings to a great service employing some 1,400 foreigners and over 6,000 Chinese. It has conferred immense benefits both upon China and upon the foreign merchants who trade with her, and both Chinese and foreigners of all nationalities are unstinted in their praise and admiration. The value to our prestige of this great monument to British probity and British efficiency can hardly be exaggerated.
To the British merchant it is also vital that the Customs Administration should continue to be in essence a British institution, thus ensuring him fair and impartial treatment, not merely in the levy of duties, but in the application of the complicated rules governing trade in China. In the hands of any other nationals, e.g., Japanese, or Americans, this power might be used to drive British traders off the field. The total trade of the British Empire with China in 1923 was valued at  117 million (imports from China,  42 million; exports to China,  75 million).The efficient collection of her customs revenues has up to now been the mainstay of China&apos;s credit and the principal security of the foreign bondholder. The foreign loans secured upon the customs amount to  224 million. The original British share of these loans was  31 million, of which  21 million is still outstanding, demanding for amortisation and interest in 1926  1,325,000. The first loans secured upon customs revenues were contracted between 1894 and 1898 in consequence of the Japanese war. The foreign debt was greatly increased by the Boxer Indemnity imposed upon China in 1900. Up to 1894 only four-tenths of the customs revenues had been remitted to Peking, the remaining six-tenths being retained by the provinces, but by the end of the Manchu regime in 1911 the whole customs revenues were absorbed by the service of the debt. Owing to increase in trade and the remission of Thte Boxer Indemnity in 1917, considerable surpluses became available later on.The year 1911 marks a crucial epoch in the history of the Customs Administration. Up to 1911 the foreign Inspector-General of Customs merely controlled the machinery which collected the revenues, but did not actually handle any money. The duties were paid direct to the Chinese superintendent at each port, and the Chinese authorities made their own arrangements for remitting the revenues to the Central Government, for the custody of the funds and for the service of the loans secured upon those revenues. It is worthy of note that China never defaulted on her obligations and her credit always stood deservedly high.&quot;When the revolution broke out in 1911 there was not unnaturally a period of considerable confusion. Some officials remained loyal to the Manchus, some turned over to the revolutionaries and some ran away. The system of government broke down and for the first time default actually occurred.In order to save the customs revenues from falling into the hands of revolutionaries and perhaps diverted from the service of the foreign debt, Sir John Jordan effected an arrangement by which the customs duties at each port were paid to the foreign Commissioner of Customs and by him remitted to the account of the Inspector-General in certain foreign banks in Shanghai. This arrangement was embodied in the Custodian Bank Agreement of the 30th January, 1912.This agreement constituted the Diplomatic Body the trustees of the whole customs revenues to see that all foreign obligations secured thereon were duly met. It also effected a fundamental change in the character of the Customs Administration, which henceforth combined the dual functions of (1) an organ of the Chinese Government, and (2) the instrument through which the Diplomatic Body executed its trust.It is expected that the Tariff Conference will effect some change in the Custodian Bank Agreement.Foreign Office, February 2, 1926.Annex III.Washington Treaties.Of the treaties signed at the end of the Washington Conference (1921-22), the texts of the two which principally affect the position in China are given below. They are : 1. The Quadruple Treaty (or Four-Power Pact) between the United States of America, the British Empire, France and Japan, signed the 13th December, 1921; and2. The Nine-Power Treaty relating to principles and policies to be followed in matters concerning China between the United States of America, Belgium, the British Empire, China, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands and Portugal, signed the 6th February, 1922.
1. The Four-Power Treaty.By this treaty the contracting parties agreed to respect their rights in relation to their insular possessions and dominions in the region of the Pacific Ocean. Any controversies arising out of any specific question not satisfactorily settled by diplomacy are to be submitted for consideration to a joint conference; the contracting Powers are to communicate with one another in the event of aggressive action by any other Power threatening the said rights; the treaty is to be in force for ten years, and thereafter to continue in force subject to twelve months&apos; notice by any contracting party; upon ratification of the treaty (i.e., the 17th August, 1923) the Anglo-Japanese Alliance Agreement had to terminate. A subsequent treaty (the 6th February, 1922) defined the term &quot; insular possessions and insular dominions&quot; in its application to Japan so as not to include the main islands of Japan.2. The Nine-Power Treaty.The contracting Powers other than China agreed (1) to respect the sovereignty, the independence and the territorial and administrative integrity of China; (2) to provide the fullest and most unembarrassed opportunity to China to develop and maintain for herself an effective and stable government; (3) to use their influence for the purpose of effectually establishing and maintaining the principle of equal opportunity for the commerce and industry of all nations throughout the territory of China; (4) to refrain from taking advantage of conditions in China in order to i seek special rights or privileges which would abridge the rights of subjects or citizens of friendly States and from countenancing action inimical to the security of such States.They further agreed not to enter into any treaty or agreement contrary to these principles, and that in deference to the principle of the &apos;&apos; open door&apos;&apos; or equality of opportunity in China they would not seek nor support their nationals in seeking : (a) any arrangement which might purport to establish in favour their interests, any general superiority of rights with respect to commercial or economic development in any designated region of China; (b) any such monopoly or preference as would deprive nationals of any other Power of the right of undertaking any legitimate trade or industry in China, or of participating with the Chinese Government or with any local authority in any category of public enterprise which, by reason of its scope, duration or geographical extent, is calculated to frustrate the practical application of the principle of equal opportunity.Other articles of the treaty stipulate : (i) That there will be no attempt by the Powers concerned to create spheres of influence; (ii) that there will be no unfair discrimination on Chinese railways; (iii) that Chinese neutrality in future wars will be respected; (iv) that the Powers concerned will communicate frankly and freely between themselves in any future situation affecting the treaty; (v) that other Powers, having treaty relations with China, shall be invited to adhere to the treaty; (vi) that the treaty shall come into force on the deposit of ratifications [i.e., the 5th August, 1925).   No definite date is fixed for the duration of the treaty.Treaty between the United States of America, the British Empire, France and Japan relating to their Insular Possessions and Insular Dominions in the Pacific Ocean.

To respect the sovereignty, the independence,  and the territorial andadministrative integrity of China; 2. To provide the fullest and most unembarrassed opportunity to China todevelop and maintain for herself an effective and stable Government; 3.

To refrain from taking advantage of conditions in China in order to seekspecial rights or privileges which would abridge the rights of subjectsor citizens of friendly States, and from countenancing action inimicalto the security of such States.Article 2.The contracting Powers agree not to enter into any treaty, agreement, arrangement, or understanding, either with one another, or, individually or collectively, with any Power or Powers, which would infringe or impair the principles stated in article 1.Article 3.With a view to applying more effectually the principles of the open door or equality of opportunity in China for the trade and industry of all nations, the contracting Powers, other than China, agree that they will not seek, nor support their respective nationals in seeking &apos;(a.) Any arrangement which might purport to establish in favour of their interests any general superiority of rights with respect to commercial or economic development in any designated region of China.(&amp;.) Any such monopoly or preference as would deprive the nationals of any other Power of the right of undertaking any legitimate trade or industry in China, or of participating with the Chinese Government, or with any local authority, in any category of public enterprise, or which, by reason of its scope, duration or geographical extent is calculated to frustrate the . practical application of the principle of equal opportunity.It is understood that the foregoing stipulations of this article are not to be so construed as to prohibit the acquisition of such properties or rights as may be necessary to the conduct of a particular commercial, industrial, or financial under-taking or to the encouragement of invention and research.China undertakes to be guided by the principles stated in the foregoing stipula-tions of this article in dealing with applications for economic rights and privileges from Governments and nationals of all foreign countries, whether parties to the present treaty or not.Article 4.The contracting Powers agree not to support any agreements by their respective nationals with each other designed to create spheres of influence or to provide for the enjoyment of mutually exclusive opportunities in designated parts of Chinese territory.

(L.S.)Annex IV.Li-kin.Li-kin (literally :c contribution of one-thousandth&quot;) is a tax imposed upon goods in transit. It was first imposed in 1853, during the Taiping rebellion, upon goods in transit from one province to another or from one district to another in the same province, but even before the name li-kin had been invented the arbitrary imposition of transit taxes on goods was, from the earliest times, one of the main difficulties with which our merchants had to contend. After the Taiping rebellion these taxes became heavier and rapidly extended all over the country. The history of Anglo-Chinese relations over a great many years is largely a record of more or less vain efforts to induce the Chinese Government to levy such taxes on some regular and certain system, and equally vain efforts to bind the Chinese to their engagements. As Peking absorbed more and more of the provincial revenues a process which began with the Japanese war in 1894 and, later, as both Peking and the provinces spent more and more money on armaments (though it is fair to say that expenditure on legitimate objects, such as education, administration of justice, &amp;c, also greatly increased), the evil of li-kin became much more serious. Innumerable barriers sprang up all over the country on all trade routes, rivers, railways,^and around large towns. By treaty foreign goods imported and native goods destined for export could escape li-kin by taking out a transit pass on payment of 2\ per cent. But the Chinese displayed great ingenuity in inventing new names, such as destination tax, consumption tax, production tax, protection tax, &amp;c, and goods which escaped li-kin were subjected to these other levies, while, in recent years, the merchant has also been forced to submit to the arbitrary exactions of military commanders. More serious even than the amounts actually extorted were the delays and the uncertainty of this pernicious and wasteful system. The problem of li-kin must always be understood in this wider sense not merely li-kin, but the whole problem of internal taxation of trade..Our efforts have always been directed at securing the total abolition of such taxation, firstly, because the taxation of the native trade has a serious repercussion on the foreign trade, and, secondly, because, as long as li-kin barriers remain in existence, the foreign&apos; trade cannot escape the vexatious delays and squeezes which are the real evil of li-kin in its wider sense.No reliable statistics can be given with regard to li-kin because it is utterly impossible to tell how much is paid by the merchant, how much is squeezed by the barrier officials and how much reaches the Treasury. Methods differ from province to province and from district to district. One very common method is to form out a barrier or a number of barriers for a fixed monthly payment, and then raise a loan at ruinous rates of interest on this fixed payment.There is a strong and growing demand among the Chinese themselves for the abolition of li-kin, and this, indeed, is the most hopeful feature of the case for genuine abolition can only come from within. The Chinese delegates at the Tariff Conference estimate that if li-kin is abolished a sum of 90 million dollars a year will have to be found to compensate the provinces for the revenue so surrendered.Foreign Office, February&apos; 2, 1926:
Annex V. The Unsecured Debt.The unsecured debt, which looms so large in the present political situation, is a problem of the post-revolution period. The revolution of 1911 threw China&apos;s finances and the fiscal relations between Peking and the provinces into complete disorder. Nevertheless, so great was the confidence in China&apos;s innate honesty that there was a rush to finance the new Provisional Government. Sir John Jordan did his utmost to stem the tide, but the pressure from all quarters was too great ?nd loans poured in from all quarters. The Powers agreed to support Yuan Shih-kai  whose prestige was very high and finally, in 1913, an international loan of  25 million, known as the Reorganisation Loan, was floated to enable him to consolidate his position and to give the new Government in China a good start.For the time being this wiped the slate clean of all unsecured debts to date, but there is no doubt that it set a very bad example, for every transient Government that succeeded proceeded to pile up as much debt as possible in the short time at their disposal, the money for the most part being either embezzled or squandered in senseless civil wars. The lenders, who doubtless thought that the slate would one day be wiped clean again, were of all nationalities : Chinese, Japanese, American, British and most of the races of Europe, but undoubtedly the Japanese were the worst offenders.The Japanese loans are composed principally of what are known as the Nishihara Loans. These were a series of loans amounting to 145 million yen spread over a period of about twelve months. They were made at the instigation of the Japanese Government under the premiership of Count Terauchi. They were camouflaged under various names, but were, in fact, part of a definite scheme of the Japanese Government to maintain the Central Government of China in a state of vassalage to Japan.The fact that from 1917 onward very large surpluses from the customs revenues became available for the purposes of the Central Government seemed to accelerate rather than check the piling up of this debt. At the time of the &quot;Washington Conference in 1921, China&apos;s unsecured debt was estimated at 350 million dollars. In 1925, just before the meeting of the Tariff Conference, the estimate had risen to 600 millions. Two months after the conference opened it was discovered that the estimates of the debt had mounted to no less than 1,500,000,000 dollars. Part of this no doubt is compound interest added to capital, but it seems certain that the prospect of the slate being wiped clean again by the Tariff Conference has been too tempting a bait for financiers of the shadier sort.The British share of the unsecured debt, including debts for materials sripplied and insufficiently secured railway loans, amounts t,n 72 million dollars, that is to say, about one-twentieth of the whole.Foreign Office, February 2, 1926.
