Memorandtun by the ^Secretary of State for Scotland.The legality of the relief which parish Councils have given to the dependants of miners, in accordance with the recommendations con-tained in a circular issued on 8th May last by the Scottish    Board of Health on the instructions of the Government,  is being challenged in the Court of Session.      Three actions of interdict in which this issue is raised are at present pending and a decision is expected at a com-paratively earljr date.        If the Court decide that the relief is illegal, as seems not improbable, an awkward situation will emerge and the Government will require to take immediate action to remedy it. It seems expedient, therefore, at this stage,  to anticipate events by considering the lines of the necessary legislation in order that the Bill may be ready for introduction whenever the Court decision (assuming-ing it to be adverse) is issued,Before discussing the lines of the proposed   Bill, I should per-haps remind my colleagues that, in August last, when the   Scottish Banks raised difficulties about financing Parish Councils,, the Board of Health were authorised by the Prime Minister to say confidentially to the Banks that if they would continue to advance money to    Parish Councils and an adverse decision were given by the Court, the    Govern-ment would introduce legislation regularising the relief paid prior to the decision.      The Banks did not agree to carry on and since then the Parish Councils have mostly been financed by loans advanced by the Goschen Committee.      Accordingly,. so far as the Banks are concerned the Government might be regarded as being released from their promise of legislation.      The matter must, however, be considered from the wider standpoint of the Parish Councils who, in paying the relief, have been acting in accordance with the directions and advice of the
Government, in some cases unv;illingly8     Tlielr expenditure on such relief up to the present date is approximately  550,000, and in the event of its being declared illegal it would be impossible either to surcharge the individual councillors or to recover from the ratepapers the assessments imposed to meet the expenditure.No actual promise of legislation has been communicated to any Parish Council but,  in cases where a Council was unwilling to carry on without some promise of indemnification,  the Board of Health, with the concurrence of the Treasury after consultation with the Prime Minister,  have informed the Councils concerned that &quot;in the event of the Courts holding payment made for the relief of the destitute dependants of miners to be illegal,  the Government will be prepared to take such action as is necessary to protect the position of Parish Councils who have acted in accordance with the recommendations in the Board&apos;s circular of 8th May last&quot;0     That undertaking,  in effect, means either legislation or recoupment of expenditure by means of a Government Grant,      The latter, which is probably what the Parish Councils would wish, may be ruled out in view of the financial position of the country and accordingly indemnifying legislation is the only practical course to be followed.It seems to me that, under the Bill in question, it -/ill not be enough merely to legalise expenditure up to the date of the Court decision because,  if the dispute were not terminated by that date:, the decision would presumably be followed by an immediate stoppage of relief and this would give rise to trouble Inasmuch as dependants of miners in Scotland would then be put in a worse position than sttch dependants would be in England; k similar difficulty would arise if the relief were legalised up to the date of the passing of the Act and the dispute were still continuing.. Moreover, even after the
termination of the present dispute,  relief to tiie dependants of strikers could &quot;be legally given in ling I and in terms of thedecision in the Mertkyr -?ydfil case.    Accordingly it appearsto mo to be advisable to legalise not only the relief thatlias been or nav be given in the nre sent dis jute but also tomalce some similar provision for tiie future - such provision,:as will &quot;be explained &quot;below,  to obtain for a limited period only.      Without some provision of that kind it will bo difficult to defend, the lav/ of Scotland on the point being allowed to remain different from that of England,  especially as the genera,! policy in recent years has been in the direction of assimilating the poor laws of the two countries so far at least as these deal with relief on account of unemployment and of trade disputes which may affect workmen in both countries.The question of what permanent provision,  if any,  is to be made for relieving the dependants of strikers will,  I presume, have to be decided for pugland as well as Scotland in the light of the experience gained during the present dispute and in the circumstances it seems undesirable in the Emergency Bill now proposed,  to continue legal sanction for such relief indefinitely or even for a, prolonged period.    I propose, therefore,  that the power to grant the relief should be exercisable only until 15th May,  1927,  that date being selected, because it is the date of expiry of the Poor Law Emergency Provisions (Scotland) Act,  1921, under whioh relief is granted, to the able-bodied unemployed.    If the Government, bv that date are  in a position to determine what their policy is to be with respect to the dependants of strikers,  effect could be given thereto by amending legislation.      Put if this should prove impracticable within the time available,   the powers conferred by the proposed Bill could bo continued for a further definite period.      It soems certain that the Act of 1921 will have to be continued beyond /
beyond 15th May, 1927, and accordingly the Bill dealing with this  could conveniently also deal with the continuance of the powers referred to - both being emergency measures.While the provisions outlined above will ensure that the wives and children of strikers shall not be allowed to suffer undue hardship involving injury to health,  it will,   I think, be necessary to meet the  criticism of those who object to the principle of the ratepayers being made to bear the burden of supporting the dependants of men who voluntarily abstain from work.    I would propose, therefore, that all relief given under the Bill should be recoverable from the men themselves as an alimentary debt.    The rates would thus be applied in the first instance to meet the needs of the dependants of the  strikers but the latter would be required tc refund the expenditure later on.      Such a course would be analagous to what obtained in Scotland in the days when the striker was financed very largely through his trade union funds and had to replenish them out of his own pocket when the strike was over.It may be -observed that the provision requiring relief in all cases  to be given on loan is slightly more stringent than the corresponding provision in the English Boor Lav/ Acts under which Beards of Guardians have a discretion as to whether the relief given by them is to be by way of loan or not.    On the other hand that discretionary power extends to all forms of  relief in England whereas in Scotland it would be limited to relief of a particular class, vis. the dependants of strikers,  there being no power to give relief on loan   under any of the present Scottish Poor Lav/ Acts.While no doubt the proposal I a/a making would meet with strenuous opposition from the Socialist Party, any less stringent provision giving the Parish Councils a discretion
would bs no less  strenuously opposed.    On the other hand, the proposed provision would have the advantage that, being clearly an emergency pr ovisi on, it would not appear to imply that the present English position was to be perpetuated. In the event of the  opposition to such a provision being strong enough to imperil the passage of the Bill,  it would be possible to bring pressure on the opposition by threaten-ing to confine  the Bill to the legalising of past expendi-ture and to withdraw all provision for  the future.    Another advantage of not allowing the  relief to be given on loan at discretion would be that we should secure greater uni-formity in administration.,    Parish Councils  are more numerous  than Boards  of Guardians and operate in smaller areas.    It might-we 11 be,  therefore, that relief in one small area would be  given on loan v/hile in the. adjacent area it might be given as a gift whic h v/ould clearly be most un-desirableo    Even though the loans may only be partially re-covered it is believed that the effect of receiving relief on an undertaking to repay would deter many-persons from applying.I also propose that  the relief should as far as possible be given otherwise than in cash.In the event,   therefore,  of an adverse decision being-given by the Court,  I would ask., my colleagues  to essunt to my introducing a Bill giving effect to the above proposals.A draft of the proposed Bill is attached.
