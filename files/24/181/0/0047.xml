fThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1926.Copy No.    43CABINET.IMPERIAL CONFERENCE,.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues an extract from the Commonwealth Parliamentary Debates of the 3rd August, 1926, containing a speech by the Common-wealth Prime Minister (the Right Ilonourable S. M. Bruce) on the subject of the Agenda for the forthcoming Imperial Conference. A copy of a despatch (signed by Lord Somers, as Deputy of the Governor-General) giving a summary of Mr. Bruce&apos;s speech and of the debate which followed is also circulated.I would invite particular attention to the passage marked on page 6 of Mr. Bruce&apos;s speech, which in substance applies to the history of the Locarno negotia-tions, the principle which it has been suggested should be adopted for guidance by the representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government at the forthcoming Conference (see Conference paper E (B) 13a) .I would also invite reference to the passages marked on pp. 11 and 12 as to the question of an Australian contribution to the cost of the Singapore Base. Judging from these remarks, it looks as though Mr. Bruce would be prepared to offer some contribution, but not a large one.L. S. A.Dominions Office, October 14, 1926.Extract from Commonwealth Parliamentary Debates, August 3, 1926.Speech by the Prime Minister.Mr. BRUCE (Flinders Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) 3-38]. I lay on the table of the House the agenda-paper for the Imperial Conference &apos;or 1926, and move -&quot; That the paper be printed.&quot;In submitting this motion, I desire to deal with some of the major matters that will be considered at the conference, in order to set out the views of the Government con-cerning them, and to afford to honourable members an opportunity of expressing their opinions upon them. The number of subjects on the agenda list is limited, but they cover most of the pressing matters now requiring consideration by the Govern-ment of Great Britain and those of the various self-governing dominions.The forthcoming conference is probably one of the most important in the history of the British Empire. Every thinking man must realise that to-day we have come to a turning-point in the relations of the different self-governing parts of the Empire and Great Britain, regarding Empire defence and the economic policy of the Empire. I propose to deal with these three questions in broad outline, and not to speak at any length on the minor questions which appear on the agenda-paper.In considering inter-imperial relations, it is, I think, necessary to examine the history of the British Empire to ascertain how the present position has arisen, and why we have an Empire composed of a number of self-governing dominions, and, to all intents and purposes, of independent peoples. It is, however, essential to remember that the British peoples form one great nation. It is a result of the pioneering and colonising genius of the British race that its nationals are scattered over the face of the globe, and have evolved a system of government inside the Empire under which they are free and independent and able to conduct their own affairs according to their own ideas. The history of the British Empire is one of gradual and progressive evolution, by which what were once Crown colonies have become the [15173] bSECRET.CP. 347 (26.)
self-governing dominions of to-day. Australia and the other self-governing dominions are unfettered and untrammelled, and can express their views as independent communities Prior to the world war, the great dominions had readied virtually, an independent status, with full self-governing rights, controlling their own affairs and carrying out their own destinies. But we allowed our foreign policy to be entirely formulated and controlled by British statesmen, acting on behalf of the Empire as a whole. Obligations in respect of foreign policy were then seldom in the mincls of those in control of dominion affairs. With the coming of the war there emerged a new realisation of the obligations of the dominions as part of the Empire, and of the necessity for the dominions to be consulted with regard to, and to have a voice in the framing of, the foreign policy of the Empire from which those obligations arose. When we became engaged in a life-and-death struggle which exacted our maximum effort, we realised that we could no longer leave questions of foreign policy entirely in the hands of others. We could never again allow ourselves to be placed in a position in which we might be involved in war without having been consulted, or having been put in possession of information as to the cause of the conflict! Britain&apos;s participation in the recent war arose out of her guarantee of the integrity of Belgium, but there were few persons in Australia who were aware that Britain was a party to such a treaty and that we, as a part of the Empire, were concerned in it. The war made it necessary for the self-governing dominions to consider their position, and many changes were made which have affected their relations with each other, and, in particular, with Great Britain. During the war an Imperial War Cabinet was established; but no thinking man would suggest that such a body could be of use except in a time of dire national crisis. It would not be acceptable in times of peace; the self-governing parts of the Empire would not tolerate an Imperial Cabinet, whose existence must diminish the rights and privileges which they now enjoy under their own Constitutions. The Treaty of Versailles was separately signed on behalf of Great Britain, of the self-governing dominions, and of India; there is a separate membership of the different parts of the Empire of the League of Nations; and the right of diplomatic representation of the self-governing parts of the Empire in foreign countries, in relation to those matters with which they are particularly concerned, has been recognised. Further, a resolution passed at the Imperial Con-ference of 1923 recognised the right of the self-governing parts of the Empire to negotiate separate treaties. All these things have been done in recognition of the full partnership of the peoples which constitute the British Empire, and are part of the beneficent evolution which has resulted from the genius for self-government possessed by those of British stock. The stage that has now been reached in the position of the dominions may cause some confusion, but it is a recognition of the autonomy of the self-governing dominions within the Empire and of their growth, strength and importance; they are, too, fundamental constitutional alterations in the internal relations of the Empire. The confusion which has arisen has led to the demand, in some quarters, for a clear definition of the status of the dominions and of their relation to each other and to foreign countries. It is essential, therefore, that we should consider this new constitutional position, to see where it places us, but before doing so I stress the elemental fact that must always be remembered in this connec-tion, that the British people represent one nation, and not many nations, as some have endeavoured to suggest. A wonderful response was made by the far-flung dominions, colonies and protectorates of the Empire when the disastrous war broke out in 1914. It was clearly demonstrated then that, although people may, in times of peace, argue in an academic fashion about the unity of the Empire, in the face of a foreign foe the British peoples are solid and undivided. The war brought us closer together, and we fought as one entity to uphold the great principles in Avhich we believe. But, although the war showed the strength of our united Empire, it also revealed the weakness and limitations of its various parts as separate units; and it would be tragic if now, in this time of reconstruction, we should allow the Empire to disintegrate. Should that happen, we would lose all that we fought for in the war. The dismemberment of the British Empire would be tragic, not only for the integral parts of the Empire itself, but also for the world at large, for it would mean the dissolution of the greatest force now existing for the maintenance of peace. In these circumstances, it is undoubtedly necessary that we should do everything within our power to ensure the greatest possible measure of Imperial co-operation. We must exercise a sympathetic interest in, and seek to gain a sound understanding of, the aspirations and ideals of all parts of the Empire. The situation that confronts us in respect of this new doctrine of imperial relationship must be carefully considered
from three points of view. The dominions of the Empire are self-governing. That is the first fact to be remembered. We have complete independence and absolute authority with regard to our own domestic affairs. We are entirely untrammelled in the conduct of matters which affect Australia only. If a single thing that could be regarded as a real limitation of our autonomy could be pointed to, I have no hesitation whatever in saying that the Imperial Government would, if possible, remove it; but I know of nothing whatever that could be rightly considered a restric-tion of the authority of the Commonwealth Government to deal with Commonwealth affairs. The second fact that must be borne in mind is the status of the dominions in regard to imperial foreign policy. At present the fullest possible consideration is given by the Imperial Government to any views that the dominions may offer on matters of foreign policy. It has been unanimously affirmed by the representatives of the Empire that we have the right to negotiate with any foreign State on matters which affect us only, although there are some limitations to that power. It lias been laid down, for instance, that &quot; It is desirable that no treaty should be negotiated by any of the Govern-ments of the Empire without due consideration of its possible effect on other parts of the Empire, or, if circumstances so demand, on the Empire as a whole.&quot;Mr. Stewart : Does that apply to Great Britain as well as to Australia?Mr. BRUCE : Certainly. It is also provided that negotiations for a treaty which may affect more than one of the dominions shall be entered into only with the co-operation of all the dominions concerned. These, however, are the only limita-tions upon us. We have the right to appoint diplomatic agents and representatives in foreign countries to deal with matters that concern us exclusively. There would be no objection to Australia sending her diplomatic representatives all over the world, though it would be unwise for her to do that. Then, of course, although we have separate membership in the League of Nations, we are British nationals. It is of immeasurable advantage to our people when travelling broad to be able, as British citizens, to claim the protection and help of the British consular and diplomatic authorities in the countries they visit. The third point that we have to consider in relation to this new doctrine and really it is the only matter that needs much con-sideration from us is our position in the event of an outbreak of war. We must recognise that, in time of war, the British Empire is a single unit and we are British nationals. When the King is at war, every one of his subjects is also at war. It is of no use for us to shut our eyes to that fact. It is an inescapable position so long as the present constitutional position continues. Of course, it is open for the dominions to determine what,, if any, active participation they wall take in the conduct of hostilities, but; we cannot get away from the fact that, when war has been declared by the Imperial Government, all the parts of the Empire are at war.Whilst, to a great extent, the new doctrine that has been enunciated has been discussed merely in academic fashion, the remarks of certain Empire statesmen have given it a measure of endorsement which makes essential our careful examination of it. In brief, what has been suggested is that a declaration should be communicated to the world Powers asserting the international independence of the dominions, and claiming for them recognition as separate international units. Such a declaration could consistently be made to the nations of the world if, in fact, we were independent nations allied one with the other, but it is hopelessly irreconcilable with the idea of unity of the British Empire. We cannot think that any other nation would tolerate one group of its nationals declaring that, in the event of war breaking out, it had the&apos; right to direct its own affairs and intended to retain its neutrality and independence. In any other nation in the world, except this amazing British nation, such a thing would never be contemplated, because it would mean the breaking up of the nation. Will anyone maintain that, because the pioneering genius of its people have split up the British nation in a geographical sense, considerations which apply to other nations do not apply to it? Or is the preservation of genuine imperial unity com-patible with the possibility of one part of the Empire standing aside when the rest are engaged in a life-and-death struggle? And yet to-day that is almost being-suggested by one of the dominions.Mr. Stewart: What dominion has suggested that?Mr. BRUCE : I have no desire to refer specifically to any dominion, but as the honourable member has invited me to do so, my reference is to a recent utterance by the Prime Minister of South Africa.   Suppose, for example, that Great Britain was&quot;[15173] b 2
menaced. Will anyone suggest that Australia, as an integral part of the British Empire, could stand aside and see Britain destroyed Apart altogether- from sentimental reasons, self-interest would force us to do all that was possible to prevent the tragic disappearance of Britain as one of the Great Powers of the world, because the disintegration of the British Empire itself would be the result. This declaration to the world of the independence of the dominions would inevitably lead to the disintegration of the British Empire as it is understood to-day. Australia^ aspira-Lion must be a closer linking together of all the self-governing portions of the Empire, with as full a recognition of the independent status of all the self-governim-dominions as is compatible with the recognition of our mutual British nationality, and the maintenance of the closest possible relations between the English-speaking peoples. That, I believe, is the view which this community takes to-day. These considerations make it clear that there is a clean-cut issue to face. We have to say either that we believe in the British Empire, one and undivided; that we believe in the great British nationhood that we enjoy; or that we are indifferent to the breaking up of the Empire, as we consider ourself an independent people. Let as examine the latter contention, to see the results that would flow from our declaration of independence, if that declaration had official international recognition, with, perhaps, some personal link between the different dominions in the British Throne. In the first place, no foreign Power is likely to consent to a dominion &quot;having it both ways.&quot; We must be either inside or outside the Empire. Another thing we j should bear in mind is that our citizens would thus become possessed of a separate nationality, because common nationality is really the basis on which is determined, in the case of war, what peoples are at war with each other. We cannot enjoy the privileges of nationhood as part of the British Empire without accepting the obligations. If we became independent we should have to provide for the protection of our citizens the world over, to set up diplomatic and consular services, and conduct our own foreign relations. It might be argued that Great Britain could conduct our foreign relations for us; but surely the conduct of its relations with other countries is the prerogative of an independent nation. If, after having claimed independence, our foreign relations were conducted by Great Britain, we should be in the position of a protectorate. Again, we should be responsible for our own treaties with foreign States, and be subject to the ordinary measures of constraint in the event of any failure to observe them. As an independent people we could look for no outside assistance if we became involved in trouble with another nation. It would be possible, of course, to make reciprocal treaties with other countries that are to-day inside the British Empire; but, unless those treaties provided for our promising something of a tangible nature in exchange for any assistance that might be received, we should be in the position of a country living under the protection of another country. Could we, as a proud and independent people, enter into any reciprocal arrangement without being prepared to give benefits equivalent to those which we might enjoy? It is obvious that we could not enter into such a one-sided arrangement as that. Lastly, we should have to provide for our defence. I have no desire to discuss this subject to-day. I simply reiterate my view, which is the view also of the Government, that our safety is ensured by &apos; the fact that we are part of the British Empire, and that our surest line of defence is co-operation with Great Britain. I suggest that it is impossible for us to escape our obligations whilst we remain inside the British Empire, and that it is impossible to make a declaration of independence. Therefore, we are forced back to the position that we are inside the British Empire, and that whilst we enjoy its privileges we must also accept its obligations. I have referred to the new status the dominions achieved by the war. With this new status there came a demand to be consulted with regard to the foreign policy of the Empire, and to have a voice in framing it. Consequently, our task now is to find the best possible method by which we can have a voice in the determination of the foreign policy of the British Empire. That is the policy out of which war may spring. We must adopt the means that are best calculated to ensure that proper regard will be paid to any view we may express regarding the lines which foreign policy should follow. What position do the dominions occupy at present in relation to foreign affairs ? At intervals, conferences of the various Prime Ministers are held in Great Britain. At those conferences the foreign policy of the British Empire is reviewed. In 1923, the question widen transcended all others in importance was the position in the Ruhr, and the attitude of France in relation to reparations. That conference had to consider what steps ought to be taken to solve a problem that was keeping the whole of Europe in a
ferment. A request for co-operation was sent to the United States of America, and, as a result, the Dawes and McKenna committees were appointed. The efforts of those committees considerably brightened the European outlook. At these conferences, the general line of foreign policy can be discussed, and laid down with a fair amount of exactitude. It is competent for this Parliament to indicate at the present jun6ture the lines which British foreign policy should follow. I, on behalf of Australia, can voice those wishes at the forthcoming conference. When the Prime Ministers return to their respective dominions, they are kept fully informed, by means of cables and despatches, of Britain&apos;s every act in relation to foreign affairs. That method of consultation can be made quite effective upon ordinary questions of foreign policy, enabling the different dominions to take a full part in matters of Empire concern. Great Britain has never objected to supplying any information that has been sought by a dominion. Every piece of information that is supplied to her Ambassadors the world over, and every despatch that is received by British Cabinet Ministers, as well as any important despatches that are sent to British representatives abroad are being forwarded to us at the present time, and that practice will be continued in the future. Any dominion Prime Minister who has the machinery necessary for handling those despatches and cables can make himself better informed upon current affairs than can a British Cabinet Minister, whose principal duty it is to administer his own department. Since this consultative system exists, and since we avail ourselves of it to our entire satisfaction, it follows that we should be prepared to endorse policies about which our advice has been asked, and which we have had a share in shaping. But if a sudden crisis should develop, and the entire outlook be changed rapidly and suddenly, our position must be an awkward one. So long as world circumstances remained normal, any line of policy which might have been laid down would probably be both admirable and effective. The Foreign Secretary is in the best position to sense impending changes in the world&apos;s circumstances, and when he finds that a new move must be made, he probably consults his Prime Minister. The Cabinet has not the matter before it until a decision must be made in regard to an alteration of foreign policy to bring it into accord with the different circumstances that have arisen. Then the dominions are at a disadvantage. It is true, of course, that the information which comes to us shows, to some extent, in what way a position may be changing, but the difficulty of coming to a common decision to meet the new position still exists. The only person through whom that decision can be conveyed is the representative of the dominion in London. The High Commissioner keeps closely in touch with&apos; members of the British Cabinet, and enjoys the confidence of the Foreign Secretary. He really occupies the position of an Ambassador. He is made acquainted with any changes that are occurring, and informs his Government accordingly. The whole question will have to be discussed at the forthcoming Imperial Conference. I repeat that Australia is within the Empire, and cannot get outside it unless we completely out ourselves adrift from our British nationhood and the privileges that we enjoy. As a part of the Empire, we have certain obligations. Our principal task is to create the machinery that will enable us to have a real voice in the foreign policy of the Empire.Mr. Mann : Do not the daily advices prepare the mind for the crisis that follows ?Mr. BRUCE : We are advised generally in relation to actual events; but there are other changes which take place almost imperceptibly. The Foreign Secretary may have an impresion of what is&quot; occurring, but such impressions cannot be adequately embodied in a despatch or a cable. They may not even be positive impressions. Information can be cabled or despatched only when the matter has reached the stage when a decision is unavoidable. That difficulty must be overcome by different methods of communication, which will have better results than can be achieved at present. The point I wish to stress is that any dominion which so desires can create the machinery that will enable it to be kept fully informed upon matters of foreign policy. It is an obligation upon every dominion to do that. Our present difficulty can be best visualised by considering a specific case. I take the case of the Locarno Treaty, because it will be necessary for this House to express an opinion upon it.Prior to the completion of the Treaty of Locarno, and its subsequent signature in Great Britain, long and protracted negotiations took place between the powers concerned.    This Government was kept fully informed of those negotiations.
Cablegrams and other communications stating exactly how the situation was developing were sent to us daily, and it was open to us at any time to cable back our dissent from the action contemplated by Great Britain, and to indicate our views on the subject. We did not express our dissent, for we believed that the proposed Treaty of Mutual Guarantee would have the effect of stabilising the conditions in Europe, and would be a factor in promoting the workTs peace. We were fully informed of all negotiations. There are three aspects from which this House should consider the Treaty; first, whether it will tend to the promotion of world&apos;s peace; secondly, whether its operation will be complementary of, or in opposition to, the Covenant of the League of Nations; and thirdly, what are our obligations under it.   It is necessary, therefore, to explain the Treaty itself.The Treaty of Mutual Guarantee was drawn up and initialed at Locarno on the 16th October last, and was formally signed in London on the 1st December. The parties to it are Great Britain, France, Germany, Belgium and Italy. Its object is to establish security in Western Europe, a region which has been the scene of devastating conflicts, into which Great Britain, because of her geographical position, has almost inevitably been drawn for the protection of vital interests, and even of her existence. The five Powers concerned have shown a desire to break with the unhappy past, and to co-operate for the prevention of war between them. The Treaty contains two different sets of obligations. The first of these applies only to France, Germany and Belgium. Those States agree not to go to war with each other, and to submit all disputes between them to peaceful settlement. Disputes between Great Britain and the other signatory States will, of course, be governed by the Covenant of the League of Nations. The second set of obligations covers the guarantee, and applies to all the five signatory States, which pledge themselves collectively and severally to guarantee the maintenance of the territorial status quo resulting from the frontiers between Germany and Belgium and Germany and France, as fixed by the Treaty of Versailles.Mr. Hughes : Does the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee apply to Europe generally ?Mr. BRUCE: No; only to the western frontiers of the countries named, as laid down by the Treaty of Versailles. The Powers concerned also affirm the stipulations in articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles, concerning the demilitarised zone on the Rhine. This guarantee, therefore, aims at establishing, once and for all, the present frontiers of Western Europe and preventing any attempt in the future to modify them by force.Mr. Hughes : Does the Treaty include Czecho-Slovakia and Jugo-Slavia ?Mr. BRUCE : No; only Western Europe. In article 2 of the Treaty, Germany and France and Germany and Belgium undertake that in no case will they resort to war against each other. That undertaking does not deprive them of the right to act in legitimate self-defence in the event of any one of them proving unfaithful to its obligation, and attacking the other; nor does it apply;to any action that may be taken under article 16 of the Covenant of the League dealing with sanctions. Article 3 of the Treaty lays down the general conditions under which disputes between Germany, France and Belgium are to be settled. These countries undertake to settle, by peaceful means, every dispute which may arise between them. Arbitra-tion is compulsory when the parties disagree about their respective rights, and they pledge themselves to comply with any arbitral decision that is given. Political disputes are to be submitted to a conciliation commission. If, in the event of any dispute, no settlement acceptable to the parties concerned is arrived at, it must be submitted to the Council of the League, according to article 15 of the Covenant, and the League itself will then decide the matter. I would point out that the Treaty is in no sense antagonistic to the League. A result of the Treaty will also be that if the Council does not arrive at a unanimous decision under article 15, the parties are pledged not to resort to war. Articles 4 and 5 of the Treaty set out the guarantee given by Great Britain, which really operates on behalf of all the parties to it. The guarantee will operate in favour of Germany, France or Belgium, according to which country is the victim of aggression by one of the others. The guarantee will operate should one of these three countries resort to war against another without submitting the dispute to peaceful settlement. The League will play an important part in this guarantee. When a party alleges a breach of the Treaty, it must at once bring the matter before the Council of the League, which, when it has satisfied itself that a breach has been committed, will call on the guarantor Powers to assist immediately the country against which the act of aggression has been directed.
Mr. Charlton : The guarantors are Great Britain and Italy?Mr. BRUCE : Yes; they are the two guarantors. There is also a provision that in the event of delay on the part of the Council in completing its investigations, and immediate action and defence being considered necessary, it can be taken in the case of a flagrant and unprovoked aggression, and the guarantors have agreed to take it. The Council of the League must, however, continue its investigations and issue its findings to the parties to the Treaty, which undertake to act in accord-ance with those findings. These findings must be concurred in by all the members of the Council other than the representatives of the parties which have already engaged in hostilities. It is stipulated that the Treaty does not affect the rights and obligations of the parties under the Treaty of Versailles and the London Reparation agreements of the 30th August, 1924. But it seems to me impossible to escape from the conclusion that when the Locarno Treaty comes into force any dispute between France, Belgium and Germany, concerning the respective rights of these countries under the Peace Treaty, must be submitted to arbitration. The Treaty will come into force only when Germany becomes a member of the League of Nations. No definite duration is fixed to the Treaty. It is stipulated that when the Council, acting at the request of one or other of the contracting parties, decides by a two-thirds majority that the League of Nations affords sufficient security, the Treaty will terminate one year after such decision is reached. There are certain other features of the Treaty to which I need not refer. Honourable members have received copies of it, and can read it for themselves. The other provisions practically set out the machinery showing how and when action under it may take place. The broad lines of the Treaty are that Germany, France and Belgium undertake that any dispute between them shall be settled by arbitration, and that they will not go to war. Italy and Great Britain are under the Treaty the guarantors for the fulfilment of the obligations which the other three Powers have undertaken.Mr. Watt : Must the guarantor Powers await a summons from the League of Nations before they can intervene ?Mr. BRUCE : They can intervene, and, in fact, undertake to intervene in the case of flagrant and unprovoked attack by one of the Powers upon the other.Mr. Charlton : Without a request from the League? Mr. BRUCE : Yes.Mr. Hughes : That would not apply to an unprovoked attack by Germany on French colonies.Mr. BRUCE : Both Germany and France give a solemn undertaking not to resort to war in any circumstances against each other.Mr. Hughes : The unprovoked attack which would justify interference by the guarantors would be one upon the western frontiers as laid down by the Treaty of Versailles.Mr. BRUCE .   Yes, the Treaty deals with that region entirely.A matter deserving of consideration is the relation of the Treaty to the League of Nations, and I think that a close examination of it will show that it in no way conflicts with the principles and spirit of the Covenant of the League, but is really complementary to it. There is nothing in the Covenant of the League of Nations which debars a group of nations, should they feel that possible contingencies are not adequately met by the provisions of the Covenant, from coming to some agreement amongst themselves for their mutual protection and the maintenance of peace. This is specifically provided for in Article 21 of the Covenant. In fact, the League has always contemplated the making of regional agreements between nations which will help &quot;to ensure worlds peace, and the Covenant provides that all those agreements must be registered with the League, so that their terms may be known to the whole world. The original copy of this Treaty was deposited with the League by its presentation to the Council on the 14th December, and really has now the endorse-ment of the League. There is nothing in it which can be suggested as conflicting with the ideals underlying the Covenant of the League. The Washington Conference and the Reparations Conference held in London in 1924 were entirely in accordance with the principles and ideals of the Covenant, and so also is this Treaty.Mr. Charlton : Germany was to become a member of the League.
Mr. BRUCE : The Treaty is in part the outcome of the co-operation of four nations that are already members of the League Great Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium. I have said that it contemplates as a circumstance which must take place before it comes into operation that Germany shall also enter the League.Mr. Scullin : In what way does it differ from the grouping of nations prior to the war ?Mr. BRUCE : There was no registration of arrangements entered into in the grouping of nations prior to the war, and such arrangements were in many instances made for purposes of offence. This Treaty is entered into for the purpose of ensuring that disputes between the nations concerned shall be referred to arbitration. It is really an arbitration treaty, as affecting Fance, Belgium, and Germany, the two other nations coming in as guarantors of the observance of the obligation to proceed to arbitration.   That is very different from what happened prior to the war.Another phase of the question is Australia^ position as affected by the Treaty. Article 9 of the Treaty provides that-&apos;*&apos; The present Treaty shall impose no obligation upon any of the British dominions, or upon India, unless the Government of such dominion, or of India, signifies its acceptance thereof.&quot;The self-governing dominions have two alternatives. They can accede to the Treaty or refuse to have anything to do with it. There are certain facts which it is necessary to bear in mind in considering this matter. Great Britain&apos;s obligation, of course, arises out of her guarantee. Should Great Britain ever be called upon to give effect to the guarantee she has given, it would be only in a case of flagrant aggression by Germany against France and Belgium, or by France and Belgium against Germany. Such an act of aggression would set aflame again the whole of the west of Europe, and very possibly the security and existence of Great Britain would be at stake in such a conflagration. We could not, in such circumstances, suggest that we would be neutral, and would play no part in the matter at all. We may remain aloof from the Treaty by our silence, and may decide to have nothing to do with it by express declaration.Mr. Watt :&apos; Is that a fact, in view of the attitude of the Government in endorsing the Treaty?Mr. BRUCE : The Government has not informed the British Government that it approves of the Treaty. On the other hand, it did not say that it was opposed to the Treaty when it was being negotiated. I think that was also the attitude taken up by the other dominions. While we may not have anything to do with the Treaty, b,T express declaration, we cannot escape from its consequences should the malice of circumstance bring it into operation, otherwise than by leaving the Empire and claiming to be an independent State. In the circumstances I have envisaged, we could not be indifferent to Great Britain&apos;s fate, because, apart from other considerations, our security and that of Great Britain are inseparably bound up each with the other.Mr. Charlton : Canada and South Africa do not adopt that attitude, nor have we ever done so before.Mr. Watt : That may make our position awkward; but it does not make it wrong.Mr. BRLCE : My understanding of the British commonwealth of nations is that it is governed by an unwritten treaty of mutual guarantee, and therein lies its strength.   The different parts of the Empire mutually guarantee one another.Mr. Charlton : The right honourable gentleman proposes to take away our option and make our guarantee compulsory.Mr. BRUCE : We have to consider what are the advantages m our maintaining silence in respect of this question, or in our frankly affirming and making it known beforehand that we intend to stay by Great Britain in the fulfilment of her guarantee.mr. Charlton : The right honourable gentleman had better wipe out the League of Nations altogether.   That is what he is coming to.Mr. BRUCE : I. think that the effect of the Treaty will be to strengthen the League. In the present position of our relationships with Great Britain, I think that silence on this matter cannot conceivably, in the final analysis, diminish our
obligations. There is the strongest ground for believing that if France and Germany knew beforehand that Great Britain would intervene in the case of an unprovoked war by one of those Powers against the other, neither would run the risk of attacking the other. If this be so, the result of the very existence of the Treaty must tend to minimise the possibility of its ever being brought into operation. - It will act as an effective deterrent to a prospective evil-doer who may be contemplating a criminal act of aggression. Chances of success have often stimulated countries to predatory acts. The prospect of failure in such ventures inspires caution and wisdom, if, when the great war broke out in 1914, it had been made clearly and definitely known that not merely Great Britain, but also the rest of the British Empire, might become involved, that would have had a deterrent effect upon the action then taken. A nation contemplating action in defiance of its obligations will be deterred by consideration of the strength of the forces by which it will be opposed.Mr. Watt : That was done under the Triple Alliance when the war broke out.Mr. Scullin : The war broke up the alliance.Mr. BRITCE : The question that arises is this : whether we do not in reality reduce our risks to the strictest minimum in openly saying that the whole force of the British Empire will be employed to guarantee peace. Would our obligations be increased in the long run by our adopting an attitude of non-co-operation with Britain on this matter ? That is a question upon which we must come to a decision. If the House believes that this Treaty of Mutual Guarantee that has been entered into is one which will tend to the stabilisation of Europe, and the promotion of world&apos;s peace, and having had an opportunity of expressing its views upon it, decides that it is a good one, it should declare its opinion about it.Mr. Charlton : In order that we may do so, does the right honourable gentle-man intend to submit a specific resolution ?Mr. BRUCE : It is for us to consider the course which we should pursue. I do not propose at present to submit any motion to the House either approving or disapproving of the ratification of the Treaty of Australia. This is a question of the position of the dominions in respect of obligations entered into by Great Britain, and, as such, will come up for consideration at the forthcoming Imperial Conference. The specific matter of the Locarno Treaty must come up for consideration at that conference. I think it desirable and essential that members of this House should express their opinions upon the Treaty, its effect upon the Empire and Australia, and upon Europe and the world&apos;s peace, and should indicate their view as to whether Australia should affirm or refuse to affirm it. But it is undesirable that a resolution should be submitted to this House on the question at the present time, because, as I have said, the matter is one which should be discussed at the Imperial Conference.Mr. Charlton: If we are not tied up by the action already taken by the Govern-ment.   [Extension of time granted.&apos;]Mr. BRUCE : At the Imperial Conference there should be the fullest oppor-tunity to consider the position of the dominions regarding all such treaties. If possible, all parts of the Empire should adopt the same attitude in regard to these matters.Mr. Charlton : The right honourable gentleman is not going to take it upon himself to commit Australia in this matter ?Mr. BRUCE : I give the House my assurance that 1 shall take no action at the Imperial Conference in regard to the ratification of the Treaty, until its ratifi-cation has been approved by this House.Mr. Hughes : The Treaty by which England and America guaranteed the safety of France was put before this Parliament and ratified by it; and this should be dealt with similarly.   We should say !t Yes &quot; or &quot; No &quot; to it.Mr. BRUCE : There should be the fullest discussion of the question at the Imperial Conference before any definite action is taken in the matter. At the present moment the whole question of the status of the dominions is under review. New theories have been advanced to which great importance is attached by some of the dominions. As I have already indicated, I do not subscribe to these, because I do not think they are tenable; but, at the same time, I consider that the fullest oppor-tunity should be afforded at the conference for the expression of these views, and[15173] c
that nothing should be done to prejudice that full discussion by any prior action on the part of a dominion. I think I have made it perfectly clear what my attitude will be. &quot;Mr. Coleman : Would the right honourable gentleman consider himself bound by any decision of the Imperial Conference ?Mr. BRUCE : No decision of the Imperial Conference is binding on any part of the Empire until it has been ratified by the legislature of that country.   On my return from this conference I shall submit to Parliament the resolutions agreed to leaving it to Parliament to ratify or reject them.At the last Imperial Conference, certain resolutions were passed concerning Empire defence, and I think, broadly, they represent views to which the people of Australia generally would subscribe.   The first resolution was &quot; 1 The conference affirms that it is necessary to provide for the adequate defence of the territories and trade of the several countries comprising the British Empire.&quot;I think that the people of Australia will subscribe enthusiastically to that particular resolution, because it is obvious that the Empire can only be held together so long as there is adequate defence of the territories and trade of the Empire as a whole. To the next resolution, which laid down the obligation of the individual parts of the Empire, every representative at the last conference subscribed. It is as follows : &quot; 2. In this connection, the conference expressly recognises that it is for the Parliaments of the several parts of the Empire, upon the recommendations of their respective Governments, to decide the nature and extent of any action which should be taken by them.&apos;&apos;That resolution provides for loyal and full co-operation within the Empire, but maintains for each separate self-governing part of the Empire the right to decide the magnitude of its own effort. In this connection the conference laid down certain guiding principles, the first of which was &quot; (a.) The primary responsibility of each portion of the Empire represented at the conference for its own local defence.&apos;&apos;Australia has shown that it recognises the primary obligation which rests upon it, not only to defend itself, but also to co-operate in the defence of trade routes, and, generally, in the defence of the Empire as a whole. In providing for its own defence, it has certainly done more than any other part of the Empire except Great Britain, as, presently, I shall show from certain figures bearing upon the effort made in various parts of the Empire.  A second guiding principle was &quot; (&amp;.) Adequate provision for safeguarding the maritime communicationsof the several parts of the Empire, and the routes and waterways along and through which their armed forces and trade pass.&apos;&apos;This, of course, has a peculiar interest for Australia, because we are living in one of the outposts of the Empire.   A third principle laid down was &quot; (c.) The provision of naval bases and facilities for repair and fuel so as to ensure the mobility of the fleets.&quot;Owing to our geographical position and our expressed opinion that the principal defence of Australia, and, indeed, of the Empire itself, is on the sea, we approved of the provision of the necessary facilities for repair and fuel throughout the world. Another guiding principle adopted was &quot; (d.) The desirability of the maintenance of a minimum standard of naval strength, namely, equality with the naval strength of any foreign Power, in accordance with the provisions of the Washington Treaty on Limitation of Armament, as approved by Great Britain, all the self-governing dominions and India.&quot;Prior to the war, the minimum naval standard at which the British Empire aimed was equality with the next two naval powers in the Avorld; but, owing to the great building programmes carried out during the war, and outlined after the war, Great Britain has been compelled to depart from that basis, and now subscribes to a standard which is equal to the naval strength of any foreign power. This, I think, is acceptable to the people of Australia. A resolution was passed dealing with the desirability of the development of the air forces in the several countries of the
Empire, so that imperial co-operation could be achieved should the necessity arise. The principal resolution relating to defence affecting Australia was resolution 4, which reads as follows : &quot; In the application of these principles to the several parts of the Empire concerned, the conference takes note of &apos;&quot; (a.) The deep interest of the Commonwealth of Australia, the Dominion of New Zealand and India, in the provision of a naval base at Singapore as essential for ensuring the mobility necessary to provide for the security of the territories and trade of the Empire in Eastern waters.&quot;This resolution is, of course, of vital concern to Australia, because adequate naval docking facilities in the Pacific are regarded by us as absolutely necessary to obtain what has been laid down as a primary necessity the security of the territories and trade of the Empire. At the 1923 conference I urged very strongly that the con-struction of the Singapore base should be undertaken. I contended that it was purely a defence measure, and, as such, was quite compatible with Australia&apos;s and the Empire&apos;s ideal of a progressive policy of world disarmament, and should be pro-ceeded with until that world disarmament came about. The British Government of the day subscribed to that view, and announced its intention of proceeding with the work of construction as rapidly as possible; but, within a few months, another Government took office in Great Britain, and reversed the decision of its predecessor. On that reversal of policy the Commonwealth Government submitted a naval programme for five years, based upon the assumption that the Singapore base would not be built. It is quite possible that, had the determination to construct the base been accepted by the succeeding British Government, the Commonwealths naval programme might have been varied to include a proposal for a contribution by Australia toAvards the building of the Singapore base. That offer might have taken the form of the supply of material, or there might have been a proposal for the building of a complementary and subsidiary base in Australia. But, with the abandonment of the Singapore project, the Commonwealth laid down a naval pro-gramme to the maximum of its available financial resources, and whilst at the forth-coming conference I shall certainly press for the construction of the Singapore base, because the policy of the British Government in this respect has been approved by this Parliament, and is, I believe, endorsed by an overwhelming majority of the people of Australia, it is quite possible that, as the representative of Australia, I shall be obliged to indicate that the Commonwealth is prepared to assist in this work. The form that assistance should take is a matter for this Parliament to decide, in view of our future financial position, and, in this regard, I think it is only fair to set out exactly what Australia is doing for its defence. The figures that I shall now give should bring home to every one a realisation of the extensive defence programme Australia is carrying out. They show the amount spent in the various portions of the Empire on defence : 					Rate	1	Country.	Year.	Arm of Service.	. Amount appropriated.

Another resolution carried at the Imperial Conference was &quot; 4. (&amp;.) The necessity for the maintenance of safe passage along the great route to the East through the Mediterranean and the Red Sea.&quot;To no part of the Empire is the maintenance of this sea route more essential than to Australia. This is a great vital artery of the British Empire, and while I do not propose to recall the happenings of the past two or three years, I wish to indicate to honourable members that my attitude on this question will be to ensure that nothing is done to weaken this vital avenue of communication for Australia and New Zealand. I do not think it desirable to stress the matter further. The question of Britain&apos;s air defence was also dealt with at the last conference. Being a matter affecting Great Britain&apos;s local defence, it was obviously among those subjects which ought to be left for the sole determination of Great Britain, but there was a strong feeling at the conference that anything which would destroy the heart of the Empire would be fatal to all parts of the Empire. Consequently, a resolution was submitted to which all the representatives of the Empire subscribed.[Further extension of time granted.]   The fifth resolution reads &quot; The Conference, while deeply concerned for the paramount importance of providing for the safety and integrity of all parts of the Empire, earnestly desires, so far as is consistent with this consideration, the further limitation of armaments, and trusts that no opportunity may be lost to promote this object.&quot;That resolution showed the readiness of the Empire to fall in with any scheme the object of which was the reduction of armaments, and that our defence provisions are based on existing conditions throughout the world.I have dealt with matters affecting dominion status and Empire defence. The remainder of the agenda paper covers economic questions. I do not propose to deal with them at great length, because on many previous occasions, both in this House and outside, I have expressed my views regarding them. When I was in Great Britain at the last Imperial Conference I urged very strongly that the future of Great Britain and of the Empire depended on a greater expansion of inter-Empire trade, that on the finding of markets depended the solution of the problem of Empire migration, and the better distribution Of the white peoples of the Empire. From the views which I then expressed I have not departed, particularly as the happenings of the last three years have made it abundantly clear that they were correct.   I am
hopeful that the Development and Migration Commission, whose function it will be to deal with these matters, will result in greater co-operation and the development of inter-Empire trade. Since the last Conference was held, an Imperial Economic Committee has been established, as well as a Marketing Committee, which will have the control of the expenditure of the amount which the British Government voted in substitution of certain preferences which it had promised, but which were not given effect. I believe that the Imperial Economic Committee is doing very valuable work in laying the foundations of schemes for the promotion of inter-Empire trade, which should result in great benefit to Great Britain and to the different parts of the Empire. I believe also that the steps which have been taken in Australia during the last three years have tended towards a realisation of what I believe to be an essential policy for the Empire. Without dwelling further on these questions, I desire to inform the House that the views expressed by me in 1923 will be the views which I shall express again on this occasion. I am not dogmatic as to the manner in which inter-Empire trade ought to be developed. I am prepared to consider any schemes that may be evolved; but I maintain that the fundamental requirement for the development of the dominions is the finding of markets. I believe that for the future of Britain, and the maintenance of the position and prestige of the British Empire, it is essential that the dominions shall be developed and populated. Those, broadly, are the views which I shall express in relation to economic questions.In connection with the Conference generally, I desire to say that I shall attend it not as the representative of any political party or of &quot;any section of the people, but that I shall endeavour to represent the interests of all the people of Australia. Honourable members may not agree with everything that I did at the 1923 conference, but I think that they will at least give me credit for having been animated by the desire to serve the interests of Australia. I shall attend the 1926 Conference animated by the same desire. In discussing this agenda, I ask honourable members to cast aside political bias, and to regard matters solely from, the point of view of the future of Australia. Particularly in regard to those questions which affect the status of the dominions and the relations of the different parts of the Empire to each other, I appeal to honourable members not to be carried away by the desire to express views which might be popular with certain sections of the people, but to realise that upon the manner in which these matters are determined will probably depend the future of the British Empire and of Australia.Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia to the Secretary of State for.Dominion Affairs.Governor-General&apos;s Office, Sir, Melbourne, August, 18, 1926.I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith extracts from the Commonwealth Parliamentary Debates containing the report of the discussion on the agenda of the forthcoming Imperial Conference^The Prime Minister (the Right Hon. S. M. Bruce) laid the agenda-paper for the Conference on the table of the House of Representatives on the 3rd August, and moved that the paper be printed.It will be observed that Mr. Bruce expressed the view that a turning-point has been reached in the relations of the different self-governing parts of the Empire and Great Britain regarding Empire defence and the economic policy of the Empire.In the course of an historical examination of the present position of the self-governing Dominions in the matter of inter-Imperial relations, the Prime Minister said that the Dominions would not tolerate an Imperial Cabinet. In recognition of the full partnership of the peoples of the Empire, the Treaty of Versailles was separately signed on behalf of Great Britain, of the self-governing Dominions and of India; there is a separate membership of the different parts of the Empire of the League of Nations; the self-governing Dominions have the right of diplomatic repre-sentation in foreign countries in relation to those matters with which they are particularly concerned, and also the right to negotiate separate treaties.In connection with the consideration of the new constitutional position, he desired to stress that the British people represent one nation. The dismemberment of the Empire would be tragic, and in the circumstances it is necessary that every-thing possible should be done to ensure the greatest possible measure of Imperial co-operation.* Not printed.
The situation which confronted Australia in respect of the new doctrine of Imperial relationship requires to be carefully considered from three points of view :-.1. The Dominions are self-governing ;2. With regard to Imperial foreign policy, the fullest possible consideration is given by the Imperial Government to any views offered by the Dominions concerning it; and3. The position in the event of an outbreak of war.j  :In connection with the last-mentioned point of view, Mr. Bruce pointed out that in time of war the British Empire is a single unit. It is open for the Dominions to determine what, if any, active participation they will take in the conduct of hostilities, but when war has been declared by the Imperial Government, all the parts of the Empire are at war. The Prime Minister, commenting on a recent utterance by the Prime Minister of South Africa, said that the suggested declara-tion to the world Powers asserting the international independence of the Dominions and claiming for them recognition as separate international units is hopelessly irreconcilable with the idea of unity of the British Empire, and he added that &quot;Australians aspiration must be a closer linking together of all the self-governing portions of the Empire, with as full a recognition of the independent status of all the self-governing Dominions as is compatible with the recognition of our mutual British nationality and the maintenance of the closest possible relations between the English-speaking peoples.&apos;&apos;Mr. Bruce further stated that Australia could not enjoy the privileges of nationality as part of the British Empire without accepting the obligations. He outlined some of the effects of this country becoming an independent nation, one of which would be the need to provide for its own defence, and said that the view of the Commonwealth Government is that the safety of Australia is ensured by the fact that it is part of the British Empire, and that its surest line of defence is co-operation with Great Britain.The Prime Minister mentioned the means of consultation at present employed and the position occupied by the High Commissioners in this connection, and said that the principal task is to create the machinery which will enable the Dominions to have a real voice in the foreign policy of the Empire. He expressed his desire to stress the point that any Dominion which so desires can create the machinery which will enable it to be kept fully informed upon matters of foreign policy.Mr. Bruce devoted a considerable portion of his speech to the Treaty of Locarno, and urged members to express their views regarding it. He gave an assurance that he would take no action at the Imperial Conference with respect to the ratification of the Treaty until the Commonwealth Parliament had approved of its ratification. %The Prime Minister drew attention to the resolutions of- the last Imperial Con-ference concerning Empire Defence, which he considers represent broadly the views to which the people of Australia would subscribe. He announced his intention to press at the forthcoming Conference for the construction of the naval base at Singapore.On economic questions he will express at the Conference the views he enunciated at the 1923 Conference.The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. M. Charlton-Labour Party), who con-tinued the debate on the 4th August, expressed opposition to a claim on behalf of Australia to have a voice in the foreign affairs of the Empire. He said that his loyalty and that of Australia to the Empire was undoubted, but the assistance which Australia had always readily given to the Mother Country when the latter was in trouble had been voluntary. The adoption of the policy advocated by the Prime Minister would involve the compulsion of Australia to take part in any war entered into by Great Britain. He contended that the people of this country should be allowed, as in the past, to decide whether they will join in any particular war, and whether Australians are to be sent to fight overseas. In his view, nothing would be more likely to disintegrate the Empire than to change the policy which has been in existence since responsible government was given to Australia. Mr. Charlton repeated the views of the Labour Party regarding foreign policy, which had been expressed by him in connection with the recent general election, as follows : 
&quot;The Labour Party stands for an Australian foreign policy developed in Australia in the light of day, developed for a people and by a people who are determined to uphold the rights which properly belong to a nation, and honest enough to admit that other nations have co-equal rights. It will prize &apos; self-determination&apos; not merely for itself, but as the heritage of all men in all lands.&apos;&apos;The very large number of the people of Australia represented by the Labour -Party are, he added, against any change in the present system.He urged that Australia should not subscribe to the Locarno Treaty, and that this country should not become a party to treaties relating entirely to European affairs.Mr. Charlton further stated that he agreed with the contention that the construction of a base at Singapore is not in keeping with the spirit of the Washington Conference.With regard to overseas settlement, the Leader of the Oppposition said that the Labour Party is not opposed to immigration, but it does not believe in the bringing of people to Australia without preparation having previously been made for their reception. At the present time people are being brought from abroad to swell the ranks of the unemployed. He had approved of the Government^ proposal to create a development and migration commission, but, until that commission has completed its investigations and shown clearly that the country can find profitable employment for more people, it is not right to encourage immigration.He hoped that the Australian representatives at the Conference will urge Great Britain to do a little more than has been done in the past to increase the consumption of Australian products. An exhaustive investigation should be made into the prices charged by the middle-men who handle Australian produce in England.The Conference could profitably consider ways and means of bringing about thorough co-operation between Great Britain and the Dominions in regard to research work.He hoped the Prime Minister would entirely disagree with any suggestion that State enterprises shall be subject to taxation; and he urged that the question of reciprocity within the Empire with regard to widows&apos;, old-age and invalid pensions be considered by the Conference.The Right Hon. W. M. Hughes said that the component parts of the Empire are free nations, and that nothing can give them greater freedom than they now have, so that any alteration of the status of the Dominions can only be to diminish their power, by imposing limitations upon them. He declared himself to be irrevocably opposed to any attempt to define our powers.&apos;&apos; The strength of the British Empire is unity. Unity requires Australia to accept responsibilities, and one of those responsibilities is that of defence. The Empire &quot;must be preserved in the interests not merely of ourselves although its preservation is vital to us  but also of civilisation.&quot; Although local defence is the proper business of each of the Dominions, the defence of the Empire is the business of all. Mr. Hughes expressed his opinion that the proper basis of naval defence of the Empire is a fair per capita levy on the white populations of its various parts. He considered the Treaty of Locarno should be ratified by the Commonwealth Parliament immediately. He stated that he is strongly in favour of whatever arrangement can be made to give Australia a more effective share in the moulding of the Empire&apos;s foreign policy; and that, personally, he does not believe that anything except an improvement of the means of communication will materially help Australia in this connection.The Right Hon. W. A. Watt also emphatically endorsed the Prime Minister&apos;s statement that the members of the Empire are one people and one nation. He considered Australia should pay something towards the cost of the Singapore base. There are, he submitted, elements of danger in the direct line of communication of the several parts of the Empire with the Secretariat of the League of Nations, and he urged that the presentation of different views by those parts should be prevented by prior consultation between them. Further, communications with the League should be laid on the table of the Commonwealth Parliament when in session. He disagreed with the view of the Leader of the Opposition with regard to consultation between the- Motherland and the Dominions in international affairs, and urged the consideration by the Imperial Conference of means to improve communication for the purpose of that consultation.   He affirmed that the failure of the Commonwealth
Government to reply concerning the Locarno Treaty must not be taken as a precedent, nor used, as a discouragement to Britain.to send information to Australia about developing international affairs, and hoped that the Commonwealth Parliament would have an opportunity to say definitely what it thinks of the treaty. Speaking of Empire defence, he stated that there must be co-operation for naval and for military defence throughout the Empire.When the order of the day for the resumption of the debate in the House of Representatives was reached on the 13th August the last day of meeting prior to the recess the motion for the printing of the paper was carried without further debate, no other member than those mentioned above having taken part in the discussion.From a perusal of the attached leading articles from the principal newspapers of Australia on the subject of the Prime Ministers statement^ it will be seen that the press comment has been favourable, with the exception that the two Labour newspapers indicate a fear, particularly in respect of the Treaty of Locarno, that Australia may be committed to participate in a European war.I have, &amp;c.SOMERS, Deputy of the Governor-General.* Not printed.
