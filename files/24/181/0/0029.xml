(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY.. OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S QQTEBNMEatT 1. CP. 329(86).COPY BO.   J(JCABINET.SeeP..6(26).THE COAL DISPUTE.COPY OP LETTER PROM THE CHAIRMAN Qg THE MINING ASSOCIATION TO THE CHANCELLOR&apos; oTTrBE EXOffTOElE-Tho Mining Association of Great Britain.General Buildings, Aldwych,Londons W0C2t13th. September,  19E6.BY HAND.The Rt.Hon. Winston So Churchill, MoPu, Treasury,London,    S.YJ.1.Pear Chancellor of the Exchequer,I am now in a position to reply to your letter of the 8th instant31, the receipt of which I formally acknowledged on the same day.Copies of yqur letter were at once circulated to thedistrict associations so that they might have it before themwhen-they gave consideration to the question which we both agreed at the meeting on the 6th instant $as the only one at issue at&apos;the moment,  and which you expressed in the following words:-&quot;Is there to be any national agreement at all,  or is the industry in future to be regulated purely by district agreements without any national v/age negotiating body&quot;.With the exception of one small inland district, the twenty-four district associations have replied clearly andemphatically declining to give the Mining Association power or authority to enter into agreements on their hehplf in regardto terms of employment ofthe workmen in their respective districts.You will accordingly see that the, meeting which you pi^ppese inyour letter could serve no useful purpose.    There is no person w&amp;o
would be entitled to speal or to listen on behalf of the coalowners, and I am sure you will agree that no good, but harm, would result from a meeting held under conditions which would expose the parties to a charge of insincerity.The distriot coalowners1 associations have been and are willing and anxious to meet the miners1 associations in their districts at any time without ceremony or any preliminary procedure whatsoever.-     There is no valid obstacle to this.    There is no question of principle that need delay them.     None of the district associations raises any objection to the principle of wage regulation by reference tc ascertained results, the principle of a minimum percentage below which wages cannot fall, or the principle af subsistence wages. - The quantitative determinations on those and all other points can only be made in the light of the circumstances of the districts by those who know them and have to face the results.A realisation of these facts is imperative,  and it is failure to recognise them that stands in the way of these negotiations being entered Into at once and is alone responsible for the prolongation of the stoppage.I desire to add that- the decisions of the districts,.-which re-affirm the declarations made to you last Monday, arise from a deep and earnest conviction that settlements on a national basis, by linking the industry with politics, inevitably take the consideration of purely industrial questions out  of their proper economic sphere, have been destructive of peace and prosperity to those engaged in the industry,  and, as experience of the.immediate past has shewn, are a menace to the community as a whole.Yours sincerely,(Sd. ) EVAN WIILI/MS.
