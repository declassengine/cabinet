II.-POSITION  IN  CHIEF  INDUSTRIES.COAL MINING.The further improvement in coal-mining which took place during April was largely owing to accelerated output in anticipation of a stoppage of work. In the absence of the usual statistics it is difficult to give any further detailed comparison of the position in the two succeeding months.IRON AND STEEL.Except in a few areas there was little material change in the position of the iron and steel industries during April. Thereafter employment was very seriously affected by the general strike. During June transport difficulties and shortage of fuel supplies resulted in a further curtailment of production.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.The depression in shipbuilding did not clear up to any appreciable extent during April. In the two succeeding months there was not a large increase in unemployment, although the prospects of any decided improvement are somewhat more remote. Repair work was generally slack.ENGINEERING.In common with the other coal-consuming industries, engineering as a whole has shown a considerable increase in unemployment during the quarter, the branch least affected being the constructional section, which was fairly active. In the motor industry employment remained fair. General engineering has been fairly active, but, during the last weeks of June, there was a tendency to slacken production on account of shortage of fuel.   In railway works short time has been very prevalent.TEXTILES.Cotton. In the cotton industry there was an increasing amount of short-time working, especially in the American spinning section. The usual seasonal improve-ment towards the end of June was not forthcoming.Woollen and Worsted. The position is still very unsatisfactory, and there was little sign of any recovery from the acute depression in these industries.Other Textiles. The usual seasonal slackness in the hosiery trade has commenced. In the silk industry employment was fairly good and there was not any considerable increase in unemployment during the quarter. In the lace trade much short-time working has taken place. This also applies to the jute industry, where the position during the quarter has been very serious.BUILDING. BRICK AND TILE MANUFACTURE.Employment in the building industry has been affected by the lack of materials and the restriction of transport facilities. Notwithstanding this, it has remained fairly good in most areas. The demand for bricklayers and plasterers was main-tained, but unskilled labourers were unemployed in considerable numbers.CLOTHING TRADES.The normal seasonal activity in the clothing trades has not been apparent to the same extent this year, and considerable ground was lost during May. During June a slight recovery took place, the boot and shoe trades in particular showing considerable improvement during this month.POTTERY.This industry is amongst those which have been very seriously hit by the coal dispute.
TRANSPORT, DOCK LABOUR AND SHIPPING SERVICES.The effect of the coal dispute has been particularly severe in these services. In railway services for this time of the year the amount of short time worked has been abnormal, while in the docks work has been slack owing to the number of vessels which have been laid up. The employment of seamen has been very unsatisfactory during the quarter.
783III.-WORK INSTITUTED FOR RELIEF OF UNEMPLOYMENT.Numbers Employed.[See note on page 1 of November 1924 Report (CP. 541 (24) ).] The table which follows has been prepared to show, so far as information is available, the number of men employed on works instituted, with financial assistance from the Exchequer or the Road Fund, for the relief of unemployment.Scope of Table. The schemes included are those undertaken by Local and other Authorities and Public Companies with a financial contribution from the State with the object of relieving unemployment; certain schemes gut in hand by Government Departments for the same purpose; and works in respect of which guarantees have been given under the Trade Facilities Acts as capital undertakings calculated to promote employment in this country. Schemes to which State financial assistance is given, but which are not undertaken primarily for the relief of unemployment (e.g., Housing Schemes), and Avorks put in hand by Local Authorities without State assistance are not included. Certain other schemes involving Government assistance are also excluded in view of the impracticability of ascertaining the exact number of men who are directly provided with employment thereby; these include the Export Credits Scheme and contracts for equipment, clothing, &amp;c, accelerated by Government Contracting Departments.Method of Compilation. The figures for the Road and assisted by the Ministry of Transport and for schemes Unemployment Grants Committee are (with the exception schemes in respect of which returns are received direct by Transport) obtained from returns received at Employment Local and other Authorities and Public Companies. Those relating to schemes assisted under the Trade Facilities Acts are compiled by the Trade Facilities Act Advisory Committee from returns received from Companies to whom guarantees under the Acts have been given. In the case of the remaining works the figures are compiled or estimated by the Departments mentioned. The figures given for June, 1925, which have been prepared (so far as information is available) on the same basis as that now in use,.provide an approximately accurate comparison.Bridge Schemes assisted by the of certain road the Ministry of Exchanges  fromWorks assisted by-Number of Men employed at June 26,1926.- May 29,1926.April 24,1926,June 27,1925.1.

The figures take no account of the employment provided indirectly, e.g., in the preparation and transport of materials, &amp;c.t No figures available.t No distinction is now made between the Forestry Commission^ normal and relief work, and grants for afforestation form part of the normal programme. The average number of the Commission^ Forest Employees during the quarter ended June 30th, 1926, was 2,687 as compared with 2,328 for the corresponding quarter of 1925.5 Scheme completed.II These figures indicate men employed on the work itself. They include part only of the men employed on the manufacture of the materials used. They take no account of the labour involved in winning, transporting, &amp;c, raw materials.
IV.-OVERSEAS SETTLEMENT. (Colonial Office.)Under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922 (an Act to make better provision for furthering British settlement in His Majesty&apos;s Oversea Dominions), various schemes have been agreed with Dominion Authorities. This Act, as its title implies, is not one of the Government measures designed to deal with unemployment, and should not be so regarded. It should be borne in mind that the excess of the total outward over the total inward movement from this country is somewhat less than 100,000 a year, and therefore small in comparison with the natural increase of population which for many years before and after the war has not been much less than 400,000 a year.The number of persons approved for assistance and the number of departures during the months of April, May and June (with the corresponding figures for last year) and for the three months ended the 30th June, 1926 and 1925, respectively, are set out in the following Table:-Quarterly Progress Return relating to Schemes approved under &quot; The Empire Settlement Act, 1922.&quot;Approval and Departure Figures.Dominion.

The Scheme, however, closed to new applications in December 1922.50r.lee

With regard to the latter, the methods of financial co-operation are so diverse that it is impracticable to give an aggregated figure of Exchequer Assistance. For this reason, the accompanying Summary is only indicative of the extent to which the Exchequer is involved, and must be regarded as supplementary to, and not in substitution of, the detailed information given in the Tables themselves.Summary.(A.)Schemes.

The cost of the Overseas settlement free passage scheme for ex-Service men and women and their dependants (now rapidly approaching termination), which up to 31st March, 1926, had amounted to approximately  2,419,450, is not included in this table. Neither is the cost included of certain training of ex-Service men carried out in Ireland at a cost to the.Imperial Exchequer of approximately  255,425.
Unemployment Insurance. (Estimates, Class VII, Vote 3.)The National Insurance Act of 1911 provided Insurance against unemployment in certain selected industries. It was followed by the Act of 1916, which increased the numbers of persons insured, and, in 1920, by an Act of general scope which applied compulsory Insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions of receipt of benefit, increased contributions, provided benefit in respect of dependants, and authorised the Treasury to make advances out of the Consolidated Fund up to a limit of  30,000,000.By the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1924 the rates of benefit were raised (from 15s.) to 18s. a week for men, and (from 12*.) to 15s. a week for women, with 2s. (instead of Is.) a week for each young dependent child. Until the 30th June, 1926, benefit in respect of contributions may be paid for 26 weeks in a benefit year, while benefit, irrespective of contributions, may be paid during unemployment subject to the satisfaction of special conditions. The Act also amends the disqualification for benefit in the case of persons affected by trade disputes, and it abolishes the right to a refund of contributions at the age of 60, subject to the payment of compensation for the loss of refund rights in certain cases.Statement of Income and Expenditure from Armistice to July 3, 1926.Expenditure                     Benefit paid         ....          ....          .... 254,127,000Appropriation for Administration   .... 24,559,000Section 9 Unemployment InsuranceAct (No. 2), 1924        ....          .... 1,489,000Miscellaneous Refunds, &amp;o.....          ....          .... 3,028,000--   283,203,000Income Contributions Employers           ....          .... .... 98,036,000Employed            ....          .... .... 88,618,000Exchequer   . &quot;      ....          .... .... 65,986,000Exchequer (for ex-Service Men) .... 3,524,000256,164,000Interest (Net)....         ....          ....          .... 271,000Balance of Old Fund at Armistice (excluding Interest accrued) *-Employers           .........          .... 5,825,000Employed            ....          ....          .... 5,825,000Exchequer           ....          ....          .... 3,884,000H --     15,534,000tLoans from Treasury (Net)....          ....          .... 10,498,000Miscellaneous Deposits in respect of future  Contribu-P tions, &amp;c.....         ............ 736,000283,203,000* Note.-The old Fund at November 8th, 1920, had reached a total of  22,210,000.Estimate of Benefit payable from Armistice to March 31, 1927,  280,582,000.t The corresponding figure for December 1925 was  7,595,000, which was subsequently reduced by a -sum of  332,431, due by the Irish Free State in respect of the apportionment of the Assets and Liabilities of the Fund as at March 31, 1922, phis Interest, which has been taken over by the Exchequer as at December 31, 1925.

(O.) Ministry of Transport Schemes.Road and Bridge Programme, 1919-20. To assist in the provision of employment for demobilised members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces until such time as they could be re-absorbed into industry, the Government after the Armistice inaugurated a special fund for the purpose of making grants on certain conditions to Highway Authorities for road work. The total of such grants has amounted to approximately  9,328,000 for Great Britain and it is estimated that the works carried out by Local Authorities in order to earn :i grant aggregated in cost to approximately  20,000,000.Unemployment Works assisted out of the Road Fund. 1920-23 Programmes. :The first &quot; Unemployment Programme &quot; proper was initiated by the Ministry of Transport in the Winter of 1920/21, and the following statement shows the total estimated expenditure by the contributing parties to date and a forecast of expendi-ture during subsequent years, against the three programmes instituted prior to October 1923.Payments during Year.

February 1924 Programme.A further additional programme estimated to cost  13,500,000 was authorised by the late Government, towards which the Road Fund was to contribute a maximum&apos; of  10,400,000. Owing to the inclusion of certain road schemes previously covered by earlier programmes, the estimated cost and the amount of the Road Fund contribution now show a slight increase. This programme includes the construction of the Liverpool-Oldham (formerly Manchester) road.The following statement shows the expenditure by the contributing parties to the end of 1925/26 and a forecast of expenditure during subsequent years : 		Local	Payments during Year.

Table 4. Land Settlement.In England and Wales the provision of small holdings under the Land Settle-ment (Facilities) Act, 1919, and other Land Settlement Schemes for the benefit primarily of ex-Service men, are carried out (a) through the agency of County Councils and Councils of County Boroughs and (6) through the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.Settlement through Local Authorities.-The net capital cost of these schemes up to the 31st March, 1926, when the Land Settlement Scheme came to an end, is estimated to be  15,250,000, of which approximately  14,050,000 (net) was loaned by the Public Works Loan Board. Interest in respect of such loans is payable bv Councils. Under Section 26 of the Land Settlement (Facilities) Act, 1919, the Exchequer bears the loss incurred up to the 31st March, 1926, on the Councils&apos; Small Holdings account (e.g., due to charging a fair as opposed to an economic rent), so far as such loss had been reasonably and necessarily incurred.As from the 1st April, 1926, the Exechequer assistance takes the form of annual contributions to meet the difference between the loan charges and the estimated net income from the Councils&apos; estates. These contributions will not commence until the year 1927-28 and their total capitalized value cannot at present be estimated.In Scotland land settlement is not conducted through the agency of County Councils.Ministry&apos;s Settlements. Since the Armistice a number of properties have been acquired, and the capital expenditure thereon and the difference, if any, between the annual cost of maintaining and administering them and the rents received from small holders is being borne by the Exchequer. Some of these properties have been disposed of and the net expenditure on the remainder does not involve an appreciable cash call upon the Exchequer, as additional capital expenditure is met from the surplus cash revenue or from proceeds of sale of property.Land Settlement.(A.)

Juveniles.After the Armistice, Juvenile Unemployment Centres were opened in certain localities to deal with the problem of unemployed juveniles. After a period of closure centres were again established, and the cost, which was originally shared by the Board of Education and Local Authorities, was, from the 1st April, 1923, to the 31st March, 1924, partly met out of Relief of Unemployment Vote by grants up to 75 per cent, in respect of approved schemes, the Local Authority providing the remaining 25 per cent. From the 1st April, 1924, the Exchequer Grant was, as an emergency measure, for so long as unemployment amongst juveniles remains acute, raised to 100 per cent, of the approved out-of-pocket expenses of Local Education Authorities.From the 1st April, 1926, the Exchequer Grant was revised as follows : (1.) To Authorities in whose areas the average rate of unemployment among insured juveniles exceeded 6 per cent, during the tivelve months which ended on the 23rd November, 1925.A per capita grant fixed by the Minister for each Authority separately equal to the approved average weekly cost to the Authority of each Juvenile in average attendance, taking into account recurrent expenditure only, during the twelve months which ended on the 30th June, 30th September, or 31st December, 1925, whichever was the latest period for which consecutive claims had been received. If complete figures for one year ending on one of the above dates were not available, or if the Authority had not previously opened Centres, the per capita grant was fixed by the Minister on such information, including the Authority&apos;s proposals for 1926/27, as was available to him.(2.) To Authorities in whose areas the average rate of unemployment among insured juveniles was not less than 3 per cent, and not more than 6 per cent, during the twelve months which ended on the 23rd November, 1925.Either (i) a per capita grant calculated as in (1) above, but equal to three-quarters only of the approved average weekly cost, or (ii) a grant of 75 per cent, of the approved out-of-pocket expenditure incurred by the Authority during the financial year 1926/27, as the Authority chose.[14950] d 2Schemes for Training Women and Juveniles and Young Unemployed Fit Men.(Estimates, Unclassified Services, Vote 2.)(a.) Women.The following table aggregates: (i) the expenditure incurred wholly by theMinistry of Labour in connection with the Registered.Unemployed Woinen&apos;s Scheme which operated from 1919 to 1921; (ii) the expenditure on schemes for training women in Domestic Service, &amp;c, under the auspices of the Central Committee for Women&apos;s Training. Up to the 31st July, 1924, the cost of this scheme was met partly from Exchequer Grants and party from other sources, but, as from the 1st August, 1924, the whole cost has been borne by the Exchequer.
(3.) To Authorities in whose areas the average rate of unemployment among insured juveniles was less than 3 per cent, during the year which ended on the 23rd November, 1925.Normally no grant is payable, but if in the case of a County Council the Authority can show that there are clearly defined districts where the average percentage of insured juveniles unemployed during the year was definitely abnormal, the Minister is prepared in approved cases to sanction grant as in (2) above in respect of expenditure on Centres serving these districts.In the case of approved Centres established by Authorities who are Authorities for elementary education, only grant is paid under (1) or (2) above, according to the percentage of unemployment among insured juveniles in the area of the Authority for elementary education only, provided that the proposal of the Authority has received the concurrence of the County Authority concerned.Net Expenditure from Armistice to March 31, 1926.
