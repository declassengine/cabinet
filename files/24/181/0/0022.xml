gfllN/U THE .SECRETARY....OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSfr^IHQ^ON       explained that he had called together at short notice ^gjECT those Ministers who were available in order to consult them as to the reply to be sent to a telegram which had been received from the Acting British Consul-General at Canton.  (No.  37 elated 28th August, 1926,    Appendix I).The Foreign Secretary reminded the Conferenoo of the toleration which had been shown by His Majesty1a Government to outrages and boycott In China partly because of our Impotence and partly because China was a Member of tl^ League of Nations.    No action at Geneva was likely to be effective at the present time in view of the confusion prevailing iii China.    The position was growing steadily worse and in the opinion of the Foreign Office the outrage described in the telegram should not go unpunished.The Conference agreed:-(l)    That a reply should be sent by theForeign Office to the Acting British Consul-General, Canton, On the lines set forth in Appendix II, after its .terms had been adjusted with the Admiralty.(2)    That copies of the agreed reply shouldbe sent for information to the War Office and the Air Ministry.2 Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1, 30th August, 1926.

This morning they were taking Chinese passengers from Customs wharf to Hongkong steamer when they were fired at from all sides by pickets in boats,    They put hack to Customs wharf and Lllliorap escaped unhurt to Shemeen by road although pickets fired at him on the way.    Banbury and a white Russian assistant were seized but subsequently released on American representationsc   Motor boat has disappeared but His Majesty&apos;s ships are looking for it and will recapture it if found.Pickets! are becoming bolder and open fire daily on boats and junks bound for Hongkong steamer.    If you approve I -would urge that Corflmander-in--Chief be requested to instruct Senior Naval Officer to make reprisals for this firing on a British subject, and seizure of his boat, by carrying out proposal (A) In my despatch of August 16th i.e. to seize all strike picket boats and disable them.United States Consul-Genera1 and I are making usual protest which will to ignored.Repeated to Foreign Office No. 37 and commands-irir Chief.
APPENDIX_II.CHINA.(F 3535/1/10)Cypher telegram to Mr. Brenan,      (Canton)Foreign Office,  31st August, 1926.     2.30 p.m. No. 19.Your telegram No. 37*(firing by strike pickets on British subject^.In the circumstances forcible measures to prevent acts of piracy by strike pickets would appear to be fully justified and Admiralty have sent orders to Commander-in-Chief to seize and disable picket boats.      You should consult with naval authorities what if any further action against pickets is possible and report.      You will of course take care not to get Involved in street fighting. If co-operation of local American naval forces can be secured without serious delay it would be most Important to arrange it.Repeat to Peking and HongKong.
