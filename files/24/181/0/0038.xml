 13 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)THE INDUS [TRIAL COURT (TEMPORARY POvVERS) bill memorandum on by the Secretary for Mines*The outline of this Bill,  as provisionally approved by the Coal Committee yesterday, provided for the Tribunal decide-ing all matters which have hitherto been dealt with by national agreements,  and with hours, with power to vary by districts.The Bill as now drafted empowers the Tribunal to deal with hours and the minimum percentage, to determine districts for the purpose,  and to vary by districts.The result is to exclude from their purview the principle of the ratio, and of recoupment.The reasons for this omission are that the inclusion of these items is (a) very difficult If not impracticable,  and (b) unnecessary.There would be no difficulty in the Tribunal prescribing what the ratio of division should be, but that in itself means nothing.    They would have to prescribe also exactly how the ascertainment should be made, and this would mean prescribing not only the detailed rules about what costs etc, are admissible or otherwise,  but all the machinery whereby the returns should bo made and checked etc.  - or in other words directing the industry themselves to operate a complicated, and rather expensive, machine which they may not  . wish to do.      The difficulties of enforcement are obvious.JB C R E T. .P. 338 (36).C A B IN E T
** u a/It would be necessary to provide that,   in the last  resort, the  Government should be empowered to do it for them.    This would need a financial resolution and would otherwise add much n to the difficulties both of drafting and of carrying the Bill, in addition to involving the Government in the conduct of the industry to a degree whieh the Government would, probably not wi sh oIt is moreover not necessary.This Bill is aimed at the issues with which the dispute is  really concerned,  he. hours, minimum percentages and national supervision thereof, and, perhaps to a less degree,  the demarcation of districts-    With these disposed of,the questions of method of ascertainment of the ratio,  and recoupment would not prolong the dispute for a. single minute.nor is a Government called upon in any circumstances - not even in the Trade Board industries,  - to  concern itself with anything but the minimum standards of the workmen. So long as these are secured the question what more they may obtain can,  from a Government point of view,  be settled in any way that the
e* &amp; e*indust ry chooses.Moreover, the only economic argument in favour oi national settlements is that they are required in order to prevent undercutting of one district by another.    The real safeguard qgainst this lies in prescribing the minimum percentage  and the hours  of work;    the ratio of division when wages are above the minimum is immaterial.Lor indeed is it entirely certain that the industry are very anxious to perpetuate the principle of ascertainment which is embodied in the Agreements of 1921 and 19 24.    They may con-conceivably prefer to revert to the old Conciliation Board system.    Is it  right,  or necessary, that Parliament should concern itself with this?     The proposed Bill in its present form is applicable to any form of dividing the proceeds above tho minimum percentage.Finally,  it is perhaps worth  observing that even if the Bill went through on the lines originally proposed,  it would not  &apos; safeguard tho menls wages in all respects.    It would not safe-guard basis  rates at all.    The answer to that would be that the dispute does not concern basis rates,  and the Bill is to deal with the dispute, which brings one back again to the fact that for that purpose tho scope of the Bill as now drafted.^ is ^sufficiently wide.G.R.I-F.Min e s Dep artment,September 24th 1926-
