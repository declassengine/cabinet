In the main they relate to persons who had claims 10 benefit current and were not at work on the dates given.(2.) The figures above for the five weeks in August are exclusive of persons in the Goal-mining Industry who ceased work on account of the dispute which commenced on the 1st May.(3.) The latest figures available, viz., for the weeks ended the 13th and 20th September, 1926, are given in Part (D) of this Report.The percentage of unemployment (Great Britain) in the insured industries at the undermentioned dates was August 25, 1924 24, 1925 23,192610-3 11-9139 (men only 15-5)It will be seen from the above Table that during the five weeks ended the 30th August the numbers on the registers decreased to the extent of 55,661. The unemployment curve has now fallen steadily since the beginning of July, but there were 567,882 more persons unemployed on the 30th August than on the 26th April, 1926, apart from those in the Coal-mining Industry who ceased work on account of the dispute.

(B.) Analysis of the Number of Persons on the Registers of Employment Exchanges in Great Britain at the 30th August, 1926.Wholly unemployed Temporary stoppages CasualsTotalMen.718,176 373,878 76,4031,168,457Women.103,422 184,426 705288,553Boys.33,826 13,184 13847,148Girls.31,044 14,541 1645,601Total.886,468 586,029 77,2621,549,759Increase ( 4-) or Decrease (-) since July 26.4    28,645- 83,613- 693-    55,661The detailed analysis given above shows that the total net reduction in unemployment during the month is accounted for by the substantial decrease in the number of temporary stoppages. In one important respect the position is less satisfactory than at the end of last month, in that there has been an increase of 28,645 in the number of those who are wholly unemployed.(C.) Unemployment in Insured Industries.The latest date for which unemployment figures by industries are available is the 23rd August, 1926, at which date the percentage unemployed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 14&quot;2, as compared with 14&quot;6 at the 26th July, 1926, with 121 at the 24th August, 1925, and with 10*5 at the 25th August, 1924. The figures at the 23rd August in respect of industries showing appreciable variations in unemployment during the month, together with the increase or decrease as compared with the previous month, with the 26th April, 1926, and with a year ago are given in the table below: Industry.M umber of Insured Persons recorded as Unemployed at August 23, 1926.Increase (-(-) or Decrease ( ) compared with-:July 26, 1926.

The further reduction in unemployment during last month cannot, unfor-unfortunately, be taken as indicative of any general improvement in industry. Apart from the normal increased employment in the harvest period, it is largely accounted for by a somewhat artificial stimulus in a few industrial centres. Thus, in the Cotton, and to a lesser extent in the Woollen and Worsted Industries,, the reduction in unemployment is due to a temporary resumption of full-time working after extended holiday stoppages. This also applies to the position in the Jute Industry, where, however, the improvement seems to be of an even more temporary nature. An increase in the available supplies of coal and a further adaptation of plant to the use of oil fuel have contributed to reduce the unemployment in certain other industries, such as the Pottery Trade. Largely owing to the increased imports during the month, employment at the docks has been somewhat more steady.There is, on the other hand, increasing evidence of the disastrous effects of the continuance of the Coal-mining dispute. Shipbuilding and Engineering have suffered a further relapse. In the Iron and Steel Trades, except in a few areas where foreign coal was available, events have also taken a turn for the worse. It appears, moreover, that the paralysis is gradually extending to the Distributive Trades, while the normal slackness in the Motor Industry and in the Tailoring-Trades has doubtless been accentuated this year by the same cause.(D.) Latest Figures.The latest figures of unemployment published are those for the 13th September, giving the total number on the registers as 1,551,924. This is an increase over the position on the 30th August amounting to 2,165, and an increase over a year ago of 160,392. The preliminary figure for the 20th September is 1,532,400, showing a decrease in one week of 19,524.ARTHUR STEEL-MAITLAND.Ministry of Labour,September 28, 1926.
