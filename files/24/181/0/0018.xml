noCpMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)&quot;.J. &amp; t)COPY HO: j__OA B I I-&apos;! E T,THE COAL SITUATION.SHORTHAND NOTES cf a letting between the Central Committee of the Mining Association and the Executive Committee of the Liners&apos; Federation, held on Thursday, August 19th, 19260THE CHAIRMAN:     Kr, Smith, I do not know whether, with your recent ecclesiastical associations you have developed the habit of starting the proceedings with prayer and a hymn, and I hope you will not find it strange if we do away with that this afternnon and. get straight on to &quot;business. MR. COOK:     Do you suggest we need it?THE CH A IRE AN:      vVe had your letter yesterday morning and the few of us who were in London decided at once to call up our Central Committee to meet you at the earliest possible opportunity in order that we might hear what you have to say, and that we might make each other&apos;s position quite clear at any rate so that there may be no doubt in thefiinds of either side as to where the other stands.Perhaps the better plan would be for you to let us know your views upon the present situation in the industry --at least,  one can hardly call it an industry at the moment because of the situation with regard to the stoppage of the mines       and we will then deal with the matter in the light of what you have to say. -MR&apos;. HERBERT SMITH:      I do not know, Mr, Chairman, that we were responsible for your summoning your full Committee or no Committee:      what we asked for was an Interview like you have asked for during this process.      Because it is 111 clays, whether we realise it or not, since the industry came to a. stand-still, and if we keep looking at one another it can be another 111 days before it starts again;      and we thought we might probably be able to have a talk and compare notes and see whether any- - -i-J^E T. 318 (261.
t 4JL ivt *possibility at all existed, of getting any settlement,I want to make this position clear.     We did not seek this meeting with any idea that we were hereto beg to get back to work.      We are here to talk things over if it is possible and see whether a settlement can be arrived at for this industry to get away about Its business again.      We know a little bit about the industry which sometimes we are led to ponder as to whether we know all we should like to know about it; because we get statements out when things like this happen that we&apos; never get out when we are working, and we seem to get information in that direction which is sometimes helpful and sometimes not helpful.      So that we ai*e asking you to meet us to have a general talk on the situation.It is true that.the majority of our men received notice to sever their contract of service.      It is true that some did not receive notice - a few of them.      It is also true that while that notice was running certain other conditions were put up saying that the men could continue to work on certain conditions, which was not acceptable and which, was not worked on.As I have already said, we have a fairly good contingent of our men yet who are as resolute as it is possible to be; but while you are resolute you want to be sensible; and that is why we asked for this meeting to see whether any mode of pro-cedure could be devised for opening out negotiations and to see if a settlement could be arrived at - not, as some people anticipated,&apos;probably to-day or to-morrow, but that we should go carefully through this thing and see how far we met one another eye to eye0     Because we know under what conditions we worked up to the 30th of April, and we knowing your views and you know-ing our views, and certain people have stepped in and given different interpretations as to what was intended and what was not intended.     There have been three cardinal points amongst us of big interest to each other which I take it have been really
simmered dovm to about one now if we get to talk on sub jectsj.^ 5 iVe clearly understood, I think, that negotiations or agreements should have a general outlook for the Federation as a whole. We also knew that as far as working conditions were concerned apart, from what one is naming now, they stood as they were.Take, if you like, the question of hours.     There cannot be any two opinions on hours.      It is true that the Government have said, &quot;Well, it is true we have passed an Act of Parliament that is non-binding,  or permissive, whatever you like to ca.ll it.&quot;     It is true we had a seven hours day working; and it is true that you people told us with no uncertain voice that as far as you were concerned the present rate of wages could not be continued as you were going on at tha.t time, .   There is room for talk in that direction; because we say that there are certain leeways to be made up and enquired into as to what can be done and cannot be done.      Because I think everyone will agree with this, however much we may not agree on other points, that a  servant as long as he is a servant is worthy of his hire, and his hire must be such that he can live a respectable life, and if the country wants coal it must be prepared to meet that position,      I think that is a cardinal point.      Then you people will say,  on the other hand, &quot;Yes, and the people who invest their money In this industry ought to have a return for it&quot;, I do not think any of us would say &quot;No&quot; as a final answer; but we should say that wages and conditions must be the first con-siderations to the person who has to produce that wealth, if any is produced, before any secondary division comes into it.The consequence is that my Committee is here this afternoon in this way, to have a general talk with you people, to see on what we can agree, and to try and arrive as far as we possibly can at the points we can agree, and see what the points are that we disagree upon.      Because to say simple &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; as you put your propositions to one another will be
!2Ssimply a reiteration of the meeting we were at the last time we met in these offices.    We arc anxious that  such a meeting should not take place but that vie should see how  far we are meeting one another eye to eye to-day and reduce down as far as we possibly can the points in dispute;    then when we get to that it will be time to get to more finality than we are getting at at the present time.      That is our object in meeting you people to-day, Mr.. Chairman.THE CHAIRMAN:      I think it is quite olear, Mr, Smith, that there was no reluctance at all on pur part in meeting you here to-day.    We have a situation to face which must obviously be dealt with; the collieries must be got to work at some time; and I think there must be general agreement upon this point, that the sooner they get to work the better.    I suppose on both sides it can be said the time at v,&apos;hicb they will get to work will depend upon terms being arranged upon which the Owners can open their collieries and upon which the Men are prepared to accept employment at the collieries.We rather welcome the opportunity y ou have afforded us to-day in order that we may clear the ground  and see exactly where we stand on both sides.    I do not think there should be any difficulty in your letting us know exactly what your attitude is at the present moment towards the questions which have been debated between us in the past which are still calling for settlement, and we should have no objection, in fact we are very anxious that you should know exactly what our views are in regard to the whole position.      You have told us,  in terms of a very general character, why you have asked to meet us to-day;  but I think we should; make more progress and arrive at some definite understanding -or definite want of understanding - so that where may be no question at all in the minds of either side here as to
the situation that has to he faced;  and I think we should he glad if you could let us Icbow what your views are upon the questions which ariso in this dispute and which will have to he settled in some form or other, before there is a resumption in the industry,  of the character that I hope we both want,You have touched very briefly upon one question, and that is the question of wages.    I think you must be aware that wages in the industry depend upon the circumstances and con-ditions in which the industry is carried on; and the wages payable are inseparable from those conditions and depend entirely upon the  circumstances in which the earning of the wages is possible.I think we could make more progress if you would let us know, with as much precision os you can, what your attitude is towards the vari ous questions which have been the subject of discussion between us and generally in the country since we last met before the stoppage.MR. BE3EBHT SMITH:      Is that one of the best modes of procedure that is in your mind, that we should get straight to the point of the bayonet at once;    because&apos; if it is, that is where probably we shall end rather abruptly.What I would like to get to know is, what is the change in the position,  if any,  as far as you people are concerned; becauBo there must be a change in the character of this thing.    Some people tell us that we have lost all the trade of the country.    That I do not believe;    that is the first thing I disbelieve-    The second thing is,  that anyone who is supplying coal to this country is supplying on long-term contract - again, not correct.    There must be a better outlook inland at least than there was at the time of the stoppage because stocks,   etc., have largely g cue.    It is true that some of you people have started to work outcrop mines,
the Royalty Owners and Colliery Owners and all.    It is also time that there have been attempts in other directions to get coal from other countries, which have been pertly &quot; successful,  but it has never been able to get to the position,  and I an thankful it has not, that we should be caterers of that.     because I think we have made it quite clear as far as we are concerned that whatever negotiations we have we want them of a national character.    That is the first thing we are  clear on;    we ought to have no side-tracking in that at all;    we must look at this from a national point of view.As to hours.    I have already &quot;said that has been dealt with in another place.    It cannot be legally enforced except by contract of service;  and I think I ought to say to you people as kindly as I possibly can that we have no idea in our minds of an extension of hours, if that is what you people are wanting to get.As to the genora&quot;l inquiry into wages, on that rests a lot of things.    Some of your people treat it lightly - you have a perfect right to your opinions like anyone else.    The question of mines and reorganisations and methods, etc., needs some investigation.    We realise this - I do not want to take you people in or try to take you in at all; when we have dealt with you people,  as far as we possibly could deal with you,  in this you have another outlook now from what you had.   We have to seek some assistance for a time from the Government of this country - I think we are bound to have to face that.     Wo shall probably be told by you people that the mines are not in as good a condition;  I am not going to say they all are;    but I challenge anyone,, as far as we have had control, to prove that we have helped to get them ou    of condition;
we have rather helped to. keep them in condition.    I and 4:colleagues have not  objected to doing a shift or two &quot;anabut,   on the  other hand, it is true that the safety men&apos;s position has been abused by you people in many instances. What we understood the safety men wore for was to keep the mines safe; and the men who did safety work before the 30th April and did it after the 30th April would keep those mines in their proper condition.      That has not been carried out -I speak for my owm county more than anything else - by 40 per cent,  of the collieries.    It is bad to have to admit a thing like this,  that we cannot play straight with one another even in a dispute of this character0     Because any student who vas a student in 1921 and who did not  learn something from the difficulties of 1981 is not  fit to  carry on very far;  but if people take advantage of those offers, When they will turn the other side of their dispositions - u thing we have tried to put down as far as we could-.things we can agree on, how many things are left in dls-agreeinent&apos; and how we can face them.    That is. what we suggest to you again.    I said it kindly so that we do not make definite statements and you do not make definite statements, and simply part like that; because the country is looking to us - as it has a perfect right to look to us - to see if some solution cannot be found of this business 0    It has been suggested-,  and I do not know that I would object particularly,  that if four of us - two from each side - were taken out  of it, the thing; would be settled.    Personally I would  not mind taking a long trip if I were one of those four.      The people who talk like that are talking without their hair on.    I seek to get thingsksettled on honest lines; my history is on record and can&apos;be turned up;  but I am not one of those men who are seekingpeace at any price - that is the other side of it,  and I7.going down the gob fires,  and so on,  and facing the position.].I say the discussion ought to be on how1 many
want that to he understood.      I want us to have a friendly talk this afternoon on general questions, and,  M need be, take to-morrow and get to important questions when we have cleared these for    If I were talking at the mine I should say that the first thing is to get my gate end properly packed up and timbered and then go right and left.      let us get to the face.    let us got the  roads put in proper repair and then see ho?/ much more wants removing after we get there. If we make definite statements, you people in reply will probably make definite instatements to us, and then the matter ends.   We had &quot;better go a bit further and see how far we can reduce it.    Many efforts have been used;    I think everyone can say that.    I have been told that negotiations have been going on that we knew nothing about.    Then the- Chairman has mentioned our &quot;ecclesiastical associations&quot;; what I will say to that is this, that as far as I have dealt with those people in this business they have been as straight with me as I have been with them-o      I v/ill give them credit for that.But what I was saying was that there have been many attempts in many directions;  and I think we have said! on both sides  during these 111 clays that we do not see any hopes of a settlement as far as the Owners and the Workmen are concerned, and now is the chance to see whether we can come near a settlement so that,  if needs be, we can go to a third party and see what assistance they can give us until we can turn round - and that is what I am after today along with my sides
THE CIIAIRLiAN;      I think there can be no doubt, Mr. Smith as to what our view is with regard to the people who must make a settlement of this dispute.      In our view, it is the owners of the collieries and the respresentatives of the men who work at the collieries,      We have never had any faith in princes or in governments - whether they are princes of the Church or whether they are ppSnces of another kind - as far as industrial questions are concerned; and no settlement can possibly be as good as a settlement which is made between the people who are engaged in the industry.Now, we feel this afternoon that we ought to be perfectly clear and candid with each other.      There are certain questions to which you have alluded upon which, in our opinion, it is absolutely necessary that there should be a clear definition of our position.     We do not want to digress on to questions of what the safety men have been doing;    I do not suppose many of us here have any knowledge of what they have been doing.     We are quite prepared to say at once that your attitude in the districts towards the maintenance of the collieries in a condition in which your men can go back to work in them,  when they are ready to go, has been unobjectionable as far as we are concerned,      I pay you the tribute of saying that you have felt,  as we have felt, that if there is any destruction of any kind done to the mines I do not mean by that wilful destruction by neglect or want of attention -- your men would probably be greater sufferers in the long run,  or,  perhaps,  even quicker than any others.      I will say at once that you have done,  as far as we know,  what-every sensible man would do in regard to the means of his own livelihood,      Any action other than that would be simply destructive of the very means by which your people hope to gain their livelihood and we hope to carry on our own business. So I do not think we need take up anv time in discussing
or dealing at all with the question as to.whether there ha3 been anything done which,  In your opinion,  ought not to have been done,  or whether there has been any agreement that has been violated. --- whether there has been, indeed, any agreement in existence to be violated.     The position is far too serious, in our opinion, to take up time in talking round it.If we are to get into our minds  on each side exactly where we stand,  we feel that it is absolutely necessary that we should be told mutually what our attitude is torfards the Industry.     We do not think that we would be serving the best interests of the industry,  or of the country,  if we were to take up time in talking in generalities or in order to give the impression that we had got together and were proceeding to carry on negotiations which might or might not result in a settlement.     We think It is far better that we should know definitely our views on each side upon certain main questions which,  after all, have  to be cleared out of the way before any questions of detail can be dealt with at all.     And I hope you do not mean it,  Mr.Smith, when you say that you regard our view, our expression of opinion, that we should be clear and precise and definite with each other,  as putting either side at the point of the bayonet.     We are as anxious as you are, as I have said before, to get an early settlement, and those who can make a settlemnet ought to be put in a position as soon as possible to deal with the questions which call for attention.I do not know whether it was your desire that we should infer from what yea said that on one fundamental question, in our opinion, your view is still what you have expressed in no uncertain terms from the very beginning - that is, in regard to the question of hours. Taken literally, your -emark would admit probably of no other construction than that you on your side rule the question of hours as being outside the scope of
J. sis 3discussion between us.      &apos;7ell, now, that, as I have said, is a question which to our minds is absolutely fundamental, and it would be wrong if anything were said which wouin give you the impression that in our view the Act of Parliament which has been passed is to be treated as a dead, letter and as if it had not been placed upon the Statute Book.The question of wages that can be paid in this or any other industry, as far as I know, must depend, upon the amount of work that is-done by the wage earner;   and, as we have said over and over again for some considerable time-, there Is no possibility that we can see of the industry being carried on, even if It were only for the payment of mages; without taking full advantage of the fact that now It is no longer a crime to work more than 7 hours a day, as It has been up to the time of the passing of this Act.       We have strenuously held that view and expressed it to you;    and quite candidly and openly we have exerted ourselves to the fullest extent possible to persuade the Government of this country, through the Cabinet and the Houses of Parliament,  that it was absolutely essential that the prohibition which existed to working more than 7 hours a day should be removed, and that it should be legal to work 8 hours a day in the mines.     That is a view which is held by coalowners throughout the country.     And whatever means may be employed to discuss terms of&apos;employment &amp;v of discussing wages that may be payable by the collieries in the country,  that Act has to be taken into full and complete consideration as being intended to be implemented by the Owners and the country.Now, another question upon which you have touched and upon which you have given an expression of opinion is the question of assistance to the Industry froei outside the industry-11-
to enable it to pay wages to the men in excess of its own capacity.     Whether it be for a short time or for a long time, there Is no question at all as to our attitude towards that. It is and always has been averse to interference by the Government even In the direction of providing public money for the purpose of increasing the wages of those engaged In the industry above that which the Industry can afford to pay.So that on those two points, which are applicable generally to the industry as a whole, it would appear that the views &quot;which you have expressed, if the:/ represent the views of the miners in the country, are entirely opposed to those which we hold. I do not know whether these are general questions of the kind that you would like to say something more upon before we proceed any further.     I think you will agree that,  after all, it is better that we should be quite frank and candid with each other and not use words for the purpose of taking up tim   or of giving any sort of appearance of our -- I will not say pretending, because it would be quite wrong of me to suggest such a thing   but to appear that we were entering upon negotiations without a clear understanding between ourselves, or of giving the appearance that we were entering upon negotiations at all when fundamental differences exist which make negotiation difficult, if not impossible,  when views so divergent are held upon these questions of capital importance as far as the working of the industry is concerned,MR. HERBERT SMITH:    You had better touch upon the third question ---    you have touched, upon two the national aggreement.THE CHAIRMAN:    On the third point I want to   ;e as clear and as definite as I hope I have been on the other two points.      You have indicated very definitely,  and I think you have placed it in the forefront of the points with -which you dealt,  that you are prepared to enter upon national negotiations for the purpose of making a National Agreement,  and. that that is the only method
I.   3which at present you are prepared to adopt.In dealing with this point I think we have got to consider what is the situation In the industry at the present time *      It is a situation which affects the whole of the conditions under which &quot;work is possible to be carried on in the industry,  and which,  to our minds, reflects the way in which terms for a resumption of work can be arrived at. The condition of the industry has been made known to you periodically month by month for some years;    and there can&apos; be no doubt in your minds that the state of the coal trade for the last year or more up to the time of the stoppage, in fact ever since the effect of the occupation of the Ruhr by France disappeared,  has been an entirely hopeless one. The costs of production have been in excess, generally speaking,  of the price at which the coal could be sold;    and the one essential,  to our minds, to a restoration   I will not say of prosperity;    one is not looking for that just for the moment, but of the possibility of conducting the i^a.\3try       is a substantial reduction in the cost of production of coal.      That Is indispensable;    and we have always indicated the extension of the working day as the one concrete,  substantial means by which a great deal of that could be achieved.      The extent to which reductions in the cost of production are absolutely necessary, as you will have seen from the figures,  varies largely froiri district to district.      In some districts, particularly those which are engaged In the export trade,  the situation has been for some time desperate.     While the Government subsidy in aid of wages was payable and the costs of prod-action to the Owners directly were reduced,  It was  shown that it was possible for us to regain the trade which we had previously lost.     The world prices of coal dominate that situation absolutely.
There is an impression that coal was being sold abroad at lower prices by this country than they ought to hive been or should have been;    that Continental prices were being reduced below a figure at which they otherwise mould have remained, from the fact that wo in this country were reducing our prices for coal.      I think there is no doubt that an examination of the actual position will demonstrate that, even when the competition of British coal has been removed, our Continental competitors have continued to sell coal at the prices at which they were selling before, and have made long contracts at prices even below those which were current up to the end of April,     So that as far as those districts which depend upon the export of coal for their operations are concerned, the future does not hold a better prospect; indeed, it is to be feared that it holds a worse prospect, as far as price is concerned,, than existed in the first four months of this year;    and, while there are differences of considerable magnitude between one exporting district and another   differences which will have to be mat and dealt with before there can be any restoration of work in those districts -- it is true to say,  as you yourselves will have seen from the R turns,  that they as a class are  worse off than the inland districts have been.-You have said,  Mr. Smith,  that the depletion of stocks will create a demand, .at any rate for the home market, which will put up prices when a resumption of work takes place. That is a view which we do not share.      The big coal-consuming industries in this country,  who,  after all,  are the backbone of the industry, have got to re-start;    and it is a matter of impossibility as far as they are concerned that they can consume and take in coal at the rate at which it will be, produced at the collieries when a resumption of work takes place.
As far as the essential industries of the country are concerned,  they are being kept going at the present moment by foreign coal.     When I referred to the essential industries I was using a phrase which was wrong;   because what I meant was the essential services of the country, not the essential industries.     The class of consumer that I spoke of before was more like the iron and steel and the like industries;    but the public services of the country are being kept going by foreign coal,  and provision has to be made by those who buy the foreign coal off the Government   who see that it comes in       some time in advance:    and there is an absolute certainty that when resumption takes place at the collieries there will be in the country a very large stock of foreign coal which will haw? to be used in some way or other and which will be In competition with the coal that will be raised at the collieries.      So that there is no pros-pect, as far as we can see,  of anything taking place which will give anything at all, much less anything substantial,  in the way of increased demand and increased price when work Is resumed;    and anyone who bases any calculations as to what the industry Ih the different districts can afford to pay upon that assumption is,  I think,  founding them on a very shaky and unstable base.Now,  the condition of the industry at the end of April was thoroughly bad.     The condition to-day,  as far as the ability of the Owners to pay/ Is concerns ,  Is very much worse.     The financial position of very owner in the country h;-s been reduced very materially.      The cost of the mainten-ance of the collieries is a very heavy one and has had to be borne by the owners;    and such differences as existed between district and district at the end of April have been greatly accentuated by this time;    and there are problems which call for attention and which will have to be solved before a
resumption on a proper basis can take place in each, district,  different in one district from another, which, to our mind,  can only be dealt with by those who know the circumstances in the districts.     And,  further, the wages which can be paid in the districts to a considerable extent depend upon the solution of the difficulties and the adjustment of conditions peculiar to those districts --different in degree, and not only in degree but actuall?/ in kind       which,  to our minds, make It a matter of complete impracticability in so far as dealing with them on. any basis other than a purely district basis is concerned.The owners of the collieries In the districts know what those problems are;    they vary from pit to put in a dis-trict;    and there is no possibility of those variations in the difficulties in the districts being dealt with except by those who know them and know them intimately       by those who are concerned in the settlement of them as affecting themselves.The position that we are in as Owners in the county to-day   -- I want to be perfectly clear and definite upon this so that there may be no misapprehension as to what  the attitude of the Owners is upon that       the position of the Coalowners is that they insist upon dealing with these matters themselves within their districts, and they are not prepared to allow them to bo dealt with except by the people who know them and are directly affected, by them,-16-
11 q1 t! *xYou will have gathered from what I have said that our attitude in regard to that point which you dealt with first and foremost, and to which, perhaps, you seemed   I may be wrong;    I hope I am --   to attach the greatest importance. Is fundamentally opposed to yours.     We have had National Agreements for the last five years.      Quite apart from the particular aspect of it to which I have alluded before, there does not seem to us to be any advantage to the industry,  to the men employed In the Industry, to the other Industries of the country, and to the country as a whole, which is associated with agreements made on a national basis. National Agreements have not brought prosperity to the industry,    and, to our minds, by their very nature they are precluded from doing justice to the industry in detail   and,  after all., It Is the industry in detail that has to be considered, and It Is the collieries taken one by one together that constitute the industry. The effect has been that instead of improving the position throughout the industry,  we are convinced, from the exper-ience that we have had,  that arrangements on a national basis made here in London and rigidly applied throughout the country ai^e deleterious and detrimental to the true interests of the workmen and the owners who constitute the industry;    and,,  as I have said,  to the other industries of the country and to the country as a whole.As I have said,  I wanted to be perfectly frank and candid with you so as to leave no doubt in your minds as to what our attitude is towards the means which must be adopted for getting these questions settle d and a resumption of work brought about at the collieries. The District Associations of Coalowners have indicated-17-
the terms upon which the collieries are open for work. They are prepared to meet the representatives of the men in the districts to discuss those terms as soon as ever they can get the opportunity;    but they are not prepared   they have spoken with no uncertain, voice -- to allow the terms and conditions upon which their pits are to be opened in their districts to be discussed by any other than their own direct representatives who meet themrepresentatives of the men within their own districts.I have been perfectly frank, Mr. Smith,  and possibly you will say I have been brutally frank;    but It would not have been honest of me if I had allowed discussion to con-tinue in general terms without coming down to the fundamental points which have to be settled, and created the impression that a settlement of tb-is question can be arrived at by discussions held here in London between, your Executive and a body representing the coalowners throughout the country.     You will forgive me If I have been brutal, but I have tried to put to you quite clearly, without any equivocation at all, what is the position which we occupy/ to-day.      We have felt grateful to you for giving us  the opportunity to-day of making the position clear so that we may know exactly where we stand, with regard to the course which we are prepared, as Owners In the districts, to follow,  to try and bring about a settlement of this question on terms upon which the industry can con-tinue.      Unless we can get a sound,  economic settlement of this question district by district,,  we feel that this in-dustry is doomed, and. not only this industry/ but the whole country and all the other industries in it.
MR. HERBERT SMITH;      Gould we nut sum it up like this, Mrc  Chair--itian, that the terms you have put down are your terms and your terms only?    That is how ws ought to sum it up.      We have not got there yet;    I want to make that perfectly clear0     Ws have been 111 days and gotten to where we have gotten to;    and if we are told here now that after 111 days those are the terms and those are the terms only, I can say in a very few words - we are not going to accept them.      But I intend following them home one by one;    because we have got some admissions that I thought we should get and that we should get to know where we really are,I want to put it that you have tried in your way -which I do not Intend accepting - to say that I put up so-and-so and so-and-so;. but you are the gentleman who has made the definite statements and must be father of&apos; them, and I will be father of the replies.      I know this,  that you have got a publication bureau here that you use. and if you use it you must use it truthfully as far as I am concerned, and I will use mine truthfully as far as you are concerned.-,The first thing you told us with regard to hours was that you exerted yourselves to persuade the Government, and. you exerted yourselves to persuade the country - I did not know you had exerted yourselves to persuade the country, but I knew you had exerted yourselves to persuade the House of Lords -----------THE CHAIRMAN.      I did not say the country,  I said &quot;The Hous es of Parliament&quot;.MR.  HERBERT SMITH.      Yes,  the Houses of Parliament,  to get an eight hours day, and you intended operating that0      Now 1st me say briefly, we do not intend operating it0      So we get clearly away at&quot; onee&quot;,  ---   there is one thing that I intend fighting.until my last time on- earth it is this, tEatT&quot;a*Ifi&quot;   &quot; not going back to an eight hours day;    I am not going back
to upset arrangements that have &quot;been in existence in Durham and Northumberland for over 60 years,  to put on to their days  I4- hours and lig hours in some places, and 2-J- hours and 2% hours in others.      No;    we have got to carry on.      So we are quite clear on that, that you are going to work it and we do not intend it being worked - an eight hours day.Now with regard to what you told us in connection with the position in the coal trade.      I say it is not an assumption that you have sold your coal cheap in foreigncountries;    it is tr,ue;    and the.foreign miners have not1forgotten from time to time to fell us    that their wages\have been reduced by the way we ha\ve gone into their markets01We have to remember that some of you people have interestshere and interests in Germanys      Vile have to watch this moye-ment very carefully.      Our friends will tell us, and your own figures prove it,  that the price at which coal was sentinto foreign countries was simply ridiculous, and we got n- -trade with itc      Your own ascertainments - I never acceptedyour figures because I never had a chance to scrutinise,   them - but the figures that come like that are fairlyuseful when they come in that direction.      We are told by  -France and Belgium and Germany that we were ousting them- even out of&quot; their own markets,  and we have some proof of ittoo - the price that you people were takingoAs to what I  said about the home trade.      I said there would be supplies to be got;    and when you tell us wehave to meet foreign coal in competition that will not bea big question if the price that is being paid now is any-thing like the price we have got to face;    because I sawsome stuff the other day which if - you people had been dealingwith.. \t at your-5d.tS.__you would have wanted to know whofilled it.     The price has been  2. 7s. 6d&quot;.&quot; en t&quot;orr-o-n-the-.....other-go-
side - not on this side - and it has to come across;    when it got to the place where it had to be delivered it was sold at 3s.  0du and 3s. 5d.  a hundredweight.      I saw a gentleman who had bought 20,000 tons and who paid 45s.  0d, a ton for it; so I am not bothering about that foreign coal.      I think that will soon go out as far as we are concerned.With regard to wages.      I have said,    and I say it again,  that we are not going to walk into a conference committed to a reduction in wap^es until we have discussed the policy that is before us, and the policy that you people have never faced yet.     You have trodden it lightly,.      So it seems to me this is only a sham meeting as far as you are concerned.      What you said on the 30th of April you sa7/ now - plus this,  &quot;We have persuaded the House of Commons11 - which is largely interested in mining and the employment of labour - &quot;to put on the Statute Book an Eight, Hours Day Act&quot; - without any consultation of the nation at large;    and you say,  &quot;We intend that being worked.&quot;     That is what we have received from you to-day.I now come to National Agreements.      I remember, Mr,Chairman, a big conflict taking place in 1893, and there are afew people here now who were here then, on your side as wellas ours - I remember out of that dispute another time when theOwners gave us notice and Conciliation Board areas were formedand it Is marvellous that people to-day who are here - I donot mean you personally but who authorise you to make this statement - said at that time,  &quot;What we have got to do is toget hung on to these people such a district and such a district and&quot;such a. district, and it will ultimately reduce these men&apos;swages in theso other cTIstrlctsB- But to-day you turn roundand say quite the opposite to that. .   You say thrt there is noone knows their own districts better than those who are in them.      It is surprising to me, when I meet some of you people-21-
about your own districts, how little you know about them.    I am talking about fundamental principles now.   When the Chairman says, &quot;We have not been down to see&quot;, you ought to go down to see and then you will know.I want to say that if your answer from your people is that, first, we havo got to work en eight hours day;  and, second, we have got to have District Agreements: and, third, without any inquiry ais all we have to have a reduction in wages - I will say to you this afternoon,  &quot;Good afternoon; we have met you; we are parting again until you people think otherwise,&quot;     That will be simply my reply,  because if anything has been brutal this has been brutal - after all these days to meet here and then to be told we have to have this,  and the other wo oannot.       We are not beaten yet - do get it into your minds that we are.    Some of us have made an offer - whether you believe it or not,  a sincere offer -to be able to get together in this direction.     Would to God I had not made it now , as A* as I am concerned;    because it is wrong.    If 2 have to meet you people and yau say, &quot;This is it, and nothing else&quot;, I want to say on behalf of myself and my colleagues that we do not intend having itoTHE CHAIBMAI:     Well, Mr.  Smith, I do not know thct I have a great deal to say in reply to what you have said. There is one correction I would like to make, though, in some remarks which you have made, that the offers that we have put before you in the various districts are now put by me as be in the terms and the only terms upon which work can be resumed. I never intended to say such a thing,  amd I do not think I did.     1 intended to make it quite clear to you that the question of the district terms could be discussed only in the districts;    they can be discussed in the districts, and the Owners are prepared to meet---------
HIMR. COOK:      It is the same thing,MR. HERBERT SMITH:    I am rising on a point of order.    Do not let us quibble on words.   We were talking about District Agreements all the time and not conditions.     You said that we have to have District Agreements;    I say we have not - that is the other side of it.    As to conditions we need not quibble.,THE CHAIRMAN:      You see,  it is rather surprising to me that you should have taken up the attitude that you have of accusing us of putting forward terms, sticking to them, and making no change in our position from, the 30th of April after ; that has taken place.     We were urged, we always have been urged, by you, when making offers, not to make a bargaining offer;    go the full length you can;    and I can assure you that it was in that spirit that the districts considered the whole of this question.      I am not going to make any reference to any district terms in any way at all because it is beyond my province; and when one wants to negotiate to bring about a settlement it is always wiser to negotiato with those who have the power to deal with the questions than to try to carry on discussions with people who say frankly that they have no power to deal with the settlement of those questions that have arisen.I want to be perfectly straight, and I am prepared to accept the construction,  in principle, which you put upon my remarks.,    I myself did allude to them as being put to you brutally - by that I mean without  any equivocation and with a&apos;sincere desire to leave no doubt in your minds as to what our attitude was.    So that on the question of hours in general I am not going to repeat what I said; but I do say this again,  and there can be no question of this, that there is no future for this industry in this country nor for the other industries in this country except by the putting intoP,3.
operation of an Act which Parliament placed on the Statute Book last Session;  and as far as discussions of the terms and conditions upon which work can he resumed are concerned, I say again that the districts are prepared to discuss thorn, and they are not prepared to allow this tody on our side here to take up for them the discussions in any sense at all in regard to them.MB.  COOK:      Do I understand , Mr.  Ch airman .*.......?THE CHAIRMAN:      I just wanted to say this,    I think it is rather beside the mark to accuse us of saying, &quot;This is what we must have and that is what we must have&quot;, when your position all the time has been that there were certain things that you would not have on any account; and even to-day you say there is one thing which we consider fundamental but which you will not have, and there is another thing which we consider equally fundamental which you say you will have but which wo are not prepared to accept.      So that there are differences between us upon two points which are absolutely vital to the whole issue.We have not really any standing, therefore,  as two bodies for negotiating a settlement  of this question;  and I . say&apos;again that if you want a settlement - I believe you dc want a settlement - the quickest and the wisest and tho best way of doing it is to deal ?/ith those who have the power to make the settlement.ME- HERBERT SMITH:      I want to suggest to you that we do not want your advice at all as to what we should do.    Wo tell you distinctly that we are standing for seven hours; we are standing for a Rational Agreement; we are prepared to peruse reorganisation, etc., to sec what can be done to relieve^ any reduction that Is likely to come along.    We told you, further, wo should make an application to a party outside of here,  and I think wo are  justified in making that application,
We were restricted during the vJ&quot;ar.      They took certain money out of the industry;    they and your people are responsible for where we are, and we say they have a right to get us out of this position as mildly as we possibly can.     We have not said we may not ultimately have to face a reduction of wages;   but we have said there are various things to be done, and must be done, and pledges given on this;   because we have known you long enough to know that unless we- do get it definitely we shall not get it  at   all.      Consequently we want that Inquiry to take plsce.It has been said, and boomed as far as you are concerned, that an amalgamation has taken place in Yorkshire.     I knew about that three years ago.      It was not the Commission which brought that about;    it has been evolution.     After wasting money,  they amalgamated to try and make it better.That is where we stood, and that is where we are;    so that offers in the districts do not appeal to us at all.MR, COOK:    May I say that I remember last time you sent to us and we met you;    this time we sent to you -- not with the object as we were afraid your object was, to put it mildly, for propaganda purposes ---------THE CHAIRMAN:    I deny that absolutely.MR,  COOK:    I will accept that,        But we sent to you for the purpose of genuinely seeking a means whereby we could get an agreement between us.     You, have admittedly been brutal.     You have at one time told, us you accepted this Report ---------THE CHAIRMAN:    Put It in this way -- brutally frank.MR.  COOK:    You shall have that word added.     You said before that you accepted this Report.      You have now told us that you absolutely reject that Report   every word . n regard to hours and district settlements       and your statement is  clear without doubt.      You are quite right,  there can be no doubt in
the minds of any one- of us;    no doubt whatever;   your statement is that you refuse to negotiate with the National Miners&apos; Executive for a National Agreement.Our Chairman asked you in his opening remarks that we should find out our agreements, see what we could agree upon, and then, after dlsoussin the matter,  find our differences and see whether they could be reconciled.     Do you say that that was hard and fast?   That was the statement of our Chairman, without giving anything away.     You at once in your reply closed the door and. said &quot;No, we will not discuss a National Agreement with you;   we will not negotiate with you nationally.&quot;Proposals have been placed in the districts at the pit-heads where proposals have been seriously considered by the districts concerned, or the Coalowners In those districts,  as the maximum amount --- I gather from you that you meant that?TIE: CHAIRMAN:    You must not put words into my mouth that I did not use.MR.  COOK:    You said that we had asked ttou to give the maximum amount of any terms that you put forward.     There can be no misunderstanding whatever.      Anyone who speaks from our side would be repating himself;    but every/- one   of us will endorse the words of our President that you yourselves are not prepared for a peaceful solution or a National Agreement but are going to operate the Sight Hours Day Act at all costs, and are prepared to fight us to the bitter end on that,.THE CHAIRMAN:    Mr.Smith,  I think we haye been equally frank on both sides.      You say you will not have anything to do with eight hours and that you must have a national settle-ment;    we on the other hand say that we have n   power or authority to discuss with you a national settlement, and we are therefore   /
precluded,  by the unanimous voice of our- constituents., from s- ^dealing with it.      If we were to carry on conversations and discussions in the direction of dealing with terms and con-ditions of employment it would be dishonest on our partbecause we should be doing that which we have no authority or power to do,I think there can be no doubt at all that that isthe position which we hold;    and while we differ in this wayon these fundamental points it does not seem to me that anyprolonginggood purpose can be served by our     / &apos; this meeting ormeeting again as two national bodies,  in this way.     We areas desirous as you are of obtaining a peaceful settlement ----MR. THOMAS RICHARDS:        Do not say that.THE CHAIRMAN:      at the earliest possible opportunity;    and we are convinced that the only way in which a peaceful and lasting settlement in this industry can be arrived at is by dealing with them not on a national basis but on the basis of the District Associations with egypt.e representatives of the Miners1 Federation in those districts..MR. HERBERT SMITH:      Is this rather fair to me?    I thought you had replied to me once.,      Do not reply a second time because you cause me to get up again0THE CHAIRMAN.:      I had a sort of idea that the Chairman was expected to wind up.MR. HERBERT SMITH:      He has a sort of idea he has a right to reply, but he has no right to a double reply.      I do not intend to be out-manoeuvred by you.     You misquoted in what you said to start with that we said we would have nothing to do with District Agreements0      We said we did not intend to increase our working day;    we made that clear to you,      We saicTTae &quot;were --p-r6pa*ed--tQ.J,nquire into the particular point, utilise it to the best advantage, t .1 do all we possibly can&quot; to save our own faces if we have to have reductions, and
-ask the Government to play their parts      It is no goodsaying you are anxious to get a settlement:    If you ask Moto say the truth,  I do not think you are.      I intendputting a hit more fight into this than I have done;    Ihave to do it whether I want to do it or noto      I get noyounger, but I will fight on.while there is a bit leftof me..      If there is a feeling that you are the only persons on earth and we have to do this and that,  I want tosay I have not been bred that road,     A fair deal I will put up with, but I will not have it crammed down me - thatI will resisto     Good afternoon.-,(The proceedings then terminated.) ,-,-----ooo---------
