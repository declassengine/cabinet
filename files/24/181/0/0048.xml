[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&quot;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1926........... q,SECRET. Copy No.  M&apos;CP. 348 (26).CABINET.RUBBER EXPORTS RESTRICTION.Circulated bv the Secretary op State for the Colonies.IN April last my colleagues had before them a memorandum (OP. 149 (26)) in regard to the position of the Rubber Exports Restriction Scheme in Ceylon and Malaya. The proposals in that memorandum were somewhat modified in agreement with those of my colleagues who were principally interested, and the position arising at the end of the present month is that the exportable percentage of rubber from those territories will be reduced from 100 per cent, of standard production to 80 per cent, if, as seems fairly certain, the average price of rubber is less than Is. 9d. a lb. for the three months ending the 31st October.It is necessary to announce not later than on that date the regulations which are to come into force for the future operation of the scheme.I have received urgent representations that what is required by every interest affected is that any new regulations shall have the effect of working automatically according to the price of rubber in London, so that it may be open to anyone interested to judge for himself as far ahead as possible what degree of restriction is likely to be put into force from time to time. I notice that this view has been put strongly in the press.My Advisory Committee, now under the chairmanship of Sir Matthew Nathan, G.C.M.G., have put forward a scheme, which forms the basis of the proposals which I now have in mind, and which, with my colleagues&apos; concurrence, I will authorise to be brought into operation on the 1st November in Ceylon and Malaya. I attach a draft of the statement which, will be issued to the press before the end of the present month together with the details of the new regulations.It has been suggested in some quarters that the accumulation of export rights which are held by planters and merchants in the restriction areas as a result of their saving up part of their export allowances for use in exporting rubber at some future date, or possibly as the result of over-assessment, should be cancelled. These &quot;rights&quot; take the form either of coupons or of ledger credits and have not hitherto been valid only for a limited period. The effect of the existence of rights to export some 40,000 tons of rubber is of course to weaken to some extent the control of exports as exercised by reducing the exportable percentage figure, but after careful consideration I am satisfied that the cancellation of existing rights would be a breach of faith. I do, however, propose, if the Governments in Ceylon and Malaya see no insuperable objection, to take the line that rights acquired in future will be valid only for a definite period. I am still in communication with those Governments in regard to the details of this proposal, and it will be necessary to give them some discretion as to the date on which it can be made effective.L. S. A.Colonial Office, October 14, 1926.Draft Notice for the Press.As from the 1st November, 1926, the export of rubber from Ceylon and Malaya will be subject to the following regulations.   It is not contemplated that any change shall be made in these regulations for a period of twelve months at least, but if it is [15182]
decided at the end of t&amp;afc - time &apos;tfe &quot;continue-the- fempoir&apos;aay&quot;policy of restriction for a further period, any changes in the regulations which may then be considered^desirable may be made.Regulations.1. If the average price of rubber in London is less than Is. 9d. a lb., but not less than Is. 3d. a lb., during any quarter, the percentage of standard production which may be exported at the minimum rate of duty for the ensuing quarter will be reduced by 10.If, however, the reduction to be effected under this regulation is a reduction from a figure of 100 per cent., the reduced percentage for the ensuing quarter will be 80.2. If such average price for any quarter is not less than Is. Qd. a lb., but less than 2s. a lb., there will be no change in the percentage for the ensuing quarter.If, however, in each of two consecutive quarters .such average price is not less than Is. 9d. a lb., the percentage for the ensuing quarter will be increased;i   by 10.  . .:     &apos;3- If Buch average price for any quarter is 2s. a lb., or over, the percentage will be increased by 10 for the ensuing quarter.If, however, the increase to be effected under this regulation is an increase from a figure of 80 per cent., the increased percentage for the ensuing quarter .: will be 100. ...... ?4. If such average price is below Is. 3d. a.lb. in any quarter, the.percentage will be reduced to 60 for the ensuing quarter. , - ,,5. If such average price is over 3s. a lb. in any quarter, the percentage will be increased to 100 for the ensuing quarter. . .6. In no case will the percentage be increased above a figure of 100 or below a figure of 60,
