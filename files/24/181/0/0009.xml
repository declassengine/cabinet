[ThisPi^HiHlLj-i J*?^ rPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1926.SECRET. Copy No.   3(CP. 309 (26).CABINET.AGRICULTURAL TRAINING.Extract from the/Minutes of the TWENTIETH Meeting of the Committee of Civil Research held on Thursday, July 29, 1926, at 12*15 p.m.(Circulated by direction of the Chairman, Committee of Civil Research.) ***,*&apos;* *1. REPORT OF SUB-COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURAL TRAINING.THE Committee had before them the Report of the Sub-Committee on Agricultnltural Training (OR. (C) 17). The Sub-Committee summarise their recommendations as follows :-(1.) As regards the training of adults for oversea settlement [a.) That there should be largely increased provision for training ofadults from the towns for oversea settlement. (6.) That the training so provided should be carried out at trainingcentres specially established for the purpose.(2.) As regards the training of juveniles for employment in Great Britain (a.) That, owing to the difficulty of securing suitable employment, the State would not be justified in instituting training centres for town boys intending to remain in this country.(&amp;.) That this class of training could better be afforded through the medium of voluntary agencies which should be encouraged in this work by the payment of a small Government grant.(3.) As regards the training of juveniles for oversea settlement (a.) That agricultural training of town boys for oversea settlement should be carried out at special centres provided either directly by the Government or through recognised voluntary agencies.(p.) That owing to the practical difficulties involved, the State should not attempt to place out boys with farmers for instruction, but that grants might be made from public funds in exceptional cases to recognised voluntary agencies for this class of training.(4.) As regards the character of training centres for oversea settlement (a.) That training should be undertaken directly by the Government through the Ministry of Labour, or in favourable circumstances by approved voluntary agencies,under Government supervision.(b.) That in the first instance training should consist of a four months&apos; course, but that the position should be reviewed from time to time[14898]
to see whether it would be possible to reduce the period of training without detriment to its efficiency, (c.) That in order to secure the closest co-operation between the Ministry .; of Labour and the Dominions Office, the Director of Training atthe Ministry should be appointed a member of the Oversea Settlement Committee.(5.) As regards miners permanently displaced from the coal industry (a.) That training should be provided for miners, permanently displaced from employment on account of the crisis in the coal industry, (i) for oversea settlement, and (ii) as small holders in this country. (&amp;.) That training of miners for (a) (ii) above, although in the first instance undertaken on a modest scale, should be regarded as an integral part of any scheme for dealing with the settlement of displaced miners.(c.) That special financial provision for the settlement of miners in this country, recommended above, should be made in addition to any sums that may be available for existing or contemplated schemes of a general character for land settlement in Great Britain.(6.) As regards the training of women That where men with wives and other female dependents are accepted for training for oversea settlement, provision should be made for courses of instruction to be given in (a) housekeeping under Dominion conditions and plain cooking, and (b) simple agricultural work.(7.) As regards the numbers to be trained That arrangements should be made as soon as possible for the training and accommodation of a minimum of 10,000 additional persons, adult and juvenile, per annum for oversea settlement, at an estimated capital cost of  500,000 (i.e.,  50,000 per centre), and a recurrent annual expenditure of  420,000 (*.&apos;*.,  42,000 per centre).This proposal is subject to the Sub-Committee&apos;s recommendation that a further attempt should be made to perstiade the Dominions to contribute to the cost of training, and thereby set free the money which would then be available under the Empire Settlement Act. The Sub-Committee suggest that the full circumstances should be discussed, and the appeal made, at the Imperial Conference in the Autumn.THE CHAIRMAN drew attention to paragraph 11 of the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report on the relation of schemes for oversea settlement to those for work on the land in this country, and enquired whether the Sub-Committee&apos;s proposals for small holdings were so closely interlocked with those for oversea settlement that in the event of the former not being accepted by the Government the latter fell to the ground.LORD BLEDISLOE said that it was true that there had been a considerable number of failures among ex-service men who had been provided with small holdings during the last six years. He believed that this was primarily due to faulty selection and other causes. Small holders other than ex-service men had in the main done well, and their production per acre compared favourably, especially in Scotland, with that of large farms. Before the War failures among small holders did not exceed 5 per cent, of the whole.. The Sub-Committee had thought it important to obtain the support of leaders of working-class opinion, but their Report should not be entirely judged by paragraph 11, which in any case formed a small and relatively unimportant part of their recommendations.SIR ARTHUR STE E L-MA1TLAND agreed that it would be of advantage to secure the co-operation of the leaders of labour who would otherwise raise the political cry that the Governments migration schemes aimed at moving the unemployed out of this country where they could not hope to obtain a livelihood. Whether or not that support was obtained, he believed, however, that there would be no shortage of applications for training for oversea settlement. Indeed, the experience ot his Department at Claydon and Brandon showed that large numbers of unemployed would willingly avail themselves of the training offered, if further accommodation was provided.
SIR JOHN GILMOUR said that, so far as Scotland was concerned, it was true that the number of failures among small holders settled on good land in the Lowlands was comparatively small, and that these holdings showed an increased production per acre over that obtained on larger farms, but he was satisfied that a number of small holders who were still carrying on would not ultimately prove successful. It was true that there were some 10,000 applicants for small holdings on the waiting list in Scotland, but many of these had no capital at their disposal. It should be noted that every man provided&apos;with a small holding involved expenditure by the State of approximately o 500, even if he paid all the obligations he was asked to undertake.SIR GEORGE BARSTOW reminded the Committee that, since the war,  20 million had beeu spent by the State on the provision of small holdings for ex-service men, some 17,000 of whom had been settled in this country at an estimated loss to the State of between  .8 million and  9 million. During this period the provision of small holdings for country-bred men had been suspended, but the Small Holdings Bill now before Parliament proposed to make a start in providing small holdings for this class. In these circumstances it was difficult to see how small holdings could be allotted to town-bred men, as proposed by the Sub-Committee, in view of the long waiting-list of country-bred men whose claims had been deferred to those of ex-service men. As regards the Ministry of Labour centres, the Treasury had agreed in 1921 to the experimental establishment of centres at Claydon and Brandon, on the representations of the Minister of Labour, to meet the needs of young men who had been permanently unemployed after leaving school. The Sub-Committee had referred in their Report to the sum of  3 million provisionally ear-marked for assistance to the mining industry, and had suggested that it might in part be applied for the establishment of centres for training as smallholders miners permanently displaced from the coal industry and in part for an extension of training schemes for overseas similar to those at Claydon and Brandon. It should be noted that this sum of  3 million was the estimated balance of revenue over expenditure in the current financial year, and in view of the length of the coal strike it might not fully be realised. The Sub-Committee&apos;s proposals had been submitted to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who was not at present prepared to agree to any further allocation from this fund, a portion of which had already been ear-marked for research on coal problems by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Losses incurred on the piirchase of coal on Government Account during the strike would also form a charge upon it. There remained the recommendation by the Sub-Committee that 10,000 townspeople should be trained for oversea settlement. That was at present only possible under the Empire Settlement Act, which laid down that expenditure should be divided on a fifty /fifty basis between the British Government and the Dominion Governments. Funds available under that Act would not therefore be available unless the Dominions were willing to accept their share of the liability.Mr. ORMSBY GORE said that the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (who was unfortunately unable to be present at the meeting) was strongly in favour of the establishment of additional training centres similar to those at Claydon and Brandon. Oversea Settlement had been greatly assisted by the work of those centres, which were in fact invaluable. As regards the Empire Settlement Act, it was fair to say that training in this country was a new development not contemplated at the time when the Act was passed. Moreover, there was a widely held feeling that that Act had in large measure failed on account of the inelasticity of its financial provisions.SIR WARREN FISHER said that in his view the fifty/fifty basis prescribed by the Act was the principal safeguard of the British taxpayer against excessive expenditure. The possibility of balancing the Budget for next year was becoming increasingly difficult owing to the coal strike. The Sub-Committee^ recommendations involved large expenditure which called for careful thought in view of the financial position of the country. &quot;SIR ARTHUR STEEL-MAITLAND agreed that it would be impossible to override the provisions of the Empire Settlement Act. In his view the question was how far any expansion would be justified of the existing facilities for training. It was important in this connection to remember that if due regard was to be had to economy, it was impossible rapidly to secure and equip suitable sites for training centres. The conversion of empty country houses or disused country institutions was a far cheaper method than the erection of even the least expensive form of temporary buildings, but such houses or institutions were difficult to find. It was, moreover, difficult rapidly .to obtain or train efficient staff.   If therefore the Government were to decide on an
extension of training facilities he hoped that they would quickly do so, so that his Department might be in a position to start the preliminary enquiries. It would probably not be possible to open an additional centre within a year of the date upon which its establishment was approved.After further discussion, the Committee agreed-To recommend to the Cabinet that the question of the agricultural training of townspeople, dealt With in the Report of,the Sub-Committee (C.R. (C) 17), should be referred.for discussion at the Imperial Conference.&quot;it12, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, July 31, 1926.o
