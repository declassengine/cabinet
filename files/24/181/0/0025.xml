Goal Commission and Coalowners. H*10 Downing Street.    6th September,  1926.MR.  CUURCHIliL:      I cannot say  that we weresurprised to receive the answer which you. sent to our letterproposing the three-cornered conference, because we had before us your  statement at the meeting ten days ago withthe men and also the latter that you have been good enoughto write us telling us what your view is and the greatimportance y^u attach to it. But if the Government were notsurprised by the answer they are deeply concerned at itand we have various consio erati ona which w e should like toput before you,    The consideration which takes priority over everything else and whieh If established I am sure wouldweigh the most heavily in your minus is the question of on this point the general understanding&apos;,  the basis of understanding, Which has subsisted between His Majesty1 s Government and the Mining Association- during this long-*drawn and ^retracted dispute.MR. MV&apos;AN WILLIAMS :    Did you say. Miners or Mineowners? MR. CHURCHILLt    The Mining Association,How there&quot; are two quite distinct points which are habitually confused.    The first is this.    Assuming that there will continue to be, as there has been since 1921, a National Agreement dealing with certain aspects of the wage question and District Agreements dealing with others, what subjects are to be dealt with in each? In particular, is the minimum percentage to continue to find a place in the National Agreement, as the men claim,  or is it to be transferred to the District Agreements,  as the owners claim?   That is what I may call one . uestion..  That is the first question^     The second question is  this.    Is there tov.-bo any National Agreement at all or is the industry in future
to bo regulated purely by District Agreements without any National Wage Negotiating bodies?   That is the second, the alternative,   uestion.   Now up to the meeting between yourselves and the men on the 19th August the issue was Nosl, the issue ims the first of those questions.     On the 19th August, owing to your declaration, the issue became No.2; it became the second of those questions.    That is the point with which we are concerned at the present moment and that is the only ;;oint with which we   are conoexned at the present moment and it is very important that that point should not be obscured by being mixed up with the first and&apos; more complicated point,   let ma state what, in my judgment, is the issue across the table at the momenta It is, is there to be any National Agreement at all, or is the industry in future to be regulated purely by Diet riot Agreements without any National Wage negotiating body?   Now that is the only point to which I want to ash you to address yourselves this afternoon, as todetailsit is perfectly clear that there must be District Agreements, It is perfectly clear that this matter can never be settled in all its details of wages and hours by a conference in London-;    it has got to be settled in the districts, but the extent to which the District Agreements are related to a National structure, the extent to whioh national machinery on both sides is to be preserved, that is the issue before us at the present time.    Now I should like, if you will allow me, to make some quotations from your declarations in the past, Mr.Willi ms.     When this question first arose you argued before the Royal Commission that any form of National Agreement was wrong and that the industry ought to revert to the pre-war system of regulation by Distriot Agreements,
Well,  the Royal Commission did not accept  that view.    I am not  one of those who consider that  the Royal Commission Report is a sort of bible   ,  from which everything that is quoted is necessarily absolutely authoritative, because I think that would be putting its credentials too high, but still it is  the fact that y ou argued in that sense and the Royal Commission saici  on page 236 &quot;We consider it essential that there should be,  as there always have been hitherto, considerably variations in the rates of wages in the several districts, but we are strongly of the opinion that National Wage Agreements should continue.&quot;   Now in the face of this declaration the Mining Association withdrew from the position which they had taken up in giving evidence before the Commission and at your meeting with the men on the 51st March, you will permit me to quote your words, you said :-&quot;I say quite frankly  that we are making a sacrifice of our conviction, which is not a thing to  coast about or  to take any credit for, from that point of view    But we are not  going to stand on the ground whi h we have taken up in the past in regard to this matter, and we are   prepared, in order that we may get  on with the real  problem that faces us, to sit down with you an    to carry  on negotiations on a national basis, upon general principles,  and upon such things as are &quot;f general application to &quot;the industry, and  to enter into a national agreement with you on the same lines.&quot; later on in the same meeting you said,  Mr. Evan Williams:-&quot;If we had any desire or intention at all either to break up,  or even to weaken the influence of
the Miners1 federation, we should not have been doing what we have done today - sitting down with you to consider this   uestion nationally and telling you what you probably dia not  expect to hear,  that, notwithstanding what we said to the Commission, we are prepared  to negotiate a national agreement with you between the Miners&apos; Pe eration and the Mining Association.On the 13th April you met again ano reaffirmed yourposition in the following words:-&quot;We have said that we are prepared  to discussand arrange with you a National Agreement.    We areprepared to do that, and to determine ,the principlesupon which the ascertainments of wages should be madein the different districts,   and  that all that isnecessary to enable  those ascertainments to be made should be determined on a national basis as betweenyou and us on lines similar  to those which have beenin operation in the past,  with the one  qualificationwhich we have put  to you and which is    I think you must agree, inevitable,  that a national minimum isno longer possible.&quot;That would probably mean &quot;a national uniform minimum is nolonger possible&quot;.    Finally on the 22nd April,   the last meetingStoppage .&apos;hat took place before the      /      you went so far as tout before the men the draft of a National Agreement and in handing this draft to Mr.Herbert Smith you said&quot;Mr.  Smith and gentlemen, as we indicated to you at our last meeting,  that we were prepared to discuss with you the terms of a national agreement,
Howe proceeded at the earliest opportunity to got into shape proposals in a definite form, insofar as its main lines are Concerned, at any rate, for  the agreement which, in our view,  should he made as between the Miners1 Federation and the Mining Association,   We had this submit ted in draft to our distriots last week, and yesterday we were in a position to send to you, in a form approved by the districts,  the proposals which v/e make in regard to it    I do not know whether the better procedure would not be to go through . tha agroetaent in detail and to diuouss i isV&apos; \clauses as we prooeed,  so  that we may have your view upon them and so that you may have our explanations insofar as they are necessary.&quot; Up to the date, therefore, when the General Strike and the National Coal Stoppage begin, it is perfectly clear, and I am sure it will not be disputed between us, that the owners1 position was that, although they disliked the idea Of a national Agreement, they were prepared to enterinto one.     It is now necessary to turn to the proceeding^ which took place after the stoppage had begun.    You had an interview with the Prime Minister and other Ministers on the 14th May at which  you pressed strongly for the introduction of an Eight Hours Bill,    You have told the Miners, when you met thora on the last occasion - and I do not oomplain about it at all     that you strongly advocated this and used every argument you commanded to impress uponthe Government the importance to the industry of ImpartingIto it  that elasticity which a lengthening of hours in certain circumstances could alone   give       and the Primo
Minister an. d his eolleagUBS were impressed with the arguments which were put forward and also as a result  of their -own env.iri eo and the advice which they received from their highly  skilled technical exports.      At this meeting on the 14th May when the Eight Hours Bill was und discussion you gave no indication to us of any change in your attitude as defined in the quotations I have read out.    On the contrary you said  &quot;As to the basis of negotiations we are quite prepared  to meet the Miners1 Federation at any  time on a perfectly  open situation&quot;.&apos; &apos; :        &apos; if; MSThat is a very  good phrase Ba perfectly open situation&apos;.It is what I have in my mind and what I am asking you to do today.    The next thing that happened was the issuetwo or three days later of the Government proposals fora settlement.    Comprised in these proposals was thesuggestion that a National Board should 1 frame a nationalAssociationWage and Hours Agreement&quot;.    To t his your / s en t in a long elaborate and argumentative written reply;but it contained no specific comment or demurrer on this point.    Then we come to the  1st May and you   defined the position, in an interview with the Minister of Labour,  in the following words&quot;I want  to make this quite clear.,    It may not be very palatable,  but I think it  only right  that I should tell you exactly how we feel in this-.matter.    The Mining Association, a such, as you know, has no powers to deal with wages  vuestions except at the direct request of I       the District Associations,  and  all that it is necessary for  the districts to do,  or even one
district to do to prevent any negotiations being carried on centrally is to say that they withdraw their authority to the Mining Association to deal with the matter for then.   We hold the same view as we have always done, that as long as there is a national body on the owners&apos; side and a national body on the menTs aide dealing with questions of wages,  so long will it be difficult to keep wage questions in the industry out of the political arena, and the greatest safeguard that could be brought about for peace in the industry and for a real settlement of the whole of these questions is to get away from national settlements altogether and leave each District to deal with the question for itself.   It may be that there is a line r?hioh may have to be taken in this matter.    I am not suggesting in any way that that is the position that we want to take up at the present moment, but rather than have any -uestion of having terms imposed up.n us from outside ....jSvidently you vere subjeoted to some argumentative pressure from the Government at that moment   -&quot;I feel perfeotly oertain that that is the line of aotion which the District Associations would take in regard to this matter.&quot; Now that I think was intended and was interpreted as a warning, perhaps even more than a warning, a veiled threat, that if the Government interfered too much with the freedom of negotiations between tho parties, the Mining Association would have to depart from their attitude towards National negotiations and insist on distriot negotiations only, but it is also a clear proof that at that date, May 21st, they were still willing to negotiate nationally and Implied an
assurance that in the absence of such interference by theGovernment suck as they depreoatthtt.t would  continue tobw their attitude.    Bow th^it was the position when the SightHours Bill was introduced and, as you know,  it was a veryserious thing for His Majesty rs Government  to introduce afacilitating the measure /lengthening the hours of labour in coalmines.    Itundoubtedly is a step whioh is greatly resented by largemasses of the industrial population, a step which was boundto be represented as part of a regular scheme and policyof lengthening hours. We arrived at the conclusionthat it was necessary &apos;and right after careful consideration,but many of us, most of u3 I think I may say were very muchinclined to insert in the Bill a series of conditions underwhich, the facility of working the extra hour could be permittedand we had a discussion with you, whioh was animated, onthat point.    You strongly argued against  the insertion ofany limiting condition and we considered the matter amongourselves and came to the conclusion that if you were willingto give us certain assurances in general terms we wouldwaive the question of inserting,  those conditions.    Then thePrime Minister made a statement, in introducing the eight hours Bill, which is reported in Hansard,  stating that therewould be offers on a district basis which would amount toall that the industry could possibly pay at   that time andwhich would be very much better offers than would be possible on the seven hours basis, &apos; ;anu so forth,  but the statement onded       with the following sentence &quot;In any oese under the proposalsalr eady made by the owners they could  not in any district fall below the 1921 minimum which the owners ^oint out, having regard to the change in the cost of living, would
now give a real wage thirty per cent, higher than at  thetime when it was agreed to,   five years ago,  and would meetthe miners&apos;  desire for a national settlement.&quot;   Now weshall not get into any dispute about personal good faith,or anything like that,-put that  entirely outside thedisoussion,-but wo did understand  that you had agreed zothose words beforehand. In any casepublished wethere oau be no question that after those word3 were/received no protest of any kind from you.    Many of your most prominentMembers were in the House when the I rime Minister usedthose words and those words    ere never the subject ofany sort of adverse comment,  from you.    The matter was dealt with entirely as a reproduction, as you might say,of a passage which had bean submitted  to you.    Howtake the whole of this chain of quotations and facts - Iam not making the slightest reproach against you - You will see,  if you put youiselves in our position,  that we,  as ministers of the Grown, were justified in our belief thatat the time we introduced the Mines Eight Hours Bill therewas no question of departing from the negotiation of aNational Agreement.    Now let me  say  this.    Vile were quitein favour  of district agreements.    We are still,  if they can be  arrived attack , and we were very glad that you were going tonegotiate in the districts, if you could arrive at agreements in that way, but we never contemplated for one momentopening the door   shutting the doerthat      / district settlements  /   meant /tfc a National settlement. We wished both doors to beopen and for  settlements to advance through whichever one could most axp edi ti oualy bo approached.
I must,  on behalf of his ha.jesty&apos;s Government, record thefact that it was our perfectly clear impression that boththrough either of them, these doors were open and that peace could be reached/     I am.quite sure of this , that if we had known that following thepassage of the light hours Bill into law a new obstacle to asettlement, a new complication, would arise through the closing of one of those doors to peace we never should have passed theBill or proceeded with it , therefore if you take up theattitude that you have now no   more power to negotiate and thatthere can he no national negotiations of any kind,  if you take up that nop possum us, attitude, while I am not for a momentmaking a charge of breach of faith I do think you will see thatis,we shall have been placed in a position whichy from our point of view at any rate, extremely unfortunate and even, as it might be thought   unfair - and that.  I know, will weigh with you perhaps more than any other argument that I am going to use.how let me just touch on a point which requires a little blunt speakingothe most important and specific of these quotations which I have read from your speeches , were before the Stoppagebegan, and of course it stands to reason that in the hope of averting a great misfortune   like that everything is offered,  even things that one does not think desirable are offered,  If they can possibly be. the means  of staving off the catastrophe But   when foreighteen weeks the country has been thrown into its present ccn-dition and when you gentlemen, as I know well, have been suffer&apos;-ing in a very formidable manner leases perhaps of  600,000 oeven  700,000 a week, in keeping the pits from falling to pieces and being flooded, when peace has not hoesecured,  I am quite prepared to say that a new situation arises.
If two States are negotiating and then they go to war, it isidle to suppose that negotiations can be taken up after a prolong-ed campaign at the point at which they left off. That is per-perfectly clear, but ,the issue to-day is :\, whether therenegotiati ons shall be national *m    or not -the issue whether t..e national negotiationdoor shall be closed or open*      &apos;    That issue, doesnot depend on your relations with the men, with those I do not wish to deal at this moment at all   I      wish to establish,by reasonable argument, that there is a relationship betweenyourselves and the Government that it ison the point of your relations with the Government,that I earnestlyask you to consider very carefully what your attitude shouldbe in regard to our formal, deliberate request thatyou should come with us and meet the men in an open, unprejudiceddiscussion.How I have to say a word about the men,     ITaturally I am not here to speak for them or to give any guarantee on their behalf.     I do not know how far they are prepared to go;    that we can only ascertain when we come to closer quarters, but His Majesty&apos;s Government required,&quot;. .  :cafter the many/ futile negotia-tions which have been attempted, some evidence which&quot;ao  satisfactory to us that the Miners Federation had made a definite change of spirit, and that they wereearnestly desirous of making a peaceful and lasting settlement. How I am not going to give a guarantee, I am in no position to do so, but honestly I believe there has been a change of heart and that there is a wish, an earnest wish, for peace, and
that there is a willingness to discuss on the merits, sc with a sincere desire to secure the greatest benefits for all con-cerned, every asp-ect of this question.     How in the letter which they have written to us there occursthis expression, &quot;a reduction in labour costs4&apos;. Thatexpression has evidently been vary carefully chosen because it is what, to use a homely term,,I might call a &quot;portmanteau&quot; expression, it covers everything, it is chosen because it covers everything.      It covers wages, it covers hours, it covers reorganised-isation, and it was chosen deliberately.That, I /think, indicates a very distinctalteration in the position that was disclosed even at your last meeting with the men, and on that it seems to me that we are bound - and I trust that you will also feel a similar obllga-tion - tocoinp to closer quarters with the matter, to hoar what is/       said under the most favourable&quot; olrcumstanoeg--^ under an impartial Chairmanship,  on both sides, and to see what practical steps can be taken to terminate this stoppage.Naturally, I have not gone 30 far in this matter with my colleagues without having considered the second steps whichat the proper time the Government will be prepared to suggest; butthis would only complicate the is siieS ^now.Y-^u should net suppose however thatwe are pushing forward in this matter without haviaig seen some
fdistance ahead along the various alternative courseswhlch may &quot;be forced upon us or which may be open to us.To sum up, I ask you to address yourselvesto the perfectly simple question,  is there to be any-national agreement at all,  or is the industry in future to be regulated purely by district agreement without any national wage negotiating body, Secondly, will you meet us with the men, being properly authorised and retaining your perfect freedom to refuse any unreasonable proposition or tobreak off the negotiations if it is found there is no change of andheart;/no desire to reach a settlement.-      will youmeet us with the men and let us see what are the practical steps, by national discussion and by district discussion - for both will unquestionably be necessary,to bring this trouble to an end;    and on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, with whonyou have been so long in close and amicable discussion and negotiation, who are after all the trustees  of the public as a whole,  on their behalf I most earnestly venture to express the hope that you will defer to our, wishes .MR. EVAN WILLIAMS:      You have a considerable advantage over me in this disecus ion this afternoon in that you knew, having prepared at j what you wore going to say, and I have to reply only after hearing what you have said.MR. CHURCHILL:     Would you like to withdraw for a few minutes?MR. EVA1T WILLIAMS:        I do not think there is any necessity. I agree with you that there is only one issue that is open for discussion between us this afternoon, and that is as to whether or not the Mining Association Is prepared to enter into negotiations with the Miners Federation to set up a national
agreement.     To put this in its true aspect it is this, as to whether the coalowners of the country are prepared to authorise the Mining Association to enter into negotiations with the miners, with the Government standing by and talcing part in the discussions, not that the question would assume any different phase at all whether the Government does or does not come in in this particular matter,     I think I must, even at the cost of repeating what has bean said many times before, say what the position of the Mining Association is in regard to questions of this kind and what its position is as between itself and the coalowners &quot;who 5 after all,  coE-pcma   it through, their District Associations in general,   The Mining Association has been in existence for a large number of years, since 1854.     It was set up to deal with questions of legislation, of questions affecting the owners of the collieries throughput the country which did not affect their relations between themselves and the men they era-ployed.     Up to 1919 there was no definite constitution that would be a constitution for the Mining Association.     In 1919 a new con-stitution was established of which I believe the Mines Department generally have knowledge, and in that agreement it is specifically laid down that the Mining Association shall not have any power or authority to .deal with ^ag-es questions affecting any district except at the direct request of that particular district.    That clearer debarred the Mining Association from dealing with &quot;tfages questions at all except by the direct request and unanimous con-sent of every District Association of the country forming it. When the war came axtod the mines were taken under control, question arose affecting all sorts of things concerning the collieries, and it was necessary, as the industry wag treated as a whole under the control of the Government, that trier- should be some body with which the Govern ent cculdbe in touch, and make such arrangements
as were called for for the regulation of the-imiltltude of matters&quot;tlx em crueisxJLonsvrtaicli required conaideration and deCis-ions , among laxxnx&apos; nof wages.     The kining Association, heing in existence for other purposes, was the only &quot;body available at the time, and withoutany questions at all in the emergency which existed the DistrictAssociations agreed at once that it should deal with any questions as between it and the Government relating to the industry;    theindustry had been treated as a whole by the Government and therewas no choice  or the coalowners except to fall in with the posit Idwhich, had been created and agree to all questions that .were put to it as affecting the Industry being put through the only body which was in existence.     It wasafter the war that the newconstitution   was arranged, but the nines   were still under con-trol,aand it was definitely the view to put an end to allnational arrangements of this hind at the earliest possible momentedand with one voice the coalowners of the country insist/upon having such a clause as I have mentioned inserted in this consti-tution.     Obviously, during the time the industry was under con-trol it could not get away from dealing with matters on a national, basis, and when we came to 1921 there were so many questions involving so much difficulty that had to be dealt with that it was obviously impracticable at that moment to resolve the problem of the coal industry into its component   parts district by dis-trict, and the coalowners agreed that forthe time being it was inevitable that they should continue to be dealfc with on a national basis, to some extent to have general principles laid down and have a National Board set up to deal with the many questions which cropped up on de-control and on the formulation of a new basis for the regulation of wages in the industry.     The basis was new to every district in the country.     As a matter of fact, I think it was necessary perhaps at that time to have ait
over-riding National Boord which was to deal with questions which arose under and out of the new method of dealing with the Indus -try.      It is no secret that at the backs  of their minds the coal-owners felt that as soon as this new method; this new scheme,  of regulating uages had been formally established there would no longer be any necessity in the industry for a national super-vision    of any kind at all, and there has been no disguise right through of their desire at the earliest possible moment to get away from national agreements and back to those district agreements which prior to the war had been the regular method of dealing with wages in the industry and which had brought about prosperity in the industry to both the owners and the men.      Itwas the miners who put an end to the 1921 agreement at a timeGovernmentwhen there was a Labour    /-      in pcY/ex1, and a crisis was broughtabout through the national determination of the whole of the wage arrangements/      &apos; in the country at the same time by the Miners Bed-eration in the early months of 1924.      At that time, the feeling in the districts against a continuance of the national agreement was exceedingly strong, arid it was only the very extremepressure which was put upon the coalowners of the countrythrough the Mining Association that led to the mineowners,  toavoid a crisis similar- to that which we hare gone through and are going through, to accept the position and make a new national aggreement with the miners and to continue for a period, which was limited to twleve months, this arrangement of dealing with questions through a National Board in so far as they concernedgeneral treatment and through the districts themselves as tothe details  of the actual arrangements to be made.      Jt was withthe greatest difficulty, as I said, that the coalowners were gotto see that at that time force of circumstances was so great,thatthe risks of the country of being held up in this way was so grea-15-
(k *sZihat a time when wes were emerging from a period of temporary and quite accidental disturbance,that, as I say, we entered into an agreement the terms of which we distinctly stated at thattime were in our opinion certain to prcrve disastrous to theindustry and which, as a matter of fact, bore out everythingand even more of those things that we prophesied for it when theagreement was made. The experienoewe had of national agree-ments up to that time, during the course of that year, producedsuch unanimity of feeling among coalowners that they must, in theinterests of peace and prosperity in the industry, revert to theirold methods of settling their affairs district by districtbetween those people who knew completely what they were dealingwith and through people who had to carry out such agreements-chatas they were dealing withy/they determined that no further national agreements would be entered into on their behalf by any body for them, and., as I have said, the view that was put to the Royal Commission on this particular point was on the lines that I have just indicated.     The Commission did not accept the view that we put forward, and I submit that it was not altogether on the merits of the question that they came to this conclusion but, being human, they could not be blind to the position that would arise with the Miners&quot; Federation if they accepted the owners&apos; view on a point to which the Miners&apos; Federation very naturally attached so very much importance.Then we come to the point at which the Government and the owners and the men had   to consider the Report of the Commission, we were faced with a position, at the end of April, when all arrangements between the Government and the industry came to an end.     There had been no national agreement in existence between the owners and the men from the dlst July 1925 up to that time, We were in the position of having no national agreement with the men, we were faced with a crisis in the industry, the Government
felt the seriousness of it quite as much as we did, and in orderto avert the disaster which has happened the Government decidedto accept a good, many things which they themselves said wereobjectionable to their principles, and the owners as well saidthat the lead the Government had fciven could not but be followedty them in the hope and the very sincere desire of trying to avertwhat has happened.      I do not think we should be,  I will not sayHaunted&quot;, because we did not do it in that form, that it should be against usheld up as an argument/at the present moment that we swallowed a good many things which were very distasteful to us in the hope that we might thereby avert this general stoppage cf work of work in this industry and also the general strike which was clearly threatened at the time we were discussion this question, and that with a feeling that we could not very well stand up before the country and say that though, a national agreement may prevent this terrible thing happening we are not going to have a national agreement which followed our predictions, we agreed to continue with the Miners Federation some form - I am&quot; wrong when 1 sayreV should continue&quot; , that we should     -establish some form of national agreement to regulate certain general questions in the industry in future.      It has got to be borne in mind that we have been pressed, not only by the Miners Federation butby the Government through the Mines Department to enter into a national agreement covering the period during which the subsidy was to be paid, but we steadfastly and absolutely refused to do anything of the kind.      In order, as I have said, to try to avert this calamity we agreed to offer a national agreement the terms of which wore simply refused hy the Miners Federation.     Under pressure from the Government we went further and said that for an eight hour day, a universal uniform eight hour day, we would, be prepared to insert in that agreement
felt the seriousness  of it quite as much as we did, and in orderto avert the disaster which has happened the Government decidedto accept a good, many things which they themselves said wereobjectionable to their principles, and the owners as well saidthat the lead the Government had liven could not but be followedly them in the hope and the very sincere desire of trying to avertwhat has happened.      I do not think we should be,  I will not say&quot;taunted&quot;, because we did not do it in that form, that it should be against usheld up as an argument/at the present moment that we swallowed agood many things which were very distasteful to us in the hopethat we might thereby avert this general stoppage of work of workin this industry and also the general strike which was clearlythreatened at the time we were discussion this question, and thatwith a feeling that we could not very well stand up before thecountry and say that though a national agreement may prevent thisterrible thing happening we are not going to have a national aggreement which followed our predictions, we agreed to continue with the Miners Federation some form - I am&quot;wrong when I sayre&quot;we should continue&quot; , that we should     -establish some form of national agreement to regulate certain general questions in the industry in future.      It has got to be borne in mind that we have been pressed, not only by the Miners Federation butby the Government throirgh the Mines Department to enter into a national agreement covering the period during which the subsidy was to be paid, but we steadfastly and absolutely refused to do anything of the kind.     In order, as I have said, to try to avert this calamity we agreed to offer a national agreement the terms of which wore simply refused by the Miners 1&apos;federation.     Under pressure from the Government we went further and said that for an eight hour day, a universal uniform eight hour day, we would be prepared to insert in that agreement
a uniform national minimum:, and I think it is only right that I should quote what the Prime Minister himself said to us at that time,  on the 30th April, when we announced our decision, which had teen brought about with very great difficulty, with very great misgivings and reluctance amongst the coalowners.      On the eve of the 1st May, the Prime Minister said in this rcora: -&quot;Pirst of all, Mr. Evan Williams, I do want to thank you for the trouble you have given to this.    I do recognise that you have made an enormous effort,  and I think that a good many members of your Association have con-, k long way,  and I do want to day that I think you have done a great deal to help things.      That, I think, is only fair to you,  and it is the truth&quot;.It is a recognition on the part of the Prime Minister at that time of the difficulties which we had had to face and of the efforts which we had made to overcome those dj   ,difficulties so that nothing we could do on our part at that time could be said to have stood in the way of averting the general strike which-followed upon the stoppage of work in the indixstry.
And right through from that, right on I think, we have met the Government fairly and reasonably in everything that has been asked of us, up to the time when the Eight Hours Bill was introduced in the House of Commons.    I do want to make this perfectly clear,  that even on the 30th&quot;&apos;  &apos; April, when a National Agreement,  or a national minimum-was offered,  it was conditional upon a uniform eight-hour day throughout the whole of the industry,MR. CHURCHILL:   You mean not that a National Agreement was conditional upon a uniform eight-hour day throughout the industry, but the 1921 minimum percentage?MR, EVAN WILLIAMS:    Specifically that, but coupled with it - you see we had   told the Prime Minister quite definitely and I may say the Prime Minister did not demur, that there was no possibility of re-establishing the industry on sound economic lines except by an eight-hour day.    I do not think there was any question at all about it.
MR.  CHURCHILL:   We cert airily thought. wo still of s o;i!e e:k baasi on of hou 1 sthink that the principle /is a necessary feature of any sett lenient which, will meet the present condition.    We have not the slight sat reason tc depart from our conviction that that is the right and proper thing to do. but we certainly assumed r -that you were&amp;going to close the door to national negotiations   - that would have made no difference.MRo EVAU WILLIAMS:    I am perfectly certain of this, that neither the Government,  nor the majority in the House of Commons who passed this, would have made it law if they were not convinced it was absolutely necessary.MR,  CHURCHILL:    Do you mean to  say that if the House of Commons had been informed that when this had been introduced the owners were going back on the whole of their position on national negotiations -MR. EVAJtf WILLIAMS:      I have not  come to that yet. There were meetings, the verbatim, notes of some of which you have quoted j which took place right up to the 14th Lay, up to the point  at which the Government made definite proposals to both, sides,  proposals which were rejected by both sides.      The Government definitely declared at that time,  on the 21st May, that it was free from all the offers which it had made and had a perfectly free hand-g&amp;nd was not committed to anything.    The Government  did make that announcement to the Miners&apos;  Federation.    We had marched step by step with the Government up to that point.    I think we had done, up t o that point,  everything that the Government Lad pressed u&amp; to do.    I do not think there can be any question about that and when the Government, whiish Lad taken a very
active part In the discussions which had taken place andin such negotiations as had taken place up to that time,declared themselves free from all their offers and no longerbound in any way by any of the proposals which had been madeby them,  they cannot  expect that the same freedom was notaccorded to the other two parties at the same time0MR. CHURCHILL.    Ho,  I make no reproach about that;it is the relationship between the Mining Association andon which I rest; His Majesty&apos;s Governments/because,   as I say,  if you were going to make so great a departure and change from the basis on which matters had been - proceeding, we ought to have been told specifically that yo\i were going to do so,  in the clearest possible way, before we met your strong wish thatyou had publicly expressed&quot;that we should pass the eight hours Bill, You should, have said clearly understandthat when you have passed that Bill, we are going to shutthe door on the idea of a Rational settlement.&quot;MR. WAN WILLIAMS:    You have rather anticipatedthe point  I want to deal with.    That is on the 21st hay,There was an interval during which nothing took place, nonegotiations between the Government  and the mining association, until we  come to some time towards the end ofJune when,  as the result of representations and arguments which we put forward,  the Government began to considerseriously the question of an eight-hour day.   We enteredthen upon a new phase and I defy anybody to say that duringthose new negotiations,   from the end of June and right onuntil July, until the Eight Hours Bill became law, there was any suggestion from the Government that this was conditional upon a  rational Agreement,  or any suggestion at  all that there
active part  in the disenssions which had taken place andin such negotiations as had taken place up to that time,declared themselves free from all their offers and no longerhound in any way &quot;by any of the proposals which had been madeby them,  they cannot expect that the same freedom was notaccorded to the other two parties at tho same timesMR.

That is on the 21st May,There was an interval during which nothing took place, nonegotiations between the Government and the mining association, until we come to some time towards the end ofJune when,  as the result of representations and arguments which we put forward, the Government began to considerseriously the question of an eight-hour day.   We enteredthen upon a new phase and I defy anybody to say that duringthose new negotiations,   from the end of June and right cnuntil July, until the Eight Hours Bill became law, there was any suggestion from the Government that this was conditional upon a national Agreement,  or any suggestion at  all that thero
should be anything.but separate district offers made by the Coalowners&apos; Associations throughout the districts, determined on an eight-hour basis.MR.  jHURJHIIL:    I cannot possibly accept that.      The assumption on which we proceeded was that district negotiations would be undertaken but that, of course,  there was no narrowing of the possibilities of peace and, if there had been,  the initiative in announcing them should have come from you, because you were changing the basis on which we were acting and therefore you should have informed us that you were changing that basis.      We assumed the basis remained the same unless we were informed of a change.MR. EVAN ...TLLIAi;&amp;:    We were starting upon an entirely new basis, a basis which gave freedom to the districts to make new offers In an entirely new condition of things.      In our reply to you on the 14th May we said that we indicated the action we were prepared to take with a view to giving effect as far as possible to the objects aimed at in the Royal Commission1s recommendations if a settlement could thereby be reached without a stoppage of work,.     (That was on the 14th May). These negotiations broke down.      Then there was a period during . which nothing took place between us until we began to talk about eight hours.      I do not know what may have been at the backs of the minds of the Government.      If they had that condition at the back of their minds they never mentioned it to us.      We had no indication of any kind at all that the introduction of an Eight Hours Bill in the House of Commons was to be conditional upon a National settlementn      They urged us very strongly and one of the meetings to which you referred at which some feeling was developed was on the very point that we had not put forward these separate district offers on the eight-hour basis by the time we were going to,&apos;
6 ^ 3bH,MR. CHURCHILL:   It was on the point of delay in putting forward the proposals.MR, EVAH yiLLIAMS:   On the point of the delay in putting forward those offers, the offers on the eight-hour hasisj and we told you quite clearly they had to he considered by each district separately.   Each district had to make up its mind what was the very best it could offer on the eight-hour basis, without any reference at all to any other district.   That was the whole basis upon which these discussions between us took place, that offers on the eight-hour basis were put forward absolutely independently by districts without any suggestion of any kind that there was an overriding or collateral Hatiohal settlement,MR * CHURCHILLi   But you see, Mr .Villiamsi where two parties are in relation, whoever makes the change in the general basis must declare it and at the moment when the Government were ta ing action, on its merits I admit, but action for which you had most strongly pressed, in passing this Bill, if at that momentyou were all the time contemplating making a change in the basisyou should immediately have said - we are going to depart from our principle and all previous declarations are null and we shall not entertain national negotiations.   You s^ou&quot;&apos;^&apos;not have let a thing like that pass silently,MR. EVM WILLIAMS:   It did not pass by any means silently.   The District Associations, each one of than, made proposals.   That was made known to the Government,
H.wo kept the Government aware of every step we took, Kts,  CHURCHILL:    Perfectly true. MR.  RVAH WILLIAMS:    And the onlytiling that was contemplated &quot;between the two sides at that time was that there should be definite offers made,  district by district,   settled by each district without reference to any national body or any other body.SIR A,  STEEL KAITLAHD:    May I interrupt for one moment,      I would like to say a word about this.   The fact that the districts were making their offers and having their negotiations,  from cur point of view mas not incompatible with the Rational Agreement.    I think there must be some mi sunder standing, but I will deal With that afterwards.MR. RVAH WILLIAMS:    There was no suggestion of any sort or kind; there was no mention of a National Agreement,MR. CHURCHILL:    It is mentioned in the very words the Prime Minister used in his speech.85    &amp;    26.m m . m.........    ......i.____-_________________ -______......
MR , .3V AH WILLIAMS: - f.t did notoccur to me when I read these words that there was any very serious collision of opinion.The only construction to be put upon the Prime Minister&apos;s words is - &quot;now you have obtained in these district offers, minima &quot;each one of which is not less than twenty per  cent.,  conditional &quot;upon its district  circumstances being adjust ed, Having &quot;obtained that twenty per cent, minimum in each of tho individual &quot;districts, your aspiration (for a national settlement is &quot;fully met without there being a national agreement.    The
&quot;substance is there without the fern:,&quot;   That is the only construction which I think we may put upon the Prime Minister !s words,    It has met the desire of the miners, for a national settlement and if the desire of the miners for a national settlement has been met  in that way3 what  further question is there of a national agreement?     There is no further question and there never was during the whole of that timdj, no suggestion from you that there should be an Sight Hours Bill conditional upon a national agreement. There was no talk of a national settlement.     The whole discussions took place upon the basis of there being separate district offers made by the District Associations on certain lines and when those were made, national agreements were not necessary.    These offers were made,  you know perfectly well, with the direct object and hope that in each district separately therewould.be a return to work I think it was perfectly clearly indicated to you asfar as the Midland counties were concerned, where there was no reduction of wages, where there was in some cases even a. higher minimum offer than the twenty per cent., that in those districts there would be,   first of all,  a return to work and the return would spread piecemeal throughout the country.    It was clearly understood between us that there was no question of a general resumption of work simultaneously,  that it would be district by district.MR.   CIIURCHILL:    That is perfectly true,  by-way of district settlementsMRLVhh WILLIAMS:    If that is so, how can you say you understood, that the question of a national settlement was still open?

...21729.and those offers wore accepted,  one by one, then a national agreement goes overboard altogethere       That was tho only interpretation that could be put upon the whole of those negotiations.SIR, CHURCHILL;   Hot at all.   There were two doors and wo wore perfectly ready to reach a settlement through the district door if there was no possibility of reaching a settlement through the national door, but no-one ever intended or contemplated that the national door would be closed and that the district door should fail to open.2-LR. ;SVA8 -TILLIaLIS:   I say quite definitely that in our opinion the national door had been closed and the only door that was open at that time was the district door and it was to open those district doors that we were urged and we agreed to make those district offers, one by one.
. 21729.and those offers were accepted,  one by one, then a national agreement goes overboard altogether *       That was tho only interpretation that could be put upon the whole of those negotiations.mr. CliUHCHILL:   Hot at all.   There were two doors and wo wore perfectly ready to reach a settlement through the district door if there was no possibility of reaching a settlement through the national door, but no-one ever intended or contemplated that the national door would be closed and that tho district door should fail to open.MR. EVAN -TILLIAiiS:    I say quite definitely that in our opinion the national door had been closed and the only door that was open at that time was the district door and it was to open those district doors that we were urged and we agreed to make those district offers, one by one.
We were urged to make these  offers as high as possible,  differ-ihg district by district, in order to get the resumption of work in detail throughout the country.     How can you reconcile that with a statement that at that time you were still expecting a national settlement?     It is contrary to the facts, I say def-initely it is contrary to the whole of the facts,however,The Important question is,/not as to whether an understanding existed or did not exist betweenthe Government and the employers. The real question is what is tho position of the Mining, Associaticn, and what are the merits of a national settlement.MR, CHURCHILL:      I submitted it to you as an argument to shew.that in the opinion of His Majesty1 s Government a national settlement wa3 not barred though district settlements were being attempted, and that was our honest impression, and you singularly failed to undeceive us at the moment v/e introduced the Eight Hours Bill, I do not put the point at more thanthat, but I take this chain of statements which you made and say it was a natural and reasonable assumption for us to make that while we knew you wore going ahead to make district settlements yet at the same time no doer to pea,ce was closed, and if we had known that the introduction of tkeEight Hours Bill would syn-chronise with a decision on your part the moment you got it to close the national door, never should we have allowed ourselvec to be placed in that position.   It was due to us that you should tell us you were going to make that change a,t that moment.
UTi. WfAxi WILLIAMS:. .     I say definitely there^was no-suggestion of a national settlement;    everything pointed to the contrary.We were urged to make offers , dis-trict by districti the only common element inthose district     offers were the Sight &quot;Hours and the 20% minimum,and they did not synchronise with the passing of the Bill,     ItI should have said there was no minimum was all preliminary to the passing of the Bill.    /      less thanSO^;   the 20/-&apos; was a minimum of the district minima.     there could not have been a national settlement in the minds of eitheryou or ourselves at a time when we were being urged if possible a minimum could to give/higher KisdbSK than 20,. in those districts which/put itforward, and in order to bring about the very thing v/hich anational settlement could not have brought about, that is to say,a break away piecemeal district bydistrict.A general resumption of work simul&amp;taneously throughout thecountry was impossible and the only way to settle thissettledstrike was to do it in detail and get it/district by district and in that way once there had been a considerable number of districts with a resumption of-work on a tolerably large scale the remainder of the district would very soon follow.        From that time forward there has been no suggestion by the Government to U3, and certainly no word fro mas to the Government, in the contrary direction.i-JEt. CHJIICWI1L:     Pardon me, we never knew you had taken this step until you met the men on the 19th August, and then you wrote a letter to the Minister of Uinoo shortly after the inter-view we had with the miners the week before last.     Immediately then we drew yvax attention to it.
MR; EVAIT WILLIAMS:      I say there was no necessity for anyintimation in   a   formal way.  The whole of the discussions - andI repeat this again - prior to the introduction of the eight hours Bill had. Been on a district basis, with which a national aggreement was  incompatible.      Then nothing more transpireduntil we got a request from the men to meet them.     I say theGovernment were aware, before that meting was held, that we were going to say definitely to the men that no national settlement nowas possible,ibs national discussions could take place, and after the meeting was held on the I9th August a whole week elapsed with no suggestion from the Government in any shape or formIt was only when I read t:    verbatim notes  of your interview with the Miners federation or. the 26th that I felt that the position which the owners had taken up,  of which the Government were fully aware and were an assenting party to, was being changed,  that I wrote the letter to Col. Bane Pox.      I say quite emphatically that so far from there being a change of front at the end of last month, the 19th August, between us and the Government or between usnand the men, everything that was said at that time was consistent with the whole of the transactions between the Government and the mine-owners right back   to i the two or three weeks preceding the passing of the Eight &quot; ours Bill,Coming now to the actual situation the position is, as has
251been distinctly stated to you, the Mining Association has no authority to enter into any negotiations with the Miners Fedora-arises out utilisation, and that position /   the constitution . of the under whichMining Association,    /    it is only by direct requests from each and every one of the districts that the Mining Association could be endowed with any power or authority to make this agreement,      I ought to say that there are districts in the country which have withdrawn from the Mining Association, and the Mining Association does not represent in any shape or form the whole nf the country at the present time, and I may say that it 1b the fact that the Mining Association entered into such a disastrous agreement with the Miners Federation in June 1924that has caused these districts to give un their membership ofSothe A;sociationf an strong is the feeling on the merits of the position in thCBe districts that I say definitely that it is not possible for those districts to so change their minds, no matter what may be the position,as to give the Assoeia.ti on powerand authority to meet the Miners Federation and discuss matters, and a maeting held between the Mining Association and the Miners Federation in those circumstances would not be honest because all they could say to them if they met them would be, &quot;We are very sorry, our position is exa,ctly the same as it was when we met you last on August 19th, and we cannot enter into any nego-tiations&quot; .      I do want to make this perfectly clear, that there is no desire on the part of the Mining Association, or on the part of the coalowners of the country, to break up the Miners Federation.       nothing is further from our thoughts.     It exist-ed before the war . The Mining Association had dealings with it   : before the war on many occasion.     In 1911 we sat for weeks con-si dering the details scml of the Mines Acts which were then brought forward . We have never refused, and we shall not refuse,to meet them upon any  general questions affecting the safety /
z&quot;health or welfare of the miners  or of those engaged in the mines,question ofWe are prepared to meet them upon any     s^isoraxxsf generalimportance of that kind, hut the question of the wages arrange-merits, the terms and conditions of employment of the workerwith his  own colliery company is a matter which cannot he dealtwith except in the districts by those who know the conditions in and ethe districts, /by thos/whvp are to carry out the arrangements when they are made.As I said, it was with the greatest reluctance that we had at any time entered upon national agreements and nationalnegotiations.      It is the experience which we in the country havehad of those agreements that has strengthened us so much in theview that we put forward, that we say quite definitely andemphatically that the Mining Association will not enter into negotiations with the Miners Federation on this point.     what has been the position?     There has never been peace in this industry since we had national agreements, since the industry hasbeen dealt With on a national basis,      Ifyou look up the Ministryof Labour figures you will find that in the 22 years prior tothe war, the only ones for which, the Ministry of Labour haveprticulars, there was an average loss of time in theeindustry through disputes,  of 5,,30 dnys per person pef annuma rrsngeinorrteIn the years during which there have been national       / there have been losses per man per annum, including this year up to the end of August,  of 23 ,,36 days per annum, and if you exclude this year, the whole of 1926, there have&apos;been losses of over 12 days per man per annum through disputes       which shows cloearly what a change there has been in the number of daysj lost in that way.     We have been faced with crisis after crisis whenever an agreement has  come to an end.     In 1924 we were faced with a crisis through:.a national settlement, and it was only averted. -\    ; r.     -:: labour by, the owners giving way to the representatives of the/Govern-
merit of that clay.      In 1925 there was another crisis a d that was only   settled      &quot;by the Government giving way to the throats of the miners .     In 1926 a similar position was brought about which was not averted because neither the Government nor the owners gave way.     As certain as there Is a national agree-ment Which brings all the districts of the country under one arrangement, so certain will there be crises of that character, and  looking not  on.ly&apos;it  the interests ofthe coalownerstheras elves butthe industry as a whole and the country as a whole -only we feel that weshould be acting m.03t detrimentally to the community as a wholeeveryif we again entered into an arrangement whio -inevitably makes/&quot; -industrial question in the mining industry a political issue.The very things that are happening this week end and to-day arein themselves proofs of the undesirable character of national agreements.      If it had not been for the question of national agreements , does anyone suppose there would have been a stoppagein Gannock Chase, Notts, Derby and Lei caster, where the men werenot asked to accept any reduction of wages at all?     The effectof a national agreement has been to bring about a stoppage even where there is no dispute as regards wages between the owners and the men.      I say it Is a political issue pure and simple,and the moment you have set up a national agreement with aNational Board you bring avery question that is relevant to thatBoard forward as a poa.itj.cal issue, with debates in the Houseof Commons, and you get the Government involved and you put theindustry as a whole on a different plane from every other in-dustry,  and such accusations as have been made that there areand that theytroubles in the coal industry/are more numerous and more bitter than in any other industry of the country are due solely and
entirely to the fa,-he that they rre dealt with on a national basis and not  on a dis cruet basis.      It gives the opportunity to direct national strikesnot against the industry or the owners, but against the whole community, and I should have thought the experience we have had since April of this year ought to be enough to convince the Government and the whole country that the sooner it gets away from these national arrangements in this or any other industry the better for thecountry.      It may be thought that by entering into discussionssomewith the Miners Federation in/way we should solve this problem. We hold the contrary vie?/ absolutely.      There are districts where the owners1  off er haiL.,.h^aa-; accepted^wi^fnoj.^ I&apos;hi^?&amp;n8&apos;e&quot;&quot; lh&quot; any way at all to national agreements.      That movement is spreading rapidly/.     Even to-day, which is a Monday and not the kind of day on wilich large resumptsion of work generally take place, there are in those three districts of Potts    and Derby, &quot;Warwick and Canhock Chase, over 2,750 Tin ore men at work than onFriday/MR. CHURCHILL:     Perfectly clearly, the discussions that we have been (having have not deterred men from returning because the largest returns have been since the peace discussion have been reopened.EYA1T WILLIAMS:     Mo.

Let me put one or two considerations to you from our point of view, and this is not going into past history, oxoept just to say that wo quite appreciate you were willing to take things in the past, just as the Government were willing to take things in the past, for the sake of preserving peace, before peaco was brokeaa, because you said you went stop by step with us in trying to accept things which you did not like in themselves in order to preserve peace and we acknowledge that at once.   jSFow the real question is to get peace again and to got peace again on a lasting basis, I am euro you will agree with that.   That is what we really want to get,     Peaco under suoh conditions that you can have a lasting peace afterwards.     That was one of the reasons why we brought in that Eight Hour Bill,    ,7e thought that on real economic grounds it was wise and right to allow the possibility of a longer working day and that, if there was not that possibility, we would not bo likely to &quot;Be able to get peace in the coal industry, a lasting peace.   That was the reason why we did it and that is the reason why we
Mifaced the difficulty which we knew was perfectly inevitable as a result.    It is a question now of whether you will go step by step and face facts in themselves in order to get peace, a lasting peace, and it was with that desire to get a peace that will endure that we took up this position.   Do just r-emember this,   that the miners have,, without question, at last made a very great advanoe.    They have made a great advance which quite definitely covers matters on which thoy were never willing to negotiate before.    They said we are not willing to negotiate upon wages and they were even more emphatic about not being willing to negotiate on hours^   It is now quite clear that they are willing to negotiate both on wages and on hours, whioh they have never been willing to do up to now.    We have every reason to believe that they are willing to enter into negotiations from which nothing shall be excluded, neither wages nor hours nor district variations.MR. EVANS WILLIAMS :      To meot the immediate necessities.SIR A.  STEEL MAITLANI).    To meet the immediate necessities.^of the industry, and that means not waiting/
258for any change until a number of -more or loss hypothetical matters have come to pass,    low that is really the state of affairs at the moment and I am sure you also are anxious,  as we all arc, that there should ho a settlement and a settlement with as little further delay and loss, both to the industry and to the people engaged in it and to the country, as is compatible with getting a lasting peace for tho industry.   How I agree with you that what one wants is a lasting peace. I sympathise at once and say so quite frankly that if we want to get a lasting peace, it will bea right and good thing if the industry is regulated by industrial considerations more than by political considerations, but we for our part do not think that tho question of a Rational Agreement in that case should stand in the way,   I was very much struck by one phrase that ].Ir.Svan Williams used.   I was struck by it because I think it covered possibilities for the future and indicated that possibly at tho present moment the phrase &apos;national agreement&apos; covered ambiguities and that it might be as well to clear those away.   Tho phrase he used was - re-establishing the previous position.   How that meant going back precisely to the same kind of agreement as there was in 1924 -ME. EVAH WILLIAMS:     Ho, simply rof erring to&apos; a national Agreement at all, without reference  -to its scope.SIR A.  STREL MAlTLAHP:   What I would ask you to do is just to get down to the actual facts and to get art the facts which lie beneath the phrase.   That is what is important in the long run.    The troubles that arose frgm the former National Agreement were in many wiiya due to uniform treatment in a national Agreement of the vihol&amp; of tiie ooimtrjr..
In this case what we consider is that a national Agreement&apos;does not exclude district negotiations,  district arrangements and if you get to that you really remove what seems to mea great deal,  if not the whole,  of the main objection which you mighty quite legitimately take,    I understand you willbe meeting a lot of representatives of districts.    I do not know if that is the case.    That is what I would ask you to do,  to  consider when, you talk it over with them whatreally is the substance underneath the question of national aggreement 0     What you want to get surely are arrangementsmade by districts which have knowledge of the circumstances,the men in which have knowledge of one. another * That is really what we want to get.,  and not to have a uniformsuit,   so to speak,   fitted to the varying figures of the varying districts by some central body.    If you can getdown then to district  arrangement^, and district discussions,fI should have imagined that in that  case you would have found probably that the word  &quot;national agreement&apos; itself took on quite a different meaning, that you would get away from the objections you attach to it&apos; and that that fact need no longer stand in the way of peace.    I do not  think it ought to interfere., the industry afterwards   being more free from what you might call political considerations than would otherwise be the case.    1 would like just to put this consideration to you.      It is not possible7 when you have had a particular system in existence for a number of years,to act or to speak as though the slate were quite clear and the previous hi story had not bee^n written.    I should have imagined that  from the point of view of poll&apos;ni r,Ci  :i r-tevf er euoo there would very
likely be more politioal interference if an attempt had been made, even a successful attempt, to try and make a number of district arrangements, simply ignoring the Central Authorities of &quot;both sides altogether,.    I would suggest that you really gat down, ae I say, to the facts underneath and then I feel I oan give you my reasons for it more in dotaii, but I do not want to take up further time at a meeting of this kind.
I feel myself quite convinced,  if I were trying toy look at it from a bUBinds-s point of view, if I were engaged in the iuhv^try, that I should be more likely to get a fair rogulationindVK-trially and l^es trouble.: aft at war. asm if I got district rhh^^r^hbsa dlsov&amp;sioraac of ar:&apos;.&apos;ange;i;?nts ,.at the came tine not sticking to past histojey as if it      had never existoA at all, and there-, fore the need for some form of national agroament could be altogether put into the waste paper basket and thrown on one side,     I could develop the reasons in detail, but I do not want to, I want to suggest to you that from the public point of view, which I know fronwhat Mr, Evan Williams sayd you have in mind yourselves, you should x v     :     get down totha auhstan&amp;s, and I-am sttve/frem that point of view,you     would find that the quest ion of a. national agreement, under the n&amp;st forms or concisions that I vary briefly outlined Is not really a matter of such substance, and that from the point of view of. the industry itself it wpu*L&amp; be wiser to agree to it t&apos;hs?.n to stand out in opposition.SIR LAMI1VG WOETHIxTGTCM SVA1TS:    &quot;  It must be recognised, Mr.. Evan Williams, that the men and their leaders set great store by a national agreement, and at one time, for the purpose of peace, j^ou vrerc willing, although., yon thought a national agrceaerit ma quit a urowoes-e arym to have a national agreement. You have told u.* that already,     la it not just as important
now to recognise the very strong&apos;^eeldn^&quot;-which^anisiat-es-themen in favour of a national agreement, and do whatever you can do, provided the national agreement does not interfere withanddistrict settlements ,/doesnot make the settlement an uneconomic sttlement?    that you are striving to do, what we are all striving to do, Is to get a settlement of this stoppage on economic terms, not on political terms.     Your objection to the national agreement is largely that you feat that will hold together the nucleus for future trouble on political lines, not on economic lines .     Is it not possible to conceive a nation-al agreement, either laying down the principles upon which district settlements shall be carried out or else bringing together the district settlements after they have been separately negotiated in the districts, bringing them together and pre-serving in a national agreement whatever common principles may emerge from these district agreements?     So long as the settlement is on economic lines, surely it does not much matter to you whether it takes the form of separate district agreements linked together so far as the principles are concerned in a national agreementj or whether it tzkes the form of a whole series of district agreements?     It is admitted, I think, on all sides that district settleiiients are going to vary the we from the other, the conditions of the industry are quite differ-ent in the varying districts, so that district negotiation is in any case necessary, but that doesnot preclude, as it seems to me, a national agreement, and I. suggest to you that so long as you keep politics out of the settlement you are not doing any harmk to the settlement and you are meeting what you know to be a very very strong feeling on the part of the men&apos;s Asso-oiation.;.di. 13RIPGSIIA1T:     I agree very much with what the
Secretary of State for War has just said.      I have not, as you f    know, been fhaxx following as  closely what has been happening day by day as many of my colleagues, but it does seem to me that we are really quarrelling over rather a small point.      There is no question, I think,  in anybody1s mind that district variations are absolutely escs: necessary, but what is the objection, if those district settlements are made and agreed to on both sides, to getting them in some form which can be ratified by those who represent the men and the owners nationally?COL. LAME POX;      You have told us you have no authority to negotiate on this basis, but you have power,   of course, to getthat authority.      Do you think it worth while?     You probably might think it worth while if you thought, or agreed in your own minds,  that the men were prepared to negotiate both on hours and wages.     We think they are?1,31. EVAH&quot; WILLIAMS:      I want to make^Lt^p*artE,;ectly clear toyou that our objection,the objection of the coalowners throughoutthe country,  is not one of form, it is  one of substance.     TheMinister of Labour has spoken of a lasting peace .    That is what we want, a lasting peace, and it is because we are convincedthat we cannot get a lasting peace that we are so determined.After all, you cannot ignore experience.    The man who will not pay attention to history in dealing with the present situation it isis not  doing himself justice, and/the experience we have had of the cramping effect of a national agreement upon district
dealing witharrangement^ , of theinevi table effect of     / the questionwhich makesas a whole   /    it becomei  a political question and not an industrial question, that causes us to feel so strongly upon this matter.     The problem is a district pfoblem, it is a very big problem in many districts, a problem that some districts wouldhave the very greatest difficulty in settling for themselves with-out any interference at all or any restrictions imposed upon them from any central authority, and to suggest that a districtproblem which varies so much from district to district can be helped in the very least by negotiations of a national character,in which/ district considerations cannot be taken into consideration in any shape or form *SIPv LAJIIHG tfORTHIHGTOM EVA j 3 :     The cardinal principle is laid down,IfR. EVAH WILLIAMS:     The principles are already embodied in all the district offers .     Can anybody suggest any   advantage to the industry or to the country from the superposition,as you put it, of a, national agreement upon a series of district agreements which have already been made.MR, 3RIDGEMAH:     What I said was &quot;ratification&quot;, MR. EVAH WILLIAMSi       How long is it going to take?t      I have not heard anybody who ha3 been able to point out a single element of national advantage,of national benefit, I mean from the point of view of the community as a whole,in having national settlements.MR. C17JRCHILL:     Surely it would be an advantage if eat by s  a national negotiations at the present tine we ended&quot;this terrible dispute and got the men back to work and the industries of the country going *&quot;Surely that is our object?
What we are here for is to find a way of ending the dispute.MR. EVAM WILLIAMS :      It is because we feel so confident tha^ anything in the nature of national negotiations,  quite apart from merits or demerits,  is going to prolong the strike that we are reinforced in our opinion that it would be a national disaster0      It is in the interests of the country as a whole that we feel 30 strongly in this matter.ill.  BRIDGEMA1T:      Supposing you got district settlements made which were perfectly satisfactory to all of you, to you and to the men,  discussed in the districts, they must contain some elements that are common all round0     What would you or they lose,  or what would anybody lose, by collecting those districts: arrangements together and saying, 7&apos;These are made according to what each district can do, and we as a whole ratify them with all their variations&quot;.MR. EVAIT WILLIAMS:     What does anybody gain?MR. BRILGEMAH:      Peace, probably.MR. EVAIT WILLIAMS:      Mo,      You will have had peace with the district agreements.    What are you going to gain? MR. LRIDGEMAL:      You ratify peace.MR.  CHURCHILL:      You may    not succeed in making districtagreements apart from a national understanding.      In June you were confident that distinct agreements would TSebmade on an eight hour basis, but nothing has  occurred, and as long as theaea national agreement is this kskzeissdt veto on iixsfckixi the struggle  may go on fst weeks.MR.  EVAIT WILLIAMS:      I  do not want to make any further Bishops.      the reference to the/jocular remark which 1 made the other day has47
^ iS? **&quot;been mis interpreted, though it -was received with laughter at the time, hut I say quite definitely we carinot lay the hlaxae for any of the delay that has taken placeon the coalonwners;   a great deal of blame can he laid on people outside, and I feel quite sure the industry - and other industries who support us to thethehilt on this point/, Dig industries of the country - are perfectlyconfident that the only lasting solution of this difficulty,and the quickest solution after all, is by dealing&apos;with thematter in the districts where the problems are known and wheremight be donethey have to be faced;whatever       / in the way of a nationalpreliminary or subsequent national agreement these problems have got to be faced, and the districts feel that they are not going to be hampered by national agreements which may have been entered into before they msqccfc make these agreements, and they are not going to subject agreements which they may have made locally, and which are satisfactory to both sides, to the veto or even to the registration of any other body.  .111. C:-7!7:;CHILL:     Mr. Williams, I must most earnestly beg you not at this meeting to use language which will preclude you from seeking from your constituent bodies the necessary authority to enable you to meet with us and the Miners 1&apos;federation.If you were to take that step you would be taking an immense responsibility upon yourselves.     I think that the impression undoubtedly will be that,fool yourselves .   ,you    /   in a position to close a door Whxcn, m the opinionof His Majesty&apos;s Government, may be found - may, I only say &quot;may&quot;may be found to give the means of reaching a peace - that, tomy mind, would be a grave position, and I implore you notto take that step.     I have gone back upon the past, not at all for the purpose of recrimination:    but I have
discussed the attitude which your Association- have had towards a national agreement from the &quot;beginningbecause I wanted to convey to you the impression which that series of events has produced upon His Majesty&apos;s Government,If you will study what I have ventured to say when it appears in the transcript,    you will see that it casts a very significant light upon the position of His Majesty^ Government. We were, not aware that doors would be closed and would remain closed even if the other 3ide showed a disposition to knock at them or to enter in them.  We were not aware that at this stage, after the country has suffered for so many weeks, the dispute would be prolonged,  in the opinion of a great many people, through the closing of these doors,or any door national or district, After all, if it io your view that districtsettlements are much better than national settlements and that district settlements would remove the necessity for national settlements, surely it is at least your duty to appear in the presence of the other party and to argue your case,But to take the course of saying, &quot;We are out of action altogether for the purposes  of national negotiations as an Association-, and the matter no longer rests with us in any way&quot;, is to take a most serious.attitude.     After all, the question of a national agreementisdispure as mucb as an Industrial issue in the / wages and hours, and if the Government thought fit to set up an Indus -trial Sourt you would have to attend as a national bodybefore that Court or else sec your case go by default.     Theniatter is really not one when a body, which for a whole year has been before the public as the united spokesmanof one side in the industry, should suddenly say&quot;We have dissolved ourselves,  our powers have gone, there is
nothing but the voiid- to talk to now, &quot;A .1 attitude of that kind is bound to arra jagainst you a    mass of public opinion ia the country,So far as the Government is concerned, after what has passed and what has been said, and after the long recital of ourhonest understanding of the general position, it is quite clearthat if we receive, as I earnestly hope we shall not receive -but after you have consulted your constituents, certainly not to-day - axxi^tiiT^tinio;^if we receive in the course of the next day or two - I agree with you that matters must be pressed forward - a definite refusal to do business on a ny terms, or even to discuss whether business should be done,-if we did receive that it is perfectly clear that we could not leave matters where they are.     We have come into the open definitely in the last few days and have accepted a new situation and the force andare vpower of His Majesty&apos;s Government   /   engaged behind that position,and it is essential that that should be realised because we have great responsibility in this matter, we have legislated inthismatter, and legislated, as you have pointed out,  in accordancewith your advice and wishes . and therefore our -res pens responsibility isa very grave one.If a final decision on your part never to negotiateagain with anybody on a national basis, never even to enter intoa discussion with anyone on a national basis, was going to be the last word in the matter, If that should unhappily be your posltion-and I most devoutly and earnestly hope it will not be your decision - if it 3hou&apos;ld be then it seems&apos;to me quite clear that we shall ha.ve to move forward upon our own course of action in your absence.
But I would saraes-tlyHrope^^your constituents authority to enter into discussion in order  that the position may be explored.    It is not being explored in the districts today,    BIghtly or wrongly, however it may he, the Miners Federation havo bean able to impose a veto except in the Midland area upon any effectual resumption and upon the making of district agreements,    l?or you to take up at this time an unalterable attitude woitld be a very serious disaster.    So may I take it in conclusion that while you adhere very strongly to the views which you have expressed, nevertheless you will seek from your constituents their opinion.    You say the stoppage has- :   - 1 -       &apos;    - - - :-:h:      &apos; :    .    .   . 1   v. ;   :     -      -     &apos;    . - &quot;    -   .   - . . .&apos;      &apos;        &apos; -       \        :       . 1 : ,  :       .   &apos; . .      1    - - &apos;   &apos; -   :^ jcontinued baoause of the various peace movements,    otherwise the men would have come in,    I do not believe that for a mount, but whether that be true or false, in this countryunquestionably a prolonged dispute of this kind, causingall the suffering and the distress whioh it does, will be attended by repeated efforts for peace and that Is a faotyou must take Into consideration.    Now I do ask you to convene your constituents and to recover the power whiohyou had.    Use it as you think fit and only if you see thereis an improved situation,,    If there is not an improvedsituation we shall not be in any attitude of antagonism toyou,    It is because we believe that there is a ohange andbeoause we hope that it may he developed into the means of peace and into removing the deadlock and Into releasing the possibility of district settlements from the effective vets under which they now lie that we have taken this step.MR,  EVAN WILLIAMS:    I am sorry that in your concluding remarks you rafarred to the point which we discussed at such great length to begin with and that you again suggested we are seeking to take advantage, after it tookplace,  of the faot that the Eight Hours Act is now on the Statute Book.    I do most emphatically deny that that is the position/
9   ain any shape or form.       Our position has ho en perfectly clear and I maintain there was a complete understanding between.us and . the Go vamioeuf- s.nd that the passing of the Sight Hoars Act did not oaastituto a bargain of any sort between us and the Gw/onniicut. Unless the House of &apos;Commons thought it waa a right thing to release the industry from the Seven Hours Act, it would not have done so.     It was because it was the right thing to do.     It was not contingent upon anything the owners did or were prepared to do.While the whole of the question in the districts Is an industrial one,  the moment it is mace national then it becomes political.     We are firmly convinced that to start national negotiations, which we know cannot possibly come to any conclusion, would ielay for an appreciable period sstt !:*ng down in the districts to considering their own problems and solving them.     We are convinced that that wo all be the worst step we could&apos;possibly take at the present time.      That is one. of our reasons. The other main reason is that on its merits,  in the interests of the country as a whole, you should put an end to the means of bringing about these
national crisos.   Thr-ough. tills quo-stion of a National Agreement, districts in &quot;which the owners have never given notice to the men were called out by the Miners Federation, a thing which could never happen except   oiler -a national basis.MR. BE 11X525:1 AN;    Nobody has suggested that you should begin with a National Agreement before you have thedistrict settlements.MR. SVAN WILLIAMS.     You have asked us to seek powers from our constituents, if I may so use the word.     We cannotseek powers to do what we feel is wrong.   We have a meeting in tho ordinary way tomorrow of our Central Committee.   we will certainly put the whole of the facts before them andwe shall take their opinion,MR, CHUMCHILL :   I hopo you will put before them the earnest consi dersd request of tho Government that theyshould, empower you to coxae and meet the Miners Federationwith a view to discussing what are the mostexpeditious means of ending the present deadlock.   That is all I am asking at the moment.    The Miners will say - makea National Agreement,    It will be open to you to say - no,we think district agreements will be better, but at any rate:como to the point where that issue can be raised,to discussSIR L. WORTHING!ON ilTVANS:   And/what &quot;they    mean by National iigreement     Let us see what the realx difference is,MR, SVAN v7ILLlA...S :   You know perfectly well the stand the Miners Federation has taken, there must be thenational settlement and simultaneous resumption of work.That is tho position they take up.-54-
212If,  as is practically certainwhichwhen we discuss this matter tomorrow,- our  Central Committee/ consists of members of every district,  and will have before them the whole of this discussion which is going to be made public, are still of thesame view,  it will be dishonest on our part to enter into a semblance of discussion with the Miners Federation; we should, have to tell them definitely that it is the view of our District Associations that they will not permit the Mining Association to enter into national discussion,  or national negotiations at allt   You realise what the position is?     A national settlement is impossible unlessevery district in the country comes into it *      National negotiations by the Mining Association are impossible except with the consent of every district in the Assoelation.    If one large district,  for instance Yorkshire, were to say - no. 7 we are unalterably opposed to it, we will not authorise you to deal with this question nationally on. our behalfr then the Mining Association could not deal with it.
273MR. CHURGaHL:    It is no use -carrying the matter any further at the-moment.    The only thing to do is to  &apos;ait until tomosrow^vrtien you will let us know what your final position is^, I cannot add anything to what I have said.(The proceedings then terminated)10 Downing Street, 3.W.1, 6th September, 1926*-56-
