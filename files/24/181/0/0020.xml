MR. CHUHCHILL: Gentlemen,  following upa letter which wo sont you ten days ago you have asked for a meeting with Ministers and we therefore thought itour duty to arrange immediately to meet your wish, and/we are here to listen to any statement  or suggestions which you may make.MR. COOK:    I take it you have a copy  of the proceedings with the owners?MR, CHURCHILL:    Yes. Our view is that a copy should he available for both sides of everything  that has passed and both sidos will be free to make any statement they think fit to make aboxit it  and to make a report.MR.HiiiRBMRI SMITH;    I think from past experience we must make our own report to the press.    We wrote to you as soon after the meeting with the owners as possible saying that if you thought any useful purpose would be served by a meeting we should be at your service at any time,, You wrote back changing the position saying if wean ted to meet you you would be willing to meet us. As soon as anything was fixed up it was in the press. If anything o f that sort is going  to be done we will make our own report. I thought business between&apos; the Government and anybody else was private until made public by both sides, but this came from your department that we had asked for a mc ting and had climbed down over this and climbed down over the other,.  You know us better than that.HIR A. 3 TEEL-M AIT LA WD:    It did not come from me.
G,MR0HERBERT SMITH;    It was confirmed on the telephone that It came-from one of yoar department s.We were very anxious after our meeting with theowners, Mr. Churchill and gentlemen,,  to soe what position theGovernment was in and what good offices it could render inregard    to seeing If a solution to this question could he gotoSome of you   people have been making speeches and I expectyou have seen that we have also been making speeches.    Ithink we all realise that the mining problem, cannot be merelybetween   the   two contending parties,   the owners and  theworlaner,c It has its effect on the country in various ways. Itwill be seen when we met the owners we simply put before theowners the question of trying to open up negotiations and seeingwhat could be done by way of a settlements    Biey did not hesitate to tell us their minds were already made up.    Theyused their influence with the Government and   the House ofCommons to get the Eight Hours Bill on the Statute Book and extent.they were going to utilise it to the -fullest possible / In addition to  that, they were going to have district agreements. If we would have lower wages we could start at  once9 Those were the terms they offered and they said on the first two there is no   negotiation at allo    I have seen it was said during the  discussion in the House that this Bill was optional; it was not compulsory. but you know,  gentlemen, as soon as any nan signs at the colliery to go  to work he has to sign a contract of service, He must be clown in the pit at a certain time and he must come up at a certain time. When once you    sign this contract  of service it becomes not  optional but compulsory  that he must stay down that length  of time. We have not yet after all these 118 days d. ecideu that we are going to agree to an eight
lion?; s day. However long it nay take to reach a settlement we wish for a settlement  on fair terms. We say  there is p lenty of room for discussion in the way I introduced it to The owners to discuss the question of method of ascertaining where there is any possibility of avoiding a reduction in wages and we told the owners when we had dealt with them as far as we possibly could we would go ana see you gentlemen to see how far you were prepared to help us.    2n reply to that they took up the position that they were against all Government help;  they didnBt believe in it. They did not i.hesitate to tell us that they were even against asking you people to meet us and see whether any good services could be rendered fey you In getting us and the owners together with yourselves and seeing what could be done in that direction. That is what we had in view when-we said we wanted to sea if any good services could be rendered by you.   We are asking if there is any good service you can render to bring about negotiations to see if a settlement can be arrived at and as to what amount  of help can be given by the Government not only in negotiations but financially for a period.MR. CHURCHILL: . 1 think I bad better at thevery  outset clear out  of the field any proposition which we should hot be in any circumstances likely to entertain because the question of giving any financial help to the industry has long passed out  of the sphere of practical politics.    We gave twenty  three millions   when I last  saw Mr. Cook. I told him that, we gave 23 millions to secure nine months in which to  try and come to some sort of settlement of this position.        It was a very  questionable thing for the Government to do to use the taxpayers1 money in that way and we had the greatest difficulty in justifying it. That
was th-v end, absolutely  the end. There was of course the three millions which I reserved in the budget of this year because if we could h,rve avoided this struggle it might have been thrown in to make a taper to ease matters off or assist in the removal of miners from pits that might be closed. There was the three millions but as there has been all this long stoppage and such tremendous expenses thrown upon us that was entirely withdrawn, but we have said that what is left out of that after the various expenses we are now being put to have been defrayed ..    will be available for aiding the movement of miners from any pits which may be closed, , and we have actually  earmarked  250,000 for the development of scientific research,  the attempt to    developliquid fuel from coal and other projects with which you are very well acquainted. But of course we have bought agood deal of foreign coal and if the stoppage comes to an end, whenever it does come to an end, we are bound to be left with a certain amount  of this o n our hands . and as coal will    certainly fall in price we shallhave a loss on that,- Qjhed?efore I cannot say it will   be three millions. It may be half but what-ever is left will be available to carry  out the recommendations of the -&quot;Royal Commission that the Government should assist the removal of miners from pits no longer in working order, no longer able  to pay the rate of wages that is decidec upon, and that is  the end..Nothing in the nature of a subsidy  however small,bow ever temporary and nothing in the nature of a loan by the Government, which is after all exactly the same as   a subsidy ,would. be possible to us now. . It is notour money : we are answerable   to the taxpayers of the
country as a whole, and there are 750,000 men out  of work who would, now he working apart from miners hut for this prolonged stoppage.    There is an immense amount of suffering throughout the country in many districts particularly in the working class districts In the big basic industries The revenue is affected,   everything is affected. We made an effort last year to avoid  thessevils, but now these evils have happened. We could not possibly consider anything in the nature&apos; of financial help.Lhh GCOh:    May I ask, if one may venture,  do you not agree that an honourably negotiated settlement  is far better than a termination of a struggle by victory or defeat on either side?   One may go away knowing if it could be avoided it would certainly save a lot,   the cost would be  certainly more than three millions,  but the cost must be colossal every  day now.  It has to be made good somehow or other, but  there is a stage- instead of getting right up against our disagreement.- is there not a stage of agreement. For instance,   the Government recognised that an agreement, a national agreement for instance - the Prime Minister himself agreed in the early stages, and I think Oolonel Lane-Fox and the Minister of labour are agreed that  that was essential or beneficial to the industry in the light oi the interpretation of the report,  and that the question of hours, so  far as the report was concerned, it is true,us one that should be mutually decided between the employers and employees in the industry before any changes would be legislated upon or legal enactments taken. Hov   there is an old  saying you- cannot drive the mill with the water that has passed, whatever it may be, Is there no hope that now even at this stage the Government  could  get the two sides
together so that we could negotiate a national agreement and see first whether there are not some points of agreement rather than getting right up against  our dis-Hgreements.    Your  strong argument is last j oar you bargained for peace and you did not  get peace.    Peace is essential of course, in any form of society,whateyer our theoretical beliefs may be, war Is destructive and peace is constructive. &apos;That is a generality we agree on,    Surely if some measureof finality  coult   be secured for the peaceful decelopment  ox the industry and all this chaos could be hammered  out by some machinery,, Neither tho Government, nor the country3 nor the owners themselves would benefit by a settlement for sis months or twelve months and then at -the end of that time another conflict,.    We ought to learn something.MR. CHURCHIIl;    I think we would all agree with you in thinking  that it would be very much better for you to terminate this matter if possible, if you find you can terminate it by a general act of your own volition than that it should simply  go forward indefinitely until finally  thef orce of circumstances and events yrevail ana there is nosort of agreement to which   you are parties, but what I want to ask you,. if youiswill    allow me to do so/how will your position in thematter be benefited  supposing we go  on for another sirweeks or two months, V/e have learned a good  deal since thisstoppagebegan. If you had asked me when the eoa1     / beganwhat I thought tho loss to the country v. oulc   be aft er the twelfth week I should have given you figures ten times as high as those I now know  to be the case. as a matter of fact the country has shown a most extraordinary power ofin whichcarrying  on except in the great basic trades     /      so many
of your own people and your own friends and people whoengaged.have suffered a great deal to help you,are /       Generally speaking the country as a whole, the exports for July,  for instance, were better than a year ago making allowance fox- the fact  that no    coal was exported and making allowance for prices-.    Unemployment is better - of course the harvest-has something to do with    that - but the Minister of Labour has reported a d im.ir.ru ti on - between six and seven hundred thousand men were/employed during the general strike -but since-tho general strike,  we   arc 50,COO better than we were then. People        are buying coalo We are net called upon to buy coal i o any extent now. It Is ooming in freely, nearly one million tons a week. It could  easily be increased, n5 doubt, if the cold weather came. On the other hand, there is a certain output here and outcrop workings are being used, and there is no doubt whatever that we are in a position where we have no difficulty in   carrying on   the life of the country, a large proportion    of the trade of the country and all    the vital services.    As to its prosperity, I agree there is suffering every day$ but as far as carrying on the thing for another six: weeks or two months is concerned there is not the slightest compulsion or pressure on    the Government such as we should have imagined would have been op era ting on us when we looked at it sixteen weeks ago.    That Is a very  remarkable new fac^, a very extraordinary fact and what I want you to consider Is this -how will you be better, supposing we come and meet again when the frine Minister is back how willit he better for your people than it is today and for your organisation?   As far as we are concerned you may be sure we shall give no   money * On that we are absolutely
clear, but you noe-   not think we wish to humiliate youor the miners o As a &amp;0v orrauent we have no such  idea or feeling in cur mind at all, nothing of the sort.    There Is nothingwe should rejoice in more than that you should make a goodworking arrangement in the industry. tWe should rejoine Whether there should bein that,/nati onal or district sottl extent s       is not for usto   decide-. - I cannot see why  the twocannot be reconciled^ but that is for yoTio All I would Bayis that we do not see how you benefit your position by afurther postp onement of the settlement^MR,RICHARDS:    I regret very much that speech sayingwhich I interpret as /        to us this, you cannot hurt us, carry on* &quot;That is the sum and substance of that speech,, How I wanted you to regard us in the capacity today, as we expected to find youjdesirous of trying to find a way  out of this great difficulty,MR0CHURCHILL;&apos;  Y/e are. . SIS AsSTMEL HAITIANS:    I   Ishink everyone is anxious to find a way out of the difficultya 8t is only  that the subsidy is left out  of the  question,,MR0RICHARDS:    If I may put that claim forward, we are much in the same position, the four of us, as you are, only in so far as we represent  only the miners of the country and that we have been their supporters in their resistance to the unfair terms that have been attempted to be enforceu upon them, but even after throe months  of that resistance with our strong support we felt a few weeks ago that something ought to be done and took the reponsibili ty of attempting it and I think if we had had what we really did expect,   chesrpport of  the Government at that time, we should have carrieu it through and we should have settled
-f i&quot;1 &amp;* Ml 3and been in work now.    Bather than that the Prime Ministerji;:hhv:h h;&apos;:&apos;&apos;r&apos;:&apos;: J      &apos; :: -     &apos;       h&apos;i        - --undertook, b ef or e even the terras were brought to him, to writea letter, to send a communication to say much what you &quot;\have been saying today, that the Government were notprepared to render any assistance to bring-this to an end.Well it may not be as disastrous to the country as we thinkit is, but I think you ought to appreciate that thiswill go on for some time unless there is some effort on thepart of the Government and, ourselves to bring it t o an end,and despite what you say about  the cost I venture to say this  that another two months&apos;  extension of this struggle-will    jcost the country much more than the money necessary tosettle it tomorrow, much more.-    I was a bit astonished at jjyour interpretation of the loan as I understood it. Itmust not be taken that we brought that as one of thesolutions, but I do not  think it was open to the int erp re tat i on (:you are putting upon it, as it was put to me,   that the loan        jifstands in the same category as a subsidy.&apos;        : &apos; &apos;   :j!&apos; j-;-.&apos;---;--;!       &apos; ; &apos; -;     .-   1 : -      jjMR. CHURCHILL:   A Government loan?   A private loan &quot;a *     wIkMR.fJICHAHDS;    As far as I know it has hever been- , %mentioned to us the/idea of a Government loan. What wasImentioned to us was the Government guarantee for a loan. MR. CHURCHILL:    That is the  same thing. MReRICHARDS :    Oh no.1I1R. CHURCHILL:    It is the  same thing. i.iR.RICHARL3:    It is lent to    the industry and  the industry will, repay it. The Government   will always getsufficient control to see that the repayments   are made. I 4Ido not think that stands       in q;ilte . the same category as a        .&apos;ji Isubsidye    Surely it is worth some effort and some I1 Isfinancial responsibility seeing that there is every pro )abili ty &apos; Jf
despite all the  defections   hat are made s o much of Inthe press, it must be known to you that after pressure from our  officials, pressure from Mr. Cook who has beena 3regarded,  and rightly  so, / the leader of this fight, the menturned down these proposals, but I believe they turned them down because of  the disappointing attitude of the PrimebecauseMinister in regard to them, and/another feature in them,  that unfortunately  they were not terms of settlements, The men were not askeu to accept   them as terms of settlement so they . have not been discussed in that way. They were not  terms of settlement, only suggestions and those who were opposed to any settlement at all and were opposed even at  the end will be able to make use of  those;  they say those are only suggested terras not terms we can settle upon and what they mean is they are open to negotiation and whittling dovm0 That is how we got  the comparatively small majority against what are known as the -Bishops8 terms. Those terms indicated financial assistance  stanc ecMB. CHURCHILL:   Mr. Richards, I must not mislead you thatinto supposing/because we say we can give no financialassistance ,our good offices are not available. They wouldbe available freely to  enable the country yourselves,ourselves, and all of us to get out  of this very lamentablestate of affairs.  But it is no use good  offices being available unless you know; what they are to work upon,  andI am bound to say when I heard you were coning to seeus  today  I hoped you would put be-fore us certain quite new and definite suggestions which we oould consider and if we thought there was any real practicable chance of a solutionasb eing reached by them then/we have said  over and  over again, the Prime Minister and  everybody,  our good offices would be
availabl e in whatever way  they would be most useful. Therefore if I tua.ro down anything in the nature of a subsidy it does not at all moan that we would not use our good offices provided that there was some ahance of their coming to some useful   result o That is where it Is really up to    you,  if I may say  so at this moment.    Have you   anything in your minds that alters the present situation, anything that can be put forward? If so6  do so now, * But let me saythat it has been agreed that what has been said shall be recorded fie can   agree among ourselvesthat if there is any special thing you wish to say you wish to be excluded from the report,  it can be excluded. We would trust you in the matter, but I think it better that the whole transcript should be made0 We feel it is up to you to tell us what is in your- minds and what is the practical contribution you make to stop the present deadlock. Our contribution us been mades 23 millions.MR.RICHARDS:   We say you threw the 23 millions away0 That is cur interpretation of that. If closely examined it can be pretty  strongly verified,. It did not help the industry one bitaMR.GHUROHIIil:    It gave nine months.M.R.,RICHAEDS:    line months1 work of course,MR.CHURCHILL:    It gave nine months in which to think things over.MR. RICHARDS:    There was no   attempt by the other side to think things over. They simply got the money as oneof them admitted at the enquiry. Sir Arthur Markham, the gentleman who recently died, was asked by Mr0Smith, in your group of collieries you never sent in any returns previous-ly for the regulation of wages,, and he said no, we did not. We did not believe in thema    But you sent  thsam in after the subsidy,. He said  ^h yes, that was simply getting something for nought *0 That was the answer given at the Commission by a man who was making money.
COLONEL LAiDS POX:     But your people took advantage of the nine months1 subsidy as well.MR. HMRBSRT SMITH:    In what way do you mean?MR. RICHARDS:   We were called upon for reductions $n wages and we had not room to give them.   We have not room now really although we may he beaten and be compelled to give them, but any fair-minded man who examined them would say there is no room for reductions and that this country cannot prosper when you have a body, of nearly one million men sent back to work for the wages that are being offered in some of the pits.MR. HERBERT SMITH:&apos;   After your statement I do not think we need detain you longa    You seem to me to be of the same mind as xhe employers,      I am not here to make a petitione    If that is what you think I am here for you are mistaken,    I am here to get an honourable settlement. I have never yet burked the position,      I made a statement when we first met that I am prepared to take that bock and examine it page by page and accept its findings, but 1I was not prepared to come into a conference and agree to a reduction in wages before that enquiry took place.    You people have shammed, to accept this commission s Report. First when you write to me on the 35th April and say the owners are prepared to come to a settlement on that Report with a reduction or- thirty-three and a third and an hour&apos; s extension.    That is not in the Report,    That is the first thing you do.    If what you say represents the views of your colleagues I do not think we need go any father into the question.   We can carry this fight on a bit further yet.   We have got to do it if you force us to do it,
We have been trying to avoid it.    We have been doing all we possibly could to avoid any pit flooding, but after, that speech . &apos; we have tofight on; v/e are forced to fight on; you force us to do it, because we are not prepared to extend the hours 0    That ie the first thing we want to be absolutely clear about, we are not prepared to extenfi our hours and if you went down some of our deep pits instead of thinking about an extension you would be reducing^ the hours.    Then you talk about district agreement Sj, Mr.Churchill says it does not matter whether they are district or national, but it makes all the difference in the world to us.MR c CKUR CHILI,:    I did not  say it did not matter. I said it was not for us to decidecMR. HERBERT SMITH:    I will take your own words t-&apos;lt was not for us to decide &quot;-but it is for us to thinkabout o      If you are here today expecting that we have come to say - well,  here we are, take us and settle it as you like and we will accept it, you are thoroughly mistaken0We are here to try and get an honourable agreement s  for ite^chto be thoroughly enquired into, to see what/collieryis being paid; many a time have we asked for returns butnever have we been able to get them.    I say that thegeneral public got the twenty-three millions- Railwayfreights went down from 100/$ above pre-war to 60% above pre-war-war,.    The next thing was we exported less coal endgot  a considerably lower price for it *    How, gentlemenj youare misunderstanding us today entirely.     We are here to talk and we want to talk; we want to talk heart to heartand to try and got a settlement, but we are not here -I want to emphasise this - we are not here to say to you
we are &quot;beaten,,  settle it as you likes.MR, CHURCHILL:     It is for you to make some statement,,   Having come here you should make some statement. We all want to see it settled in an honourable way0MR. HERBERT SMITH:    There is no need to press it after your statement when you say - this is it -and - that is it,MR,  COOK:     We feel that your reply was ratherbrutal to us.SIR A,  STEEL   MA1TLAMD:   Might  I just say this..&apos; . We are just as anxiousboth for peace and for an honourable settlement as anyone,Ve always have been.    The Prime Minister has been fromthe &quot;beginning   we all have beenj    I do not want to go overold ooints of difference but when Mr f,Smith says we ^hammedI must replyin the acceptance of the Report^/we did nothing of the kind.We were perfectly ready to accept it.   We said we were andwe were prepared to  carry it out and when it  came to thooffer of the twenty per cent s - I only just  say this inso thatpassing so that there shall be no mistake about it and/it &apos; bemay/upon the record - &apos; it was because you asked for a uniformnational minimum -to apply to all districts thatthose particular terras were put before you then? &quot;But yousee our trouble has been really this&apos;, that we have neveryou have askedobtained any advance from you.    Here this afternoon/in the first place for Government assistance^financial assistance.      As we sand   we were willing togive it in the first place, but once the &quot;break had actually taken place then Government assistance is quite out  of the
question,    As regards the other points, Mr. Sm.it h, you say you v/anfc an honourable settlement.    An honourable settlement can only look to the conditions of the industry. You have really not moved from refusing to consider any extension of the seven-hours day.    You have just said so now.MR/ COOK:   We have.SIR A, ST e.c.    KAITLAMD:    You have again said you were willing to go through the Report,.. &apos;      and stand by the Report when you had gone through it *    You said that at the Memorial Hall long before the Strike begano Mil, HERBERT SMITH:    And say it now. SIR A. STEEL   ItAITLAHD:    How the Report a aid quite directly.,   as everyone knows,  that there must be some immediate adjustment of wages in order to meet the k situations    That again you quite definitely refuse and when it  comes to the form of the settlement it means that whether there is a national agreement or not there must be     district ar^gp^onte^ least thQ Report argued thatthere should be,, as regards wages e    So far as we can see you have not moved one inch from the position you took un,The RoportMRc RICHARDS:    j    only      .    &quot;&apos;-o makes certain suggest i ons ,SIR A.  STEEL.   MAITLAHD:    You can argue that ,    At any rate,   as far as we can see you have not moved one inch forward to meet the situation right from the beginning, Fow we are,  as I say,  quite truly    as anxious for peace for the sake of the country as anybody can be and nobody wants more than we do an honourable agreement, but there must be
an advance from you and some quite definite proposals so that we can put them &quot;before the owners as leading to the chance both of an honourable settlement and of peace. You cannot stay exactly where you were at the beginning, making demands of t hc.it kind, and yet say now that if there is not an&apos; honourable settlement and not peaoe it rests with anyone else but yourselves.MR, HERBERT SMITH:    probably we have moved the position but how had we better phrase it?    When you say there has teen no move at all^  I  say there has, but may I say I have objected to the way the medicine has been meted out every time*    That Report puts in one section what should be done,  first royalties,  secondly amalgamation, thirdly research - I may be wrong,, but at&quot; any rate the sixth thing is wages and every time you have put .(6) in the place of (l) .    I have distinctly told you today and I told you at the first meeting - what I did say has been misquoted many times by my friend,  Colonel Lane Pox, but that is nothing new  -   we have alwaysobjected to your reading Ho,6 as Ho. 1.   We say - do these things as provided in (l) ,   (2),   (3),   (4)  and (5)  and we will accept the results in Roc6 when they have &quot;been ascertained. I do not say we will give it. I say put th reforms/   into existence.    The Bill you put before parliament is not worth that as far as amalgamation is  concerned.    I say now what we have said all the time - if the pits cannot pay a respectable wage tfo enable    Or man to work respectably and allow him to live respectably then they had better be closed and the sooner the better.    I do not believe in preaching
!ca-cannyc When a man goes to a pit he is expected to do his work and produce as much as it is possible to produce^ hut when he has worked I want to see he has the money and that I am going to do as long as I possibly can. You people say take (6) flrst8 let us discuss (6) first and then all the other things will follow,. Now I obj e ct -SIR A. STEEL   11AITLAND.    You will remember we said to you in the original negotiations - will you agree to any reduction provided we go speedily forward with reorganisation and you said,  quite definitely, no in answer to me.   The Report is quite clear and quite specific,  if you look at page 335. halfway down3 on the righthand side you will see that quite clearly, quite specifically the Report says you have got to meet the present situation,   No-one likes it.   We do not like it any more than you do 0    It say3 quite clearly you have to meet the present situationc   We were prepared to go on as quickly as possible,, but you said noc MR. RICHARDS:   Why didn&apos;t the Government keep up the neutral attitude that you are now assuming and which you did assume for some time?       Why did they accept what the owners said and why did they take the field against us and pass that light Hour Act?SIR A. steel    MAITLA1TD;    I say quite definitely the Government never abandoned the neu&amp;r&amp;i attitude and never tried to take the field against you.;R. RICHARDS:    They brought in that Eight Hours Bill0   That was taking the field with the owners against us and in despite of the Commission1s report
SIR A. STEEL MAITLAND: I am sorry you should think so, but the point was this, that after you had quite definitely refused to carry out what the Report clearly says on page 235 about meeting the present situation by an adjustment in wages at the time, the only alternative to give was to allow of there being a longer working day in order that the reductions might not be so great.

M.R. RICHARDS: Why should the Government do it? I want to make another point. You refer to the district arrangements and the impossibility of the uniform minimum. That is the employers&apos; contention, the coalowners&apos; contention, but haven&apos;t you been struck by the fact that there is a uniform  minimum, the equivalent of a uniform minimum, in all these district proposals? It might just as well have been a national one, only it is lower than we have been asking for, otherwise all these district proposals contain a similar minimum.

MR. C?: The point, Sir Arthur, is this. It is quite definitely stated here, and I am sure you will agree "The standard length of the working day which is now on the average seven and a half hours underground should remain unaltered". That is the statement in the Report. Then you have also this in the Report which is so often quoted 

"Before any sacrifices are asked from those engaged in the industry, it shall be definitely agreed between them that all practicable means for improving its organisation and increasing its efficiency should be adopted as speedily as the circumstances in each case will allow".  Really I think you have put it rather high. We may or may not have exaggerated the benefits accruing from reorganisation. We said, as you remember, that there were certain, methods which would take years to fructify and may or may not amount to very much, but it was stated that, after they
had been put in operation,,  and you agreed, it ie not necessary to Iceep obsolete mines goingf physically obsolete mines; they may be financial obsoletee    You had said that yourselves and agreed.   We have to consider it,    I say again the first point would be - let everyone realise that the mining industry,, rathhr than have one hundred pits working three or four days a week had &quot;better have eighty pits working six days a week, until the demand has increased, but there i3 surely some line of accommodationc   You say to us now - what have you to put f crward?MR,  CHURCHILL:    Exact ly0MR.  CQGKEM   The point is this  on hours, quite early the Prime Minister agreed that the workmen&apos;s representatives would not  consider anextension of the working days and. the Report agrees on that,    The second point was the question of dealing with certain methods of r e organ! sat ion which everybody agreos are necessary.     We may have exaggerated that or we may not, but there is something in that 9   How much we do not know,   We cannot tell until it is developed.    Ther is, the question of royalties which perhaps is more psychclogical than financial.    There is something in all these things 8    You can quite see the point we are putting The raazi such as the lowest paid miner says the position of tho worst paid man should be safeguarded a,e at present by a subsistence allowance.   We have the man at 7/6d a day.    We have 8/9d in Yorkshire.    We have 8/**-%&amp; in Wales, They would be reduced,    Thate  of course, put their backs up.    They felt - here is a man getting &amp;/**-%&amp;e he is to be reduced; here is the royalty owner and nobody is going
to reduce him.    You can see the psychology of the man, for whah it is worth,    how if sacrifices are to be called for in an industry the sacrifices ought to be shared as equally as possible.    On hours we say no.    On national minimum^     WQ fQel^ as we i-,aYe pointed out, that some consideration can be given.    It is a question which can be discussed;MR.  CHURCHILL:    You mean consideration can be given to district variations?ili,   COOK!    They can be discussed when we are     y discussing a national agreement.    I am not  committing anybody n-y&amp;.You know quite well that it Thorc arcdoes not mean a uniform national wage j h /    basisnaturally.ratesin the country which are never interfered with/   Itis only a percentage on those basis rates in the various districts,    Supposing,  for instance,, the wage was the1921 agreement with twenty per cent, instead of thirty-,three and a, third per cent - we have had during varyingperiods of prosperity different percentages being paidin the various districts, according to the prosperityin those districts,or otherwise of the industry/ buta of course, the minimum was there all the time     Well now that i,s a question, to be discussed in the light of facts0    In South Wales,  to take an export district^  there will be a number of collieries which will have to shut down under any system.   You cannot have nl-CFf  collieries developing and obsole-&apos; e collieries retained.    1 know that quite well,3IR. CHURCHILL:    Hot -whole districts blotted out? MR.  COOK:    Oh   nc.        You made a speech recently 20.
in which you misquoted myself and the President,    Therewere no shorthand notes,    I do not think you would wilfullythe mendo it.     We have never&apos;said      j must emi.grate orgo on the dole0   We say that the obsolete pits must go out.There is the pit losing 7/-, there is the pit losing5/*- and the pit losing 2/- and another pit making a profit, all with the same seam of coalQ    It may not bethe fault of the manager 0    It may be due to theobsolescence of the pit.    It may be a question of finance,,because he cannot buy the required irrvproved machinery.,generaliseIt may be many things *    You do not want to/too widelyon this.   We all make mistakes in propaganda speeches.    I am as guilty as anybody else.    Everybody puts their own point of view, but it is not the whole tmth. Isn&apos;t there some way of calling the two sides together with a view to discussing a national agreement to see what we can arrive at?   We can then see if there is any accommodation for disagreements instead of starting by saying hard and fast f we cannot do this and we cannot do that o    It should not be taken as a sign of weakne2s that people want to negotiate a settlement.MR.  CHURCHILL:    Certainly not .MR. COOK:   Because we have got to agree some time.    Either we have got to have an agreement that is going to be signed by both sides,  or       an agreement that is going to be imposed,and you know enough of the world and of men to know that an imposed agreement would be kept as long as it could be imposed and const ant agit at i on would be going on to remove it.    It means no kind of developed stability in an industry that^  for development, needs some continuity.
mr, r1c1aki)s0j.\! :      Sir Arthur  Steel   Haiti and lias kept reminding us that the Government have tried to he neutral in this thingc    I am going to put one or two points.    I think it would he admitted that the owners had a good opportunity of putting their case before the Coal Commission and they did put up a case for a longer working day before the Coal Comnvission and I think the Go7errjiTwnt-mis bound to admit that the Coal  Commission decideddefinitely in favour of the workmen against any extensionof hours. The only reference they make with regard totothat is that if the two sides like       mutually/agree in regard to hours they may be allowed t o do so,  but they personally,  and the whole of them signed the Report, hoped it would not be done.      As Mr.Evan Williams said last week:-&quot;We have strenuously held that view and expressed it to you,   and quite candi dly and openly we have exerted ourselves to the fullest extent possible to persuade the Government of this country,  through th Cabinet and the Houses of Parliament, that it was absolutely essential that the prohibition which existed to working more than seven hours a day should be removed,  and that it should be legal to work eight hours a day in the mines.    That is a view which is held by coalowners throughout the country.    And whatever means may be employed to discuss terms of employment,  or of discussing wages that may be payable by the collieries in the countr that Act has to be taken into full and complete consideration as being intended to be implemented by the owners and the country.&quot;
m, :I want to submit this.    That is in direct contradiction to the findings of the Commission - set up by this Government,   We say we are entitled to take up this posit ion,  that you have here your own Commission^ findings and there is a proven case against the coalownera.    Now with regard to district  settlements.,  again before the Commission, this was discussed and the Commission is very definite that it is in the interests of the industry there should be a national settlement. .  -    &quot;     * ...They say to us now - we are neither in a position nor are we empowered to discuss a national aggreement o   What I want to draw your attention tois thisj  that during the whole of that  Commissionthey put in evidence from the national standpoint c.Not a. single district representative was brought in,  as a district representative.- 3 3 o&amp;BflBMintt3GS&amp;i.

And, as we have put before them, we have more informatics from the national standpoint to settle national agreements than.the districts have * Th.&apos;.t is something wa have proved,.But it has come   up   again, and there is agreement betweenthe owners andyourselves in favour of district agreements.yThat is the impression created among the men, mid we will benowpleased to know if that is true, things are /better from the-i countryfestandpoint Wouldyou not apnly that to the power of resistance of the men?tooThey are able to stand it/ and you may take it&apos; from me that,whilst there ma$: be a little defte^son,    there is no weakeningas far as the organised . is conoexmed,    There is an impression in the-coalfield that you ar6 very much ooncernedabout financo     - quite right too, but what the men in the street cannot understand is this - that you can find moneyeasilyto fight the owners1 battle far more/than youonnto put the industry on its feet,    That is what the men feel, that it is taking more money to fight the miners, to get them to accept longer hours,  to accept district agreements,  which are contrary ts the Report of the Commission, and to accept a reduction in wages in spite of the Commission stating in definite terms that the wages are lower than they would d6sire them to b6. If money can be found for that,  would it not have better re- -suits if it could be found - I do not say indefinitely - to give the men a decent wage whilst reorganising, and if that could be done for a definite time,  it would help to finish the thing, and we could get down to reorganising things,   Yfould not that be a better peace settlement than asking the men to make a further sacrifice&apos;   We are told that these men axe to b6 re-duced from 7/6 to 6/8-jVd a day.    It is a most inhuman thing to ask men to live on 6/8-jVd a day,  and if money can be found to A
carry on this fight,&apos; the money would be better spent in settlingparticularly no&quot;; that there is a means of bringing in a settlement.    I have understood that the big thing the Govern-merit were sticking against is that ii&quot; &quot;we do      . find money there will be no hope of a settlement&quot;.    I think there is some hope of a settlement, and we think it is not unreasonable to ask that the money which is being used for fighting should be used for estub1ishihg peaceMR. CHURCHILL:    We are not. finding money for fighting in this.    The employers and you are fighting each other, and we find that owing to the fight going on between you the country is in such a situation that we have to spend money to ensure that the people get their food, and that businesses are carried on as far as possible.   Y&apos;Je are bound to do our best to carry that on.    That is quite a different thing to paying a special subsidy to a particular industry, because then all the other industries would have claims too, and there are industries other than coal that would jump at a subsidy at the present time,MR. COOK:    And what about the hours?MR. CHURCHILL:    As far as the Eight Hours Bill was con-cerned, we have said again and again that the miners ought toor half hourhave a ohoice in certain districts between an extra hour/or avery low rate of wages.    They ought to have the choice, and thelaw. said they should not have the choice,  and we took steps tv restriction.remove that/        When you say that obsolete mines should be shut down, I agree-. Bat wo have first to see how many are to be shut down at once * Are they to be shut down before there are others to take the miners, and so on? . We have been tola -and the Commission made a careful report on the subject - that on the basis of a uniform 7 hours and the rate of wages which the men got,  as many as over a third of the pits would be  shutdown either permanently or for a very long time.    That is a25
4       frightful thing to contemplate.) You gentlemen haveto manage your affairs, and I know how difficult they are.Apart from ovarything else, I sympathise with you in your task;But i t so era s to me we were not going bsyond where it was right for a Government to go to say at any rate if it is a questionof whole districts being blotted out with all the local in-some increase in the wording dustries dependent upon them -all blotted out,  or/as a tern-porary measure in a particular industry, that is a matter that may fairly be put to you for consideration at the presenttime *    That is, our position,,    I know you do not agree with it. as you have taken up this other line, but it comes tothis. Supposing we were to go to the owners tonight and say&quot;You come and meet the miners at a three-cornered conferenceand see if we can hammer out a settlement&quot;, they would say at once &quot;Is there anything new; we have explored all this for months, but there is nothing new&quot;,    I wondered if therewas something new on the tip of your tongues except this olddemand for a subsidy-   We cannot do this now; we have beenput to all this suffering and struggling, and we have triedvery hard - the Minister of Labour and the Prime Minister -and everyone knows it would be a great feather in the cap ofhavethe Government if the matter could/b^onsettled and avoided and so on, but nothing new has come forward.    I certainly did hope - I did not expect it, but I did hope-that perhaps to-day you or perhaps Mr.* Smith or Mr. Richards would have said straight out across this table &quot;This thing has got to be stopped; we know we have to giv6 something here and there, and this is what we con do if we can get a settlement&quot;.    If that was a real advance, then our good offices would be used to explore&apos;and further the matter with the utmost desire that good might result, but we have heard nothing new this26
evening; the only thing we have heard is a request lor finan-oial assistance *MR. COOK:    Upon what terms; what do you mean by something new?   Shall we get down to trass tacks?MR:. CHURCHIIiTj :    Have you anything to suggest to us: would yo\i like to consult with one another in another room,?Have you anything to suggest which       in your opinion aspractical men is likely to alter the situation?MR, RICHARDS:    The suppositions, have been that with reor-ganisation and with better selling arrangements and with someindustryamalgamations and other things this     J      could be put on a very much better basis than it was when we stopped work, and you ask us what we specially put to you?     We have to emphasise this.   7/6 have been asked to make  the whole of the sacrificefrom our wages until these things are put right,  and that^ *       employers,       &apos;s-&apos;/,very fact removes the pressure from     &apos; /&apos; &apos;        an^ they will go on in their old slipshod fashion as they have gon6 since Ihave known it.    I have been actively engaged in South Walesfor 40 years,  and for the whole of that time the best coal in   .-.the world has been recklessly drawn and sent away at nothinglike its commercial value.MR. CHURCHILL:    You mean the transferred coal?MR, RICHARDS:    No, between 50 and 60 million tons a year produced and nobody making anything out of it,  only the Managing Directors and their friends and agents and their ships and railways and other industries they are interested in. Remove this pressure from them by lowering wages, and there will be no reorganisation   done to put the industry into a   . he-tier position. &apos; If the Government would render some finan-cial help for the moment,  the Government could then exercisq pressure which wo think would be good; but it is an admitted
kresponsibility of the Government to try and bring pressure toget this industry into a better condition.    Of course there b regard tois another side to the story in/the prosperity of the country0MR. CHURCHILL:    I would not say the country was prosperous.I would say it was far less injured than I expected0MR&quot;. RfCHAR&quot;13:    The country- must have cheap coal, and nowyou are here prosperous and paying double the price for theeoal we were prepared to get It for.    That is our difficulty.ffe think - not because of the question of wages - though thatis a very ser&amp;ous thing - but also there are other ramifica-tions of this thing, and for that reason temporary financialassistance is of the greatest importance, and then the Govern-sssnt should use its fullest powers to see that these reformsindicated shall be carried out.    I agreed with you when it wasintimated to us some time ago that it was no use giving us ann-ther subsidy unless we could see  some finality.    I agree now.As Mr, Richardson said, a body of the men we represent have forsome reason or other been very hostile to arbitration in settling what- their standard of living shall be , but we havethe great bulk of the men with us and ne can get re-startsdagain, but there must be some finality in the arrangement waenter into.   We ask you to examine this thing in all its bear-ings and see &quot;Which is the lesser cost,    You want to examinethe cost of keeping the s6 men you are sending to prison in such.large numbers unfortunately recently and all the police move- ;tnents that have taken place.    The longer this thing continues-it must not be said that I believe in its necessity, but fromthe very nature of things&quot; that kind of thing ismore acutelikely to become/from now on. If this attempt again is goingto be futile, we shall be left in this dilemma - we cannot get a settlement on lines that will be equitable,  there is nothing for it but to fight it out or give it up.    We are not
in a temper yet to give it up.MR. CHURCHILL t    Let m6 say once again what I said at the outset, that if you have some proposals to make to us in any way you like to make them,  confidentially, openly or vorbally - if you have any proposals to put to us whioh will constitute a new situation, we shall see that those proposals are transmitted to the other side, and naturally we shall do our best to take advantage of anything in those proposals ^n&quot;show that the two sides were coming together, on the issues at stake.    Do not let me lead you inte the mis-conception that I do npt realise how greatly the country is suffering by what is going on.   You are suffering, thecountry is suffering, everybody is suffering, but there is tho oountry^sno doubt of if   capacity to continue? I&apos;hat is all I wish to say to indicate the difference b6-tween being and \vell-heing.MR. RICHARDS;   When you are talking about        financialassistance to the mining industry of the country, you are  -talking about an entirely different thing &quot;to --fi-jawooi.il assistance toother in-dustries of this country, because after all,  a great part of the trouble in this industry was due to the war, and d^e t its special treatment by the Government.    They took over control of it,  they decided how it should be managed, how much money should be given to the- industry,  and having cut out the export trade, we were cut out from the rest o&apos;p th world.    I am not complaining about it.    If I had been in control,. I should have taken hold of the Welsh coal as hard as possible to save men at sea, but every time the Govern-ment have considered the problem,  the fact that we were cut
tMoil from the world end all our markets v/ers gone by Govern-meat control- all  that has had itsjeffect upon this industry.- tho -minors ij1And     /    say too &quot;\7e had    to fight/the mining corrmuxnity&quot;because of the control of our industry    Unlike other in-dustries,  or a large number of them, where any increase ofwageswas asked they got it, we had   to fight every time,while other industries got their incomes increased far and above what we have ever got,  and we do. say the Government andthe country is indebted to the mining industry,  and. shouldnot be squeamish about a ifew million pounds to try and put iton its feetocoulc! beMR. COOK:    We fslt that there    /    some proposals,   upon T/hioh you could call the two sides together and be prepared as a Government to lend your best offices to help towards a settlement,MR. CHIJRC5HIIjL -    Not proposals of subsidise, but some-thing that alters the situation.,MR. COOS:    What do you mean by new proposals - some prn-. posal for a lower national minimum for instance than what existed? -*MR.  CHURCHILL:    Wa tho -ght really that these proposalsought to come from you.   We can easily suggest what is thebest solution for both sides, but we have not the power of enforcing it, and it is really for you to say what you think.We. have made many proposals in the paste    The Prime Ministerwrote a letter making suggestions,  but it is really for n or.&quot;.you to do that / ^nd let me say that tho door is open if you have proposals to make at any time, but after all, we areIhe&apos;y anylooking at realities.&quot; j ysem   ratherdour. j Vfe arc looking at the realities of thecaso; you have to face the hard, facts of the case, and ynuknow the facts as well as aw do.   You know what matters and30
1.87what does not nutter, and if at any tine you feel able to make a proposal which alters the position, in a manner which is substantial naturally, if we are satisfiedthat it is something that leads to a hope of bringing the two sides nearer to an agreement, we should exert ourselvesat once, but we cannot give you or the other side in the matter assurances *   We have to try and carry on as well as we can during your * quarrel.MR. RICHARDS:    Supposing we are prepared to give some proposals, are you then prepared not to rule out among these proposals the  question of some financial assistance?MR. OHTJRCHILIi:    Wo, we cannot give financial assistance,I mean Government financial assistance.    If the industry arrangeda loan in its own way, that does not affect the Government,but there can be no loan from the Government, nor a subsidy.MR. RICHARDSOH:    So your lifeboat is not going to be launched?MR. CHURCHILL:    My lifeboat has already sunk.MR. RICHARDS Oil:    You wasted a lot of money on the lifeboat last year, and we claim that every man is entitled to a decent&apos; living wage.MR. SMITH:    All I can say in conclusion is that you and your friends say this &quot;If you have anything to give away,  tellus how much you have to give away, and wo will -cell you how to dispose of it&quot;   If you say &quot;We wash our hands of it froma financial point of view&quot;, I do not think we need troubleyou any more.    You say &quot;if we are prepared to do this- theywill be prepared to negotiate with, us at one 6^0 doubts.That is tho position.    When Sir Arthur says there has been no alteration at all, I want to know what you mean by no altera-tion.    If anybody agrees to take the report and take itsfindings they are prepared to face that position even if it31
m6ans to an extent a reduction in wages, &quot;but we must have some signs that the report is going to be put into operation,     I went down the pit in 1873; I have had a fair innings.    The question Is what are- you going to do to compel them to reorganise that is what we want you to do.   We do not want, to thank you for nothing.32
MR.  CHURCHILL:    I Co riot rerlly quite und erst and why you Con&apos;t consider, that the Bill - I am nor only on the point of re-organisation - I do not understand why you consider the Act of Parliament we have passed is not in anyway a in ems of carrying forward th e re-organisations Let me point out so far as I nay - I am prepared to he contradicted, I en only aware of one important point on which ir departs from the recommendations of the Royal Commission and that is the point about mining royalties.    Now I can -quite see it would help the miners if the royalties were bought toy the State and the whole of the proceeds given the miners.    That is not the proposal of the Royal Commission. The proposal of the Royal Commission Is that a fair market value should be paid for these royalties and that I as Chancellor of the Exchequer on behalf of the State should receive what the royalty owners receive now having given them public money instead.    I have had it worked out.    I believe it could be done so that in the first few years there would be no great loss to the State.      On the other hand it would be very inconvenient to borrov? the necessary money at the present time.    From a financial point of view it may not make a great difference to the State.    It makes no difference to you and the only thing is the psychological effect,    why - the miners should feel it would be better psychologically because a hundred millions in hard cash is handed over to the royalty owners I cannot understand.    I should not feel psychologically improved in my noodaMR. HERBERT SMITH:    Is not that looking at It a bit flippantly, that it Is going to be no benefit to the
miners.    It came out in the Commission that you had acolliery which had been searching for coal to see whethercoal was proved lore and whether it was proved two miles away.       70,000 was said to be spent in boring and when they found the coal they said for all the tine this colliery is working we must have 1^-3. for every ton of coal so long asit does net exceed a million a year.    So soon as you exceeda million a year it must be 1-Jd. and then another man comesalong and says where do I come in and he gets  16 a squareyard and than you talk about it flippantly.    It is real.    TheBill says the ovaters can talk for three years about amalgamationsand if they cannot do anything at the end of three years they go theto/Cabals and Railways Commission and see what can be donein that direction,.. lake the song ,TIt may be for years and it may he for ever&quot; before amalgamation comes.MR.  CHURCH ILL:    Our sincere and honest belief Is that our Act,  apart from the question of mining royalties which would not be any financial service to the miners at the present time, does fully meet the proposals of the Commission and we are determined to put then into operation with the utmost vigour in our power.    That is on this particular point of re-organisation.MR. RICHARDS:    Of course the royalties would have raid off the loan would they not&apos;MR. COOK:      It is a lot more, than psychological, the reduction that is being asked of the lower paid men who are the first to be sacrificed all the time.  One does not want to make propaganda;   we want a settlement.MR.  CHURCHILL:    Let me finish by saying there is no reason why our discussion this afternoon should be the last word at all.    If at any time you feel you need the help of
the Government of the country you are entitled to oceae-,but bo far nothing has appeared which in any way armsus.with the means to advance matters towards a settlement.The only request that has teen mads, the only request&quot;and it   &apos;has now toon made by all four of your gent lorjaen - has h-sen fora r-enewal of financial assistance and we hav.a definitelystated that after all that has happanod - after the financialassistance we have given, after the great loss we have suffered - we are not prepared to. ask Parliaasnt to do that.But on othor matters If you wish tq come to see us or tosee tho Minister of Labour It is onr duty to see you and .you know psrfeotly well ho77 wo should rajoico if a settlement could be reached.     We would rather have a settlement reached by an agreement to which both parties put their names thantho struggle by   / being&quot;fought out to the bitter end,MS. 000s;    That is bettor for everybody.MS.&quot; CHUROIIILJi;    It is hotter for everybody, but we have made our financial contribution and we cannot make any further one.     So far as rs-organisation is concerned you are powerfully represented in Parliament, and if you can show us we are falling short in vigour In&apos;putting that Act into operation you can bring it to our attention in the proper place, but certainly otir intention is to put it into operation at full speed.     Any settlement yon can make with the owners.will be better than what Is going on now from our&quot; point of view, but we seo no reason why district settlements and a national settlement should not be combined in the same way as you have a schedule to an Act of Parliament,i iis:MR. HERBERT SMITH:    Tho difficulty is/your saying you will he7..p puts me in mind of a man in the river drowning
side&apos;and a man on the bank saying if you come in to the        &quot; anddrag yourself out I will   wipe your feet. We are not goingto settle  on any  terms.  I am going  to fight a bit yet. Iam nearly  65 and there is a bit  of fight  in the old dog still,.We have said all that the Report has ashed us  to say,frontexamine it,  take it  from    /     to baok and take its results and I say when we come to the sixth point we areprepared to deal with    the sixth point but we are notprepared   to say at  once we.will give a reduction of wages to help the employers.MR. CPIURGHI1L:    We will provide you with a oopy of the transcript.    I must  tell you I propose on behalf of the Government  to publish a  statement  saying in short what we consider has occurred here, but if we can agree upon the statement  that would  . be more satisfactory, but something has got to be done.  I want, to talk quite frankly. We do not  believe there is any advantage gained by an air of mystery hanging over the whole scene and people thinking a lot is- goinp on and we are negotiating. We think it \should be known that there is an advance to a solution or  that there is no advance.MR. COOK:    My point is this, in order that nobody shall say  this has been said and that has been said I would rather the whole report was published,;MR. CHURCHILL:    I have not a word to say againstt hat.MR. COOK:    So much gets manufaotured . The imagination of some pressmen is wonderful.MR.CHURCHILL: Shall we agree on a statement or if not, shall we decide on what statement we are going to make? We will send y ou a oopy. If there is anything you object to
JL al 3In It you can cheok it.      Perhaps you would have amooting with Mr. Jones,MR, JO RES:      I have prepared a short statement for:the press os follows:&quot;The whole situation was discussed.      The minors representatives renewed their request for further financial assistance from the Government.     This was definitely refused by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,     The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Labour repeated the willingness of the Government to render any assistance in resuming negotiations with the owners, provided the proposals put forward were likely to l-^d to a new situation. A verbatim report of the proceedings will be issued to the press -tomorrow&quot;,MR. COOK:      If you publish that, may I say I think that is put unfairly.     You have started with the whole position of the financial business.      It is quite true it has been put forward but that is not the    ominant thing that has been decided or discussed.      If you could suggest that a meeting was held between the two sides and the miners1 representatives discussed, the whole position with the Government regarding future settlement regarding financial help, in the li lit of the fact that a full report is going to be given it does not matter if you are not very definite.MR. CHURCHILL: .   As the report is going to be published it is not of very great consequence    but I think it is important that it should be made clear there is no change in the situation so far as we are concerned because the only thing we have been asked specifically upon we are not able to do,MR, COOK:      But let us not start at the opening now on a stunt which may be propagated by the press of different colours before the full report is published.      It does give the Idea we have come simply on that,
MR. CHURCHILL:      I think we should agree on some neutral words and then publish the report.      The alternative is for you to give your version, for you to say we met the Government, we were very disgusted with their attitude, but if we can agree on something neutral I think it would be better. Anyhow we do not want to do anything to damage the prospect of our meeting again.MR, COOK:      That is my ideacMR. CHURCHILL:      It is agreed the report, while giving the truth,  should net be coloured in either way and Mr, Cook and Mr. Jones will just rough up something and if they wish to consult the others they will do so,  but if they are both agreed on the matter the statement can be published,SIR A.  STEEL MA IT LAND:      It is impossible for a dozen people to discuss it,- MR. CHURCHILL:      V/e will give you a copy of the proceedings.     You can look through them and if you. are misreported in any way you can correct it.      We will make a perfectly fair, honourable and readable report of what has taken place,(The proceedings then terminated).
