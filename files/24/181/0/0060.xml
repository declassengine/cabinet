pTRJ2gptJMEKTT 13 THE PKOPilKTY 0F Hls BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 SJlC^gJiNHBjj^? 7Jc RE T.CABINET:360(26.Copy No,COMPULSORY ARBITRATION committee memorandum BY THE CHANCELLOR OF TEE DUCHY OF LANCASTER,Though I am very grateful to my colleagues for the  impartial-tiality with which they have set out arguments in favour of the conditional acceptance by the British Empire of the compulsory competence of the Permanent Court of Justice in justiciable disputes,  I should like to be allowed to state as briefly as I can the reasons which have led me to differ from the conclusion against that course which has been adopted by the majority of the Committee.There seem to me to be three questions on the answers towhich depends the policy which we should adopt.1. Is it desirable that judicial decision should take the place of war as a means of settlement of justiciable International disputes?To this question I submit an affirmative answer should be given.It is true that a judicial decision will not always be satis-factory.    But war on modern conditions  is such an appallingalternative that the decision of any reasonably trustworthytribunal  (I will give my reasons for thinking that thePermanent C oxirt is trustworthy) would be far preferable,  apartfrom the fact that too often war decides nothing.It may be said that there are many justiciable interna-tional disputes not in the least likely to lead to war whichare at present either settled by negotiation or left unsettled. These are for the most part,  if not altogether, disputes of a minor character.    As far as they can be settled by negotiation that method of settlement will remain unaffected except that the possibility of a judicial decision in the background will hasten the negotiations,  assuming as I do assume that in the great majority of cases,   we only want what Is just and right. If they cannot be settled by negotiation it is far better to reach a solution by judicial decision rather than to allow the controversy to dran; on with the possibility that at a given
fflcaont it may &quot;beocxae a serious menace to peace.2. Would acceptance by us of compulsory judicial decision in justiciable disputes hare an important influence in promoting the general substitution of judicial decision for war as a means of settling such disputes? Here again I think an affirmative answer should be given.      Our international influence is very great.     Many states habitually guide their ecuduct tc a very large extent by curs.     At present there is a movement towards judicial decision of justiciable international disputes.     many minor countries have&apos;accepted it and recently France and Belgium have followed suit.     It is understood that Germany is considering the matter.      If she and we were to decids in favour of the policy here advocated it is probable that Italy ana Japan would do the same.-     Even though the Unite! States and Russia took a different view I think they would be in such an event almost alone.     ITc doubt there would 3tj.ll remain outside the scope of judicial treatment the minor disputes to which I nave referred, and the purely political iisput.es such as that which arose ever the kosul oounaary. i)ut it can scarcely oe doubted that a general acceptance of compulsory judicial decision for justiciable disputes would oe a very important step rewards discrediting war.5. Notwithstanding the advantages claimed as a result of an affirmative answer tc the first two questions, -would compulsory judicial decision of justiciable international disputes involve such risks for the British jiirapira that it should net be acceptea? I cannet think sc.In the first place, let us see what the suggested change actually amounts to.      iby articles 12-15 of the Covenant $ny dispute between members cf %ie League likely tc lead tc a rupture must be..referred to the Council for inquiry under Art. IB unless it is -sent to arbitration, cr judicial settlement. Tuis includes justiciable as well as non-justiciable disputes.
3y Article 17 these provisions are extended to non-members if they are prepared to accept the obligations of membership for the purpose, of the dispute0   *n the Corfu case it was held that the Council was bound to accept a statement by either pa;;-ty to the dispute that it was likely to lead to a rupture    It follows that as things stand any state can take us before the Council in any dispute provided it alleges that it is likely&apos;to lead to a rupture.    If we accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court and the other party has done the same, then either of us can insist on baking the dispute if it is justificiable to the Court instead of to the Councils    It is quite true that under Article 15 only a unanimous decision of the Council has an coercivie&apos;-  effects   But a decision by a majority - certainly if the majority was considerable - would in practice hare to be accepted by us unless it were flagrantly unjustj,   Even then if we rejected the decision we should be in an exceedingly awkward position^   ITow I do not agree with my colleagues that the Council is &quot;admittedly weak,&quot;   But I do think It not at all well fitted for judicial decisions    Its personnel consists of politicians and diplomatists directly representative of their governments and amenable therefore to any gust of popular opinion that may sway their chiefs0    In both the Upper Silesian case and In the Mosul case, though the eventual deoisions were tolerable? no one can say that the atmosphere in which they were given was impartial,,My colleagues are disturbed last if we accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court, Egypt might tak- us therec Until she is a member of the League ahe oould not do Bot but she could now take us to the Councils   In any dispute with Egypt that I can foresee I should have no fear of a judicial decisions What the Council would do is much more doubtfulo   Even if we
secured a bare majority of its members that would be a Pyrrhic victory,      la a dispute &quot;between the British 3:apire and .&apos;3gypt nothing much short of a unanimous decision in our favour would be satisfactory.      My colleagues who were at Geneva, during the Mosul discussions will remember our anxiety lest even Sweden should vote against us.There is a suggestion in the draft memorandum for the Imperial Conference that the permanent Court may not be juste This is put on two grounds.      First,  it is said that our rules of evidence do not apply in its proceedings.    I doubt if they apply in the proceedings of any international body or for the matter of that in any non-English-speaking Court of Justice.        In the Council of course,  there are no rules of evidence whatever. Secondly,  it is suggested that the method, of appointing the judges makes it possible that they will be exposed to influence, In addition to a number of minor provisions designed to secure the impartiality and fitness of the judges,  the following are worth notingo ,    They are appointed by a majority vote of the Council conf.ira.ied by a majority vote of the Assembly.      They have to be chosen from candidates previously selected by the members of the Hague Court of Arbitration0      They hold office for nine years certain unless the colleagues of one of them unanimously dismiss him.      Ifot more than one judge can belong to any one nation.        That -.all of them will be altogether free from national prejudice it would be unreasonable to claim.      But I have never heard any responsible person charge them with partiality though the Court has given some twenty opinions, some of them in matters very warmly contested.      In one ca.se a French judge has given his opinion contrary to the views &quot;put forward by his Government.    As far as I know during all the discussions in the United States Senate as to whether they should or should not join the Court,  no suggestion was made that the Court had shewn partiality in its decisions,.    It h as never &quot;been alleged anywhere that any Government has given directions
to the  judge belonging to its nationality as to how he should decide any case.    I believe the Court to be thoroughly just and upright and certainly far less open to suspicion than the Council.It is said that if we accepted tho  jurisdiction we should abide by our undertaking whereas foreign countries are not so trustworthy.    There nay be truth in this belief,  though a similar belief is held equally strongly by every other country in the world.    I found it very rampant in the United States of America.    All the saiue there is no modern instance that I can recollect of a country accepting arbitration and then refusing to carry out an arbitral award.    If it is meant that having agreed to refer justiciable disputes to the Court a country might refuse to do so when one occurred, that could only be done by disobeying the decision, of the Court who are to decide whether a dispute In such a case  is or is not justiciable. If one cf the parties to the dispute did not appear the Court would proceed in its absence.Finally it is said that on constitutional grounds we ought not to accept the Court&apos;s jurisdiction because  (1) we cannot be sure that Parliament or the self-governing dominions would allow is to carr;y out the decisions,  and (2) because it might lead to inter-imperial disputes being referred to the Court.    Oh the first point we could if necessary guard our-selves by a reservation,  though since on its Parliamentary side this objection must apply to most other countries I should have thought it scarcely necessary.    On the second point,  I have always held that disputes between ourselves and the Dominions are not international    and so are outside the purview of all these Articles in the Covenant;    and the same observa-tion applies  to immigration.     (See too Art.15, para.  8). But if any doubt is felt on the matter it could also be
settled by a reservation.   Here, too,  if the Dominions wish to make trouble it would be better for us if they went to the Court than to the Council,(Intld.)        R.C.23rd October,  1926.
