In the main they relate to persons who had claims 10 benefit current and were not at work on the dates given.(2.) The figures above for the four weeks in September are exclusive of persons in the Goal-mining Industry who ceased work on account of the dispute which commenced on the 1st May.(3.)

The wholly unemployed figure has again increased.(C.) -Unemployment in Insured Industries.The latest date for which unemployment figures by industries are available is the 20th September, 1926, at which date the percentage unemployed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 13&apos;9, as compared with 14*2 at the 23rd August, 19.26, with 12&apos;0 at the 21st September, 1925, and with 10-6 at the 22nd September, 1924. The figures at the 20th September in respect of industries showing appreciable variations in unemployment during the month, together with the increase or decrease as compared with the previous month, with the 26th April, 1926, and with a year ago are given in the table below : Industry.Number of Insured Persons recurded as Unemployed at Sept. 20, 1926.Increase (-(-) or Decrease (-) compared with Aug. 23, 1926.April 26, 1926.1Sept. 21, 1925.All Insured Industries. .Pottery, Earthenware, &amp;c.

The improvement was most marked in the Pottery Industry, which showed a decrease of over 11,000. The slight recovery which, as the above table shows took place in the Iron and Steel Industries, was also largely confined to the Midlands. In most of the other heavy metal centres, the position in these industries and in the allied Engineering Trades would appear to have become somewhat worse, only five blast furnaces being reported as

In the &quot;Woollen and Worsted Industries the decrease in unemployment was largely of a seasonal nature, and chiefly evident amongst women operatives. Other textiles which showed some improve-ment were Linen and Jute.The principal increases in unemployment during the month were amongst seasonal trades. These were probably somewhat higher than usual owing to prevailing industrial uncertainty and the inadequacy of fuel supplies. The increase in unemployment in the Cotton. Industry is noteworthy, as with a further reduction.in the price of raw cotton some improvement in this industry might have been expected. It must be remembered, however, that only about one-sixth of -those reported as out of work in this industry are wholly unemployed. The position in the Shipbuilding Industry became still more unsatisfactory especially on the Clydeside, where the discharges of men during the month were heaviest. At the end of the month the percentage of unemployment in this industry had reached 41&apos;1 per cent.(D.)-Latest Figures.The latest figures of unemployment published are those for the 4th October, giving the total number on the registers as 1,572,700. This is an increase over the position on the 27th September amounting to 44,949, and an increase over a year ago of 275,072. The preliminary figure for the 11th October is 1,536,300, showing a decrease in one week of 36,400.ARTHUR STEEL-MAITLAND.
