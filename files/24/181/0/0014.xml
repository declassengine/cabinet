A.i)pmin i. on e 0 ffi c e .9th August,  1926.
Government House, Ottawa.17th  July,  1926.Sir,,I think it is now time to send you wJiat I believe to be a considered and unbiased appreciation of the political situation in which I have recently, found myself.In September last Mr. Mackenzie King asked me for dis-solution stating that while he was confident he could carry on the Government until 1927, when the&apos;natural term of Parliament would  expire, he felt that his position with a bare majority of one was precarious and prevented him doing full justice to the country and to his. Party, when any legislation he  contemplated might,  and often did, involve compromise with the third Party (Progressives). In other words he desired to appeal to the electors to give him a clear mandate .      In these circumstances I had no hesitation whatever in dissolving Parliament on his advi ce.Mr. Mackenzie King made his appeal and failed to obtain a definite mandate.      As I have said above, he had an absolute majority of one in the House of Commons.     In the General Election which followed, he was himself defeated and seven of his Ministers, and so far from having a majority he had only 101 seats to 116 of the Conservative Party, the balance, 28 seats, being Progressive,  labour and Independent.    Chat is to say, Mr. Mackenzie Sing lost 15 seats, while Mr. Heigh on gained 66 seats, there being 10 extra seats owing to redistribution.1.
In spite of the result of the Election, Mr. Mackenzie King told,pie that he considered that he had the constitutional right to remain in Offics until such time as Parliament decided that he could not carry on the Government.     While I strongly advised him against such an undignified, attitude, his right was undoubted and I asked him to form his Cabinet. We were both agreed that all alternative forms of Government should be tried before resorting to another Election.In June,  on the eve of a vote of censure and. to avoid defeat in the House of Commons, he again asked me for dissolution;    Progressive support had failed, him. and three motions behind which, his Government had thrown all their strength - though strictly speaking they were not Government motions     had been defeated.Mr. Mackenzie King had said in November it was for Parliament to decide.      In June Parliament was on the verge of making an adverse decision and he wished to shirk defeat by asking for dissolution,.     With a full realisation of the issues involved, I took the responsibility of refusing to dissolve Parliament and accepted the resignation which Mr. Mackenzie King, in consequence of my refusal, immediately handed me.     I then asked Mr. Meighen, who led. the largest Party In the House of Commons,  whether he could form a Government.      He assured me that he could and I    asked him to do so.      In announcing his resignation to the House of Commons Mr. Mackenzie King stated that I had refused, to grant him dissolution to which he said he believed ho was entitled under British constitutional practice.Three days later Mr.  Meighen&apos;s Government, which had been accorded somewhat erratic support by a :. action of the Progressive Party,  was defeated by one in a small House.
Mr. Meighen then, asked me for dissolution, which. I granted, Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s contention is that I should then have sent for him again, hut he loses sight of the fact that in the meantime the House of Commons had passed a vote of censure on his administration In connection with the report of the Gu s t Mr C omrni s s i on.I made my decision only after careful consideration of all the circumstances and more particularly the Interests of the Dominion, and fully recognising the responsibilities of my Office,      I consider that my action was entirely logical. Mr, King had appealed to Parliament for support, as he had told me in &quot;November he  thought he had a right to do. This support had failed him in June.I have etc.,(3d,)    BYNG OF VIMYThe Rt.Hori.L.S. Amery, &apos; M. P.,Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, London,2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I. 11th August,  1926.
