The Cabinet at their scooting on the 7th July last (Cabinet 45(26) Conclusion 6) requested the Committee to oonsider further some of the questions raised in their first Report,  and particularly the questions of the secret ballot,  picketing, and the immunity of trade unions from responsibility for wrongs, and to present a further report before the fiecess.In connection with their further discussions,  the Committee have been furnishe-&quot;&quot; by the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations with a valuable report of an enquiry directed&quot;by the Labour Advisory Sub-Committee of the Union,  and they have also had an interview with members of that Sub-committee before-A copy of this report accompanies,  and copies of the appendices referred to in it are available for any member of the Cabinet who may desire to see them.    The committee have also been favoured with copies of a preliminary Report (copy annexed) from a Sub-Committee on Trade Unions appointed by the Conservative Private Members  (1922) Committee; and they have bed an interview with members of that Sub-Committee.      They have also received a deputa-tion from the National Confederation of Employers1  Organisations.^With regard to the proposal for a compulsory secret ballot before a strike,  the overwhelming opinion of the Conservative and Unionist Associations consulted by the Labour Advisory Sub-Committee,, of the National Union was in favour of such a ballot; -fc&apos;ut the very representative body of employersThe Deputation consisted of -Mr. Roscoe Brunner.Mr.  Eva n &apos;iv i 11 ia m s.Sir J. Lithgow,  Bart.Sir E.W. Moir, Bart.Sir R.L. Wedgwood, C.B..C.M.G.Mr. D. Milne&quot;&quot;Watson.
who attended on bo ha If of tho national Confederation of Employ or a&apos; Organisations wore (with ono doubtful exception) strongly opposed to such a ballot.     Their view appeared to bo that, if a ballot wore taken on every proposal for a strike, the men *:70uld infallibly voto in favour of tho strike with a vk&quot; to strengthening tho hands of thoir Executive for the purpose of no go ticvt ion, and that such a vote once takGn would tond to exacerbate and prolong the dispute.     The National Confederation of Snployors will submit a formal report on this subj&amp;ct in October. The opinion of the Sub-Ocsmrait tee of Unionist lierabors of Parliament was also (with ono exception) against the proposed ballot,   In tho face of those opinions the Committee fool that they cannot at the present moment recommend tho Cabinet to propose a compulsory ballot; but they think that tho Bill might provide for liodel Rules for and against a strike ballot and that unions adopting and following such Rules should be entitled to free postage faoilitieo us regards the ballot.tfith regard to picketing, the further information laid before the Committee has strengthonvjd their opinion that tho right of &quot;peaceful persuasion&quot; given or confirmod by tjbo Act of 1906, ie? constantly abused, and that precautions should be taken against such abuse. They, therefore, recommend that the proposed Bill should contain provisions for (a) prohibiting picketing by agents of a trade union at a worker&apos;a homo;    (b) preventing the assembling of a crowd outside tho works for the purpose of intimidating workers or preventing thoia from working; and (c) requ&amp;ing a picket to woar a distinguishing hadgo.
As to the immunity from liability for torts provided by section 4 of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, the employers pressed for a total repeal of that provision.     The Committee remain of opinion that it is inexpedient to propose such a repeal at the present time, but the proposals which they are making to the Cabinet will to some extent affect the immunity provided by the section.The further evidence received by.the Committee has confirmed their view that all trade unions should henceforth be registered.      They also think that any alterations of the rules of trade unions should not take effect until registered.The Committee recommend that, if the Cabinet should generally approve their proposals, they should be requested to revise the draft Bill with a view to its being submitted to the Cabinet for approval in October next.Signed on behalf of the Committee.CAVE.

lift!(JEH BHlL     REPORTTHE; M A TUBE OF TEE EHQ.UIRY.On June 9th,  1926, a circular letter was issued by the Principal Agent of the Conservative Party to all the Consti-tuency Associations in England and vfeles suggesting that an early meeting of their labour Sub-Committees (or, failing that, of Trade Unionists on their Executive Committees) should be called &quot;with a view to ascertaining the general feeling with regard to the recent General Strike and the action of the Trade Unions,  and particularly with reference to any views which it was thought should be brought before the Government&quot;. Wo specific issue was mentioned, nor were any suggestions made as to the subject upon which opinions were desired,  in order that the Labour oub-Committees might be entirely free to express their opinions on any subject which might interest them, and might not feel constrained to offer opinions on issues presented by Headquarters..(Eor the actual text see Appendix I.)GENERAL OBSERVATIONS OS THE ORGANISATIONS CpilSULa?EI3.Replies have been received from 292 constituencies-    A large number of these are agricultural and have no close personal interest in the question.    The total number of oon-stituancies to which the circular letter was issued was 509, leaving a-balance of 217, which have not replied;    many of these also are agricultural districts, but a few important industrial districts have not answered.The names of the constituencies from whioh replies have been received are given in Appendix II to this Report.
The majority of constituencies .have complied with the request that they should consult either the Labour Sub-Committee or the Trade Union Members of their Executive, and in over 200 cases it is specifically stated that they have done so.The strongest and clearest expression of opinion undoubtedly comes from the industrial areas, and it is interesting to note that,  in a large number of these,  the Labour Sub-Committee is described as being composed almost entirely of   Trade Unionists; for example, at Ashton-under-Iyne, Birmingham (Duddeston and Sparkbrook), Grimsby, Hull, Morpeth, West Newcastle, Northampton, Nottingham (over 50 Trade Unionists present from all parts of the city), Preston,  Sunderland,  Tynemouth, Vfolverhampton,  Worcester, Essex (West Essex and Harwich), Gloucester (Thornbury), Hampshire (Winchester), Lincolnshire (Grantham), Middlesex (Harrow and Twickenham), Northumberland (Wansbeck),  Somerset (Wells),  Staffs, (Liehfield),  Warwick-(Rugby), Yorkshire (Cleveland).    In other cases,  there is nothing to show to what extent the members of the Labour Sub-Committees present were actually Trade Unionists, but the constitution of the labour Sub-Cor.mittees requires that they shall consist of wage-earners, not less than two or more than four,  representative of the working men and women from each Polling District Committee in the constituency.    In industrial areas,  every effort is made to secure that these Committees shall consist of Trade Unionists.Copies of some of the replies are given in -appendix 3. These have been selected,  not because they favour any particular view, but on account of their intrinsic interests as a fair and intelligent representation of working-class opinion..    It is particularly noticeable that by far the most intelligent (though none the loss emphatic) expressions of view come from those Committees upon which there is a large representation of the Trade Unions, especially in the Northern and Midland areas.
In a large number of oases, Labour Sub--Commit tees have been content with a few remarks of a general character upon the General strike, and have apparently not addressed their attention to any possible amendment of the law, this largely, no doubt, by reason of the fact that the oircular latter avoided asking for specific recommendations.    It is for this reason that the number of reports on those matters upon which there is general agreement (e.g.,  secret ballot - which is advocated by 144 constituencies) falls so far short of the total number of replies received.It should be noted that many of the meetings at which these reports were adopted were held before the meeting of the Central Council of the National Union on June 22nd,  at which Lord Birkenhead spoke on the Trade Union question, while some were held after, and that the meetings held before Lord Birkenhead&apos;s speech are just as emphatic in their recommendations as those held after.SUMMARY Off THE^RECOMJ^NBAjTIONS.A large number of miscellaneous suggestions was received,all of which are included in the statistical summary of the reportscontained in Appendix 4, but the outstanding feature of the returnsis the frequency with which reoommendations are made     on thefollowing questions:-(l)    That no strike should be legal without a secret ballot of the Trade Unions concerned.    (144 in favour -none against).(2)    That the abuses of picketing should be remedied o    (113 in favour - none against-)    (The majority.of the Committees who have expressed opinions on this are in favour of restrictions,   though over 40$. declare for abolition.)-   (3)    That the law relating to political levies should be amended.    (135 in favour.)    (While a large number . were in favour of repealing the irade Union Act of 1913, the majority desired an amendment of the law on the principle of &quot;contracting In&apos;T to subscribe to  the political levy,  instead of &quot;contracting out&quot; of the obligation.)In addition to the above, a number of recommenationswere made in favour of restoring the responsibility of Trade Unions and their officials at common lav/ for their wrongful acts.    (28 in favour).
In some cases, strong recommendations were made from industrial areas that no strike or lockout should he legal unless tile dispute be first referred to an industrial court for enquiry,    (25 in favour),In addition to the foregoing, and probably of greater importance,  there is running throughout these returns the viewthat there is something seriously wrong with Trade Unionmanagement,  that the rights of individual members are notprotected,  particularly in regard to funds, and that there isno security for proper administration, as in the case of othercorporate bodies.      Indeed, the reports appear to presentvery strong evidence that any measure that would secure the sound administration of Trade Unions would receive the general assent and support of the working classes irrespective of party.The following examples taken from individual reports are examples of this desireAll Trade Unions to be registered.Trade Union accounts to be audited by a public auditor.Copies of accounts to be supplied to all members.Registrars of Friendly Societies to have greater power of scrutiny of Trade Union accounts.Trade Union Benefit Funds and Strike Funds to be kept entirely separate.Wo strike to be legal without proper notice.The Trade Union Act of 1871 to be amended so that trade Unionists may sue in case of the non-payment of benefits contributed for,No Trade Union member  to be allowed to be put out of benefit for any reason other than his failure to pay the ordinary regular contribution,A limitation of the proportion of Trade Union income to be spent on working expenses.
THE POSITION OF&apos; WON--UNION LABOUR.Attention is also directed to the recommendation made by-several constituencies on the position of non-Union men - the view being held, in many constituencies that steps should be taken to secure to non-Unionists the opportunity to obtain employment without their employers being immediately subject to pressure from the Trade Union concerned.The various suggestions made on this question are summarised on page 4 of Appendix 4.
G 0 N G L U S I 0 M S.The general conclusion to be drawn from the returns Is that, while anything in the nature of repressive legislation would be vigorously resented and opposed by Trade Unionists at large (certainly in the North and Midlands by Conservative Trade Unionists as much as bv those who are not attached to any political party),  a sound reform of the Trade Union system, putting Trade Unions on a proper basis,   would be strongly supported.The General Strike, by throwing into relief the irregularities which are associated with Trade Union administra-tion to-day, has given, to the Conservative Party and opportunity which may never occur again to place the Trade Unions of this country once and for all upon a sound foundation.There is &apos;a broad line of division in the functions of any Trade Union - its provident side and Its industrial side. The administration of the provident and benefit side of Trade Unions should be as strict as that of any Friendly Society or other Trust Fund,  its officials being vested with the full responsibility of Trustees.      On its industrial side, a Trade Union should be at liberty to embark upon any activity it chooses, provided always that it is subject to the same law as the rest of the community,  and that its accounts in the interests of its members are subject to a proper audit.The abuses for which Conservative workingmen propose the remdies of the secret ballot, the restriction of picketing, and the regulation of the political levy, are,  after all, but symptoms of the anomalous position which Trade Unions at present hold, in the British Constitution.      They have grown up outside the law.      They started by being frankly illegal associations,   their illegality has only been partly corrected by successive statutes, and it is not generally realised that,
apart from the limited protection given by the Trade Union Act of 1871, most Trade . Unions to-day are still illegal associations at Common Law by reason of the fact that their rales are interpreted by the Courts as being in restraint of trade.     Even the Act of 1871 went out of   is way to enact that no contracts between a Trade Union and its members&apos;should be enforceable at law.      In consequence, except in so far as questions of actual fraud arise,  a Trade Unionist is entirely in the hands of his Executive;    if he thinks that his just rights are being withheld, no matter what the reason, he has no redress, except in the case of actual expulsion from his Union.     The anomaly left by the Act of 1871 in respect of the contractual duties of a Trade Union towards Its members was paralleled in the Trades Disputes Act,  1906, when the Trade Unions were relieved of responsibility for their ivrongful or tortious acts of any kind, whether committed against their own members or against the general public.      It is accurate to say that Trade Unions are to a very large extent not amenable to the ordinary courts of the land,  and that their members have no power to secure the enforcement of their rights.      In such circumstances, it is not surprising that in many cases scandals occur in Trade Union administration,  that proper accounts are not always kept, or if kept are not circulated to members, that moneys are not applied to the purpose for which they were contributed, that benefits are withheld on flimsy pretexts if the conduct of the claimant Is displeasing to his.Executive,  that where extremists have secured control of the Executive there are spent on propaganda for political purposes large sums which the contributors believed would build up substantial reserves In the benefit funds.      As long as the Trade Union Executives are a law unto themselves,  so long will abuses be inevitable.
It should he possible to present the case for reform in such a way as to hold out to Trade Unions that it is proposed to put them once and for all on a sound legal foundation,  to give their members the full protection of the law,  to secure to their members the right to. look after their own concerns according to their own rules, provided only that the elementary principles of justice are observed as between man and man, to secure individual members and their families against intimidation or terrorisation, and to permit to Trade Unions, as such, such scope for their political activities as they nay legislation tmately enj oy.A suggestion which might be deemed worthy of consideration is that,  if Trade Union legislation is to be promoted,  the possible criticism that the working classes were being attacked by special legislation would be avoided if it were made clear that such legislation would deal with Trade Unions in the same way as special legislation deals with Companies (which are employing organisations), friendly Societies, Approved Societies, and similar organisations dealing with insured people. If this logical line of dealing with Trade Unions in a somewhat similar manner to other organisations and combinations were adopted,  it should be comparatively sasy to draft a Bill laying down that Trade Unions or similar organisations should require registration at the Board of Trade, with approved Articles of Association setting out the scope of activity ((a) of an industrial character, and (b) of a Friendly Society or benefit character), with Rules or alterations to Rules similarly requiring approval, and with or without a six-monthly or annual list of members
with a provision for audit of accounts, and the production of an annual balance-sheet.      In the Articles of Association or Rules, any provisions as to the method of taking the ballot could be inserted;    members constituting the Union could be vested with all the advantages of a legal entityj the Trustees of the Benefit or friendly Society portion of the activity could be made legally responsible for their actions, as indeed could the whole management of the Union.Similarly,  the register of members, If divided into localities, could  be utilised in connection with any ballot required by the Articles of Association or Rules in connection with an industrial dispute.The above suggestion could be elaborated, but it probably sufficiently indicates the safeguards which could be introduced and. the effect of the comparison with Company Lav? and Friendly Society Lav; in meeting criticism that the working classes are being specially attacked.If the Party is prepared to take up the Trade Union question as a whole, from the point of view of doing justice to the members of Trade Unions themselves,  the thorny points of controversy that have been catchwords of industrial politics for the last twenty years would be more easily susceptible of solution than if they are thrown up as isolated issues which can be more easily distorted as oppressive and reactionary.If the Party does little or nothing, it will offend its friends without appeasing its enemies, who will attack it on the Trade Union issue in any event.      The Party will
S3stand, to lose as many votes if it introduced half-hearted and feeble proposals as if it-makes a genuine attempts to deal with the question once arid for all in a fair and impartial spirit - and, in the latter event, it is believed that the votes and support of thousands of Trade Unionists and other wage earners will be attracted who in normal conditions take no interest, whatever in politics,,(Signed)    I!.E0 BLAIN.Principal Agent.16th July,  192 6.-12-

On no account shouTG^ny portion of it be issxied for press publication.This Sub-Committee was- appointed in accordance with the following resolution&apos;of the 11922f Committee, moved by Sir Alfred Hopkinson, K.C., and seconded by Mr. A.R. Kennedy,  K.C.  :-&quot;The Conservative Private Members  (1922) Committee being of opinion that Trade Unions are an essential part of our industrial organisation,  and being anxious to support them, but considering that the difficulties of the whole subject require careful and. sympathetic investigation, appoints a Sub-Committee consisting of six Members, with power to add to their number,  to consider the subject and to make such suggestions,  if any, as it feels can safely be made within such time as may be available, the Members of the Sub-Committee to be selected, by the Executive&quot;.In accordance with the above resolution the following Members were selected by the Executive as a Sub-Committee :-Mr. Gervais Rentoul,  M.P. Mr. J.  Sandeman Allen,  M.P. Mr. W.  Greaves-Lord,  K.C.,M.P. Mr.  C.E.  Llovd,  M.P.   : Sir Leslie Scott,  K,C,M.:P. Mr. Luke Thompson,  M.P Captain II. Macmillan, K.P,We commenced our sittings on 10th June,  1926,  and since then have held 12 meetings.      From the start we were allfully impressed with the complexity of the subject and recog-nised that nearly every issue likely to be raised in connectionwith any amendment of existing Trade Union law and practice is necessarily interlocked,   to a very considerable extent,  with questions of broad, policy and expediency,  and that it was verydifficult to view the matter except as a whole.     We also feltthat it was most desirable to avoid even an appearance of attack upon Trade Unions as such,  or to antagonise Trade Union-ists and others who, whilst In general political sympathy withour views, nevertheless mi;:.ht be actuated In this matter by avery special feeling of loyalty to the supposed interests oflabour.      We realised,  moreover, that in relation to industrial disputes the objective should be to arrive at some method of conciliation acceptable to both parties and. that consequently the whole field should be fully explored in the hope of find-ing a solution in the way of a Conciliation Court, possibly insome cases arbitration,  or some other method of settling-1-DOCUMENT IS THE PHQJl^TY^ 0^ MAJESTY! S GOVERNMENT) .
disputes.     At the same time we recognise that the right to strike as a final arbitrament cannot be excluded except perhaps in services vital to the whole community.Owing, however, to the shortness of time available, the only way in which we could submit any concrete suggestions to the full.Committee before the House rises for the recess, would be by confining our investigations for the present, so far as possible&apos;, to five definite points, namely :-(1)  Peaceful Picketing.(2) Registration of trade -de Unions.(5) Trade Union Funds,(4)      (a) General Strikes.(b) Sympathetic Strikes.(c) Strikes in Essential Services.(d) Strikes In Breach of Contract. (5) Secret Ballot.In considering all these important questions,   we feel that whilst certain changes in&apos; the law^may be both necessary and desirable, it is at the same time essential to bear In mind that many of the difficulties that have arisen in recent years have been far more difficulties in administration of existing laws than defects in those laws themselves.      Moreover,  it is essen-tial to bear in mind that however excellent in theory a system may be, the benefit flowing from it will be negligible if it pre-sents overwhelming difficulties In its practical administration. Psychological and temperamental considerations also necessarily arise and Trade Unionists are often far more easily/ swayed by mass impulse and sentiment pla?ying upon a feeling of solidarity and loyalty to their Unions and fellow workers than by any amount of logic or economic argument.For these reasons, therefore...  we consider great care must be taken in any changes introduced, that nothing should be done to weaken Trade Unions as such or to lessen the authority of their leaders provided and in so far as they confine themselves to the legitimate functions of Trade Unionism.     In other words, whilst the interests of the community as a whole must be para-mount, we believe that the principle of collective bargaining is essential to the satisfactory conduct of industry to-day, and that any changes made should be so far as possible in the inter-ests of the workers themselves as well as the cornmunity as a whole.1, PEACEFUL PICKETING.The legal position in regard to this matter has been fully set out In the Home Office circular (Command Paper 2666) dated 30th December,  1925,  and we find, ourselves broadly in agreement with the view therein expressed.     We think that the main difficulty confronting the. police when dealing with trade disputes lies not so much in the insufficiency of the existing law as in its interpretation and enforcement.     Whilst this, no doubt, is generally true, we feel that certain of the evils connected with peaceful picketing,  and leading to a good deal of victimisation and intimidation of non-strikers, or of Trade Unionists who would otherwise be prepared to continue at work, might be avoided by an immediate amendment of section 2 of the Trade Dsiputes Act,  190S,  whereby (a) the number of pickets would be strictly limited,  thus striking,  it is hoped, to some extent at the present abuse known as mass picketing;    the wear-ing of badges by pickets should, in our opinion, be stipulated for,  and  (b) strict prohibition would be imposed on picketing
at or near the private residence of any man on strike, or, indeed anywhere but at the business premises involved.     Adequate penalties would necessarily be involved.      Violence, threats or intimidation of any kind directed, against the  wife or family of a worker should be made a serious crime.Whilst we do not suggest that these amendments, if carried out, would entirely obviate the michief complained of, and, indeed, there might well be practical difficulties in their enforcement from the point of view of the police, nevertheless we feel that they would undoubtedly be a move in the right directionsThese suggestions, we think, would probably commend themselves to most moderate Trade Unionists as well as to the general public, and would also indicate the anxiety of the Government to remedy a most unsatisfactory state of affairs.2* REGISTRATION OF TRADE UNIONS.At present registration of. Trade Unions is not only optional but when done is most perfunctory.     We are of opinion that all Trade Unions should be registered with the Registrar of Friendly Societies and that all legal privileges such as Immunity .should be confined to Trade Unions so registered.Their rules should also be registered and no alteration should be operative until siinilarly registered.As is the case in Friendly Societies certain re gala-tions should be laid down by the Registrar as necessary in the rules,  covering :.-(a) Fines and subscriptions.(b) Rules and meetings.(c) Appointment of trustees.(d) Control of branches as to returns, etc.(e) Arbitration re benefits,(f) Audit and right of investigation.(g) Right of a member- to receive report and balance sheet.For the information of members the rules should themselves contain a statement of the more important statutory rights of members,5* TRADE UNION FUNDS.While appreciating the difficulties involved we are of opinion that the benefit funds should be registered separately and be placed in the names of trustees being kept distinct from the general funds.      The benefit funds should only be used for the purpose for which they are subscribed.We would at the same time suggest that there ought to be no interference  with or transference of benefit funds to general funds without very definite safeguards, such as a vote of a clear majority of all the members.      In no circumstances should benefit funds, unless transferred to general funds, be liable for payment of damages that might be awarded at any time against a Trade Union as such.
4rGENERAL STRIKES.(a)    lie feel that a general strike rests necessarily on an entirely different footing from any other kind of trade dispute. As  the law now stands,  a general strike is of doubtful legality but, inasmuch as it involves an organised attack on the community, as we are of opinion that those responsible for organising, we well-as those taking part in it, are in a very different position from persons engaged in an ordinary trade dispute, and it should, we suggest, be laid down clearly that there will in the case of a general strike be no immunity whatever either for Trade Unions, their funds or their individual members, from any penalties, actions at lav?, or damages for which they would otherwise be liable under the ordinary Common Law, quite apart from any penal-ties which they may incur for conspirac?/-, etc.SYMPATHETIC STRIKES.(b)    We recognise that this is an extremely complicated question.     The chief difficult arises in defining what is exactly meant by a sympathetic strike,  or in drawing the line between a strike that commences by being sympathetic, but, as the struggle progresses,  ceases to be so     According to official figures published by the Ministry of Labour, an extremely small proportion of strikes can truly be classed as sympathetic throughout.     After careful consideration we feel that any legislation dealing with sympathetic strikes as such would be inadvisable.ESSENTIAL SERVICES.(c)    On the other hand,when considering this matter some differentiation might be made on grounds of public policy and restrictions might be imposed on all strikes, whether sympathetic or otherwise, in- services essential to the life of the nation. If such restrictions were to be put into force, then some sanc-tion would be needed for their enforcement and we suggest this might well be the loss of the present Immunity from legal action and from liability for torts.     The restrictions we suggest in regard to all such strikes, are that continued enjoyment of these exceptional privileges in the eye of the law should be made to depend on the use of definite conciliation machinery by employers and workmen,  analogous to that laid down, for instance, in the Lemieux Act in Canada and in certain Australian Statutes.As regards essential services as contemplated above we would suggest that rates and conditions as agreed by concil-lation or other recognised, machinery should be made implied minimum conditions of all civil contracts.      The difficulty as to the definition of essential services is dealt with later. (See p.6.)STRIKES IN BREACH OF COM TRACT.(d) While it is clear that the strikers in suoh. cases are liable in damages, the law at present does not appear to supply a sufficient check and might well be made more definite.
There should,  we think,  be no immunity for Trade Unions and their general funds in regard to liability for organising and taking pert in such strikes and any privilege allowed by law in connection with ordinary trade disputes should not apply to this class of strike.It will be apparent that these recommendations in (c) and (d)  above involve sn amendment of section 4 of the Trade Disputes Act,  19GS,  so as to make that section apply/ (except as to benefit funds) only to acts done in furtherance of a trade dispute,  and only then where such trade dispute does not involve a breach of contract.      In these two cases the definition of a trade dispute in the Act of 1906 should, we suggest, be amended in order that the privilege under that Act should not apply/ to any strike or lockout which is not preceded by preliminaries advocated elsewhere in this Memorandum,  or which we think should be declared illegal.5.  SECRET BALLOT.Both from, a political and an industrial point of view this question would seem to be one of especial difficulty. The uninformed public,  as well as many Conservative Trade Unionists,  are clamouring for a secret ballot to be compulsory in all Trade Unions before any strike can legally be carried out.      It is probable, however, that they do not appreciate the difficulties and complexities of putting an^ such scheme into operation.      It is true that a certain number of employ-ers of labour seom to share this desire,  but on the other hand a large number of leading employ/ers and others familiar with the inner Tforking of Trade Unions, have doubts as to the practicability of establishing a system which can be carried out satisfactorily by all parties affected,   and which,  at the same time.,  is likely to produce the result desired, namely, the real views of all workers in the industry or industries concerned.Even if the principle were adopted, many difficulties in setting up the necessary machinery would unquestionably arise.      If the control of the ballot were to be entirely taken out of the hands of the Trade Union officials and en-trusted to others appointed for the purpose,  this might give rise to a feeling In the minds of even Trade Unionists who were favourable to the adoption of the secret ballot, that it amounted to an aspersion on the good faith of the officials concerned,  and would in any case be viewed, as interfering with their domestic organisation.Difficulties would again arise with respect to the drafting of the question for the ballot,  and it would certainly be a costly matter,  as the Trade Unions would not willingly pay for it,  and the question would therefore arise as to whether it should be charged on the State  or on the industry affected. It would necessitate the compilation of a register of all work-era entitled to vote,  and this register would have  to be kept up-to-date,  which again would, prove a difficult and expensive matter, but assuming that these initial difficulties could be overcome,  there would still remain several serious questions to be met
(a) Would the Trade Unions as a whole accept such a radical alteration in their states and powers as this would involve?(b) Would there be any certainty that under such a system a really representative poll would take place, as a failure in this respect would be lamentable?(c) Is there any valid ground for thinking that the decision arrived at would materially differ from those at present reached through the haphazard and in some ways, unsatisfactory methods now employed?(d) In the case of Indus tidies in which a large proportion of workers are not members of Trade Unions, how far and in what way should their views be expressed?The possibility has also been pointed out that a ballot, even if properly conducted, might not materially alter the results at present obtained in most cases, and that judging by past experience the result of reference to the members of a Trade Union, in whatever form It is made,  almost alwa:/s corresponds with the wishes and views of the Trade Union leaders.Taking the foregoing considerations Into account,  and also evidence that has come before us as a Sub-Committee and as individuals, we have come to the definite conclusion    that a-Tuni-form rule for a secret ballpt, whether confined to the Trade Unions or applicable tb all workers throughout an industry, would be undesirable^ and would,  on the whole, probably do more harm than good.     We believe that in this direction more satis-factory results can be obtained by extending the employment of definite conciliation machinery than by the application of a secret ballot,-But as regards essential services, for which we have already suggested some  form of compulsory conciliation as a preliminary but not an absolute barrier to a strike or lockout, we think that the institution of machinery for the holding of a secret ballot in this cage after the issues have been defined by the Conciliation Court might be considered.     -We fully appreciate that there may be some difficulty in defining exactly what is meant by the term &quot;essential services&quot;.     The present- limitation of these to gas, water and electricity is too narrow.      Sanitary services and transport ought, in our view,.to be added,  and consideration should be given to the question of including other industries in this category.x     x     x     x       x     x     x     x     x
we desire to emphasise that wherever any limitation is placed upon the rights of workers and of workers&apos;&apos;Trade Unions similar limitations should, where capable of application, be placed on employers and their organisations and appropriate sanctions should be considered.There are many other matters into which we desire to go more fully at a later stage, such as the political levy, the position of servants of the State with regard to Trade Unions, the extension of conciliation machinery, and analogous questions. From a political point of view we consider it of importance that if the Government contemplates legislative action on these lines, such action should be taken without delay, both to remedy some of the more glaring abuses revealed In the General strike and in recent industrial disputes, and to satisfy public opinion.     At the same time we are profoundly impressed with the importance of reducing the number of strikes and lockouts by the method of removing the cause rather than by suppressing the occasions of industrial unrest,&apos; 4We are of opinion that a Royal Commission or other body with similar powers ouglit^ to &quot;oe&quot; appofiv^gd wfih wXcfe terms&quot; 6T reference to collect ^information, as to&quot;&quot;the whole Industrial policy of Trade Unions in this country during the past 20 7/ears, and to consider the development and present condition of Trade Unions from an economic and social point of view.We have not overlooked the fact that some of this ground has been covered by the Committee on Industry and Trade in their &quot;Survey of Industrial Relations&quot; recently issued.     This Committee was appointed by the Labour Government and the terms of reference are very full and so far the whole Committee have been unanimous in their conclusions *      It is, moreover, by the fact of Its appointment and its membership, likely that It will be more acceptable to the Labour Part?/ than any Commission appointed by the present Government,      Possibly this Committee, which so far have not made  their recommendations on this subject, would be the suitable body to deal with the whole question.      If necessary, additional powers with regard to obtaining evidence could be conferred upon it, and if the information so obtained could be presented in a form that would ensure wide pTibl&amp;city, we believe it would greatly facilitate the formation of a sound public opinion.Such a body would be in a position to investigate thoroughly the effect of the separation of different trades in a particular industry, not only upon output, but upon industrial costs,  and generally whether the restriction upon the work permitted to each worker as prescribed by his Trade Union regula-tions has had a beneficial or prejudicial effect upon the position, skill, and efficiency of the workers, and upon the cost of production in each industry, also&apos;to what extent Craft Unions as distinguished from Industrial Unions, have been developed both in this country and in foreign countries, and how they have compared in their effects, both upon the success of the industry and upon the position of the workers,  together with the general influence of Trade Union legislation, both before and since 1906, on the workers and on the industry.x     x     x     x       x       x -7-
In conclusion/ we would again emphasise that,  owing to the short time available, this report is entirely preliminary and merely endeavours to indicate lines of action, rather than to lay down any definite policy.( J. SANDSMAW ALLEN.( 11 o GREAVES-LORD       x( CYRIL LLOYD.Signed.      ( HAROLD MAGMILLAN.( GERVAIS RSNTOULc      (Chairman)( LESLIE SCOTT.( LUKE THOMPSON.k Except as to that part dealing with the secret ballot on which I append a separate memorandum indicating the points on which I differ from the other members of the Committee.
MEMORANDUM ON SECRET BALLOT,A decree of an Executive or any body other than the general members declaring a. strike may mean, and often does mean, that Trade Unionists are forced unwillingly into strike action by reason of the penalties which may be inflicted under Trade Union Rules for non-compliance with such an order.     This power, which was exercised during the General Strike, is even more tyrannical than some of the methods of picketing.It is, therefore, in my opinion, essential that before a strike of any magnitude takes place provision should be made for a real expression of opinion by those who will, if the strike is declared, come under strike orders.     For this purpose a ballot of the workmen is the form of consultation most in accordance with British ideas, and also with Trade Union theory and practiceoIt is certain, however, except in one of two instances, the idea prevails among Trade Unionists * that such ballots as are now taken are not secret, and so long as ballots are conducted in the method at present adopted by Trade Unions, this.view will be held, and ballots cannot be relied upon to obtain a true expression of opinion^,      It is obvious that a ballot conducted otherwise than within a Trade Union must result in some expense, and unless provision is made for limiting the occasions on which a ballot is taken a system of ballot.might be irksome and irritating and, in consequence, ineffective to produce the result desired.I    would suggest,  therefore,  that the occasions for use of a secret ballot regarding strikes should be those in which the proposed strike&quot;would&quot;tend to affect injuriously the general well-buing of the community, and that the necessity for a ballot should not be imposed where the strike, if declared, would not extend beyond very narrow limits.      With this is view,  I would propose that provision should be made for taking a ballot when a strike is proposed:-(a)    In undertakings relating to the provision of lighting, water, fuel, or sanitarjr services.(b)    In key industries where a strike means bringing many other industries to a standstill or into grave difficulties.(c)    In all cases where the proposed strike would extend to the whole or a substantial part of an industry, or where, owing to the nature of the trade or trades affected, serious injury is likely to be caused to the community.The ballot, in my opinion, might be conducted by the Registrar of Friendly Societies, and might be carried out through the post.For this purpose a register should be kept by the Registrar of all Trade Unionists.      In addition, provision should be made for the voluntary registration of non-Unionists,      In the case of the Trade Unionist, the Trade Union officials should be responsible for making returns, which should be made periodically,
In the case of non-Unionists, a register might be kept at all works employing over 100 hands, and provision made for transmission periodically of a copy of such listcWhere a strike was threatened,  the ballot should be all Trade Unionists and all registered non-^Jnionists who would cease work as a direct result of the declaration of such strike.The framing of the question for submission is a matter of considerable difficulty, and. I would prefer that provision should be made in all cases for the ballot being preceded, by an inquiry by an Industrial Court or the use of conciliation machinery, and in such case,  the question for the ballot should be framed by the Court, or the independent chairman of the Conciliation Board, as the case may be0The method of enforcement I suggest would be to declare any such strike illegal, and for that reason outside the definition of &quot;trade dispute&quot; in the Act of 190 6, unless its declaration were preceded by a ballot and such other preliminary inquiry as is indicated above,(Signed)    W. GREAVES-LORD.
