l&amp;MTS INlOTJS of-pQTgTION OF5,      In addition to the advantages from the legal point of view set out in Paper (3) the following are the principal ar.oimonts in favour of the proposed conditional acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Permanent Court which have been submitted to the Committee -In recent years the tendency of foreign countries to favour the principle of compulsory arbitration has Increased;    Great Britain has supported the application of the principle In the case of disputes between other countries and her refusal to adopt the procedure generally may give rise to unfavourable comment and to misrepresentation of her motives.If Great Britain accepted the principle,, her example would have very great influence throughout the world andespecially with the smaller turbulent foreign powers whose disputes have in the past often led to great wars.(b(c)The preservation of peace is the continued maintenance of vital to civilizationand any measure which will help to convert public opinion from the use of force to recourse to conciliation and arbitration must be of value.&apos;d)The Permanent Court is in establishing a reputation and freedom from politioa and it should be the aim to assist in strengthenin and to enlarge the functi World wide recognition of impartiality will result of equitable and impartia so create an atmosphere f universal acceptance of c arbitration.process of for impartiality 1 influences, of Great Britain g that reputation ons of the Court.the Court1s from a long series 1 decisions, and avourable to the ompulsorye) The alternative to arbitration by tho Permanent Court is an enquiry by the Council of the League.    The Council regards itself as a political body and determines questions submitted to it mainly on political grounds and with spec ial regard to
political considerations.    It is wholly unfitted in any case to decide questions of a &quot;justiciable&quot; nature.    Great Britain has little or nothing to fear from the decisions of a judicial and impartial tribxmal but has good reason to apprehend the conclusions, based on political considerations of expediency, of a political body;,    It is therefore in her interest to endeavour to secure the transference of as many categories of disputes from the purview of the Council to that of the Court.IfUMElPS 60      The case against acceptance at the present time&apos;&quot;THEof &quot;tiie compulsory jurisdiction of the Permanent Court- may be summarised as follows:-(a)  In view of the fact  that the constitution in this connection it may be noted that the Dominions are acutely divided on the question of acceptance.    The views of the Government of India are set out in paragraph 2 above.   Australia and New Zealand are opposed to acceptance of the principle;    the late Canadian Government was prepared to accept with reservation;    the Irish Free State favoured acceptance;    the attitude of the Union of South Africa is non-committal.Of the British Empire is not unitary,  it may prove to be extremely dangerous for Great Britain to enter into obligations which she cannot subsequently fulfil. This objection was discussed in Lord Haldane&apos;s Memorandum of July 21st 1924, Paper (A) of C.P*257(26) when he reached the conclusion that it would be safer in the present state of the constitution of the Empire to avoid trying to go further than Article 13 of the Covenant of the League of Nations..(b)  Connected with the foregoing objection is the difficulty discussed in the concluding paragraphs of the late Sir Ec Crowe&apos;s Memorandum, Paper (C)  of CP.257(26),    The proposed undertaking involves the waiver of the reservation as to those disputes which touch the vital interests, independence or honour of the State,    It is very doubtful whether public opinion at home or overseas would tolerate acceptance of an unfavourable award on a question of primary importance such (for instance)  as the protection of the interests of   this country in Egypt,    No Government could undertake that Parliament would enact the legislation necessary to give effect to an award prejudicial to the honour, independence or vital interests of the country.
(c) Acceptance of the  jurisdiction may lead to claims on the part of certain Dominions to bring inter-Imperial issues before:   the Court.    The  Irish Free State might,  for example, demand arbitration on the question of Irish appeals to the Privy Council.      A dangerous situation would arise if Great Britain and the Dominions became compelled to submit their differences to the Court.(d ) While an undertaking by  Great Britain would always be loyally carried out to the fullest practicable extent,  there is no security that some foreign countries would not attempt&apos; to evade their obligations in esses where it suited them to do so. It may be true that the existence of the Covenant and the League of Nations tends to make repudiation or avoidance of obligations more difficult, but nevertheless Great Britain must always be to some extent handicapped in this particular respect.(e ) Whatever other foreign  rn countries may decide to do there is no prospect that either the United States or Soviet Russia, will accept the principle, of compulsory arbitration.(f) The admitted weakness of the Council of the League is not a sufficient re&amp; son for  the submitting in all esses  to the  jurisdiction of the Permanent Court.In 1920 the Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers declared against acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction on several grounds,  one of which was the grave doubt &apos;&apos;whether it would be politic for Great Britain to bind herself in any circumstances to refer any disputes which might arise in the future within the  very wide   jurisdiction to a  tribunal of whose impartiality it has no assurance&quot;.    This conclusion was subsequently adopted by the Cabinet on 3rd November, 1920.    (Cabinet 59(20) Conclusion 7, Appendix (V)(4)).There is,  of course, nothing to prevent Great Britain from agreeing to submit any particular question to the Court for decision.(g) v-hiie it may be desirable on. general grounds to set up a special Tribunal for the arbitration of individual pecuniary claims,  there is some danger that such a tribunal might admit  the    validity of claims by foreign nationals against the British Government in cases where the British Courts had rejected similar claims by British subjects.
ICE,90e3 *57, After careful consideration the Committee, with theexception of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, have reached tne conclusion that the objections to acceptance of the principle of compulsory arbitration in international disputes outweight any advantages which might result from acceptance of the principle.      Tuey are accordingly unable to recommend the cabinet to reverse the decision taken by their predecessors on this question in 1920, IUM     8, If the Cabinet ad opt the view of the Committee, it maybe necessary to explain and  justify to the Imperial Conference the reasons for the decision so reached.    At their request the Attorney General has prepar d,  in consultation with the officials of the Foreign Office and Dominions Office, a Llamorandum for circulation,  if the Cabinet approve, to the Imperial Conference.      A copy of this Memorandum is attached hereto  (Appendix      ).      If this Memorandum is accepted by the Imperial Conference it could form the basis of statements to be made in the various Imperial Parliaments, explaining the reasons for the non acceptance by the British Empire of the principle of compulsory arbitration in all international dispute lUSIOIvTS.  9, The Committee submit the following Conclusions to theCabinet -(l) That the proposal that Great Britain should accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the Permanent Court of International Justice,  either generally or to the limited extent suggested in Paper  (B) of CP.   257(26) is not one which they con recommend the Cabinet to entertain.
(2) That the British Representatives at the Imperial Conference should be authorised to circulate to the Conference, if and when they think fit,  copies of the Memorandum (Appendix E ) explaining the objections of the British Government to acceptance of the principle of compulsory arbitration in all International&apos; disputes.requested that his dissent from the above recommendations should be recorded.10.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster hasR.

this  Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. ]     435Printed for the Imperial Conference, 1926.Copy No.    30Appendix.IMPERIAL CONFERENCE, 1926.COMPULSORY ARBITRATION IN INTERNATIONAL DISPUTES.Memorandum prepared for the Imperial Conference.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government have had occasion to consider on more than one occasion the possibility of acceptance of the principle of arbitration in all inter-national disputes, either by signifying their acceptance of the clause in the statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice providing for the compulsory submission of certain classes of cases to the Court, or by the conclusion of treaties with individual foreign countries providing for the submission of all disputes without exception to arbitration.The matter is one upon which it seems essential that there should be uniformity of action on the part of all the Governments of the Empire, and His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore desire to bring the question before the Imperial Conference.Under Article 13 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, the members of the League have agreed that whenever any dispute shall arise between them which they recognise to be suitable for submission to arbitration or judicial settlement, and which cannot be satisfactorily settled by diplomacy, they will submit the whole matter to arbitration or judicial settlement, and the Article goes on to recognise that disputes relating to the interpretation of a treaty, any question of international law, the existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute a breach of an inter-national obligation, or the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for the lireach of an international obligation are &quot; generally suitable for submission to arbitration.&quot; The question involved, therefore, is whether it is desirable to go further and to agree in advance to submit to arbitration every dispute of this nature which may arise, even though questions of vital interest, independence or honour may be concerned.When the constitution of the Permanent Court of International Justice was under consideration in 1920, the draft scheme then prepared contained articles providing for compulsory arbitration in the cases now under discussion. The question was referred to the highest legal authorities in Great Britain, and a considered and unanimous opinion was pronounced in October 1920, signed by the then Lord Chancellor, the Attorney-General and Solicitor-General (Lord Birkenhead, Sir Gordon (now Lord) Hewart, and Sir Ernest Pollock (now Lord Hanworth)), advising against the acceptance of the articles. In view of this opinion His Majesty&apos;s (government felt unable to accept the articles as originally drafted, and their I *rovisions were ultimately so modified by the League as to assume the form in which they now stand in Article36 of the Statute, that is, leaving it optional for any State to accept the obligation of compulsory arbitration under the heads mentioned.The question of accepting the compulsory arbitration of the Court was again considered in the summer of 1924, when memoranda were prepared by the then Lord Chancellor (Lord Haldane) and the then Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs advising against this course. At the wish of the Prime Minister (Mr. Ramsay MacDonald) copies of these memoranda were communicated to the Dominion G governments, whose views on the whole question were invited, immediately afterwards the question arose in a practical form as a result of the discussions at Geneva, leading to the framing of the Protocol for the Pacific Settle-ment of International Disputes, under which the signatories would have accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court in the cases referred to in Article 36 of its Statute with the right to make reservations compatible with that Article.[15197]SECRET. E. 114.
Either in reply to the despatch mentioned in the preceding paragraph or in the course of the discussions on the Protocol, varying expressions of opinion were made by the Governments of the Dominions and India. These are summarised in the Annex. It will be seen that, while the Governments of Canada and the Irish Free State were inclined to favour acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Permanent Court in justiciable disputes, the Governments of the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand and India were opposed to such acceptance, while the Government of the Union of South Africa did not express any definite opinion.The main advantages claimed for acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court are two : 1. If the principle were accepted by the Governments of the Empire, their example would have a very great influence throughout the world, and especially with the smaller turbulent foreign Powers, whose disputes have in the past often led to great wars. The preservation of peace is vital to the continued maintenance of civilisation, and any measure which will help to convert public opinion to substitute conciliation and arbitra-tion for the use of force, must, it is argued, be of immense value.2. If the jurisdiction of the Permanent Court in all the cases mentioned were accepted without exception, any foreign country, which also had accepted the principle, would be bound to submit to arbitration any particular dispute with any part of the Empire, if the Government of that part of the Empire desired this course to be taken.On the other hand, the following considerations have been urged against acceptance : (a.) The advantages claimed above are to a great extent illusory. While an undertaking by any part of the Empire will always be loyally carried out to the fullest practicable extent, there is no security that foreign countries will not attempt to evade their obligations in cases where it suits them to do so. In any case, whatever other foreign countries may decide to do, there is no prospect that either the United States of America or Soviet Russia will accept the principle of compulsory arbitration.(b.) It seems impossible for any democratic country to bind itself in advance to accept compulsory arbitration in every case falling under the specific categories referred to in Article 36 of the Statute, because it might well be that any particular dispute falling within those categories was such that effect would have to be given to an adverse award by legislation, and it is impossible to guarantee in advance that the Parliament of the country concerned would be prepared to pass the legislation required in every case. On the other hand, if the jurisdiction is optional, it is always possible to submit the matter to Parliament in advance in any case where Parliamentary action might be necessary-.(c.) The proposed undertaking would involve the complete waiver of the right to reserve from submission to arbitration disputes touching the vital interests, independence or honour of the State. Such a waiver might, however, have most serious consequences, since it is very doubtful whether public opinion in any part of the Empire would tolerate the acceptance of an unfavourable award on a question of primary importance to that part, e.g., one affecting the position of Great Britain in relation to Egypt, or the validity of restrictions on the immigration of nationals of foreign countries into the Dominions.(d.) From the purely legal standpoint, the Permanent Court is not a satisfactory body for the task of adjudicating on disputes of primary importance, since it has decided not to be bound by any rules of evidence, and the absence of any such rules makes it very dangerous to give an undertaking in advance to accept decisions of the Court on any questions which may arise.(e.) The election of judges to the Court gives ample scope for political influence, and the danger of the exercise of such influence would be considerably accentuated if it were known that some particular pending dispute between two countries must inevitably be referred to the Court for arbitration.In the circumstances, it is the feeling of His Majesty&apos;s Government that, at the present moment, it would be premature to accept the compulsory arbitration of the
Permanent Court in the cases contemplated in Article 36 of its Statute, and that it would be preferable, as suggested by the Government of India (see Annex), to wait until there have been a few more years&apos; experience of the working of the Permanent Court, and it is seen whether it has been possible to build up a form of procedure which would render it safe to accept its jurisdiction in all cases falling within the categories mentioned.Annex.Note on Recent Views expressed by Dominion Governments in regard to compulsory Arbitration.IN September 1924 the notice of the Dominion Governments was called to the provision contained in Article 36 of the statute establishing the Permanent Court of International Justice, under which, either at the time of signature or ratification of the protocol to which the statute is adjoined, or at a later moment, a declaration may be made that the parties recognise as compulsory ivso facto, and without special agreement, in relation to any other member of the League of Nations or State, accepting the same obligation, the jurisdiction of the Court in certain specified classes of legal disputes.It was stated that no such declaration had been made on behalf of His Majesty s Government either on the 16th December, 1920, when the protocol was signed by Lord Balfour, or subsequently, and that no declaration had been made on behalf of any of the dominion members of the League, or of India. It was further stated that representations had recently been made to His Majesty&apos;s Government from parliamentary and other quarters that the time had arrived when the matter should be reconsidered; the issues raised were, however, of great importance and complexity, particularly in relation to the position of the British Empire in time of war, when acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court would enable any foreign country, if it were similarly bound, to contest before the Court the legality of naval measures.The only speeific replies to this despatch were those received from New Zealand and the Union of South Africa.New Zealand. . , iThe New Zealand Government, in November 1924, stated that they strongly-objected to any proposal that Great Britain should make such a declaration, particularly on the ground that upon a number of matters of international law, especially those relating to belligerent rights at sea, the view taken by continental jurists (who would, of course, form a majority on the Permanent Court) was opposed to the principles long established in England and essential to the interests of Great Britain.Union of South Africa.The Government of the Union of South Africa stated in October 1924 that the matter was receiving their careful consideration, and that they had come to the conclusion that it was not necessary at that stage, at all events, for them to offer any observations on the question.The subject of compulsory arbitration was, however, referred to on several occasions in the course of correspondence regarding the Protocol for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes, and the following expressions of opinion may be cited :  Canada.In a message from the Prime Minister of Canada of the 4th March, 1925, it was stated that, &quot; as Canada believes firmly in submission of international disputes to joint enquiry or arbitration, and has shared in certain number of undertakings in this field, we would be prepared to consider acceptance of compulsory jurisdiction o! Permanent Court in justiciable disputes with certain reservations and co-operation in further consideration of method of supplementing the provisions of the Covenant for settlement of non-justiciable issues.&quot;Commonwealth of Australia.A message from the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, dated the 5th March, 1925, stated at length the views of the Commonwealth Government on the provisions
of the Geneva Protocol relating to compulsory arbitration. &apos; These views mav be summarised as follows :  &apos; &quot;&quot;(a.) The provisions of the Covenant dealing with the settlement of disputes which furnish an alternative procedure (viz., enquiry by the Council of League of Nations) appear to have advantage in elasticity..;and adapta-tion to the existing state of public opinion over the proposed ;machinerv of compulsory arbitration.(b.) The absence from the League of certain of the foremost nations of the world renders premature any endeavour at the present time to generalise the principle of compulsory arbitration.New Zealand. --In a memorandum, dated the 6th January, 1925, signed by the then Prime Minister of New Zealand (Mr. Massey) the objections to the admission of the Permanent Court as a deciding factor &quot;in determining Great britain&apos;s belligerent rights at sea, to which reference is made above, were developed at length. The fear was also expressed that the Permanent Court might interfere with the New Zealand immigration laws should the principle of compulsory arbitration be adopted.Irish Free State.A statement on the Geneva Protocol was made in the Dail by the Minister of External Affairs of the Irish Tree State on the 13th May, 1925, which contained the following passage: &quot;An extension of the principle of arbitration, which serves to define and enunciate international judgment, and which relies in the last resort on the moral pressure of world opinion, and not upon the application of material sanctions, appears to us to be the most effective feasible means of attaining, at least in a large measure, the objects which the protocol has in view.&quot;Later, in the course of the same debate, in reply to a question as to the Permanent Court of International Justice, the Minister stated :-&quot; There is also what is known as the optional clause-.&apos;No. 36. We arc considering adherence to that clause. There is one matter which had delayed our action in that, and that is, we are not quite sure whether we can already be regarded as being bound by the statute, which was ratified bv Great Britain before our coming into separate existence, and before our membership of the League. It is a question of whether or not we have to ratify it on behalf of this country. When that question is cleared up, so far as I have gone into the matter, I would be entirely in favour of adopting that optional clause.&quot;It may be noted that in July 1925 the New Zealand Government again referred to the danger of submitting questions regarding belligerent -rights at sea to the Permanent Court in connection with the renewal of the Arbitration Convention with the Netherlands. It was, however, found possible to reassure the New Zealand Government that such questions could be excluded from the application of the Convention under article 1, as matters affecting the vital interests of either party, and the New Zealand Government did not press for any special action to be taken to make this clear at the time of the renewal of the convention.In September 1924 the Government of India said : that while desirous not to place obstacles in the way of provision of further procedure which would permit of the adjustment of differences between States and thus perhaps avoid future war, they were impressed by the need for caution and would prefer to wait till they had had several years&apos; experience of the working of the Permanent Court of International Justice before deciding to accept clause 36 of the Statutes of the Court, as proposed in the Protocol for Pacific Settlement, either conditionally or otherwise. In any case, they could not agree to acts of the past being submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court. Moreover, they thought they would also have to exclude from its purview cases in which the vital interests, independence or honour of India were concerned. They also drew attention to certain specific difficulties with regard to China, which would be involved by the acceptance of Article 36 of the statute by the Government of India.
