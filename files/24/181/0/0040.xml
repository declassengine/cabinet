Hon. Stanley Baldwin, M.P., 10, Downing Street, Whitehall,  S.W.I.SirCOAL STOPPAGE,The -Coaf edercrtion recognises the difficult task with which the Government has been confronted in the present Coal Stoppage end the anxiety which the Government and all sections of the Community have shared towards securing ly settle-ment of it-.The Confederation fsels that in such a situation as the present - the stoppage has now lasted fully 21 weeks with losses of great magnitude to the Industry and general welfare of the y/hole country - it is appropriate that the Government should at this stage be advised as to the attitude of Employers generally on certain aspects of the situation.The Confederation, as representing Employers in indus-tries employing 7 million workpeople,, would therefore desire to Inform you that in its opinion an effective and lasting settlement based on roalitios and whioh will afford some measure of industrial stability,  is so essential to British Industry that it transcends all other immediate considerations Ho section of the Community would welcome an immediate t ermine. -tion of this stoppage more than those who have meanwhile to carry on the productive business of the country under the inevitable handicaps of a prolonged coal stoppage.    A. real and effective settlement&apos; in these coal issues is however of such paramount importance to the future of this country,  that
Employers are prepared to  continue to fact, the existing heavy losses which the stoppage entails rather than see sny settlement based on unrealities and which would expose this country to the continued repetition of these national disasters with their groat hardships and sacrifices to all sections of the CommuhityoThe Confederation would further venture to suggest as a natter for the most serious consideration of  the Government, whether the time has not now come when it has to be recognised that the only means of securing an effective settlement in the Goal Mining Industry - just as in all othor industries -lies in those engaged in the Industry, Employers and Workers alike, being brought to realise that such a settlement must be worked out between themselves *    Tho Confoderation believes that it is only in this way that there can come that goodwill and co-operation v/hioh is so essential to industry^The Confederation is assured that the Coal Mining Industry provides in each of its geographical areas machinery on both sides fully qualified to adjust wages and working conditions appropriate to  these areas and conciliation machinery in these areas for the settlement of disputes, and the Confederation end find no reason why the Government should be called upon to intervene or why a dispute in the Coal Mining Industry should automatically be transferred from the industrial field to the political arena.The Confederation is convinced that no real progress will be made towards the real and effective settlement which the country has a right to expect,  so long as those engaged in the industry can continue to look to the Govern-ment for intervention and for the finding of ways and means of effeoting a settlement0In support of these views the Conf aderation would respectfully desire to point out that the history of national Coal Stoppages shows conclusively that they have in their origin and duration been in large measure condi-tioned by the assured prospect of Government intervention -which has in some cases taken the form of financial assistance- and that the resultant settlements thereby brought about, without reference to the realities of the situation have themselves contained the germ of the succeeding stoppage^.In these circumstances the Confederation ventures to suggest that tho Government may see its way to decide and make known that in future the Coal Mining Industry must, like other industries,  face its own difficulties and  work, out its own solutions-    Granted these conditions the Con-federation foels sure that a great sten will have been taken towards ensuring the welfare of the Kation and of the Coal Mining Industry itself and it is with these convictions formed from its practical experience of industrial affairs that the Confederation ventures to submit its views to the Government in the present crisis.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,.
