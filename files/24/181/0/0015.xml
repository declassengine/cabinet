IRON AND STEEL.MR. DORMAN wrote:    &quot;The 23 blast furnaces in operation at the end of May were reduced to 11 at the end of June.    The production of pig iron in June amounted to 41,800 tons compared with 88,800 tons in May, 539,100 tons in April, and 510,300 tons in June 1925.    The production of steel ingots and castings was further reduced to 32,800 tons in June as compared with 4-5,700 tons in Hay,  361,000 tons in April,  and 585,400 tons in June, 192 5.&quot;There is really no change in the position of the Heavy Steel Trade from last month, owing to the continuance of the Goal Stoppage.    As will be seen fr*om the production figures given,  there is a continued easing off of operations due to lack of supplies of coal,  etc.&quot;In the Wire Trade a number of fjrms are still working part time, and there is no general alteration in conditions as compared with last month.    Black and Galvanised Sheet Works,  although still operating on much reduced outputs, find it increasingly difficult to carry on, owing to the great shortage of all classes of material which they require. There are good bookings, however,  and this branch of the industry is in a firm condition.    Constructional Engineering Works are still operating, although, there has been some slackening off lately of both orders and enquiries.&quot;The absence of a settlement of the coal dispute causes the most serious apprehension to all Iron and Steel Makers, as the industry is almost entirely closed down.    At the same time,  it is generally felt throughout the trade that the economic facts of the position must be faced,  and that the Mining Industry,  in common with all others, must effect such a settlement as will enable it-.to meet world competition without artificial assistance.    Any increase in the cost of coal must seriously effect the Iron and Steel Industry when it is realised that on an average 3-g- tons of coal per ton of steel is consumed,   and for some products this amount is even higher. Contracts for pig iron are frequently lost by a few pence per ton,  and for finished steel by l/- to 2/- per ton.    It can therefore be readily seen that any increase in the cost of coal must have a serious reaction on the Iron and Steel Industry, and make its present competitive position still weaker.&quot;MR. BAKER wrote:    &quot;The North of England Smelters Sliding Scale shows l^fo reduction,  and this stands now at 21^ above the Standard.    This leaves wages for about 30,000 iron and steel workers, who are governed by this scale, about        higher than, they were on July 30th, 1914, whereas you know the cost of living&apos; is 70f0 up.&quot;On the other hand the North of England Iron scale shows an addition of 25%;  this is largely owing to an accident of clroumstances.    One firm whose books are audited for the purpose of getting out the average price, happens to be working a very high grade of malleable iron,  and as other firms have not been working,  there is little or no lower grade and lower priced materials to balance and get a more normal average.    Therefore, this increase is not indicative of an improvement in trade.&quot;
STEEL.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR reported that in Sheffield a considerable amount of steel of the highest qualities, and of tools, was being turned out,  due to the facts that they had a good deal of electric power available there, that a great deal of foreign coal was coming in, and that they were getting a very large quantity of outcrop coal. Orders were ooming In fairly well, but some were being lost on account of difficulties of delivery.    The trouble was particularly in the re-rolling side of the trade; they were delayed in getting the billets from the big steel works. General trade was still ooming in satisfactorily.    The recent Spanish Decree was a serious thing for Sheffield..    On the I-ith July in London the King of Spain signed this Decree, to come into operation three days later, which completely killed the bulk of the Sheffield trade.    Nobody in Spain was allowed to stock steel of outside make.    Consumers were still allowed to buy steel, but the conditions were very difficult; they had to get three kinds of certificates before they could import steel at all, and no Spanish manufacturer, except with a trained staff, could get them all successfully.    So far, whatever representa-tions had been made from our side had been totally ineffective. The Sheffield market In Europe had, In fact, been worn away. There wag nothing of it left in France and Belgium, and very little in Italy and Switzerland.    The only portion of the European market remaining had been in Spain.N0N-F3RROUS METALS.SIR CECIL BUDD wrote: &quot;Trade in the non-ferrous metals remains very quiet and ha3 undergone practically no change since I last reported.    Such indications as there are, however, are, I think,  in the direotion of expansion, and I think that increased activity may be very confidently expected when the coal sr,cppageis brought to an end&quot; .SHIPBUILDING AND MOTOR TRADES *SIR JOHN THORNYCROFT wrote: &quot;Shipbuilders who have been unable to obtain their material owing to the Coal Stoppage have,  in some oases, obtained supplies from the Continent. For some time Engine Builders have been obtaining their large forgings from the Continent so as to get the advantage of lower prices and, therefore, trhe stoppage has not affected them in this respect.      In the cane of my own firm an order was received for three large Refrigerator Lighters for the South African Government and, as early delivery was necessary, we placed the order for the material
SHIPBUILDING AND MOTOR TRADES  (contd..).through a Dutch firm for German plates.    The quality seems good and deliveries have been very satisfactory.    It is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain forgings and steel castings in this country.&quot;in the invitations to tender for the Argentine Cruisers and Flotilla Leaders importance is laid on fairly early delivery.    In the event of the orders being placed in this country during the next month it will be very difficult to give the deliveries required unless the Coal btoppage is settled almost at once,&apos; assuming British material is used.     The Argentine Commission are obtaining offers from Continental firms and there is no doubt that the Stoppage is influencing them unfavourably against this country.&quot;After discussing the Stoppage with workmen in my firm&apos;s different establishments, I am of opinion that a large portion of them would be glad to see the Government rescind the Trades Disputes Act which, in their opinion, enables the extremists to dominate the Unions, and it is only the extremists at the present time who are preventing the Miners returning to work,and that   if picketing were made illegal the Coal Stoppage would come to an end every quickly.    After the General Strike workmen assumed that the Government would act.    The delay in doing so has strengthened the position of the extremists, and now the feeling is that the minority movement has a much stronger hold on the Unions than before the General Strike.*As regards the Vehicle Industry, the oar as distinct from the commercial vehicle has, to a great extent, a seasonal sale and sales usually slack off at the end of July, and during August; so it is difficult to judge the extent to which the Stoppage is affecting the Industry. Motor Vehicle firms always have to order supplies much further ahead than ordinary engineering firms, and, for this reason, the industry has, so far, not been so seriously affected as General Engineering.    The makers of forgings, etc are carrying on to some extent yrith the use of foreign coal and are installing oil furnaces, but are advising their customers&apos; that making their forgings in this way will put up the price lofo or 20? .COTTON*COLONEL SSDDON BROWN stated that the cotton trade in Lancashire was in a very disorganised condition at the present moment, and was extremely bad.Taking the American spinning section first, some mills were closed, and a yery great deal of short time was being worked.    There was no profit now in spinning American ootton with ooal at a normal price; it was therefore evident that a great deal of short time and unemployment must take place with imported coal at present prices, &apos;The latest figures available in this section of the trade showed that orders were just slightly in excess of actual production, but these orders
COTTON (Oontd.).were only equal to 50fa of a normal 48 hours week working. In the Egyptian section, trade was not quite as good as it had been.   About 1^ million spindles were stopped, and about 600,000 spindles were on short time, which was equivalent to about 22t0o of spindles either stopped or doing very short time, practically all owing to the coal situation.As regards business, in the American section of the trade it would probably be fair to say that the whole section was running at a loss.    In the Egyptian section of the trade those mills that had not to pay too much for coal were perhaps just about meeting expenses.    There was some enquiry in the market, but further difficulties had arisen owing to the fact that Indian and other buyers were now refusing to concede the strike clause, which made business almost impossible to negotiate. China was still enquiring, but no weight of business was going through.    The Continent was still very bad; the difficulty we had had in collecting money from Germany was well known, and this difficulty had now spread to Italy and the Balkans.It was more difficult to give any figures about the weaving industry, but a very large number of looms were standing-Idle, owing to the fact that the firms could not afford to pay the price demanded for imported coal. A good deal of distress was also taking place in certain parts of Lancashire,owing to the fact that some mills had been run on 10/- paid up shares. These mills had been gradually forced to call up their capital, and this was creating many bankruptcies amongst shareholders.WOOL.MR. ANDREWS wrote:-&quot;During the month of July, auction sales were held in London, with prices practically unchanged as compared with the sales in May.    The first few days of the opening of the series shewed strong competition from France and Germany. At the end of the first week, however, the slump in the Franc took place, with the result that the French buyers did not know where they stood and practically cease 1 buying for the remainder of the series.    There was, however, very strong competition from Germany, &apos; that market being bare of wool and experiencing a slight general Improvement in trade. Also, the competition from Bradford and the west Riding was a little better than one might reasonably expect at a time like the present with the Coal Stoppage.&quot;The position in Bradford is almost unchanged as compared with a month ago.    The difficulty is still rather one of obtaining orders than of obtaining coal to run.    Machinery has been employed in July fully as well as in June,-viz.,     about 50/60$ - with, if anything, a slight tendency to improve, but there is still the bogey of French competition at ridiculously low prices on account of the depreciated currency.&quot;It is difficult to say how Trade is likely to continue here, if the Coal Stoppage should last another month or more.      An improvement Is generally looked for
WOOL (Contd.)about the end of August - May, June and July generally being what are considered quiet months.   Whether the usual improvement will come along Is somewhat doubtful under the ciroumstances, but the market is not quite so pessimistic as it was a little while ago, and a better demand is found, for Tops for Spinning, especially in the finer qualities&quot;.CHEMICALS .MR. PERRY wrote:    &quot;I am able to report that by the increased aid of imported coal,  the British Chemical Industry has been able to practically maintain its normal output of all products sold for export.   Further,  that no marked increases of selling prioes have as yet occurred.   At the same time the cost of production of these commodities is undoubtedly enhanced by the increased cost to the manufacturer of foreign coal, and, therefore, the earning power of the Industry is being appreciably reduced.&quot;&quot;In the Home Trade,  production has had to be decreased owing to the consuming industries being unable to function,  In consequence of their inability to buy coal in quantity or at a price low enough to permit of manufacture without loss.&quot;POTTERY.MR. HOLLINS observed that the position in the pottery industry was somewhat similar to that of the previous month except that the August holiday was now being taken,     A few factories were running even in the holiday period, because their employees took their holidays earlier.   How long the present position of the industry would continue was uncertain, because it was to be feared that neither the outcrop coal nor the imported coal would be of much service to it.    There had been complaints of the dearness, of course, but the ohief point was the practicability.    They needed a long flame coal for their firing purposes j    and, after many trials, the foreign and outcrop coal had been found largely impracticable.The trade, had been fairly stationary for the last week or so, about two-thirds of the manufacturing being shut down.   This was not much reflected in the June export figures, except that the general earthenware trade, which was their staple trade, was down about 16%,    There was a serious falling of fain exports to Brazil and New Zealand,  which was affecting the trade considerably, but exports to China and electrical exports were higher.FOOD INDUSTRIES.SIR STANLEY&quot; MA CHIN,  speaking specially in connection with the food producing industry,   said that they were all feeling the effects of the coal strike, - not so far as manufacturing was concerned, beoause by one means or another they were all
POOD INDUSTRIES. (Gontd.)carrying on.     The foreign coal was helping;   Sir S. Machin had not heard of a single factory which had been seriously curtailing its output for want of fuel.   But what they were feeling was the decreased purchasing power caused by the coal strike, especially in the north.     The orders were smaller, and the want of confidence among buyers was such that many of the big buyers were absolutely refusing to plaoe contracts before a settlement had been arrived at. It was not desired to bring that forward as an argument for an unsatisfactory settlement.     Rather than have an uneconomic settlement we must go on.   An uneconomic settlement would be disastrous.The export trade to France and Belgium had gone, on account of the frano.   The other sections of the export trade were fairly steady.    In fact,  on the whole it might be said that there were signs of greater confidence in our overseas trade, which of course we wanted to see developed at all costs.   But, generally, trade was being carried on under distressed conditions.   Until the&apos; coal stoppage was settled we could not expect any great improvement.00-OPSRATIVE SOCIETIES,MR. GALLACRER reported that in Scotland the effects of the coal stoppage were being more severely felt than before.   For the past month,  the month of July,  the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society showed a decrease in each section of their business amounting to about ten per   cent, - groceries, drapery, boots and shoes and furniture.    Their current expenses and overhead expenses, however,  remained what they were, and the ten per cent, reduction would make all the difference between running at a profit and incurring a loss.    They expected that they were going to have a very bad half year.As to the miners who were out of work,  the only money they were getting was understood to be relief from the Parish Councils.     What they were getting from the Trade Unions was negligible.   Mr. Gallacher did not think that since the stoppage began they had had any more than  1 per man from strike funds.   And it was only those who were destitute and could make a claim for their wives and children under 14 years who were getting anything.   What they were doing was to eat up their surpluses in the co-operative Societies, share capital and so on,  and up to the present time that was the way in which the Wholesale Society was being affected.     But perhaps the retail societies were being affected just as much. There was always of.course in a period of stringency like this a considerable amount of buying, outside,  the cheaper qualities of food which were not stocked by the Co-operative Societies.    Perhaps a better index of the position was the way in which the debt to the Wholesale Society had gone up. It had increased since a year ago as much as 70 per cent,  294,271, which represented fully three weeks&apos; trade.     It used to be under two weeks, and it had sometimes been under one week.     That was debt from the Retail Societies to the Wholesale Society in the shape of goods which had not been paid for.    There was a large number of Retail Societies     however,
lieCO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES (Contd).that did not owe the Wholesale Society anything at all, and had a large floating balance at all times; but those Societies were also giving  \goods to their members, and not receiving money for them. Mr. Gallacher estimated that since the ooal stoppage began the Scottish Co-operative Societies had incurred a million rounds of debt. Of course a great deal of that would be covered by the loan capital and share capital. Prices were a little easier than a year ago,- chiefly in groceries. Boots, drapery and furniture prices were pretty steady.SIR THOMAS ALLEN said that the English Co-operative Wholesale Society&apos;s recent experience was somewhat different from that indicated by Mr. Gallacher far Scotland. June, the second month of the strike, showed, for the English Society, an increase in trade over June 1925, and only 1.5,  decrease as compared with March 1926. In particular, grocery and provisions showed an Increase of 9.9% over June last year and of 9.52 over March 1926.In woollens, drapery and furniture, the Society showed a considerable increase over the corresponding figures for last year, but an all-round decrease of about 25% from the figures for last March. The ooal distribution to customers was down about 83%, compared with both previous periods.The English Societyfs experience was similar to the Scotch in this, that they found that the co-operative customer was living a good deal on the past and withdrawing considerable share capital;    a good deal of the sales to customers were made on relief notes and someone would have to pay presently. Customers were keeping up their purchasing power In the main, but they were eating Into their savings. Generally speaking, the present crisis was nothing like so bad as had been anticipated;    and, as compared with the last coal crisis, it found the Co-operative Societies generally in a very much better position.GENERAL trade.MR. VYLE said that there was no improvement to report since last the Council met; if anything, the general depression-was more accentuated.   The high cost of fuel was beginning, to tell   very considerably on certain industries.    It was one thing for a firm to produce the orders that it already had, and to keep Its people going,  in the execution of those orders;    it was a very different thing to tender for new contracts and to look into the future and calculate what price    -one was likely to get. It was very difficult to quote competitively for the export trade with fuel at the price at which it was today, and in the uncertainty as to whether one wa3- going to get it at that price or not. There was one instance in particular which showed the effect of the high price of coal;    the fishing trade was roughly about normal, but on the East Coast all the bunkers were coming in from the Continent and the deep-sea trawlers estimated that the higher price added about  200 to their expenses for every round trip of about three weeks. That
IllGENERAL TRADE (COntd.)of course was Bure to put up the price of fish and,  to some extent, the general cost of living.In the retail trade generally there was great complaint all over the country of the restriction of money, which of course was bound to follow from large and heavy unemployment.BANKING.MR CURRIE observed that discount rates had been very steady at about 4-J per cent.    Deposits at the end of the half year were higher than they had been for some time.    Loans, Mr. Currie thought, were also slightly higher.    The violent fluctuations in the French and 3elgian exchanges had been somewhat troublesome, but there was nothing further of any particular importance to report.SHIPPING.SIR ALAN ANDERSON said there was very little change in regard to freights and shipping generally.    The coal strike had had a certain reaction.    The tramp freight rates were, he thought for the first time, higher this year than they had been last year;  i.e. 23.7 per cent of 1920 against 23.6 in June 1925;    that meant, in terms of 1913 freights,  101.3 against 101.1 per cent.    All the other signs, however, were bad, showing that British shipping was not able, even at the reduced prices, to carry on properly.    Tonnage laid up was higher than this time last year; - 359,000 tons as against 777,000.    Tonnage under construction in the United Kingdom stood at B41,000, 23 per cent, lower than the corresponding figure for last year.    Tonnage under construction abroad was less than last year, but not by so much;     it was 11 per cent less, and amounted to 1,129,000 tons.      Tonnage launched was considerably down, both here and abroad.Then there were a number of general points that the shipowners desired Sir Alan to mention.    The shipowners had been consulting with the principal coal consuming industries, and their views   were, shortly,  that all the industries depended on one another and all depended on coal, and an economic settlement was absolutely vital.    They thought it would be best for the Government to do nothing in the matter unless they could get an economic settlement.There had, also been trouble about flag discrimination in Spain, and we were having it now in Portugal; but Portugal seemed to British shipowners to present a chance to the British Government at the present moment of putting on a little pressure.    There was a new Government there who might be more ready to reconsider their policy and it was understood that they were wanting something done about their debts.
SHIPPING (Oontd.)As to the Danube, there were violent national jealousies stopping trade on that river, and British shipowners had thought all along that the European Commission on the Danube would be the one chance of smoothing these things down. It had evidently been much hampered for lack of funds, and the shipowners&apos; only suggestion was that any support of His Majesty Government could give the Commission would be in the interests of the nations generally.There was to be a Conference at Washington in 1927 to revise the Convention on Radio-Telegraphy.    The shipowners assumed that this Conference would be highly technical, and might not be the best possible body to consider the safety of life of sea in relation to wireless telegraphy.    They thought there were tremendous possibilities in wireless telegraphy, and when an automatic devioe became established it would not only make the seas much safer but would knock off a conaider-able source of expense, as the ships would not be carrying an unnecessary extra hand,    it seemed not merely to British shipowners, but to all shipowners,  that the safety of life at sea generally really deserved a separate meeting, and if that could be held in London before the Washington Conference it would be rather a good thing.Oil discharge was a very difficult subject.    All the shipowners agreed with the main lines of the proposed Convention, but regretted that although it would be forbidden to discharge oily waste within a certain distance from the land there was nothing about the provision of receptacles into which it was to be discharged.    It was in everybody&quot;s interest to prevent the pollution of coastal waters, and shipowners were not in favour of having compulsorily to carry separators, as a way of solving this problem;    but on the other hand they were afraid that the Convention would not be effective until there were receptacles.    in their view some dumping place was necessary for this .waste.    How it could be provided was another matter.The international Sanitary Convention, they thought, was a step in advance, and they hoped His Majesty&apos;s Government would help forward its ratification as soon as possible.As regards fire extinguishing appliances, the view of the shipowners was that it would be a very great pity if these new regulations were applied pending international consideration.    They involved expensive apparatus and were highly technical;  and it seemed to them a matter in which all the nations should try to move   forward together.    The regulations went into great detail, about which there was a good deal of difference of opinion,    it was understood, for instance, that the Cunard Company did not comply with them. They had much the same thing, but not the same in all respects, and they did not think the Regulations reasonable in all their details, although they liked the system.RAILWAY    TRAFFIC.MR.  HURCOMB said that from the published traffic returns it would seem that the gross receipts had increased, as he had said at the last Council meeting, by about  1,000,000 up to the end of April, compared with the corresponding figures for last year
CONFIDENTIAL.RAILWAY TRAFFIC (Oorxtd. ).but since the end of that month they had shown very large decreases.    As to the traffic, in May there was a decrease of 48/b in the number of passenger journeys, and as regards freight there was a decrease of 47$ in general merchandise, about 42$ in live stock, nearly 95$ in coal, and nearly 62$ in other minerals.    But that month reflected both the general strike and the coal stoppage, and one could not, of course, isolate the effects of the two.EMPLOYMENT.MR. PHILLIPS wrote:  &quot;Between 21st June and 19th July,  the unemployment total fell from 1,634,742 to 1,631,300.    The highest figure during July (and trie higheet during the stoppage) was on 5th July (1,545,070).&quot;Of the total inorease of about 650,000 between 26th April and 19th July, nearly 417,000 were under the heading &quot;Temporarily stopped&quot;.    The percentage increase was over 150 in the Midlands, 33 in Scotland, and only 15.4 in London and 9.4 in the South Western Division.    On the other hand the actual degree of unemployment at the end of July was in the neighbour-hood of 15$ in the Midlands, 17$ in Scotland, 22$ in Wales and 6$ in London.    Goal miners thrown out owing to the dispute are, of course, excluded throughout&quot;.CONDITIONS ABROAD.MR&apos;. BRAND thought that in the United States it looked as if money rates were going to be firm. There was considerable aotivity on the Stock Exchange there, prices were beginning to rise again, and the general opinion seemed to be that commercially and industrially they would be quite active in the autumn.    At the present moment the London discount rate was considerably higher than the rate in New York or Amsterdam or Switzerland; and money rates were comparatively low in Germany also.    The Bank Rate was 6$ in Germany and even at that the Reichsbank was not obtaining bills.    Gall money rates in Germany were anything between 3$ and 5$, and the discount was only a little above ours.    The demand for credit on London from the Continent appeared to be considerably reduced the last few months because our rates were higher than those in other centres.    People on the Continent who wanted credit found it cheaper to obtain it elsewhere than in London, although, if they needed large amounts,  they had to come bere.In France it seemed that the best opinion was that M.  Poincare had not yet really shown what he was going to do with much the most difficult problem, which was the currency, the actual stabilisation;  that he was taking vigorous measures to balance his Budget, but that, unless at the same time he could stop the exchange going down,  the balancing of the Budget was not sufficient by itself, and that he had got to settle fairly soon on what basis he would stabilise the Franc
CONDITIONS A BROAD . (Contd.)and also put into force-a very restrictive    credit policy which would he most unpopular.    Re was believed to have said that he was not going to have any more inflation or any more Bank Notes printed, but it was thought   quite impossible to do that, and that if he insisted on it the Government might find itself without funds.   The Sinking Fund plan appeared not to be entirely sufficient by itself to deal with the floating debt problem, because with prices rising manufacturers and industries must have more cash,   and the only way they could get it was by cashing in some of their Treasury Bills and National Defence Bonds.    It was therefore uncertain yet whether the plan was going to be successful, and he had only shown perhaps a quarter of what that plan was to be.In Belgium they had had a forced consolidation of their floating debt.   Holders of the floating debt were being obliged, to convert it into preference shares of the new railway rdgie, or to take up bonds of a fresh issue .   This forced consolidation of the floating debt had apparently been received with a fair amount of calmness, although a lot of small holders of Treasury Bonds who were looking for cash were very much Inconvenienced.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.MR. SANDERSON reported that the outlook in Australia was distinctly good, with the exception of the severe drought in the Gulf of Carpentaria and Northern and central Queensland.   In the pastoral and agricultural areas of the rest of the Continent there had been frequent rains and mild weather, but it was too early yet to say anything definite about the wheat crop.   At present its prospects were distinctly favourable,The average price for wool for the last twelve months had been  21. 13* 3d for greasy wool per bale,  and  24. 11. 7d for sooured.   About 33,500 bales remained in store et the 30th June out of a total clip of about 2-g- millions, which was very satisfactory.A measure had been Introduced into Parliament providing for the establishment of a Canned Fruit Export Control Board on similar lines to the Dairy Produce and Dried Fruits Boards, but it was not to operate until a majority of the canneries had expressed themselves in favour of it.     The usual Board of three members would include one Government representative as chairman, and a London agency would possibly be constituted.The export of butter in 1925-1926 to the United Kingdom amounted to 37,000 tons,  as compared with 58,000 in the previous year.   Just under half of those exports consisted in 1925-26 of what were called the choicest grade.   The outlook for the production of butter was distinctly good,  especially in Victoria and West Australia, but of course not including Queensland, where it was bad.The sugar crop in Queensland and New South Wales for 1926 was estimated to be 420,000 tons, which was a falling off, roughly,  of 100,000 tons compared with the previous year, when 519,000 tons were taken,
AUSTRALIAN TRADE (Contd.)Generally speaking, the prospects in Australia seemed to be quite good, provided prices for wool kept up.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.MR. HOSE wrote:    &quot;The most recent advices received from Chile indicate that trade conditions there remain dull, and the outlook appears to be overshadowed by uncertainty as to the immediate prospects in the nix2 ate-producing industry. In this connection,  it is to be regretted that, at conferences held in Valparaiso during the early part of last month between the Nitrate Producers&apos; Association and the representatives of European importers, no agreement was reached as to the most desirable steps to be taken.   Apparently,  the Chilean Government,  after an investigation into the actual costs of production to the companies, has come to the conclusion that the present situation does not call for action on their part by way of reducing export duties.   As a result of the present impasse,  sales are negligible,  as potential purchasers are naturally buying for immediate requirements only,  pending the settlement of a price policy.   In view of the overwhelming interest of the industry to Chile, however,  it is hardly to be expected that this question will be allowed to remain unsolved for any    indefinite period.    Indeed, reports are to hand suggesting that,  in view of the Government attitude,  the producers propose to clarify the position by reverting to free selling,   A sharp advance in prices of securities,  including several nitrate issues, on the Valparaiso Bourse during the past week, would appear, in part at least,  to confirm these reports.&quot;Official statistics of Chilean foreign trade during the first quarter of the current year show that the aggregate value of thirty five of the principal articles of importation was 52173,046,885 as compared with only  91,871,679 in the corresponding period of 1925.    The total value of twenty-nine of the principal exports in the same period was  510,213,168 (including $99,994,999 gold),  as against  .506,679,345.    The very substantial increase indicated in imports may not be unconnected with the effectual stabilisation of the exchange value of the peso during recent months *&quot;In Brazil, a severe measure of credit stringency has re-cently been experienced.    The steady improvement in the exchange value of the milreis which has occurred during bhe last twelve months has prejudiced the position of Importers holding stocks and of certain of the native industries by cheapening the prices of foreign goods.    The situation, especially among the textile mills of Sao Paulo,  is reported to be the worst for several years. The volume of business is greatly curtailed,  and the general trade depression is reflected in the Import markets.   Thus,  it is to be feared that the Brazilian population is experiencing the severe adjustments neoessarily accompanying the consistent adoption of a policy of deflation, designed to restore economic stability in the Republic   So soon as the present crisis is passed,  commercial conditions are not likely to be unsettled by any further sharp advanoe in exchange,  in view of the avowed policy of the Government to stabilise the sterling value of the milreis at or around 8d,
SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE (Contd,) .&quot;Trade conditions in Argentina,  in general, remain dull, but a slight improvement has recently been observable, together with indications of increasing confidence in respect to the immediate outlook.    Import business is still difficult, and Is expeoted to remain so,  pending liquidation of existing stooks.   A mild Winter has so   far been experienced, and dealers in woollen goods are reported to have large stocks on hand.    The textile and hardware trades are dull, but building construction is active.   Argentine wheat exports this year have been substantially below those of last year, but, on the other hand,  shipments of linseed, maize, and oats have been very much greater.   Although grain prices are generally below last year&apos;s level, it is expected that the increased volume of shipments will counterbalance the fall in prices.    The linseed crop just harvested was a record, while the second official estimate of the yield of maize places this at 7,100,000 tons,  the highest figure reported for the. past nine years.   Shipments of these grains have been proceeding on a satisfactory scale&quot;,FAR EASTERN TRADE.MR. LANDALE stated that British shipping was still being run at a loss on the China coast, and there was no improvement in the situation in the South,There was some demand In China for piece goods, but the political position was hindering import business in every direction.   As regards exports from China, there was more demand for crushing seeds, but at poor prices.   Dealers were unwilling to contract ahead owing to the disturbed condition in the country.     For silk there was a better demand from America, but not many orders were coming from Europe,      For that market Italian silks were at present cheaper.There was little improvement to report as regards the railway situation.   Where the lines were not dominated by the military some recovery of earning power was being shown, but this was strictly limited by the  damaged condition of bridges and rolling stock.     The loan service of the Peking Mukden Railway due 1st August had been met out of reserves kept for that purpose, which were now depleted.     A great deal of money would have to be spent in rehabilitating this line before its normal revenue of 23 million dollars per annum could be reached,,  even assuming there was no further military interference.   Nearly two thirds of the Tientsin pukow Railway was at present controlled by the military Governor, Sun Chuang Feng, who was showing some regard for its use as a public service and for the foreign obligations under the loan agreement.    The Canton Government had publicly declared its usurpation of the Canton Kowloon Railway from the Central Government without, however, accepting responsibility for its loan obligations,Mr. Landale added that there was some enquiry in China for machinery, but very little business was resulting.   Sir Arthur Balfour observed that he could fill his whole works up with Chinese business if he could take the risk as to payments,
