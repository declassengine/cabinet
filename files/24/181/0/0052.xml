[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1926.SECRET.Serial No. 30CP. 352 (26).Also C.I.D. 726-B.CABINET.CHEMICAL  WARFARE  POLICY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.IN view of forthcoming discussions, I circulate herewith for the information of the Cabinet a note by the Air Staff on Chemical Warfare Policy.1. The alternative courses open to the British Government in regard to the Geneva Gas Protocol of 1925 are : (a.) To ratify forthwith, independently of other signatories.(6.) To urge ratification on other Powers on the understanding that we willratify simultaneously. (c.) To adopt a neutral attitude until other Powers have signified their intentions and to ratify only if all other Powers do so. (d.) Not to ratify at all.Of the above courses, the admiralty advocate (a) (C.I.D. 707-B), the Foreign Office suggest (b) (C.I.D. 706-B), whilst the Army Council prefer (d) (C.I.D. 709-B).2. In view of the statistics prepared by the War Office (723-B) in regard to gas casualties, the Air Staff must point out that there are certain fundamental differences between operations carried out by aircraft and those conducted by armies.In an Army operation, even when gas is used, nearly the whole of the casualties due to enemy action occur amongst combatant troops. These are supplied with respirators, in the use of which they are fully trained, and measures for effective decontamination of clothing and areas can readily be taken. Hence the number of fatal casualties is comparatively small.In air operations, particularly during raids against objectives in thickly populated areas, casualties occur almost entirely amongst civilians. The aeroplane is essentially a vehicle suitable for the conveyance of gas, and therefore its ever increasing range renders more and more civilians liable to gas attack in war.The difficulties of equipping with gas masks all the inhabitants of cities, and of training large numbers of civilians in anti-gas measures, are considerably greater than in armies (vide C.I.D. Papers Nos. 134-A, 135-A); the inhabitants of densely populated areas are consecuiently more vulnerable to gas attack, especially if this is accompanied by high explosive bombs, than are troops in the field.S. H.Air Ministry, October 15, 1926.CHEMICAL   WARFARE   POLICY.Note by the Air Staff.[15183]
3. The extent to which reliance can safely be placed on international agree-ments prohibiting the use of particular weapons of war is a question of considerable difficulty. If Great Britain were to ratify the Gas Protocol, despite the knowledge that some at least of the other Powers would not do so, or that certain of the signatories might not on emergency honour their undertaking, this country would be placed in a most dangerous position.Preparations both for offensive gas war and for defensive measures would be bound to suffer neglect, and the proximity of London to the continent would become a disadvantage increasing with the development of methods of gas war.4. The Air Staff, therefore, consider it advisable to delay taking any action for or against ratification of the Protocol until the intentions of other Powers have been clearly signified.
