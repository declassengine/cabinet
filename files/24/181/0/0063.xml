II.-POSITION  IN  CHIEF  INDUSTRIES. COAL MINING.The,continuance of the coal dispute and the absence of the usual statistics as to the number of workpeople unemployed preclude any detailed analysis of the position in this industry.IRON AND STEEL.Employment in the heavy metal industries was still seriously affected by the coal dispute, but some little improvement was shown during the last two months of the quarter. In the tinplate industry, while the improvement was more marked, many mills were still idle and much short-time working was reported. In pig-iron manu-facture an increase in unemployment occurred during September.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.Although a slight improvement in employment took place during the month of July, the position considerably worsened during the two subsequent months. In all districts a large amount of work was suspended owing to the shortage of coal and steel supplies.ENGINEERING.There was little change in the position in this industry during the quarter. In general engineering an improvement in July was followed by a slight increase in unemployment during August and September. Marine engineering was also adversely affected, but in electrical engineering the position remained more satis-factory. The decline in motor engineering can to a certain extent be attributed to seasonal slackness.TEXTILES.Cotton. The position in this industry fluctuated considerably during the quarter, a considerable increase in unemployment during July being followed by a somewhat larger decrease during August. In September there was a further slight increase in unemployment, and much under-employment is still prevalent.Woollen and Worsted. The improvement which-took place in the woollen and worsted industry towards the end of the quarter was largely accounted for by seasonal causes.Other Textiles. On the whole, there has been little change in the hosiery, lace and silk trades, the two first-named showing a slight improvement over the quarter. In the jute industry, after a considerable rise in unemployment during July, the numbers decreased rapidly in the following month. At the end of the quarter the number unemployed had been reduced by approximately one-half.BUILDING. BRICK AND TILE MANUFACTUREDEmployment in the building industry continued to be seriously affected by a shortage of materials. During the last month there was some seasonal slackness, chiefly evident amongst painters and carpenters. In brick and tile manufacture increased supplies of fuel resulted in a slight reduction in unemployment.CLOTHING TRADES.Seasonal causes brought about a considerable increase in unemployment in the clothing trades during the quarter. The increase was most marked in the tailoring branch. The position in the boot and shoe industry became somewhat more satis-factory towards the end of the period.POTTERY.A marked recovery took place in this industry mainly owing to the increased supplies of coal which became available.TRANSPORT, DOCK LABOUR AND SHIPPING SERVICES.Some improvement was shown in these services during the quarter, and on the railways a greater amount of work was available. Employment at the docks showed little change as compared with the previous quarter, the only improvements of importance being in respect of labour employed in dealing with imports of fuel.
III. WORK INSTITUTED FOR RELIEF OF UNEMPLOYMENT.Numbers Employed.[See note on page 1 of November 1924 Report (CP. 541 (24) ).]The table which follows has been prepared to show, so far as information is available, the number of men employed on works instituted, with financial assistance horn the Exchequer or the Road Fund, for the relief of unemployment.Scope of Table. The schemes included are those undertaken by Local and other Authorities and Public Companies with a financial contribution from the State with the object of relieving unemployment; certain schemes put in hand by Government Departments for the same purpose; and works in respect of which guarantees have been given under the Trade Facilities Acts as capital undertakings calculated to promote employment in this country. Schemes to which State financial assistance is given, but which are not undertaken primarily for the relief of unemployment (e.g., Housing Schemes), and works put in hand by Local Authorities without State assistance are not included. Certain other schemes involving Government assistance are also excluded in view of the impracticability of ascertaining the exact number of men who are directly provided with employment thereby; these include the Export Credits Scheme and contracts for equipment, clothing, &amp;c, accelerated by Government Contracting Departments.Method of Compilation. The figures for the Road and Bridge Schemes assisted by the Ministry of Transport and for schemes assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee are (with the exception of certain road schemes in respect of which returns are received direct by the Ministry of Transport) obtained from returns received at Employment Exchanges from Local and other Authorities and Public Companies. Those relating to schemes assisted under the Trade Facilities Acts are compiled by the Trade Facilities Act Advisory Committee from returns received from Companies to whom guarantees under the Acts have been given. In the case of the remaining works the figures are compiled or estimated by the Departments mentioned. The figures given for September 1925, which have been prepared (so far as information is available) on the same basis as that now in use, provide an approximately accurate comparison.Works assisted by 	Number of Men employed at 				Sept.25,1926.JAug. 28,1926.

The figures take no account of the employment provided indirectly, e.g., in the preparation and transport of materials, &amp;c.t Scheme completed. ,     ,I These figures indicate me a employed on the work itself. They include part only of the men employed ou the manufacture of the materials used. They take no account of the labour involved in winning, transporting, &amp;c, raw materials.J\rote^s0 distinction is now made between the Forestry Commissions normal and relief work, and grants for afforestation form part of the normal programme. The average number of men employed on the Commissions operations (including Crown woods) during the quarter ended September 30th, 1926, was 2,493 as compared with 2,133 for the corresponding quarter of 1925.
IV.-OVERSEAS SETTLEMENT. (Colonial Office.)Under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922 (an Act to make better provision for furthering British settlement in His. Majesty&apos;s Oversea Dominions), various schemes have been agreed with Dominion Authorities. This Act, as its title implies, is not one of the Government measures designed to deal with unemployment, and should not be so regarded. It should be borne in mind that the excess of the total outward over the total inward movement from this country is somewhat less than 100,000 a year, and therefore small in comparison with the natural increase of population which for many years before and after the war has not been much less than 400,000 a year.The number of persons approved for assistance and the number of departures during the months of July, August and September (with the corresponding figures for last year) and for the six months ended the 30th September, 1926 and 1925, respectively, are set out in the following Table:-Quarterly Progress Return relating to Schemes approved under &quot; The Empire Settlement Act, 1922.&quot;Approval and Departure Figures.

The Scheme, however, closed to new applications in December 1922.

Expenditure by Poor Law Authorities, A (England and Wales), B (Scotland).These Statistical Tables have been compiled with a view to showing the extent of the effort from public sources since the Armistice to meet the problems of Post-War Resettlement and Unemployment, and to indicate the measure of assistance provided by the Exchequer. With regard to the latter, the methods of financial co-operation are so diverse that it is impracticable to give an aggregated figure of Exchequer Assistance. For this reason, the accompanying Summary is only indicative of the extent to which the Exchequer is involved, and must be regarded as supplementary to, and not in substitution of, the detailed information given in the Tables themselves.Summary.

The cost of the Overseas settlement free passage scheme for ex-Service men and women and their dependants (now rapidly approaching termination), which up to 31st March, 1926, had amounted to approximately  2,419,450, is not included in this table. Neither is the cost included of certain training of ex-Service men carried out in Ireland at a cost to the Imperial Exchequer of approximately  255,425.
Unemployment Insurance. (Estimates, Class VII, Vote 3.)The National Insurance Act of 1911 provided Insurance against unemployment in certain selected industries. It was followed by the Act of 1916, which increased the numbers of persons insured, and, in 1920, by an Act of general scope which applied compulsory Insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions of receipt of benefit, increased contributions, provided benefit in respect of dependants, and authorised the Treasury to make advances out of the Consolidated Fund up to a limit of  30,000,000.By the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1924, the rates of benefit were raised (from 15s.) to 18s. a week for men, and (from 12s.) to 15s. a week for women, with 2s.

Until the 30th June, 1926, since extended by the Act of 1926 to the 31st December, 1927, benefit in respect of contributions may be paid for 26 weeks in a benefit year, while benefit, irrespective of contributions, may be paid during unemployment subject to the satisfaction of special conditions. The Act also amends the disqualification for benefit in the case of persons affected by trade disputes, and it abolishes the right to a refund of contributions at the age of 60, subject to the payment of compensation for the loss of refund rights in certain cases.Statement of Income and Expenditure from Armistice to October 2, 1926.Expenditure                     Benefit paid         ....          ....          .... 268,629,000Appropriation for Administration   .... 25,721,000Section 9 Unemployment InsuranceAct (No. 2), 1924         ....          .... 1,495,000Miscellaneous Refunds, &amp;c.....          ....          .... 3,074,000--   298,919,000Income Contributions Employers............ 101,528,000Employed            ............ 91,673,000Exchequer           ........          .... 68,577,000Exchequer (for ex-Service Men)       .... 3,600,000--   265,378,000Interest (Net)................ 271,000Balance of Old Fund at Armistice (excluding Interest accrued) * Employers           ............ 5,825,000Employed            ............ 5,825,000Exchequer           ............ 3,884,00015,534,000Loans from Treasury (Net)....          ....          .... 16,920,000Miscellaneous Deposits in respect of future  Contribu-tions, &amp;c.....          ....          ....          .... 816,000298,919,000* Noin.--The old Fund at November 8th, 1920, had reached a total of  22,210,000.Estimate of Benefit payable from Armistice to March 31, 1927,  292,126,000.

Ministry of Transport Schemes.Road and Bridge Programme, 1919-20. To assist in the provision of employment for demobilised members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces until such time as they could be re-absorbed into industry, the Government after the Armistice inaugurated a special fund for the purpose of making grants on certain conditions to Highway Authorities for road work. The total of such grants has amounted to approximately  9,328,000 for Great Britain and it is estimated that the works carried out by Local Authorities in order to earn n grant aggregated in cost to approximately  20,000,000.Unemployment Works assisted out of the Road Fund. 1920-23 Programmes.The first &quot; Unemployment Programme &quot; proper was initiated by the Ministry of Transport in the Winter of 1920/21, and the following statement shows the total estimated expenditure by the contributing parties to date and a forecast of expendi-ture during subsequent years, against the three programmes instituted prior to October 1923.
February 1924 Programme.A further additional programme estimated to cost  13,500,000 was authorised by the late Government, towards which the Road Fund was to contribute a maximum of  10,400,000. Owing to the inclusion of certain road schemes previously covered by earlier programmes, the estimated cost and the amount of the Road Fund contribution now show a slight increase. This programme includes the construction of the Liverpool-Salford road.The following statement shows the expenditure by the contributing parties to the end of 1925/26 and a forecast of expenditure during subsequent years: Payments during Year.

Table 4. Land Settlement.In England and Wales the provision of small holdings under the Land Settle-ment (Facilities) Act, 1919, and other Land Settlement Schemes for the benefit primarily of ex-Service men, are carried out (a) through the agency of County Councils and Councils of County Boroughs and (&amp;) through the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.Settlement through Local Atithorities. The net capital cost of these schemes up to the 31st March, 1926, when the Land Settlement Scheme came to an end, is estimated to be  15,250,000, of which approximately  14,050,000 (net) was loaned by the Public Works Loan Board. Interest in respect of such loans is payable by Councils. Under Section 26 of the Land Settlement (Facilities) Act, 1919, the Exchequer bears the loss incurred up to the 31st March, 1926, on the Councils&apos; Small Holdings account (e.g., due to charging a fair as opposed to an economic rent), so far as such loss had been reasonably and necessarily incurred.As from the 1st April, 1926, the Exechequer assistance takes the form of annual contributions to meet the difference between the loan charges and the estimated net income from the Councils&apos; estates. These contributions will not commence until the year 1927-28 and their total capitalized value cannot at present be estimated.In Scotland land settlement is not conducted through the agency of County Councils.Ministry&apos;s Settlements. Since the Armistice a number of properties have been acquired, and the capital expenditure thereon and the difference, if any, between the annual cost of maintaining and administering them and the rents received from small holders is being borne by the Exchequer. Some of these properties have been disposed of and the net expenditure on the remainder does not involve an appreciable cash call upon the Exchequer, as additional capital expenditure is met from the surplus cash revenue or from proceeds of sale of property.Land Settlement.(A.)

Juveniles.After the Armistice, Juvenile Unemployment Centres were opened in certain localities to deal with the problem of unemployed juveniles. After a period of closure centres were again established, and the cost, which was originally shared bythe Board of Education and Local Authorities, was, from the 1st April, 1923, to the 31st March, 1924, partly met out of Relief of Unemployment Vote by grants up to 75 per cent, in respect of approved schemes, the Local Authority providing the remaining 25 per cent. From the 1st April, 1924, the Exchequer Grant was, as an emergency measure, for so long as unemployment amongst juveniles remains acute, raised to 100 per cent, of the approved out-of-pocket expenses of Local Education Authorities.From the 1st April, 1926, the Exchequer Grant was revised as follows : (1.) To Authorities in whose areas the average rate of unemployment among insured juveniles exceeded 6 per cent, during the twelve months which ended on the 23rd November, 1925.A per capita grant fixed by the Minister for each Authority separately equal to the approved average weekly cost to the Authority of each Juvenile in average attendance, taking into account recurrent expenditure only, during the twelve months which ended on theT30th June, 30th September, or 31st December, 1925, whichever was the latest period for which consecutive claims had been received. If complete figures for one year ending on one of the above dates were not available, or if the Authority had not previously opened Centres, the per capita grant was fixed by the Minister on such information, including the Authority&apos;s proposals for 1926/27, as was available to him.(2.) To Authorities in whose areas the average rate of unemployment among insured juveniles was not less than 3 per cent, and not more than 6 per cent, during the twelve months which ended on the 23rd November, 1925.Either (i) a per capita grant calculated as in (1) above, but equal to three-quarters only of the approved average weekly cost, or (ii). a grant of 75 per cent, of the approved out-of-pocket expenditure incurred by the Authority during the financial year 1926/27, as the Authority chose.Schemes fob, Training Women and Juveniles and Young Unemployed Fit Men.(Estimates, Unclassified Services, Vote 2.)(a.) Women.The following table aggregates: (i) the expenditure incurred wholly by theMinistry of Labour in connection with the Registered Unemployed Women&apos;s Scheme which operated from 1919 to 1921; (ii) the expenditure on schemes for training women in Domestic Service, &amp;c., under the auspices of the Central Committee  or Women&apos;s Training. Up to the 31st July, 1924, the cost of this scheme was met partly from Exchequer Grants and party from other sources, but, as from the 1st August, 1924, the whole cost has been borne by the Exchequer.
(3.) To Authorities in whose areas the average rate of unemployment among insured juveniles was less than 3 per cent, during the year which ended on the 23rd November, 1925.Normally no grant is payable, but if in the case of a County Council the Authority can show that there are clearly defined districts where the average percentage of insured juveniles unemployed during the year was definitely abnormal, the Minister is prepared in approved cases to sanction grant as in (2) above in respect of expenditure on Centres serving these districts.In the case of approved Centres established by Authorities who are Authorities for elementary education, only grant is paid under (1) or (2) above, according to the percentage of unemployment among insured juveniles in the area of the Authority for elementary education only, provided that the proposal of the Authority has received the concurrence of the County Authority concerned.Net Expenditure from Armistice to March 31,1926.

The last scholarship terminated in December, 1921.(c.) Young Unemployed Fit Men.The Ministry of Labour is conducting, as an experimental measure, a scheme of training for the benefit of young unemployed men between the ages of 19 and 25 (up to 29 for ex-service men) of a class who, owing to the prolonged trade depression, have had no opportunity of learning a skilled trade. Two urban and two rural centres have been established.   The length of each course of training is six months.Estimated Expenditure to March 31. 1926.	Provision for 1926/27.
