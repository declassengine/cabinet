2%k&quot;eREASUEY CLAMBERS.8 th September,  1926.Dear Mr. Evan Williams,1 have to thank you on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government for having deferred, to our earnestly expressed wish that the Mining Association should consult its constituents, upon the question of resuming national negotiations for a settlement of the coal dispute.       I take this opportunity of explaining the kind of three party conference that the Government have in view and the scope of its work.Hitherto national settlements have prescribed the way in which the percentages payable from time to time in the districts shall be determined,  viz.,  the ratio of division, .the intervals of ascertainment,  the principles of recoupment, the definition of &quot;other costs&quot;, and the mimimum percentage payable.      Jhay have set up a National Board for the industry.      They havo laid down the principle of subsistence wages to be determined In the districts.      Ihoy have defined the various districts and made provision for their alteration by local agreement.It is obviously quite impossible in the present circumstances for any conference sitting in London to do more in the first instance than lay down certain broad principles and recommend the practical steps necessary to secure an early and unive rsal resumption of work.We believe that with such national guidance the task of negotiating agreements on wages, hours and other conditions could be undertaken in each district with the assent of both parties under favourable conditions and without any further
delay.    We oannot afford, any xturthar&quot;delay or long oeremonisl procedure.   At least 1, 700vfXXl-rfaEuMLies affected by tho dispute are looking for t h e--oqapoorturrit^&apos; of regaining their weekly wages.    Our procedure must be planned tc bring this about as quickly as possible on--&apos; fair and sound terms.District settlements conoluded in conformity with the agreed general principles should form a basis on which work would be immediately resumed.    In so far as they dealt with matters which by custom, are settled nationally thoy would require to be -referred to the central body for confirmation f-r where necessary for referenoe back to the district.    It ought not thon to be dlffiouit to oonolude a national agreement governing many,  if not all,  of the points that have hitherto been dealt with on a national basis.    One point of difficulty no doubt will be how the national character of the Minimum can be reconciled with the Inevitable allovmnce for district conditions.     We ought not to assume that this is insoluble with good will once the parties are together.After prolonged thought His Majestyfs Government believe that this is about the bast and shortest path that can be found to reach tho vital objeot in view, namely a businesslike and honourable settlement for a good long time.Yours sincerely,vYINSTOJSf S. OBUEOHILL.
