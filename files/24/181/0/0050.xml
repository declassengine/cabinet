DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVBEffiHIENT-) .INTERIM REPORT OP THE INTER,&apos; JmWmV&amp;h. COMMITTEE PIT GRANTS . OBSgHVATIOTS BY THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR SOOT^AJTOM0R.4NJjrM.gY THE PREgllDENI gP THE BfriRJD OP gPTJCATION (0. P. 519/26)1.      I agree with the President as to the desirability of further onquiry into the general problem of a Unified  look Grant system, and also as to the political danger nf d^ing anything which would upset the Burnham Award.2.     ;I further agree as to the disadvantages which might attend the postponement of any attempt to introduce a Blcok Grant system now.     While fully alive tn these, however, I am satisfied that it would be wiser to go on as we are, with4possibly an extended applicaticn of th* principled rationing, rather than to initiate a new system which would inevitably add fresh complications to a situation that is already complicated enough.3.      I would gladly have accepted any Interim Scheme which I could have regarded as capable cf preparing the way for a permanent settlement.      But, so far as I understand that out-lined in the Memorandum, it does not seem to me to fulfil this essential condition.      The following are some of the points that give me pausa. ,(a)    I am decidedly uneasy as to the possible effects of the suggested Development Grant.     One part of it, for instance, is tp be based upon &quot;new work&quot;.     And &quot;new work&quot; is simply another way of saying &quot;fresh expenditure&quot;. Another is tn be related tr/&quot;non-recurring expenditure&quot; and will therefore be in the nature of a Capital Grant, a form cf subsidy that disappeared long ago from our educational finance.SSCRJT.350/26CABINET.ON THE
(b)    I do net find in the Memorandum any specific recommendation fcr the repeal cf the statutory guarantee cf a Deficiency Grant.      If this is to stand, any Develop-ment Grant fcr London and the ether deficiency&apos; areas -and,  in the circumstances, these are the areas which are most certain to develop - would inevitably mean a 50 per cent, grant upen new expenditure.      And, when these areas are being treated so generously, their poorer neighbours cannot in equity be offered less.(c.)    Without more definite information as to the &quot;new grant formula&quot; I cannot guarantee that its intro-duction would not have a seriously disturbing effect upon the existing Scottish system, which has been favourably commented upen by the Colwyn Ocmmittoc.4.     My considered opinion, therefore, is that negotiations with the Local Authorities should not be opened up until the Cabinet has been able to reach a quite definite decision as to the lines on which these are to be conducted.&quot;J.G.&quot;lottish Office,I   15th October,   1926.
