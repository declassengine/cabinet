CONFIDENTIAL.[This Document isritannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]NOTE  ON  THE  COMMERCIALISATION OF  GERMAN  REPARATION BONDS  AND  OTHER SIMILAR SCHEMES.IN view of the recrudescence in the foreign press and possibly also at the Thoiry meeting between M. Briand and Dr. Stresemann of the idea of the extension by Germany of financial assistance to France and Belgium in return for political concessions, it seems desirable that the great financial difficulties and dangers involved in these schemes should be appreciated.2. The schemes in question if, in view of their extreme vagueness, they can be called schemes fall into two main groups, viz. : (i.) The &quot; commercialisation &quot; of the German reparation debt and particularly the marketing of the Railway and Industrial Debentures created under the Dawes Plan (more especially for the benefit of France), (ii.) The repurchase by Germany (for the benefit of France) of the Saar Mines ceded to France, or (for the benefit of Belgium) of the Eupen-Malmedy territory ceded to Belgium, under the Treaty of Versailles.3. The &quot; commercialisation &quot; of German reparations is no new question. It is a chimera which has been indefatigably pursued by successive French and Belgian Governments ever since the signature of the Peace Treaty. Annex II of Part VIII of the Peace Treaty permitted the issue and marketing of German bonds; and schemes to give practical effect to the Treaty arrangements were discussed at each successive inter-Allied Conference that took place during 1920 and 1921. None of these schemes came to anything; and the discussions resulted merely in statements of theoretical principle. For instance, by article 3 of the Spa Conference in 1922, the Allied Governments recognised that it was &quot; in the general interest &quot; to arrive at an agreement embodying &quot; the faculty for Germany to free herself at an earlier date by discounting some or all of her reparation annuities &quot; and &quot; the issue by Germany of loans destined,&quot; inter alia, &quot; for the prompt discharge of its debts to the Allied Powers,&quot; and &quot; the Allied Governments declared their readiness to take among themselves such measures as they may deem appropriate to facilitate an agreement of this kind.&quot; Again, the Bonar Law plan put forward by the British Government at the abortive conference in Paris in January 1923 contained, as one of its principal features, a provision under which Germany had the power to redeem the bonds to be issued under that plan at a discount, commencing at 50 per cent, in 1923, and gradually diminishing each year thereafter. Incidentally, this was one of the features in that plan which was particularly attacked by M. Poincare on the ground that it enabled the German Government to extinguish their reparation debt on too favourable terms.4. The Dawes Committee followed the lead of previous discussions, but in a more guarded manner. Their scheme provided for the creation of two issues of bonds, primarily as collateral security for reparation payments, viz., 11 milliard gold marks ( 550,000,000) of first mortgage bonds secured on the German Railways, and a further 5 milliard gold marks ( 250,000,000) of debentures secured on German industry; and they intimated in vague and general terms the possibility of marketing these bonds. &quot; The annuity figures,&quot; they said, &quot; clearly do not include the proceeds from the sale of capital assets which may be effected by the creditor Governments. As soon as the plan is put into execution, the Reparation Commission will be in possession of bonds for 16 milliard marks ( 800,000,000), which may he sold to the extent to which the financial markets are capable of absorbing them.&quot; There was never any serious expectation that marketing on this scale or anything approaching it would, in fact, be possible. Tho Trustees appointed under the plan to supervise the bond arrangements have made numerous attempts to sound the markets for much more moderate amounts; but have never met with any encouragement.5. The Transfer Committee, which was consulted by the Trustees in April 1925, expressed the view that, while thev appreciated the desirability of putting theI. Commercialisation of the German Reparation Debt.[15080]b
Railway Bonds on an investment basis, &quot; the prospects of sale would depend primarily upon the intrinsic merits of the bonds and would be determined by the credit of the German Railway Company, its record of operation and earnings, and tne general record which is established with regard to the stability of Germany and the progress of the Experts&apos; Plan &quot; ; and they indicated that the investment markets could not yet form a judgment on these points. The Trustee for the Railway Bonds in his last Report (June 1926) stated that &quot; after numerous discussions with the bankers of the various countries &quot; he had been convinced &quot; by the unanimous view of interested quarters that it would be imprudent and consequently prejudicial to the operation as a whole to take it in hand at the present time.&apos;&apos; He added that he felt confident none the less that !&apos; he would be able at the favourable moment to profit by all possible sources of support for the successful accomplishment of the task with which  he was entrusted.&quot;6. As this last statement appeared to indicate that the Trustee considered that he had a mandate to negotiate the bonds, when this report came before the Repara-tion Commission, Lord Blanesburgh, the British Delegate, pointed out that no decision in principle as to the sale of the bonds had yet been taken. This hint that the Trustee would have to consult the Reparation Commission and could only act on their instruction was accepted by the other members of the Commission.7. In theory, there is much to be said for converting the political reparations debt of Germany held by Governments into a market obligation held by private investors which could not be repudiated without disastrous effects to the whole structure of German commercial credit.But any theoretical approval is severely conditioned by questions of possibility, opportunity, scope and method.8. The German Government have handed over in turn (1) the original bonds provided for by the Treaty; (2) the revised bonds issued under the Schedule of Payments of the 5th May, 1921; and (3) the bonds issued under the Dawes Plan. But the bonds have, in each case, remained in the safe of the Reparation Commission. No market issue has yet been attempted because of the inherent practical difficulties of floating any issue of reasonable magnitude on sufficiently favourable terms9. Mobilisation of the German debt could only be effected if and when the Allied Powers have come to a final settlement with Germany of her total aggregate reparation obligations at a much lower figure than anything as yet contemplated. A debt of  2,000,000,000 can clearly not be mobilised in full, and bears no relation to the dimensions of market investment, now that war inflation no longer operates. It is not even conceivable that the market could ever absorb the  800 million of Railway and Industrial Bonds. Some day a settlement on a commercial basis, involving a further and more drastic writing down of the reparation debt than any that has yet occurred may take place; and marketing may become a practical proposition. But such a writing down of German payments is hardly conceivable unless there is a simultaneous reduction of European debts to the United States of America. The moment for this has clearly not yet arrived; and marketing of German Bonds before that moment comes is only likely to postpone and hamper a general settlement. This is the great danger of such suggestions as are now made in the French Press for a partial marketing for the benefit of France alone.10. Further, the Dawes Bonds are singularly unsuited for marketing. They are supposed to carry 5 per cent, interest plus a 1 per cent. Sinking Fund; but the payments during the earlier years are at reduced rates of interest, and the full payments only commence to accrue in the year commencing September 1927. Then, again, the bonds are denominated in &quot; gold marks,&quot; but the German payments are in Reichsmarks, i.e., the bonds represent a theoretical payment in gold, but not an effective gold currency, and any market issue would probably have to be denominated in dollars or sterling. Further, the payment of the service of the bonds may at any time be held up by the action of the Transfer Committee. Finally, as has been pointed out, the investment market would have to be satisfied with the security behind the bonds, and although the experience up to date of the Dawes Plan has been satisfactory, the real test has not yet come as the full scale of payments is not reached till two years hence and until then it is premature to say whether the various safeguards in the plan will be strong enough to support the strain.In the meanwhile any issue, however small, offered on the market could only be placed at a very substantial discount, not only because of these technical disadvantages, but because of the knowledge that there was a vast further corpus
up to  800 million to come. The issue would almost certainly have to be given special rights of priority in regard to transfers which would so gravely affect the security for the remainder of the reparation debt as to make it very doubtful if the Transfer Committee could properly allow such priority. Possibly also a guarantee by the German Government of payment in gold would be demanded and could only be obtained by the grant of concessions in regard to the other obligations of Germany. Even so, however, owing to the limited investment capacity of the world, the amount that could be floated even with the active aid of the United States would be insignificant compared with the total volume of the reparation debt, and it is dubious policy to risk the future receipts under the Dawes Plan for the sake of a small anticipation of capital. It must be remembered that the highest figure suggested by the Trustees for any possible market issue in the near future is 2 milliards of gold marks ( 100 millions), which, even if it could be realised, would be substantially less than the amount of the payment which Germany is due to make each year from 1928 onwards (viz.,  125 millions).11. Some of these difficulties would be reduced by the passage of time and the continued success of the Dawes Plan; others (e.g., the change of currency and possibly the Government guarantee) could be got round, but the difficulty of getting any really large block of these bonds absorbed on the markets of the world, without compromis-ing all other receipts-from Germany, threatens to be insoluble. For example, it might conceivably pay the Allies to realise on a yield basis of (say) 1\ per cent, a block of German payments, which carries interest at 5 per cent, only, if it represented the last block of such payments. But if in addition to transferring to the private investor  150 of the capital German debt for every  100 of the capital thus realised bv anticipation, the Allied Powers have to concede a priority on all future transfers of reparation, they would be paying much too high a price for their accommodation. Such a priority had to be granted to the German Reconstruction Loan of  40 millions (i.e., the Transfer Committee undertook to secure the foreign exchange required to cover the service of the loan in priority to all other transfers under the Dawes Plan, and in consequence they are bound to restrict and even to suspend all current reparation payments if necessary for that purpose). As a result, the service of the Reconstruction Loan now absorbs the first  5^miilions transferred each year in cash out of the Dawes annuities. Each successive flotation would require a further priority over current reparation transfers; and as the market investors became more numerous the Transfer Committee would tend to become more and more apprehensive of the effect on the service of these loans of any considerable current reparation payments. In the end, it might well be found that the service of, say,  400 millions of market debt could only be assured by the stoppage of all current transfers to the Allies, and the latter would have sacrificed their claims on Germany for an absurdly low composition, as compared with what they could have derived from nursing their assets and taking the income as it accrued. From the point of view of His Majesty&apos;s Government it would be particularly bad business in so far as we would be paying a discount for realising the capital of reparations, whereas, we would get no discount for redeeming in advance our debt to the United States of America. &quot;We cannot afford to have our annual cash receipts from Germany converted into a relatively smaller capital sum which we provide ourselves by buying German bonds.12. It must also be borne in mind that apart from any special priority the mobilisation of a block of reparation bonds can scarcely fail to have a serious indirect effect on current reparation transfers. The amount of German bonds which can be absorbed by foreign markets is limited, not merely by the accumulation of savings in the lending countries, but by the willingness of the private investor to put those savings into German investments. Since the inauguration of the Dawes Plan, Germany has raised over  200 millions of foreign borrowings i.e., an amount considerably in excess of the total reparation payments transferred to the Allies under the plan. Though a2-)art from the Reconstruction Loan the German borrowings have been of a mainly commercial character, the effect of these loans has been to supply Germany with large quantities of foreign exchange and they have contributed materially to the ease with which, up to date, the reparation transfers-under the Dawes Plan have been carried out. If at any time a large block of German reparation bonds were to be issued on the market it would inevitably reduce the amount of capital that could be attracted by other German securities, and the current reparation transfers would have to face an increased demand for foreign currencies to meet interest on and repayment of past borrowings without the relief hitherto pro-vided by fresh commercial borrowings. A &quot; liberation loan,&apos;&apos; raised to finance a final [15080] B 2
settlement of German obligations, might have so strong a sentimental support, both in Germany and among German-Americans, as to attract capital which would not normally go into German investments; but it is scarcely to be expected that a mere capitalisation of a small part of the German debt, in the interests of the Allies, would make a similar appeal, and its indirect effect on current transfers might be seriously detrimental.13. The above general arguments apply to any effort to realise at present the capital reparation debt, whether for the joint account of the Allies or in the interests of particular creditor Powers; but they apply, of course, with special force to any attempt on the part of individual Powers to realise independently their own share of the German debt to the detriment of all the other Allies. Their cumulative effect is to show that any commercialisation of the debt cannot be contemplated at present, or for some years to come, as a provident financial operation. The danger is that the pressure of domestic financial difficulties may blind some of the interested Powers to the financial disadvantages of such a proposal and they may wish to press the operation through without regard to the interests of the other Allies. This danger arises particularly as regards France and Belgium, who, in their anxiety to find extra-Budgetary resources with which to stabilise their francs, may be tempted to jump at offers made by second-rate American issuing houses, however, onerous the terms. In the opinion of the Treasury, His Majesty&apos;s Government should strongly discourage any such attempts. They would be most unlikely to be, in fact, successful. They are regrettable because they tend to divert the French Government from more sober schemes of stabilisation. If successful, they would amount to a quite unjustified further priority for Belgium and new priority for France in reparation payments.15. It may seem an invidious task for this country (which would be represented as not in urgent need of cash) to oppose attempts by France (however mistaken we may hold them to be) to meet her financial difficulties. This may seem even more the case if the German Government (who have nothing to lose by giving away other folks&apos; property) encourage such a policy in the hope that it would result either immediately or ultimately in an alleviation of the German liabilities. But it is very necessary in the wider interest, as well as in the special interests of this country, that these ideas should be discouraged;- and it should not in practice be difficult to secure this.(a.) The practical difficulties are so serious that it seems unlikely that the proposal to market the German bonds will come to anything; indeed, any such operation, if attempted, might well serve as a precedent for the United States of America to market the bonds representing inter-Allied debts, and the French susceptibility on this point may contribute to wean them from the idea of marketing German bonds.(b.) It may be taken as certain that Italy and the minor Powers interested in reparation would be violently hostile to preferential treatment for France.(c.) Without American co-operation any marketing would be impossible; and it seems highly improbable that the United States Government would allow German loan operations in New York for the benefit of France, until France has ratified her Debt Agreement with the United States Treasury.(d.) The Agent-General for Reparations and the Transfer Committee should clearly oppose the idea as likely to break the Dawes Plan.(e.) The consent, probably the unanimous consent, of the Reparation Commission would be required. At present, the German bonds are held by the Reparation Commission on behalf of all the Allied Powers, and none of the Allied Powers actually hold any bonds at all. If, therefore, any attempt were to be made by an individual Power to realise its share of such bonds, it would have in the first instance to approach the Reparation Commission and request it to distribute the bonds. At this stage the proposal could probably be blocked without much difficulty. Annex II, paragraph 13, to Part VIII of the Treaty of Versailles provides that the Reparation Commission has to be unanimous on &quot; questions of determining the amount and conditions of bonds and other obligations to be issued by the German Government and of fixing the time and manner of selling, negotiating or distributing such bonds.&quot; This provision is specifically directed to the original bonds which the German Government has to issue under paragraph 12 of the same Annex, and it may be
questioned whether, as a strict matter of law, it applies directly to the bonds issued under the Dawes Plan (though the French, who have always maintained that the Dawes Plan is merely a &quot;modality &quot;. of execution of Part VIII of the Treaty could scarcely take this line. But even if from the legal point of view the bonds issued under the Dawes Plan cannot be regarded as coming under paragraph 13, the insertion of this clause in the Treaty indicates that the Allied Powers recognised their common interest in all proposals for selling, negotiating and distributing bonds, and this principle would appear equitably to imply that any decision taken by the Reparation Commission with a view to &quot; selling, negotiating and distributing &quot; Railway bonds must be unanimous. Thus it is improbable that the Reparation Commission would decide to distribute the bonds to the creditor Powers or to sell them except by a unanimous decision. We could probably resist without difficulty any attempt by the French Government to obtain the distribution of the bonds, with a view to selling a block for the sole benefit of France; as such a proposal would be opposed by all the other Allies. It is not certain that the other Allies would be equally unfavourable to a proposal to realise a block of the bonds for the joint account of the Allies; but any such proposal could probably be disposed of on practical grounds. It must be remembered that the American citizen has to take part in any decision &quot;relating to the Dawes Plan,&quot; and he evidently would take part in any decision relating to the distribution or sale of bonds. It is most improbable that the Reparation Commission would attempt either to distribute or to sell such bonds against the votes either of the British or American members, as the only object of any distribution would be to facilitate the marketing of the bonds. The success of any such proposal would depend primarily on the views of the British and American markets, which would naturally be influenced by the attitude of the British and American representatives at the Reparation Commission. Moreover, it is most improbable that the United States State Department would permit any sale of reparation bonds in order to finance France, until the French Debt Agreement had been ratified by the Chamber, and once that agreement has been ratified, the French Government would probably be able to raise a loan on the United States market, backed by their own credit, on terms at least as favourable as could be obtained for the German bonds. Possibly the French Government might find it useful to pledge, as collateral, their receipts from the undistributed German bonds; and to this, of course, we should have no objection.16. From the British point of view, the main considerations to be kept in mind are : (a.) Flis Majesty&apos;s Government could not agree to any distribution by the Reparation Commission of the German bonds to the Allied Powers, with a view to their attempting to market their individual shares and thus damaging the security of the other creditors.(6.) Any sale must therefore be made on joint account, on terms approved by all the Allied Powers interested. So far as we are concerned, we should not be willing to approve any realisation which, either by reason of the heavy discount or the priority of exchange required to satisfy the lenders, appears to us disadvantageous as compared with our existing anticipated receipts from the annuities (except, of course, as part of a general reconsideration, including our own debts to United States of America). We are satisfied that the requisite conditions cannot be fulfilled at present.(c.) In any event, if and when the moment came, we should have to restrict the amount raised in Great Britain to take account of our own capital requirements. We could (assuming the conditions fulfilled) agree with-out difficulty to the issue in London of a share of the loan not exceeding the British Empire share in the proceeds realised. But in view of the investment position here, as well as in the interests of our exchange, we should have to limit the amount, if any, that could be placed in the London market for account of the Allies very narrowly. We should certainly aim at making good any.amount raised here for the Allies by [15080] b 3
an equivalent payment to ourselves out of any sums realised by a market issue in New York; and we could not in any case allow any sum to be raised here destined for France until France had ratified her debt agree-ment with this country.II (a). Repurchase by Germany of the Saar Mines.17. Under the Treaty of Versailles (Articles 45 to 50) the coal-mines situated in the Saar Basin were transferred to France in full and absolute possession &apos;&apos; as compensation for the destruction of the coal-mines in the North of France and as part payment towards the total reparation due from Germany.&quot; The value of the property thus ceded was to be determined by the Reparation Commission, debited to France and credited to Germany on reparation account. The Treaty further provided that the territory was to. be provisionally administered by the League of Nations for fifteen years; at the end of this period (i.e., in 1935) the inhabitants Were to decide by plebiscite between the alternatives of (a) maintenance of the pro-yisiopal regime under the League; (b) union with France; and (c) union with Germany. If the plebiscite decided in favour of union with Germany, France&apos;s rights of ownership in the mines were to be repurchased by Germany at a price payable in gold. The price to be paid was to be fixed by three experts a Frenchman, a German and a member of another nationality deciding by majority. &quot; The obligations on Germany to make such payments shall be taken into account by the Reparation Commission, and, for the purpose of this payment, Germany may create a prior charge upon her assets or revenues upon such detailed terms as shall be agreed to bythe Reparation Commission.....   France and Germany may, by special agree-ments concluded before the time fixed for the payment of the price for the repurchase of the mines, modify the provisions of paragraphs 36 and 37.&quot; (Chapter III, paragraphs 36 to 38, of the Annex to Article 50 of the Treaty.)18. The Reparation Commission have not yet determined the value of the mines. By Article 9 of the Agreement pf the 11th March, 1922, France was debited with a lump sum of  15 millions in respect of the mines, and it was agreed that any valuation in excess of this figure should be disregarded for the purpose of inter-A Hied accounts. Before the adoption of the Dawes Plan, the German experts contended that the value of the mines was  50 millions, and the French that it was only  14-^ millions. The Finance Service of the Reparation Commission recommended a figure of about  18 millions, while the British Delegation considered that the value should be  24 millions. After the adoption of the Dawes plan, the German Govern-ment completely changed their point of view. The amount of the valuation was no longer of any practical importance to them as regards their reparation liabilities, while they hoped to repurchase, the mines in 1935, and a low valuation by the Reparation Commission would presumably assist them in effecting the repurchase at a low price. It was generally felt that the only satisfactory solution would be for the Reparation Commission to obtain the advice of an independent expert, but the matter has been left in abeyance, as there is no particular urgency to settle the question.19. On the assumption that the inhabitants will vote for union with Germany in 1935, the German Government will, in. any case, have to purchase the mines in that year, and it is clear that an agreement between France and Germany that the mines should be repurchased without waiting till 1935 offers considerable attractions to both parties. It is, however, equally clear that such an agreement might be disadvantageous to the other Powers entitled to reparation.. Germany would no doubt claim that the payment for the mines should be comprised within the Dawes annuities on the ground that the repurchase is a Treaty payment. The Allies would oppose to this the argument that the repurchase of the mines is nothing more than a commercial transaction on a.large scale, and that Germany would thereby obtain an asset equivalent in value to the price she pays. The matter would fall to be decided by the Interpretation Tribunal under the London Agreement. It is regarded as probable that the Germans would lose their case, but of this there can be no certainty. If any agreement is concluded between the French and German Governments, it should be a condition that the Germans agree to make no claim that the payments for the repurchase of the mines are comprised within the Dawes annuities.20. But even if the German Government agreed that the purchase money for the Saar had to be paid in addition to the Dawes annuities, the transaction might still be detrimental to the interests of the other Powers entitled to reparation. Any large foreign payments made by Germany necessarily tend to reduce Germany&apos;s
&apos; ................. &quot;    &apos;y-y:y?yyr;yy&apos;^:yryyi:r-yr-yy-^^y?^mmz,mA&amp;capacity to transfer reparation payments to the Allies as a whole. For this reason, Article 248 of the Treaty provided that reparations should constitute a first charge on all German assets, and gave the Reparation Commission the duty of deciding whether, in any given case, they would admit an exception to this first charge. The Article was very difficult to carry into effect as the German Government constantly disputed the interpretation placed upon it by the Reparation Commission and the Treaty provided no machinery for settling such disputes. The Dawes Plan trans-ferred the resonsibility for the transfer of German payments from the Reparation Commission to the Transfer Committee and the Reparation Commission then declared that &quot; while maintaining the legal point of view that the adoption of the Report does not affect the rights which the Commission holds under Article 248, in practice the Commission did not intend to exercise such rights in respect of any of the properties or revenues other than those specially designated as security for the annuities&quot; [i.e., customs and other taxes], &quot; in so far as the assigned receipts are sufficient to ensure the payments provided for in the Report; the Commission, more-over, has no intention of intervening in payments to be made outside Germany except in so far as it may be necessary to protect the German exchange.&quot; At the same time, it was arranged with the German Government that the Transfer Committee should be notified of all foreign payments which Germany intended to make, so that they could express their views on the effect of such payment on the exchange. This arrangement presumably gives the Transfer Committee the right to be consulted before any actual payment is made by Germany in respect of the Saar.21. The attitude of the Transfer Committee to such a proposal is difficult to forecast. The Committee consists of a number of Bankers of Allied or American nationality, under the Chairmanship of Mr. Parker Gilbert, the Agent-General for Reparation Payments. Their duty is to control reparation transfers with due regard to the stability of the German exchange, but they are not technically appointed by or responsible to the Allied Governments, and it may be doubtful whether they have any power to veto any foreign payment by Germany so long as the Dawes obligations are fulfilled. The Committee could scarcely regard a cash payment by Germany of  12-1 millions (the figure now suggested for the Saar) as not likely to affect reparation transfers; but on the other hand, the special Treaty provision by which the Reparation Commission is to take account of the obligations of Germany in this matter may be held to imply that they should give the proposal sympathetic consideration which they may be disposed to do, with a view to facilitating the settlement of a troublesome international dispute. Moreover, if the German Government were able to effect the payment by raising a loan for the purpose in the United States, the immediate effect on the Exchange could not be sufficiently serious to justify the Committee in opposing the scheme, on technical transfer grounds, particularly as the Saar mines would constitute a valuable economic asset for Germany in future and would increase her export and diminish her import of coal.22. But, whatever view the Transfer Committee took, the proposal, involving, as it does, a substantial modification of the Treaty procedure and an anticipation of the repurchase of the mines by Germany, would presumably require the previous consent of the other Allied Powers interested in reparations; and it is practically certain that at some stage or another it would be referred to those Governments. They might well assert that in equity France should not claim that the German debt for the mines should be liquidated more promptly than the reparation debt, and that the purchase money should accordingly be paid in instalments on the same basis and over the same period as the Dawes Annuities. But if, in fact, the German Govern-ment were to raise a loan for the purpose, the French Government might reply that, so far as the charge on Germany is concerned, the payment will in effect be spread over a long period, and that the other Powers are not thereby damnified. Taken as a special case, it might be difficult for Flis Majesty&apos;s Government and other Powers interested in reparations to raise objection; and the negotiation would probably resolve itself into an effort by these Powers to secure for themselves some similar special arrangement on matters that interested them, as the price of their agreement. Whether a  12^ million loan for such a payment could be raised in the United States of America is another matter.II (b). Repurchase by Germany of Etipen-Malmedy, and of Mark Notes issued in belgium.23. Under Article 34 of the Treaty, Germany renounced all rights and title over Eupen-Malmedy in favour of Belgium. The Belgian Government recently considered a proposal to restore this small territory, which is of no particular value to them, to Germany in return for a cash payment
of about  10 millions to assist in the stabilisation of the Belgian franc. M. Poincare, however, vetoed the idea, and it was temporarily dropped. Such an arrangement does not raise the same complications as the repurchase of the Saar mines from Prance. It is quite clear that any payment made by Germany for Eupen-Malmedy would not be a Treaty payment, and that the Germans could not put forward any claim for it to be comprised within the Dawes annuities. But any such payment to Belgium would reduce Germany&apos;s capacity to transfer reparations and would presumably at some stage be submitted to the Transfer Committee or to the Powers interested in reparations. The Allies could fairly oppose a large payment being made to Belgium, nominally by Germany, but in fact at the expense of Germany&apos;s reparation creditors. Belgium has already received a priority of  100 millions of reparations, which is only just extinguished, and she cannot justify a new priority. If, however, the payments were not unduly large and could be financed by-means of a German loan, it might be difficult to maintain that the arrangements would necessarily prejudice the other Powers entitled to reparation, and the danger of any such prejudice might be outweighed by the desirability of effecting a settlement of the question on common-sense lines from the point of view of general policy.24. It is believed, however, that the bargain under discussion also covered the question of the repurchase by Germany of the mark notes put into circulation during the German occupation. This is an old trouble. When the Belgian Government re-entered their country after the Armistice they found some b\ milliard paper marks (nominally  275millions) which were circulating in the country, the German Govern-ment having forced their acceptance at the pre-war rate of 1-25 francs to the mark. The Belgian Government decided of their own volition to exchange these marks, held by their citizens, into francs at this rate of 1-25 francs to the mark, and, as they allowed a month before the operation, not unnaturally a large quantity of marks (estimated at 600 million marks, or nominally  30 millions) was fraudulently intro-duced into the country in order to benefit by the exchange. The Belgian Delegation at the Peace Conference made vigorous efforts to obtain a clause in the Treaty to make the redemption of these marks a charge upon Germany, but they failed, as did the Roumanians, who put forward a similar claim. It was pointed out that the marks circulating in the various occupied territories represented in themselves a current value, and there was no obligation on the part of the Belgian or other Governments concerned to convert such notes. Notwithstanding the refusal of the Peace Conference to entertain this claim, the Belgians have repeatedly attempted to arrive at a side-agreement with the Germans for a special payment on this account spread over a long period offering in return to restore the German properties sequestrated in Belgium. This arrangement would have benefited both Belgium (which would have received payment for the marks) and Germany (which would have been relieved of the liability to compensate German owners of property in Belgium) at the expense of the Allies generally, since Belgium has to account to the Reparation Pool for any surplus of German properties which she liquidates. In January 1922, during the Cannes Conference, Sir R, Plorne informed M. Theunis that His Majesty&apos;s Government would not raise any objection, from the point of view of British interests, to the acceptance by the Reparation Commission of such an agreement. The negotiations were, however, abandoned after the murder of Dr. Rathenau and conditions have been substantially changed by the Dawes Plan. If Belgium were to succeed in negotiating a fresh agreement whereby Germany would make to her a cash payment in respect of these marks, it is clear that such a payment would not be a Treaty charge and that Germany could not claim that it should be comprised within the Dawes annuities. The Transfer Committee, however, might object to such payments as diminishing Germany&apos;s capacity to transfer reparation to the other Allies, and the Allies generally, having repeatedly refused to admit Belgium&apos;s claim to any special payment from Germany on this account, would certainly be entitled to object to such a payment being made, if it, in fact, had the effect of reducing the reparation transferred from Germany generally.25. Either the Saar or the Eupen-Malmedy proposal, taken in isolation, would have much to recommend it and each might be financed in such a way as to render difficult any veto on financial grounds. Taken together, however, they would involve a special payment of some  25 or  30 millions to France and Belgium in priority to the payment of reparations in which all the Allied Powers are interested, and it cannot be doubted that a payment on this scale would impede to some extent the successful development of the Dawes Plan. The proposal, viewed as a whole, indicates a movement to abandon the Treaty principle of joint reparations in favour of special bargains for different Powers, and it might well lead to a general scramble for such financial concessions as Germany is prepared to make to each of the Allies.   That
the French Government, which is entitled to more than 52 per cent, of all reparation payments, should take the lead in such a movement indicates a curious indifference to this danger.26. Assuming that on political and economic grounds, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have no reason to oppose these transactions and that the German Government do not claim that the payments should come out of the Dawes Annuities, the proposals give rise to far less objection, on financial grounds, than any attempt to market Reparation Bonds in so far as the amounts involved though considerable  are manageable. Our attitude would, therefore, depend to a considerable extent on the method of finance proposed. We should certainly oppose any considerable cash payments by Germany before it has been conclusively&apos; shown that she could reach the full Dawes scale or even maintain, unaided by foreign loans, the present scale of Dawes payments. But, if the German Government were able to raise loans in America for this purpose, we could not have strong grounds for opposing the scheme by reason of its effect on reparation transfers. Much will, therefore, depend on the question whether the United States Government would permit the issue of loans, in favour of France and Belgium, in advance of the ratification by France of the debt settlements. It should not be assumed that the loan could not be so dressed up as to appear a purely German interest and accordingly escape the veto on French loans; but it is more probable that the United States Government will insist on the prior ratification of the French debt agreement and His Majesty&apos;s Government should, of course, make the same stipulation as a condition of their assent to any such plans.27. There is little doubt that, one way or another, such plans will at any rate tend to prejudice the transfer of reparations, and it will be bitterly opposed by Italy, Serbia and the Minor Allies. The extent to which His Majesty&apos;s Government should lend support to such opposition will depend on the political importance attached to the development of Franco-Belgian-German relations. The Treasury, while having much sympathy with Belgium in her present financial difficulties, considers that the case for accepting the Eupen-Malmedy sale is less strong than the case for the sale by France of the Saar mines, and it would help to avoid a general scramble with serious effect on the stability of the Dawes Plan if the two proposals could be detached and treated separately.28. It is suggested, therefore, that the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government should be (a) To oppose any proposal involving a charge on the Dawes Annuities, in favour of France or Belgium, and to the detriment of the joint reparation account;(b.) To oppose any proposal which involves a heavy cash transfer by Germany, i.e., to insist that any repurchase should be financed by a loan raised in the United States of America;(c.) If the proposal were so drawn that opposition is not necessary on either of the above grounds, we should indicate to France that we feel dubious about any proposal involving further special payments to Belgium, but that we should be prepared to consider the purchase by Germany of the Saar Mines if the latter scheme can be treated in isolation;(d.) As a condition of our assent, we should stipulate that France should ratify the debt agreement without delay; and that she should support us in securing that no further special arrangements are made with Germany by other Powers;(e.) We should, if possible, secure French agreement on some minor financial points which have been the subject of lengthy discussion by the Reparation Commission. The most important of these is the reduction of the French prior charge for Armies of Occupation; but it is assumed that Germany will have succeeded in securing the immediate evacuation of the occupied territory as a condition of her acceptance of the scheme, and, if so, this question will have been settled. The French should then drop some small claims to other prior payments out of the Dawes Annuities for pensions and social insurance funds in Alsace-Lorraine. It would be of more interest to us to secure that the excess proceeds of liquidation of German properties are not accounted for to the Reparation Commission as cash, but merely debited to us against the capital repara-tion debt; and this question should be brought up if there is a suitable opportunity.Treasury Chambers,September 27, 1926.
