10 Dovvnine1 Street,Whitehall, S.YM.17th September, 12S.5.The Secretary,Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain.Sir,On the 3rd September you wrote to ue that you desired a, oonferenoe with the coalownors in the presence 9t represents&apos;tx?os of the Government, in order to seek a settlement of the present dispute; and you stated that you were prepared to enter into a discussion -an the basis of a &quot;reduction in labour oosts to nieot the insatiate ns&amp;de of the industry&quot;.   After full consideration wo decided that this offer constituted a basis auffioient to enable us to approach the Mining Association and to invite them to attend such a oonferenoe aa you desired.   But the Mining Association have now declined in the most emphatic manner to enter Into any dis-cussion with your Federation on the subjeot of hours and wages, or to make a National Agreement with them.    It Is evidently not within the power of Eie Majesty&apos;a Government to &quot;bring about a conference^ However, the Mining Association have SeGlared that the ooalowaexs in all districts are willing to observe the main principles that a National Agreement would be dasigned to seoursa   A satisfactory settlement should combine district arrangements with national supervision.    If the miners are at length ready to faot the economic facts of the industry and re-start work on provisional distriot settlements, His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to secure by legislation that these prinoiplos are properly applied by means of a National &amp;ppeal Tribunal.    We therefore lay before you in broad outline in the enclosed memorandum what wo are prepared to do and  the limits within whioh we find ourselves able to act.    If your members are prepared to resume work on the basis of distriot settlements subjeot to the security afforded-by these conditions, and when work has bsen generally resumed, we shall submit these proposals to Parliament in the form of a Bill,
We feel it necessary, however, to say that thia o fer ha a. been made by us out of a ainoera&apos; dasire to arrive at an early-settlement, and the Got-^thb. ant wilt naturally expect to reoeive the vlewo of. your jfeeesAt-i^io without delay. &apos;Yours faithfully, fSignea) STlSlBr B^fflH.
A Hi U   X E.I,     As soon as there has boon a general resumption of work through provisional settlements arrived at by local negotiations the Government will pass an Act of Parliament setting Up a National Arbitration Tribunal, unless the earlier conclusion of a national agreement renders it unnecessary,2,     Either party to any provisional settlement which provides for working more than the old hours may refer to the Tribunal for review any matter dealt with by such settlement being a matter of a kind which up to July 1925 was customarily dealt with by national settlements.So     The Tribunal shall confirm or modify a provisional settlement in respect of the matter referred to it and as from the date fixed by the Tribunal every man affected by the award and employed in any pit which works more than the old hours will be entitled by law to receive wages in accordance with the decision.10. Downing Street, S,W,10 September 17th, 1926,
