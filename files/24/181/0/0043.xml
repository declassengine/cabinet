[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. 1Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1926.SJEQRKT.CP. 343 (26)CIRCULATED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.o.Recruitment for the Indian Civil Service.The results of the recent Open Competition for the Indian Civil Service, which I have just received, are, I think, of sufficient interest to justify me in bringing them to the notice of my colleagues. When the Government came into power two years ago I found, on going to the India Office, that, so far at any rate as European candidates were concerned, recruitment for the Indian Civil Service had come almost to a standstill. For the four years 1921 to 1924 an annual average of five British candidates only had been appointed to the Service ; while both at Public Schools and Universities an attitude of indifference, if, not of definite hostility, had grown up towards service in India. The situation was, in my judgment, rendered more serious by the fact that this drying-up of the sources of recruitment came at a time when, in the first place, the Service was being drained of men, in many cases of high ability and great experience, who, as a result of the Reforms, had elected to retire prematurely, while, ou the other hand, the uneasy political situation in India and the difficulties inseparable from a period of transition made it mor-e than ever essential that an adequate supply of trained administrators of the highest intellectual quality and the highest character should be available to carry on the machinery of Government.On reviewing the situation with which I found myself faced I formed the conclusion that, relatively unimportant as the question of recruitment might to the outside observer appear to be, it was the most serious in the whole Indian political situation. The enquiries which I caused to be made on the subject indicated that the causes of the falling off of recruitment were principally (a) economic and (6) mis-apprehension as to the results and the extent of the Reforms. The economic difficulties it was possible to deal with satisfactorily by the acceptance of the recommendations of the Lee Commission on the Superior Civil Services, and these were accordingly implemented with the minimum of delay possible in the circumstances. The second difficulty was more serious in character, and I conceived it desirable to address myself to it personally by representations to University authorities in this country and by a series of visits to educational centres and institutions, by myself, or, under arrangements made by me, by representatives of the Indian Services and of the business communities iu India. This campaign has been actively pursued since the beginning of 1925, and I am glad to say that the results of the Open Competition which has just taken place for the Indian Civil Service appear to indicate that it has borne fruit, and that the misconceptions previously existing as to the character and nature of the work awaiting the administrator in India, and as to the intention of Government to maintain a fixed proportion of European administrators of first-class quality, and to secure them both politically and economically from the control of or interference by Indian Legislative bodies, have been, it would seem,-almost entirely removed.Figures, however, speak for themselves and they are as follows. In the years 1921-4 the average number of British candidates appointed annually to the Indian Civil Service was five. In 1925, when the propaganda campaign to which I have referred above had been in progress for six months, the total entry for the Service was 132, approximately half of whom were Europeans, and on the results of the examination I found it possible to appoint 21 Europeans and 15 Indians to the Service. The calibre of these candidates was good, their intellectual quality did not fall below the standard set in the years before the war; they came from good&apos; colleges, and, on the whole, from good schools. The proportion of Indian successes remained, however, embarrassingly large. The results of the examination which has just been held appear to indicate that the corner has now been turned : 183 candi-dates [pi whom over 90 were European), as compared with 132 last year, competed. The preliminary list of 35 successful candidates which has been published consists of 30 Europeans and 5 Indians, and in the first 55 candidates for the Indian Civil Service, beyond which point I do not propose to make any appointments. 44 are 1189      100   10.26
Europeans and 11 only Indians. This very satisfactory result will enable me to bill the European vacancies in the cadre of the Indian Civil Service, and I am glad to sav that it will be possible to do this consistently with the maintenance at a very high level of the intellectual standard which, as disclosed by the University records of these candidates, is definitely above the pre-war level. As an illustration of this I may mention that the candidate who stood 18th on the list for the Indian Civil Service has just been elected to a Fellowship at Oxford, while the 55th candidate on the list, a Cambridge undergraduate, was a scholar of his College with a first-class in both parts of the Classical Tripos.While the improvement in the recruitment situation of which I have given details above must be ascribed in a very large degree to the steps taken to dispel tho misgivings and misunderstandings prevalent at schools and Universities as to the opportunities offered by service in India, an important factor has also been the marked improvement in the contentment, and in the general- attitude, of members of the Indian Services. No steps which individual Ministers may take can maintain an inflow of candidates of the required calibre if reports of a disquieting character as to conditions and prospects are received from officers serving in India, and not the least satisfactory feature of the result of this year&apos;s competition is the evidence it affords of the general contentment with the present, conditions of the Indian Services.But the improvement ,rin recruitment and the improvement in the general attitude of the Services are equally based on certain definite assumptions, to the correctness of which I regard myself as personally committed, and which 1 take this opportunity to bring formally to the notice of my colleagues. These assumptions are that throughout their careers, the officers appointed by the Secretary of State lor India in Council on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government as the agents of Parliament in India, may rely on His Majesty&apos;s Government to safeguard them as regards both the security of their tenure and the maintenance of the prospects on the strength of which they elected to serve in India, that save with their own consent they will not at any time be transferred to the ultimate control of any authority subordinate to the Secretary of State for India as representing His Majesty&apos;s Government, and that in the event of any modification in the Indian political situation of a character such as to constitute a radical alteration in the terms and conditions of service on which they undertook to serve in India, such steps as may be necessary will be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government to secure that their interests are adequately safeguarded.BIRKENHEAD.9th October 1926.
