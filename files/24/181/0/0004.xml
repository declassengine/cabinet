The objectof this Report was to obtain(l) The general approval of Ministers for a memorandum containing proposals for completing the resolutions adopted by the Imperial Conference in 1923 by making clear the manner in which the various parts of tiie Empire should participate in the conclusion of treaties;    and(2) A decision on certain incidental points on which, as indicated in the memorandum, there was a divergence of opinion between the representatives of the  Foreign Office and the Dominions Office on the Committee.2. The Committee invited a Sub-Committee composed of -The Lord Priv^ Seal The Lord chancellor the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs to examine the questions on which divergencies of opinionexisted between the two Departments,  and to make recommend-at ions thereon direct to the Cabinet.

[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Governments] -Printed for the Imperial Conference.   July 1926SECRET. --3E. FJ+IMPERIAL CONFERENCE, 1926.3ifFORM OF PREAMBLE AND SIGNATURE OF TREATIES.THE Resolution of the Imperial Conference of 1923 has laid down an agreed method of procedure as regards the negotiation, signature and ratification of treaties.* Experience has since shown that these resolutions, while satisfactory as far as they go, do not cover the whole ground nor provide a solution for all the difficulties which arise. It is hoped therefore that it may be possible at the forth-coming Imperial Conference to supplement this Resolution by further resolutions dealing with difficulties, particularly in regard to the form of preamble and signature, to which experience has called attention, and the following suggestions are made with this end.   It is proposed to consider the subject under three heads : Present Form of Preamble and Signature.1. League treaties are regularly made in the form adojDted in the Peace Treaties, i.e., they begin with a list of the names of the contracting parties, followed by the recitals of the preamble and the list of the Heads of States and the plenipotentiaries appointed by them. A specimen of the form at present employed, so far as the various parts of the British Empire are concerned, as regards the preamble and signature is shown in Annex I.Description of Contracting Party.2. Adherence to the wording of the Annex to the Covenantf for the purpose of describing the contracting party leads to the absence of any mention of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of the Colonies and Protectorates in the preamble. The position as regards those parts of the Empire is therefore obscure. From the point of view of the Dominions and India, owing to there being no mention of Great Britain, there is a risk of uncertainty as to their own position and a suggestion that they are not on a footing of equality with Great Britain as participants in the treaties in question.It may be well to add that in this memorandum the term &quot; Great Britain &quot; is for the sake of brevity frequently used alone, but it is intended in all cases to include Northern Ireland; For treaty-making purposes some phrase is required which should be understood universally to include Great Britain and Northern Ireland as well as the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. Until a decision has been taken as to what phrase is to be adopted, the term Great Britain is retained in this memorandum for convenience. It is to be understood as including Northern Ireland if that territory is not specifically mentioned.* The word &quot; treaty&quot; is here used in the wide serse as covering&apos; any international agreement in conventional form other tlmn Governmental agreements, which are dealt with in Section III. t This wording: is as follows :  &quot; Original Members of the League of Nations  &quot; British Empire  &quot; Canada. &quot; Australia, &amp;c. &quot; China.&quot;I II III-League Treaties. -Non-League Treaties. -Governmental Agreements.I. League Treaties.
Similarly for the sake of brevity the phrase &apos;&apos; the Dominions &quot; is sometimes used without mention of India, but it is intended in all cases to include India, even though not mentioned.3. Whatever changes are made, the form adopted should comply with two requirements : (1) it should preserve the principle of the unity of the Empire, i.e., indicate that &quot;the British Empire&quot; is something which includes and is made up of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Colonies, &amp;c, as well as the Dominions^ and India; (2) it should not imply any want of equality between Great Britain, the Dominions and India as participants in the treaties in question. With these objects in view, it is suggested that in future the contracting party should, in cases where the treaty is signed on behalf of all parts of the Empire, be described in the list at the beginning of the treaty as &quot;the British Empire,&quot; followed in brackets by the words &quot; Great Britain and Northern Ireland and all parts of the Empire which are not separate members of the League, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the Irish Free State and India.&quot;4. This form would only require slight modifications in cases where the treaty is not signed on behalf of all parts of the Empire. In all cases where it is signed on behalf of more than one part of the Empire, which is a member of the League, the formula would be as shown above, only omitting within the brackets those parts of the Empire which do not sign. In cases where the treaty is signed on behalf of Great Britain and not on behalf of the Colonies, &amp;o, the phrase &quot;and all parts of the Empire which are not separate members of the League &quot; would be omitted. Cases where the treaty is signed only on behalf of one part of the Empire which is a separate member of the League should be divided into those in which the terms of the treaty give liberty to members of the League to sign subsequently up to a given date and those in which they do not. In the first case the words &quot;the British Empire&quot; should be retained and the name of the signato^ part of the Empire placed within the bracket, so that in the event of another part of the Empire signing subsequently, its name can be added within the bracket. In the second case, the expression &quot;the British Empire &quot; should not be used, and the name of the signatory part of the Empire should be inserted in its position in the alphabetical order of the signatories. Forms showing the procedure in each of these various cases are appended in Annex II.*Description of Plenipotentiaries and Form of Signature.5. It will be seen from Annex I that ail the plenipotentiaries for the different parts of the British Empire are grouped together after the King, but that, whereas the name of the plenipotentiary appointed by the Government in London is not accompanied by any territorial description, the names of the plenipotentiaries for the Dominions and India are preceded by the name of the part of the Empire on behalf of which each is authorised to act.6. This arrangement reflects the present form of the full powers issued by His Majesty to the various plenipotentiaries. The form of full power issued to the plenipotentiaries acting on behalf of the London Government is unlimited, that is, it contains no limitation as to the part of the Empire for which they are authorised to sign. (Plenipotentiaries holding full powers in this form constitute what is sometimes known as the &quot; Central Panel.&quot;) The plenipotentiaries acting on behalf of the Dominions and India hold full powers authorising them to sign &quot; in respect of our Dominion of Canada,&quot; &amp;c. This procedure was adopted at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 and the Washington Disarmament Conference in 1921, and it was provided in the Resolution of the Imperial Conference of 1923, on the subject of the negotiation, signature and ratification of treaties, that, as regards treaties negotiated at International Conferences, the full powers should be in the form employed at Paris and Washington.7. As regards the form of signature, it is usual in the case of treaties negotiated under the auspices of. the League to print against the names of the signatory plenipotentiaries the names of the countries for which they sign. The present form of signature so far as the various parts of the British Empire are concerned is shown in the specimen given in Annex I.% Papua and Norfolk Island are regarded as being- covered by the term &quot; Australia.&quot; For the position of mandated territories, see paragraph 9.* The examples of forms for the list of States in the preamble to League treaties quoted in Annex II do not exhaust all possible cases, e.g., there might be a convention similar to that negotiated at the First Opium Conference at Geneva in 1924-5, which by its terms applied only to India and certain Eastern Colonies, &amp;c. It does not seem necessary to determine in advance what modifications (if any) in the suggested forms would be required; it would seem sufficient to leave such special cases to be dealt with as they arise in accordance with the general principles here laid clown.
8. The effect of the form of the full powers described above is that the signa-ture of the &quot;Central Panel&quot; plenipotentiaries is of such a nature as, in the absence of any qualifying declaration, to bind the whole Empire, while the signature of each Dominion plenipotentiary only binds the Dominion which he repre-sents. In order to prevent the signature of &quot; Central Panel&quot; plenipotentiaries resulting in any Dominion being made a party &quot;to a League Treaty without its Government signifying its acceptance of the treaty by the signature of its own plenipotentiaries and binding itself by their signatures, a procedure is followed by which &quot; Central Panel &quot; plenipotentiaries formally append to their signatures a declaration excluding from the operation of those signatures any Dominion which, being a separate Member of the League, does not by separate signature or accession become a party to the Treaty. The net result is that any Dominion whose Plenipotentiaire-tentiaries sign a League Treaty is technically covered by two separate sets of signatures, viz., those of its own plenipotentiaries and those of the &quot; Central Panel &quot; plenipotentiaries. Similarly, if a Dominion accedes, the accession extends pro tanto the operation of the signatures of the Central Panel plenipotentiaries.9. This system presents considerable advantages. From the point of view of foreign Powers the fact that so much of the Empire as accepts the treaty is covered by the signature of a single plenipotentiary renders it impossible to contend that it is not contracting as a unit or that two separate parts of the Empire which accept the treaty are, in relation to one other, separate contracting parties. From the point of view of the Empire it provides for&apos;the full operation of the principle that no Dominion is to be bound by a treaty without a signature or an act of accession for which its own Govevrnment is responsible. From the external point of view the present system gives formal expression to an essential principle governing the relationship between the various parts of the British Empire, whether self-governing or not, viz., that they stand in relation to one another in a position entirely different from that in which each stands in relation to foreign countries. If this were not the case, that is, if it could be held that parts of the Empire were separate contracting parties inter se in the same sense as each is a contracting party in relation to foreign countries, it would be impossible for a part of the Empire which was a party, for example, to a League Treaty guaranteeing equal treatment, to accord to another part of the Empire preferential treatment in respect of any of the matters covered by the treaty without at the same time extending that treatment to the foreign countries which were parties; further, if the treaty contained provision for the reference of disputes to the Permanent Court of International Justice, differences of opinion between two parts of the Empire, which were parties to the treaty, as to its application or interpretation would have to be referred to the Permanent Court. There would also be other reactions in the sphere of international relationships of the most far-reaching character; for example, there would be difficulty in maintaining that a commercial treaty granting most-favoured-nation treatment to a foreign country did not entitle that foreign country to any tariff concessions granted by one part of the Empire to another.10. If it is thought that the present procedure does not comply in form with, the accepted principle of full equality between the various parts of the Empire, which forms the basis of any discussion of questions of this kind, some alternative form must be found which will safeguard the principles indicated above. A possible alternative would seem to be a form of full power containing words of geographical limitation applying to each plenipotentiary, with corresponding geographical limitation against the name of each plenipotentiary both in the preamble and the list of signatures. Any new arrangements should, however, be applied as regards the full power, the preamble and the list of signatures in such a manner as to safeguard the principle indicated in paragraph 9.An appropriate form of preamble would appear to be on the following lines : All the plenipotentiaries for the different parts of the British Empire would then continue to be grouped together after the King as contracting party in the following manner with Avords of geographical limitation applying to each plenipotentiary : His Majesty the King, &amp;c,For Great Britain and Northern Ireland, &amp;e,A.B.For Canada,CD.&amp;c.
The form of signature would then follow the same principle, and would be as follows : British Empire Great Britain and Northern Ireland and all parts of the Empire which are not separate members of the League : A. B.Canada : C. D.Australia: E. F.&amp;c. -11. The objection to this course is that it does not Emphasize to the same extent as the present procedure the important principle described in paragraph 9, and that if it were adopted it would be difficult to maintain that principle in connection with Treaties.12. This objection, however, would to a great extent be overcome if all the Governments represented at the Imperial Conference definitely placed on record their view that the principle in question forms the basis of their international position, and communicated to the League, and, if necessary, to individual foreign Powers, an expression of their intention to maintain it in relation to treaties to which they become parties.Inter-Imperial Clause.13. Further formal expression of the principle described in paragraph 9 has in the past been given by a Clause in League Treaties which runs as follows : &quot;It is understood that this Convention/Statute must not be interpreted as regulating in any way rights and obligations inter se of territories forming part or placed under the protection of the same sovereign State, whether or not these territories are individually members of the League of Nations.&quot;This Article was originally inserted in the instruments signed at Barcelona in 1921; it has been inserted in some, but not all, of the League treaties signed since that date. The present position in this respect is unsatisfactory, first, because it is difficult to decide in each particular case whether the general interests of the British Empire require the insertion of the Clause or not, and, secondly, because there is always a risk of the insertion of the clause being opposed by foreign representatives, with the result that it may be impossible to secure its insertion, while its omission is always liable to give rise to a suggestion that the principle which it embodies is no longer upheld. The question was discussed at the Arms Traffic Conference in 1925, and the Legal Committee of that Conference laid it down that the principle which the Clause embodied underlies all international conventions. In these circumstances, the best course would seem to be to deal with the point specifically in any Resolution on the subject passed at the Imperial Conference, and not to attempt in any future case to secure the insertion of the Article. Where, as not infrequently happens, the Governments of different parts of the Empire are willing that certain provisions of a treaty should be applied between themselves as an administrative measure, they should be prepared to state the extent to which, and the terms on which, such provisions are to apply.Order of Precedence.*14. The order in which the British Empire plenipotentiaries appear in the preamble and sign should be the order of precedence adopted at the Imperial Conference, i.e., Great Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Irish Free State, India.Final Act, &amp;c.15. The Final Act of a League Conference is not a conventional instrument but merely a record of what has been done at the conference. At present the practice is that the signatures of the representatives of the different parts of the British Empire to the Final Act are not grouped together as in the case of signatures to a convention, but appear in the alphabetical order of members of the League under the names of the Dominions which they represent, the representatives appointed by the* This paragraph applies also to non-League treaties.
Government in London figuring under the name &quot;British Empire.&quot; No mention is made of Great Britain, and as Great Britain is not a member of the League it would be difficult in present circumstances to justify that designation in the Final Act. The logical solution for the present anomalous situation would be to adopt the formula proposed for the preamble of League treaties. No change would appear to be necessary in the existing practice as regards the order of seating, voting, &amp;c, at League Conferences. For these purposes the alphabetical order of the members of the League (including the Dominions and India) should be retained.Mandated Territories.16. There has in the past been some uncertainty as to the effect in relation to mandated territories of the signature of a League treaty on behalf of the different parts of the British Empire. It is suggested that for the future it should be laid down that the plenipotentiary representing &quot;Great Britain and all parts of the Empire which are not separate members of the League &quot; should be regarded as representing the mandated territories of Palestine (including Trans-Jordan), Tanganyika Territory, the Cameroons, Togoland and Nauru, and that his signature should bind them, and that similarly the plenipotentiary representing a Dominion should be regarded as representing any territories mandated to that Dominion and that his signature should bind them. The result will be that, in cases where it is not desired that a treat]&apos; should apply to a mandated territory, it will be necessary for the plenipotentiary concerned to make a declaration excluding such territory from his signature, unless the treaty excludes mandated territories or contains a &quot;colonial clause&quot; under which-mandated territories can be excluded at the time of ratification. As regards Irak, the signature of the plenipotentiary will not bind Irak unless he is authorised to sign hj the Irak Government. In that case Irak must appear separately in the list of contracting States and signatures.Ratification.&apos;*17. Where a treaty is ratified by means of an instrument which reproduces the text of the document as signed, there is no need to repeat in the ratification instru-ment any declaration made at the moment of signature and appearing in the text of the document, which excludes from the operation of the treaty any specific part of the Empire; but where the ratification is to apply only to part of the area for which the treat)&apos; was signed, the part to be excluded from the ratification must be specified in the instrument.Coming into Force of League Treaties.18. Practically all League treaties contain a ratification clause and a provision that the treaty will come into force on the deposit of a certain number of ratifications. The question has sometimes arisen whether, for the purpose of making up the number of ratifications necessary to bring a treaty into force, ratifications on behalf of different parts of the Empire which are separate members of the League should be counted as separate ratifications.t There has been a case recently where it was suggested that a treaty which only required two ratifications to bring it into force could come into force because ratifications had been deposited on behalf of the &quot;British Empire&quot; (excluding all the Dominions, none of whom were parties to the convention) and India. Constitutionally, there can be no doubt that ratification is the act of the King, and that, even though it may happen that separate ratifications have been deposited in His Majesty&apos;s name, this does not make the King more than one High Contracting Party for the purpose in question. Further, the opposite view is inconsistent with the principle that the various parts of the Empire stand in relation to one another in a position entirely different from that in which each stands in relation to foreign countries, and also with the proposal made in paragraph 14 as regards the &quot;Inter-Imperial Clause.&quot;* This paragraph applies also to non-League treaties which are of such a nature that any question of exclusion may arise.t Every ratification is a ratification by the King, and the qnestion whether, iu the case of a League treaty, one or more ratifications are deposited on behalf of His Majesty depends entirely on whether the different Governments of the Empire concerned are all ready to advise ratification at the same time. If they are, only one ratification would be deposited; if they are not, one ratification would be deposited on behalf of those which were, followed by separate ratifications on behalf of any which came in subsequently.
Proposed Joint Statement to League.19. If the recommendations contained in this part are adopted by the Imperial Conference it will be desirable that a joint statement should be made to the League explaining the practice which it is proposed to adopt in future.II. Non-League Treaties.\20. The negotiation of these treaties is governed by paragraph 1 (1) of the 1923 Resolution, under which every Government of the Empire which may be concerned is to be informed of the proposal to open negotiations and to have the opportunity of participating in the negotiations, should it desire to do so. This principle underlies all the recommendations which follow.It is proposed to consider these treaties under the following heads : (A.) Multilateral: (1.) Political. (2.) Technical.(B.) Bilateral: -(1.) Political.(2.) Technical and Commercial.(A.) Multilateral.(1.) Political.21. Except in the case of the Peace Treaties and certain instruments subsidiary thereto, the usual practice is that treaties of this description are made in the names of Heads of States, and accordingly do not (as in the case of League treaties) begin with a list of the contracting States. This is the more convenient practice and should be adopted so far as possible.22. Multilateral political treaties imposing active obligations on all parts of the Empire (e.g., the Treaty of Versailles and the Washington Naval Disarmament Treaty) should be signed by a plenipotentiary or plenipotentiaries on behalf of all the Governments concerned. Whether such signature is effected by a plenipotentiary or body of plenipotentiaries acting on behalf of all the Governments, or by pleni-potentiaries acting on behalf of each Government separately, is a matter which can be settled in each case as may be convenient, but there must be uniformity; if the treaty is signed separately on behalf of some Governments, it should be signed separately on behalf of all.A specimen of the form of preamble at present employed in the case of treaties signed separately on behalf of each Government is given in Annex III (A). If the procedure indicated in paragraphs 10 and 13 is adopted as regards League treaties, it would naturally be adopted in these cases also as regards the form of preamble &quot;and full powers. As regards signature, no question normally arises, as it is not the practice in such cases to print the names of the countries represented against the signatures.Should the treaty be signed by a plenipotentiary or body of plenipotentiaries on behalf of all the Governments their full powers should in any case be unlimited.23. The case of multilateral political treaties not imposing active obligations on all parts of the Empire is more complicated. Speaking generally, where active obligations have in the past been imposed at all under such treaties,, the obligations have been imposed on one part of the Empire only, viz., Great Britain. The treaties have, however, affected the whole Empire in that the fact of their conclusion on behalf of the King entails recognition by all parts of the Empire of the state of affairs arising from them, and particularly of any resulting changes in the position of British subjects generally. An instance of such a treaty is the Tangier Convention, which defined the status of the Tangier territory and set up a special form of government therein, and at the same time imposed active obligations on Great Britain only. The practice has been for such treaties to be signed on behalf of the King by one or more plenipoten-tiaries appointed on the advice of the London Government and holding unlimited full powers.*  No mention of any of the different parts of the Empire is made in the% In this section the word &quot; treaty &quot; is used to denote any international agreement in conventional form other than Governmental agreements, which are dealt with in Section III. * Seo Annex III (b) for the form of preamble used in such cases.
preamble, the active obligations it imposes being made clear in the text of the treaty. This practice has proved convenient, and its continuance is desirable, especially as it is hoped that the proposals to be made for improving the methods of inter-Imperial consultation in foreign affairs will facilitate the settlement of any points that may arise.24. Although in the past the active obligations under such treaties, so far as the British Empire is concerned, have rested with Great Britain, it by no means follows that this will always be the case in future. Thus, in the case of multilateral political treaties imposing active obligations on any part of the Empire, situations may arise (a.) in which active obligations will only fall upon a part of the Empire other than Great Britain;(5.) in which active obligations will fall on two or more parts of the Empire, oneof which may or may not be Great Britain; (c.) in which other parts of the Empire are for special reasons interested, eventhough they may have no active obligations.Further, in the case of multilateral political treaties not imposing active obligations on any part of the Empire, more than one part may be interested for special reasons in their conclusion.In all the above cases the whole Empire would be concerned in the sense explained above, i.e., to the extent of recognising the state of affairs arising from the treaty.It does not seem desirable to attempt to lay down rules designed to cover every conceivable case, and it would appear that it should be possible, without difficulty, to adapt the proposals made in this memorandum as regards the form of full powers and preamble to meet such cases as arise. The criterion as regards separate signature should be whether or not any part of the Empire has an active obligation, in which case the treaty should be signed on its behalf, or such practical interest that it may desire separate signature on its behalf.(2.) Technical.25. These are generally made in the names of Heads of States, and this is the more convenient practice. Such treaties differ from political treaties in that they may well be, and often are, signed on behalf of parts only of the British Empire. It is therefore important that the preamble and text of the treaty should make plain the parts of the Empire to which it applies.26. Where such a treaty is to apply to Great Britain or to any of the Dominions it should be signed by separate plenipotentiaries on their behalf. If the procedure indicated in paragraphs 10 and 13 is adopted as regards League treaties it would naturally be adopted in these cases as regards the form of preamble and full powers and also as regards the list of signatures (if the names of the countries signed for are printed alongside of the signatures).A special feature of multilateral technical treaties is that (unlike multilateral political treaties) they often make provision by which portions of the territory of the contracting parties( viz., Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories) are not included unless by subsequent accession. Where such provision is not made, any necessary excluding declarations should be made by the plenipotentiaries of Great Britain and the Dominions in regard to the territories with which they are respectively concerned at the time of signature.The parts of the Empire to wdiich a multilateral technical party is to apply will accordingly be shown -(1.) by the list of plenipotentiaries in the preamble; (2.) by any excluding declarations made at the time of signature; (3.) by the form of the Colonial exclusion clause, if any, and by any action taken thereunder;(4.) in some cases by the text of the treaty itself.27. In cases where the treaty begins with a list of the names of the contracting States, the position will be much the same as in the case of League treaties, and the forms adopted for use in the preamble of such treaties should be used (see paragraphs 3, 4 and 10, and Annex II).
(B.)   Bilateral.(1.) Political.28. The regular practice is to make such treaties in the names of the Heads o v. States. The great majority of such treaties can without difficulty be placed within one or other of the classes into which multilateral political treaties are divided in paragraphs 23, 24 and 25, and the recommendations made in those paragraphs as regards the form of full powers, preamble and signature are respectively applicable.In cases where the obligations of the treaty are expressly confined to one part of the Empire only, the recommendations in paragraph 2 (a) of the 1923 Resolutions are applicable.*&apos; The form of preamble used in a treaty whose application is confined to one Dominion only is given in Annex IV.(2.) Technical and Commercial.29.   Such treaties are regularly made in the names of Heads of States.   Para- . graphs 2 (a) and 2 (b) of the 1923 Resolution are applicable to such treaties,* and any further questions arising should be dealt with in accordance with the principles referred to in paragraphs 23, 24 and 25.It is usual to define the scope of such treaties either (a) by specifying nominatim in the text of the treaty the part or parts of the Empire included, or (b) by inserting an &quot; exclusion and accession clause.&quot; Sometimes a combination of both methods is employed.The form of preamble given in Annex IV is suitable for use in the case of a bilateral technical or commercial treaty applicable to one Dominion only.III. Governmental A agreements.30. These are dealt with in Section II of the 1923 Resolution, and no difficulties arise in relation thereto. Where such agreements are multilateral, the names of the contracting Governments will appear in alphabetical order, and, where several Governments of the Empire are parties to such an agreement, there is no need to group them together either in the preamble or in the signatures.The principle laid down in the latter part of paragraph 14 applies to these inter-governmental agreements.* Paragraphs 2 (a) and 2 (i) of the 1923 Resolution are as follows: &quot; (a.) Bilateral treaties imposing obligations on one part of the Empire only should be signed by a representative of the Government of that part. The Full Power issued to such representative should indicate the part of the Empire in respect of which the obligations are to be undertaken, and the preamble and text of the treaty should be so worded as to make its scope clear.&quot; (J.) Where a bilateral treaty imposes obligations on more than one part of the Empire, the treaty should be signed by one or more plenipotentiaries on behalf of all the Governments concerned.&quot;
