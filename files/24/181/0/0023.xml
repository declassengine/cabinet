IRON AND &amp;TEEL.From MR . DOR MAN tThe number of Blest Furnaces In operation at the end of July has been reduced to ti, a reduction of 3 on those in blast at the end of June .The production of pig iron fell from 41,800 tons in June to 17,900 tons in July, as compared with 492,700 tons in July 1925.The production of Steel Ingots and Castings in July amounted to 32,100 tons as compared with 34,500 tons in June, and 590,400 tons in July 1925.The position in the Iron and Steel Trade is much the same as last month.   A few firms have found it possible to operate for odd weeks   on foreign coal to meet pressing obligations, but by doing so costs are very high.In the Iron and Steel Trade the percentage of insured workpeople unemployed was 56.2^ on the 26th July as compared with 25/o in July a year ago.There has been no improvement in the Wire trade;    In fact, there has been a falling off In the number of Works operating on part time.   Enquiries are scarce, and the Germans are taking practically the whole of the Export orders which are being placed.The position of the Black and Galvanised Steel Trade remains firm&apos;.   Makers are finding it difficult, however, to work to capacity owing to their inability to obtain regular supplies of materials, as practically the whole of these have to come from abroad, and frequent stoppages occur on this account.There are more enquiries, particularly from abroad, for Constructional material, but this has not yet resulted in any Increased orders being placed.    Constructional Engineers are experiencing greater difficulties in giving delivery of material owing to the absence of supplies of plain material, although the utilisation of foreign material is becoming more general when prompt delivery of this oan be obtained.From SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR :The Trade situation in Sheffield with regard to all the finer kinds of Steel, Engineers&apos; Tools, Saws,etc, is no worse than when I reported to the Advisory Council on the last occasion. In fact, I think there has been some improvement.   We have been able to purchase Westphalian Coke at 63/- per ton, of a quality which has enabled us to continue melting of our Crucible Coke holes with confidence.    There are more people employed making engineers&apos;  tools etc., than there were two months ago.Our export orders come in extraordinarily well and it would appear that our clients, particularly in the Colonies have not been frightened away by the thought of the Coal Strike delaying
C ONFIDENT XAL-IRON AND STEEL (Contd.).deliveries.    In fact, it is quite evident that had not the Coal Strike taken- place, we should now he working at higher pressure than at any time since the collapse in the Autumn of 1920. There Is an ample supply of coal for all the works except the very largest and there has been competition between the out-croppers lately which has reduced the price.   Coal has been bought as low as 38/- up to 48/- of the   outcrop quality, the purchaser, of course, doing his own carriage.   The rolling mills are, however, suffering considerably owing to their being unable to obtain billets from the large steel works, but foreign billets are coming in and while they are not so high a quality as the steel made in Sheffield, they are being made to answer the purpose.Regarding the question of the Spanish Decree, now that Sweden has given way on the class which covers all Steel below .60 Carbon, the whole of the Steel Trade at Sheffield is adverse-ly affected.The South American market is quite active.Some of the big German and French combines are endeavouring to buy up British agencies in this market, which is causing a great deal of difficulty at the moment.NON-FERROUS METALS.From SIR CECIL BUDDt    .On the whole I think that the Non-Ferrous Metal trades are being maintained surprisingly well under the circumstances.    In some directions there Is Increased activity, whilst in others the reverse is the case.In the Birmingham district my reports indicate that there Is some setback, and generally speaking it is estimated that the volume of operations has gone back to something like 50% of normal.    This is borne out by the demand for Copper and Spelter for Brass making purposes, both of which are slow.   The Tin consuming Industries also are slack.   On the other hand Lead manufacturing In all branches goes on with scarcely any interruption, and another satisfactory fact to record is an improvement in the galvanising Industry.The metal markets have been firm and are sustained by the demand in other countries, to which there is no doubt we have lost and are losing a good deal of business.   I feel confident that there is business for our manufacturers to be done when conditions of fuel supply enable them to quote with confidence as to price and time of delivery.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES.From SIR PHILIP NASH:Electrical manufacturers are finding no improvement ? n the Home Market, which continues to be very depressed, and will continue so until the Coal Mining Industry returns to work, and there is an ample supply of coal at reasonable prices.   There appears to be a considerable amount of Electrical work, ready to
ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES (Contd.).be placed, as soon as the strike is over. - The above remarks refer particularly to industrial business - Municipal Power House and Electrical business generally, which is a very considerable market in normal times, is not affected to any great extent by the Coal dispute.    It is more affected by the Electricity Bill, which remains still to be considered in Parliament.   Municipal, as well as other, Electric Power Undertakings are left with uncertainty as to their ultimate position under the Bill when it becomes an Act.    They have no inducement to Incur any large or important expenditure on their undertakings.    Important developments in Electric power under-takings are being held up pending the passing of the Bill, and the normal increase in power supply In the Country is therefore arrested.   The President will realise the importance of the Bill being passed without any avoidable delay.The Export market remains fairly active, but prices are still at an unremunerative level - The absence of volume of business from the Home market makes this position more keenly felt.COTTON.From COLONEL 3SDD0N BROWN rGenerally speaking, the Cotton Trade is still in a very depressed condition, and I regret to say that I cannot report any Improvement in the trade since the date of the last meeting of the Advisory Council.In the section spinning American cotton the mills are still working organised short time.During the past two weeks slightly more business has found its way on to the mill order books, but the total business booked seems only to approximate about 66% of the normal full time production of the mills.    These sales are, however, in excess of the actual production of the mills running as they are on organised short time, which is in some slight degree encouraging.On August 16th the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations Limited, brought into operation their scheme for Basic Selling Prices in this section of the trade.    So far Spinners appear to be quoting prices that give evidence of their anxiety to be loyal to the scheme, and the result has been that prices have hardened and the loss on spinning has been reduced, although prices in strict accordance with the Basic Selling Prices do not yet show any margin of profit to the majority of Spinning Mills In Lancashire.In the section spinning Egyptian cotton trade has now become very bad, organised short time has not been adopted, but a considerable number of firms nave a portion of their plant stopped, as-there is not sufficient margin on yarns to allow for the extra cost of imported fuel.The Weaving section of the trade is still hampered by the difficulty of obtaining Strike Clauses In their contracts.
CONFIDENTIAL. COTTON (Contd.) .Cloth, prices are bad and a considerable number of looms are idle.Taking the trade as a whole it is about as bad as it can be.   This, however, is the season of the year when there is always great anxiety as to the size of the Cotton Crop in America and the consequent effect this factor will have upon the price at which cotton is likely to rule for the season.This fact, coupled with the fact that the cotton trade cannot afford to pay the present price for fuel, and the general fear that buyers naturally have as to whether mills will continue to run or not, has had the effect of producing a universal lack of confidence which is, at the moment, having a very disastrous effect upon trade.CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES. From MR. GALLACHER:The Scottish-Co-operative Wholesale Society is feeling the lockout badly and nearly all our departments are down in sales. Our factories, clothing, flour mills, etc., are on short time, and we can expect no improvement while the stoppage continues.GENERAL TRADE.From MR .&apos; VYLS:I    Cost of foreign bunkers to fishing vessels at Hull.At the meeting of the Advisory Council held on the 4th August Mr. Vyle reported that bunkers for fishing vessels at Hull were being obtained on the Continent, and thus adding about  200 to the expenses of a long distance trip of three weeks. Mr. Vyle has been given the following further information by the Hull Chamber of Commerce;-&quot;The consumption of coal by Hull Trawlers occupied on the Icelandic Grounds, varies from 190 to 220 tons per trip (three weeks).&quot;The difference in price now paid for coal on the Continent varies from 10/- to 12/- compared with normal time bunkering at Hull.&quot;Thus, say 200 tons at 10/- -  100.&quot;The normal passage of a Trawler from Hull to Dunnet Head is 36 hours, but the period elapsing between leaving Hull and signalling Dunnet when bunkering on the Continent, varies from five to six days.&quot;For the purpose of this estimate, three days have been taken as the average additional time, with expenses between  37 and  40 per day, &quot;roughly  100, equivalent to another 10*/&apos;- per ton on the price of coal.&quot;You will recognise that in each case the estimate isbased on the low side and that  200 per trip is by no means an excessive figur--  .
CONFIDENTIAL. GENERAL TRADE (Contd.) .In a later report Mr. Vyle was informed that the additional cost has been further swollen by a continuous rise In coal prices, averaging 6/- per ton extra, added to which there are now more lengthy delays in supplies.2 . LEICESTER .;Boots and Shoes.   Whilst on the whole there is some little improvement in the Boot and Shoe trade, orders received since the holidays have been somewhat small, buyers apparently only placing orders for Immediate requirements.Hosiery.   The trade still remains in the same sluggish conditions.    There is no stream of orders in any Department. Many operatives have nothing whatever to do and thousands are only partially employed.    Until the Coal Strike Is settled we do not expect to get any Improvement xvhatever.Engineering.   Whilst most firms in various branches of the industry are continuing on full time, a good deal of stock is being made, direct orders being held up through the Coal Strike, due to the industries upon which Engineering depends, working short time.Iron Foundries are experiencing great difficulties in getting suitable iron and melting coke, and we are afraid this will continue for a considerable period following the settlement of the Coal Btrlke.This of course re-acts on all other branches who are dependant on foundries for their supplies of castings.Leather.   Business has scarcely resumed since the holiday, quite the typical August conditions with which the generality of the trade is content.   Prices are generally steady and producers have confidence in a better market as soon as normal conditions of trade resume.3. LIVERPOOL.Sugar Refining Industry.    The tone of the Market has been quiet during the whole of August and general business is much hampered by the unsettled Coal position.Canned Goods Trade.    Trade during August has been somewhat poor,  the turnover being below normal, owing to the Coal Strike.West African Trade in July.   Trade on the Uest Coast of Africa during July has remained quiet.    Prices of Palm Oil and Palm Kernels have declined owing to a lack of demand occasioned by the Coal Strike, and this has been reflected on the Coast trade.Dried Fruit Trade.   With the arrival of new crop fruit from the Dominions principally Australia, the little trade that has been done has been practically confined to this fruit, prices for which opened on a fairly high level, but owing to the excellent
CONFIDENTIAL. GENERAL TRADE  (Contd.).condition of their crop the fruit has met with a fairly satisfactory reception, and but for the strike would undoubtedly have gore into consumption at a much quicker rate.4. NEW CASTLE-ON-TYNE.    The position here remains very serious.    The three groat industries, Coal Exporting, Ship-building and Engineering are in a very depressed condition. There is of course,, no export of coal, but foreign coal is being imported in large quantities.    The large proportion of shipyards have not a single order on hand.   Engineering, except Electrical, is practically in the same condition.5* BIRMINGHAM.    Speaking quite generally the position is not so. bad as might have been expected.    Representative manu-facturers in the Hardware Trade state that they are able to keep employed from 70 to lb% of their normal staff of work-people.    The position with regard to fuel supplies appears to be an Improving one on the whole, and there is little difficulty in securing transport either for Inwards or outwards traffic.The Jewellery Trade and the Gun Trade are depressed, whilst in the Aluminium Hollow-ware Trade home conditions are bad, as a result of depressed prices brought about by foreign competition. Owing to this also there is a falling off in the Export Trade in Aluminium Hollow-ware.6. ABERDEEN. Business in the Monumental section of the Granite industry has been affected adversely by the Coal Strike, but not so severely as might have been anticipated.    The Shipbuilding Industry is very depressed and the yards are only about one-fourth employed;    and the Engineering Industry is in a depressed condition.    Trie Fish trade is suffering but is not so badly hit as many other industries.The Export Branch of the Industry, particularly : the Salt Fish section, is very dull as foreign markets are over-stocked; an improvement in this condition however, is looked for within the next month or two.7. GREENOCK.    The position as regards Shipbuilding remains the same.    It is reported that an order for two vessels has been placed with a Port-Glasgow shipbuilding yard, hut though a certain amount of foreign coal is being imported, until the Coal Strike is settled there can be no Improvement in employment.There is no change in the position of the sugar refining industry.    There are still two Refineries working, hut the increase in cost of production caused by the existing price of : coal is naturally extremely serious.8. HULL.General.    The Coal Strike is still affecting the trade of this City, particularly that of the Manufacturing Interests, owing to Increased cost of production consequent upon high prices of imported fuel as against home production.The Imported Coal Is releasing a certain amount of laid up tonnage which required bunkers.    Still Shipping is much affected
GENERAL TRADE (Contd.).by the absence of outward coal cargoes.Fruit Trade.    Trade during the present month.has been slow with a marked lack of demand generally.Seed, Oil and Cake Trade.   The condition of the Oil, Seed and Cake Industry is really unchanged from last month - If anything, the position is rather worse.The Coal Strike Is making it impossible for any crusher to get a margin to crush any class of seed at a profit at the present time.Corn Trade.   From the Statistical position supplies of wheat have been plentiful during the past month, and with prices falling from/- to 1/6 per Qr., Merchants have had a full time. Stocks in Warehouse do not materially increase, therefore a fair consumatlve business must have passed.Hull Fishing Trade.    The Hull Trawler Owners have continue d sending their vessels to sea on completion of the Annual Survey, and the number of vessels now in Dock is about normal for this time of the year.The average price realised for catches during the second week of August was 1.64 pence per lb., compared with 2.06 pence for the same week of 1925 and although prices generally shewed a slight upward tendency during the early part of the period, they have&apos;again fallen.    It Is anticipated that Fish Prices will be still further affected to the detriment of local Vessel Owners by the arrival of Icelandic owned Trawlers which have already made an appearance at this Port.Paint, Colour and Varnish Trade.    There is no improvement to report.   There are signs,- however   that given a speedy ending of the strike, business   is likely to improve with the Hull Manufacturer.9.  SHEFFIELD.The Silver and Cutlery Trades are quiet.During the past three weeks, the number of unemployed has decreased by 2,624.From SIB STANLEY MACHIN:While the dislocation in consequence of the Coal Strike is adversely affecting almost every trade In the Country, when the whole position is reviewed it Is a matter for wonderment that the results are not being more severely felt.   Apart from the heavy basic trades which depend upon   coal for their chief raw material, the manufacturers throughout the Country appear to be surmounting their difficulties and carrying on with remarkable success, bat at an undoubtedly heavy increase of cost.   The food and luxury trades are feeling the effects of the reduced spending power of the people, and the uncertainty of the position is depressing enterprise and causing would-be purchasers to be exceedingly careful in the placing of forward orders.   Yet in spite of the difficulties of the present situation there appears
GENERAL TRADE  (Contd.).to be a feeling that with the settlement of the present trouble there will be a rapid return of confidence and a corresponding return to prosperity.    The Continental markets remain for the most part almost closed to us.    In the overseas markets, there are in many parts, signs of encouragement.   One of the chief causes for anxiety \would   appear to be Canada. From reports recently received, a general feeling of optimism undoubtedly exists in the Dominions, and increased business is generally anticipated, but the ever increasing flood of American capital, and consequent increase in American influence, seems almost certain to have a result detrimental to the Commercial Interests of this Country.   Greatly as we desire a speedy settlement of the Coal Strike, the opinion in all responsible quarters is that any peace arranged on other than a sound economic basis would be nothing less than disastrous.    Commercial opinion is strongly behind the Government in its determination to give nothing further in the way of a subsidy, and also feels that the freedom of the individual and the right to work should be maintained at all costs.I have recently received serious reports as to the difficulties the Sugar Refining industry is passing through at the present time.   Apart from the competition which the English Refiner is being called upon to meet from the subsidised English Beet Sugar Factories the te Isdumping of foreign sugar., especially from Czecho-Slovakia.    it would appear that for the time being Sugar is being sold in this Country at a price below the cost of production.   As a Manufacturer whose chief raw material is Sugar I make no complaint, but as an impartial observer it would seem that the position of the British Refiner as distinct from the Home Beet Factories, is one that requires serious considera-tion.SHIPPING.From SIR ALAN ANDERSON:Index Number of Freights.1920 - 100. 1913 s 100.July 1926................ 26.66 113.93June 1926................ 23.71 101,32July 1925................ 22.06. 94.27Lald-up Tonnage.

9 i K 11JCONFIDENTIAL. SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.From MR. HOSE.Measures to relieve the credit stringency and Industrial depression in Brazil, referred to in my last report to the Council, were recently discussed at a conference between the Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro Commercial Associations and the President of the Republic.    It was decided that the Bank of Brazil, whose resources had been considerably increased through the application of the recent Consolidation loan of (U.S.) ^60,000,0 00, should extend its credit operations, particularly in regard to advances against textile stocks.   The President asserted that he had no Intention of deviating from the policy of deflation, and that the Increased facilities to be given by the Bank of Brazil were to be derived from Its own resources. Special measures were suggested in the State of Sao Paulo, and it is understood that the State will place on deposit with banks having branches in the Interior the proceeds of the second instalment of the loan Issued by the Coffee Institute in June last, and, as soon as possible, the proceeds of the Water-works Loan subscribed in London and New York in March,    It is considered that these measures should result in a gradual improvement in the commercial situation.    It was further resolved that import duties on textiles and other industrial products should be Increased to afford protection to articles of national manufacture.A slight improvement is to be recorded in the general trade situation in Argentina, accompanied by somewhat increased confidence in the outlook   for the immediate future.    The heavy accumulation of stocks of Imported goods during the early part of the current year, however, continues to militate against greater activity In such lines for the time being.The commercial outlook in Peru appears somewhat brighter, and, following the reported formation of an exchange &quot;pool&quot;, a sharp Improvement has occurred in the sterling value of Peruvian currency.    In this connection, it is to be noted that an Issue has been successfully made in New York this month of a 7lr per cent, loan on behalf of the Peruvian Government of (U.S.) $16,000,000, representing the first portion of a total authorised issue of   $30 , 000,00 0.   With regard to the outlook for the import trade, however, retailers are still reported to have heavy stocks on hand.Trading conditions in Chile continue dull, and importers still show a certain reluctance in placing fresh orders.   A]taough the Government has undertaken to examine all possible steps to assist the nitrate industry, it has decided that no relief by way of a reduction in export duties can be granted so as to have effect during the current season, which ends in June next.    The Producers&apos; Association has therefore confirmed the scale of prices fixed for 1926-27, and it remains to be seen to what extent exports of the natural fertiliser on this basis may be affected by offers of the synthetic product.    It Is to be noted, however, that, since the scale of prices has been confirmed, sales of nitrate for delivery during the current season have been reported to the extent of some 1,116,000 metric quintals.
