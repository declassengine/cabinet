THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAhPIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).COPY NO:   gQC A 3 I H E T .THE COAL DISPUTE.Copy of Letter from the Private Secretary to the Prime Minister to the.&quot;&quot;S*ecretary of &quot;the Liners1 &apos; FederatIon of Great Britaint dated October 6th,,1925^10, Downing Street,  S.V.ful. 6th October, 1926.Sir PI am desired by the Prime Minister to draw your attention to the fact that on the 17th September the Government made a conditional offer of legislation to your Federation in the hope of hastening the end of the present dispute in the coal-^ mining industry.      This offer was that as soon as there had been a general resumption of work through provisional district settlements the Government would introduce a Bill to set up a national Arbitration Tribunal to review any provisional settlement under which more than seven hours were bein^r, worked.      It was intimated&quot;to you that since the object of the Government in making this offer was to arrive at an early settlement, they naturally expected to receive the views of your Executive without delay.On the 20th September your Federation sent a communication to the effect that the offer was unacceptable nevertheless,  on the 24th September you were told that, while the proposals could not remian open indefinitely
&quot;your Federation are still free to avail themselves of them by taking the practical step of ordering district negotiations to be set on foot SpeakingIn the House of Commons on the 28th September the Prime minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer emphasised that the proposals could only remain open for a few more days*An answer was expected from your Delegate Conference of the 30th September and it was with reluctance that the Government extended the period in order that the decision of the Conference to consult the districts might be carried out e It is understood that the. Conference is to re-assemble to-morrow and that the views of the districts will then be before them.In these circumstances I am to make it clear that the Government cannot consent to any further prolongation of the offer, which has now been before your Federation for nearly three weeks, but must ask the Conference to give a definite decision either to accept it or to refuse it.      If the offer is accepted by the Liners&apos; Federation, and an immediate and general resumption of work takes place in consequence of It, the Government will introduce the necessary legislation at the earliest possible opportunity.,    Otherwise the offer, which will then have obviously failed in its primary purpose, must be regarded as withdrawn.Yours faithfully,- (Signed)    RONALD VVATERHCUSE.The Secretary,MINERS&apos;  FEDERATION OF GREAT BRITAIN.
