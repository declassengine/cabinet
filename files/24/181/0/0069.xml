DOCUMENT    IS    THE    PROPIRTY    OF    HIS__BRITANNIC    MA JB8TYGOVERNMENT.CABINET,19 (26).MEMORANDUM   BY    THE    MINISTER    OF    LABOUR. UNEMPLOYMENT    GRANTS    COMMITTEE.The appended memorandum by Lord St. Davids asks for instructions with regard to the future operations of the Unemployment Grants Committee of which he is Chairman,, The scope of these grants was drastically reduced at the end of last year.     Since that date the Committee, while continuing to function, has approved grants only in a very limited class of cases0Indeed the criteria applied are such as to rule out many important towns, e.g., London (in greater part), Manchester,  Birmingham, Leeds and Bristol,Before the estimates for next year are finally closed we shall have to define our future policy.     But I anticipate that when Parliament meets we shall be asked to state our intentions.    In view of the high unemployment figure, considerable pressure may be put upon us to relax some of the new restrictions on the grants.     And there are Indications that some local authorities are moving in this direction.I think, however, that we ought not to yield to any such pressure.Owing to the continuance of the coal stoppage, any estimate of the industrial conditions likely to exist next year can only be conjectural;    we have as yet no safe basis/ on
on which to decide whether it will be necessary and possible to extend, these grants or whether it will be feasible to reduce them still further,    ,It seems to me, therefore, that for the present the only thing to do is to continue the restricted system of grants on the existing basis.     Subject to any observations which my colleague may wish to make, I propose to instruct the Committee accordingly. &apos;   .(Intd.)   A. S-M.Ministry of Labour. 4th November, 1926.
UNEMPLOYMENT GRANTS COMMITTEE. Note on Future Pr ooedure ,,In view of the decision come to by the Government In the Autumn of 1925 to restrict the operation of unemployment grants, the Unemployment Grants Committee issued to Local Authorities on the 15th December 1925, a Circular Letter, copy of which was attached to CePc 29(26),     Administrative effect was given to the policy outlined in the Circular by restricting grants to districts in which the unemployment was 15% or over, and where the works were very appreciably accelerated, that is to say, as far as could be judged, by 5 years at least,In connection with this arrangement it should be borne in mind that the incidence of the coal strike made it for obvious reasons impossible to utilise current figures for estimating the volume of unemployment which should entitle a district to grant.    Consequently the figures on which the Committee have been working are average figtires of all unemployed persons taken over a period of months ending 26th April last.    If actual current figures apart from those relating to miners had been taken, the number of localities eligible to receive grant would of course have been very much greater.The restrictive effect of the new procedure is obvious from the figures of applications received and schemes approved.The applications received during the last six months of the last full yearTs working (July 1925 to June 1926) amounted nearly to  3,080,000 in value as against  14,823,000 for the first six months of the year, and  9,193,000 for the corresponding six months of the previous year.The applications received during the last three months compare   with those received in the corresponding period/of
of 1925 as follows :-1926, 1925.July.  315,000  6,476,000August.  398,000  2\465,000September. 82,000  2,419,000The value of schemes approved since the issue of theCircuit-.r of December 1925;, i.e. d\.xring the 9 months ended30th September, 1926, amounts to  3,264,000 as    compared with 9,830,000 in corresponding 9 months of the previous year.The particulars are as follows :-1926g 1925.January-June.  2,722,000  6,943,000July.  145,000  1,882,000August.  2 46,000  583,000September.  151,000  422,000It will thus be seen that both as regards the value of applications received and of schemes approved, the work has declined rapidly.The applications approved since the issue of the December 1925 Circular fall into two categories, namely, (l) schemes to which the new conditions applied, and (2) schemes which fell to be considered under the old conditions, particularly those outstanding at the date of the Circular letter, and specially approved under the terms of the pledge given by the Prime Minister to the Deputation of Local Authorities which waited upon him In February last.Of the  3,264,000 approved for grant since December,1925, only  963,000 relates to schemes approved under the new conditions the value of outstanding applications is now only  275,000.The procedure at present f oil owed by the Committee excludes from eligibility for grant many important towns, e,ge/London
London (in greater part), Manchester, Birmingham., Leeds, Bristol, Bradford and Nottingham, where the average of unemployment up to the period of the strike did not amount to 15%, but where in many cases the unemployment existing at the present date would undoubtedly exceed this figure, and it is  of course somewhat anomalous to make or refuse grants for unemployment work on figures averaged over a period which has ended six months ago*It was understood that the general position should be reviewed during October, with a view to determining the line of. action to be followed by the Committee during the coming Winter.Having regard, therefore, to the present and prospective unemployment position, which may be expected to continue unsatisfactory for some time after the settlement of the coal strike, the Committee would be glad to know whether they are to continue on their present course of action, or whether this should be restricted still further;    or whether it should be extended by taking into account the actual unemployment figures up to date (excluding of course men on strike) as well as the average figures prior to the strike, or possibly averaging both periods.(Signed)    ST. DAVID.P.5th October, 1926.
