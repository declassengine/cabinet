ISOfrjg document is the property of Hia Britannic Majesty &apos;s Government.)C R E T.CABINET.364(26) .STRENGTH OF POLICE FORCES IN THE COALFIELDS.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.As a result of the discussion in the Cabinet last week I sent the following personal letter to each of the Chief Constables concerned -&quot;I have naturally been following with, great care the &quot;position of affairs during the coal stoppage, more &quot;particularly during the recent weeks,  as it affects the &quot;Police Forces in certain areas of the country.&quot;It is the distinct wish and intention of H.M. Government &quot;that the utmost protection should be afforded to every man &quot;who desires to work in the coal mines of the country. &quot;Developments which have taken place since your report v;as &quot;furnished in reply to my circular of 8th instant have &quot;naturally altered the situation in some respects,  and I &quot;should be glad if you would lot me know whether you are &quot;satisfied that in the present situation the Police now under &quot;your control are sufficient to enable this object to be &quot;fully carried out.&quot;As you have already been informed,  ample Police are &quot;available in other parts of the country and arrangements &quot;can be made for you to have such further reinforcements, &quot;if any, as you may desire.&quot;I should accordingly be glad if you would reply to me if &quot;possible by return of post letting me have your views on &quot;the situation in the light of this letter.&quot;The general effect of the replies is that steps are beingtaken in all areas to protect men who are at work, that thesituation is at present considered satisfactory from a policepoint of view but is being closely watched, that the possibilityof unfavourable developments will not be overlooked and thatapplications for reinforcements will be made immediately if andwhen need arises.    In many counties the local force has alreadybeen considerably increased by the use of    reserves and by borrowing men from other districts,  and all chief constables know that they can have further help if wanted.    TheChief Constables are in the best position to judge of the localsituation and the nedessity for and the effect of introducing
&quot;foreign&quot; police:    but in order to ensure the closest &quot;liaison&quot;between the responsible local officers and the Government theHome Office keeps in the closest touch with the chief constables:    telephonic communication with all importantdistricts takes place at least once a day and often more frequently, and the business of arranging for reinforcementswherever they are needed is constantly going on.Some extracts from the Chief Constables&apos;  replies to myletter may be of interest to my colleagues.    For example, theGhi9f Constable of Carmarthenshire said -&quot;Ammanford district is exceptionally quiet and has been &quot;throughout.    There is no doubt that the 100 odd cases of &quot;imprisonment for rioting &amp;c last year has had a very &quot;great effect.    Many who didn&apos;t think they really had &quot;committed any offence found themselves in prison, and the &quot;Emergency Regulations have had a wonderfully restraining &quot;influence on the leaders.&quot;The Chief Constable of Monmouthshire said -&quot;In the event of a shortage of men in any emergency &quot;reinforcements from Newport and Cardiff can be quickly &quot;obtained.    I believe we shall pull through, satisfactorily &quot;with a little patience.    To guard all Collieries and men &quot;going to and fro and watch their homes to the extent of &quot;reassuring the timid, would require an enormous body of &quot;Police.&quot;The Chief &apos;Constable of Glamorgan said -&quot;For the moment things are quiet in this County, although &quot;it is impossible to predict what is likely to occur in the &quot; future.&quot;After stating the arrangements already made to strengthen his force, he added -&quot;I consider that these arrangements ..... will have a&quot;most salutary effect.    I will immediately report to you &quot;any indications of further trouble.&quot;Shortly afterwards, the Chief Constable called for further reinforcements and about 380 men were sent immediately.The Chief Constable of the West Riding, whoso force hadalready been augmented by 200 men, said he had circularisedall his Superintendents asking if they were quite satisfiedthat they had sufficient men, and as a result he had arranged for a small further addition to his force.    He added -&quot;My policy is to give, so far as lies within my power, &quot;protection to all men re-starting work so that there may &quot;be no falling off in numbers owing to fear.&quot;
The Chief Constable of Lancashire, whose force had beenaugmented by 350 &quot;reserves&quot;,  said -&quot;I feel  sure that within a very short time the majority&quot;of the men will return to work ...... I feel that I have&quot;sufficient men to deal with any situation which may&quot;arise ...... In view of Cook&apos;3 campaign I have been&quot;increasing my numbers...... I have, however, not over-looked the fact that I can get extra men from other &quot;Forces,  and if the necessity should arise I would &quot;acquaint the Home Office at once.&quot;The Chief Constable of Nottinghamshire reported that he was quite satisfied that the police under his control, who hadalready been augmented by 325 men, were sufficient, butindicated that if there should be developments for the worsehe would call for further reinforcements.    He said -&quot;At the moment, Mr. Cook and other officials of the &quot;Miners&apos; Federation are conducting an intensive campaign &quot;in this area.    They have today  (i.e.  19th October) &quot;addressed numerous large meetings, and have been content &quot;to urge the miners now at work,  to cease work.    As a &quot;result,  I think the numbers at work will decrease and will &quot;continue for a time to decrease whilst the campaign lasts-&quot;According to my information no exception can be taken to &quot;the speeches so far delivered-&quot;There is at present no intimidation or violence being &quot;used or attempted, nor do I anticipate that there will be, &quot;so long as the leaders continue to address meetings in the &quot;present moderate manner.&quot;W.J.H.27th October,   1926.
