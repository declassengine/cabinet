[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Imperial Conference.   October 1926.SECRET. Copy No.E (E) 20.IMPERIAL CONFERENCE, 1926.OIL POLLUTION OF NAVIGABLE WATERS.Proposed International Convention.Memorandum prepared for the Imperial Conference.THE problem of the pollution by oil of coastal waters and the shores of the sea was practically unknown before the war. But mainly owing to the recent develop-ment of the use of fuel oil, oil pollution has become a source of trouble.in the majority of maritime countries. The main source of the trouble is undoubtedly the discharge of waste oil or ballast or bilge water mixed with oil by oil-burning or oil-carrying vessels.In Great Britain, in most of the Dominions, and in many foreign countries steps have been taken by legislation or by local regulations and bye-laws to prohibit the discharge of oil in territorial waters or in harbour waters [e.g., in Great Britain the discharge of oil within territorial limits is prohibited under a penalty of  100 by the Oil in Navigable Waters Act, 1922). But it is generally recognised that much of the nuisance is due to the discharge of oil outside the normal territorial limits. Oil floats for long periods of time, and refuse discharged even far out to sea may drift inshore under the action of wind and tide. It has long been generally held that an effective remedy could only be found by restricting or prohibiting the discharge of oil and oily mixtures (unless first treated by some form of separating apparatus to extract most of the oil), either over the high seas generally or over wide areas of inshore waters.In July 1922 a joint resolution of Congress was passed in the United States, where the trouble has been particularly acute, requesting the President to call a conference of maritime nations. Following on this resolution an Inter-depart-mental Committee was set up in the United States to collect all available information and prepare the ground for an international conference. This Committee reported in March 1926, and the report was published by the Government of the United States of America.A preliminary international conference of technical experts was invited to meet at &quot;Washington on the 8th June last to consider questions relating to the pollution of navigable waters by oil. The objects of the conference were to facilitate an exchange of views on technical matters and to consider the formulating of proposals for dealing with the problem of oil pollution of navigable waters through inter-national agreement. Gi*eat Britain was represented at the conference and also the Dominion of Canada.The final Act of the Conference was signed on the 16th June and has been printed in Great Britain as a Command Paper (see Annex). Briefly, the conference recommended that provision should be made for a system of prescribed areas on the coasts of maritime countries and on recognised fishing grounds, within which no oil or oily mixtures containing more than -05 of 1 per cent, of oil should be discharged; that the width of these areas should normally not exceed 50 nautical miles, but that in exceptional cases the width might be extended to 150 nautical miles; and that each Government should require vessels flying its flag to respect all such areas. The conference annexed to their report a draft convention to give effect to their recommendations.[15132]
During the proceedings of the conference it appeared that the only alternative policy to that recommended by the conference would be to require ships which are possible sources of pollution to be fitted with some inexpensive form of separating apparatus. This course was strongly advocated at the conference by the United States Delegation and was supported by the delegates from Great Britain and Canada.The Scandinavian delegates and the Dutch and also some of the others were entirely opposed to this course, and ultimately the United States delegates agreed that what they regarded as the ideal and best solution should be abandoned in favour of one which would command general agreement, viz., the establishment of a system of zones. As to the desirability of establishing a zone system, all the delegates at the conference were agreed. Those who thought that the ideal solution was the fitting of some kind of separating apparatus realised that some interval would have to elapse before the system could be made compulsory, and that in the interval something like a zone system would in any case have to be established. The majority were of opinion that a zone system; if properly worked, would do all that was necessary. Should this hope be disappointed it will still be possible to adopt the alternative of insisting on the provision of separating apparatus.His Majesty&apos;s Government are disposed to accept the recommendations of the Washington Conference in principle, and are considering whether it is necessary to suggest any amendments of detail in the draft Convention. It is suggested that the question whether the recommendations can be accepted by the various countries of the Empire might be considered by the conference.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, Otitooer 1926.

15th June, 1926.FINAL ACT OF THE PRELIMINARY CONFERENCE ON OIL POLLUTION OF NAVIGABLE WATERS.At the invitation of the Government of the United States, a preliminary Conference of experts met at Washington on 8th June, 1926, to consider questions relating to the pollution of navigable waters by oil, the object of the Conference being to facilitate an exchange of views on technical matters and to consider the formulating of proposals for dealing with the problem of oil pollution of navigable waters through international agreement.The Governments participating in the Conference and their representatives were : The United States of America : by The Honorable Joseph S.

The representative of the Netherlands stated that the oil nuisance in his country had been reduced to negligible propor-tions and was no longer troublesome. So far as it existed, he considered that it arose much more from oil-burning vessels than from oil-carrying vessels.The representative of Canada stated that he considered that bilge water was an important factor in causing oil pollution, and recommended that any measures directed towards preventing oil pollution should take into account that factor.With these qualifications, the statements as to the facts of oil pollution and the estimate as to causes contained in the United States Report were regarded as forming a sound basis for the work of the Conference. The passages of the Report to which reference is made are as follows : as to facts concerning conditions in different countries, pages 18-23 and 104-119; as to causes, pages 23-24.It was agreed that there has been a marked diminution of oil pollution since attention was first called to it, due both to the action of the Governments and to the voluntary co-operation of the interests concerned, but that the evil is still serious in some waters and that it can only be dealt with satisfactorily by inter-national action.The principal causes of oil pollution are vessels and. land installations and terminals. As sources.of pollution on land are largely limited to territorial waters and are being dealt with, and can only be dealt with, by the Governments concerned, this branch of the subject was not pursued by the Conference, and attention was concentrated on the other principal cause of pollu-tion, vessels.It was agreed that the only vessels which need be taken into account as potential sources of oil pollution, for the purposes of this conference, are seagoing vessels carrying crude, fuel or Diesel oil, in bulk as cargo or as fuel for boilers or engines, and that these classes of vessels should be covered by any regulations that may be adopted.Two classes of vessels require special mention, war vessels and small craft. War vessels are usually dealt with as a separate class, and it is assumed that the naval authorities of each country will take the necessary measures to ensure that those classed as war vessels take every possible precaution to prevent oil pollu-tion. Small craft may find it difficult to comply fully with the regulations that may be laid down, and special provisions may have to be made to meet their case, but they should be required to do all that is reasonable and practicable to avoid oil pollution, and any special provisions should apply only to vessels of limited hunker content.There is no hard and fast line dividing oily mixtures which are harmful from those practically innocuous, and opinions may differ as to the precise point at which the line should be drawn ;
but the Conference, alter hearing the experts, came to the con-elusion that a mixture containing more than -05 of one per cent, of crude, fuel or Diesel oil, should be regarded as constituting a nuisance, and that for ail practical purposes a mixture con-taining this percentage of oil or less need not, at any rate beyond territorial limits, be regarded as constituting a nuisance. Oily mixtures constituting a nuisance can generally be recognised by the film, visible to the naked eye in daylight in clear weather, which they produce on the surface of the sea.The Conference is not in agreement at this time as to the extent and effects of pollution caused by deposit of oily mixtures on the high seas at distances greater than 50 miles from shore. One opinion is that such pollution already exists, that ocean fisheries are thereby endangered, and that oily discharges on the high seas tend to preserve their character for an indefinite period and may be borne by winds and currents into coastal waters and contribute to coastal pollution. For that reason the repre-sentatives of some Governments considered that after a specified period of notice the discharge of oily mixtures constituting a nuisance should be prohibited everywhere, and that, in the mean-time, a system of areas should be established within which no such discharge should be allowed. The other opinion was to the effect that a sufficient case had not been made out for pro-hibition everywhere, and that the establishment of an effective system of areas would provide a complete or almost complete cure for the evils complained of.Both parties agree that the first measure is the establishment of a system of areas and both parties agree that such a system, if properly established and properly worked, will go a very con-siderable way toward curing the evil.The Conference, therefore, agreed to recommend that a system of areas should be established on the coasts of maritime countries, and on recognised fishing grounds, within which no oil or oily mixtures, which constitute a nuisance, should be discharged.Each country can determine what the width of the areas off its own coasts should be, in the light of its own special circum-stances and conditions, such as prevailing winds, currents and the extent of its fishing grounds, and after consultation with its neighbours where this appears necessary. The general rule in the case of coasts bordering the open sea should be that the width of the area should not exceed 50 nautical miles, but that&apos; in exceptional cases, where the peculiar configuration of the coast or other special circumstances render such a course neces-sary, the width might be extended to 150 nautical miles.Pull information as to the extent of all areas, in the form ol marked charts or otherwise, should be circulated to all Govern-ments concerned., and it would greatly facilitate the establishment and working of the system of areas under international agreement if one Government were to undertake the duty of receiving, co-ordinating and circulating information upon the subject.
There are already a number of vessels equipped with apparatus for the separation of oil from their oily mixtures, and it is con-templated that the number of such vessels will materially increase. One obstacle to the installation of such apparatus lies in the apprehension in the minds of those concerned that, under the laws of some countries, vessels installing it might either incur some penalty in the matter of payment of dues based upon tonnage or might not receive any benefit from the resulting sacrifice of cargo space. It is recommended that necessary changes in admeasurement laws be made by the various Govern-ments to the end that such disadvantages may be removed.The Conference has reached an agreement on the following recommendations to the respective Governments for adoption by international agreement : (1) That the Governments concerned provide for a system of prescribed areas in waters off their coasts beyond territorial limits (if necessary, after consultation with neigh-bouring governments) within which vessels of the classes mentioned in Recommendation No. 4 shall not discharge crude, fuel or Diesel oil or mixtures having an oil content greater than that stated in Recommendation No. 5.(2; That along coasts bordering the open sea, such areas shall not extend more than 50 nautical miles from the coast, except, that if such extent is in particular instances found insufficient because of the peculiar configuration of the coast line or other special conditions, the Government affected may extend its area to a width of not exceeding 150 nautical miles, after consultation with neighbouring Governments, if necessary.(3) That due notice of the establishment of any areas shall be given to the Governments concerned in the form of marked charts or otherwise.(4) iThat the. regulations adopted with respect to pre-scribed areas shall be applicable to all seagoing vessels, other than war vessels, carrying crude, fuel or Diesel oil in bulk as cargo or as fuel for boilers or engines, due con-sideration being given to the special necessities of small vessels. It is assumed that the naval authorities of each country will take the necessary measures to ensure that vessels classed as war vessels shall take every possible pre-caution to prevent oil pollution.(5) That the discharge of oil or oily mixtures be pro-hibited within such areas if the oil content exceeds -05 of one per cent., that is, if it is sufficient to constitute a film on the surface of the sea visible to the naked eye in day-light in clear weather.(6) That each Government agree to use all reasonable means to require its vessels to respect all such areas.(7) That no penalty or disability of any kind whatever in the matter of tonnage measurement or payment of dues
sbe incurred by any vessel by reason only of the fitting of any device or apparatus for separating oil from water.(8) That dues based on tonnage shall not be charged in respect of any space rendered unavailable for cargo by the installation of any device or apparatus for separating oil from water.(9) That the term &quot; device or apparatus for separating oil from water,&quot; as used in Recommendations Nos. 7 and 8, shall include any tank or tanks, of reasonable size, used exclusively for receiving waste oil recovered from the device or apparatus, and also the piping and fittings necessary for its operation.(10) That each Government should carefully observe the operation and effect of the area system off its coasts, and exchange information thereon with the other interested Governments, so that if, after reasonable experience, any Government may consider that such areas do not sufficiently protect its coasts, or that pollution beyond such areas has become or threatens to become a menace, such Government may be in position to raise with the other Governments the question whether the discharge beyond the limit of such areas of oil or oily mixtures constituting a nuisance should be prohibited.(11) That a central agency be established as soon as practicable for receiving, co-ordinating and circulating to the Governments concerned information of interest relating to the system of areas, the establishment of which is sug-gested in the foregoing recommendations, the experience with that system and other data deemed advisable.For the purpose of facilitating the conclusion of an international agreement, the annexed draft of a convention is submitted for the consideration of the respective Governments.Done at the City of Washington this sixteenth day of June, One thousand nine hundred and twenty-six.Joseph S.

ANNEX.DRAFT  OF  CONVENTION.Tho Governments of.............&apos;.............................desiring to take action by common accord to prevent pollution of navigable waters by oil or oily mixtures&apos; discharged from vessels, have resolved to conclude a Convention for this purpose, and have appointed as their Plenipotentiaries:  Who, having communicated to each other their respective full powers, found to be in good and due form, have agreed as follows:  -I.The respective Governments may establish areas in waters adjacent to their coasts within which discharge from the vessels specified in Art. III. of oil or oily mixtures as defined in Art. II. shall be pro-hibittd, in accord with the following principles:  (a) In the case of coasts bordering the open sea, such areas shall not extend more than 50 nautical miles from the coast except that, if such extent is in particular instances found insufficient because of peculiar configuration of the coast line or other special con-ditions, such areas may be extended to a width not exceeding 150 nautical miles.(b) In case the Government of any country desires to prescribe an area any part of which may be within 150 nautical miles of the coast of another country, that Government shall inform the Government of such other country before the area is prescribed.(c) Due notice of the establishment of any area or areas, and of any change thereof, shall be given to the Governments of maritime States, in the form of charts or otherwise, by the central agency mentioned in Article VII.II.The discharges which may be prohibited in any area prescribed pursuant to Article I. are (a) crude, fuel or Diesel oil, or (&amp;) any mix-ture containing more than &quot;05 of one per cent, of such oil, or having a content of such oil sufficient to form a film on the surface of the sea visible to the naked eye in daylight in clear weather.III.The vessels which may be affected pursuant to the provisions of Article I. are all seagoing vessels, other than war vessels, . carrying crude, fuel or Diesel oil, in bulk as&apos; cargo or as fuel for boilers or engines. Special provisions may be adopted to meet the case of small vessels of limited bunker capacity, but such vessels shall be required to take all reasonable precautions to prevent oil pollution.The respective Governments agree to take the necessary measures to ensure that vessels classed as war vessels shall take every possible precaution to prevent oil pollution.
V.Each Government will require vessels of the class specified in Article III., flying its national flag, when within any area prescribed pursuant to Article I., to refrain from discharging oil or oily mixtures as defined in Article II.VI.The respective Governments agree :  (a) That no penalty or disability of any kind whatever in the matter of tonnage measurement or payment of dues be incurred by any vessel by reason only of the fitting of any device or apparatus for separating oil from water.(b) That dues based on tonnage shall not be charged in respect of any space rendered unavailable for cargo by the installation of any device or apparatus for separating oil from water.(c) That the term &quot; device or apparatus for separating oil from water,&quot; as used in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Article, shall include any tank or tanks of reasonable size, used exclusively for receiving waste oil recovered from the device or apparatus, and also the piping and fittings necessary for its operation.VII.The Government of   ...........................   is   invited   to   establish a central agency for the purpose of receiving, co-ordinating and circulate-ing to the Governments of maritime States information relating to the system of areas established under the terms of this Convention, the experience with that system, and other data pertaining to the problem of oil pollution of navigable waters and means for dealing with that problem.In the event of this invitation being accepted the other contracting Governments undertake to forward to the central agency the data specified in paragraph (c) of Article I. hereof, and also all other informa-tion which they consider appropriate for the purposes of this Article.VIII.The Government of the United States will invite the Governments of maritime States other than the signatories to adhere to the present Convention. Such adherence shall be notified to the Government of the United States and by the latter to all the other Governments&apos; signatories to the Convention.IX.The present Convention shall take effect as soon as the ratification of five of the Governments represented at the &quot;Washington Conference of June, 1926, shall have been notified to the Government of the United States. It may be denounced by any Government on notifica-tion to the Government of the United States to take effect one year from the date upon which^such notification shall have been made.(7/26)  i59533r-1)  Wt. 13551-423  500  10/26  H.

[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.-]miPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1926.SECRET.For the use of British Representatives only. Not Circulated to the Dominions.copy No. 30E (E.B.) 21.CABINET.Imperial Conference, 1926.P.C. Br. 23 B.BRUSSELS MARITIME LAW CONVENTIONS.Brief submitted by the Inter-Departmental Committee onEconomic Questions.Note.THE attached draft Brief for Ministers relates to four Maritime Law Conven-tions adopted by Diplomatic Conferences at Brussels.Of these conventions, effect has already been given in this country to that relating to Bills of Lading, while His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided to adept that concerning the Limitation of Shipowners&apos; Liability.No definite decision has yet been taken to adopt the Maritime Mortgages and Liens Convention, and it is suggested that the Cabinet should now be asked to approve this course.The Convention relating to the Immunity of State-owned Ships is still the subject of consideration in respect of several points between the Admiralty, the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade, but it is hoped that it will be possible to take a definite decision regarding its adoption by this country before the Convention comes up for consideration at the Imperial Conference.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, October 12, 1926.The Memorandum prepared for the Imperial Conference on the Brussels Maritime Law Conventions contains copies of the English versions of the four draft conventions, adopted by Diplomatic Conferences at Brussels, which relate to the following matters : (1) Bills of Lading ; (2) the Limitation of Shipowners&apos; Liability; (3) Maritime Mortgages and Liens; and (4) the Immunity of State-owned Ships. Notes on the four draft conventions are included in the Memorandum, and the following supplementary notes have been prepared for the use of the British Representatives: The Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1924, gave effect to the Bills of Lading Con-vention in this country. A recommendation is made in the Memorandum that those overseas Dominions which have not so far adopted similar legislation should now consider whether they can give early effect to the Resolution of the last Imperial Conference which recommended action on those lines.The only Dominions which have so far adopted legislation to give effect to the Convention are Australia and India. South Africa has a Bill under consideration, and Canada, New Zealand and the Irish Free State are understood to be still con-sidering the matter. Newfoundland has recently agreed to propose legislation for consideration.  A large number of the Colonies already have legislation in operation.The international uniformity of the law relating to bills of lading would greatly facilitate overseas trade by removing an element of doubt from the minds of shippersDraft Brief for Ministers.Bills of Lading.[15156]
and shipowners as to what their liability under the contract of carriage is likely to be. As all the important maritime Powers, with the exception of the Scandinavian countries, have now signed the Convention, and some of them have prepared legisla-tion to give effect to the Convention, there is reason to think that uniformity is in a fair way to achievement. The adoption of the Convention throughout the British Empire, in addition to being of advantage to inter-imperial trade, would encourage the movement towards the adoption of legislation to give effect to the Convention, and thus lead to international uniformity.Legislative Considerations.In this country, prior to the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1924, the general rights and obligations of the parties to a contract for the carriage of goods by sea were regulated by the Common Law. The Bills of Lading Convention prescribed certain Rules applicable to contracts of carriage covered by Bills of Lading, and, in order to give these Rules the force of law in this country, that is to say, Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Act of 1924 was passed. It is restricted to the carriage of goods by sea in ships carrying goods from any port in Great Britain or Northern Ireland. The general legal principle is that a contract is to be construed according to the law of the place of contract, and it follows that the law of the place where the Bill of Lading is issued should provide for the application of the Rules. If, therefore, as is very desirable, the Rules are to apply to Bills of Lading issued in the Dominions, it is necessary that the Dominions should adopt the Rules by their domestic-legislation.Limitation of Shipowners&apos; Liability.It has already been decided to give effect to this Convention so far as the United Kingdom is concerned. At present the law relating to the limitation of shipowners&apos; liability is uniform throughout the Empire because it is contained in Part VIII of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, which has Imperial application. The object of the Convention is to obtain international uniformity in this matter. It is therefore desirable that any steps taken within the British Empire to give effect to the Conven-tion should be such as will preserve the uniformity now existing by securing the simultaneous operation of the Convention in all parts of the Empire.Legislative Considerations.The provisions of the Convention differ in many respects from the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act, and, in order to effect a change in the law in accordance with the Convention, it would be necessary to proceed in one of two ways : 1. By an amendment of the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act; or . By the repeal of those provisions and a fresh enactment confined to GreatBritain and Northern Ireland, leaving it to the Dominions to adoptsimilar legislation. gHere, again, in order to give effect to the provisions of the Convention, it is essential that those provisions should be incorporated in the lex loci fori, that is, the municipal law of any country in which a ship may happen to be or in which any liability of the shipowner may happen to be litigated.If the Imperial Parliament legislates for Great Britain and Northern Ireland and no legislation is passed either by the Imperial Parliament or by the Dominion Parliaments applying the Convention to the Dominions, the position will be that the Convention will apply to all ships, British, Colonial or Foreign, when brought before the Courts of this country, but in the Dominions the law as contained in Part VIII of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, will continue to apply, or if Part VIII is entirely repealed by the Imperial Parliament and no legislation is passed by the Dominion Parliaments, then there will be no limitation of liability for any ships in the Dominions unless such Dominions in fact legislate on the matter.If the change of law effected by the Convention is to be made by an amendment of the Merchant Shipping Act, then unless such amendment is expressly limited in its application to the United Kingdom it will apply to the Dominions as the Act of 1894 already applies to those Dominions.Maritime Mortgages and Liens.In the Memorandum prepared for the Imperial Conference it is stated that His Majesty&apos;s Government are considering the Convention in detail and suggest
that it might also be examined by the other countries of the Empire. No definite decision has yet been taken to adopt this Convention so far as regards the United Kingdom, but, for the reasons given below, the Board of Trade favour the passing of the legislation necessary, to give effect to the Convention...The object of the Convention is to secure international uniformity in the law regarding the recognition of mortgages and regarding the limitation of the kinds of claims which may rank before the mortgage and the ranking of those claims among themselves. The matter has been under the consideration of diplomatic conferences since 1908, and it has proved exceedingly difficult to draft a convention containing a satisfactory compromise between the legal systems of the different countries of the World.This Convention and that relating to the limitation of shipowners&apos; liability have been considered together at the different diplomatic conferences, and there has been an understanding that the two Conventions were inter-related. It has been suggested by some of the Continental delegates that there was before the War an understanding that if they accepted a liability convention we would accept one on mortgages and liens. We have not accepted that position, but undoubtedly our acceptance of the Mortgages and Liens Convention would encourage other countries to accept the Liability Convention.Examination of the Mortgages and Liens Convention indicates that its pro-visions are in conformity with agreements reached between representatives of British shipowners, shippers, bankers, underwriters and other interests before the last Conference. It is quite clear that no better Convention will be attainable by waiting, and that the wide adoption of the present Convention would be of great advantage to the various interests concerned. The Convention can therefore be recommended for adoption throughout the Empire both on its own merits and in order to secure wider acceptance of the Convention relating to Shipowners&apos; Liability.Legislative Considerations.In this country the priority of liens inter se and over the mortgagee is regulated almost entirely by the common law, and on general principles such a matter would depend on the lex loci fori where the question of the rights relating to the charge are being litigated. This matter, therefore, might be treated on the same lines as the Bills of Lading Convention, and the position is that any legislation passed here will deal with liens on all ships when the liens or mortgages are sought to be enforced in the Courts of the United Kingdom.Unless and until the Dominions legislate on similar lines the law on these matters in those Dominions will remain as it is to-day, with regard to all ships, if proceedings are brought with regard to liens and mortgages in Dominion Courts. The uniformity which now largely exists, in fact, would thus disappear, and it is therefore desirable that the Dominions should legislate on lines similar to the lines of legislation in the United Kingdom.Immunity of State-Owned Ships.It is stated in the Memorandum prepared for the Imperial Conference that a statement will be made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government as to whether this Convention can be accepted. A number of points, mainly on matters of detail, are receiving consideration by the Admiralty, the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade, and it is not yet possible to make a definite recommendation. The principle of the Convention is acceptable, and if it is possible to provide safeguards without amendment of the Convention for the points which the Admiralty have raised, it will be possible to recommend that it should be adopted subject to these safeguards.Legislative Considerations.By Sub-Section 2 of Section 80 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1906, the powers of the legislature of any British possession to regulate any Government ships under the control of the Government of that possession are unaffected by the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Acts. It would appear, therefore, that (assuming it is decided to adopt the Convention) after the adherence of the Dominions to the Convention has been notified, separate legislation by each of the Dominions will be necessary in order to carry out the provisions of the Convention in those countries, and until this is done the pre-Convention law and practice as to the liability of Dominion-Government-owned ships will remain unaltered.
