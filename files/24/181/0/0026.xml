Mr. Chupxhill : I cannot say that we were surprised to receive the answer which you sent to our letter proposing tho three-cornered conference, because we had before us your state-ment at the meeting ten days ago with the men and also the letter that you have been good enough to write us telling tis what your&apos; view is and the great importance you attach to it. But if the Government were not surprised by the answer, they are deeply concerned at it, and lve have various considerations which we should like to put before you. The consideration which takes priority over everything else and which, if established, I am sure would weigh the most heavily in your minds, is the question of the general understanding on this point, the basis of under-standing, which has subsisted between his Majesty&apos;s Government and the Mining Association during this long-drawn and protracted dispute.Mr. Evan Williams : Did you say miners or mine owners? Mr. Churchill : The Mining Association.Now, there are two quite distinct points which are habitually confused. The first is this : Assuming that there will continue to be as there has been since 1921, a national agreement dealing with certain aspects of the wage question and district agreements dealing with others, what subjects are to be dealt with in each? In particular, is the minimum percentage to continue to find a place in the national agreement, as the men claim, or is it to be transferred to the district agreements, as the owners claim? That is what I may call one question. That is the first question. The second question is this: Is there to be any national agreement at all or is the industry in future to be regulated purely by district agreements without any national wage-negotiating bodies? That is the second, the alternative question. Now, up to the meeting between yourselves and the men, on the 19th August, the issue was No. 1, the issue was the first of those questions. On the 19th August, owing to your declaration, the issue became No. 2; it became the second of those questions. That is the point with which we are concerned at the present moment, and that is the only point with which we are concerned at the present moment and it is very important that that point should not be obscured by being mixed up with the first and more complicated point. Let me state what, in my judgment, is the issue across the table at the moment. It is, Is there to be any national agreement at all, or is the industry in future to be regulated purely by district agreements without any national wage negotiating body ? Now, that is the only point to which I want to ask you to address yourselves this afternoon. As to  details,   it  is  perfectly clear that there   must   be district
27agreements.    It is perfectly clear that this matter can never be-settled in all its details of wages and hours by a conference in London; it has got to be settled in the districts, but the extent, to which the district agreements are related to a national structure, the extent to which national machinery on both sides is to be preserved that  is the issue  before us  at the present  time. Now I should like, if you will allow me, to make some quotations from your declarations in the past,  Mr. Williams.    When this question first arose you argued before the Royal Commission that any form of national agreement was wrong, and that the industry ought to revert to the pre-war system of regulation by district agreements.   Well, the Royal Commission did not accept that view.    I am not one of those who consider that the Royal Commission Report is a sort of bible, from which everything that is quoted is necessarily absolutely authoritative, because I think that would be putting its credentials too high; but, still, it is the fact that you argued in that sense, and the Royal Commission said, on page 236, &quot; We consider it essential that there should be,, as there always have been hitherto, considerable variations in the-rates of wages in tho several districts, but we are strongly of the opinion that national wage agreements should continue.&quot;   Now, in the face of this declaration, the Mining Association withdrew from the position which they had taken up in giving evidence before the Commission, and at your meeting with the men on the 31st March you will permit me to quote your words you said : &quot; I say quite frankly that we are making a sacrifice of our conviction, which is not a thing to boast about or to take any credit for, from that point of view.     But we are not going to stand on the ground which we have taken up in the past in regard to this matter,, and we are prepared, in order that we may get on with the real problem that faces us, to sit down with you and to carry on negotiations on a national basis, upon general principles, and upon such things as are of general application to the industry, . and to enter into a national agreement with you on the same lines.&quot; Later on in the same meeting you said, Mr. Evan Williams :  &apos;&apos; If we had any desire or intention at all, either to break up, or even to weaken the influence of the Miners&apos; Federation, we should not have been doing what we have done to-day sitting down with you to consider this question nationally and telling you what you probably did not expect to hear, that, notwithstanding what we said to the Commis-sion, we are prepared to negotiate a national agreement with you between the Miners&apos; Federation and the Mining Association.&quot;On the 13th April you met again and reaffirmed your position in the following words :  
&quot; We have said that we are prepared to discuss and arrange with you a national agreement. Wre are prepared to do that, and to determine the principles upon which tho ascertainments of wages should he made in the different districts, and that all that is necessary to enable those ascertainments to be made should be determined on a national basis as between you and us on lines similar to those which have been in operation in the past, with the one qualification which we have put to you, and which is, I think you must agree, inevitable, that a national minimum is no longer possible.&apos;&apos;That would probably mean &quot;a national uniform minimum is no longer possible.&quot; Finally, on the 22nd April, the last meeting that took place before the stoppage, you went so far as to put before the men the draft of a national agreement, and in handing .this draft to Mr. Herbert Smith you said:  &quot; Mr. Smith and gentlemen, as we indicated to you at -our last meeting, that we were prepared to discuss with you the terms of  a  national   agreement, we  proceeded   at the earliest opportunity to get into shape proposals in a definite form, insofar as its main lines are concerned, at any rate, for the agreement which, in our view, should be made as between the Miners&apos; Federation and the Mining Association. We had this submitted in draft to our districts last week, and yesterday we were in a position to send to you, in a form approved by the districts, the proposals which we make in regard to it.   I do not know whether the better procedure would not be to go through the agreement in detail and to discuss its clauses as we proceed, so that we may have your views upon them and so that you may have our explanations insofar as they are necessary.&quot; Up to the date, therefore, when the general strike and the national coal stoppage begin, it is perfectly clear, and I am sure it will not be disputed between us, that the owners&apos; position was that, although they disliked the idea of a national agreement, they were prepared to enter into one.   It is now necessary to turn to the proceedings which took place after the stoppage had begun.   You had an interview with the Prime Minister and other Ministers on the 14th May at which you pressed strongly for the introduction of an Eight Hours Bill.   You have told the miners, when you met them on the last occasion-and I do not complain about it at all that you strongly advocated this and used every argument you commanded to impress upon the Government the importance to the industry of imparting   to   it  that   elasticity   which   a lengthening of hours in certain circumstances could alone give and the Prime Minister and his colleagues were impressed with the arguments which were put forward and also as a result of their
278own enquiries and the advice which they received from their highly skilled technical experts.   At this meeting on the 14th May when the Eight Hours Bill was under discussion you gave no indication to us of any change in your attitude as defined in the quotations I have read out.   On the contrary you said, &quot; As to the basis of negotiations we are quite prepared to meet the Miners&apos; Federa-tion at any time on a perfectly open situation.&quot;   That is a very good phrase, &quot; a perfectly open situation.&quot;   It is what I have in my mind and what I am asking you to do to-day.   The next thing that happened was the issue two or three days later of the Government proposals for a settlement.   Comprised in these proposals was the suggestion that a national board should &quot; frame a national wage and hours agreement.&quot;   To this your Association sent in a long   elaborate   and   argumentative   written   reply, but it contained no specific comment or demurrer on this point. Then we come to the 21st May, and you defined the position, in an interview with the Minister of Labour, in the following words : &quot; I want to make this quite clear.   It may not be very palatable, but I think it only right that I should tell you exactly how we feel in this matter.   The Mining Association, as such, as you know, has no powers to deal   with   wages questions except at the direct request of the district associa-tions, and all that it is necessary for the districts to do, or oven one district to do to prevent any negotiations being carried on centrally is to say   that   they   withdraw   their authority to the Mining Association to deal with the matter for them.   We hold the same view as we have always done, that as long as there is a national body on the owners&apos; side and a national bod;/ on tho men&apos;s side dealing with questions of wages, so long will it be difficult to keep wage questions in the industry out of the political arena, and the greatest safeguard that could be brought about   for   peace   in   the industry and for a real settlement of the whole   of   these questions is to get away from national settlements altogether and leave each district to deal with the question for itself. It may bo that there is a line which may have to be taken in this matter.   I am not suggesting in any way that that is the position that we want to take up at the present moment, but rather than have any question of having terms imposed upon us from outside . . .&quot; Evidently you were subjected to some, argumentative pressure from the Government at that moment &quot; I feel perfectly certain that that is the lino of action which the district associations would take in regard to this matter.&quot;Now that, I think, was intended and was interpreted as a warning, perhaps even more than a warning, a veiled threat, that if the.
Government interfered too much with the freedom of negotiations between the parties, the Mining Association would have to depart from their attitude towards national negotiations and insist on district negotiations only, but it is also a clear proof that at that date, 21st May, they were still willing to negotiate nationally and implied an assurance that in the absence of such interference by the Government such as they deprecated that would continue to be their attitude. Now that was the position when the Eight Hours Bill was introduced and, as you know, it was a very serious ihing for his Majesty&apos;s Government to introduce a measure facilitating the lengthening the hours of labour in coal mines. It undoubtedly is a step which is greatly resented by large masses of the industrial population, a step which was bound to be represented as part of a regular scheme and a policy of lengthening hours. We arrived at the conclusion that it was necessary and right after careful consideration, but many of us, most of us I think I may say, were very much inclined to insert in the Bill a series of conditions under which the facility of working the extra hour could be permitted, and we had a discussion with you, which was animated, on that point. You strongly argued against the insertion of any limiting condition and we considered the matter among ourselves and came to the conclusion that if you were willing to give us certain assurances in general terms we would waive the question of inserting those conditions. Then the Prime Minister made a statement, in introducing the Eight Hours Bill, which is reported in Hansard, stating that there would be offers on a district basis which would amount to all that the industry could possibly pay at that time and which would be very much better offers than would be possible on the seven hours basis, and so forth, but the statement ended with the follow sentence : &quot; In any case under the proposals already made by the owners they could not in any district fall below the 1921 minimum which the owners point out, having regard to the change in the cost of living, would now give a real wage 30 per cent, higher than at the time when it was agreed to, five years ago, and would meet the miners&apos; desire for a national settlement.&quot; Now wo shall not get into any dispute about personal good faith, or anything like that put that entirely outside the discussion but we did understand that you had agreed to those words beforehand. In any case there can be no question that after those words were published we received no protest of any kind from you. Many of j^our most prominent members were in the House when the Prime Minister used those words, and those words were never the subject of any sort of adverse comment from you. The matter was dealt with entirely as a reproduction, as you might say, of a passage -which had been submitted to you. Now take the whole of this chain of quotations and facts I am not making the
279slightest reproach against you you will see, if you put yourselves in our position, that we, as Ministers of the Crown, were justified in our belief that at the time we introduced the Mines Eight Hours Bill there was no question of departing from the negotiation of a national agreement. Now let me say this. We were quite in favour of district agreements. AVe are still, if they can be arrived at, and we were very glad that you were going to negotiate in the districts, if you could arrive at agreements in that way, but we never contemplated for one moment that opening the district settlements door meant shutting the door to a national settlement. We wished both doors to be open and for settlements to advance through whichever one could most expeditiously be approached.I must, on behalf of his Majesty&apos;s Government, record the fact that it was our perfectly clear impression that both these doors were open,, and that peace could be reached through either of them. I am quite sure of this, that if we had known that, following the passage of the Eight Hours Bill into law, a new obstacle to a settlement, a new complication, would arise through the closing of one of those doors to peace, we never should have passed the Bill or proceeded with it; therefore, if you take up the attitude that you have now no more power to negotiate,, and that there can be no national negotiations of any kind, if you take up that non possumus attitude, while I am not for a moment making a charge of breach of faith, I do think you will see that we shall have been placed in a position which is, from our point of view, at any rate, extremely unfortunate, and even,, as it might be thought, unfair and that, I know, will weigh with you perhaps more than any other argument that I am going to use.Now let me just touch on a point which requires a little blunt speaking.The most important and specific of these quotations which I have read from your speeches were before the stoppage began, and of course it stands to reason that in the hope of averting a great misfortune like that everything is offered,, even things that one does not think desirable are offered, if they can possibly be the means of staving off the catastrophe. But when for IS weeks the country has been thrown into its present condition, and when you gentlemen, as I know well, have been suffering in a very formidable manner losses perhaps of  600,000, or even  700,000 a week, in keeping the pits from falling to pieces and being flooded; when peace has not been secured, I am quite prepared to say that a new situation arises. If two States are negotiating and then they go to war, it is idle to suppose that negotiations can be taken up after a prolonged campaign at the point at which they left off. That is perfectly clear, but the issue to-day is whether there shall be national negotiations or not
 the issue whether the national negotiation door shall be closed or open. that issue does not depend on your relations with the men with those i do not wish to deal at this moment at all. i wish to establish, by reasonable argument, that there is a relation-ship between yourselves and the government; that it is on the point &apos;cf your relations with the government that i earnestly ask you to consider very carefully what your attitude should be in regard to our formal, deliberate request that you should come with us and meet the men in an open, unprejudiced discussion.now, i have to say a word about the men. naturally, i am not here to- speak for them or to give any guarantee on their behalf. i do not know how far they are prepared to go; that we can only ascertain when we come to closer quarters, but his majesty&apos;s government required, after the many futile negotiations which have been attempted, some evidence which was satisfactory to us that the miners&apos; federation had made a definite change of spirit, and that they were earnestly desirous of making a peaceful and lasting settlement. now, i am not going to give a guarantee, i am in no position to do so; but, honestly, i believe there has been a change of heart and that there is a wish, an earnest wish, for peace, and that there is a willingness to discuss on the merits, with a sincere desire to secure the greatest benefits for all concerned, every aspect of this question. now, in the letter which they have written to us there occurs this expression, &quot; a reduction in labour costs.&quot; that expression has evidently been very carefully chosen because it is what, to use a homely term, i might call a &quot;portmanteau&quot; expression it covers everything; it is chosen because it covers everything. it covers wages, it covers hours, it covers reorganisation, and it was chosen deliberately.that, i think, indicates a very distinct alteration in the position that was disclosed even at your last meeting with the men, and on that it seems to me that we are bound and i trust that you will also feel a similar obligation to come to closer quarters with the matter, to hear what is said under the most favourable circumstances, under an impartial chairmanship, on both sides, and to sec what practical steps can be taken to terminate this stoppage.naturally, i have not gone so far in this matter with my colleagues without having considered the second steps which, at the proper time, the government will be prepared to sivggest; but this would only complicate the issue now. you should not suppose, however, that we are pushing forward in this matter without having seen some distance ahead along the various alternative courses which may be forced upon us or which may be open to us.to sum up, i ask you to address yourselves to the perfectly simple question, is there to be any national agreement at all, or is the industry in  future to be regulated purely by district
agreement without any national wage negotiating body ? Secondly, Will you meet us with the men, being properly authorised and retaining your perfect freedom to refuse any unreasonable proposition or to break off the negotiations if it is found there is no change of heart, and no desire to reach a settlement? Will j&apos;ou meet us with the men and let us see what are the practical steps, by national discussion and by district discussion, for both will unquestionably be necessary, to bring this trouble to an end? And on behalf of his Majesty&apos;s Government, with whom you have been so long in close and amicable discussion and negotiation, who are after all the trustees of the public as a whole, on their behalf 1 most earnestly venture to express the hope that you will defer to our wishes.Mr. Evan Williams : You have a considerable advantage over me in this discussion this afternoon in that you knew, having prepared it, what you were going to say, and I have to reply only after hearing what you have said.Mr. Chuechill : Would you like to withdraw for a few minutes ?Mr. Evan Williams : I do not think there is any necessity.I agree with you that there is only one issue that is open for discussion between us this afternoon, and that is as to whether or not the Mining Association is prepared to enter into negotia-tions with the Miners&apos; Federation to set up a national agreement. To put this in its true aspect it is this, as to whether the coal owners of the country are prepared to authorise the Mining Association to enter into negotiations with the miners, with the Government standing by and taking part in the discussions, not that the question would assume any different phase at all whether the Government does or does not come in in this particular matter. I think I must, even at the cost of repeating what has been said many times before, say what the position of the Mining Association is in regard to questions of this kind and what its position is as between itself and the coal owners who, after all, compose it through their district associations in general. The Mining Association has been in existence for a large number of years,, since 1854. It was set up to deal with questions of legislation, of questions affecting the owners of the collieries throughout the country which did not affect their relations between themselves and the men they employed. Up to 1919 there was no definite constitution that would be a constitution for the Mining Associa-tion. In 1919 a new constitution was established of which I believe the Mines Department generally have knowledge, and in that agreement it is specifically laid down that the Mining Association shall not have any power or authority to deal with
wages questions affecting any district except at the direct request of that particular district.   That clearly debarred  the  Mining Association from dealing with wages questions at all except by the direct request and unanimous consent of every district associa-tion of the country forming it.   When the war came and the mines were taken under control, questions arose affecting all sorts of things concerning the collieries, and it was necessary, as the industry was treated as a whole under the control of the Govem-ment, that there should be some body with which the Government could be in touch and make such arrangements as were called for for the regulation of the multitude of matters, which required consideration and decisions, among them questions of wages.   The Mining Association, being in existence for other purposes, was the only body available at the time, and without any questions at all in the emergency which existed the district associations agreed at once that it should deal with any questions as between it and the Government relating to the industry; the industry had been treated as a whole by the Government and there was no choice for the coal owners except to fall in with the position which had been created and agree to all questions that were put to it as affecting the industry being put through the only body which was in existence.   It was after the war that the new constitution was arranged, but the mines were still under control, and it was definitely the view to put an end to all national arrangements of this kind at the earliest possible moment, and with one voice the coal owners of the country insisted upon having such a clause as I have mentioned inserted in this   constitution.   Obviously, during the time the industry was under control it could not get away from dealing with matters on a national basis, and when we came to 1921 there were so many questions involving so much difficulty that had to be dealt with that it was obviously impracticable-cable at that moment to resolve the problem of the coal industry into its component parts district by district, and the coal owners agreed that for the time being it was inevitable that they should continue to be dealt with on a national basis, to some extent to have general principles laid down and have a national board set up to deal with the many questions which cropped   up   on decontrol and on the formulation of a new basis for the regulation of wages in the industry.   The basis was new to every district in the country.   As a matter of fact, I think it was necessary perhaps at that time to have an over-riding national board which was to deal with questions which arose under and out of the new method of dealing with the industry.   It is no secret that at the backs of their minds the coal owners felt that as soon as this new method, this new scheme, of regulating wages had been formally established there would no longer be any necessity in the industry for a national supervision of any kind at all, and there has been
no disguise right through of their desire at the earliest possible moment to get away from national agreements and back to those district agreements which prior to the war had been the regular method of dealing with wages in the industry and which had brought about prosperity in the industry to both the owners and the men. It was the miners who put an end to the 1921 agreement at a time when there was a Labour Government in power, and a crisis was brought about through the national determination of the whole of the wage arrangements in the country at the same time by the Miners&apos; Federation in the early months of 1924. At that time, the feeling in the districts against a continuance of the national agreement was exceedingly strong, and it was only the very extreme pressure which was put upon the coal owners of the country through the Mining Association that led to the mine owners, to avoid a crisis similar to that which we have gone through and are going through, to accept the position and make a new national agreement with the miners and to continue for a period, which was limited to 12 months, this arrangement of dealing with questions through a national board in so far as they concerned general treatment and through the districts themselves as to the details of the actual arrangements to be made. It was with the greatest difficulty, as I said, that the coal owners were got to see that at that time force of circumstances was so great that the risk of the country of being held up in this way was so great, at a time when we were emerging from a period of temporary and quite accidental disturbance, that, as I say, we entered into an agreement the terms of which we distinctly stated at that time were, in our opinion, certain to prove disastrous to the industry and which, as a matter of fact, bore out everything and even more of those things that we prophesied for it when the agreement was made. The experience we had of national agreements up to that time, during the course of that year, produced such unanimity of feeling among coal owners that they must, in the interest of peace and prosperity in the industry, revert to their old methods of settling their affairs district by-district between those people who knew completely what they were dealing with and through people who had to carry out such agreements as they were dealing with, that they determined that no further national agreements would be entered into on their behalf by any body for them, and, as I have said, the view that was put to the Royal Commission on this particular point was on the lines that I have just indicated. The Commission did not accept the view that we put forward, and I submit that it was not altogether on the merits of the question that they came to this conclusion, but, being human, they could not be blind to the position that would arise with the Miners&apos; Federation if they
&quot;accepted the owners&apos; view on a point to which the Miners&apos; Federa-tion very naturally attached so very much importance.Then we come to the point at which the Government and the owners and the men had to consider the report of the Commission. We were faced with a position, at the end of April, when all arrangements between the Government and the industry came to an end. There had been no national agreement in existence between the owners and the men from the 31st July, 1925, up to that time. We were in the position of having no national agreement with the men, we were faced with a crisis in the industry, the Government felt the seriousness of it quite as much as we did, and in order to avert the disaster which has happened the Government decided to accept a good many things which they themselves said were objectionable to their principles, and the owners as well said that the lead the Government had given could not but be followed by them in the hope and the very sincere desire of trying to avert what has happened. I do not think we should be, I will not say &quot; taunted,&quot; because we did not do it in that form, that it should be held up as an argument against us at the present moment that we swallowed a good many things which were very distasteful to us in the hope that we might thereby avert this general stoppage of work in this industry, and also the general strike, which was clearly threatened at the time we were discussing this question, and that with a feeling that we could not very well stand up before the country and say that though a national agreement may prevent this terrible thing happening we are not going to have a national agreement which followed our predictions. We agreed to continue with the Miners&apos; Federation some form I am wrong when I say we should continue,&quot; that we should re-establish some form of national agreement to regulate certain general questions in the industry in future. It has got to be borne in mind that we have been pressed, not only by the Miners&apos; Federation, but by the Government, through the Mines Department, to enter into a national agreement covering the period during which the subsidy was to be paid, but we steadfastly and absolutely refused to do anything of the kind. In order, as I have said, to try to avert this calamity, we agreed to offer a national agreement the terms of which were simply refused by the Miners&apos; Federation. Under pressure from the Government we went further and said that for an eight hour day, a universal uniform eight hour day, we would be prepared to insert in that agreement a uniform national minimum, and I think it is only right that I should quote what the Prime Minister himself said to us at that time, on the 30th April, when we announced our decision, which had been brought about with very great difficulty, with very great misgivings and reluctance
2amongst the coal owners. On the eve of the 1st May the Prime Minister said in this room:  &quot; First of all, Mr. Evan Williams, I do want to thank you for the trouble you have given to this. I do recognise that you have made an enormous effort, and I think that a good many members of your association have come a long way, and I do warit to say that I think you have done a great deal to help things. That, I think, is only fair to you, and it is the truth.&quot;It is a recognition on the part of the Prime Minister at that time of the difficulties which we had had to face and of the efforts which we had made to overcome those difficulties so that nothing we could do on our part at that time could be said to have stood in the way of averting the general strike which followed upon the stoppage of work in the industry. And right through from that, right on I think, we have met the Government fairly and reasonably in everything that has been asked of us, up to the time when the Eight Hours Bill was introduced in the House of Commons. I do want to make this perfectly clear, that even on the 30th April, when a national agreement, or a national minimum was offered, it was conditional upon a uniform eight hour day throughout the whole of the industry.Mr. Churchill : You mean not that a national agreement was conditional upon a uniform eight hour day throughout the industry, but the 1921 minimum percentage ?Mr. Evan Willams : Specifically that, but coupled with it  you see, we had told the Prime Minister quite definitely, and 1 may say the Prime Minister did not demur that there was no possibility of re-establishing the industry on sound economic lines except by an eight hour day. I do not think there was any question at all about it.Mr. Churchill : We certainly thought, we still think, that the principle of some extension of hours is a necessary feature of any settlement which will meet the present conditions. We have not the slightest reason to depart from our conviction that that is the right and proper thing to do, but we certainly assumed that you were not going to close the door to national negotiations that would have made no difference.Mr. Evan Williams : I am perfectly certain of this, that neither the Government nor the majority in the House of Commons who passed this would have made it law if they were not convinced it was absolutely necessary.
Mr. Churchill : Do you mean to say that if the House of Commons had been informed that when this had been introduced the owners were going back on the whole of their position on national negotiations-Mr. Evan Williams : I have not come to that yet. There were meetings, the verbatim notes of some of which you have quoted, which took place right up to the 14th May, up to the point at which the Government made definite proposals to both sides, proposals which wore rejected by both sides. The Government definitely declared at that time, on the 21st May, that it was free from all the offers which it had made and had a perfectly free hand and was not committed to anything. The Government did make that announcement to the Miners&apos; Federation. We had marched step by step with the Government up to that point. I think we had done, up to that point, everything that the Government had pressed us to do. I do not think there can be any question about that, and when the Government, which had taken a very active part in the discussions which had taken place and in such negotiations as had taken place up to that time, declared themselves free from all their offers and no longer bound in any way by any of the proposals which had been made by them, they cannot expect that the same freedom was not accorded to the other two parties at the same time.Mr. Churchill : No; I make no reproach about that; it is the relationship between the Mining Association and his Majesty&apos;s Government on which I rest, because, as I say, if you were going to make so great a departure and change from the basis on which matters had been proceeding, we ought to have been told specifically that you were going to do so, in the clearest possible way, before we met your strong &apos;wish that you had publicly expressed that we should pass the Eight Hours Bill. You should have said : &quot; Clearly understand that, when you have passed that Bill, we are going to shut the door on the idea of a national settlement.&quot;Mr. Evan Williams : You have rather anticipated the point I want to deal with. That is, on the 21st May. There was an interval during which nothing took place, no negotiations between the Government and the Mining Association, until we come to some time towards the end of June when, as the result of representations and arguments which we put forward, the Government began to consider seriously the question of an eight-hour day. We entered then upon a new phase, and I defy anybody to say that during those new negotiations, from the end of June and right on until July, until the Eight Hours Bill became law, there was any suggestion from the Government that this was conditional
upon a national&apos; agreement, or any suggestion at all that there should be anything but separate district offers made by the coal owners&apos; associations throughout tho districts, determined on an eight hour basis.mr. churchill : i cannot possibly accept that. the assumption on which we proceeded was that district negotiations would be undertaken, but that, of course, there was no narrowing of the possibilities of peace, and, if there had been, the initiative in announcing them should have come from you, because you were changing the basis on which we were acting and therefore you should have informed us that you were changing that basis. we assumed the basis remained the same unless we were informed of a change. .mr. evan williams : we were starting upon an entirely new basis a basis which gave freedom to the districts to make new offers in an entirely new condition of things. in our reply to you on the 14th may we said that we indicated the action we were prepared to take with a view to giving effect, as far as possible, to the objects aimed at in the royal commission^ recommendations if a settlement could thereby be reached without a stoppage of work. (that was on the 14th may.) these negotiations broke down. then there was a period during which nothing took place between us until we began to talk about eight hours. i do not know what may have been at the backs of the minds of the government. if they had that condition at the back of their minds they never mentioned it to us. we had no indication of any kind at all that the introduction of an eight hours bill in the house of commons was to be conditional upon a national settlement. they urged us very strongly, and one of the meetings to which you referred at which some feeling was developed was on the very point that we had not put forward, these separate district offers on the eight hour basis, by the time we were going to.mr. churchill : it was on the point of delay in putting forward the proposals.mr. evan williams : on the point of the delay in putting forward those offers, the offers on the eight hour basis, and we told you quite clearly they had to be considered by each district separately. each district had to make up its mind what was the very best it could offer on the eight hour basis, without any reference at all to any other district. that was the whole basis upon which these discussions between us took place, that offers on the eight hour basis were put forward absolutely independently by districts without any suggestion of any kind that there was an overriding or collateral national settlement.
ismr. churchill : but you see, mr. williams, where two parties are in relation, whoever makes the change in the general basis must declare it, and at the moment when the government were taking action, on its merits i admit, but action for which you had most strongly pressed, in passing this bill; if at that moment you were all the time contemplating making a change in the basis you should immediately have said: &quot;we are going to depart from our principle and all previous declarations are null, and we shall not entertain national negotiations.&quot; you should not have let a thing like that pass silently.mr. evan williams : it did not pass, by any means, silently. the district associations, each one of them, made proposals. that was made known to the government. we kept the government aware of every step we took.mr. churchill: perfectly true.mr, evan williams : and the only thing that was ccntem-plated between the two sides at that time was that there should be definite offers made, district by district, settled by each district without reference to any national body or any other body.sir a. steel-maitland : may i interrupt for one moment. i would like to say a word about this. the fact that the districts were making their offers and having their negotiations, from our point of view, was not incompatible with the national agreement. i think there must be some misunderstanding, but i will deal with that afterwards.mr. evan williams : there was no suggestion of any sort or kind; there was no mention of a national agreement.mr. churchill : it is mentioned in the very words the prime minister used in his speech.mr. evan avilliams : it did not occur to me when i read those words that there was any very serious collision of opinion. the only construction to be put upon the prime ministers words is  &quot; now you have obtained in these district offers minima, each one of which is not less than 20 per cent., conditional upon its district circumstances being adjusted. plaving obtained that 20 per cent, minimum in each of the individual districts, your aspiration for a national settlement is fully met without there being a national agreement. the substance is there without the form.&quot; that is the only construction which I think wo may put upon the prime ministers words. it has met the desire of the miners for a national settlement, and if the desire of tho miners for a national
2settlement has been met in that way, what further question is there of a national agreement? there is no further question and there never was during the whole of that time, no suggestion from you that there should be an eight hours bill conditional upon a national agreement. there was no talk of a national settlement. the whole discussions took place upon the basis of there being separate district offers made by the district associations on certain lines, and when those were made, national agreements were not necessary. these offers were made, you know perfectly well, with the direct object and hope that in each district separately there would be a return to work. i think it was perfectly clearly indicated to you, as far as the midland counties were concerned, where there was no reduction of wages, where there was in some cases even a higher minimum offer than the 20 per cent., that in those districts there would be, first of all, a return to work and the return would spread piecemeal throughout the country. it was clearly understood between us that there was no question of a general resumption of work simultaneously, that it would be district by district.mr. churchill : that is perfectly true, by way of district settlement.mr. evan williams : if that is so, how can you say you understood that the question of a national settlement was still open? if these districts made offers and these oilers were accepted, one by one, then a national agreement goes overboard altogether. that was the only interpretation that could be put upon the whole of those negotiations.mr. churchill : not at all. there were two doors, and we were perfectly ready to reach a settlement through the district door if there was no possibility of reaching a settlement through the national door, but no one ever intended or contemplated that the national door would be closed and that the district door should fail to open.mr. evan williams : i say quite definitely that in our opinion the national door had been closed and the only door that was open at that time was the district door, and it was to open those district doors that we were urged and we agreed to make those district offers, one by one.&quot;we were urged to make these offers as high as possible, differing district by district, in order to get the resumption of work in detail throughout the country. how can you reconcile that with a statement that at that time you were still expecting a national settlement? it is contrary to the facts, i say definitely it is contrary to the whole of the facts.
The important question is, however, not as to whether an under-standing existed or did not exist between the Government and the employers. The real question is what is the position of the Mining Association, and what are the merits of a national settlement.Mr. Churchill : I submitted it to you as an argument to show that in the opinion of his Majesty&apos;s Government a national sattle-ment was not barred, though district settlements were being attempted, and that was our honest impression, and you singularly failed to undeceive us at the moment we introduced tho Eight Hours Bill. I do not put the point at more than that, but I take the chain of statements which you made and say it was a natural and reasonable assumption for us to make that while we knew you were going ahead to make district settlements, yet at the same time no door to peace was closed, and if we had known that the introduction of the Eight Hours Bill would synchronise with a decision on your part the moment you got it to close the national door, never should we have allowed ourselves to be placed in that position. It was due to us that you should tell us you were going to make that change at that moment.Mr. Evan Williams : I say definitely there was no suggestion of a national settlement; everything pointed to the contrary. We were urged to make offers, district by district; the only common element in those district offers were the Eight Hours and the 20 per cent, minimum, and they did not synchronise with the passing of the Bill. It was all preliminary to the passing of the Bill. I should have said there was no minimum less than 20 per cent.; the 20 per cent, was a minimum of the district minima. There could not have been a national settlement in the minds of either you or ourselves at a time when we were being urged, if possible, to give a higher minimum than 20 in those districts which could put it forward, and in order to bring about tho very thing which a national settlement could not have brought about, that is to say, a break away piecemeal district by district.A general resumption of work simultaneously throughout the country was impossible and the only way to settle this strike was to do it in detail and got it settled district by district, and in that way once there had been a considerable number of districts with a resumption of work on a tolerably large scale the remainder of the district would very soon follow. From that time forward there has been no suggestion by the Government to us, and certainly no word from us to the Government, in the contrary direction.Mr. Chubchill : Pardon me, we never knew you had taken this step until you met the men on the 19th August, and then you wrote a letter to the Minister of Mines shortly after the interview

285we had with the miners the week before last, immediately then we drew your attention to it.mr. evan williams : i say there was no necessity for any intimation in a formal way. the whole of the discussions- and i repeat this again prior to the introduction of the eight hours bill had been on a district basis, with which a national agreement was incompatible. then nothing more transpired until we got a request from the men to meet them. i say the government were aware, before that meeting was held, that we were going to say definitely to the men that no national settlement was possible, no national discussions could take place, and after the meeting was held on the 19th august a whole week elapsed with no suggestion from the government in any shape or form. it was only when i read the verbatim notes of your interview with the miners&apos; federation on the 26th that i felt that the position which the owners had taken up, of which the government were fully aware and were an assenting party to, was being changed, that i wrote the letter to col. lane-fox. 1 say quite emphatically that so far from there being a change of front at the end of last month, the 19th august, between us and the government or between us and the men, everything that was said at that time was consistent with the whole of the transactions between the govern-ment and the mine owners right back to the two or three weeks preceding the passing of the eight hours bill.coming now to the actual situation the position is, as has been distinctly stated to you, the mining association has no authority to enter into any negotiations with the miners&apos; federa-tion, and that position arises out of the constitution of the mining association, under which it is only by direct requests from each and every one of the districts that the mining associa-tion could be endowed with any power or authority to make this agreement. i ought to say that there are districts in the country which have withdrawn from the mining association, and the mining association does not represent in any shape or form the whole of the country at the present time,, and i may say that it is the fact that the mining association entered into such a disastrous agreement with the miners&apos; federation in june 1924 that has caused these districts to give up their membership of the association. so strong is the feeling on the merits of the position in these districts that i say definitely that it is not possible for those districts to so change their minds, no matter what may be the position, as to give the association power and authority to meet the miners&apos; federation and discuss, matters, and a meeting held between the mining association and the miners&apos; federation in those circumstances would not be honest because all they could say to them if they met them would be : &quot; we are
very sorry, our position is exactly the same as it was when we met you last on 19th August, and we cannot enter into any nego-tiations.&quot;   I do want to make this perfectly clear, that there is no desire on the part of the Mining Association, or on the part of the coal owners of the country, to break up the Miners&apos; Federa-tion.    Nothing is further from our thoughts.   It existed before the war.   The Mining Association had dealings with it before the war on many occasions.   In 1911 we sat for weeks considering the details of the Mines Acts, which were then brought forward.   We have never refused, and we shall not refuse, to meet them upon any general questions affecting the safety, health or welfare of the miners, or of those engaged in the mines.   We are prepared to meet them upon any question of general importance of that kind, but the question of the   wages   arrangements,   the  terms   and conditions of  employment of the worker with his own colliery company is a matter which cannot be dealt with except in the districts by those who know the conditions in the districts, and by those who are to carry out the arrangements when they are made.As I said, it was with the greatest reluctance that we had at  any time  entered   upon   national  agreements  and  national negotiations.   It is the experience which we in the country have had of those agreements that has strengthened us so much in the view that we put forward, that we say quite definitely and emphatieallj&apos; that the Mining Association will not enter into negotiations with the Miners&apos; Federation on this point.   What has been the position?  There has never been peace in this industry since we had national agreements since the industry has been dealt with on a national basis.   If you look up the Ministry of Labour figures you will find that, in the 22 years prior to the war, the only ones for which the Ministry of Labour have particulars, there was an average loss of time in the industry through disputes of 5-30 days per person per annum.   In the years during which there have been national arrangements there have been losses per man per annum, including this year up to the end of August, of 23-36 days per annum, and if you exclude this year, the whole of 1926, there have been losses of over 12 days per man per annum through disputes, which shows clearly what a change there has been in the number of days lost in that way.  We have been faced with crisis after crisis whenever an agreement has come to an end. In 1924 we were faced with a crisis through a national settlement, and  it  was only  averted  by   the   owners  giving way  to the representatives of the Labour Government of that day.   In 1925 there  was   another  crisis,   and   that   was only  settled by the Government giving way to the threats of the miners.   In 1926 a similar position was brought about which was not averted because neither the Government nor the owners gave way.   As certain as there is a national agreement which brings all the districts of the
2?i*J Iscountry under one arrangement, so certain will there be crises of that character, and looking not only at the interests of the coal owners themselves, but the industry as a whole and the country as a whole, we feel that we should be acting most detrimentally to the community as a whole if we again entered into an arrangement which inevitably makes every industrial question in the mining industry a political issue. The very things that are happening this week-end and to - day are in themselves proofs of the undesirable character of national agreements. If it had not been for the question of national agreements, does anyone suppose there would have been a stoppage in Cannock Chase, Notts, Derby and Leicester, where the men were not asked to accept any reduction of wages at all? The effect of a national agreement has been to bring about a stoppage even where there is no dispute as regards wages between the owners and the men. I say it is a political issue pure and simple, and the moment you have set up a national agreement with a national board you bring every question that is relevant to that board forward as a political issue, with debates in the House of Commons, and you get the Government involved and you put the industry as a whole on a different plane from every other industry, and such accusations as have been made that there are troubles in the coal industry and that they are more numerous and more bitter than in any other industry of the country are due solely and entirely to the fact that they are dealt with on a national basis and not on a district basis. It gives the opportunity to direct national strikes not against the industry or the owners, but against the whole community, and I should have thought the experience we have had since April of this year ought to be enough to convince the Government and the whole country that the sooner it gets away from these national arrangements in this or any other industry the better for the country. It may be thought that by entering into discussions with the Miners&apos; Federation in some way we should solve this problem. We hold the contrary view absolutely. There are districts where the owners&apos; offer has been accepted without reference in any way at ali to national agreements. That movement is spreading rapidly. Even to-day, which is a Monday and not the kind of day on which large resumptions of work generally take place, there are in those three districts of Notts and Derby, Warwick and Cannock Chase, over 2,750 more men at work than on Friday.Mr. Churchill : Perfectly clearly, the discussions that we have been having have not deterred men from returning because the largest returns have been since the peace discussions have been reopened. .Mr. Evan Williams : No. The rate of increase was itself progressive up to Friday.   To-da3&apos; it has dropped.
Mr. Ceukchill : I thought a moment ago you were rather heartened by what had taken place.Mr. Evan Williams : No, I was going to say that in spite of this there have been resumptions of work on an increased scale, and while resumptions may continue to increase in those districts where it has started, it is quite certain they will not begin in those districts which would have had resumptions on a considerable scale by this time. I say that even if the refusal of the Mining Association were to prolong the strike which I think is not going to be the case it is in the interests of the country in the long run that it should get away from these national arrangements which have held the country to ransom over and over again, and will continue to do so so long as they exist. &quot;You have said of the miners that there is evidence of a change of heart. That was on Friday, as the result of a meeting which they held probably on Thursday. But on Saturday there is an article by Mr. Cook in The Miner, in leaded type:- &quot; Neither I nor my colleagues will sign any agreement for longer hours. On that question or on the question of a national settlement there can be no compromise.&quot;I say solemnly with conviction that I regard this move on the part of the Miners&apos; Federation not as a movement in the direction of peace in the industry, but as a deliberate attempt to create difficulty between the coal owners and the Prime Minister.Sir A. Steel-Maitland : May I put one or two points? I am not going to go over the past. I do not think we get any further by going over the past. It has been put on the record, and any further discussion about the past really only tends to obscure the position as regards the future. Let me put one or two considerations to you from our point of view, and this is not going into past history, except just to say that we quite appreciate you were willing to take things in the past, just as the Government were willing to take things in the past, for the sake of preserving peace, before peace was broken, because you said you went step by step with us in trying to accept things which you did not like in themselves in order to preserve peace, and we acknowledge that at once. Now the real question is to get peace again and to get peace again on a lasting basis. I am sure you will agree with that. That is what we really want to get. Peace under such conditions that you can have a lasting peace afterwards. That was one of the reasons why we brought in that Eight Hours Bill. We thought that on real economic grounds it was wise and right to allow the possibility of a longer working day, and that, if there was not that possibility, we would not be likely to be able to get peace in the coal industry, a lasting
peace. That was the reason why we did it, and that is the reason why we faced the difficult3&apos; which we knew was perfectly inevitable as a result. It is a question now of whether you will go step by ste2n and face facts in themselves in order to get peace, a lasting peace, and it was with that desire to get a peace that will endure that we took up this position. Do just remember this, that the miners have, without question, at last made a very great advance. They have made a great advance which quite definitely covers matters on which they were never willing to negotiate before. They said we are not willing to negotiate upon wages, and they were even more emphatic about not being willing to negotiate on hours. It is now quite clear that they are willing to negotiate, both on wages and on hours, which they have never been willing to do up to now. We have every reason to believe that they are willing to enter into negotiations from which nothing shall be excluded, neither wages nor hours nor district variations.Mr. Evan Williams : To meet the immediate necessities.Sir A. Steel-Maitland : To meet the immediate necessities of the industry, and that means not waiting for any change until a number of more or less hypothetical matters have come to pass. Now that is really the state of affairs at the moment, and I am sure you also are anxious, as we all are,, that there should be a settlement,, and a settlement with as little further delay and loss, both to the industry and to the people engaged in it and to the country, as is compatible with getting a lasting peace for the industry. Now I agree with you that what one wants is a lasting peace. I sympathise at once and say so quite frankly that if we want to get a lasting peace it will be a right and good thing if the industry is regulated by industrial considerations more than by political considerations, but we for our part do not think that the question of a national agreement in that case should stand in the way. I was very much struck by one phrase that Mr. Evan Williams used. I was struck by it because I think it covered possibilities for the future and indicated that possibly at the present moment the phrase &quot;national agreement&quot; covered ambiguities, and that it might be as well to clear those away. The phrase he used was re-establishing the previous position. Now that meant going back precisely to the same kind of agree-ment as there was in 1924---Mr. Evan W7illiams : No; simply referring to a national agreement at all, without reference to its scope.Sir A. Steel-Maitland : W7hat I would ask you to do is just to get down to the actual facts and to get at the facts which lie beneath the phrase.   That is what is important in the long run.

Steel-Maitland : What I would ask you to do is just to get down to the actual facts and to get at the facts which lie beneath the phrase.   That is what is important in the long run.
The troubles that arose from the former national agreement were in many ways, due to uniform treatment in a national agreement of the whole of the country. In this case what we consider is that a national agreement does not exclude district negotiations, district arrangements, and if you get to that you really remove what seems to me a great deal, if not the whole, of the main objection which you might quite legitimately take. I understand you will be meeting a lot of representatives of districts. I do not know if that is the case. That is what I would ask you to do, to consider when you talk it over with them what really is the substance underneath the question of national agreement. What you want to get surely are arrangements made by districts which have knowledge of the circumstances, the men in which have knowledge of one another. That is really what we want to get,, and not to have a uniform, suit, so to speak, fitted to the varying figures of the varying districts by some central body. If you can get down then to district arrangements and district discussions, I should have imagined that in that case you would have found probably that the word &quot;national agreement&quot; itself took on quite a different meaning, that you would get away from the objections you attach to it, and that that fact need no longer stand in the way of peace. I do not think it ought to interfere, the industry afterwards being more free from what you might call political considerations than would otherwise be the case. I would like just to put this consideration to you. It is not possible, when you have had a particular system in existence for a number of years, to act or to speak as though the slate were quite clear and the previous history had not been written. I should have imagined that from the point of view of political interference there wrould very likely he more political interference if an attempt had been made, even a successful attempt, to try and make a number of district arrangements, simply ignoring the central authorities of both sides altogether. I would suggest that you really get down,, as I say, to the facts underneath, and then I feel I can give you my reasons for it more in detail, but I do not want to take up further time at a meeting of this kind. I feel myself quite convinced, if I were trying to look at it from a business point of view, if I were engaged in the industry, that I should be more likely to get a fair regulation industrially and less trouble afterwards if I got district discussions of arrange-ments, at the same time not sticking to past history as if it had never existed at all, and therefore the need for some form of national agreement could be altogether put into the waste paper basket and thrown on one side. I could develop the reasons in detail, but I do not want to ; I want to suggest to you that from the public point of view, which I know from what Mr. Evan Williams said you have in mind yourselves, you should get down
to the substance,, and i am sure that from that point of view you would find that the question of a national agreement under the new forms or conditions that i very briefly outlined is not really a matter of such substance, and that from the point of view of the industry itself it would be wiser to agree to it than to stand out in opposition.sir laming wouthington-evans : it must be recognised, mr. evan &quot;williams, that the men and their leaders set great store by a national agreement, and at one time, for the purpose of peace, you were willing, although you thought a national agreement was quite unneeessaiw, to have a national agreement. you have told us that already. is it not just as important now to recognise the very strong feeling which animates the men in favour of a national agreement, and do whatever you can do, provided the national agreement does not interfere with district settlements, and does not make the settlement an uneconomic settlement? what you are striving to do, what we are all striving to do, is to get a settlement of this stoppage on economic terms, not on political terms. your objection to the national agreement is largely that you fear that will hold together the nucleus for future trouble on political lines, not on economic lines. is it not possible to conceive a national agreement, either laying down the princi2)les upon which district settlements shall be carried out or else bringing together the district settlements after they have been separately negotiated in the districts, bringing them together and preserving in a national agreement whatever common principles may emerge from those district agreements ? so long as the settlement is on economic lines, surely it does not much matter to you whether it takes the form of separate district agreements linked together so far as the principles are concerned in a national agreement, or whether it takes the form of a whole series of district agreements? it is admitted, i think, on all sides that district settlements are going to vary the one from the other, the conditions of the industry are quite different in the varying districts, so that district negotiation is in any case necessary, but that does not preclude, as it seems to me, a national agreement, and i suggest to you that so long as you keep politics out of the settlement you are not doing any harm to the settlement and you are meeting what you know to be a very very strong feeling on the part of the men&apos;s association.mr. biubgeman : i agree very much with what the secretary of state for war has just said. t have not, as you know, been following as closely what has been happening day by day as many of my colleagues, but it does seem to me that we are really quarrelling over rather a small point. there is no question, i think, in anybody&apos;s mind that district variations are absolutely
necessary, but what is the objection, if those district settlements are made and agreed to on both sides, to getting them in some form which can be ratified by those who represent the men and the owners nationally ?Col. Lane-Fox : You have told us you have no authority to negotiate on this basis, but you have power, of course, to get that authority. Do you think it worth while? You probably might think it worth while if you thought, or agreed in your own minds, that the men were prepared to negotiate both on hours and wages. AVe think they are.Mr. Evan Williams : I want to make it perfectly clear to you that our objection, the objection of the coal owners throughout the country, is not one of form, it is one of substance. The Minister of Labour has spoken of a lasting peace. That is what we want, a lasting peace, and it is because we are convinced that we cannot get a lasting peace that we are so determined. After all, you cannot ignore experience. The man who will not pay attention to history in dealing with the present situation is not doing himself justice, and it is the experience we have had of the cramping effect of a national agreement upon district arrange-ments, of the inevitable effect of dealing with the question as a whole which makes it become a political question and not an industrial question, that causes us to feel so strongly upon this matter. The problem is a district problem, it is a very big problem in many districts, a problem that some districts would have the very greatest difficulty in settling for themselves without any interference at all or any restrictions imposed upon them from an)7 central authority, and to suggest that a district problem which varies so much from district to district can be helped in the very least by negotiations of a national character, in which district considerations cannot be taken into consideration in any shape or form.Sir Laming Wouthington-Evans : The cardinal principle is laid down.Mr. Evan Williams : The principles are already embodied in all the district offers. Can anybody suggest any advantage to the industry or to the country from the superposition, as you put it, of a national agreement upon a series of district agreements which have already been made?Mr. Bkidoeman : WTiat I said was &quot; ratification.&quot;Mr. Evan Williams: How long is it going to take? I have not heard anybody who has been able to point out a single element
of national advantage, of national benefit, I mean from the point of view of the community as a whole, in having national settlements.Mr. Churchill : Surely it would be an advantage if by national negotiations at the present time we ended this terrible dispute and got the men back to work and the industries of the country going. Surely that is our object? What we are here for is to find a way of ending the dispute.Mr. Evan Williams : It is because we feel so confident that anything in the nature of national negotiations, quite apart from merits or demerits, is going to prolong the strike that we are reinforced in our opinion that it would be a national disaster. It is in the interests of the country as a whole that we feel so strongly in this matter.Mr. Biudgeman : Supposing you got district settlements made which were perfectly satisfactory to all of you, to you and to the men, discussed in the districts, they must contain some elements that are common all round. What would you or they lose, or what would anybody lose, by collecting those district arrangements tigether and saying,, &quot; These are made according to what each district can do, and we as a whole ratify them with all their variations.&quot;Mr. Evan Williams: What does anybody gain?Mr. Bridgeman : Peace, probably.Mr. Evan Williams: No; you will have had peace with the district agreements.   What are you going to gain?Mr. Bridgeman : You ratify peace.Mr. Churchill : You may not succeed in making district agreements apart from a national understanding. In June you were confident that district agreements would be made on an eight hour basis, but nothing has occurred, and as long as there is this veto on a national agreement the struggle may go on for weeks.Mr. Evan Williams : I do not want to make any further reference to the Bishops. The jocular remark which I made the other day has been misinterpreted, though it was received with laughter at the time, but I say quite definitely we cannot lay the blame for any of the delay that has taken place on the coal owners; a great deal of blame can be laid on people outside, and I feel quite sure the industry and other industries who support us to the hilt on this point, the big industries of the country  are perfectly confident that the only lasting solution of this
difficulty, and the quickest solution after all, is by dealing with the matter in the districts where the problems are known and where they have to be faced,, whatever might be done in the way of a national preliminary or subsequent national agreement these problems have got to be faced, and the districts feel that they are not going to be hampered by national agreements which may have been entered into before they make these agreements, and they are not going to subject agreements which they may have made locally, and which are satisfactory to both sides, to the veto, or even to the registration, of any other body.Mr. CiiukcjiiiJj : Mr. Williams, I must most earnestly beg you not at this meeting to use language which will preclude you from seeking from your constituent bodies the necessary authority to enable you to meet with us and the Miners&apos; Federation.If you were to take that step you would be taking an immense responsibility upon yourselves. I think that the! impression undoubtedly will be that yow feel yourselves in a position to close a door which, in the opinion of his Majesty&apos;s Government, may be found may, I only say &quot; may &quot; may be found to give the means of reaching a peace that, to my mind, would be a grave position, and I implore you not to take that step. I have gone back upon the past,, not at all for the purpose of recrimination, but I have discussed the attitude which your association have had towards a national agreement from the beginning because I wanted to convey to you the impression which that series of events has produced upon his Majesty&apos;s Government.If you will study what I have ventured to say when it appears in the transcript you will see that it casts a very significant light upon the position of his Majesty&apos;s Government. AVe were not aware that doors would be closed and would remain closed, even if the other side showed a disposition to knock at them or to enter in them. AVe were not aware that at this stage, after the country has suffered for so many weeics, the dispute would be prolonged, in the opinion of a great many people, through the closing of these doors, or any door, national or district. After all,, if it is your view that district settlements are much better than national settlements, and that district settlements would remove the necessity for national settlements, surely it is at least your duty to appear in the presence of the other party and to argue your case.But to take the course of saying, &quot; We are out of action altogether for the purposes of national negotiations as an associa-tion, and the matter no longer rests with us in any way,&quot; is to take a most serious attitude. After all, the question of a national agreement is an. industrial issue in the dispute as much as wages
and hours, and if the Government thought fit to set up an industrial court you would have to attend as a national body before that court or else see your case go by default. The matter is really not one when a body, which for a whole year has been before the public as the united spokesman of one side in the industry, should suddenly say, &quot;We have dissolved ourselves, our powers have gone, there is nothing but the void to talk to now.&quot;An attitude of that kind is bound to array against you a mass of public opinion in the country. So far as the Government is concerned, after what has passed and what has been said, and after the long recital of our honest understanding of the general position, it is quite clear that if we receive, as I earnestly hope we shall not receive certainly not to-day- but after you have consulted your constituents, if we receive in the course of the next day or two I agree with you that matters must be pressed forward a definite refusal to do business on any terms, or even to discuss whether business should be done if we did receive that, it is perfectly clear that we could not leave matters where they are. We have come into the open definitely in the last few days and have accepted a new situation, and the force and power of his Majesty&apos;s Government are engaged behind that position, and it is essential that that should be realised because we have great responsibility in this matter, we have legislated in this matter and legislated, as you have pointed out, in accordance with your advice and wishes, and therefore our responsibility is a very grave one.If a final decision on your part never to negotiate again with anybody on a national basis, never even to enter into a discussion with anyone on a national basis, was going to be the last word in the matter, if that should unhappily be your position and I most devoutly and earnestly hope it will not be your decision  if it should be, then it seems to me quite clear that we shall have to move forward upon our own course of action in your absence.But I would earnestly hope that you would seek from your constituents authority to enter into discussion in order that the position may be explored. It is not being explored in the districts to-day. Rightly or wrongly, however it may be, the Miners&apos; Federation have been able to impose a veto, except in the Midland Area, upon any effectual resumption and upon the making of district agreements. For you to take up at this time an unalterable attitude would be a very serious disaster. So may I take it, in conclusion, that while you adhere very strongly to the views which you have expressed, nevertheless you will seek from your constituents their opinion. You say the stoppage has continued because of the various peace movements otherwise, the men would have come in. I do not believe that for a moment, but whether that be true or false, in this country unquestionably .a prolonged dispute of this kind, causing all the suffering and the
distress which it deed, will he attended by repeated efforts for peace, and that is a fact you must take into consideration. Now, I do ask you to convene your constituents and to recover the power which you had. Use it as you think fit, and only if you see there is an improved situation. If there is not an improved situation, we shall not be in any attitude of antagonism to you. It is because wo believe that there is a change and because we hope that it may be developed into the means of peace and into removing the deadlock and into releasing the possibility of district settlements from the effective veto under which they now lie that we have taken this step.Mr. Evan Williams : I am sorry that in your concluding remarks you referred to the point which we discussed at such great length to begin with and that you again suggested we are seeking to take advantage, after it took place, of the fact that the Eight Hours Act is now on the Statute Book. I do most emphatically deny that that is the position in any shape or form. Our position has been perfectly clear, and I maintain there was a complete understanding between us and the Government and that the passing of the Eight Hours Act did not constitute a bargain of any sort between us and the Government. Unless the House of Commons thought it was a right thing to release the industry from the Seven Hours Act, it would not have done so. It was because it was the right thing to do. It was not contingent upon anything the owners did or were prepared to do.While the whole of the question in the districts is an industrial one the moment it is made national then it becomes political. We are firmly convinced that to start national negotiations, which we know cannot possibly come to any conclusion, would delay for an appreciable period settling down in the districts to considering their own problems and solving them. We are convinced that that would be the worst step we could possibly take at the present time. That is one of our reasons. The other main reason is that on its merits, in the interests of the country as a whole, you should put an end to the means of bringing about these national crises. Through this question of a national agreement, districts in which the owners have never given notice to the men were called out by the Miners&apos; Federation, a thing which could never happen except on a national basis.Mr. Bbidgeman : Nobody has suggested that you should begin with a national agreement before you have the district settlements.Mr. Evan Wtilliams : You have asked us to seek powers from our constituents, if I may so use the word. We cannot seek powers to do what we feel is wrong.   We have a meeting in the ordinary
way to-morrow of our central committee. We will certainly put the whole of the facts before them and we shall take their opinion.Mr. schatcht/bchill : I hope you will put before them the earnest considered request of the Government that they should empower you to come and meet the Miners&apos; Federation with a view to discussing what are the most expeditious means of ending the present deadlock. That is all I am asking at the moment. The miners will say, make a national agreement. It will be open to you to say-no, we think district agreements will be better, but at any rate come to the point where that issue can be raised.Sir L. Worthington-Evans : And to discuss what they mean by national agreement.   Let us see what the real difference is.Mr. Evan Williams : You know perfectly well the stand the Miners&apos; Federation has taken, there must be the national settle-ment and simultaneous resumption of work. That is the position they take up.If, as is practically certain when we discuss this matter to-morrow, our central committee, which consists of members of every district, and will have before them the whole of this discus-sion, which is going to be made public, are still of the same view, it will be dishonest on our part to enter into a semblance of discussion with the Miners&apos; Federation. We should have to tell them definitely that it is the view of our district associations that they will not permit the Mining Association to enter into national discussion, or national negotiations at all. You realise what the position is? A national settlement is impossible unless every district in the country comes into it. National negotiations by the Mining Association are impossible except with the consent of every district in the Association. If one large district, for instance, Yorkshire, were to say &quot; No, we are unalterably opposed to it, we will not authorise you to deal with this question nationally on our behalf,&quot; then the Mining Association could not deal with it.Mr. Chtjbchill : It is no use carrying the matter any further at the moment. The only thing to do is to wait until to-morrow, when you will let us know what your final position is. I cannot add anything to what I have said.[The proceedings then terminated.]10 Bowning-street, S.W.1,6th September, 1926.
