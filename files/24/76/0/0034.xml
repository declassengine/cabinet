      From Secretary of Stale to Viceroy, Foreign Department, 1st March 1919.    Foreign  Secret.  Your  telegram dated 25th  February.   Afghanistan.  I quiteappreciate  force of your plea for early action, but after consultation with  Grant Ithink immediate recognition would be premature.   Our policy in the  past  has been to recognise Amir who has succeeded in establishing himself.   Nasrullah has not yetdone  so, and  there are  indications that he may possibly not  do  so.  I greatly doubt whether we should take action which might turn the scale in his  favour while, unlessthe future  belies the past, it will certainly not make  him friendly to us.   I should therefore prefer, on Grant&apos;s  suggestion, to send amended  reply in terms  indicatedbelow, but  I  recognise  the  matter is one mainly for you, and if you have anythingfurther  to  say, I will  gladly  consider it.  If  you accept my  view, I will advise  theXing to send  a message  of condolence only.&apos;    Following are terms of  amended  reply proposed :     &quot; I  have received from  you with deepest regret  the  lamentable news of  theuntimely death of  your  brother His Majesty the late Amir Habibulla Khan  Siraj-ul-Millat-wa-ud-din.  United from of old by ties of friendship,  the British Governmentand  Government of Afghanistan are now united  by a  common  sorrow.   For whileAfghanistan  mourns the loss of a great  ruler, who ever sought the welfare of hiscountrymen and  by his wise statesmanship preserved it from the horrors which thewar, just ended, has brought to so many nations, the British Government mourns theloss  of a staunch friend, who throughout his reign maintained  firm the  alliance between  the two Governments.     &quot; You  tell me that you  have been unanimously acknowledged at Jalalabad  bymembers of  the  Royal  Family,  Kazis,  Ulema, officers and  representatives of civilpopulation, as their Amir, and have accepted their allegiance.   As  soon as the actionof the Princes and notables at Jalalabad  is confirmed by the  Princes. &amp;c, and  repre-sentatives  of  the Afghan people  as  a whole, and when with  their consent you have assumed the  reins of Government at Kabul,  I shall have  great pleasure in askingHis Majesty&apos;s Government to accord you the same recognition  as that accorded to yourlamented brother.     &quot; Meanwhile,  I note with  pleasure  that  you  have expressed  the  hope thatfriendship  and  friendly intercourse between the Government  of Afghanistan and theGovernment of Great  Britain will be daily strengthened and increased by your efforts and mine.  That friendship between the two Governments  is based  on treaties  andengagements concluded  with the British Government bv late Zia-ul-Millat-wa-ud-dinand confirmed by late Siraj-ul-Millat-Wa-ud-din, and I understand from what you saythat you intend, should  you  be recognised as Amir by  His Majesty&apos;s Government, toabide by them.   For my own part, you may rest assured that it  will be my constantendeavour  to foster the friendly relations between the two Governments.&quot;     Nasrulla should be addressed not as Amir or  His  Majesty, but merely as SardarNasrulla Khan, Naib-us-Sultauat, Arc.                From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 1st March 1919.                              (deceived at 10 pan.)    Clear the line.    Secret.   Afghanistan.  Three messages just received from British Agent who isnow at Jalalabad.    First, dated 24th February, reports  conclusion of mourning  ceremonies on 23rdand holding  of  Coronation  Durbar on  24th.   Inayatulla being  installed as Naib usSultana at the former.   All was quiet  except for secret  talk about  Inayatullafs)supersession, and anxiety over delay in receiving oath of submission from Kabul.Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.SECRET.
    Second, dated 25th (3.30 pan.):     &quot; (R.)  Farther revelations state anxiety increasing every moment regarding unusualsilence  from  Kabul.   Ain nd Daulah  demands  persistently  the  identity of themurderer  of his father(s)  as prime  thing here.   No one  placed,  under arrest.Cowardly  [two corrupt groups] because  it falls on strongest family  in  power, the family  of Musahiban Khas Rekab  Bashi Shah.   VVali Khan stands suspected asabettor, real murderer yet unknown.&quot;    Third, dated 26th February (1 p.m.):     &quot; (R.)   Subsequent reliable report [two corrupt groups], Ain ud Daulah  declaredhimself as Amir of Afghanistan at  Kabul, has formed  his own Government there,fortifying  Kabul, stopping all kinds of communications between Kabul and Jalalabad,demanding  firmly submission from his  uncle (? Oryever)  to come to Kabul.   AtJalalabad  lack of treasure and  stores is  a cause of a (? fixture) and anxiety.  AmirNasrulla Khan said, to be intending to ask aid of the  British Government  in treasureand arms if he failed to make his nephew agree.  Negotiations going on.   Situationgetting critical and dangerous favours done to Army.   Army at Kabul are  believed to persuade the force at Jalalabad  towards Ain ud Daulah as soon as (? news) are sufficiently  (? out).   We are warned by report to  take  precautions  from dangerthreatening and  expected soon.  Public and military (?  confusion) commenced to-day in spite of (? Ain) keeping peace [two corrupt groups].&quot;    Confirmation must be awaited.  British Agent is [corrupt group] alarmist  andhis sources of information indifferent.  As far as we know, Intimad ud Daula AbdulQuddus and Amin ud as a  Fateh Muhammad Khan are the only leading  personagesleft behind in Kabul.   Even  Ain ud DaukuYs mother, Ulya Hazrat, is in Jalalabad.Though question of recognition is  not one on which it would be wise to defer actionlong, we shall of course weigh it in. all its bearings in light of later intelligence.
