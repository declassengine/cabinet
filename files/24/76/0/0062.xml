Tho latter, in which thoiinancial interests aro 60 par cent Dutch and 40 per centBritish, consists of a very largo number of companies operatingall over tho world and engaged in the production, refining,transporting, and marketing of oil,  Llany of those companiosare on British register, but there has hitherto been nothing intheir constitution to prevent them being transferred to thoHague, where the ultimate control at present rostSr.  Tho agree-mont provides for permanent British control, I,a. the companiesshall remain British registered, a majority of the directorsshall bo British-born British subjects and no change in thodirectorate of tho Shell Company (the British holding company of the group), no sale of assets of any of the companies, andno change in their Articles ox&quot; Association shall be made withoutapproval of a nominee of His ilajestyrs Government.            These arrangements secure a very important measure ofpermanent British control over this very pov/orful group andalthough for the present no conspicuous change in personnelor policy can be looked for, or could perhaps bo insisted onwithout loss of efficiency, British influence in tho group is greatly strengthened and ultimate predominance is secured.  Ithas not been found practicable to effect any change at presentin the financial holdings of the operating companies of the group
which  remain as before,  60  per  cent Butch  and  40  per  cent  British,but  it  can  be  said  that  ths  possibility  of these  proportionsbeing modified to British advantage at some  future  time  has beene-ubstantially - increased.          At the present time the mobility of  the Fleet  is dependent on the good will  of the United States,  as only 2 percent of the world :s production  of petroleum  is  obtained  on Britishsoil, with perhaps another 2 per cent from territory  under British influence.  It is, therefore, a matter of  vital necessity  tosecure permanent control over other fields.  The  scheme  now putforward will achieve this and will ensure  that a  large proportionof the immense potential output of the Royal Butch-Shell Combinewill be handled by companies ?;hich are definitely and permanently-British,          I therefore confidently commend  the  agreement:which I have provisionally ratified.          The Foreign Office, India Office, Treasury, and board of Trade concur&apos;.          The Admiralty also agree, but wish to lay particularemphasis on the vital importance to Naval  interests that nodelay or difficulty should arise in regard to  the laying of apipe-line to bring oil from Persia to the Mediterranean.   This is                                                       l           :.&quot;V,-the only certain means now in sight of lessening  our  presentdangerous dependence on the United States  for  supplies of  fuel oil.W. H. L.
                     MEMORANDUM         It is desired to secure that the Shell Transport and trading Company, limited, and certain other companies includedin the Royal Dutch-Shell Group shall he brought permanentlyunder British control *  It is not, however, desired to interferewith the commercial policy or financial or business management of the companies- concerned.,          It is agreed that these objects can  be secured asfollows:-(a)  1.  His Majesty1^ Government will be advised,to use their     best endeavours to secure,  either by re-arrangement of the     capital in the Turkish Petroleum Company  or otherwise, that     the Royal Dutch-Shell Group by the medium of the Anglo-Saxon     Petroleum Company (or such other British  Company owned DJ     the Shell Group as may be deemed preferable by His Majesty^     Government) and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company shall be     admitted to equal participation in the exploitation of all     oilfields in Asia Minor including what is usually calledt     Mesopotamiao  The interest  of any other participant shall     be held as may be arranged  hereafter.

Notwithstanding the necessity for the Companyso forced to lay a pipe line from its fields to theMediterranean it will not oppose 02* obstruct directly or indirectly the laying at any date of a similar line connect-ing the Anglo-Persian fields with that shore, on the under-standing that the above is a Trans-continental line to con-vey oil to the Mediterranean, and not to be used directly or indirectly for distributing oil in Asia Minor.    5.
