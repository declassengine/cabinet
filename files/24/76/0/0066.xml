                                       UCONSCIENTIOUS  OBJECTORS.Memorandum by tho Homo Soorgtary.&apos;      246         Tho War Cabinet asked ne to consider whether any furthernitigation  of tho conditions of imprisonment could  bo given toOnsoiontious Objectors who havo served two yoara or more.         i have  gone into tho matter and I an satisfied that this  isnot practicable.   Conscientious Objectors who havo served one year,unless they aro guilty of porsistont nisconduct, already onjcy considerable privilege-;:  they aro allowod greater liberty of association than  otherprisoners and havo noro books, lottors and visits.         Towards tho end of last  year, Lord Cavo decided to try thoexperiment  of further  relaxations after two years.   Yfakoficld Prisonwas sot  aside a3 a prison for Consciontious Objectors, and it was proposedwhile keeping then within tho rather extensive area included in WakoficldPrison,  to  allow then practically the sane conditions of liberty, associationreoroation  and payment for wor,k as are enjoyed by Conscientious Objectorsworking  at  Dartnoor and other YJork Centres,    As coon, however,  as theConscientious Objectors arrived at Y/akcfiold they set all the rulesat defiance and refused to work, and tho  establishment . had to be broken up:  the Conscientious Objectors wore dispersed to  other prisons and revertedto the ordinary conditions of imprisonment.          It is quite certain that if further concessions are givon thesame result will follow.   The &quot;absolutist&quot; Consciontious Ob.1ootqr3 aroobstinately resolved to subnit to no f orn  of control, civil or militarv.          I may add that Conscientious Objectors arc not  generally  sufferingfron imprisonment:  a review by the medical officers of all those in prison on tho 5th February showed that of 1051 Conscientious Objootors, 357 had improved in hoalth since reception:  600 showed no  ohanger and  only 94 showed slight  deterioration.          The  privileges  granted to Conscientious Objectors are  strongly resented by other prisoners and led to an  outbreak  on the part  of some Australian soldiers  confined  in Vfandsworth;   and tho maintenance  of any sort of discipline among the Conscientious Objectors themselves  becomes noro and more difficult as  more  of  thorn roach tho  stage  of defying  all the forms ox  punishment permitted  by our very mild  prison code.11th liar oh, 1919.
