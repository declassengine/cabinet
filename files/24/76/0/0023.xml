          ASSIST Africa IP GiiilTERAL D^KIKIIT AT .NOVQKCSSISK  ,          With reference to the memorandum from the Ministry of                 /Shipping, G.T.675S, relative to this- matter, the Ministry -has since been informed by the War Office that, owing to a decision to increasethe supply of arms and equipment to cover an additional 150,000 menin South Russia, additional tonnage to the e2:tent of 150$ over thatpreviously indicated will be required.          In this connection, it is desired to know whether this tonnage should be supplied, involving as it will do on this basis the use of some 20 or more ships of 5,000 tons, which is a mostserious call on shipping.          At present we are experiencing great detentions everywhereand in consequence of sending so much extra cargo tonnage toAustralia there is a danger of running short of vessels to liftcoal cargoes, which might upset the miners.          rj?he Shipping Controller looks upon this demand as mostserious and suggests if any portion of work is to be done, Italyand Trance should be called 011 to give at least equal assistance,especially as most of it is from mediterranean ports,3rd karch, 1919.
