 This Document is the Property ofHis  Britannic  Majesty&apos;s GovernmentMINISTRY    OF    FOOD.eport for  Week  ending Wednesday,  February 26,  1919.                        PA LIT  L--ACTION &apos; TAKEN.     The ninth Labour Conference was held on February 22nd  at  the New CountyHall.  The Pood  Controller was  present  and  referred in  his address to the stepsalready taken by the Ministry to suspend Government control,and reduce prices.   Heemphasized that the agreed principle both of the Ministry of  Food and the TreasuryWas  to bring decontrol into effect,  whatever  the stocks held  by the Ministry and  thecost  at which they had been acquired, provided that by this means  prices would bereduced to and maintained at a lower level and that the risk of  profiteering waseliminated.  He also informed the delegates that  the operations  of  the Meat  Trustsboth here  and abroad were being  investigated and  that a memorandum on the subject had  been addressed to the Economic  Section of the League of Nations.     The Conference passed the following resolutions :        &quot; (1) That  this Conference,   composed  of  organised  workers,  co-operative             societies, and kindred  bodies in London, urges upon  the Government,             in  order  to  protect the workers  against exploitation  by  profiteers,             combines and food  trusts, to continue to maintain food control so that             maximum  prices may be fixed, short weight and adulteration stopped,             and the many devices of the profiteers circumvented.&quot;       &quot; (2) That  this Conference emphatically, protests against the policy  of  the             Ministry of Food in charging such a high price  for colonial meat and             regards such action as a most odious form of indirect taxation and             incidentally helping the American Meat Trust to monopolise the meat             market of the world.&quot;     On the suggestion of Sir Francis Boys it was arranged  that a further conference should be held shortly in order to discuss the whole question of meat prices in detail.     Stocks of Food--The following information showing  the total stocks of food inthe United Kingdom, the quantities  held  by, and in  transit to the Minstry of Food,and  the  quantities purchased for  shipment to  the  Uaited  Kingdom  but  as  yetunshipped, has been given in  reply to a question asked by Mr. Kennedy -Jones in theHouse of Commons.

     The total stocks of food given in the last column  of  the  table are  obtained from a return made by the actual  holders  of stocks in granaries and warehouses but do not include the goods in  the  possession of the smaller wholesalers or of retailers. Such total stocks in most cases, and especially in the case of  provisions, are consider- ably in excess  of the stocks owned  by the Ministry, as they include goods which have been handed over by the Ministry for the purpose of distribution  but still  remain in warehouse.  The  total  stocks of  the  main cereals include  the  stocks on farms as estimated by the Board of Agriculture,  The total  stocks, especially  in the case  of meat, bacon and cheese, include considerable quantities  which are at  the  disposal of the War Office and cannot be reckoned  on. as available for home consumption.     The stock of rice is large, a feature not uncommon during the war  period and due to  the import  into the United  Kingdom  of supplies which  previously went, to enemy countries.   The stock of cheese in terms of weekly consumption is  calculated on the assumption that&apos;only one-half of  the normal quantity is to be distributed ; but the availability of the cheese stock for general consumption is further diminished by the fact  that  considerable quantities are assigned to the Food  Commissioners for special distribution in particular districts.     The quantity in weeks&apos; consumption of Ministerial stocks requires this explanation. Stated without qualification,  it suggests that stocks are in some  cases rather short, e.g., in case of meat, that there is less than three weeks&apos; supplies.  In point  of  fact, the flocks and herds are not included in the Ministerial stocks, which at the present time are drawn  upon to  the  extent,  roughly,  of 10,000 tons a  week.   The same qualification applies to stocks of bacon and dairy produce.          INTER-DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON REDUCTION  OF  FOOD PRICES.     Meetings of the Committee were held on- February 21st and 26th.     Millers&apos; Offals. The Committee agreed that the price should be reduced by 10s. a ton immediately, an announcement being  made  that this price  would hold for  at least a month; and  that  the Flour Mills Control Committee should  have discretion, after the expiration  of a month, to reduce the  price by  a further 10s. a ton if the general demand throughout the country should be insufficient  to clear supplies at the first reduction.   The latter reduction would involve  financial assistance from the Treasury.   Any question  of export was  held   over  for  the  present  in order  that the amount of the home demand under the reduced prices might be ascertained.     Potatoes. It appeared that the only means of stimulating the home consumption of potatoes,  with  a view to disposing of the large surplus, would  be by a substantial reduction in. the retail prices, which would however involve a subsidy, of prohibitive amount  on  the part of the Treasury.  All possible steps are being taken  to obtain tonnage  for export  abroad, since it is probable that if it were available France and Belgium would purchase some  100,000 tons in addition  to the 200,000  tons  already being exported to France.     Sugar. In view of the  fact  that the present world  price  is  considerably above that at which sugar is sold by the Sugar Commission it  was agreed that a reduction in price  was impossible for the present.     Meat. A sub-committee of the main committee has the further reduction of meat prices  under consideration.     Food. Council. Meetings of the Council were held on February 20th and 25th.     Proposals for the suspension of the controlled prices of fish (with a few exceptions) were approved.     It was decided that the price of cheese should be reduced from h. Sd. to Is. 6d. per lb., and that the possibility of a further reduction should be investigated.     The  Council  Avas unable  to accept a proposal made by the Treasury  for the immediate export of coffee to Sweden in view of  the certainty that the price to the consumer in this country would thereby be increased.     It was decided that  a  letter should  be/ addressed to the Treasury asking for sanction  to expenditure up to 50O,000Z. for the .transport of  foodstuffs in view of the danger of strikes and in pursuance  of the  recent  Cabinet decision that stocks shouldbe moved inland.     Consumers&apos; Council. The Council met on February 26th.  The question of pure milk supply was discussed and the following resolutions were passed.     (1) &quot; That  this Council are of opinion that it would greatly assist the  quality of           milk supply if all  Inspecting  Authorities were  directed to certify milk
           which was produced under entirely satisfactory conditions, this milk to be           sold in special bottles with the local authority&apos;s stamp upon them certifying           that the milk complies with the standard of the Local Government Board           (or Ministry of Health), and to be sold as grade A milk.&quot;    (2) &quot;It is advisable that dealers in milk should be licensed,and that there should           be power to revoke the licence in the case of default.&quot;                            SUPPLIES AND LrsTitiBUTiON.    Meat. The  supplies of live stock  during&apos; the past  week have come  forwardrather more  freely  than had  been anticipated, with  the  result that  the  averageconsumption,  for the  whole  country has  consisted approximately  of 50 per  cent, ofhome-killed meat.  Figures furnished by the Live  Stock Commissioners, however,show  that for the past four weeks a considerable proportion of the authorised rationlias not been taken up.  It  remains to be seen what  effect  the reduction in  price,which automatically increases the authorised ration, will have upon consumption.    It has been decided  that the reduced prices for meat shall come into operation on Monday, March 3rd, instead of on March 1st, as originally announced.    The Central. Agricultural Advisory Council have recommended that the control ofthe sale of cattle and sheep  for slaughter should  be continued  until November  1st,1919, the maximum prices already fixed lor the month of September to be  maintaineduntil  that  date.  This recommendation  was  made in  order that  the termination ofcontrol might coincide approximately with the end of the grass season.    Bacon, Earns and Lard. The demand for  bacon, hams and  lard remains aboutnormal.  Orders have been sent for the purchase of 25,000 tons in the United  Statesand 10,000 tons in Canada to replace consignments being shipped to the Continent.The control of prices and distribution of  imported  bacon will be suspended  as from march 31st next.    Oils  and Fats. The  controlled distribution of margarine  will cease  as from march&apos;2nd,  Avhen margarine may  be purchased free of coupon, in any  quantitydesired,  and from any supplier.   A  Maximum Price Order  has been signed  and published, fixing the maximum price to the consumer at its present rate of Is. per lb,put the  effect  of  de-control has already been  that competing dealers  are  offeringsupplies at as much as &apos;ld. per lb, below this price.    The controlled  distribution of oil and fat compound  ceased on  February 16th  ;the price to manufacturers, bakers, and fish friers being fixed by Order at a maximum of Is. per lb.   Provision has also been made under  this Order for the supply ofcooking-fat to the public  at  a maximum price of Is. 3d. per lb., which there is good reason to believe will be reduced by competition.    The distribution of edible  oils for fish frying and other trade purposes will beplaced on a similar footing at an early date.    Arrangements have been made for the export to approved destinations of limited quantities of  margarine and oil and fat compound,  Export will be strictly controlledin order to secure the maintenance of such a supply for home consumption as will notreact  unfavourably on home prices.    Milk. A preliminary conference has been  held between  representatives of the boards of Agriculture, the  Local  Government Board,  and the Ministry  of  Food, todiscuss the question of permanent control  by the  State.  The conference is  meetingagain on March 5th.    In view of increased supplies of milk it has  been decided to revoke the Ice Cream(Restriction) Order, the Use of Milk (Licensing)  Order,  and the Milk (Restriction of establishments) Order within the next few weeks.    Tea. The suspension of the  Orders  governing  the distribution and price of teawill come into operation on March 24th.    Ballots of Government tea will be held on March 3rd and 17th, when the classifi-cation of  grades A,  B, and C will  be further  subdivided to  ensure a more equaldistribution of the various qualities.  Licensees under  the ballot will  be permitted todraw  up to 100 per cent,  of  their present indent quantity in each  ballot and  may sell.this tea at varying prices, provided that the tea is not sold by retail before March 24th.    China tea  purchased by the Government will  be balloted  on March  10th ata  flat rate of Is.  Id.  per lb.  As it will only  reach  retailers&apos;  shops shortly  before march 24th, it has been decided to allow this tea to  be sold on  and after that  datewithout the price being controlled.                                                                         JA 2
     Dried Fruits. -Large quantities of currants continue to arrive.  A further distri-bution of 3,000 tons of raisins has been arranged for this  week.     Cocoa. About 2,700 tons of  raw cocoa will  shortly be available for an interimallocation.   Shipments for February amount to 1.3,000 tons, and  after manufacturershave received their supplies for this month  some 40,000 tons of raw  cocoa will be inbonded warehouses.  The abolition of the distribution scheme is under consideration.     Coffee. The  licences to export  coffee  granted by  the War Trade  deparment during the last week amount to 500 tons ; a large proportion has gone to France.     The market remains firm and no  arrivals of any  quantity of coffee have  as  yetbeen reported.               ORDERS UNDER  DEFENCE OF  THE REALM REGULATIONS.     The Margarine (Maximum  Prices)  Order, 1919, dated 19th February 1919, carriesout the decision of the Ministry  to release all control  of distribution of margarine,except the registration of retail dealers.   It fixes maximum prices for manufacturers,importers,  wholesalers and  retailers as  from  March  2nd, the  retail price being  Is.per  lb.  The  Order revokes the  Margarine  (Registration of Dealers) Order,  1917,Part I., which refers to wholesale  dealers; the Margarine (Distribution) Order, 1918,1and  notices thereunder ; and the Margarine (Maximum Prices) Orders.     A notice  under the Shredded Suet  (Maximum Prices)  Order, 1918, reduces  theprice of shredded suet by 2d. per lb. all round.  The manufacturers&apos;, wholesalers&apos; and retailers&apos; prices come into force at varying dates so  as to allow reasonable time for  thedisposal of stocks.     A notice under the Vegetable Butter and Vegetable Lard (Maximum Prices)  Order,1918, revokes  the Order so far as it relates to lard,  and reduces  the maximum price ofvegetable butter by Id. per lb. all round.     An Order, dated 25th February, 1919, amending the Apples (Prices) Order, 1918,discontinues sale by weight (except by retailers), and resumes sale by package.  the retail price remains the same.     An  Order dated 25th  February,  1919,  revokes  the Horses (Rationing) Order,No. 2,  1918.   This abolishes restrictions as to feeding of  cereal  foodstuffs  to horses asfrom 1st March, the supplies of  oats  and maize  in  this country supplemented  byimportation being sufficient to allow of this.  -     A general licence, dated  25th February 1919, under  the Fish  (Prices)  No. 3Order,  1918, frees all  fish from control as  &quot;to price, except  brill, halibut, herrings,mackerel, salmon, soles, slips, trout and turbot.     A general licence, dated 25th February  1919, under the  Fish  (Registration ofDealers) Order, 1918, allows any  one  to sell  fish by retail  without  a  certificate of registration on and from March 3rd.                              ENFORCEMENT OF  ORDERS.     The total number of prosecutions during the week ending 15th February was 702,of which 585 resulted in convictions.  Prosecutions were reported under 64 differentOrders.     At West Bromwich a butcher, who had been  previously convicted under a FoodOrder, was sentenced to four months imprisonment with hard labour  on  two charges of slaughtering calves  on premises other than a  Government slaughter-house, andon one charge of keeping premises as a slaughter-house without a licence.     At Stepney a grocer was  fined 100L, and 51.  5s. costs, and sentenced to  twomonths hard labour for unlawfully delivering 16 cwts. of sugar without authority.
PART  [I.-SUMMARY OF  THE  FOOD  POSITION.                                      IMPORTS.
