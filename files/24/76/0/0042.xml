General Stratogio Sibuatlon*      Prom a military point of view this  io extremely favourable to - the Bolsheviks *  Like, the Central Powers during the recent war. their forces are operating on interior lines,,  that is to say., thoylean concentrate at will against each of  the widely separated Allied forces, &amp;s and when thoy wish, all troops  surplus to the minimum necessary for passive defence on the other frontse  Until such timo as the  various Allied forces are  capable of oomotbing more  than defence, this means that the vast majority of  tho Bolshevik forces are available for offensive action.   The  Allied force in  North&apos; Kussia  and in Siberia., on the other hand,  even assuming that the Allies  had a definito policy, ar* strung out on long fronts based cn inadequate communications, and consequently constitute no real threat  at present to the Bolsheviks *  Further, lateral communications parallel \vith the several fronts  are almost entirely lacking; whilo each of the fronts la entirely separate  from tho others as  regards land communicationso      It is due to the above facts that the Bolshevik forces have 1 been able in succession to gain successes  on the Orenburg front, at Archangel, in Esthonia,  Latvia and Lithuania, and they are now apparently concentrating on the Southern front with a view  to crushing Krasnov and Eenikin.      Tho Bolsheviks by the  capture of Orenburg recently established communication between Moscow and Turkestan, which will enable them to reinforce their force in the latter region and to carry out a cam- paign of propaganda in the  direction of  Afghanistan and the north-west frontier of India, in the event of the resistance of tho Turkomans and the  Trans-Cacpians collapsingo  These elements have  hitherto received afmeasure of British military support and  a  withdrawal of this support,                                                                   should this paper was drawn up before the 3cof  s&apos;c instructions were received.,and Is  subject to certain modifications  as tho result of the definite proposals since  put forward by tiie C.IrG.S., by whom It has not been finally approved.
should  suoh be decided on. may possibly react&apos; on the problemof tho  security of  India *   Both the Afghans and the north westfrontior tribes have been exceptionally quiet during tho last four months, but it must be anticipated that this state ofaffairs vail not continue if the Bolchoviks aro able to sendtheir Agents south of the former Russian frontier, or should theylead their revolutionary armies close to tint frontier. Hithertohowever Bolshevism has not appealed $0 these tribesmen, who are all small landowners a     Life the Germans, the Bolsheviks can raise the morale oftheir troops by pointing to easily won successes, whilst theAllies suffer from tho fatal military disadvantage of beingnowhere strong enough to strike a real blows  The Allies cannot *rely on a decisive military success unless they can ooncentrataconsiderably  superior forces on one or more fronts, whilstexerting sufficient pressure on the remainder to prevent unduewithdrawal of 0B9my troops to moot the main offensives0  Themilitary essentials then are     (a) A definite offensive polioyj and determination to         carry it through.     (b) Combined action on all fronts 0     (0) Suporior numbers, or falling superior numbers,         superior morale and equipment^2o   Economic Pond itions:-     The salient features of oconomic life In Soviet Russia areas follows :**     (a) The Co-operatives and Zemstvos have been practically         destroyed by the Bolsheviks.  This has been done with         the double object of destroying the machinery for the         election of a Constituenfc Assembly, and of obtaining        complete domination over tho peasantry and consequently         handling the rural produce.     (b) 513 industries have been nationalised, and 45$ of the         factorioo concerned in these Indus trios have sinco         closed downo  On 23.1.19* it was proposed to chut         down all factories in ordor to devote all available         coal To the railways *     The increased cost of         production Is illustrated by:-         Locomotive built Samara 1917 cost  56,000 Rs.             &quot;        &quot;     &quot;    1918  &quot;   6OO,-00Q Rs.
          (o) Mining industry is in a one.otic oondition resulting             from the allocation of the working to the looal             workpeople.  Production is negligible a             Jyo-naporti *&quot;AD-bO% of the looomotives are out of order*fj            The&apos; railway stations and ^urds ars congested with             superfluous employees, who in the case of the             South Western Railway alone are drawing pay at an             annual event of 46 million roubles .          t0) agriculture the production of grain otc* may be             conservatively estimated at 40$ of tho normalo             Thin ici due to tho peasants, lacking all articles             necessary for their work,, ploughs, agricultural             machinery, clothing, boots., *tCc They cannot purchase .             these necessities though they possess large Stocks             of tho worthless paper moncyo  They consequently hido             their grain and live on thoir reserves a0&apos;   ionelusions-   It Is evident from the foregoing that the economic1  conditions brought about by tho Bolshevik regime can have hut  one end - tht* bankruptcy of the Government and the country &amp;   On  tho other hand such are the resources and natural wealth of  the  country that thero ia still scope for the continuance of Bol-  shevik rulov Meanwhile much of Russia&apos;a potential wealth remains  undiminiohed in valuoj this, however^ does not apply to her  agriculture, and the difficulties of restoration are oonctantly  increasing.       Finally^ the Russian budget for 1919 speaks for itself:-&apos;   Revenue  (all sources) 15 milliard Ro o   Expenditure    &quot;     .46     n    &quot;  Tfcficit to be oovered by pap er 31 milliard Rao  $ BBC  Circulation before the war 4*5 milliards with S8$ gold cover.           11     October 1919     179     do.         2%      do.       The  conclusion is that whilst the present economic situation  ia bosoming daily more disadvantageous to the Bolsheviks, the  task awaiting any power which assumes responsibility for ths  reconstruction of Russia ia equally becoming more difficulto3 iAims of the Bolsheviks and of tho Allies o       The  aim of the Bolsheviks is the extermination of the  so called upper classes throughout the world, or failing that,  th&amp;Ir reduction to a stato of virtual servitudec     The  Bolsheviks have no national sentiment, and are merely using  Russia as a &quot;kicking off ground&quot;.    They are Indifferent to                                                              the.
Thethe suffering their methods  bring to the  people  of  Russia,but hope to retain the support of tho latter by  constant  con-quests.  Their aims appeal to a considerable class,  andthey have a perfectly clear policy which is to attack thebourgeois wherever and.whenever they meet him,  The situation *of the Allies is very different,  Bolshevism is  to a certain extent intangible and the Russians who oppose it are split up into many different sections with divergent policies.  TheAllies who have been supporting these Russians have also failedto accept a  common policy with regard to Russia,  If it is agreed that  the policy of the Bolsheviks is essentially badand that it  is  the duty  and the interest of the Allies tocrush  the Bolsheviks, it is essential that  the Allies  should put  aside all minor  interests  in working to  attain this end.Given&apos;,  however, a  firm decision and the &quot;will to win&quot;  theproppects  of military success  are  considerable,      A declaration in clear unmistakeable  terms to  the effectv that  the Allies,  including  America,  intend to support  the  anti-Bolsheviks  by all  possible  means,  short of the  despatch  of con- script troops,  would carry  enormous weight with all  classes inRussiac   If such  declaration were followed up by united  action founded on united policy,  and executed under united control, ulti-mate  success would be merely a natter of  time which it would be reasonable  to hope would not be  unduly  prolonged,4..   The  present  military situation.,      The  situation on the various  fronts  is outlined in  Appendix&quot;A11,   Generally speaking success  or failure are hanging in thebalance on  every  front and  a very  slight addition  of forces, moralor physical would  have an effect  out of all proportion to its size.   The  Bolsheviks who can  afford much  less  than their opponentsto remain on the defensive  are gaining a cheap  conquest  inthe Ukraine  where  the withdrawal of the Germans and  Austrianshas left them a free  field,,
 *    The Bolsheviks arc making groat  um of &quot;^ropq^ax^opponents have almost entirely nogloctod this work.    It is woll knowiu^^that the Russian) porhaps more than any  other typo,  is influoncod bytho last man who speaks to him, and the  Allies  should  assist  tho anti- &apos;Dolshoviks in making use nf propaganda as  a  means  of influencing themilitary situation in their favour3  Although  for the mc-Moiit thoBolsheviks are presenting a solid front  everywhere except  in Esthonia,in North Caucasus and in tho region of Perm, there is  reason  to hopethat should their opponents gain a docisive  success  at any point, thoBolshevik resistance may crumble up,  and such a result can greatly be assisted by propaganda, but oven more by economic  assistance.Cu^(a) ^c^aji^^affairs^^rman^o     The placing of Allied troops in  North Russia  was  forced  on us byreasons which no longer exist, ohicf  of  which was  that we  could notland thorn anywhoro else.   They remain partly  for  roasons  of  Nationalhonour, but mainly because they cannot bo  withdrawn, though from a mil&quot;itary point of viow their continued retention is a waste of effort. BasodOn exiguous and precarious lines of communication loading  back tounsatisfactory  coa communication, they  throaten areas of  no  particular importance to the enemy, cither from an economic,  political or milit-  -ary standpoint, and it must bo a keen source of satisfaction  to theBolsheviks that tho most formidable Allied effort is directed in suchan innocuous manner, while a similar force operating from  the Baltic &apos;or Black Sea would constitute a real  danger.       In  a scheme of combined operations our forces in North Russia could play  only a minorparto   At the same time, so long as  we  cannot  withdraw them  wo mustemploy them to retain as large a force of  Bolsheviks as possible.  after a year of Bolshevik rule tho area down to  the  Pctrograd^Viatka railway,at no time very product.ivor is probably  dostituto of supplies.     Thodifficulty of revictualLmg tho country, and opening up trade by meansof the two single railway lines, will throw  on us a burden altogetherincommensurate with the results tc be obtained.        Our policy,therefore, should be to adopt an aggressive  attitude by means of raids,and if we do not withdraw altogether  at  the  same time  endeavour to advance up the Dwina towards the railhead  at Kotlas, with  a
view to joining hands with Kolchak5s forsos advancing from thedirection of Viatka.  By restricting tho advance to tho riverline the numbers of civil population for whom food must &quot;besupplied would bo limited, though oven so the amount involved would be considerable, and it is doubtful whethert. tho sameeffort applied in South Eussia would not be more remunerative.(b ) Finlandt    General Judenich contemplates the organisation of a forceof some 30,000 Russians in Finnish territory, with a view to an advance on Petrogxado  General Mannerheim has stated that hewould be preparod to occupy the town with Finnish forces at his -disposal, but the wisdom of such a step is questionable, as itmight antagonise a large number of Russians otherwise well&apos;disposed-  It would appear to be most important that suchoccupation should be carried out mainly by Russian troops, andthat the Allies should issue a categorial denial to any idoathat Petrograd is to be soperated from Eussia  Further, itis absolutely essential that re-victualling the town should follow immediately after its occupation.  Strategically,control of the railway junctions immediately to the southof the town is of great importance, but it would be difficultto occupy them without relieving the immediate needs of thestarving population in the vicinity,   Givent however, a russian facade to the operations and prompt re-victualling andrestoration of trade, the occupation of jetrograd would have considerable moral effect, and would constitute a threat againstMoscow, tending to withdraw Bolshevik troops from decisivefrontSo(s) Baltic States,        :    The i-eague of Natiens is pledged to defend these small De-moerasies ag,.inst all comers,  but large portions have already beenoverrun by the enemy.  Allied assistance in arms, coupled withthe arrival of volunteers from Scandinavian countries, h-   alreadyeffectod a gr--at improv^m nt in th; situation In Ssthonio.                                                           Hithurto
* Draft of proposals since drawn up attached  as App. F.                       C7J  Hitherto  such assistance has heen rendered in piece-meal fashion,  and to effect good results responsibility for the provision  of  material,  and for the organization of Scandinavian and local  volunteer forces should definitely be allocated to one Power,  with  a view  to iproper co-ordination of effort,  In such   circumstances, and provided that the Bolshevik forces are active-   ly engaged on the other fronts, it is considered that such  assistance 3hould be sufficient to secure the integrity of these   small States, but it would be optimistic to assume that they  would have any value for  offensive operations.POLAND.        The Polish  troops  at  present under arms and available on   the  Eastern  front number  only 30,000, but after the arrival of   the  3 Polish divisions  (30,000 men) now being organised in Prance   and whose presence  is most urgently required In  Poland, a total   force of some  90,000  serviceable  troops,  could be  put into the  &apos;   field.  It would of  course be necessary for the Allies to supply   the  arms and the transport,  and  probably also the  clothing, for   these troops.    This Army should  be utilised for  an  advance into   Russia up to the line Vilna-Minsk, with their right  flank rost-\.                                                                  S   ing  on tho Pinsk marshes. Such an advance would  retain on the   Western front  at least  an equal number of the enemy  and as the   lines of advance on  Moscow are good would form a  decided threat   which could  be trams la ted&apos;into action if the opportunity offered. . The  cost of  maintaining  such a force in the field, if used for   operations outside the  boundaries of Poland, would rrobably   fall on  the  Allies.  The  problem  of transporting;  the  Polish  troops  from  France has not yet been solved anqthis is the first  essential,  Polish strength is also being dissipated by fighting   Ukranians and  Czechs and  the Allies would have to  ensure the  integrity of Poland on the German Galician and Czecho-Slovak  fronts,  by diplomatic or  other means.
GALICIA.      The attitude which will be-^Ukeu-up bynhe^&amp;ooh/v-^IUrvaksdepends very largely on the final decision  of  the  Paris  conference as to the territory now in dispute &quot;between  them and Poland,   Thalr-   ......forces are likely to he well organised and  well equipped but  it  isvery uncertain whether any of the 100,000 men  they can  put in thefield would be available for offensive operations,  It  is moreprobable that they would merely close the gap  between the Polish and roumanian frontiers against any incursions  of  the  Bolsheviks  intoCentral Europe,,R0UMi.NI A.     If Roumania remains an organised state in spite of the violentBolshevik propaganda now being carried out, her troops  could be utilised for an advance up to a line from the  North of  Odessa,             lAr.through  Jitanir,  to the Pinsk marshes.  There is no doubt that the roumanians would be willing  to do this if their claims  to Bessarabiaare  supported.  Owing  to the intense hostility which exists betweenRussians and Roumanians it is not considered advisable  that any largeoffensive should be undertaken by the latter,,   Here again the pres-ence of  such large forces  (250,000 according to General Berthelotlsestimate) is a potential menace  to Moscow and one  against which theBolsheviks  are bound  to maintain  a strong force.   The cost cf main-taining  the  Roumanian  forces would presumably fall on the Allies,and  the  maintenance of any Roumanian Army depends  oh early economic assistance by the Allies to  the country  as a whole,SOUTH  AND SOUTH-EAST  RUSSIA.     The main blow against  the  Bolshevik stronghold at Moscow will come from South  and South-east  Russia,   In  the South-east GeneralsDenikin  and Krasnoff  have  at present a force of some 130,000 menunder  arms  consisting principally of Don and Kuban Cossacks,  butconfidently  expect to raise  this  number  to between 200,000 and250,000.  This force  has been organised  by the energy and patriotismof these two Generals with the  assistance-of large numbers of the best of the officers  of the Old Russian Army  who withdrew to  this  area                                                         under
under Alexeieff and Kaledin after the destruction of the russian army by Bolshevik propaganda in 1917.  Up to the present this  force has received no material aid from the Allies and the moral assistance which wa3 given by the presence of British Missions has been largelydiscounted by the depressing effect of the Prinkipo proposals  andthe non-arrival of the Allied troops, which they appear to have assumed would follow the Missions,,  The general report given byBritish Military and Naval Officers, who have seen these troops,  isencouraging.  Discipline is good and the Russian officer appears  tobe really working with and for his men in a way utterly unknown  tothe old Russian army  Equipment i3 deficient in many respects,  asrifles and guns are of various patterns and are much worn.   This vhowever will shortly be remedied by the arrival of the equipment for the first 100,000 men provided by the British Government,  which includes, rifles, machine guns, guns and howitzers of all calibresup to 6&quot;and a few tanks, the bulk of which should be delivered toNovo Rossisk during March and will become available at the frontduring April and May.,  During the past month tho Don Cossacks havehowovey shown a lack of morale largely due to - (a) Bolshevik propaganda to the effect that the Allies were opposed to the Cossackmovement and -(b) to fear that as the result of the Germanevacuation of the Donetz Basin their left flank and communicationswere entirely exposedc This was indeed partially the case, butGeneral Denikin has now taken over a portion of this front with  *units of the Volunteer Army from the Southp  Another factor thatmakes for the weakening of the Don Army is the love of the Cossackfor his land which, while strengthening his arm so long as his country is protected, tends to make him desert if for military reasons his own district has to be evacuated.   The upshot ofthis has been some large desertions on the northern front, whichhave been wrongly claimed by the Bolshevik wireless as proof that the Don Cossacks are becoming Bolshevised.    As however                                                         the
The beginnings of this now Don Army were  brought  about by a revolt of these land-holding Cossacks  against Bol-shevik misrule wo can entirely discount these  claims.     The Volunteer Army has carried out very successful  &apos;operations in the South East and has recently  capturedthe important towns of llczdok and Vladikaykasj  the  latterof which has been the Bolshevik nerve centre In this area during the past few months *     In the Ukraine the situation is more involved.Skoropadski1s reactionary and pro-German  Government havingfallen, his embryo army, was dispersed and the  powerpassed for a time into the hands of the democratic partyled by Petliura, whose troops however consisted of ill-disciplined and badly equipped irregulars and  of  whomsome have passed over to Bolshevism.  The result has beenstrong Bolshevik inroads from the North,  which aregradually threatening to absorb into Soviet Russia thegreater part  of this very rich territory, and  we  shallhave to wait  some little time for the natural  reaction of the industrious southern Russian spirit against thepillaging and destructive treatment to which the  country will bo subjected,  There are, however, existing  in thoUkraine numbers of trained troops who could be  armed and put into the field by any strong Government whichat the same time promised to secure to the peasants theagrarian advantages brought about by the  revolution,and made commercial reorganisation a fundamental  partof its policy.  -A settlement must also be effectedbetween the Ukrainians and Poles.     No difficulty is anticipated in clearing  the rail-way from Vladikavkaz to Petrovsk, the latter now  heldby Indian troops.  The next step would be to selxe theBolshevik naval base 60 miles 11. of Petrovsk if possible before the ice melts at Astrakhan.,  This  should be                                       &apos;  -f.a/
followed by continued operations against Astrakan, which must be seized (or some point higher up the Volga) to prevent the enemy from transferring  superior naval forces into the Caspian. Those operations should result in a large increase of the forces of the Volunteer Army from the recruitment of the Cossacks of those countries who, though now dominated by the Bolsheviks, are like all other Cossacks, opposed to the Bolshevik spirit. At the same time, Denikin will extend his influence to all ports of South Russia and the Crimea and, working with the French forces round Odessa, will establish bases and an ever growing area of orderly territory. In order to co-ordinate all those operations the command of all Russian troops in South and South-East Russia must be vested in General Denikin who has with him many capable officers both for staff and for command. With this command would be associated General Brigg&apos;s Mission, and such representation as the French Government consider necessary. The French appear to be working to extend General Berthelot&apos;s command to the Ukraine and to exclude General Denikin&apos;s influence.

The second stage would be a gradual advance northwards from the Black Sea so as to recover the main contres of the Ukraine, coupled with a vigorous advance on the right flank on Moscow (1) along the line Taganrog - Kharkoff - Kursk. (2) on Voronezh and (3) up the Volga. This last advance would assist and be assisted by the operations of Kolchak&apos;s army from Ufa towards Samara and Ponsa. It is considered that those advances would at first be slow owing to the destruction of the lines of communication and to the resistance of the Bolshevik army, but would become more rapid when the rivers become available for movement (early April) and after a few successful  encounters.  It may be expected that the moral of the enemy troops will sink as pressure from

the
the-Soirth and east ,dcve&quot;lops., and as-mcnr^I,&apos;&apos;niat^lXlr-a^technical assistance of the Allied Powers makes itselfft; It at the front., whilst that of the ant j,--Bolshevik armies,will be raised in proportion.  The determining factors are  v .however,restoration and commiuiications and economic assistance.,rather than Bolshevik resistance *TRANS-0 also AS IA.,      British troops have been sent to Trans-Caucasia withthe object of opening good lines of commtuii cation to the caspian and to our forces in Trans -Caspia, ai d to secure thowlthdrawl of tho German ond Turkish troops on the Caucasus,&apos;and generally to ensure that tho terms of the Armistice with turkey arc carried out 6  With the withdrawal of Maileson lsforce,the first of these objects would largely disappear,but a certain amount still remains to be d-no as regards thesecond. In addition?the-; occupation of the country adjacent  *to tho Batum-Baku railway  aots us an insulator, preventingBolshevik currents from spreading into Azerbaijan and Kur-distan, and thence possibly into Persia,.   If it is decidedto continue operations against-Bolshevism,it would be wise  tomaintain tho effective occupation of tho railway,since on it depends the maintenance of Allied Naval  supremacy in the caspian,  Tho control  of tho  exits of the river Volga isof the highest importance,,since,pending the re-establish-mcnt of railway communications and the  supply  of rolling stock,this great  waterway will play an  important part inopening up nomo of the most  productive  areas in Russia for trade,  Further,it enables us to got  into  touch with theUral Cossacks,and thence eventually with  the left flank of Kolchak!s Siberian  army,SIBERIA  -    In  conjunction  with the main  offensive  from  &quot;the south we have that of Kolchak  from  Siberia,  Thefirst  operation would  be to  recapture Orenburg and  againclose  the railway Into Turkestan,   Left  to themselves                                                  the.
the Bolshevik forces and enemy prisoners might be dealt with effectively by Cossack forces in conjunction with Turkomans and Bokharans, and in any case would cease to have any influence on the main Issue, or to be any menace to the peace of India.

Orenburg being captured; a general advance might be initiated in the North from Perm towards Viatka, with the object of establishing communication through Kotlas with the Archangel forces (but see sub-para. A) and in the South from Krasnoi Ufimsk and Ufa towards Moscow. This advance would be based for supplies on Western Siberia where enormous stocks of food stuffs are in existence, but as most of the military material would have to come from Vladivostock by the Trans-Siberian railway a distance of 5,000 miles the momentum of the advance is not likely to be very great. It would be of great importance however to press on with all energy so as to obtain touch with Denikin&apos;s forces by the Volga and by the Samara-Pensa-Balaschov railway and to effect constant pressure towards Moscow.

Allied assistance should be confined to the protection and re-organisation of the lines of communication. The opening up of the Trans-Siberian railway, the vital factor in the whole situation on this front, has long been the subject of negotiations, but is apparently still delayed by diplomatic action on the part of the Japanese and the Americans. A few small parties of volunteer specialists should be employed at the front and in training schools and all possible assistance in material should a1so be given. If the Japanese however are prepared to put in fighting troops they should be encouraged to do so. The morale of the Siberian arms would be raised by the decision of the Allied Governments to combat Bolshevism and under those circumstances there is a reasonable hope that the Czecho-Slovaks Corps (42,000 strong) would again take its place at the front

where


 where its presence would be invaluable,, TRANS-CASPIA.      As stated above events in this Theatre, far distant from the main centres of Russian life, can have little or no effect on the main decision,. For the Allies tho length and difficulties of communications absorb too large a proportion of the available forces to render operations remunerative, Nothing short of a lengthy occupation would stabilize political conditions and as the military situation is dangerous it has been decided to with- &apos; draw to the Caspian.  Bolshevik methods are not likely to appeal to the Afghan any more than to the Turkoman or Bokharan except as a means of acquiring Russian territory and our withdrawal will probably result in nothing more serious than a recrudescence of local strife in which all parties will exhaust themselves,, SUMMARY,      The general plan of operations is thus:- (1) to base the decisive attack on the rich corn producing countries, (2) To advance through countries which, though at present stripped of supplies, are fertile and capable of being comparative- ly easily resurrected,. (3) To make all possible use of the fine waterways running into the Black Sea and Caspian, such as the Volga, Don and Dnieper, and the railways which from the South and East of Russia all lead to: Moscow At&apos; the same time to caver the states which rely on us for protect- ion, that is tho North Russian Government, Baltic Statos and Poland whilst avoiding the areas where food is exceptionally scarce.   (4)^opoiirin food and other necessaries of life and ro-establish- trade in rear of the Armies, otherwise wo shall arrive in the interior of Russia only to find that disorder has broken out in the countries passed over, and that the work of pacifying Russia has not been greatly advanced.  This has been the experience of every invader in the past.
6.   Division of responsibility betwoen tho Allies,     If the Allies are prepared to sink their minor interestsin the&apos;furtherance of the main object,  namely,  the defeat of theBolsheviks, the wasteful policy by which  each Allie is represented on oach and every front, should be abandoned and  definite rosponsib-ility should be allocatedr   If the Government  of the United Statescan be induced to participate in the now  policy together with thorost of tho Allies, the support of the  Eastern  front  should bo under-itaken jointly by the Americans and the  Japanese,  and  tho military intervention of both these Powers to the  fullest  possible extentshould be encourageda   It Is believed  that  given American consent,japan would be prepared to withdraw their former  opposition tosending troops through Wostern Siberia  to the Urals.   Similarly,responsibility for tho South Russian front might  be allocated to the british, while the French should be asked to assume responsibilityfor Poland, Roumania and the Ukraine,   To America should be allottedFinland, Latvia and Lithuania.   Assuming that  active operations areinitiated on all these fronts, the North Russian front would ceasoto have any real importance and should at any rate be liquidatedboforo the winter of 1920, if  not coonor.7*   Duration of tho Campaign,     Tho duration of the Campaign will depend as much or more  oneconomic and moral factors as  on purely military action.   In thocase of the Central Powers, where far  fuller information was available, it was  found  quite  impossible to gauge theco factors $  andspeculation in  the case  of RtGs ay basod on nothing in particular,appears to be  idle.    It is  essential, however, that military action should be  followed by  a  marked improvement In tho conditions of life  in that part of the country occupied by the Allies.    Thetemporary  elation caused by  our arrival would bo followed by anintense re-acticn if  no  such improvement took place,
                                                       IB.It is Jb r this reason that the main advances are plannedthrough country vh ion itself contains the necessities of ftlfc,the distribution of which is at present paralysed by the universal feeling of insecurity engendered by Bolshevikmethods. The first essential would bo-the ro-establishmentof communications, the restoration of trade fromthe cuifeideworld,and a plentiful supply of such commodities as clothesand household utensils.  In order that the inhabitantsshould be in a position to paytSsome system of finance mustbe re-established and mines and other commercial undertakings ^started to provide employment 0 From this it would appearto follow that the military advance must not be too rapid,otherwise troops will find themselves in ah exhausted countryamongst a starving population,and merely add to the universaldistress.  In such circumstances * no permanent good would result.8 ^KxoondiVire.      ITlie Bolsheviks finance their campaign by means of aprinting press.   Prior to that the Germans had floodedcountry with a vast quantity of bogus notes.     whether there is any object in putting good money into the countryinsuch conditions,or whetber we cannot also finance our friends in&apos;a similar kanner,is a matter on which the GeneralStaff are unable to offer an opinion,,  The essential appearsto be that there should be some medium of bargain as betweenthe goods whioh we put into the country and tho raw material which we take out in exchange e  If the printing press can provide such a currency without any ultimate gaurantoe, thefinancial outlay would be small, There remains the valueof war-like stores to be provided, Of arms and ammunition^country has a superfluity which has no saleable value,and whichwould have to be written off  in any case,  Some  attempt at  an estimate  for 6 months has been made in  Appendix     for tho British share of purely military cofaiit-ments.

On the other hand it is essential from the military point of view that during thoexecution of a military policy aimed at the suppression of theBolshevik regime, the Allies should take firm lines with theseveral Governments opposed io the Bolsheviks.  It is essential in  1order to hasten military success that the Allies should afford these governments the maximum of moral support, and that they should face the inevitable charge of interfering in tho domestic affairs ofRussiac  Action, or rather inaction, on the part of the Allies app-arontly based on fear of such criticism, has in the past so muchweakened tho hands of the Governments we have been attempting tosupport as to neutralise the actual military support afforded.10o  Ey^cu^determination      The alternative to the foregoing proposals is complete evae-uation. In this,however,we are handicapped by the fact that we cannotwithdraw from Archangel for some months to come for purely physicalreasons, whilst the Allied Governments have d-definitely promised to 1protect the States of Esthonia, Latvia, Poland and possibly Georgia.If wo withdraw from the remainder of Russia the Bolsheviks will beable to concentrate the v\hole of their available forces against theStates in question and the Allies may eventually havo to fight these forces without, tho assistance of the Russian Armies in Siberia and southern Russiae  This will probably entail the use of Allied troops -in considerable numbers.  without such troops the Bolsheviks couldonly be stepped by the Germans on the west and the Japanese on thooast, and at a subsequent date, when Bolshevism has spent itself,these two countries would be favourably placed to undertake theregeneration of Russiac  Consequently we must continue to help our friends, at any rate for a time, to enable us to extricate our troops from Archangelo  Vhsn this has been done, there remains our liability-ity to tho Baltic States for which America is equally responsible.
 Tho  following arc tho conclusions:- 1.   If the Allied aim is to crush the Bolsheviks and restore civilized Government in European Russia, the adoption of a common policy,  and of united action to give effect to that policy, is tho  first essential. 2.   The various anti-Bolshovik Governments should be afforded the  maximum amount of moral support, Ocg. by accrediting Allied Representatives, by declaration of sympathy etc. 3-,   Military action on each of tho several fronts should bo co-ordinated by allotting responsibilities to particular Powers including Americat 4,   Given a declaration as in 1, sufficient Russian man-pewor oxists to make  headway against tho Bolsheviks; until economic pressure exhaustcthe latter0   The Allies meet., however, oquip  and help  to organise thorn by moans of Allied Staffs and instructors as  was done in tho case of the Roumanian Army. 5o   Military action should bo supplemented by propaganda in Soviet Russia,   The only practicable form for such propaganda is direct propaganda by agontc working in tho towns and&quot;principal villagoSu G.   Military action must bo accompanied by economic action with a view to  the improvemont of the material condition of the  inhabitants of non-Bolshevik Russia and of rc-occuplod tcrritoryc   Such assistance cannot bo given until communicate ions are restored and therefore a rapid advance into the interior of Russia is out of tho question.   For this reason progress must be clow. 7,   Ho estimate can be given for the duration of hostilities as the dissolution of an army such as the &quot;Rod Army&quot; of the Bolsheviks, is&apos;dependent as much on moral as on material conoid- orations.   At  the camo time, if the Allied Governments are determined on the overthrow of the Bolsheviks, and are prepared to use to this  end all means short of the despatch of conscript troops, the General Staff consider the prospects of success
would justify the efforti8B   Whilst a rough estimate can Oe given (Appendix E)  for purely military expenditure, the General Staff have no  basis for computing the cost of accompanying economic relief, norwhether it is within tho power of the Allies,  without american assistance, to provide ito     As a first step to carrying out the policy indicated above tho setting up o  an Allied Council for  Russian affairs  *is recommended^,   Its scat night bo in V ashington,  Paris orLondon;   it should comprise political, military and economicsections and the former should include a publicity  burcaucIt would bo essential that the Council should  have  executive authority within the limits of the policy laid down for it from time to time by the Allied Governments0    The  establish-ment of such a Council would provide for united action  andwould be the surest guarantee of success *     Unless, the Allies are prepared to embark  on a  strongpolicy aimed at crushing the Bolsheviks and themselves  aidin the restoration of the country, the General Staff anticipate that Germany will inevitably, in the day of her recoveryherself undertake the task and recoup herself  in Russia forhor losses in this war.   Further, if tho Allies do not carryJapan withithem in a policy directed against the Bolsheviks,Japan will be compelled by her own interests to co-operate with Germany when the latter country adopts that policy.   AGerman-Japanese combination, absorbing a Russia destroyed bythe activities of the Bolsheviks and the Inaction of the Allies,would be a greater menace to the peace of tho  world than thatoffered by tho Central Powers in 1914.General Staff.

Our losses however have beenslight both in men and material, while heavy punishment has beeninflicted on the Bolshevik infantry who attacked with the greatestresolution.  A recent  successful raid near Kadish and a localoffensive on the SchredmocUeuga front have done  much to stabilise the position and raise the morale of the Allied troops.Meanwhile reinforcements of a battalion and a machine guncompany have been ordered  to Archangel from Murmansk and shouldbe available for action before the end of this month0  Murmanskhas also been instructed to hold a further battalion in readiness if requirede   The movement of these reinforcementsdepends very largely on the state of the Murmansk-Soroka railway and the security of the Soroka-Onega road,  No anxiety is felt as to any possible enemy action from the direction of Petrozav-odsk against Soroka, but the immediate despatch of technicaltroops for  the railway and of engineer troops, to relieveinfantry  now being utilised at Murmansk as working parties,  i3essential if we are to  avoid a serious breakdown in our communi-cations,     Were the offensive against Ax change1 to be pressedin the future with, the  vigour that has been shown during thopast month, farther reinforcements of reliable fighting troopsin this theatre mast be provided.  In this connection it is   tobe hoped that the American Government will see their way to despatch one first class battalion from France to stiffen up the ill-trained and somewhat unreliable regiment at present in thatarean  The British and French Governments must send the required -drafts to maintain their forces up to the established strengthand if possible to release such men as are due for immediate                                             demobilisationSECRET.0.2/5/14.

They would no doubt resistBolshevik aggression but without very decided morale and materialsupport from the Entente would not be of value for offensive operations directed against Petrojgrad.ESTONIA,     The Bolshevik invasion of Esthonia which was accompaniedby wholesale pillage and much ill-treatment of the inhabitants,has now been driven back by the efforts of the Esthonians  assisted by Finnish Volunteers and by arms supplied by the BritishGovernment.  The Esthonians have now almost completely clearedtheir own country, and if our assistance and that of the scandinavian Governments is continued, they should be able  tohold Bolshevism at bay.  The partial reopening of trade which isunder consideration will be the greatest assistance in competingagainst Bolshevik propaganda and in enabling the  military  forces to, be kept in the field.LATVIA k LITHUANIA,     These states have not as yet raised any considerablenumber of troops and the wave of Bolshevik invasion, havingreached the Baltic at Riga and Vindau, is now threatening  Libau.The policy adopted by the Bolsheviks in the Lithuanian area hasbeen so far conciliatory, with a view to creating a feeling intheir favour as  opposed to the Poles, and the discipline andbehaviour of their troops is reported as considerably betterthan that of the German troops whom they are replacing, It is                                                         of

The greatestefforts are being made in this area by propaganda and by armed force to upset the young Polish Government, and by spreadinganarchy throughout the country to enable its resources to boseized so as to meet the growing needs of disorganised andstarving russia  It is also hoped by the Bolsheviks  that from poland they will be able  eventually to attack Germany,ROUMANIA.

Owing to Bolshevik propaganda,  in which states thatvthe Allies are supporting the Bolsheviks against the DonCossacks, General Krasnov has been forced.to withdraw his troops a distance of some GO miles and is now behind theriver Don, holding a line running roughly west from Tsaritsin.An offensive directed against Rostoff has already capturedthe town of Lugansk, and to meet this threat Denikin has been 1forced to withdraw troops from his south-eastern front, thuslosing the fruits of his recent victory in that area.  He  hasalso been engaged in hostilities against the Georgians, whohave occupied the essentially Russian district of Sochi, butit has been intimated to him that these hostilities must ceaseimmediately, as  we cannot tolerate any effort to prejudge thedecision of the  Paris Conference as to the limits of Georgiaor any other independent state.     The supply  of military material including guns, and tanks, for 100,000 men is well forward.

The Russian Government continues to organise itsforces, which have now &quot;been purged of the Committee System,and are subjected to the  most rigorous treatment  In which large numbers of troops are shot for offences against disciplineThese troops are recruited largely from the peasants and workingclasses, whose sympathies are not Bolshevik, but  who are forcedto serve by hunger and by fear of reprisals against themselves and their families.  The moral of the troops of the Northern  and western Fronts is reported as good, but on the Eastern Front  ItIs poor, and instances have occurred of regiments refusing tofight and of wholesale desertion,  To deal with such mutiniesMaygar, Lettish and Chinese mercenaries are used.  Politicallythe position may appear to have improved slightly for theBolsheviks, as they have come to an agreement with the more moderate section of the Social Revolutionaries, but we can judgefrom the flood of propaganda denying the various  fully attestedfacts as to the state of Russia, such as destruction of industry the lack of food and the brutal atrocities against political opponents, that they feel their position is very insecure,.CONCLUSION.     There is no doubt that a definite allied attitude of opposition to the Bolsheviks and support of all the autonomousstates and Anti-Bolshevik Governments, both in material  and y-vfinance, will lead to a great strengthening of theopposition to Bolshevism throughout Russia, and if we accompanythis with immediate&apos; re-opening of trade and provision of the much needed commodities,  such as boots, clothing, agricultural implements, household utensils, etc, we shall bo creatingcontented and prosperous areas on the edges of Bolshevik Russia,                                                       thus

GENERAL STATE OF RUSSIA.      The Russian Government continues to organise itsforces, which have now been purged of the Committee System,and are subjected to the  most rigorous treatment in which large numbers of troops are shot for offences against discipline.These troops are recruited largely from the peasants and workingclasses, whose sympathies are not Bolshevik, but who are forcedto serve by hunger and by fear of reprisals against themselves and their families.  The  moral of the troops of the Northern and western Fronts is reported as good, but on the Eastern Front itis poor, and instances have occurred of regiments refusing tofight and of wholesale desertion.  To deal with such mutiniesMaygar, Lettish and Chinese merconaries are used.  Politicallythe position may appear to have improved slightly for theBolsheviks, as they have  come to an agreement with the more moderate section of the Social Revolutionaries, but we can judgefrom the flood of propaganda denying the various fully attestedfacts as to the state of Russia, such as destruction of industry,the lack of food and the  brutal atrocities against political opponents, that they feel their position is very insecure.CONCLUSION.     There is no doubt that a definite allied attitude of opposition to the Bolsheviks and support of all the autonomousstates and Anti-Bolshevik Governments, both in material aidfinance, will lead to a great strengthening of theopposition to Bolshevism  throughout Russia, and if we accompanythis with immediate&apos; re-opening of trade and provision of the much needed commodities,  such as boots, clothing, agricultural implements, household utensils,  etc., we shall be creatingcontented and prosperous  areas  on the edges of Bolshevik Russia,                                                       thus
thus providing the finest possible propaganda which willaot as a dissolvant of the bands with which tho Russianpeople have been bound in a fresh and mo.ro terribleservitude *

APPENDIX &quot;D&quot;.           The British  Government has, up to date, taken the following  steps  to  assist  the two fighting fronts in Siberia&apos;and South  Russia:-      (1)   To Siberia;  equipment for 100,000 men has already        been delivered, while that for a further 100,000 is in        preparation.           It is  calculated that all these equipments should        be available on this front by the early summer,,      (2)   To Denikin;  equipment for 100,000 men, including        guns of  all calibres, tanks and 100 aeroplanes Is await-        ing shipment or is under despatch, while that for a        further  150,000 is in preparation.           All  these should be available on the front by May,      (3)   Further provision of tanks and aeroplanes could be        made to  Denikin, but it is not&apos;considered that in view        of the length  of Kolchak&apos;s communications that any        further  large  quantity of store can with advantage        be sent  to  him a      (4)   The British  Government would not propose to send        troops to Denikin, but would organise small units of        Volunteers  to  train Russians to utilise the more        technical weapons, such as machine guns, tanks, armoured        cars,  aeroplanes and, if considered advisable, gas.General Staff,     War Office.       13,2,19,

PRESENT SITUATION.    (a)- Finland.^ is the least liable to attack, as the lines of    approach from Russia are cramped, and most of her Eastern frontier    is protected by our present occupation of the Murmansk area,    (b) Esthonia - has no natural frontier,  and having, with the    assistance of British warships, British arms and ammunition, and    some 2,000 Finnish Volunteers, recently cleared herself of the    Bolshevik forces, Is now again the object of a combined offensive    by Trotskyls Armies, whose avowed  Intention is to overturn the    present Government and to establish Soviet rule j this will form    the prelude to reabsorption into Russia,,                    &apos;                                                  j    fc) Latvia and Lithuania - have already been largely overrun by    the Bolsheviks,,  Both have, however, still the remains of. their    German garrison, who are making efforts  to stem the Bolshevik tide    undoubtedly with the intention of  persuading the country to unite    itself either entirely, or by close bonds of alliance, with the    German State.  The command at Libau  (Latvia) Is at present vested    In a German off leerc  The  southern part  of this country is largely    peopled by Poles and is liable to  form a bone of contention in  the1    future, of which source of trouble both  Germans and Bolsheviks  are    at present making the greatest use
                 ALLIED ACTION UP TO THE PRESPffT.(a) Finland,   Up to the present no military support whatever hasbeen given to the Finns by the british  the French, however, arenow despatching a small Military Mission.(b) Esthonia.,   Rifles, machine guns, ammunition and other military *stores, have been supplied by us to the  Esthonian Government,In addition^ during the Bolshevik invasion, the Navy assisted&apos; bybombarding the enemyrs troops and by capturing and handing tothe Esthonians 2 Bolshevik destroyers,        Steps are now being taken for the reopening of trade andInvestigations as to the possibility of re-establishing thefinancial situation are being made by the British Delegation inParis,Cc&apos;) LATVIAr   Some 5,GOC1 rifles, 50 Madsen guns and ammunitionwere landed at Libau, and with these, and the moral support givenby visits of the British Fleet, some progress has been made in organisation of local forces,(&apos;d) Lithuania,  So far It has not been possible to organise any assistance to this State, which has no- seaport..  It should however,be drawn Into the orbit of the Baltic States and supplied throughthe East Prussian harbour of Memel, in a similar way to that Inwhich the Poles are to be supplied through Danzig, or  else throughLibau,(e5 Nflval Action   The ships in the Baltic at present consist of                  2 Light Cruisers,                  5 Destroyers *                  2 Merchant Ships, engaged In carrying ammunition.

Tho Naval assistance required would be : -(a) - maintenance of soa communications botween this country and      tho Baltic States on behalf of tho Allies, and between the      Scandinavian countries and the Baltic States *(b) - interference with the cnomyfs sea communications and prevention1     : of enemy landings *(c) - bombardments of positions or villages occupied by the enemy.          The steps to bo taken to attain these 1 objects would haveto be considered at an early date by the Admiralty, as though theRussian Fleet is still fast in the ico near Kronstadt, it willbecome a potontial danger when tho ice molts in l,lay0                  STEPS TO BE TAICEil BY THE WAR office          As pointed out above, unity of command is essential, ifany good is to be achicvede   The stops to be taken if the care  ofthese states be allotted to Great Britain, are given in this and the succeeding paragraphc     UNITY OF COHMAND.          A General Officer shall bo appointed to  co-ordinate theBritish Missions to all theso states, and to command all volunteers *who may bo scnto     IN FINLAND,(a) - The immediate despatch of a British military riission for liaison with the Finnish Government, and with General Judonitch, also forinstructional purposes  and to counteract pro-G email propaganda;    the                                                            French
 french Mission referred to  In  paragraph 3.A* above to Dewa^tacho4^toj this;,   tho whole  to ho under the Genoral  Officer referred to in 6 above *                                                             2 (b)  - Supply of essentials  of military equipment for the Finnishjpfcrmy, and also for General  Judonitclrs force  cf Russian Volunteers. It is estimated that the Finns can  eventually place about 45,000 mon in the field, and General Judcnitch expects to raise 10,000 to 30,000      IN ESTHONIA. (a)  - It is suggested that  the British General Officer reforred to In para,6* should have his Headquarters  at Reval.  Ho should havo with him a small staff for liaison and for assistance in administration (a point on which all Russians inevitably  como to grief).  Attached. to this should bo an Instructional  Staff to train Esthonian troops In tho handling of the Howitzers, Guns and Machine Guns of British pattorns, which hafro been supplied, and an Administrative Branch to ensure that Allied Stores supplied  are put to the proper uso. (b) - Equipment, clothing,  transport,etc*, must be supplied for such troops as cannot be oqulpped from stocko at presont in Esthonia. Some 16,000 men aro at prosont under arms  (including 2,000 Finnish Volunteors), and it is estimated that a further 4,000 could bo raised in the country. (c) - Provision of clothing, arms and equipment to Volunteers from Scandinavian countries, who are at  present unable to proceed  to the Baltic States owing to lack of these essentials.   There are  at present about 1,000 Danes under formation  at  Copenhagen and numbers of Swedes are reported to bo willing to come  over to the Baltic State from Sweden.   If, however, tho Paris Conference make some definite decision of assistance to all anti-Bolshevik  states and forces, it is more than probable that a little pressure  on the Scandinavian countries would bring thorn to provide the  equipment and clothing required by these Volunteers, thus  economising transport from this country. O    LATVIA &amp; LITHUANIA t (a) - A small Military Mission should be sent to each of these countries, to work under the supervision of the General Officer, who
 ,v&apos;is to go to Estaoniar--rith-a,-follow to organising the forces which  are reported to be available.                                      w  (b) - Despatch of oqulpment and clothing for, in the first instance,  10,000  troops, such equipment only to be landed on the recommend at-  ion of  the Military Mission referred to in  (a)-above *  (c)   As above for Esthonia,0* British Volunteers .

of Vladivostock against the Bolshevik forces on the Ussuri front. Since then they have been distributed at various points along the Trans-Siberian Railway and at Omsk, and although small detachments have been to the front for the purpose of raising the moral of the Siberian troops, they have not been fighting. A naval armoured train with a ?" and 4-12 pdr. guns and some 28 ratings, has been employed both on the Ussuri and Ufa fronts. The Transcaspian forces, which have been relating up the Askhabad Government, have inflicted several severe defeats on the Bolshevik forces from Turkestan (consisting very largely of enemy prisoners) but are new being withdrawn. The forces in Transcaucasia were originally sent to enforce the armistice terms with Turkey, and are now keeping the peace along the Baku ?  Batum  Railway.

To South Russia two Missions under Lieutenant-Colonel Blackwood and Major General Poole respectively, have been despatched to investigate local conditions. The valuable reports received from them, have been the basis of the arrangements made for assisting the Volunteer Army.  A large Mission with a total strength of about 400 all ranks under Lieutenant-General Briggs is now in process of formation in order to maintain liaison and to assist in the training of troops and the distribution of the supplies which are being sent, vide paragraph 5.

B. WAR MATERIAL.

4. North Russia.

War material was sent in June, 1918, to North Russia to equip the 20,COO Czech troops who were expecting to arrive at Archangel. As these troops did not materialise, the equipment intended for them is being used for the Russian Army and the Russian levies in this region. At Murmansk equipment for 5,000 local troops has been provided and in addition a certain amount has been done for the Serbian forces. In addition the greatest care was taken for the organisation of winter mobile troops, both Allied and local, and a large quantity of special equipment was purchased in America or manufactured in this country.  All the above was supplied by the British Government.  Further details are shown on Appendix "I".

The French Government have supplied a certain number of 65 mm. and 37 mm guns and ammunition; also ammunition for the 155 mm. and 75 mm. a guns which formed part of the stores saved at Archangel when the Allied forces landed.

5. Siberia.

Sanction was given under War Cabinet Decision dated 25th September and 6th December, 1918, for provision of equipment etc. for a total of 200,000 me. In addition the valuable stocks of war material lying at Vladivostock? most of which had been purchased on British credits, were placed at the disposal of the Siberian Government and railway material, such as lecomotives and wagons purchased on British credits in the United States, have been despatched to Vladivestock to assist in the reorganisation of the Trans-Siberian Railway.  The principal details of the material supplied by the British Government are shown in Appendix "II".

          The French are supplying up to 424 of their field gunswhich have been altered so as to take Russian ammunition.          The amorj can Government has despatched a certain quantityof stores including clothing and machine guns,  for use of the czecho-Slovak troops.  They have however consistently refused toassist in any way in the equipping of the Russian forces.   Detailsof such assistance as they have given are shown on Appendix &quot;ill&apos;1,6 *  South Rj.ssia9.

The American Government, who had agreed in principle tofurnishing tho food, failed to provide it in time, and to avoiddisaster the above stops were taken.  Similarly to Murmanskfood for 100,000 civilians has been and still is being provided,and up to the present the bulk of this has also come from Britishstocks, principally from that of the Armvc  The Americans have however recently sent a few thousand tons.
