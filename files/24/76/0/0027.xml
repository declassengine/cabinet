ELECTRICITY (SuTPLY) BILL,I Note by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate to the War Cabinet the  attached memorandum which has &quot;been prepared in the Boardof Trade, together with a copy of the  draft bill referred to0Board of  (Trade,     3rd Maroh,  1919*
MBMORAKDM.     A draft of&apos; the laectricity Uujjply) bill is being circulated to the Cabinet with a view to its immediate introduction in the House of Commons.     The Bill is based in tho main on the Report of theBoard of Trade Committee on Eleotric Power Supply (Cd.9062).     The Bill is not in its final form, and a number of amendments are being prepared, but the draft will enable theCabinet to form an opinion on the main lines of the proposal.The chief alterations which it ia proposed to make are to addprovisions for the compulsory acquisition of main transmissionlines and of&quot;public utility&quot;&apos; generating stations; the enforcement of the due performance,of their duties by theDistrict Electricity Boards;  and to omit the provisions forthe issue of stock by District Electricity Boards andsubscriptions by consumers.     It has been felt for some time that the existing legis-lation with regard to the supply of electricity, involving the multiplication of small generating stations and smallgenerating plants, the wasteful use of coal and unduly high cost of production of electricity has impeded progress.Developments during the last few years in the design of largesteam turbines and electrical generating plant and in the.useof high-pressure lines and cables oh the one hand, and the  .&quot;growth of electro-chemical and metallurgical industries,electrification of railways and other industrial applicationson the other hand, have fundamentally altered the situation.     The present Bill proposes to set up wide districts inwhich the generation of electricity can be concentrated, and the stations situated on the most favourable sites whence electricitywill be transmitted to existing distributors or to individual industries.     The general supervision and control of the electric supply industry will be vested in a small body of BleotrioityCommissioners who, after examination and inquiry, willestablish district electricity boards by Speoial Orders, themembers of the boards being elected from the looal authorities,companies and persons being authorised undertakers within the districts, and from large consumers, and labour.     The powers and duties under the existing Lieotrio lightingActs will be exercised through the Commissioners.     The main duty of the boards will be to secure a cheap andabundant supply of electricity within their districts, and provision&apos; will be inserted for enforcing the due perfo.tr..neeof their duties.
     All generating stations, (other than private gencrat-&apos;  &apos;ing otations)?and all necessary portions of the main trans-mission systems  will - unless there are special reasons tothe contrary in a particular case - b.e vested in the dis-trict boards,     The price to be paid is;-              ;, .;            (a)  in the case of local authorities;  the                       outstanding loan obligations.            (b)  in  the  case of companies, the actual cost                       less depreciation aB determined by  1                       the ISlectrioity Commissioners.     The district boards are empowered to distributeelectricity within their  districts in any area where there -ia either no supply or where the supply is insufficient.The  Commissioners can impose on the boards the obligationto supply within such areas, on such terms as may be specified.     The proposal is that present authorised undertakersshall retain their distribution systems, being supplied in bulk by the district boards.  The boards may, however, pur-chase the distribution undertakings by agreement.     Provision is made in the Bill for the Commissioners torequire any distributor to give facilities, including theprovision of new works for the iiupply of electricity.     In special cases a district board may be authorised by special Order to lease their undertaking to an operatingauthority or company.  The amendment to be inserted in theBill will require this authorisation to be by Special Order.     There are transitory provisions in the Bill to cover the time, between the setting up of the Commissioners and theestablishment of the district boards, whereby one or moreundertakers may be required to assist each other and thus prevent the extension of tm unnecessary number of power stations     An addition  is to be made to the Bill whereby the Com-missioners or the Board.of Trade themselves nay establish - -new&apos;generating stations in  certain cases pending the estab-lishment of the district board.     The district boards will be financed either               (a)   by the Treasury or      -  -               (b)   in special cases by local authorities
      The powers of other Departments to sanction loans under the Electric Lighting Acts will he Tested in the Poard of Trade.      The charges to &quot;be made by district &quot;boards for electricity are to he so fised as only to cover their working expenses^with a reasonable margin approved &quot;by the Commissioners,  and the 3oard of Trade on the representation of the Commissioners may revise the existing provisions relating to maximum prioes with a view of securing to oonsumers the &quot;benefit of any reduction in then cost of generation.      There are also a number of miscellaneous minor provisions with which the Csbinat need not be troubled,  but there are two,special points to whioh attention should bo drawn.      The draft Bill contains a clause [clause 32)  applying to generating stations the provisions of section 4 of the Conspiracytand Protection of Property Act, 1875.   This section provides that any employee of a gas or water undertaking who breaks his&quot;contract of service with the probable consequence  of depriving the publio of a supply of gas or water is guilty of a  penal offence,lt will be remembered that a Defence of the Realm regulation. was recently maae in similar terms when the Electrical Trades Union threatened a gensral strike.   That regulation was,  however, necessarily wider in scope than the 1875 provision as  the Defence &apos; of the Eealm Regulations make incitement to a breach of  a regulation equally a penal offence.   While it is  no doubt the case that the larger generating stations of the fat-fire will furnish an extreme example of the power of a strike, without notice,  to interfere with the life of the community, great doubt is felt as to the advisability of dealing specially with the case of a strike at. a generating station in this Bill,  and  it is thought that the question is rather one that should be left to be dealt with as part of a general policy.!    , The second p%int relates to the application of the   Bill to Ireland.   Ireland has been eroluded from the Bill at  the request of the Irish Local government Board,  who point out that  the whole tendency of legislation of recent years is towards ths administration   of all Irish affairs in Ireland,  and separately as far as possible from central control in London.   So far  as electricity  is concerned the question is not likely to be one of  great  practical importance for some years *   If Ireland is excluded from the Bill the administration of the existing lav; with regard to  electricity supply will remain with the Board of Trade unless  transferred by  a provision in the New Home Rule Act or by an Order  in Council under the Home Kule Act,  1914.      Axuling of the Cabinet is desired on these two points.Board of Trade,   3rd March, 1919.
