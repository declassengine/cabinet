     1. The Chairman said he thought it would not be necessary tocall another Meeting of the Conference, and that it only remained,subject to one or two points he proposed to raise, for  the . result oftheir deliberations to take the form of definite instructions and action.Excess Profits Duty.      2.  The Chairman said that various suggestions had. been made                  that trade was being hampered by Excess Profit Duty and by reason                  of no announcement being made by the Government on the subject.                  The matter had been, however, carefully considered by a Meeting of                  Ministers  on the previous day,  when  it  was decided  that  no                  announcement should be made  on  the subject  before the  Budget                  statement, and that, in fact, any announcement before then on  the                  matter  would have an adverse  effect on trade.Paper Control.          3.  With reference to Minute 4 of the 4th Meeting, The Chairman                  said that the Treasury had no objection to the Paper Control being                  abolished forthwith.                                                                     *                      Sir Albert Stanley said that he had just come from interviewing                  a deputation of News-Print Users,  who, after consultation with the                  manufacturers, suggested that, rather than do away  with  control                  completely, it would be better in the interests, both of  themselves                  an:d the manufacturers,  for the imports  to be  increased up  to  75                  per cent, of the pre-war imports  until the end of April, when all  .         . .     control  should be completely abolished.   This arrangement  would                  suit them  much better  than  abolishing  control immediately.  Sir                  Albert thought that it might be  well to adopt this suggestion, as                  otherwise irritation might  be caused.                      The Chairman stated that  he did not see it would make any                  practical difference as it  was very unlikely that imports  would have                  risen to  75 per cent, of pre-war imports within two months.                      It was decided that  :-  .-. .        ,      .  . The restrictions  on the imports of paper and paper pulp be                          relaxed to the extent of allowing imports up to  75 per cent.                          of pre-war imports, and that this arrangement should have                          effect until the end of April next, when all paper control                          should be abolished.Cotton Industry.         4. The Chairman said that numerous suggestions had been made                  as  to  the  desirability of subsidising the cotton industry,  and the                  question  arose  as to  whether  it  was  desirable  or  not  for  the                  Government  to  interfere financially  with industry.   He  was not                  referring to subsidy in the sense of  giving financial assistance to                  public works which  wrere being carried out in  execution of a policy.                  He said there were three suggestions which had been made as to how                  cotton industry should be subsidised :                                i/                      (i.) That the Government should place large orders and either                             take the profit or suffer the loss.                      (ii.) That the Government should underwrite or guarantee the                             middle-men in the trade.                      (iii.) That  the  Government provide a margin up to a certain                             percentage of the extra cost  due to war conditions.                      The Chairman  said he would be glad to hear the views  of the                  Conference on this point.                      Sir Percy Bates remarked that from the information he possessed,                  he felt sure that one of the greatest hindrances to the revival of the                  cotton industry was the cable congestion which existed, and prevented
a large amount of business being  done.   He thought it was a realhindrance.     Mr. Illingworth pointed out  that the cables were not a PostOffice  matter,  but that he thought the  Government  departments were very  much responsible for this,  as  they had a priority, andexercised it to a large extent on  matter  which was not always  of supreme importance.  He  thought that if the  use of private  codeswas permitted congestion would be greatly relieved.     Sir Auckland Geddes  said that it certainly appeared that the cable situation  had a strong bearing on the subject, but  the state  ofthe cotton  market was a greater difficulty.     Colonel Amery thought, while not favouring the last two of thethree methods  of subsidising  suggested, that something  might bedone on the  lines of the third, which was, in fact, simply a form ofbounty on  export.  The advantage of a bounty was that it was onlypaid if results were actually  achieved,   and  it  acted  as  a directstimulas to individual initiative.   He reminded the Conference thatthe Lancashire  cotton trade was the creation of the export bountywhich had  been enforced from 1783 onwards..     Mr. Illingworth said the question of  subsidising was considered at the  beginning of the war.  It was then considered very risky,  asit was  impossible to  foresee whether the benefits expected would emerge.  He thought the  policy was a dangerous one, and would create   apathy  in the trade.   He mentioned  that  a  very similarsituation arose  in the cotton industry after the beginning of the war,but that it righted itself in due course.     Lord  Emmott was opposed to the principle of subsidising, but was not altogether opposed to the suggestion made by Colonel Amery.He felt, however, from his knowledge of the trade that it would be a dangerous thing to carry subsidising into effect, and he thought thatthe wisest  course was to give the trade an opportunity  of adjustingitself.   Nobody knew yet what costs were going to be, and tnat was what the  trade was waiting for.   He thought  it very  desirable to investigate the question  of relative costs  in this country and  othercountries, and he referred to a case where  another country had beenable to  produce  at a  much cheaper cost   than  could be done  here.He presumed that the Chairman  was considering the question only from the point of view  of unemployment, as employers themselveshad had so good a year in  1918 that they could afford to wait for atime.     The Chairman said that the point as  to whether it  was wise  to subsidise or  not was one of the basic matters to be considered  inconnection  with unemployment.  He reminded  the Conference that unemployment  in the cotton  industry was  very high,  and that  itwas desirable to bear in mind that the amount which might be paidin unemployment donations might well  cover any subsidy whichmight be granted, either in the shape of bounty as suggested by colonel Amery, or otherwise.  He merely  mentioned  this, not asexpressing  his  own views, hut in order that the  possibility mightnot be  lost  sight of.     Mr. Chapman said he was opposed to any principle of subsidisingthe cotton,  industry, as he thought it would  have dangerous results.He was inclined to  think that too much  anxiety was being felt  inregard  to  this  industry.  It  was necessary to bear in mind the peculiar psychology of the people engaged- in the cotton industry,-and  to  remember that  they were waiting  for the market to get to the  bottom.  He  said  the  China market was  recovering, andhe expected that the Indian market would recover by the latest inthe  early summer, and the expectation in cotton circles was that     [1205]-289                                       B 2
freights would  go down  very soon.  He strongly  urged taking no action in the matter.    Sir Percy  Bates  said he was  in complete agreement with Mr.Chapman, and he suggested  that not only should nothing be done,but that the trade should be informed that nothing was going to bedone by the Government.    It was decided that:     (a.)  It was unnecessary and undesirable for the Government to           take any  steps,  by way of subsidies or otherwise, for           stimulating the cotton industry.    (b.)  This was to  be regarded as typifying a general principle,           which should not be departed from without  specific War           Cabinet authorisation on individual application.Eestrictions on          5.  With reference to Minute 4 of the 1st Meeting, the ChairmanImports.           saicj ^at the Report of  the Sub-Committee, appointed under  the                  chairmanship of Lord Emmott, had now been received and circulated,                  and he  would be glad to hear Mr. Harmsworth&apos;s views  on it.                      Mr. Harmsworth said he had not had an opportunity of studying                  the report, and feared he  would have to take time to consider it.                      Lord  Emmott pointed out  that it was very urgent that this                  matter  should be pushed through without delay,  and he thought                  that it  was for the Government to decide to adopt these alterations,                  and thus to give the Allies a lead.                      He gave a short explanation of the  methods with which  the                  Sub-Committee had worked  in getting out the revised Lists &quot; A,&quot;                  &quot; B,&quot; and &quot; C,&quot; and reiterated his conviction that, if the export trade                  were to  be  revived, nothing should stand  in  the way of these                  alterations coming into force.                      Mr. Harmsworth  said he thought  it  would  be  necessary for                  him to   consult the Allied Blockade Committee and  the  Superior                  Council of the Blockade in  Paris.   In  the meantime  he would                  discuss  the matter with  his own experts.   The United States were                  anxious to break  up the  blockade, and  if independent  action were                  taken by this country, it would very much  strengthen their hands,                  he therefore urged caution.  The naval and military authorities were                  firmly of opinion that the blockade should not be relaxed, as it was                  the strongest weapon the Allies had in their possession for imposing                  terms upon Germany, and he felt that List &quot; C,&quot; as submitted by                  the  Sub-Committee, made a  very  considerable7 inroad  into  the                  blockade machine.  The  blockade  would  cease when  peace was                  signed in fact he understood that legally it automatically ceased                  then and as that might only be a matter of a couple of months, he                  urged that List &quot;  0,&quot; as amended, should not be carried into effect                  until that time, so that the machinery of the blockade might remain                  untouched.                      Lord  Emmott remarked that if the blockade was only going to                  last a  couple of months longer, Mr. Harmsworth need  have no                  hesitation  about agreeing to the revised list coming into operation,                  as the  quantity of goods that  would percolate in that time into                  German)^ would be negligible.                      The Chairman suggested that it might be possible to have a                  short list of articles which were not to go through the blockade, and                  another list of articles which could.                      Lord  Emmott felt that it  might be  good  policy  to  let  the                  Germans have some goods going to  their country, so that if it were                  necessary  to  reimpose  restrictions  for bargaining  purposes, they                  would feel the change back to complete embargo all  the more.
     Mr. Harmsworth  said  he was  mainly concerned with articles which might by some  means  or other be used as or  for munitions,but  he would consider the  report of the sub-committee  with his department, and be prepared to discuss the matter by the following monday at the latest.     6.  The Chairman read to the Conference a letter which  he hadreceived from  Sir A.  Steel-Maitland, with regard to the export ofmaterials to Roumania.  Sir Arthur said that there was great wantin that country of articles which we could supply, such as agricultural machinery,  textiles, &amp;c, if the  necessary  arrangements  could  bemade as regards credits and the question of exchange.  Sir Arthurmentioned  that he understood that the Americans,  Canadians,  andFrench  were already  managing  to  get their goods imported intoRoumania.     Mr. Harmsworth  said that since the removal of restrictions onthe  export of materials to South-eastern Europe, there need be nodifficulty so  far  as  the blockade was concerned.  He  felt that wecould with  safety grant freedom of trade to all the enemy countriesexcept  Germany, and  he did not think that there was  any great danger  of  goods  sent into  what  was  formerly  Austria-Hungaryfiltering into Germany.  In reply to a question whether the fact  was generally known that  restrictions  had  been withdrawn  so far asSouth-eastern Europe  was concerned, he said he was  by no meanssatisfied with the present arrangements for publicity.     Lord Emmott said that  his  Department was  in  the habit of communicating   to  the newspapers  practically  every  day  such information  as  was of importance.     Mr. Earmsworth expressed the fear that the newspapers couldnot be  relied upon  to  do what was wanted  in every case, especially if articles sent to them for publication were very long or dull.     The Chairman thought it essential that really adequate publicity should be given.     Mr. Betterton suggested that if the newspapers did not publish the  information  desired,  it might be given  in the form of  paidadvertisements,   especially in the  ca^e  of  newspapers  dealingparticularly  with technical matters.     Lord Emmott,  however,  pointed out that this  practice wouldrequire  Treasury sanction before it could be adopted.     The Chairman expressed  the view that something  might bedone by arranging interviews with press representatives.     After further discussion, it was decided  that:      The President of the Board of Trade should be responsible for         arranging  that adequate publicity be given in connection         with decisions regarding British Trade.     7. Sir Albert  Stanley said that he had  heard unofficially thatthe War Office had decided to fix the price of wool for eight months,but he was  not able to give definite particulars, as his department had  not  been  consulted.   The decisions might  be quite correct, buthe  thought it was a matter for  consultation with the Board ofTrade.  Sir Albert also referred to  the anxiety at present felt inBradford because France had reduced her imports of wool.
     Mr. Illingworth pointed out  that the demands  for  Bradfordgoods greatly exceeded its supply, and that the imposition of restric-tions on imports by France was due to financial considerations.     It was decided that      The Board of Trade should enquire  further  into  the position         with a view to obtaining precise information.     8. The Chairman decided that the point raised by Sir A. Stanleyin connection with wool showed that  there was insufficient co-ordina-tion between Departments with regard to the interchange of informa-tion.   It is essential that  the President  of the Board  of trade should  be  consulted about  all  action  relating  to  stocks  of rawmaterials  held  by Departments  of State.  No action regardingthese materials  should  be taken by any Department  without thePresident of  the Board  of Trade&apos;s concurrence, except on the directinstruction of the War Cabinet.(Initialled)       A.
