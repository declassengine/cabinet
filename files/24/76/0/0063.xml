Jfl!8 Oocuwent i336THE  POTATO  POSITIONORANDUM BY THE POOD CONTROLLER. 1.        I desire  to  lay before the  Cabinet thb following information     as  to the action  being taken by  the Ministry of Pood in regard     to  tho purchase and disposal of  the 1918 Potato crop. 2 *       At  the beginning of 1918 an announcement was made that the     pood Controller would purchase the entire crop with certain minor     exceptions. 3.       In  July 1918 a Potatoes (Growers1 Prices) Commission was     appointed in order to fix the prices of the crop.  This Commission     took the necessary steps to estimate (a) the entire cost of pro-     duction  including rent, rates, cultivation etc, and (b) the amount     of  sound potatoes which would ultimately be harvested having regard     to  the incidence  of disease and  to the other causes of normal     wastage; and upon the evidence thus obtained proceeded to fix such     prices for the sound ware and sound undersized potatoes as would     give the growers  a reasonable profit not only upon the sound     potatoes but upon the total cost of production of the entire crop,,     Since in normal practice the farmer does not dispose of his potato     crop at  the time  when it is taken from the ground, but clamps and     disposes of the clamped potatoes at intervals extending from     November to the following June and since the wastage due to     disease  and other causes is spread over the period of delivery,     the Commission provided for a rising scale of prices upon the     potatoes which would become deliverable from month to month, so     that as  wastage accrued the prices automatically increased.U        Apart from the claim that the Ministry should pay a separate     price  or1 blighted potatoes iri addition irt such sum as is include     ed  in respect  of  loss by blight  in the price fixed by the     Commission for sound ware potatoes, it is also claimed that in     some cases loss of potatoes has  been occasioned by neglect or     delay on the part of the Ministry in taking delivery.  The     Ministry are prepared to accept  responsibility in any case in     which such default on their part can be shown to be the effective
cause of loss, but as regards the claim of certain growers for specialcompensation in respect of their blighted potatoes where there has been no default on the part of the Ministry, the Department cannot recogniseany responsibility in the matter.  The exact position is set out in fullin the attached memorandum,(Potato Blight 1918-1919),     At the same time the Ministry recognises that the temporary anduneven development of blight may cause,  very serious hardship to someindividuals &quot;/ho have grown potatoes this year at the request of theGovernment,  Where, for instance, the whole or a large part of a farmer&apos;,crop has been affected, he will naturally not be materially assisted bythe increase in the price of sound ware potatoes,  Tho Ministry of Poodare prepared accordingly, not as a matter of legal right but with a viewto preventing serious hardship^ to consider favourably any application                                                       under potatoesfrom a farmer who can prove that he increased his acreage/lnis year andthat taking his crop as a whole, he has, without fault of his own,incurred ah actual loss.  In such cases the Ministry propose, subject tothe consent of the Treasury,  to make good the loss.                    1     On the question of the disposal of sound ware potatoes, it isnecessary for the Ministry to take all possible steps to find a market,.The most promising outlet at the moment is  rW the occupied territorieson the left bank of the Rhine,  Subject to Treasury sanction it is pro-posed to offer 100,000 tons of potatoes to the Germans for the occupied territory.   The only other fresh outlet that can be seer is that theFrench might take another 15,000 tons a month in Mediterranean Ports.In each case it will be necessary to press the Ministry of Shipping totake special steps for the provision of tonnage.     It may be added that the figures received hitherto do not suggestthat there  has been any exceptional delay in removing potatoes.  already the removal of potatoes from farms in England and  ales exceed by 19,000 tons the removals effected by this date in the previous. us season,*&apos;hile the total excess of production does not exceed 620,000 tons.The export  from Ireland has also been increased,  Ilo figures are yet available for Scotland,                                                GE0* H,  ROBERTS.     Ministry of Food,       10th March, 1919,
                     Potato Blight 1918-19     Owing to the wet season of 1!?18 and to the difficulties ofobtaining sufficient labour on the farms the loss occasioned to&apos;pot&amp;trC*-growers by the incidence of blight has been considerable, and serious losses may be incurred in some parts of the country by the rotting ofclamped potatoes from this cause..   Under these circumstances aconsiderable number of potato growers are now putting forward a claim that all losses due to blight should fall upon the Ministry of Pood,and that the potato farmers are entitled to be paid for all potatoeswhich  were sound on the 1st November, 1918, no matter what may have happened to those potatoes since that date.     There are other claims made b y the potato growers against theMinistry of Food with regard to loss occasioned by delay on the partof the Ministry in taking delivery  of the potato crop within areasonable period of time, but this Memorandum deals,only with the contention of the potato growers  that the destruction of the potatoessince the 1st  November, 1918 by  reason of  blight ought to be a lossof the Ministry and not of the producer,.     The question mainly if not entirely  depends upon the constructionof certain documents issued from  time to  time  giving pledges or promisesto the potato groY/ers  on the part of the  Ministry1.&apos;   The first material document  is the circular  issued  on  the1st January,-  1918  (Potatoes 9) announcing (1)  the  intention of  theGovernment to enter  into forward  contracts  for sound ware potatoes,and  (2) the  intention  of the food Controller,  as  from  the 1st   Hovember1918, to purchase  the  entire crop of  potatoes, with  the  followingexceptions,  namely?            (a)  Potatoes grown  on  holdings including  less than  one                statute acre  of potatoes..             (b)  Potatoes growni  for the grower&apos;3  consumption,  or  for                 consumption on&apos; the grower*s farm.             (c)  Potatoes grown for experimental purposes.      As regards  the  crop so to be purchased,  that circular  announced that  the  purchase  price would be  eventually assessed with due  regard to  the  size  of  the crop and the  quality of potatoes, but for sound potatoes  would not be  less than the scale therein mentioned.
     The prioes for seed and under-sized potatoes would be announced In due oourse.  Price, weight and conditions wouldbe determined when delivery was taken.    Subject to proper precaution having been taken, the PoodController would bear the risk of damage other than normalwastage.2,    It is clear from this document that with the exceptionbefore referred to the entire crop of potatoes was to be purchased,and it is no doubt arguable that the entire potato crop would include potatoes in any state of unsoundness whether proceedingfrom blight or otherwise.  But as it was expressly provided thatthe purchase price would eventually be assessed with due regardto the quality of the potatoes and that the condition was tobe determined at the date when delivery was taken, the circularimposed no obligation upon the Pood Controller to pay forblighted or unsound potatoes as though they were -sound.     If under the notice of the 1st January there is a promise to purchase unsound or blighted potatoes, the only correspondingobligation is to pay for them at their market value as blightedor unsound potatoes.     Oil the 19th July, 1918 in pursuance of the policy announced by the circular of the 1st January, a Potatoes (Growers1 Prices)Commission was appointed to fix the prices to be paid to growersfor potatoes other than those sold as seed.     In October, 1918, before the Potato 5 rowers Prices commission had.reported, a leaflet was issued by the Ministry, L.G. Potatoes4, for the guidance of growers.  Clause?7,8, and 9 were as follows:     7. You should be paiyi by the purchaser for potatoes within     14 days of delivery the price per ton fixed for your district     by the Joint Commission of the Ministry of Pood and Board.,     of Agriculture.   The price will be fixed and announced at     an early date.     8,  The price referred to in para. 7 13 for sound marketable     ware potatoes dressed over the riddle fixed for your district.     You are not permitted fed dress your crop over a smaller     riddle than this.,    9, You will be at liberty to sell seed or undersized potatoes    or blights at the best price obtainable subject to the    operation of a maximum price. The Ministry of Pood will    purchase only the surplus of these potatoes at a price to be    determined by the Joint Commission,
   A certain proportion of blighted potatoes in any yearTscrop though unsuitable for human consumption,  command a marketat some price for feeding to cattle.   Para*Q of the leaflet L.G.  Potatoes 4 gave the farmer  liberty to sell seeds, undersized and blights at the best price  which hecould procure (subject t* a maximum price)  without having to account for any profit he might realise over and above theprice which might be subsequently fixed by the Potatoes(Growers1 Prices) Commission.    Paragraphs ii and 15 of tlje same leaflet contained thefollowing instruction:    (14) ; If your potatoes are not keeping well you should  write    at onoe to the Zonal Committee or Potato Control Committee  for    your zone, who will have your potatoes inspected, and will    make arrangements for delivery to be taken at an early  date if    this Is necessary to prevent the potatoes from being wasted.    You must remember, however, that growers cannot expect  to    dispose of the whole of their potatoes during the first few    months of the season, and that other grev/ers beside  yourself    wish to market their crop,    (15) You must take every precaution to see that your potatoes    are pitted or plamped properly, and if you have not  been    accustomed to pit potatoes hitherto you should seek  the expert    advice of potato growers who will be able to advise  you.  You    should inspect the clamps or pits periodically, and  if  there    are any signs that the potatoes are not keeping well you    should at once telegraph or write to your Zonal Committee or    Potato Control Committee informing them of the facts.  The    Ministry of Pood will bear loss arising from damage  other than    normal wastage only If you have pitted your potatoes properly,    and if you have given at least 7 days1 notice that the  potatoes    will go wrong if they are not removed quickly.3.,  On the 18th October, 1918 the Potatoes (Growers1 Prices)Commission issued their report.  At that date blight had already made Its appearance in the potato crop in various parts  of thecountry and the Commission received evidence with regard to theexistence of blight before settling its report.    For the purpose ef their enquiries the Commission sent to allthe principal growers forms to be filled up for the purpose of                 estimatedshowing the average/cost of growing one acre of potatoes in 1918.The growers were requested to give particulars of their expenses,the cost of cultivation, both before and after planting, and toestimate the average crop of sound ware potatoes per acre socultivated.
    It  would appear from the  form  of  enquiry  thus adopted  that thoCommission from the commencement of their  enquiry intended to base&apos;their prices upon a consideration, ( 1)  of  the total  crops  of sound warepotatoes  that would in fact bo produced and (2)  upon the total oast of rent, rates, taxes and cultivation of the  ?;hole  acreage planted  withpotatoes, Incurred for the purpose of producing  the  crops,    This  is borne out  by the  way in which  the prioes vrere  actually fixed in the  Commission^ Report*   The Commission commence their Report asfollows:-           &quot;We now beg to present  our unanimous  Report; as the results    of  our enquiry j and v/e give in the Schedules annexed hereto  the    prices we have fixed for  the Potato Crop  of  1918 produced in    England and Wales,nNo. prioe  was put upon  blighted, diseased or unsound  potatoes of  any kind^The prices fixed for sound ware potatoes rose bj periodic  increments of10/&quot; per  ton over the  total period fixed for  delivery, and it wasexpressly provided that j-            11 The increments fixed  in  the above schedule must be  accepted    as  covering compensation  to the grower for wastage and loss, in pits    and for deferred delivery* Price weight  and condition are to be    determined in accordance  with  the scales  set out above as at the    date  when delivery is taken.   Wo  grower ia entitled to claim further    compensation for any losses save  those which are quite exceptional    in  character.  In  such oases it will be the  duty of the grower, when    making application for compensation to satisfy the Government that.-             1) the site of the pit has been  properly chosen.             2; the potatoes  were  in  sound condition when  pitted, &amp;             3) due oare was  exercised in  constructing the pits  and in    examining the condition of their  contents from time to time/&apos;    The price of all undersized   potatoes was fixed at  3 per ton^r for all areas and for  all periods  of  the season.    The Potatoes Prices Commission expressly  stated  in their report that they had  visited the separate districts, w&amp; heara local evidence sub- iltted  by representative witnesses of growers, had inspected the potato Tops in  the various districts and had heard  representative witnesses on &amp;matters relating to oost of production, estimated yields and to  the jcidence of the various potato diseases throughout  England and  Wales?    It  is therefore clear that in  fixing the  prices  to be  paid for the earrs  crop of sound ware potatoes the Commissioners had taken into  count the incidence  of blight in 1918, had  considered Its effect upon pe estimated yields of the crops, and had fixed the prices for  sound  re potatoes at such  a level as to include compensation for all losses  ioh would be occasioned by  the  incidence of disease.
4. On the  1st November,  a  form was  issued to the  farmers,through the Divisional Pood  Commissioners (Potatoes  A.0.68 a)which required the  growers to estimate the respective quantitiesof sound ware potatoes remaining on the farm or holding  onNovember 1st and also the  estimated amount of  under-sizedpotatoes *5. That tho  Lincolnshire growers understood at the time  thebasis upon which the Commission^ prices had been arrivedat is shown by a Resolution  passed at a meeting of farmers and small holders at Spalding  on Tuesday, November 5th,  which contained  the following  passage:-       &quot;In consequence of  the development and continuance of       blight the  estimate of yield then presented (to the       Commission)  has been found to be much higher than the       facts  warrant.  The price appears to have been based       on the tested v/eight  of the present crop.  The testod       vreight will  be  far  above the actual weight delivered,       in some  cases up  to 30ft.&quot;   And in December  1918, in view of representations made byLincolnshire farmers with regard to blight and other matters affecting the cost  of  production, an increase of price wrs madoin Lincolnshire and certain other counties.  These increased prices appeared In the  schedule of the Potatoes  (Consolidation)Order, No. 29  dated 12th December, 1918.     The following is  an extract from the Lincolnshire, Bostonand Spalding Free  Press, of December 24th, 1918:-       UA feeling  of gratification was prevalent at a meeting       of the General Committee of - the Holland Formers1 Union       at Spalding on Tuesday, that  as tho result of their       effort,  tho  Food  Controller had given the farmers of       Lincolnshire an  additional 10/- per ton  on their potatoes       This  means  as stated in the column last week, roughly       an extra  200,000 in Holland; not. as the farmer.contends        in extra profit,  but in mitigation of the losses he hau        suffered through blight.&quot;   In a Press Notice issued by the Food Controller (P.N. 746)announcing the  increase  of prices in Lincoln, Norfolk Cambridgeand Hunts, Soke of Peterborough and Yorkshire the following passage occurs:-                                                   AT/
         &quot;At  the  same  time  it has &quot;been decided  in view  of the         abnormal  development of blight in the  Eastern  Counties         and  other special  circumstances  since  the date on which         the  growers^  prices were fixed by the  Joint  Commission  to         revise the growers prices  in the counties chiofly affected    The  fact that  the Increase of 10/- was in part at  ony rateintended to cover  losses  by  blight in excess of  tho lossescontemplated by the Commission is shown by a letter from theSecretary of the Holland  Farmers union, dated 28th December,sent to  the Ministry of Food, in which tho following passageappears j-         111 am directed  by  the Holland Fanners1 Union to          thank you for the  courtesy with which you rocontly          received our  deputation  on the question of the price          of potatoes in  Lines, and  for tho increase of 10/-          por  ton  whioh will bo very helpful in mitigating the          very serious  loss  which  is being suffered by the extensive          development of  blight.   Cur members are repeatedly writing          of their clamps falling  in as a result of the disease,          and  from a farm in Hoi beach  Marsh which was aligned by          your Inspectors, who based their estimate of about 10          tons an  acre  upon  this and other crops, not more than          one  ton  an acre of sound ware potatoes will be secured,&quot;6,  To sum up  the  effect  of  all  the  documents above referred to,it seems cloar that in  fixing  the  prices for the tot^l potato cropfor 1918 it  was the intention of  the Commission that the pricesfixed for Bound ware and  undersized  potatoes should afford thegrowers compensation for such losses and Y*aatage as are cu.ur.od byblight in a  normal year.     There appears no  reason to  doubt  .that in subsequentlygranting to the growers in  certain countioa an increase of 10/-por ton ovor and above the  prices  fixed by the Commission, the ministry were meeting representations  partly based upon theincrease of blight  ovor and above the  normal amount of blightwhich had thon become apparont,     fold finally^  there appears  no reason to doubt that at  the time when the potato prices *ere fised by the Commission,  :*nd at tho  time when those priCos  wore subsequently increased  the potatogrowers generally understood and accepted  tho bargain between themselves and the  Ministry In the sense  for which tho Ministry  now contend, end  which the potato growers  now seek to  repudiate.
