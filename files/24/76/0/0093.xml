POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT,  [March 5, 1919.]                                    FOREIGN  OFFICE.      (11064)                                                 SWITZERLAND/002.,\ Cj if7 .                   MEMORANDUM                         on recent POLITICAL CRISES IN SWITZERLAND. The following  Memorandum,  which is based on personal  observations during a recent     visit to Switzerland and on various official and press  reports,  aims at giving a     brief survey of the chief political problems which have been exercising the minds     of the  Swiss people during the last two or three months.     1. THE collapse of the  general strike  of November last in Switzerland had a salutary effect  on  the  leaders of advanced  Swiss  social democracy.  It  demonstrated first that the Swiss Government, in spite of  bad management of the preliminaries, was in a position, thanks to  the judicious manipulation  of the various  social and territorial uni&apos;s of the army, to crush any new strike which  might be  attempted ; secondly, that the  feeling  of the  bourgeois and  peasant  classes had  been rendered exceedingly hostile to   the principle of the strike.*  In the  present instance this  hostility was intensified by the death from the &quot;grippe&quot; of so many of the - soldiers  who had  to  be mobilised in consequence of the strike.   The memory of this is likely to be a long and bitter one, particularly in French and Italian-speaking Switzerland, and exceedingly  to the disadvantage of the Social Democratic party.     2.  When  the  General  Swiss  Social Democratic Conference  assembled on the 21st December last it was only  natural, in  view  of the foregoing considerations, that moderate opinion should prevail.  The  large French-Swiss  representation, which had apparently determined to vote solidly against the extremists, also assisted towards this result.   It was shown first  in the debate as to where the  future headquarters  of the party were to be.   The choice was between Berne, which is on the whole moderate and   opportunist,  and  Basle  or Zurich, where the pro-Bolshevist  element in the party is predominant.  In the course of the discussion  Zurich  withdrew, and in the ensuing vote  between  Berne and  Basle the  former  was  selected  by  106  votes to 78.     3.  The  next indication that the more  advanced members had been subdued  to reason was provided by the election for the presidency of the party.  The Zimmerwaldian, Robert Grimm, who, according to private information, had been extremely downcast at the failure  of the strike, was put forward but significantly opposed by  the French- Swiss  Socialist leader,  Paul  Graber,  who  had  behind  him  practically the  entire French-Swiss group.  &apos; Since Graber is in  his  views  by no means a moderate, and  had, in fact, been imprisoned  for and-militarist propaganda in May 1917, his  action  must be interpreted as a piece of pure opportunism.   The Neuchatel correspondent of the &quot; Neue Zurcher Zeitung &quot; (13th December, 1918)  was certainly correct  in reporting him as  entirely &quot;swayed by tactical considerations.&quot;  The  French-Swiss veto,  which Graber&apos;s action in fact imposed, was successful;  Grimm&apos;s  candidature  was defeated, and  Gustav Miiller, Mayor of  Berne,  and  in tactics, at  least,  a Moderate  Social Democrat, was  elected president of the party by 100 votes.     4.  Later in the course of the Congress the leader of the Bolshevik section,  Fritz Platten, secretary of the party, son of a naturalised German,  intimate friend of Lenin, a young and energetic man of 37 or 38, announced  his decision  to  resign  from office, a further indication that all was not going well with  the extremists.     5. At the Swiss Labour Congress on the two following-days, 22nd and 23rd December, the prevailing  note was also one of opportunism  and moderation.   Grimm made a   * The figures given by the non-Bolshevist Swiss Socialist, Hermann *Treulich, arguing against this actionare worth quoting.  His article is based  on the occupational census of 1910:-          1. Rural population, 340,000.          2. People of independent means in industry, commerce, and transport, 180,000.          3.

speech  in  favour  of opportunist  political  action, and  in  a later  debate the formerextremist  Social Democratic  deputy, Charles  Naine, whose  pamphlet  &quot;Dictature duProletariat ou Democratic &quot; should be noted here, pointed to the moral of the failure ofthe genera] strike.   PI attend speech, expressing  the  opinion  that  Swiss labour  mustchoose between revolution and evolution, and leaving no doubt that the former  was hischoice, was an exception.     6.  The satisfaction of the non-Socialist press at the  discomfiture of the  extremistswas in proportion to the anger of the pro-Bolshevist papers.  In particular the Zurich&quot; Volksrecht&quot; called for the  working out  of  a revolutionary programme on Russianlines;  namely, the concentration of power in the Workers&apos;  and Soldiers&apos; Councils and arevolutionary strike, followed by the socialisation of banks, productive industry, land,and commerce.     7.  The same section of the Swiss Social Democratic press and party from whichthis communist  programme emanated began,  at the beginning of January  1919, to protest against the idea of the International Socialist Conference at Lausanne, whichwas the  place first proposed.  In  this connection it is interesting to note that  theConference, from  the  moment that  it was suggested,  was  subject to a cross-fire of criticism.  On the one hand the Bolshevists opposed  it,  since they  said it was inspired by  the Entente and composed  of &quot; Sozialpatrioten&quot; like Plenderson, Branting, and,Albert Thomas; on the  other hand  the French-Swiss non Socialist press opposed  it,under  the  impression  that  it was in some way a piece  of Bolshevist propaganda^The latter was the reason why the meeting-place of the Conference  was transferredto Berne.     8.  The holding of the International Socialist Conference at Berne was preceded bya crisis in the  Swiss  Social Democratic party, which, during the first two or three weeks of February, was the subject of grave consideration in Swiss non-Socialist circles.   Itwas brought about at an extraordinary party congress called to decide on the questionof  whether the Swiss  Social Democratic party should  participate   in  the  BerneConference.  As has been mentioned, the pro-Bolshevist  section were from the beginningopposed to all  idea of taking part.   In the words of the &quot; Berner Tagwacht,&quot; now underthe editorship of the extremist, Hans Vogel, not Robert Grimm, they regarded it as aConference which,     &quot; built up out of the ruins of  the old Internationale, on the same  foundations and    with the self-same materials, will, like former conferences, end in resolutions w-hich    mean nothing, and will be entirely innocent of what the  working  class has been    waiting for  in. vain for nearly  four years : the word to go forward to battle.....    It will not,  like Zimmerw^ald and Kienthal, constitute the point of departure for a    revolutionary  movement .... it is not the rubbish-heap of the old Internationale    that will produce the spirit that  is to vivify the class-war of the proletariat.&quot;The comments of the  other leading  pro-Bolshevist organs, the  Zurich &quot;Volksrecht&quot;and the Basle  &quot; Vorwarts,&apos;&apos; were in similar  terms.  Gustav Miiller, the newly-electedpresident of the  party, was in favour  of participation, and  had,  in  fact, in a letter toMr. Henderson, offered his collaboration.    9. The extraordinary party Congress was  held in the morning and  afternoon ofthe  2nd February.    The  Party  Directorate (&quot; Parteivorstand&quot;)  had recommendedparticipation and Charles Naine moved a resolution to this effect.  Thereupon Schneider,editor  of the  extremist Basle &quot;Vorwarts,&quot; moved a  long  resolution in a contrarysense,  declaring for  the immediate  convocation of the  Zimmerwald and KienthalConferences with their programme of class-war.   Platten moved to add an extremistdeclaration to Schneider&apos;s resolution,  welcoming the Russian and German revolutionsand summoning  the proletariat to universal  revolt.   This addition was  carried,  in face of the  opposition of Schneider himself, by 198 votes to  154, and the double resolution passed by 238 to 147.   The immediate result  was the resignation of Gustav Miiller.from the presidency  and the election  in his  place  of  Reinhard, a Zimmerwaldian, andof Eugen Munch, also an extremist, to the vacancy on the executive committee.     10.  The  Platten-Schneider  resolution practically  committed the Swiss SocialDemocratic party  to a policy of Bolshevism.   Those who opposed  it, for example, the moderate, Jacques Schmid, editor of the &quot; Neue Freie Zeitung,&quot; of  Often,  subsequentlyattempted  to explain it away on  the ground  that  the Conference was suddenly    * An interesting&apos;  and  cynical account of the propagandist activities of the Bolshevist Mission inSwitzerland, as given in a report to  the Soviet Government by Jean Bersine, the  Bolshevist Minister, wasreprinted from the Moscow  &quot; Lsvestia&quot;  of  the 27th November in Swiss Socialist papers  of about tho-5th January.
convoked, and was  therefore unrepresentative  of the  party as  a whole.   Colour wasgiven to this explanation by the fact that of the 565 sections of the party  385 were unable to participate, but this on analysis is seen to  be not so  strong  as it appears.The 180 sections were represented by 462 delegates,  who attended on  behalf of26,726  members, almost two-thirds  of  the  total party membership.   If  lack of truerepresentation of the party as a whole is brought in,to the discussion the anti-extremistdecisions of December last might, with more justice, be ascribed  to the same cause, ason that occasion, as has been mentioned,  the French-Swiss delegates, practically allanti-Bolshevik  for  tactical  reasons, were  in great  force,  and  voted  wirh  completesolidarity.   The truth seems to be  that  Platten&apos;s  forceful  speech and his  scorn  ofopportunism carried  a great part  of  his  audience  away, and so brought about a crisis in the party ranks, which far-seeing observers  had for some time recognised to be inevitable.     11. Non-Socialist circles were considerably alarmed at the decision, which lias hadthe effect of stimulating  bourgeois  anti-Bolshevist and anti-general strike  measures.From the Commandant of the Civic Guard in Geneva I learned  that his  company,.which was formed and rendered good service during  the  general strike of november last, in keeping going work of national importance,  and in protecting workers who didnot wish to strike, had not  been disbanded, but was on a regular  voluntary  basis,ready for any emergency.   Finally, in this  coiinection  should be noted the  increasedvigilance and prudence of the Swiss authorities.   During  the  last weeks of january and  the first weeks  of February numerous arrests or deportations  of prominent  ornotoriously  dangerous agitators  were made with nothing but good,  effect  as  far  as could be observed.*   The Swiss  army transport too has  recently been reorganised soas to make  mobilisation,  should it again  be  required, independent of the railways,which, with the extreme shortage  of coal and  possibility of breakdown, are likely tobe unreliable in an emergency.     The conclusion one would draw is that the crisis in the Swiss Social Democraticparty is likely to  have a more serious effect on party unity than  on the fortunes of the swiss people as a whole, so long, that is, as  food  shortage and  unemployment do  not reach a  dangerous stage.     1. Next to the decision of the Swiss Social Democrats  I  found such Swiss opinon as I was able to observe most agitated on the  question of the attachment of German-Austria to Germany.  The German-Austrian elections, with  their apparently decisivevote in favour of adhesion to Germany, had not yet been held, but the  result was  not considered to be in doubt  by anyone I consulted in the matter  except M. Haguenindirector of the Bureau de Presse frangais, in Berne, and  Dr.  Eugen Fischer, editor-in-charge, in Dr. Gottfried Baumberger&apos;s absence,  of the  Erzbergerian &quot;Neue ZurcherNachrichten.&quot;  Although  the former represents, of course, general. French  opinion  andthe latter that of pro-Austrian Catholic circles, it may be interesting  to  record theirviews.     2. M. Haguenin  was  of opinion that the union of German-Austria with Germany,which he considered a great menace to France, could  be  prevented by judicious diplo-matic and economic  action on  the part of the Entente.   Except  among the social democrats, where it existed for purely party reasons, he had found during his recent visit to Vienna (he left about the 20th January) a real desire for the union, but  saidthat hard economic facts would force even these opponents to recognise its  inevitabilityvery soon.   Important Czech and Jugo-Slav circles were  anxious  to come to terms with german-Austria with the  object of preventing the union.     On my enquiring whether French opinion as a whole  feared and wished to oppose the union, M. -Haguenin replied that certain extreme French nationalists even desired tosee it take effect,  as  then a pretext would be provided  for extensive compensatoryannexations on the Rhine and in Poland.     3. Dr. Fischer showed me an article or memorandum which  he  had received froman Austrian (I afterwards  gathered  that this was  Herr Rasim,  nephew of PrinceLiechtenstein) urging the  danger to Europe  of the  annexation to Germany of German-Austria.   I gathered  from Dr. Fischer that several of the Christian Socialists, whomthe economic factor, coupled with  German  Centre  party propaganda, was forcing fromtheir original position of antagonism to the union, were putting forward an alternative proposal of a perpetually neutral Danubian Federation.    * Platten left for Russia towards the end of February.  It will be interesting- to see what occurs whenhe returns.                                                    *
     1. The third critical problem which is agitating the minds of the  Swiss politicians; is that of Switzerlaud&apos;s relation to the  League  of Nations.  Under the presidency of M. Calonder, Switzerland of all the smaller neutrals during the war  most clearly and,; definitely  declared herself in favour of the  League  of Nations, and M.  Calonder&apos;s own speech  on the subject in June last was a very important contribution from the neutral nations&apos; point of view to the discussion of the subject.     2. Swiss relation to the proposed League was  one  of the  subjects uppermost in M. Ador&apos;s  mind when he Vent to  Paris  oh  the  20th January last.   Before departing- he expressed to Sir Horace Rumbold the view that  he had impressed on his colleagues, namely, that Switzerland  must give up her  traditional policy of disinterestedness in events going on outside her borders.     3.  On M. Ador&apos;s return he again saw Sir  Horace Rumbold at Berne, who reported: that he did not seem quite  satisfied  with his discussions in  Paris.  His principal&apos; concern was the fundamental difficulty of reconciling Switzerland&apos;s  entry into  the League of  Nations with her position of a perpetually neutral  and independent State. He found,  so it was reported from another source, that &quot; the idea of neutrality was not very  sympathetically  received  among  the Allies,&quot; a  fact  for which certain corre- spondence  in the Swiss  press, for example, a letter from M.  Leon Bourgeois which appeared in the &quot;Neue Ziircher Zeitung&quot;  for the 8th  January, must have prepared him.   Nevertheless, from a further  remark by  the  President  to Sir Horace Rumboldthat the giving up of  neutrality would mean the end of Switzerland as an  independent, nation, it was clear that the utmost efforts would be made to justify.Switzerland&apos;s point of view to the Powers represented at the Peace Conference.     4. On the  12th February there was published the text of an official Swiss project for the League  of Nations  drawn  up by a special commission appointed by the Federal    * Coloured perhaps, too, by  conversations with French authorities; M. Martin had recently returned from Paris.    t Since this was written twenty-two more communes have voted in favour of incorporation, but there isno way of determining the size of majorities.     4. The purely  Swiss  point of view&apos;v  was  represented  by M. William  Martin,foreign editor of the &quot;Journal  de Geneve,&quot;  with whom I had a long conversation onthe various political problems affecting  Switzerland.  Quite spontaneously  M. Martinnamed the question  of the union of German-Austria with Germany as one of thosewhich most critically affected  the future of his  country,   ft implies three clangers toSwitzerland racial,  military,  and  economic.  In spite of the self-consciously  Swisscharacter of the German-speaking Swiss, many  Swuss fear that the attraction  of ;a&apos;h&apos;ethnically  united  &quot; Grossdeutschland&quot;  may result in the setting  up of a  Ger maniairredenta within Swiss borders.  The strong race-consciousness  of  the present regime in both Gennanv and German-Austria has been noted with considerable misgiving, and&apos;the fear that a Great Germany  may wish to absorb the German-speaking population ofSwitzerland may prompt a request for  renewed  recognition by the Powers of  Swissneutrality, independence, and territorial inviolability.     5. On the  military and economic side the seriousness of the situation for Switzeh-land is in general sufficiently  obvious.   A still greater menace, however, is considered to be offered  by the  possible annexation to Germany of only one province of German-Austria,  namely, Voralberg, leaving the remainder free to join a Danuhian Federation.Opinion in Switzerland in favour of the union of  Voralberg with herself  seems to havevanished, and the enthusiasm  of  some  of the German-Swiss  Catholic papers  for the vote in  favour  of the  union  in a few communes (18,  the total being 103f) is nowseen to have been  rather  hollow, and at all events premature.   Should.- how ever, the;union with Germany of Voralberg, where  Bavarian propaganda  is  reported to be very active, take place, and  not the  complete union of German-Austria with  Germany, one has the impression that even the French-speaking and Protestant Swiss would press forthe  annexation  of the province.   They would otherwise be cut off by a small strip ofGerman territory, and the Arlberg railway, the chief means of communication between.east and  west, would be in  the  hands of a powerful empire.   This, the Swiss consider,is an eventuality to be foreseen and guarded against.     6. What, in short, would serve Swiss interests best would be a Danubian confederation-tion including Voralberg, and many important circles in Switzerland are  apparentlywaiting for a sign  from the Entente in  favour of this  solution of a problem  which hasa very vital bearing on their economic and political future.
     I&apos;   m       &apos;                                 -                                        5Council in September last and called together on the 4th November.  This document was  transmitted through  Swiss  diplomatic  channels  to all  the Governments withaccredited representatives at the Peace Conference.  It should be carefully distinguished from the various unofficial projects which  have been  noted from time to time recently.These are frequently associated with the names of such  suspect pacifists as Dr. Jongvan  Beek  en  Donk and  Dr.  R. Broda and  others,  and should  be  dismissed  aspropaganda.     .5.  The official Swiss document is in three parts :            (a.)  :&apos; Avant-projet d&apos;un Pacte federal de Ligue des  Nations,&quot;  drawn  up                    by the Commission.           (b.)  &quot; Memorandum relatif a la Neutrality de la  Suisse,&quot;  presented by the                    Federal Council.           (c.)  &quot; Rapport concernant un Projet d&apos;un  Pacte.  de Ligue  des Nations,&quot;                    drawn up by the Commission.     6.  The &quot; projet&quot; falls into two subdivisions :      (a.) &quot;Le Pacte fedCral.&quot;     (6.) &quot; Le Statut constitutionnel.&quot;     In the first, which it is proposed should only be alterable by agreement, the mostimportant paragraph is that (article 6) which fixes the seat of the permanent institutions of the  League  of  Nations on the territory of  the  Swiss Confederation and on theterritory of other States not named, which &quot; by their history and peace policy also offerdurable guarantees of impartiality.&quot;     In view of the subsequently published project of  the Entente, the details of the  Statut constitutionnel &quot; have little practical interest, though it may be worth notingthat the executive machinery of the League is proposed to consist  of the following :-         (a.) Un Conseil de Mediation.         (6.)  Une Cour internationale de Justice.          (c.) Une  Cour de Conflitsv         (d.) Une  Conference des Etats.         (e.)  Une  Chancellerie.     7. The most important part of the whole document, however, from the point of view of the present memorandum, is that which relates to the-neutrality of Switzerland. There are  two courses open  by which the incompatibility between the maintenance  of Swiss neutrality and Switzerland&apos;s full entry into the League of Nations might be surmounted. The first is the full recognition by the League of Nations of Swiss neutrality as defined by  the Congress  of Vienna; the  second  is  the  acceptance  of economic action as Switzerland&apos;s  contribution  to the executive force of  the League.   Both  concessions could be very much facilitated if the Confederation,  as the Swiss  project proposes, were made the headquarters  of the League, as it is the headquarters  of several other inter- national organisations such  as the International Red  Cross  and the Universal Postal Union.  Several - British advisory authorities on  the  League of Nations, and possibly also American, are  in favour of  putting the permanent institutions of the League in Geneva, a solution  which, while considerably  increasing Switzerland^  reponsibilities, would also remove the critical difficulty which has here been discussed.
