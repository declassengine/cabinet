FOOD PRODUCTION SCHEMES,  IRELAND.Memorandum prepared in compliance with Ohief  Secretary&apos;o              Minute of 17th March,  1917.Week onded 5th March, 1919.i          The following is a briefDepartment during the past week in production in Ireland!-statement on tho work of thofurtherance of increased Food                   LOANS FOR AGRICULTURAL IMPLLHliiNTS.  -          The number of applications received during the past week is 63, and the total value of machinery ordered from the beginning ofthe present year,to date, under the scheme,  amounts to  11,015,          Compared with the corresponding month In 1918, tho numbercf applications received during the past sabnth (266) shtwc praotioallyno falling off.   The demand is in respect cf the usual ceasonalimplements, ploughs, harrows, cultivators, drill hoes, &amp;o.          Merchants are now fairly prompt in supplying to theDepartments orders, and the vexatious delays which o&amp;curred in 1917and in 1910 have almost completely disappeared.                         TILLAGE SECTION.          The work  cf examining the Tillage Inspectors&apos; reports onholdings inspeotsd  under the Regulations mado by the Department underthe Third Schedule  cf the Corn Production Act, 1917, has been resumedduring the week.    This 1B with a viow to the selectitn cf suitableoases in which action might bo taken to exatt the penalty proscribedUnder the Third  Schedule in the caso of occupiers who have failed,without reasonable  caus*, to cultivate the minimum  tillage portions ofthoir holdings in 1913,                    PROGRESS OF FARM  WORK.           Tho weather during tho weok was ideal for outdoor workand afforded farmers an opportunity of making up some of the arrearsin thoir ploughing work.  On the larger farms ploughing is,  however,still backward ao oomparod with previous years, owing to tho wotseasen, disturbed labour conditions, oto.   Work is mere advanoedin th&amp; caso of small farms, on many of whioh&apos;preparations for timelysowing aro being mado.           The season has been unfavourable for the sowing of wheat and it  Is anticipated that the aroa under this cereal will be lessthan that of last year.   Planting of potatoes was begun during theweek in early districts, especially in Counties Cork and Dublin.5/3/19.
                     CAULK  FINDING  STUFFS.               Owing to increased  supplies  of &quot;maize  and.  mlllere&apos;&quot; offalsrecently made available,  farmers in moot districts appear to bo  ableto procure sufficient quantities of these feeding stuffs for cattle,Tho demand for feeding cakes and weals,  which are relatively high in price?  slackened  appreciably during the past month.                         F  L   A   X,                          .......- &quot;*&apos;.....*........-............yiax Grading,   During tho past  week further renortd wore receivedBy&quot;&apos;the Department indicating that farmers are  dissatisfied with thestandard of grading,  This matter has been brought under tho noticecf the Flax Supplies Committee of the Ministry of Munitions and it isunderstood that they are investigating the cause of the dissatisfaction ffelJj for Flaxseofl.   Farmers are still showing very littledisposition to purchase seed,  and it is improbable thero will bo keenbuying until the commencement of the sowing season, .Labour.    In some mills in County Armagh tho soutchers havo&quot;threatened to refuse to scutch tow at tho rates ftxod by the WagesCourt.   Tho Department are giving this matter their attention, and hope to have an amicable settlement arrived at,Flax Grewing in 1919,  From the reports received by the Department&apos;s  -Flax Seed Inspectors and Flax Instructors, it would appear that therewill be a substantial reduction in the area sown under flax thisseason,  The principal factors leading&apos; to such a reduction aro (1)the relatively high&apos;cost of labour for flax work, and (8) the fearof labour difficulties which prevail at present.   These factorsaffect principally  the farmers who grew relatively large areas of flax in 1910,       ESTIMATE OF.  THE NUMBERS OP LIVE STOCK OK 1st FEBRUARY,1919,          Tho usual bi-monthly estimate of the numbers of live stockin Ireland prepared by the Statistics and Intelligence Branch  of  theDepartment  (in connection with similar figures for Groat Britaincompiled by  the Beards of Agriculture for England and Scotland),  was issued on the 8&amp;th  ultimo.,          Tho estimate is based  on returns received from about50;000 representative holdings  (about 6 per cent  of tho totalnumber in Ireland),          According to the  latest estimate; while  the number of cowsin milk on  the 1st  February shows the usual seasonal decrease  in comparison  with  tho number  on 1st  December preceding; and  the numbercf cows in-calf  but not  in milk  shows a corresponding  increase, thetotal  Dairy Herd, 1,572,000,13  1.6 per oent greater than  on 1stDecember, but  somewhat less than at  tho corresponding  date(1st February) a  year ag-v,   The total number  of  cattle,,  4,623,000..  ia
