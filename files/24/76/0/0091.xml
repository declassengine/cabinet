Wise, C.B., as his delegate  on theSupreme Economic Council on matters other than the  administration of the BritishRelief Fund.  He lias appointed Sir William Goode, K.B.E., as his delegate for theadministration of the British Relief Fund.    Mr. Wise and Sir William Goode will  also be the Food  Controllers representa-tives,  with the  same  division of functions,  in  the  Food  Section of the  supreme economic Council.    Lord Robert Cecil has also appointed Sir William Goode to act under himself as british Director of Relief Missions.    Supreme Economic Council. The following  is a summary of the arrangementsagreed upon by the Associated Governments for the supply of food to Germany  at con-ferences held with representatives of the German Government at Brussels betweenMarch 13th and 16th :-    The Associated Governments will deliver to  Germany the food now available inEurope for which payment has been arranged  as soon as Germany shows her genuineintention to carry out her obligations by sending to sea for that purpose the ships tohe  selected hy  the Associated  Governments.   The  Associated Governments willprovide (as  quickly  as transportation can  be arranged)  or will give  permits for imports from neighbouring  countries for  the balance of the 270,000 tons  agreedupon  as soon as the ships  already named by the Germans as being ready have beensent to sea, and as soon as payment for such food  has been arranged.    The  German  Government  will have the right  to  purchase and  import  each month until September  1st  not more  than 70,000 tons of fats  and  300,000 tons ofbreadstuffs or their equivalent in other foodstuffs.   This provision places no restriction on  the import  of fish caught in European waters or  of  vegetables  obtained  fromneutrals.   The present restrictions upon German  fishing in the Baltic will be removedat once.    Germany must pay for the food provided by the Associated Governments and thepermissible methods of payment have been prescribed in detail.    Germany will he permitted to export commodities (except those to be enumerated in a prohibited list) to any neutral or other approved destination.  The proceeds fromthese exports, however, must be converted into payments for foodstuffs.    When the German ships are delivered, and subject to the continuous performanceby  Germany of the whole of her obligations in relation to this matter, the carriage ofGerman supplies will be a first charge upon their use.    As regards the provisioning of the left bank  of the Rhine, the German authorities will from, time to time present  statements showing that  the  rations in the occupied territories and  in  the rest  of  Germany are approximately equivalent.  The finaldecision as to the fair division of food between  occupied  and unoccupied territoriesshall rest with the Associated Governments, and the portion assigned  to the occupied territories shall be  paid for by the German Government.    The German Government will give facilities  and protection to shipments throughGerman ports and inland routes to Czecho-Slovakia and Austria, but the german delegates  at  Brussels have  expressed  the  view that shipments must arrive  for german account before such transportation  begins.   This, however, does not  affectthe present arrangements with regard to Poland via Dantzig.     The Associated  Governments  will appoint  representatives  forthwith who willmeet in a standing Commission at Rotterdam for the purpose  of  discussing with german delegates questions arising under this arrangement.     Inter-Departmental Committee on Food Prices. The Committee met on March J 9th.     It was decided that the price of imported meat should be reduced by 2d. per lb.on May 5th and by a further 2d. per lb. on June 30th.A (33)7.R7r-:!  l&apos;ki)  ISO a/19 K&amp;SA
     The decontrol of oils  and seeds, and  the  disposal of  the Ministry&apos;s stocks to the- trade were considered.  It appeared-     (a) that any profiteering by the trade would be prevented by the issue of a new            Maximum Prices Order, and export would for the  present be made only            with the sanction of the Ministry of Food.     (6) that so far as could  be foreseen, ample  supplies  would be  coming into this       :(W; country.          *                   ,v         r ,       -  --.-   -i     (c) that the prices at  which it&apos; was proposed to sell the stocks were as low as the            current trade would bear...........  - -.......     The Committee accordingly  approved the disposal  of the stocks at the prices proposed  in  each case,  subject-to the reservation, after  the  needs  of the  United Kingdom had been met,, of such quantities  as  the  Food  Controller might  decide should be sent to Germany.     Food Council. The Council met on March 13th and 18th.     In view of the accumulation of millers&apos; offals and the congestion of  the mills it was decided- -                                             . -     (1) that up to 10,000  tons should be exported at a price of not less than III. per            ton c.i.f. ;     (2) that, subject to Treasury  sanction, the price  of offals  in London should be            reduced on  March 24th  by not more than 21. per ton&quot;so long  as the            accumulation lasts. .    As regards feeding-stuffs, it was decided that the purchase of cake at  f.o.b. prices should be continued pending the issue of negotiations  with the Ministry of Shipping, and that the requisition of feeding-stuffs other than linseed and cotton cake and meal should not be continued after April 30th.   It was  also agreed to sanction the purchase ol 30,000 tons of rice meal from Burmah in addition to previous purchases.   ,:, The steps to be taken  for freeing the import and export of tea and for disposing of the Ministry&apos;s stocks were  considered.   It was  decided  to  re-open public auctions on May 5th under a scheme which will permit of the sale  of Government tea in conjunc- tion with private imports.  These sales wall be conducted monthly  until December 1919 when the Government stocks will have been disposed of and private imports will have become equal to or in excess  of the pre-war standard.   In order  to ensure stocks being  maintained in the United Kingdom, re-export  will be  limited to 7,000,000 lbs. per month.                            SUPPLIES AND DISTRIBUTION.     Meat. The increased allowance of meat to butchers has not been fully taken up and  in some areas the unconsumed portion is  considerable.   In  North Wales, for instance, the fresh meat supplied is at present sufficient to meet the  total demand.     Potatoes. The shipment of 100,000 tons of potatoes to the occupied territories of Germany on the left bank of the Rhine is nearing completion, and  steps are being taken  to obtain sufficient shipping to export  a  further 200,000 tons.  If this  can be done it is estimated that the whole of the exportable surplus of potatoes will have been disposed of.    Bacon, Hams and Lard. Shipments of bacon and hams from America during the past three weeks  have  amounted  only  to  14,505  tons, against  an  estimate for the period of 36,000 tons.    The Bacon,  Ham  and Lard (Distribution)  Order, 1917, is being suspended from the 31st March.   The  registration of customers with retailers will cease on that date and consumers will then be able to obtain lard,  bacon and ham free  of all restrictions. Home-produced bacon and ham, including Irish, however,  will remain  under the general supervision of the Ministry, in order to ensure a  fair distribution  of the available supplies.    Dried Fruits. The whole of the  32,000 tons of currants purchased  by the Ministry  has arrived   in  this country, but, owing to difficulties of transport, the distribution of  this supply  will not be  completed for a month.   The Ministry have agreed to take over from the Navy and Army Canteen Board their surplus stock  of dried fruits, and 780 tons of currants and sultanas have already been distributed from this source.    A further supply of 8,000 tons of dates has arrived.    Cocoa.-As imports of raw cocoa are in excess of consumption,  the allowance for re-export has been increased to 50 per cent, of  the total imports, provided that the balance is available for the distribution scheme. -   Scheme of Emergency Distribution. Measures for safeguarding food supplies inthe case of  a breakdown of transport due to labour troubles have been prepared, and
arrangements have also  been made for  the  reintroduction, if necessary,  of a strictsystem of rationing.               ORDERS UNDER DEFENCE OV THE REALM REGULATIONS.    An Order, dated 13th March 1919, revokes the Apricot Pulp-and Bitter OrangesOrder, 1917.  This Order was revoked  in December last  as regards  apricot pulp.The prohibition on dealings in bitter oranges outside the  United Kingdom is nowremoved.    The Freshwater  Fish Order, 1919, dated 18th March 1919, permits the sale inthis country of freshwater fish imported from abroad or from Scotland or Ireland,between March 15th  and  June 15th, 1919.    A. notice, dated  18th March  1919, revokes the Condensed Milk (Returns) Order,1917 ; the Condensed Milk (Distribution)  Order, 1918, and the directions thereunder;the Imported Canned Condensed Milk (Requisition)  Order,  1918;  and the CannedCondensed Milk (Requisition) Order, 1918.  The requisition of the output of  condensed milk  factories  in  Great  Britain  ceases on March  31st,  and after  May 31st cannedcondensed milk can  he sold without control, except that the maximum retail price is retained.    A general licence dated  1.9th March 1919, under  the Tea Retail Prices Order,1918, releases tea from restrictions as to retail prices on and from 24th March.    A general licence dated  19th March 1919, under the Cocoa Butter (ProvisionalPrices) Order, 1918,  and  the  Cocoa Butter (Requisition)  Order, 1918, releases cocoabutter from control  under these Orders  as to distribution  and prices as  from 17thMarch.             -                             ENFORCEMENT  OF ORDERS.     The  total number  of prosecutions  during  the  week  ended March  15th  was 1,004, of  which 929  resulted in convictions.             PART II. SUMMARY  OF  THE  FOOD POSITION.                                   IMPORTS.    The low imports recorded in recent weeks have been followed by still lower imports in the week ended March 15th the total imports of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs (97,900 tons) being less than those entered in any week since January 1918.  Everycommodity was below the average except sugar (29,800 tons), cocoa (4,100 tons) andcoffee (900 tons).  Amongst  the commodities  not  included  in  the  list  of principal foods there were substantial imports of  apples (8,600 tons), oranges (7,000 tons) andonions (9,600 tons), but no bananas.

After the exceptionally large deliveries of flour from the mills in the first two months of the year with the object of  building up local  stocks against possibletransport  trouble, the  delivery figure  (Table B  (1))   is again falling.  While theseexceptionally large deliveries were being made, it was necessary to use the imported flour available, so that the percentage of flour milled in the United Kingdom  in  the total quantity issued was only 78 per cent, as compared with 87 per  cent, in the correspond-ing eight weeks a year ago.  Of the imports into the country, however, the proportioncoming  in  as  flour in the first two months (21  per  cent.) is exactly half that of ayear ago.     Butchers  Meat. With the rise of prices to farmers at the beginning of the month,the supplies of cattle  and sheep  in markets in Great  Britain for the week  ended8th March were about  double  those of the &quot;preceding week.   Issues  of  refrigeratedmeat fell from  8,500  tons  to  6,700 tons, leaving  a net  increase of total supplies of5,800  tons.   Over a four-weekly period,  however,  total  consumption  shows littleincrease in spite of the increased ration and the supplies now available  for butchers! and Caterers in addition to the  ration quantity.  For the  four weeks ended 8th march the weekly total consumption  of  butcher&apos;s meat in  Great Britain is  estimated at 22,000 tons, or, of rationed meat alone, 17,700  tons.  The  net ration  quantity is 19,000 tons, but supplies  are  available  up  to 26,000 tons per week.   Thus present consumption of rationed meat is about  7 per cent, below the  ration quantity and 30 per cent, below the total quantity available.                                       STOCKS.     During the first week of the month of March stocks were again generally reduced: meat by 7,600 tons, or 8 per cent. ; bacon by  5,500  tons,  or 9 per cent.; cheese by 1,400 tons,  or 11 per cent., and butter by 2,300 tons, or 24 per cent. ; lard, eggs and condensed milk stocks were practically stationary, and there were slight  increases in the stocks of canned meat and canned fish.  Bacon stocks held  by the Ministry were reduced by 8,900 tons, or 20 per cent., owing mainly to  the transfer of  stocks to the Continent.                                       PRICES.      The wholesale price of  maize,  which fell from 90s.  per quarter to 70s. in the  week ended January 4th, fell from 70s. to 60s.  in the week  ended March 15th.
