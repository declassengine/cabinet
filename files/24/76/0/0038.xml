A comparison of the numbers  shown under I. and IV. for the 8 months does not therefore give  an accurate criterion of the vessels in Allied service at the different periods.    % &quot;Requisition&quot;.is here used  to mean  &quot;requisition  for full Government service.&quot;  The vessels shown as &quot;free fromrequisition &quot; therefore include the vessels that are requisitioned under the special liner requisitioning scheme :                       t  SPECIAL  LINER  REQUISITIONING  SCHEME:   .   All liner trades are now  requisitioned  under special conditions, which,  while leaving the vessels, still under the manage-ment of  their owners, and free so far as circumstances permit to accept private as well as Government cargo, secure that thevessels are operated on Government account, the owners being paid on a Blue Book basis.    II In addition to the figures here shown there are now included under  &quot; Trading for France and Italy &quot; respectivelyunder IV.

As these requireto be replaced in Norwegian service bj British vessels they do not represent additional vessels available for British service.    ^ Prize and detained vessels, previously shown separately under VII. on page 2, were from 31st July onwards included with ordinary vessels in their relative categories.
