The Nationalisation op Industries and Industrial Unrest.    The  question of the nationalisation of industries or industrial  undertakings is one&apos;which has  recently come  into great prominence in the world  of organised labour.  Ithas, of course, for a long time been a plank in the platform of many labour organisations,.industrial as well as political, but the disturbed conditions of the present time, coupled with the fact that, as a result of the termination of the war,&quot; denationalisation &quot; has been.and is being carried out to a considerable extent, has brought it so sharply into prominenceand given an opportunity  for driving it so well home into the minds of the rank and file at any rate  of trade union leaders that there would appear  to be little chance of its being allowed  to rest, anyhow in the near future.  It is, of course,  a leading feature ofthe miners&apos; demands, and  the  statement  attributed to  Mr.  Smillie in the &quot; WeeklyDispatch &quot;  of 23rd February, that &quot; if the Government is prepared to concede the principleof nationalisation of the mines, it is highly probable that the men would willingly waitthree months for the Report of the Commission of Enquiry,&quot; gives an added importanceto this political item  of the miners&apos;  industrial programme.  Nationalisation of railwaysfigures prominently in the demands being pressed by the N.U.R., and the Railway ClerksAssociation has put forward a draft Bill for nationalising both the railway and canalservice.  Many protests have been made  against the handing over to private enterpriseof the engineering, aircraft and shipbuilding establishments taken over or constructed by   (0 1687)  140  a/19  h &amp; s
 the  Government during the war, and as a result of the war the nationalisation of  all armament firms is attracting increased attention at the present time.   In addition, the whole radical labour and socialist press is urging the need of a policy of extensive nationalisa- tion  of important  industrial services.*     At the  same time it is somewhat difficult to estimate the degree  of  importance to attach  to such a demand.  In the  present disturbed state of affairs  it is probably of importance as a plausible pretext for agitation, and in any case the inclusion of political projects of this character in industrial programmes and a threat to compel them by the strike constitute a serious innovation.   The strike becomes a strike directed not against employers, but definitely against the Government, a colour which miners&apos; and railway- men^ strikes were taking on even before the war.   The authority of the general  election just held, and of the Government put in office by it, could not but be affected if  a strike were successful on such a purely political issue.     But, so far as the forces at Work can be disentangled amid the confusion of issues, industrial and political, it  would appear  that such an issue cannot, at any rate at the present stage of development, and in fact  does not by itself, make the same appeal to the individual workman as does a more  concrete demand such as that for higher wages and shorter hours.     The most prominent case of the moment-that of the miners would appear to point to such a conclusion.  In the miners&apos; ballot the districts in which the miners have shown the  greatest political activity in the past do not show the largest majority for  striking now.  Thus, while in South Wales the minority against striking was 1 to 3, in Lancashire and Cheshire it was only 1 to 12, and in Warwickshire and Leicester 1 to 14.   It is probable on this as well  as other grounds,  therefore, that the industrial demand for higher wages and shorter  hours are the primary claims, and nationalisation favoured only as a means to those  ends.  The feeling that the State will be a better employer, easier to secure concessions from,  that nationalisation will elevate the status of the worker and  prevent &quot; profiteering,&quot; are probably also motives in the demand ; but it would appear unlikely that  any  considerable proportion  of the miners base their demand for nationalisation  on a considered social philosophy.    : From a general point of view the industries with  regard  to which this issue has  been raised fall into two categories, according as they possess or do not possess certain charac- teristics which past experience seems to suggest to be necessary for efficient nationalisation at any rate as at present understood.   Thus it may be pointed out that the nationalisation of the mines, engineering or the shipbuilding industry, would be an innovation, while the nationalisation of the railways or electricity supply, would not to the same degree.  The chief examples  of the State ownership  and operation of  industrial services in the  past have been the  Post Office, Telegraphs and  municipalised industries,  particularly gas, water, tramways and electricity supply.  All these services  have certain characteristics which mark them off from other industries.  Thus considerations of technical efficiency require that  they should be operated  each  as a single system under unified control.  They are industries which render their services exclusively to  the people living in the areas which the organisation covers, and in these ,areas they serve most of the people, so that no questions of export to  another country or competition with other countries arise. They are  industries in which the element of risk is slight, methods are standardised, and administration is capable of assimilation to the administration of a department, responsible through a Minister to Parliament  or through a Chairman of Committee to a City Council.     Mining,  engineering or shipbuilding have not these characteristics.   Mining is not a monopoly, though often spoken of as one, being carried on by hundreds of independent firms.  The  services rendered by those industries are not confined to the subjects of the British State;  there is in  each case an export industry,  subject to foreign competition and involving the industry in intimate relations with other countries.   Nor are the  risks to capital slight.  Especially in mining both in the sinking of new pits and experimenting with new methods, risks are great and the opportunities  for individual enterprise corre- spondingiy great.  These are, therefore, industries which, if nationalised, in ordinary times might require a variation from the usual administrative machinery of Government  Depart- ments.  This is important in connection with labour because, as a result, efficiency might be found  to require that administrators connected with these activities should be  allowed a discretion similar to that enjoyed by the managers of National Factories during the war, and this,  while accepted by labour during that period, might easily be  resented, in peace.    * It may  be uoied that this review of the various demands for nationalisation only includes those emanating from a labour or socialist quarter.  Thus in addition, of course, the question of the drink trade has received much consideration, but not especially  or exclusively at the hands of labour.
Railways and electricity supply, on the other hand, have all the characteristics that have:led to public ownership and operation in the past.    The general question of nationalisation is, of course, outside the scope of.the Ministryof Labour, inasmuch as it affects a number of State Departments.  It may  be pointedout, however, speaking purely from the labour point of view, and with a view to industrialpeace which is peculiarly the Ministry of Labour&apos;s concern, that the question of nationalisingthe railways or the proposed electricity super-power stations as well, indeed,  as  theDrink Trade have.been the  subject of detailed investigation before or during the war,and a pronouncement  on  the general  policy of nationalising some  of these industries would, therefore, presumably be practicable; and if it included the intention of nationalisingany of these  or of  other industries of a similar type, or to which similar conditions apply,it would seem probable that it would have  a sedative effect upon  the temper of labour,as showing that the Government hesitation to accede to the demands of miners, employees of National Factories and  shipyards  and others was due not to prejudice, but to a desireto frame a considered and consistent policy.                   PART II.-DEMOBILISATION .AND RESETTLEMENT. Demobilisation.     The number of men demobilised weekly from the three Forces, after showing a rapid rise throughout January,  has now for some weeks past  been declining.  In the week ending the 16th January, 150,000 officers and men were released.  The high-water mark was reached in the week ending the 30th January, when nearly 254,000 officers and men were demobilised.  A decline then took place in the week ending the  6th  February to about 250,000, in the week ending the 13th February to 249,000, and in the  week ending the 20th February to 205,000.     Fifty per cent, of the men returning from the front at the present time are on furlough and are not releasable.  They are Regular soldiers serving under pre-war conditions of service, with two or more years unexpired colour service, or soldiers  re-enlisted in the post-war Army on  conditions entitling them to furlough.  The remaining 50 per cent. are drawn from the classes releasable under the instructions recently  issued as to the composition of the Armies  of Occupation, by which the field for demobilisation has been narrowed considerably.  The effect of these instructions has been to draw a  distinct line of demarcation between men who must continue to serve in the Armies of  Occupation, and those with regard to whom the process of demobilisation is to continue.  Broadly speaking, the retention of  men in the  Armies of Occupation is governed by the date of enlistments     With regard to the others (forming the second half of the men returning at present from the front), demobilisation  continues  in  the main  according  to  industrial needs. Certain modifications have  been  introduced in the system  of  selection, the  principal of which is the abolition of the release of the pivotal men as such. Of the men now being released, 10 per cent, are selected according to length of service in an expeditionary force or command overseas,  and the remainder are made up of men belonging to the following.classes, which are mentioned in order of priority :     (1) Coal miners and agriculturists, who may be released up to 20 per cent,  of the whole          draft. The  release of coal miners is now almost complete, but preference  over          agriculturists is  still given to miners where they are available.    (2) Demobilisers, pivotal men  and men ordered for special release, certified before          the 1st February.    (3) &quot; Contract &quot; men and  &quot; slip &quot; men, i.e., men with certified offers of employment.    (4) Officers and men returning to homes or businesses overseas.    (5) Men of 41 years of  age or over.    (6) Officers and men from hospitals, command depots and convalescent  camps after          28 days in hospital.    *  Men enlisted after the 1st January, 1916, with certain exceptions, are retained.  The most importantexceptions are men who have attained the age of 37, or who have three or more wound  stripes, or who werecertified before the 1st February as demobilisers, pivotal men, or entitled to release on special grounds.    (C 1687)                                                                A 2
                           PART III-PRESS COMMENTS.                         (1)  The Labour and Socialist Press.                                (A)  Peace  Conference.League  of Nations.  &apos;    The draft&apos;scheme for the League  of Nations is widely discussed.  The Labour papersare either suspicious of or  openly hostile to the  scheme.  The &quot;Labour  Leader,&quot;  the&quot; Herald &quot; and the &quot; Call,&quot; condemn it as a flagrant device to constitute five great Powersdictators of  the  Universe.  According  to the  &quot; Call&quot; and &quot; Forward &quot; it perpetuatesthe system of alliances, with the victorious Allies on one side, &quot; determined to secure worlddomination by division of the gains among themselves.&quot;    The exclusion of Germany, Kussia and the Neutrals is taken as a bad omen.  Theresult of excluding these countries, says the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; will be the formation ofa  rival league.   The &quot; Herald&quot;  attributes  their  exclusion to the fact that they  arerevolutionary countries and only oligarchies are  presumably to  be admitted.   In  theopinion of the &quot; Herald &quot; the scheme appears to be founded on the  principle of  the domination  of the weak nations  by  the strong;  and the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; continues,&quot; the small Allied Nations cannot be expected to tolerate their inferior position for long.&quot;It is prophesied that, when the League of Germany,  Kussia and  the Neutrals becomesstrong, the natural tendency of the smaller nations will be to &quot; play the policy of the Balance    ^7) Men who, although they are neither &quot;contract &quot; men nor &quot; slip &quot; men, belong to           industrial  groups now open for demobilisation.  Excluding agriculture and           coal mining, these groups are all of equal priority.  The list at present includes           seamen  and fishermen (who, however,  are being discharged only from  the           Army, as their services in the Navy are still required); workers in slate mines           or quarries ; workers in other quarries (excluding iron); workers in the paper,           printing and bookbinding industries;  men engaged in  the  clothing trade,           tailors and other workers in dress;  coopers, coachbuilders,  wheelwrights and           other, wood-workers;  workers in the shipbuilding industry; iron and steel           workers;  tinplate  manufacturers;   men engaged  in the  china, glass and           pottery  trades;  workers in the manufacture of brick and cement;  men in           building and constructional  trades ;  railway  workers ; carters and carmen ;           employees  of public and local authorities; professional men; students and           teachers.     An analysis of about  1,044,000 cases  of demobilisation from the  three Forces (ex-cluding men discharged on medical grounds)  shows  a very considerable preponderance of coal and shale miners above men in other industries.  Nearly 195,000 are coal miners.The industrial groups which come next are those covering commercial and clerical occupa-tions which account for 120,000 men, and the engineering and metal trades which comprise110,000.  Agriculture, the  brick and building trades, and railways and transport, whichrank next, show only  half the number of men released for coal mining.     Although no claims for pivotal men  have been granted since the 1st  February, avery  large number of those claimed and passed by the &quot;Department as pivotal before thatdate have still to be released.   Some indication of the extent of the work still to be donein this direction is given by a provisional estimate (which must, however,  be acceptedwith  caution), that only about a third  of the pivotal men  claimed from the Army andAir Force before the  1st February have  as yet been released.  The process is furtheradvanced as regards pivotal men in the Navy, from which it is estimated that three-fifths of the pivotal hien claimed have been demobilised.Resettlement.     Unemployment. On Friday, the 14th February, the latest date  for which  completeinformation is available, the number of out-of-work donation policies remaining lodgedat the employment exchanges exceeded the previous week&apos;s total by over 94,000 an increaseof 12^ per cent, in the week, and the largest weekly rise since the scheme was inaugurated.The policies lodged by men of H.M. Forces rose by nearly a third of  the previous week&apos;total.  The proportion of men to women unemployed continued to increase.    On the 7th March, it is estimated, about 30,000 civilian workers  will have exhaustedthe 78 days unemployment for which their policies are available.
 of Power.&quot;  The  &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; considers the Paris draft a flat contradiction  of the principles on  which alone  a league can be founded.   For example, the  principle  of the &quot;open door&quot;  is not to be universally applied, and again, the mandatory principle applies only to colonies which were formerly governed by States excluded from the League, while the colonies of Great Britain, Belgium,  &amp;c, are exempted.  The &quot; Workers&apos; Dread- nought &quot; terms it &quot; a  Capitalist League,&quot; and is certain that the Mandatory  Powers will endeavour  to prevent the  natural development of the people towards  Socialism, the coming civilisation.     &quot; Justice &quot; dares  not be too sanguine, since President Wilson&apos;s exhortation to the American  Senate  and Congress to  support the Navy Bill scarcely gives  the impression that lie thinks the  day of peace has come for the United States.  The &quot; British Citizen &quot; thinks the Paris draft is an admirable document on paper, but the really interesting thing will be to see whether it will work. Paris  Labour Commission.     The &quot; Labour Leader &quot;  voices the same criticism as appeared last week in the &quot; Call,&quot; that the Paris Labour Commission will be an organisation for the suppression of Socialism. It considers that it will be fatal to entrust an International Labour Bureau to an autocratic set of officials. Indemnities.     The &quot; Herald &quot; contains an article  arguing  against the  imposition of indemnities. The main reason is that an  indemnity will fall on the German working class, and if it  is paid in goods it will also  mean unemployment in this country.  Mr. Ramsay Macdonald in &quot; Forward &quot; relates that when discussing the subject of international labour legislation with the German delegates  in Berne,  these latter explained that if large indemnities are placed on Germany they  could not expect high standards of  labour conditions, as they would be forced  to sweat  their workers sweating and  burdensome indemnities could not bexseparated. Berne Conference.     &quot; Justice,&quot; maintaining its attitude of hostility, says that fortunately  the Conference represents little but the opinions of those who were  present.  It still maintains that they should have continued the  discussion on  the responsibility for the war.  Mr. Ramsay Macdonald in &quot; Forward &quot; describes the  preliminary conversations he had with German delegates.  When  he  tried to explain the British feeling about atrocities the Germans replied that the greatest atrocity of the war was the  starvation of their women and children.  The &quot; Herald &quot; contents itself with publishing an account of the proceedings.                                (B)  Foreign Affairs. Russia.     Several papers express  disappointment at the failure of the Prinkipo scheme.  The &quot; Call&quot; asks indignantly why the Prinkipo Conference has not met.  The paper records with shame the fact that the Labour Party in Parliament has so far raised no protest in the matter.  The  &quot; Herald &quot; warns Labour to stand out  against the renewed clamour for intervention in Russia and  to insist on an honest adherence to the Prinkipo policy. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; suggests that military intervention in Russia was abandoned, not because it was &quot; wrong,&quot; but because it was &quot; impracticable.&quot;  The British Government still gives support in materials to any reactionary group which is fighting the  Bolsheviks. The &quot; Herald &quot; publishes a letter, signed by M. Litvinoff and M. V. Vorovsky to Dr. Ludwig Meyer of Christiania,  containing a semi-official statement of the Soviet attitude towards peace.   The Soviet Government declines to state the terms on which it would be prepared to make peace with the Allies.  It declares that the objects of the Allies in invading Russia have never been made known to the Government directly or indirectly.  All that it demands is evacuation of Russian territory, and it is urged that this course would lead to a cessation of civil war, and would allow the Republic-what it has hitherto lacked namely, a fair chance to put into  practice its principles and show what it can do for the Russian people.                                 (C) Home  Affairs. New Parliament.    The general opinion of the  I.L.P.  papers is that there &quot; has never been a  parliament in which profiteering was so strongly represented, a fact which will give direction to thelegislation of the Government if Labour permits.&quot;     (C 1687)                                                               A 3
     Air, Neil MacLean, M.P., describes his first impressions of Parliament in &quot; Forward.&quot;He is especially impressed by the strength of Landlordism and Capitalism.  He thinks thePrime Ministers speech was virtually a  declaration of war upon Trade Unions.  As an example, voicing a similar opinion, the &quot;  Call &quot; points out that even the mild amendmentof the Labour Party to the King&apos;s Speech  met with flint-like resistance and evoked a state-ment which only meant a policy of do-nothing.  It adds, however, that events are movingfaster outside the House of Commons than within it.  The &quot; Herald &quot; alludes  to theundeniable fact that the Government or employers have conceded terms after a stoppageorganised by the rank and file which were refused to the official Trade Union leadersduring negotiations.  The &quot; Herald &quot; asks how the leaders of Labour can be expected tokeep the confidence of the rank and file when such a state of affairs exists.  It congratulatesthe Labour Party on their conduct during the first phase of the struggle against vested interests.  In the speeches  of Adamson, Thomas, Brace and Clynes, realities were at lastapproached.National Democratic Party.     The &quot; Herald &quot; and the &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; remark on.the fact that the membersof the National Democratic Party opposed the Labour Party&apos;s amendment to the King&apos;sSpeech,  thus they  voted against the suggestion that definite  proposals for improvingindustrial conditions should be made.  The &quot; British Citizen,&quot;  the official  organ of theabove party, thinks the new Parliament promises to  be extraordinarily interesting.  Itspeaks of Mr. Adamson&apos;s speech  as a rather laboured effort.Industrial  Unrest and the Governments Labour  Conference.     The principal ground on which the  proposed  Conference is criticised relates to itsunrepresentative character.  If the conference is confined to representatives of industrial councils and Reconstruction Committees,  says the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; large bodies of labour will be left outside and one cannot see what useful purpose such a conference can serve.The Shop  Stewards organisation is held responsible for the present ferment, and that being so both the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; and the &quot;Herald &quot; agree that, if the Governmentis really anxious to ascertain the views of  the workers, the Conference should contain menand women &quot;straight from the industries in which they are employed,  and should not be confined to the so-called leaders who reflect only second or third-hand views.    Justice &quot;thinks it will be  too large and unwieldy  to  discuss the immediate matters in dispute.     The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; suggests that the intention of the Government in  callingsuch a conference is probably  to  create popular resentment against the strikes, and the&quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot;  asks  &quot; has not a Government inquiry become  the  classicalmethod of leaving things as they are ? &quot;  The &quot; British Citizen &quot; is the only paper whichthinks that the Government is taking the right course in setting up an inquiry into thegeneral labour position.    The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; remarks that all Capitalist Governments seem to have a passionfor  enquiry into the obvious;  the paper  asserts that  everyone  knows the causes of thepresent unrest.   &quot; Forward,&quot;  the   &quot; Labour  Leader &quot; and  the &quot; Herald &quot;  emphasise the fact that the issues do not lie in the adjustment between wages and prices but relateto the pre-war demand for better conditions for which workers have been waiting five years.Democracy thought it had qualified for a new world, and now finds that in too many cases it cannot even get its  old place back again.Miners&apos; Demands.    The &quot;Herald.&quot; refers to the.unfair  dealing of the Government in publishing only two-thirds  of the facts relating to the miners&apos;  demands in the advertisement columns ofthe newspapers.   The  &quot; Call &quot; goes  further and considers the  Governments offer of aIs. a day and a Committee of Enquiry as  an insult, when the miners were only asking the&quot; Coupon Cabinet &quot; to  honour some of their promises.   In commenting on the four items in the miners&apos; programme it is pointed out by the &quot; Herald &quot; that the industry has bornethe great and unnecessary costs of feeding excess profits during the war and implies thatit is therefore able to bear the higher wages  demanded by the men.   The miners also proposenationalisation as a means  of meeting any additional  cost entailed by their other threedemands.  The &quot; British Citizen &quot; and &quot; Justice &quot; consider Sir Robert Horne&apos;s protest against the form  of the ballot paper to be justified.  The wording in the ballot  paper is correct, but the implication in the wording is not, and it is the implication which is meant to influence, and  will influence, the vote.
 Clyde Strike.     The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; contains a list of the achievements of the Clyde strike which the Capitalist Press implied to have been entirely unsuccessful.   The two intangible results are said to be (1) that the demand for a  40-hour week is keener than ever, and (2) that sectionalism  has been swamped by the strike, which was characteristic  for its unity of action and aim. Shorter hours were secured for three bodies of  Scottish labour.  The Scottish Municipal Employees and Carters were both granted a 48-hour week during the. strike, and the Scottish Building Trade Employers, more  or less influenced by the strike, offered their men a 44-hour week.                (2) The Daily Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.     There continues  to be scarcely any  critical statements in  the daily press regarding demobilisation. Employment Outlook.     The &quot; Nottingham Guardian &quot; (20th  February)  reports that at a  meeting of the Nottinghamshire District Wages Committee on 19th February, &quot; it was decided to draw the attention of the authorities to the serious position of the farmers due  to the delays in the demobilisation of agricultural workers.  Not only is the work of cultivation held up, but it is still necessary to employ German prisoners.&quot;     The &quot; Times  Engineering  Supplement&quot;  (February)  states that the  Boilermakers&apos; February Report shows 2,000 unemployed members compared to 886  a month earlier.     &quot; A Disabled Soldier,&quot; writing in the &quot; Yorkshire Post &quot; (20th February), complains that while demobilised  men cannot find  posts, there are a number of good positions  on local War Pensions Committees staffs which are at present being held by women.     Viscountess Rhondda  writes in the  &quot; Yorkshire  Observer &quot;  (18th  February) that &quot;in whole areas such as the  North-East Coast there is practically  no employment for &apos;industrial women.&apos;&quot;  She asks what is  the  Government doing for  finding employment for these efficient women workers in peace time occupations ?                PART IV. GENERAL TOPICS AND DISTRICT REPORTS.                                   (A)  General.Workers&apos; Demands.    In the recent ballot regarding a general strike in the coal trade 611,998 miners voted for striking and 104,997 against, so that the  majority in favour of a strike was 507,001.In South Wales the voting was for a strike 117,302, against 38,261.  A Bill has been passedsetting up a Statutory Commission to enquire into the demands contained in the Miners&apos;National Programme.  The Commission is to make  an  interim Report on the questionof Wages and Hours by the 20th March.    It is reported that the National Conference of the Engineers and Allied Trades JointCommittee at Leeds on 22nd February decided to demand a 40-hour week for all workersin the engineering and shipbuilding trades.  This decision was reached in spite of the factthat the majority of districts had shown themselves to  be in favour of a  44-hour week.A resolution was also passed at the meeting &quot; that each district calls for a local conference with a demand  for a 40-hour week; that, failing satisfaction, we refer the question tothe central conference on  a given date ; and  if the central conference fails, we ask for anational ballot to be taken on the &apos; down tools &apos; policy.&quot;  A National Conference between representatives of the Municipal Tramways Association, the Tramways and Light RailwaysAssociations and the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation is to be held at Birminghamon  Friday, 28th February, to  consider the deadlock in the negotiations on the hoursquestion caused by the men&apos;s claim that wages should remain unaltered with the reductionof hours to 48.    The Master Bakers in London  are still opposed to any legislation to abolish nightwork in the bakery trade  unless night work is abolished in all trades.  It is stated thatthe Operative Bakers&apos; Union will only resort  to a strike if all other means fail to securethe abolition of night work.    An agitation is reported to have begun among the London Postal Workers for a revisionof working hours.    The proposed reforms include the establishment of a seven-hour day and the restriction of all night work to a minimum ; also the establishment of a Whitley Council for the PostalService.
