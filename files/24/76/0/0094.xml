MINISTRY   OF   FOOD.ort  for  Week  ending Wednesday,  March  12, 1919.                        PART  J..---ACTION  TAKEN.    The Food Controller and Sir William Beveridge are at present in Paris  in  con-nexion with the work of the Supreme Economic  Council.  The Food Controller hasmade the following statement on the subject of the  supply  and distribution of food tothe populations of various European countries :     The British people are asked to take a broad view and realise that in addition tothe humanitarian reasons for feeding Germany, it  was politically expedient to enableGermany to recover herself so that she might be capable of meeting the just claims ofthe Allies for reparation and indemnity.   The sooner peace could be made the soonerthe food problem of the world could be tackled.  Both  enemy and  neutral countriesfind that, so long as the blockade  exists, the possibility of securing food supplies isdenied them,  and they have to live very much on themselves..    The question of raising the blockade, or even of admitting imports under licence,was not one which  he was competent to decide,  but certain facts arising from theblockade question were significant.    There was reason to believe that some European countries had large accumulatedstocks of Government-owned food.  Those Governments were unable to see the futureclearly, and. so long as the blockade existed they would endeavour to keep those stocksintact.  It  was also known that there  had been  much hoarding  by the well-to-doclasses, both in neutral and  enemy  countries.  In fact, even  in Germany  the richpossessed  considerable quantities of hoarded food,  and it was felt that when  theblockade was raised and trade conditions rendered more normal it  would be foundthat those Government and private stocks would be released and the position relievedto that extent.    The problem  of giving food assistance to the  starving  peoples of the worldembraced  the consideration of  problems of finance, transport, and  politics of thegreatest magnitude.    Machinery had  been created  in  Paris  with  the object  of organising the distribution  of  supplies.  That machinery is  under  control of theSupreme Economic Council.   Although some reports were contradictory perhapsmainly owing to faulty distribution of food there was no doubt that  extensive reliefmeasures would have to be adopted.  The  internal transport  system in Germany andother European countries had broken  down, either owing to anarchy and unwillingnessto work 01- to general debility due to shortage of food.  Thus the Supreme economic council would not only have to acquire  food,  and devise some means by which germany  could pay for it, but it would have to create a  transport and  distributionsystem, build railways, and run steamships.  There  was plenty of food in existence and, provided always that the tonnage was  available in adequate  bulk, supplies wouldbe forthcoming.  Towards the middle of next  month  a  fleet of American  ships, ofabout 3,000 tons each, at present blocked in the  Great Lakes by ice, would become available for  food traffic.     In order to reassure the British people, many of whom apprehend that if food isdiverted to Central Europe a shortage will be experienced at home, it should be statedthat there  seem no grounds for any such apprehension.  Of  course, the first concernis sufficiency and lowered prices for our own people, and next to meet  the demands ofour Allies.  And we feel that these requirements can be fulfilled, and that at the sametime we will  be able to furnish food for  the famished people of Europe.     Potato Situation. The following is a summary of a separate memorandum whichhas been laid before the Cabinet:            At  the beginning of 1918  an announcement  was made that  the Food       Controller would purchase the entire crop  with  certain minor exceptions.  In       July 1918 a Potatoes (Growers&apos; Prices) Commission was appointed  in  order to       fix the prices of the crop, and  this Commission fixed such prices for the sound       ware and sound undersized potatoes  as would  give the growers  a reasonable       profit not only upon the sound potatoes but upon the total cost of production       of  the entire crop.   Since in normal practice the farmer does not dispose of     A (33)7576-2 Pk!)  150 11/1!) K&amp;S                                          A
      his potato crop at the time when it  is taken from the ground, but clamps  and     &apos; disposes of the.clamped potatoes at intervals extending from November to the      following June and since  the wastage due to disease and other causes is spread      over  the period  of  delivery, the  Commission provided for a rising scale of      prices upon  the potatoes which  would  become  deliverable from  month to      month, so that as wastage accrued the prices automatically increased.           Apart from  the  claim that the Ministry should pay a separate price for      blighted potatoes in addition to such sum as is included in respect  of loss by      blight in the price fixed by the Commission for sound  ware potatoes, it is also       claimed that in some cases loss of potatoes has been occasioned  by neglect or      delay on the  part  of the  Ministry in  taking  delivery.   The Ministry are      prepared to accept responsibility in any case in which such default on their      part can be shown to be the effective cause of loss, but as regards the claim of      certain growers for special compensation in respect of  their- blighted potatoes      Avhere there has  been no default  on the part of the Ministry, the Department      cannot recognise any responsibility in the matter.           At the same time the Ministry recognise that the temporary and uneven      development of blight may cause  very serious hardship to some  individuals      who  have grown potatoes this year at the request of the Government.   AVhere,      for instance, the whole or a large part  of a farmer&apos;s crop has been affected, he      will  naturally not  be materially  assisted by  the increase in the price of-   .   sound ware potatoes.   The  Ministry  of Food &apos;are prepared accordingly, not      &apos; as a  matter of legal  right but with a view to preventing serious hardship, to      consider favourably  any application from a farmer  who  can prove that he      increased his acreage  under potatoes  this year and  that  taking his crop as      a whole, he has, without fault  of  his own, incurred an actual loss.  In such      cases the Ministry propose, subject to the consent of  the  Treasury, to makef     , good  the loss.  ,   Finance. The following figures  show in outline  the   financial  result of theoperations of the Ministry during the.year  ended March 31st, 1918.  There is a surpluson  the  trading account, after  debiting all  expenses of administration  includingrationing, rent, rates, taxes, stationery, expenses  of Buying Commission in America,commission  to  financial agents  in America, &amp;c,  of 133,363/.   This surplus has beencarried  forward as a reserve against losses in liquidation of stocks.  The total sales ofthe Ministry to 31st March 1918  amounted to 45,561,6111, and the stocks held at  thatdate stood in the books  at  20,974,1161.   The administrative expenses amounted to1,249,375/. or  approximately 2 per cent, on the total transactions including the  stockspurchased.     These figures exclude the operations of  the  Wheat Commission and  the sugar commission, but include a  debit of 549,8831. for rationing expenses, a proportion ofwhich was incurred in connexion with the rationing of sugar.     As regards the accounts to 31st March 1919, it is anticipated that the  percentageof expenses will be lower than in the preceding period owing to the largely increasedturnover without a corresponding increase in the overhead  expenses.     It  must also be  borne in mind that these expenses include  the cost  of control--iing the distribution and fixing the prices of many commodities which are not actuallybought  and  sold by the Government.   .  It  is difficult  at present to  give any estimate of  the trading results to  the end ofMarch 1919 because  of the  uncertainty of the prices  which  will be realised on the stocks held  by&apos; the Ministry at that date, but it is anticipated that  it will be necessaryfor losses to be provided for out  of  Treasury funds, in order to enable the Ministry ofFood to follow the falling prices of food-stuffs  in  liquidating the stocks they hold. Itis estimated that the Ministry will, hold  about  60  million pounds worth  of stocks,the price being taken as the value at the 31st March next.     Food Gouncil:--Meetmgs of the Council were held on. March 6th and 11th.     It  was decided  that  maximum  summer  prices  for milk,  with effect  up to september 30th, should be fixed by the Ministry.     On the question of the control of cheese,  it wras decided that control  should berelinquished as from a suitable  date in the early summer ; but that a maximum price for home-produced cheese should be reintroduced if there were evidence of excessiveprices.&apos;                               &apos;     ;&apos;  1     It was also agreed that the individual rationing of butter should be brought to anend either on May let Or June 1st, although Some System ^yistribution to the retailers
should :be maintained.   Unless the individual rationing of butter is brought to &quot;an end in June&apos;of this year it will be necessary for it  to be  continued until June  1920,  inwhich case the full system of  registration&apos; of- customers, involving a large  part;  of thepresent food office expenditure, will be required for at least another fifteen months.  1 &apos; As regards cocoa, it was  decided   ; ;       (1) that the Cocoa Butter (Provisional Prices) Order, 1918, arid the Cocoa  Butter             (Requisition) Order, 1918, should  be suspended.       (2) that prohibition on the import of cocoa butter should be removed.       (3) that the general control of raw  cocoa, cocoa powder, cocoa bean shell, &amp;c,             should be  maintained for the time being.    It was decided that the Sugar  (Confectionery)  Order, 1917, which lays downmaximum prices  for  chocolates and other sweetmeats,  should  be revoked as from june  1st.    Inter-Departmental  Committee on the Reduction of Food Prices. -The Committeemet on March 12th.    The proposal that the price of imported  meat should be reduced by 2d. per lb.oh May 1st and a further 2d. per lb.  on July 1st, was generally approved by theCommittee; the,representatives of H.M. Treasury required however further evidencethat the estimated loss incurred in these reductions is definitely due to charges arisingout of war conditions,  which is being supplied.    Imports Board. It was  reported  that, owing to  labour troubles in the UnitedKingdom, six ships  have  been delayed  to the  extent  of  two months, and that as  aresult the arrivals of Australasian meat and dairy produce  will be reduced by 21,000tons.  &apos; ? )         -             -                                       r         v i\    It was also reported that  H.M. Treasury has been  asked&apos;to sanction the purchaseof 300,000 tons of feeding stuffs, and that so far sanction has been obtained for thepurchase of 50,000 tons from India and Burma, 50,000 tons  from Egypt, 8,000 tons from Canada, and 3,000 tons from Peru.   ,  -  Consumers&apos; Council. The Council metion March 12th.                 - &apos;&apos;    The Council passed a resolution in favour of the repeal  of the Order under whichbread may not be sold until 12 hours after it has been baked.    It was agreed that the control of wholesale  dealers in milk should cease as from march 31st or April 30th; and that the control of cheese should be relinquished  atan early date. .                                . :: :    On the general question of  control the  Council expressed the view  that  theMinistry of Food should be maintained  as  a permanent department with  some  of thepowers at present vested in it, and with certain  additional powers in relation to foodnow held by other Government Departments.                           SUPPLIES AND DISTRIBUTION.  &quot;&quot;&apos;    Meat.-The supplies of live stock have shown an appreciable, increase during thepast week, chiefly owing to the rise in price to the producer  which came into force  at-the beginning of the month.    Distribution  has  proceeded  satisfactorily  on.a  basis  of  supply to the butcherwhich has been higher than any reached since  the inception of rationing.  For eachregistered customer a  butcher is now entitled to buy the following weekly quantities          Beef, veal, mutton and lamb    -      -      -     .  -   24   ozs.         Pork    -       -      ...      - &apos;     -       -   2&apos;4 ozs.        .&apos;-         Edible offal     ------   4&apos;8 ozs.      ... &quot;         Beef for sausage-making       -      -               -   2&apos;4ozs.Total    -   33&quot; 4 ozs.    Milk-The second Inter-Departmental Conference  on the future of milk control was held on March  5th.  The evidence submitted pointed  to the fact that mrhVproducers in England are not averse from the proposed scheme of Government control,and it was agreed that the matter should be discussed in  detail with the English  and scottish producers.                             -            .            1   *  ,    Potatoes-Arrangements  have  been made for the  export of  100,000  tons  of potatoes.to the occupied territories of-Germany on the  left bank  of, the Rhine.;  Allpossible steps.are being taken  to. arrange for immediate shipments.   ,
     Butter--Arrangements have .been  made  for  the purchase of  the  exportable surplus of butter in the Argentine from March to December.   This is estimated  at approximately 11,000 tons, at a cost of 160s. per cwt. f.o.b. first grade.     Dried Fruits. 8,000 tons of currants and a large quantity of dates have arrived during the week, and will be distributed as soon  as they can be unloaded.  Further quantities of American  dried  fruits have arrived, but it is not proposed to put these into  distribution until I  the  whole of  the  American purchases have  reached this country.     Ration Books. It has been arranged that persons claiming unemployment benefit shall be required to produce their ration books  and those of their children in respect of whom claims are made.  This  procedure provides  a check against impersonation and excessive claims.                ORDERS UNDER DEFENCE OF THE REALM REGULATIONS.     An Order dated 4th March 1919 revoking the Dealings in Oats (Restriction) Order, 1917, allows British traders to deal in.  oats outside the United Kingdom.     A notice  dated 6th March 1919, revokes the Ice Cream (Restriction) Order, 1917, and-the Milk (Restriction in Establishments) Order, 1918.  The former prohibited the manufacture and sale of ice cream, which will  now be permitted on and from March 22nd, although  cream may  not; be used for the purpose ; the  latter prohibited the serving of milk as  a beverage, and limited the quantity of milk for use&apos;in catering establishments.  Caterers need no longer keep records of their consumption of milk.     An Order amending the Poultry and Game (Prices) Order, 1918, dated 7th March 1919.  Hitherto live  poultry intended for  breeding, laying or rearing purposes have been exempt from the provisions of  this Order as  to prices.  A  similar  exemption  is now extended to pheasants and wild fowl.     An Order dated 10th March 1919 revokes the/Edible Oils and Fats and Oil and Fat Compounds (Distribution) Order, 1918.   This abolishes control of distribution of these commodities, which may now be purchased under normal trade conditions.     An Order amending the Potatoes (Scotland) Order, 1918, dated  10th March 1919, increases the growers&apos; maximum prices for ware potatoes in Scotland.   This increase corresponds with the increase granted to growers in England and Wales.     A general  licence, dated 11th March 1919,.under the  Egg  (Prices) Order, 1918, and the Eggs (Licensing  of Wholesale Dealers and Distribution) Order, 19] 8, frees eggsfrom restrictions as to prices on and from March 17th, and permits dealings in eggswithout a wholesale dealer&apos;s licence.                             ENFORCEMENT OF ORDERS.    The total number of prosecutions   during the week ended March 1st was 582, ofwhich  497 resulted  in  convictions.  Prosecutions were  reported under 57 different Orders.    At Leigh, a Friendly Co-operative  Society  was fined 100L  and  5i. 5s. cost forbuying cattle for slaughter otherwise than in a market.             PART  II.-SUMMARY OF  THE  FOOD  POSITION.    -                                    IMPORTS.    The total imports of the  principal  foods  and feeding-stuffs  in  the week ended8th March (119,100 tons) were slightly higher  than  those  in the previous week(118,200 tons), but were again below the average of the first 10 weeks of the calendar year  (157,200 tons) or of the first 27  weeks  of the  cereal  year  (172,200 tons).Compared with the preceding week there were increased imports of oats (3,100 tons)and rice (11,900 tons) sugar (21,800 tons) and  cocoa (4,500 tons) but a falling oft&apos; inmeat (10,800 tons) by 42 per cent., bacon (6,400 tons) by 58 per cent., lard (1,700 tons)by 42 per cent., and tea (2,100 tons) by 64 per cent., while only  very small imports of butter (300 tons) and cheese (400 tons) were entered and no barley.  Wheat, imports(30,000  tons) were again very low,  and followed on a month in which the imports were less than one-half the lowest figure recorded for any February since the outbreakof war.
    Fruit and vegetables arrived in substantial  quantities, especially oranges (12,200tons) apples (6,800 tons), bananas (2,000 tons), and onions (8,300 tons).    The figures for the first  27 weeks of  the cereal year  1917-18 and 1918-19 arecompared in the following table.Total Imports for the first 27 weeks of Cereal Year (1st September to 8th, March).	1918-19.

The estimated consumption of butchers&apos; meat in Great britain in the  last week of February showed  that about 13 per cent, of the ration  quantitywas not taken up, the proportion for the month being about 8 per cent.  The decreaseof consumption in the fourth week was  due to a variety  of causes affecting demand and supply ;  the anticipation of higher prices for live  stock on  1st March led to theusual scarcity of live stock in the market, while the prospective fall in retailers&apos; pricescontracted demand both on the part of consumers and that of butchers who wished toavoid carrying over any stock into the  following week.    Flour. In. Table 0(2) the index number illustrating  variations in the quantity of flour delivered from mills or released from imported supplies is continued for the four weeks  ended March 1st.   While the increase on the rate a year  before (24 per cent.)does reflect some increase of consumption due to the improved quality of the loaf andthe relaxation of economy, a great part  of this increase is accounted for by the enlarge-ment of looal trade stocks of flour.    Other Foods. -Table  B  (1) continues the  estimated  weekly quantities of  foodpassing into traders&apos; hands for distribution,  The approaching relaxation of control is reflected in the reduction of the quantities of bacon allocated for civilian consumptionas traders are anxious to reduce their  stocks.  The  prospective reduction of priceof margarine  had a similar effect  upon the quantity distributed in the last week  ofFebruary.  The quantities shown for  sugar  cannot  be taken as reflecting a corre-sponding increase of  actual consumption, since issues of sugar have  been influenced by various causes.   Owing  to a false  impression that  sugar prices would fall earlyin 1919, wholesalers and retailers had  reduced their stocks in January, whereas  it isnow important, in view of the transport situation, that these stocks should be as large as possible.   Owing to the difficulty  experienced by manufacturers  in  securing thereturn  of their workmen from military service, issues  of  sugar  to thjem in Januarywere lower than was anticipated, but in February the quantity issued  was in excess oftheir normal allowance.                                     STOCKS.    The stocks of the principal foods and feeding stuffs on 1st March  are given  inTable  D.   During the month of February there has  been a very general reduction  in stocks, the chief exception being maize and  grain meals (the  stocks of  which werelow), butter,  canned fish, tea, and cocoa.   The  decrease in lard  was  10 per  cent.,  incheese 25 per cent.,  in condensed milk  13 per cent.,  in meat  11 per cent., and  inbacon  6 per cent.  The stocks on 1st March 1919 are compared with the March stocks in preceding years in the following table the maximum figures for each article being-printed in clarendon type.A 7576-2B
