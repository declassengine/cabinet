Circulated by direction of  tho  secretary of Stato for War.SECRET.0167/396.12.5.19.EQUIPMENT AND MATERIAL FOR ROUMANIAN ARMY.NOTE BY THE GENLRAL STAFF. WAR OFFICE.  -     Major-General W,K,  Greenly,  CM, G* ,D. S,0c,  Chief  of  theBritish Military Mission in Roumanian  has rendered a report onthe present military and economic situation in Roumania,  ofwhich the following is a summary(a)   Tho Country and, the Army;,are  on the  verge  of  starvation     both as  regards&quot;food and civ thing: the  chief  cause  cf     starvation in the matter cf food Is  lack of means Cf     distribution, especially locomotives.          This situation provides  a favourable  field for     the Bolshevist germ and propaganda is  very active:     there have been signs of its  meeting with  some  success.(b)   The Army, while living under  very hard  conditions and     lacking almost all necessities of life, is engaged  In     defending a very long frontier in Bessarabia  and Trail-     sylvanIa against active and fairly well equipped enemies,     Bolshevist and others.          At the same time it has  so far  loyally resisted  tho     active Bolshevist propaganda from without  and within  the     country.  Its efforts to defend the  frontiers against     external enemies are greatly handicapped by its lack  of     boots, clothing and. equipments and the  very deficient     means of transportation; the same causes throw  an     immense extra strain cn its loyalty  in resisting internal     Bolshevism^(c)   The first necessity from both the military and  the     general economic point of view is the  provision of  means     of transportation, especially railway  locomotives:  the     distribution of food, fuel and other supplies to both     the army and tho civil population,  and the movement of     troops by rail is now almost impossible,  Out of about     1,000 locomotives now in the country,  nearly 800 are  in     the shops awaiting repairs for.which material is lacking.          The provision of railway repair material can there-     fore be said to be the most important&quot; and &quot;the most     urgent necessity: and General Greenly!s Mission contains     a  section of expert railway officers who will see that     such material as is provided will be utilised to the     bost advantagee(d)   If the Army can continue successfully to  defend the     frontiers and to resist internal Bolshevism it  will avort     revolution.The practical steps proposed to enable it to do so  are  s-     1.  To create a small well-equipped mobile fcrce to act         as a reserve to the more or less immobile  troops         along the frontier,
2,  To clothe and feed the remainder of the army to    such a degree as will put the troops in a state    of comparative comfort and efficiency,  and to    relieve them from the real misery in which they    are at present.(e)   Although Roumania is  in the sphere of  influence  ef     the French they appear to he unable to supply her     necessities^  especially in rogaro!&quot;To railway  repair     material, and it is believed that France would not be     unwilling to see us send the assistance so urgently     requiredc,  This being the case,  it is  unquestionably     in our interests to do so,  because          1.   Unless  epeedy  relief  is given  an  outbreak of              Bolshevism is  regarded as  inevitable  and the loss              of  Roumania would  be  a serious blow  to  the Allied              cause c          2,   Provision of assistance will be a good  investment              from the point of  view of  British trade and              commercial influence  and will  greatly strengthen              our prestige in the  country, and  indeed .in the              Near East generally.          3,   Assistance will enable the great  supply of oil              available (output  at  present 2,000 tons a day, of              which 1,000 tons only are  required in the country)              to  be  made use of  and coal fuel to be saved  thereby.          4.   In  return for  our&quot;assistance it should  not be              difficult to obtain  oil concessions  for the  Admiralty              in  a position  well placed  for  use by our fleets in              Mediterranean  and  East African waters.     (f)   In view of the above,&quot; the following proposals are made:-          1..   That H.M.1 s Government give credit to the Roumanian              Government for the purchase of railway  material up&apos;              to   500,000.          2,   That credit be also  given  for  the purchase of  the              military stores and  animals as shown in Appendix              &quot;A&quot; attached,,          3.   That shipping  be placed  at the disposal of the              British-Military Mission  to take  to Roumania direct              such of the material and  stores as will be supplied              from England.
