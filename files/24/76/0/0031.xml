PEIHOLEUIi EXECUTIVEl:SI.IOHAI!DUI.I 3?03 TH2 GAB HIST(The need for a permanent Petroleum Department)          The Petroleum Executive was called into being in April, 1917, as a war measure.  Up to that time each government Department had managed its own oil affairs,but the conflict oi claims on a supply of tonnage whichwas being seriously reduced by enemy action necessitated the creation of some independent advisory and decidingbody, and in consequence the Petroleum Ix:ecutive was instituted to co-ordinate matters connected with petrol-equalise and to programme the requirements of the variousconsuming departments.          lit its suggestion the Inter-Allied PetroleumConference was inaugurated and the Committee on ImperialPolicy set up.  Various&apos;technical committees have alsomet under its auspices.          It has been constantly referred to by all departments, has collected and distributed statisticaland other information, has been in frequent consulta-tlon with the foreign Office and Colonial Office on all questions (political and otherwise) affecting the pro-duo t ion of oil in foreign countries and British posses-sions, and has maintained close touch with the Admiralty,VTar Office, Air Ilinistry and Ministry of Shipping.  Theworh of the Department has very greatly increased evenduring the last si:: months.          It is submitted that the growing importanceof petroleum ae one of the &quot;hey&quot; industries justifiedthe continuance in peace of a department whose utilitywas demonstrated, during the war.          Our dependence on seaborne and to a largeextent on foreign supplies for our immense requirementsof petroleum mates the whole question one of peculiarimportance vitally affecting our naval and mercantilesupremacy and provides a strong argument for special and separate treatment.  On the other hand should the search for petroleum which is now being made in thiscountry prove successful, the industry would require tobe supervised by such a specialised department as that suggested.          It can confidently be asserted that the petroleum Executive could not have rendered services ofeoual value had it been attached to an existing Depart-ment, and to maize it, if placed on a permanent basis,an adjunct of, say, the Board of Trade or the Ilinistry
123of Supply would, it is thought, not be satisfactory toother Departments, which would ieel that their inter-ests could not be impartially or adequately served. Thenecessity for adjustment of the requirements of consume-ing Departments will, it is true, loom less large as thequestion of supply of petroleum becomes less difficult,but there will oe other matters in which Departmentalinterests will conflict, and on which it is important that there should be an independent decision.          Such a Department must be in charge of aIlinister of the Crown who would be responsible to Hisliajesty^ Government for petroleum policy.          The need for a clearly defined and settled oilpolicy is daily becoming more apparent, and this is recognised by the Prench, who have recently constituted a separate Llinistry of Petroleum under the charge of aSenator, and are taking up a very decided attitude onpetroleum questions at the Peace Conference.  The Italianshave taken a somewhat similar step, and this country, towhich petroleum is even more vital, should not be allowedto be at a disadvantage through lack of a similar organ-ization.          The staff necessary for manning the department would be small and its cost would be trifling as  corn-pared with the importance of the work to be accomplished.                                W.H.L.                                    27*2*19.
