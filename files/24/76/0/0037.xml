*FURTHER  REPORTS ON  VISITS  TO  GERMANY,            13th TO 15th FEBRUARY, 1919.CIRCULATED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.           SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT  ON A VISIT TO  CASSEL,               13TH TO 15TH FEBRUARY, BY CAPTAIN C. W. BELL.     With reference to the preliminary report prepared by Captain Stewart Roddie, Captain Tennant, and myself, when we were in Berlin, I have  little  to add, except that I consider it incorrect to state that the Arbeiter and Soldaten-Rat is &quot; all powerful throughout the  country.&quot;  As a  matter  of fact,  the Arbeiter  and Soldaten-Rat is &quot; represented&quot; in almost every official department but the reins are still in the bands&apos; of the  old regime,  which it is  recognized, is alone capable of manipulating them.  I came into contact with several cases of  high appointments which are still held by the ex-imperial officials, and  I know that the  Arbeiter and Soldaten-Rat were at one time terrified of being  landed  with the  administrative  posts, for they knew  they  were incapable of filling them.     It would be more correct to state  that the Arbeiter and Soldaten-Rat is merely a name.  On paper, it has considerable power, in practice  it is merely looking on and making itself rather troublesome to the men who have  been for years, and still are, at the wheel.                 .      &apos;                                VISIT TO CASSEL.     Captain Tennant and I left Berlin on Wednesday night, 12th February, by the Spa express  (8.47  p.m.).  I arrived at Cassel  on  Thursday  morning at 5.15.   The Babnhof Kommandantur  had  a letter for  me from  the  magistrate, outlining the programme which had been prepared and  informing me that a room had been booked at the Hotel Schirmer.     The main purposes for which I had decided to visit Cassel were :         (i.) In  order  to  meet  a certain lady  (English-born)  who  was coming there             expressly from Frankfurt to  see me.        (ii.) To  see  over the Henschel Locomotive Works some of the largest in the             world.       (iii.) To  inspect the Eisenbahn Reparation  Werkstiitte (Railway Repair Work-             shops).     I prefer at the  moment  not  to describe  in detail the conversations which I had with my lady friend.   They were,  however, extremely enlightening as  to the present state of affairs in Germany, and as  to the circumstances which have brought  this about. Some of the salient features were : -     1.  The absurdity of accusing the Kaiser for all that has happened.  He personally was against the war,  and he used all the influence he could muster to prevent          (a.) Air raids on open towns.         (6.) Unrestricted submarine warfare.         (c.) Deportation from Belgium.         (d.) Atrocities, such as the murder of Miss  Cavell.     He constantly tried to open  up Peace negotiations and was always  gagged by Ludendorff who,   together with  the  Crown  Prince,  and with  the  influence of Hindenburgs name, did what he  liked  almost  from the start.  Ludendorff is now an outcast in Sweden and to use my friend&apos;s own words, &quot; She would like to strangle him.&apos;&apos;     (B19/135)  60  3/19 H&amp;S  6932wo
    If the Kaiser is put on trial, German Monarchists will gain  a  big victory.  Manydisclosures will be made, unpleasant to both sides, and no good will come of it as far as england is concerned.    2. The German people are still childishly ignorant,  to-day, of  the truth, so far asit concerns the past.   They know that they have been fooled, but that is  all.   It willbe a revelation to them when they find out how hated they are almost the whole worldover.    3. Peace was nearly offered to the Allies after the first battle of the Marne.  TheGermans had then exhausted their ammunition supplies and the  situation was quitedesperate.    4. Peace was again nearly offered at the end of the successful  campaign in Russia(1916).   Ludendorff, however, would not hear of it.    5. Desperation reigned&apos;in April, 191/, but again Ludendorff, at  the expense ofdismissing generals and politicians wholesale, insisted on continuing.    6. Men speaking French and English are being recruited by the Bolshevists and offered large sums  of money to spread  Bolshevistic propaganda in France, Belgium,occupied Germany and even in England.    7. The German Navy&apos;s version of the battle of Jutland is that it was a victory  forthem  in so far as they succeeded in  extricating  themselves  from  an  almost  hopelessposition, inflicting severe losses on us, and sustaining heavy losses  but  not completedestruction themselves.   Our shooting, according to an officer of the &quot; Moltke,&quot; was not good, and we fired a lot of duds.    8. Germany is really and truly in a desperate state  as regards  food.   The  poor are suffering horribly, and some of the most unfortunate cases  are  amongst  the  Germanofficials, whose incomes are always small, and who can now merely exist by the rationsthey get.  Everyone&apos;s constitution has  suffered  so  much that  there  is  no power of resistance, and when illness comes it is  hard  to shake off.   The  mortality  amongstwomen, children and the  aged has been awful  for years past,  and it  is  at its worstto-day.  Unless help comes soon, total  calamity  stares- Germany  in the  face.  Therewill be robbery, bankruptcy, and general Bolshevism, and these things will not confinethemselves to Germany, they, are certain to spread.     9.  If a form of help was to be suggested, the best  might be a partial, if not total,lifting of the blockade, the sense of which even the  most broad minded German could see.  Germany is laid low, she is quite helpless, there is no longer  any question of  herbeing a menace to anyone, but she may  easily develop into one if she is allowed to runcompletely riot.     My visits to&apos;the  repair workshops and  Henschefs  Were both  very  remunerative.I saw quite clearly  chat Germany is at her wits end in the matter  of rolling stock, andthat raw material for repairs is almost non-existent.     All new engines, now  under construction,  are  being fitted with iron instead of copper fireboxes.   For certain other  fixtures, usually all copper, a  mixture of variousmetals, copper zinc, &amp;c, is resorted to.  Packings and joints are no  longer  of asbestosbut of a worthless substance, which literally  crumples up in ones hands, and which heatmust eat through in no time.   There is no tin at all.  Locomotives and wagons which one sees in process of being patched up  would in normal times be ready for scrapping.     First class carriages whose seats were formerly of plush, are now of paper.  I sawthem myself and took samples of the cloth.   Henschefs are working in two shifts, day and night employing  over 9,000 workmen and turning out two to three locomotivesdaily.  They are well supplied with iron and steel but are living from  hand to mouthin the matter of coal.     The  repair workshops of &quot; Eisenbahn Direktion XL&quot; (the largest of  which is thatat Cassel, but there are three in all) are likewise employing thousands  of workmen,half of whom  (as also at Henschefs)  are  still  in uniform.  They handle  anythingbetween 250 and 275 locomotives at a time.     I was told that there are 21 &quot;Eisenbahn Direktioner&quot; in Germany and that eachhas a &quot; line command.&quot;  Rittmeister Duties (2nd Jager zu  Pferde),  Commandant ofthe local Prisoners of War  Camp, escorted  me on my round, which included a formalvisit  to XI. Corps  Headquarters (Chief of Staff, Oberst leutnant Bronsart v.  Schellen-doif), and interviews with the local food controllers, also casual visits to various houses.     A few words will suffice on the food question because  Colonel Dillon has alreadydealt with that.  I  found things much as  my Berlin experience had led  me to expect.Cassel, however, is singularly well managed. The unemployed only number 1,200 or so.The system of rationing is  excellent, but there is much suffering.   I left Cassel on saturday morning at 4 a.m. and reached Cologne at mid-day, after an interesting talk
with a German gunner officer in a second class  carriage.   All that I  have seen andheard during my  fortnight in  Berlin and Cassel goes to convince me that the countryis helpless and that its condition may become desperate at any moment.   Hunger is atthe bottom of a good deal of the unrest.  If supplies could  be  let into the countrygradually and without  too  much  fuss, a revival might be  looked for.   I certainlyconsider that it is in the Allied interests not to drive Germany beyond the limits of herendurance.                                                   (Signed)   C. W. BELL,                                                                      Captain. REPORT  ON  VISIT  TO  LEIPZIG,  13TH  TO  14TH  FEBRUARY,  1919,  BY                         CAPTAIN  STEWART RODDIE.                                  INTRODUCTION.     I wish to prefix my report on my visit to Leipzig with these words :      To those who have had the opportunity of studying Germany recently from  the inside, the policy of  continuing the starvation  of that  country must  appear not only senseless but utterly harmful to ourselves.     My visit to  Leipzig  has strengthened  the conviction  to which the study of conditions in Berlin had already led me, namely, that the one  and only result must be disaster.  I believe that Germany at the present moment is on the brink of a volcano which may burst forth at any moment.  It would be folly to suppose that the  ensuing disaster would be confined to Germany.  The Bolshevists are  carrying  their campaign into Holland, Belgium and Britain.  It can only be wise to consider the  position with all seriousness while the power to avert impending disaster is still with us.     I arrived at Leipzig from Berlin at 2 a.m. on the morning of the 13th  instant; I was met by a Commissar of the  Police,  Doctor  Dorll, representing the Oberbiirger- meister.  He accompanied me to my hotel add called again next morning at 9.30.  I found that the Oberburgermeister had placed his car at my disposal for the period of my visit, and had arranged a programme of visits and  conferences.  I  adhered in  the main to the programme, but  altered various details, visiting factories and houses  other than those arranged for.               &apos;     Here, as  in Berlin,  I was  treated with  punctilious courtesy, and  without  the slightest suggestion  of servility.   I met  and talked with many people whom I had known in pre-war days, and  am more convinced than ever of the necessity of bringing home to&quot;the German people  the  truth regarding Germany&apos;s responsibility for the war, and  the reasons for, what they imagine  to be, &quot; the  incomprehensibly bitter way inwhich Germany is now being treated by the Allies.&quot;                                           (Signed)  W.  STEWART  RODDIE,                                                                 Captain, R.F.A.                                  I. ECONOMIC.     Leipzig, owing to its geographical position and to the fact that the population ofthe surrounding country is industrial and not agricultural, is economically in a worse position even than Berlin.   Carrots, turnips, dried beans, cabbage and beet have formed the staple diet of rich and poor for months past.   The meat supply is  not sufficient togive the people the amount to which this rationing system entitles them.  I visited theslaughterhouse, which is the centre from which all meat is  distributed.  About 600cattle per week are killed, and on  this the  population of 400,000 to 500,000 is fed.Pork was  almost non-existent.  A number  of goats were killed.  All scraps, offal andawful, are made into sausages and  sold at 3 to 7 marks per pound.  Rigid economy isobserved.     The cattle  were in a terribly emaciated  condition, fed principally on straw, as  thepeople are now  eating what formerly cows were fed on.     The potato ration has been much reduced since  the time of the last report fromLeipzig.     (6932)
     I visited seven families, rich, middle class and poor.   All were living on practicallythe same  diet.   There was plenty of money, but  nothing essential could be boughtwith it.     Leather boots and woollen goods are no longer to be had.   &quot; Kriegstoffe &quot; a sort of shoddy and paper are  used for  clothing.   The  former is  very  expensive and  has very little wear in it.  Paper and cretonne underclothing are all that can be had by anybut the very rich,     The market was practically empty,   I saw  queues of people waiting for fish at11 a.m.   Many of them  had been there, on a bitterly cold morning, since 6 a.m.   I  was told that  fish was expected, but there would not be  sufficient to  supply one-tenth ofthose waiting.     The  people are ill-clothed and  underfed,  and  the  younger  generation  under-developed.  As elsewhere,  the  lack  of coal is  apparent.  The  town authorities statethat they can keep going for another four weeks at the present  rate,  but that after thatthe situation will be desperate.     Industry is at little  more than a standstill.   What can be  done with  the materialon hands  is being done, but the lack  of raw material and coal prevents any appreciableamount of work being carried out.&quot;  The people are willing to work.   Wages are not so high as in Berlin, about 30 per cent. less.  The number of unemployed increases rapidly.     Agricultural labour  is  difficult to get, owing  to the  scarcity of  boots  and clothes,The  majority of both employed and  unemployed are clad in  uniform, good, bad  andindifferent.     The  manufacturers  themselves  are in a bad way, as  they have to  take on allreturned employees at the present  high scale of wages.   The  result is  that they arepaying large sums from capital for unnecessary labour.     I visited four factories, two of which I knew to have been making munitions.  Inotified no  one previously of these  visits, so was satisfied that  nothing had beenarranged  for me.   One, Bleicharfs  wire-rope  factory, had  an  immense  supply ofunfinished shell cases: these are now being rernelted and farm implements are beingmanufactured.   Munition production  there  and  in  the  other factory  I  visited  hasentirely ceased.     These factories  run  &quot;war kitchens.&quot;  The diet, as elsewhere,  consists of carrots,turnips, &amp;c, thickened with rye or potatoe flour ; a horrible concoction called &quot; Ersatz &quot;coffee was also to be had.     During my two days&apos;  visit I  interviewed the municipal and military authorities,visited four factories, four municipal  kitchens and seven families,  and  inspected  theslaughterhouse  and market.    Everywhere I received the impression of the necessityfor, immediate relief.     It is  not only food that is required,   The people must be  occupied as well as  fed.and they must be clothed if they are to work.  It is entirely in our interest to get theGerman to work, and the means essential to that end  are  food, clothes, raw material and coal.                                 II. MILITARY.     Owing to the lack of time  and to the fact that Lieut.-Colonel Cornwall had recently reported on the situation in Leipzig,  I dispensed with enquiries, which would only haveelicited information already given.     I was received  on  the morning of the 14th by the General  Commanding  theXIX. Corps  District, the  Intendentur in charge  of supplies and the representative ofthe Arbeiter and Soldaten-Rat.     Demobilization- is being carried  out as  quickly as  possible, but the  difficulty of finding  employment for the  men  is  a  great  hindrance.    There are  now  70,000undemobilized troops in  the district,  as  compared with  90,000  at the  time  of  thelast  report.   These include immobile troops, passing  transport, and hospital patients.Every effort is made to find employment for the men.     The ration is nominally the same as formerly, but the supply is insufficient to meetthe demand.  The meat  ration  has been reduced,  unofficially, by 40 gramms.  &apos;   The present stores will last till about the end  of  February.  After that, they willhave to depend on supplies from  the Central  Supply Department, Berlin, who havestated that they can ration all troops until next harvest.   The Leipzig authorities placelittle faith in this statement.   They  say that certain supplies, to which they have been entitled for the past  2 months,  have not been delivered and that their applications  are taken no notice of.     The soldiers are giving no trouble.  There is a general expectation of imminentrelief, which, if not forthcoming will, it is believed, be the cause of grave  disorder.
                                 III. POLITICAL. *    The Sparticist and  Independent Socialist elements are very  strong in  Saxony.The country here, however, seems to have settled down under the new regime.    Municipal  affairs are administered as before the revolution, and the more or lessnominal supervision of the Arbeiter and Soldaten-Rat becomes daily less assertive.  Aslong as things remain peaceable, it is unlikely that this body will attempt to exercise)any further power than at present.                         -    The representatives  in Leipzig appear to be honest men who have the good of thepeople at heart.   One finds  the same general horror  of Bolshevism here as in Berlin,but the  expectation  of  a sudden outburst is not so  strong as in the  capital.  the popular belief is  that as soon as food comes into the country and work is resumed, thechange  from Monarchism to Republicanism will prove to be one wholly for the better.Ebert is regarded as a decent man, who will do in  the meantime as President; but thegeneral feeling is  that a much  more picturesque  figure will eventually be required torepresent the nation.    One frequently hears the name of Prince Max  of Baden mentioned in this respect.    War weariness is everywhere apparent.   I had  many free exchanges of opinion withpeople of all classes and professions ; they one and all say &quot; Militarism is dead.&quot;    The King  of  Saxony&apos;s parting remark on abdication, &quot; Now you can clean up your own dirt,&quot; is likely to become a classic.  The people say that they are no longer goingto clean up the mess they have been left, and, they add, &quot; If the armistice terms are such as will not  make  it worth while our  cleaning up  the mess, the Entente will haveto come and do  it for themselves, only they will probably  find that by  that time themess has become so bad that they will get nothing  out of the refuse.&quot;    The feeling against  the  French  is very bitter.  The German people believe that america and England especially England are  being led by the nose, and that wereit  not  for  France, actuated only by the spirit of revenge, Germany would be treatedvery differently.    The people blame the military authorities for the war; the military  blame theinefficient politicians.  These  in turn blame Austrian diplomacy, and so on. Few blamethe Kaiser, who is thought of- when anyone has time to&apos;think of him as an egoisticalass, or, by  the  generous,  as an  unpractical  idealist.  The few who do blame him are ofthe opinion that the  Hohenzollern Party  felt that the democratic  development  ofGermany was  becoming  a  menace to the  throne, and that the only way to fix thedynasty firmly was by means  of a short, glorious and&apos; successful war.    As in Berlin, one found a  ridiculous  ignorance  of the reasons of the&quot; presenttreatment of Germany by the Entente.THE PEOPLE SHOULD BE TOLD.
