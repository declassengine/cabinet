If he does so claim he will be medically examined and his apers forwarded to the Ministry when he is dispersed on de-mobilisation.     In view of the arrangements made by the War Office for the rapid release of men on general demobilisation, it is expected that huge numbers of claims will reach the Ministry daily.  These ten will not be in the category of Hospital cases or cases needing treatment, which will continue to be dealt with under existing irrangements, but will be men who are  serving with their Units aid are therefore fit for military service, and the disabilities (if any) torn which they may be suffering will probably in most cases be slight.     In order to enable these cases to be dealt with more rapidlyIt has been decided that in any  case in  which  the  degree of incapacity is less than 20% the award of gratuity or  allowanceU3-3Y 3Sli8/1772  30m (4)  1/19 J.P.

I am to point out further that these men are not invaland will not be discharged as medically unfit,  but will be ( -charged, transferred to the Reserve, or disembodied on demobilition.

THE  CINEMATOGRAPH   INDUSTRY.                         PART I.                   GENERAL REMARKS.  This industry  comprises  two distinct branches:  The  pro-duction and distribution of films; the presentation of the films.  Under  the first head are included1 the services of actors, scene-shifters, electricians, carpenters, propertymen, cameramen,  menwho develop the films, salesmen, &amp;c.  Under the second head areincluded   electricians,  operators,   musicians,   doormen   andattendant!.          SUITABILITY PGR DISABLED MEIS.  As most of these processes are not peculiar to the industry, anaas.they are covered by other. Reports no further mention is madeof them here.  The  work of operators,  doorkeepers, and atten-dants at Picture Theatres which affords good  openings are  dealtwith in detail below.(1) Operators and Operators&apos;  Assistants.  The worker needs  the full use of both his arms  and all hisfingers, though no  strong grip pressure  is required.  It is an excellent opening for men who have lost one leg, so long as  theyare able to walk about, as the operator can  sit down part of thetime.   Several men have been already trained for this work whohave been injured in  the leg or have had a leg amputated.   Goodeyesight is essential, but good hearing is not.  Some degree ofnervous strain is involved.   The work is light in character, andis carried out under cover,  where  there is  little dust,  noise orvibration.  In the  larger  Theatres  the  temperature  in theoperator&apos;s box is almost normal, but it must be noted that in the older  types of  Picture Theatres,  and in some of  the  smallermodern ones, the operator&apos;s box  is very small and the atmospherevery close and hot.  Any man with a tendency  to  pulmonarydisease should not be sent to this type of theatre;(2) Doorkeeper&apos;.  This is also work of a light chai;acter, performed partly indoorsand partly out of doors, and  is admirably suited for men who arecertified by doctors to be fit only for light work, though  it mustbe remembered  that a man has to stand at  the  door in alljveathers.   In  a small Theatre the doorkeeper might,  also berequired  to do the cleaning, but in a larger Theatre his  only   (11/18.)  (20775r- 14a.)  Wt. 35792-527. 11.000.  12/18.  D &amp; S.  6-4.
business is to supervise others.  A man with one arm or withoutthe use of most of his fingers could perform the work.  In placingmen in this position who have been injured in the leg it must beremembered that a  great deal of standing is involved.(8)  Attendant.  The work is mainly carried on indoors, but owing to the amountof bodily movement required a man injured either in the arms orlegs would be handicapped.   At some Theatres both doormen andattendants assist in  distributing window bills and posters.                 GENERAL PROSPECTS.Operators and Operators&apos; Assistants.  the rev are , about  4,00U  Picture  Theatres  in  the  UnitedKingdom, 60 per cent, of which  employ one assistant as well asan operator.  The trade is rapidly growing, and it is anticipatedthat the present shortage of workers will be felt also after  thewar, since many local byelaws do not allow young persons under18 to take  charge of the machines,  and for various reasons  thework is not suitable for women.(2)  Doorkeepers and Attendants.  There  is always a steady demand for  reliable men to act asdoorkeepers and as attendants.  These  posts  afford  an  opportunity  of  promotion  to betterpositions.
                         PART II.                        TRAINING.  Cinema  Operating has  been  declared  by  the  Minister  ofPensions to be a &quot; Special Trade &quot; for the purposes of Instruction23 issued under Article  6 of the Royal Warrant of March, .1917,and the  following supplementary instructions  have  been issuedby the Ministry of Pensions to Local War Pensions committees to regulate  the training of  disabled  sailors and soldiers in  theTrade:-SUPPLEMENTARY  INSTRUCTIONS  ISSUED  BY  THE  MINISTRY  OF    PENSIONS TO REGULATE  THE TRAINING OF DISABLED  MEN IN    CINBMA OPERATING.  In order that the training of disabled men may be so regulatedas not to conflict with the interests of employers and employedin the Cinema Trade, the Minister of Pensions has, after con-sultatibn with the Ministry  of Labour and the National  CinemaTrade Advisory  Committee,   laid   down  in  accordance withInstruction  23 under Article 6 of the Royal Warrant of March1917, the following  conditions to be observed in regard to  thetraining  of  men as  Cinema  Operators, hereafter to  be deemed a&quot; Special Trade &quot; for the purposes  of that Instruction.  Any course of training already being given  or proposed to begiven by a  Local War  Pensions Committee shall, if the ailow-anees or fees under Article 6 of the  Royal  Warrant are to bepaid, comply with the following conditions, unless in  any  ease the&apos;Minister of Pensions otherwise determines.  (1) Training in cinematograph operating may only be given ata centre  that has been approved by the Minister of Pensions.*  (2) The course of training  at any  centre shall be for  a maxi-mum period of .13 weeks, and shall consist partly of theoreticalinstruction  at a technical school or  similar institution and partly of practical teaching in projection.   Such instruction  shall befor a period of not less than 30 hours per week.  (3) Where any training for Cinematograph Operating has beenapproved by the Minister of  Pensions, and where the Ministerof Labour on the advice of the National  Cinema Trade AdvisoryCommittee  has set  up,  for the area in which.the training is tjbe  given, a Local Technical  Advisory Committee  consisting ofan  equal number of representatives of associations of employersand workpeople respectively, then  provided such Committee  is recognised by the Ministry of Pensions after  consultation withthe Ministry of Labour as  representative of  the Trade in that  *  The National Cinema Trade Advisory Committee will be consulted as to suitable centres.20776B
area, the Local War Pensions Committee hy whom the training has been arranged  shall consult  this Local Technical AdvisoryCommittee with regard to the following points :      (a)  The selection of candidates  for training with regard  to           their suitability for the trade.  &apos;  (6)  The snitahility of the training offered both in the tech-           nical school and in projection.    (c)  The suitability  of  any offers made by employers for the           employment  of men after training  with special refer-           ence to the prospects  of permanent employment and           the rate of wages offered at the termination of the           training.    (d)  Any  other  technical points  arising out of the training           for Cinematograph Operating.  (4) The Local Technical Advisory Committee shall  inform theLocal War Pensions Committee and the National Cinema TradeAdvisory Committee if,  at any time, in their opinion  a sufficient number of men have been trained for their trade in  the .centrein question,  having regard to the  number of men  which thetrade in the area  with which they are familiar could  reasonably be expected to absorb.  N.P5. The National  Cinema Trade Advisory Committee will issue certificates  to men who  have gone through a  course  oftraining and  who have passed an  examination to the satisfaction of the Local  Technical Advisory  Committee, in accordance withthe conditions laid down by the National Cinema Trade AdvisoryCommittee.                     TRAINING  CENTKES.(1) Cinema Operators,  la London a training centre solely  for  disabled sailors andsoldiers was established in the early days of the war.   The manreceived his theoretical tuition at  the Polytechnic, Regent Street,and his practical training in a  private  Projection Theatre andWorkshop.  Experience  showed that an  intelligent man of anadaptable nature, even without previous knowledge of electricityor engineering, could in such an  intensive course be taught and placed  as  a first-class assistant operator in about 13 weeks.  Additional training  centres have now  been established  in birmingham,* Bournemouth, Cardiff, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool,Manchester, Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Nottingham.  Local Technical Advisory Committees have  been set up by theMinistry of Labour on the advice of the National  Cinema TradeAdvisory Committee in the 10 centres mentioned above to advise the Local War Pensions Committees in  regard to the  training  ofdisabled men  in accordance with the Supplementary Instructions.* In course of formation.
                        -TECHNICAL ADVICE.     Mr.  Paul  Kimberley,  wbo  initiated the  London  Training   Centre,  has been appointed Honorary Technical Adviser to the   National Cinema Trade Advisory Committee.   Any communlca-   tions in  regard to technical matters should be addressed to him atI   167, Wardour Street, London, W.l.                     SELECTION OE MEN.                            A 5  An Application form  JQinema g  *s ^ssuec&apos;  by ^e NationalCinema Trade Advisory Committee for every applicant for train-ing upon which the facts of his case and his qualifications must be entered.   This form,  after it has been  filled in by or on behalfof the applicant, must be sent through the Local War pensions committee for-the area in which  the training centre is  situatedto the Local  Technical Advisory Committee for that area.  TheLocal Technical Advisory Committee will then  advise the local war  Pensions Committee (if necessary, after a personal inter-view  with  the applicant) whether the  applicant  is suitable fortraining.                     METHOD OF TRAINING.  The training of men  for  the position  of  a CinematographOperator must be theoretical and practical to  achieve  the bestresults, namely, the highest degree of efficiency in order to ensure to the Operator the highest reward for his  services, the greatest possible satisfaction to the Employer by the proper use of theapparatus,  and the greatest pleasure to the  public by the artisticresults attainable from the skilled use of such apparatus.  A  man  may in a short period be  taught  to  operate  the machine to project the picture but he will not be entitled to regardhimself as  a skilled  Operator, nor could he expect  to have per-manent employment  until he had acquired a knowledge of theprinciples  of electrical science  as applied  to the industry; the care,  maintenance, use and repair of the machines, apparatus and appliances  in use.  The men who are selected for training shouldbe  encouraged  to  take  the  whole  course of  theoretical and practical instruction provided.  The theoretical instruction must be given at a  technical school or similar institution  approved by the  Ministry  of Pensions.  The practical instruction must be provided by skilled instruc-tors and in a projection room, which will generally  be placed atthe disposal of the local committee by  members of the trade whohave  kindly consented to  give every facility for  the use of theirapparatus and material for the  purpose.   Arrangements shouldbe made  to enable advanced students to secure wider experience in charge  of skilled  Operators  at  local picture theatres undertrade  conditions.
                         SYLLABUS.  .  The National Cinema Trade Advisory Committee has preparedai Syllabus (see Appendix A) for the use of the instructors at thedifferent training centres.             EXTENSION OF PERIOD  OF  TRAINING.  In  the. case  of  any man who in the opinion of the  LocalTechnical Advisory Committee  is  unable on  completion  ofthe 13 weeks&apos; course of training to command an adequate wageon entering employment, the Local War  Pensions committee may apply to the  Ministry of Pensions for an extension of thetraining period with maintenance, provided that such an exten-sion is only applied for on the ground of some special reason foraon-proficiency.                        CERTIFICATES.  Certificates specifying  that men are qualified for  employment will be issued only by the National Cinema  Trade Advisory Oom-mittee and only to men who have gone through the course oftraining  provided  and who have  passed an examiniation to thesatiafaction  of  the  Local  Technical Advisory  Committee,  inaccordance with the conditions laid down by the National CinemaTrade Advisory Committee.

EQUIPMENT.  A  set of tools will  be required by  each man on passing hisexamination after  training.   A  list  of  these tools is  given  inAppendix B.                          WAGES .   ;  Instruction  (3) (c)  quoted above lays  down  that the  local war  Pensions Committee shall consult  the  Local  TechnicalAdvisory  Committee with regard to  the  rate of wages  offeredat the termination of training.   In connection  with this clause the National  Cinema Trade Advisory  Committee have  unani-mously agreed that &quot; the rate of wages  shall be the trade unionrate  for the district where the man is to be employed  if  such separately  exists,  failing which the Local  Techmcal Advisory Com-mittee shall decide what the minimum rate should be.   If theLocal  Technical Advisory  Committee fail to agree they  shallrefer   the  matter  to  the  National  Cinema  Trade  AdvisoryCommittee.&quot;
HOURS OF WORK.  In  Theatres  giving&apos; continuous performances from  2 p.m. to11 p.m., time is allowed off for meals, but about two hours&apos;  pre-paratory work  in  the  morning, commencing about  11 a.m., isrequired.  In  Theatres  only open in  the  evening  or  for  evenings  andoccasional matinees the hours are fewer.               NUMBER OF MEN TO BE TRAINED.  The Local Technical Advisory Committees send monthly reports to the  National Cinema Trade Advisory Committee as to thenumber of men who are being trained in their Training Centres.By this means  the National Cinema Trade Advisory  Committeewill be in a position to notify the Ministry of Pensions  if, in theiropinion, more men are being trained than the trade  as a whole*van reasonably lie expected to absorb.               MAINTENANCE DURING TRAINING.  A disabled man, if eligible to be given training by his local war  Pensions  Committee,  receives  during  the course of lvistraining an allowance of 27s. Qd. (more if he has been a non-commissioned officer) with allowances for  children  at  the rateof 6s. Sd.  for the first child, 5*.  for the second  and 4s. 2d. toyeach subsequent child, and if this training necessitates his livingaway  from home,  and he is married, a further allowance is givenfor his wife of  .13s.  9d., together with the usual allowances for children.  In cases where a man is obliged to live away from home whe iundergoing a course of training,  arrangements will  be  made bythe Local  War Pensions Committee for  his lodging, for whichthe man will be  charged 17s.  Qd. a week, the additional  costbeing defrayed  by the Local War Pensions Committee.  Where  a man is married  and resides at  his own home whilotunder training, the Local War Pensions Committee may, subjectto certain  conditions being satisfied, make  to him an additional allowance  not exceeding 7s.  Gd. a week,  if considered  necessarvfor the clue up-keep  of the home.  When a course of training has been completed, a special bonus,equal to 5s. per week for each  week the  training with  mainten-ance lasts, will be paid by  the Ministry to  the man,  providedthat- a certificate  of satisfactory  attendance has been given bythe  Training  Sub-Committee  of  the  Local  War   pensions committee.
10                APPLICATIONS FOB TRAINING.  Applications  for or on  behalf of individual disabled  menwishing to be trained, or from employers wishing to employ suchdisabled  men, should be  addressed  to the  nearest Local  WarPensions Committee.  Communications for the National Cinema Trade Advisory Coin-mittee (Disabled Sailors and Soldiers) should be addressed to :  The Secretary,     The National Cinema Trade Advisory Committee.                    8, Argyll Street,                                London, W.l.
                             SYLLABUS.THIS SYLLABUS  HAS  BEEN DRAWN UP FOR THE USE  OF  THE  INSTRUCTORS AT THE                      DIFFERENT TRAINING CENTRES.  Each, beginner should  be given first a brief but simple explanation ofthe governing principles  of Cinematography, then taken through  a courseof instruction, in  approximately  the following order:      1.  The escapement, or the method by which the intermittent motion          is imparted  to the film.    2.  The illuminant.    ii.  The condenser.    4.  The objective or  projection lens.    o.  The shutter.    6.  The screen upon which the picture is projected.  Uuder heading  1 the escapement.  The different methods, such as thepin. or claw,  maltese cross,  dog or  beater  movements,  should all be explained in detail.  Under heading  2 the illuminant.  Arc-light,  lime-light, oxy-acetylene,and the smaller powered  illuminarrts  should  be  dealt with.  Principalattention should be given to the arc-light.   Carbons different types andsizes  of carbons  in use for  direct or  alternating  current  at  variouspressures.  The different types of arc-lamps, centring  and adjustment ofthe arc-lamp  in tho lamphouse, to  get perfect  projection.  Switchboard,fuses,  resistance,  wiring from Motor Generators or company&apos;s  mains tothe arc-lamp.   The sources of supply,  such as     (A) direct from the oompany&apos;s mains Alternating or Direct current,    (B) from  accumulators,    (c) Electric and other Generators.Limelight.   The  different types of regulators, gauges, jets, etc.   Thevarious sources of supply of gas.  Under heading  3 explain the functions of  the  condenser; giving illus-trations of the different types of condensers in use, such as plano-oonvex,double convex and meniscus, and explain the measures that must be  takento  avert  breakage of  condenser.  tJnder this heading  &quot;light  cut-offs&quot;should be dealt with.  TJnder heading  4 the objective should be carefully  dealt with, explain-ing very fully the relationship between the length  of throw, focus of lens,etc., to the size of picture.  The relationship between  the centring of thelight, projection lens and gate masking, together with  the proper cleaningand care of lens,  should be enlarged upon.  TJnder heading  5 the shutter  and  its functions needs  explanation  indetail  and the relationship of the shutter to the escapement of  whatevertype of movement may be in use  with the  different machines.    How&quot;*ghost &quot; should be dealt  with.  TJnder heading  6 different types of screens  should be explained,  notforgetting that there are still a number of picture  theatres in this country where  transparent screens  are in use.  It is necessary that the importanceof the position  of the  screen in conjunction with  the  projector  should be impressed  upon pupils,  and of  the vital  importance of a screen  beingparallel to and central with the lens.  After the above six  points have been fully covered,  the pupils should bemade familiar with as many different types of projectors as possible. the types mostly in use should be those  chosen.  Opportunities should be giventhe pupils during some  part of their training of examining and using as many  different types  of projectors  as  may be available in the immediatevicinity of the training school.  Electrical  supply for  illuminant.  The theory  at  any  rate should  betaught  at  the technical   school,   followed up by  practical  lessons  inwiring, etc.  Pupils shoujd be made familiar with operating boxes in modern theatres,and the reasons  for safety  shutters, spool  boxes  and light eut-offs,  also with the provision of  the Cinematograph Act, State, County and BoroughAPPENDIX  A.
Council Regulations,  and the Regulations of Railway Companies  for the transit, of films, etc.  Pupils should be given opportunities of handling andrewinding films, making them up  into programmes,  repairing films, etc.Particular  attention should  be  given to  accurate and clean joining, thedifference between  inflammable and  non-inflammable film,  together withthe necessary cements that are in general use.  During the course of  training practical and theoretical  lessons shouldbe  given on resistances and fuses,  and  practical  illustrations shown  oftandem  resistances  for  dissolving purposes, together with a  course  of instruction  on  small  projector  driving  motors,  motor  generators  andswitchboard work.  Before a  pupil  leaves a training  centre he should also  be  thoroughlyfamiliar with the methods of preparing, writing  and projecting  lanternslides, particularly emphasising the  reasons why  the lantern slides must always  be placed in a slide  carrier upside down.  It is  also necessary  topoint out that a slide does not require nearly so much light as a film.  The training should  be  divided  into two sections theoretical  and practical.  The  theoretical side of the electrical  training will  be  coveredby  the technical institute, and the field to be dealt Avith by the instituteshould  be as follows:  Explanation of  Ohm&apos;s  law,  difference between, alternating and con-tinuous  current,  use of ampere  meters,  volt  meters,  switches,  fuses,carrying capacity  of wire, methods of making joints in cable, wire  testing,etc.  Electrical wiring from  (1) company&apos;s mains through resistances to thearr: lamps,  (2) Company&apos;s mains to  motor generator,  through regulatingresistances, switchboard to  arc lamp.   The theory  of the  internal com-combustion  engine,  gas and  oil engines.   Power transmission to dynamo,dynamo to  either resistance and arc lamp or to accumulators, and fromaccumulators to regulating  resistance  and  arc  lamp.

LETTERING.                     &amp;                            PREFACE.                         ;  1  This Report is one of a series which is being issued by the Minisjfof Labour in collaboration with the Ministry, of Pensions, and lias bprepared by  the  Handicraft Advisory Committee for  Lettering.   rJinformation is intended not  only for the use of the Local War PensiCommittees, Employment Exchanges, Technical Schools, Schools of Aand  Military Hospitals, but also for the  use  of Employers and Woipeople and any who are interested in the problem of the  disabled sailand soldier.  Local War Pensions  Committees are&apos; making enquiries as to the traand industrial processes in their own areas which are especially suitafor disabled men.   This series of reports  is confined to  trades which to be found in every part of the country or which cover a much wiarea  than that of any single Local Committee.   The information collecfor this Report will, of course, need to  be supplemented by the modetailed knowledge which Local Committees have already in their possision  or will be able  to acquire with regard to their own local condition    HANDICRAFT ADVISORY COMMITTEE (DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS).  A  Handicraft Advisory Committee has  been  set up by the Ministry iLabour in  conjunction with the  Ministry of  Pensions to  advise the;Departments as to the  conditions under which the training of  disablemen  in Lettering can best be given,  the best methods of training, tlisuitable centres for  such training and generally to secure uniformity ithe  training of  disabled  men.    The  Committee  is constituted ifollows:          E. V. Burridge (CHAIRMAN).        M. Gill.        B. J. Eletchei\        II. J. Manwaring.        W. Augustus  Steward.        A. L. Dakyns (SECRETARY), representing the Ministry of Laboiii  A  representative of the Ministry of Pensions also attends the meeting in a  consultative capacity.                      GENERAL  REMARKS.  Of recent years there has been a growing demand for  good letteringnotably in  the following trades or crafts:       (A) Ticket writing.     (B) Commercial lettering.     (c) Sign writing.     (D) Monumental lettering.     (e) Metal engraving and stencil cutting.   In each  of these there is room  for skilled men who have  received  adefinite and systematised training such as that proposed below.                           PROSPECTS.   A number of openings in these crafts for disabled men will probablybe found in existing workshops, and  there are further opportunities foi
lijen  of intelligence  and initiative and more especially those  who  havefd early training in a school of art ultimately to set up in business for einselves.istS10 A                           SUITABILITY.   In  the  case  of lettering,  as  in  the  case of other handicrafts  which^Aessitate possession  of artistic skill  and aptitude of  a special kind, Ijre should be taken to select only  suitable men for training.  With this   tl in view the Committee recommend that only those should be accepted   r training who either have had previous  experience  bearing on the^01 ift  or have shown aptitude during convalescence at institutions whichailovide means  of practise at handicrafts, and  that the  first month of   lining should be regarded as  a trial period, at the end of which, if in-at 3 opinion of  the instructor the man is not likely to become an efficienttaliftsman, his  training should  cease.   The following observations in regard  to  types  of physical disability   dch would not render a  man unsuitable for  training  are of a quite ctaeral character, and are offered merely  as a  guide to Local War   pensions Committees in selecting suitable candidates for training; they   ist  also  be supplemented  and corrected by the remarks  in regard to   tability made under the  heads  of the different branches of the craft   e below, pages       ):      Unfitness for heavy work (on medical certification).    Chest  complaints.    Weak heart.    Certain  kinds of shell shock.    Loss of  one eye, if the sight  in the remaining eye is  good.  Good        eyesight, however, is specially necessary in commercial lettering        and metal engraving.    Partial  deafness.    Loss of  a  leg (but in the case of sign-writing, a  man should have        two sound legs).    Partial  use  of one hand and arm  provided the remaining arm and        hand  are perfectly sound.  The kind of  partial use varies for        the  different branches  of  the craft.l  a]picHl()SSioirytinibl,  ttydbotinTEAINING.vei  The method of training should be adapted mainly to meet the needsthose men.who wish to be employed in workshops.  The whole training could not however be undertaken in the work-p, which, although at a later stage giving valuable experience, is notable for the teaching of  methods.  The first portion of the  traininguld be given in a technical  school well fitted for the purpose.,  This limits the centres of training to  those towns only where thereSchools of Art with adequate arrangements and teaching facilities.  During  the first stage of  training  (see below, clause 5), each man  be provided with  a set of  tools for training purposes, which he willgiven an  opportunity of purchasing, on completion of his period ofning  with Maintenance,  out of the grant for  tools payable by thelistry of  Pensions  (see  below  &quot;Maintenance  during  Training&quot;).;s of the tools required by a man during training  and on completionraining are given in the Appendices A to E of this Report.*baf These lists, especially as regards the prices mentioned, represent in general pre-war   itions.  Some of the tools may be found to be unobtainable at the present time: and   prices of all are liable to constant increase.   [18893-14a.)  Wt. 19897-188/100.  18,000. 12/18.  D &amp; S.  G. 4.
  5.  The length of training should be not less than two years divicleijinto two stages:                First  Stage Training with Maintenance.  The course of instruction should be planned  for a period of .12 montlifl(i.e., allowing for a fortnights holiday,  50  weeks), of which  38 weelJshould he spent in a School of Art, and  the  succeeding 12 weeks inworkshop.  I. School of Art course (30 to 40 hours per  week).             During this period  local employers  should from time        time he notified of the number of men in training for their trade        so  that  they may  be given an opportunity  of  visiting tin        school and interviewing the men, with a view to engaging then        for further training -and employment on completion  of  theii        course at the school.  II. Workshop course,  under trade conditions approved by the Handicraft Advisory Committee, for three months.  After a trial period of two weeks, if the  man proves suitable     (a)  The employer should undertake (i) to pay  him a minimum wagi           of 10s. a week  until the end of the period  of training wit!           Maintenance,  (ii)  to allow him time off during working hour           to attend a School of Art (where the facilities are available!           for not less than 8 hours a week  until the end of the full           period of training with Maintenance,  and (iii) to retain him           in his employ for at least one year longer at a rate of paj           of not less than 75 per cent, of the current rate prevailing iii r           the district for a skilled man.    (b)  The disabled man should  undertake (i) to remain with the same           employer during this period and (ii) not to set up in business           on his own account in the  branch of  Lettering  in  which lie           has  been trained in the same locality as that  in  which lie           receives this portion of his training.            Secojul Stage Training without  Maintenance.  Continuance of training in the workshop of the same  employer for aleast  12 months  under  the terms of the mutual  agreement mentionedabove, II (a) (iii) and (b) (i) and  (ii).                          TICKET  WRITING.  General  Remarks. Employment in the kind  of Ticket  Writing  ad-vocated in this Report is on the increase, and men of  exceptional talentmay also get the opportunity of designing for general commercial  work,Four different types of ticket writer are to be found in the  trade.     Type  1. A ticket writer working for a ticket-writing firm.     Type  2. A ticket  writer  working  for  a  firm requiring a  large                 number of tickets, such as  one of the larger drapery                 establishments  or a  multiple-shop firm.     Type  3. A part-time ticket writer who is primarily a salesman or                 shop assistant.  Such men are employed  hy  a variety                 of retail businesses.     Type 4. A ticket writer working for a personal connection, that is,                 for a number of  small  shops,  possibly in  a  provincial                 town.
     Suitability. For types 1 and 2 a one-legged man, or even a man who    as lost the use of both legs, would not be severely handicapped,   He   should have the full use of his right hand and preferably also of the left,   though this is  not essential.  Since, however, a ticket writer is usually   paid by piece-work rates, a  man who is handicapped in rapidity of hand   and wrist movements would be at a disadvantage.     Training for type 3  should be limited  to men who have been salesmen   or shop assistants and  who intend to return to their previous occupations    ut wish to equip themselves for better chances of employment.tl    For  types 3 and 4 the loss of a leg might be a disadvantage, as  such   men would require to  move about a good deal in connection  with their   work.                        COMMERCIAL LETTERING.    General Remarks. Employment in this work is on the  increase, and  men of exceptional  talent should get the opportunity of  designing for?(j billheads,  posters   and   general  commercial  work,  caligraphy   and  illuminating.    Suitability. Only those men should be selected who have good eye-  sight, full use of the right hand, and at least partial use of the left.  The  work is suitable for those medically certified to be unfit for heavy work.  For those men  who  desire to set up for themselves in business a sonie-  what higher degree  of physical capacity is necessary.    As this work includes the writing, designing and lay-out of advertise-  inents, catalogues  and booklets,  only those men who have had a fair  education should be accepted for training.  Syllabus of Instruction.Syllabus of Instruction.  (See Appendix A.)(See Appendix  B.)SIGN WRITING.   General Remarks. Sign writing is  regarded  as a  special branch ofpainting and  decorating.   It is  recognised as such in the training of apprentices, and the Committee are of opinion that there is  scope for thetraining as sign writers of a certain number of specially selected men whoare prepared to undertake a complete course of study.   Suitability. A  man suffering  from any  one  of the  following  dis-abilities would be able to follow  this craft:  Loss  of one  eye;  partialdeafness; loss of a couple of fingers on either  hand (but not thumb onright hand); chest complaints; weak heart; certain kinds of shell shock.   The training should be limited  (i)  to men who have been painters ordecorators before the  war; (ii) to  those men  who  have  taken  the course                                                               M. 5laid down by the Building Trade Advisory Committee (see Report  xjv^&apos;and who showed, in the opinion  of the Instructor during  the first six weeks of training promise of becoming good sign writers.   Local WarPensions Committees  should,, wherever possible,  consult the  BuildingLocal Technical Advisory  Committees  in  their areas in regard to  the suitability of men for  training in  this craft.Syllabus of Instruction.

                      MONUMENTAL LETTERING.   Genera!  Remarks. Monumental lettering&apos;  is regarded  as  a special branch  of masonry.    It is recognised  as  such  in the  training  of apprentices, and the Committee are of opinion that there is scope for thetraining as monumental letter cutters of  a  certain number of speciallyselected men who are prepared to undertake a complete course of study.   Suitability -The following disabilities would not prevent a  man from pursuing this craft: Loss of one eye; deafness;  injury  to arm; loss offinger on either hand; loss of one leg replaced hy artificial limb; weak-heart;  certain kinds of shell shook.   Training should be limited (i) to men  who have been masons  beforethe war; (ii)  to those men who have taken the course laid down by the                                              M. 5Building Trade Advisory Committee (see Report &quot;xiV^J au(^ WB0 snowei1in the opinion of the Instructor  during the  first six weeks&apos;  training pro-inise of becoming good monumental letter cutters.   Local War PensionsCommittees  should,  wherever  possible,  consult  the  Building   LocalTechnical Advisory Committees in their areas in regard to the  suitability of men lor training in this craft.Syllabus of Instruction,   (See Appendix D.)               METAL ENGRAVING AND STENCIL CUTTING.   General Remarks. In  modern usage,  engraving is divided into fourbranches, each of which may be found practised as a  craft by  itself.    I. Monumental brasses, stall-plates and other name plate engraving.   II. General Engraving,  is.,  inscriptions, monograms,  crests  and          coats of arms, on gold, silver,  ivory, horn  and celluloid; cut-          ting for enamelling;  metal carving.   III.  Ornamental engraving.   IV. Copper-plate engraving,   In  each of  these sub-divisions the craftsman  should he  a capabledesigner and able to  lay  out  lettering.  In the large centres, however,such as London,  Birmingham and  Sheffield, specialisation is  carried sofar that it is possible  for a man  to find employment in a section only ofone or other of these sub-divisions (e.y., engraving inscriptions, etc., ontable cutlei&apos;3&apos;).   But it is  undesirable to offer  a disabled man  so limiteda&apos; knowledge of the craft.   Stencil cutting  as a  separate section of  the trade was  always  badlypaid and as it only offers a limited sphere of employment it is generallypractised in connection  with brass engraving.   Suitability. Good  sight  and  soundness  of   hand   are   essential.Deafness or loss of speech would not disqualify, but some employers areaverse  to  employing such men  because of  the difficulty in explainingrequirements.   A man who  has lost a leg or even both  legs  would notbe severely handicapped for general engraving.  A considerable amountof standing, however, is required in monumental or general brass-plateengraving.  Loss of the  little finger of the  left hand would not  in general
7155disqualify a man,  but the  right hand  should  be  perfect and the leftcapable of gripping the brass  en graver&apos;s chisel, or, in the  case of  thegeneral engraver, articles such as watches, finger rings, spoons and salversor trays.   Men selected for instruction should have  an aptitude  fordrawing  and lettering.   Drawing is essential for heraldic and orna-niental work, and lettering for inscription work.Syllabus  of Instruct/ion.  (See Appendix E.)FUNCTIONS OP THE  HANDICRAFT ADVISORY  COMMITTEE.  The  Handicraft Advisory Committee acts in an advisory capacity  tothe Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Pensions.  1. In regard  to all suitable centres for training, whether in a school of Art, or in  a  workshop.  2. In regard  to the best methods of selecting men for  training.  3. In regard to any schemes of training in any of the  crafts that maybe covered by this Report that may be submitted to them from time  totime for their advice or approval.                 SCHOOLS  AND WORKSHOPS.  The Handicraft Advisory Committee suggests enquiries might be madeas to the training facilities both in Schools of  Art and workshops in thefollowing centres:                                  London, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool,                                  Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester,                                  Newcastle-on-Tyne.Ticket  Writing&apos;        .  ,  T0..  .     /        JNewcastie-on-lyne.Commercial  Lettering  I    .

MAINTENANCE  DURING TRAINING.  A disabled man,  if eligible to be given training by his Local WarPensions Committee, may receive during that part of his course which is spent in a School of Art an allowance of 27s. Qd. (more if he has been anon-commissioned officer), with  additional allowances for children atthe rate of 6s. 8d. for the first, 5s. for the second,  and 4s. 2d. for each subsequent child.  During the period of workshop  training with Main-tenance these allowances should be reduced by 10s.  a week in respect ofthe minimum  wage payable by the employer.  In addition  to these  allowances,  any  fees in respect of training in a school of  Art  will be paid by the Minister, and an  amount equal to 5s.for each week the training with maintenance lasted,  will  be paid by theMinistry to the  man at the end of the period of training with main-tenance as a bonus for satisfactory attendance, together with a grantnot exceeding  10 for the purchase of tools.188U3

      Section I.  Pianoforte and Player Pianoforte Manufacture.                         GENERAL REMARKS.  London is the centre of the Pianoforte Industry.  There are at present only a few manufacturing firms in the Provinces.  A large  part of theindustry is  carried on in modern factories under healthy  conditions^The processes are mostly different  forms of woodworking and give scoptPfor considerable skill.  With regard to Tuning and Repairing,  this branch  of the trade is widely distributed throughout the country, so that it may  be  possiblefor a disabled man after training to obtain employment near his home.  The trade has in the past  been  subject to seasonal fluctuations.  but with the increasing share of the world&apos;s trade which has  fallen to theBritish  manufacturer the fluctuations have decreased and  employmenttends to become regular.                     ANALYSIS OF PROCESSES.1. Saw Mills.........   Work in connection with Woodworking                                Machinery is not light and, as a rule,                                is suitable only for men with minor                                (I isablements.  Pull use of both hands                                is necessary.   On the lighter work                                one-legged men could be employed.2. Part  Making,   including   The warmth of  the  glue shop renders     Veneering.                 this process unsuitable for men with                                weakness  of heart or  lungs.   The                                operating of presses requires strength,                                and, on  the whole,  this process is                                chiefly  suitable for  men  suffering&apos;                                from  rheumatism  or  minor disabili-                                ties.    Loss of  leg  would  not dis-                                qualify nor the loss of fingers, pro-                                vided that the man  is able to grip                                with both hands.3. Back Making    ...     ...   This is  heavy work  and suitable only                                for men suffering from rheumatism                                or minor disabilities.    The loss of a                                leg would  not necessarily  disqualify                                nor the loss of fingers, provided  a                                sound   grip  with   one  hand   is                                possible.4. Bellying and Marking  off   The work is highly skilled.   The extent                                to which machinery is used varies in                                different  factories.   The  work  is                                fairly heavy.   Disabilities the same                                as in No. 2 above.5.

Though the work is quite suitable for         &apos;                       disabled  men,  the demand for this                                type of worker is limited.

The work is the lightest in  the factory and is mostly done sitting-  down.   The use of both arms, thumbs  and  fore fingers is essential.   It is  quite suitable for men suffering from  serious leg injuries,  also weakness of  heart and lungs.&apos; Sound hearing is  essential for the regulation  which  forms part of the process of Finish-  ing.The warmth  of   the  polishing, shop  renders the  process  unsuitable  for  men with heart weakness.  Injury to  one arm might not disqualify.  The  work is of  the  best type and  highly  skilled.This work is usually done in separate  factories  by  semi-automatic  ma-  chinery with female and boy labour.  In such cases the openings for men  are very limited.  The work is suit-  able for all kinds  of  disablements  provided that the man has use of  one  hand and good  eyesight.Skilled work.   The dust from the ivory  polishing  renders it unsuitable  for  men with  lung  weakness.   The loss  of a leg or an eye, deafness or other  minor   disabilities  would  not  dis-  qualify.A musical ear is  an essential qualifica-  tion and the use of both arms is neces-  sary.

This work is  lighter  in  the  case of                                 Gramophone making than in the case                                 of Piano  making.   Under  modem                                 conditions it should be readily learnt                                 by a man of ordinary skill.

This work is  heavy and  only a  very                                 short training is necessary; the heat                                 renders it   unsuitable for  cases of                                 weakness of heart or lungs.

Section III.  Organ Building.                         GENERAL REMARKS.   This branch  of the industry is  small, and only a limited number of vacancies are likely  to  be available.   There  are a number of  organbuilders  distributed throughout the country, with not more  than two orthree factories  in any one town outside London.                      ANALYSIS OF PROCESSES.   The work  is divided into  two categories, namely,  (1)k Woodworking,which  is highly skilled,  and (2) Metal-pipe making.  1.  Woodworking    ......  Pull use  of both hands is necessary, but                                 a minor injury to one  hand  would                                 not disqualify.

Some of the departments of tins work are well suited for disabled men,the work being light  and sedentary.    The industry,  which is highly skilled, is small, but  it is expected that there will be in the future a greater demand for British  made  instruments.                       ANALYSIS OF PROCESSES.  1. Piston or Valve Making ...  The full use of both hands is essential.                                 The loss of one leg or injuries to both                                 legs, the loss  of  an  eye, deafness,                                 weakness of lungs or heart would not                                 disqualify.  2.

Excepting  the making of high  class  violins on a very limited scale,the manufacture in this country of stringed instruments and other smallgoods  is in  its  infancy.    A high  degree  of skill in woodworking  isrequired.  The work being light and congenial, it is particularly suitablefor  disabled men.  There is a  general recognition of these facts in the trade and  the pro-posal  to train disabled men in this branch, which has influential tradesupport,  has  every prdspect  of succeeding.              Suitability of the Work for Disabled Men.  The use of  both hands is essential but minor injury to left hand wouldnot disqualify.  The loss of one leg or injury to both legs, loss of  aneye, partial deafness, weakness of  lungs or heart would not disqualify adisabled man for the work.  This branch of the Industry being in an experimental stage a definitescheme of training cannot be formulated.  The period of training should not be less  than 12 months, the first six  months of which should  be spent in a Technical School.

Where, however,  aLocal Technical  Advisory Committee has been  set  up for any industryin any area, it has been  decided by the Minister of Labour  that any dispute or difficulty with regard to the  wages to be paid to disabledsailors  and soldiers in that industry  and area  shall  he  referred to  theLocal Technical Advisory Committee.  It is  to be noted that these provisions will apply  not only to  men whoare being,  or have been, trained, but also to any men who are  being, or who propose to be,  employed in that particular industry  in the area inquestion.  .If the Local Technical Advisory Committee cannot  arrive ata  conclusion, the matter shall be referred to the National Trade  AdvisoryCommittee (Musical Instruments Trade).

      AUSTRALIA i_Bmploy-iient  of  the &apos;Pi gabled, &apos;k           Speaking yesterday  at  the Local  Government  Conference, Senator  ifallen  said that  the  Repatriation  Depart.-runt  wore dealing  with  incapacitated men in  four  classes,-           1.   The slightly incapacitated  man,  who was  unable to  earn  the full  wage  payable in the trade or occupation he followed before  trie war.   In that case the Department  undertook  to supplement his wages up to the full standard.           2.   Pion unaele to  follow their  old occupation.    In their case  vocational  training had  been  provi- ed.   The medical  profession had given its services gratuitously in  the determination of  such cases.    Vocational training  in  those cases has  a distinct economic value, since  it  &quot;rovides avenues of activity for men  who would otherwise bo  idle.           3,  The  still more  seriously  injured men, who could never hope  to  be a^le  to maintain themselves  by  their  own effort but who still possess some-working capacity.    Provision was  made  for those to  be employed in  national workshops, and  what working  capacity they had would be  employed to tho  fullest  possible extent.   If these men did  not work,  they would  have  to be paid for remaining idle. and that was good  for no one.    It was  infinitely better to  create workshops, even  if the men only  earned  bO% of what was  paid  to them. An  o.;essential condition in the establishment of  such industries was that they should not bring the returned men  into  competition  v with  existing industries.   After much  investigation  he had  sueseeded in  allocating three industries,  particulars of which  he would announce later.    he had decided to establish the workshops in open areas yet within reasonable touch of all that  a  civilised community could offer them.           4.   The permanently incapacitated.    For them, hostels would be established in the case of single men,  surrounded with every comfort.   In this connection the minister mentioned that it had been one of the cheering  aspects of  the work that tee number of totally  and permanently incapitated men would be infinitely  less than we.s anticipated in the early  stages of tho  war.   Additional provis&apos;.en&apos;would be made for men  requiring  convalescent care.                          K-^orve  dmploymont.           To provide for the  interval between the period at  which the men  desire employ --out and the finding  of it, reserve employment y.ould be provided.   Arrangements had been  made  with  two States to provide  for these  men in forestry.-   A.proposition would be  made through  the State  Governments to advance upon liberal and attractive terms sums of money to enable local governing bodies  to employ a percentage of returned soldiers  on their works.   Critics would do well to  remember,-  trie minister pointed  out, that the  controlling body in  the scheme  .:a-s a co mittee of business . .en and net a political body of  officials.                          Housinj? Scheme.           A housing scheme had. been decided upon, under which the soldier  would pay  rent as a tenant over a  period of years, a certain proportion of this  rent being credited to  interest and the balance set- off  against the  capital outlay.   If the soldier  proved  a reliableman, he  would nave the amount  set off  against capital credited to him and .,ould- be  able to complete  the purchase on the credit foneiorsystem.    If  not, then after the  probationary period,  and&quot;after paymentfgr rates and. damage, tho  balance set  off against capital would, bereturned  to hi..    Control of  this  scheme would  be put into the handsof an  independent authority.                               (i;.S.w . Daily Tele mm ph, )
[J, 3. A. i   The war Disabled and Industrial  Accidents,           at  a  conference held  at  Washington  in  July, 1918, bet/eon  the Federal  Board for Vocational education and representatives  of trie  State Compensation Co illusion and-&apos; Casualty Insurance Companies, it &apos;.;as  stated that one difficulty with - regard  to.employing handicappe;   men from the  employer-!s  and from the insurance point of view is their greater liability to injuries.   It was pointed out, however, that,  in  comparison  with the total number of such  men employed, the number of accidents is practically negligible,  and that from the ins.trance standpoint the  increased cost   of  compensation would be reflected  in  time in the raising of the general level of  insurance and  premiums.           several plans  nere suggested, by which the employers&apos; unwillingness to employ disabled men could be overcome.          One suggestion was that the Federal Government should be -responsible,  not only for injuries arising directly  from the war,  b.,t for all subsequent risl. which results  from  such injuries.   This plan would place a premium  upon the employment of these crippled  men and would have the further  advantage of nwu being&apos; dependent uoon State Compensation  La s.          The Now&apos;York  system was favourably mentioned. Under the Compensation Act of this State, the liability of an employer for a second major disabling injury is limited to the liability resulting from that injury, without  reference to any prior disability.   Compensation for the  remaining disability is paid out of a special fund, which is charged  to the industry as a whole.          It was also mentioned that in Pennsylvania before employers are granted/the  rivilege of carrying theirown risk under the Compensation Act, they are requiredto undertake not to discriminate against the employmentof cripples, foreigners, etc.
APPENDIX   XVII.PR A N C E :                 Employment of Ex-Soldiere.          A new law providing for the compulsory re-employment of-men in the posts they held before the war was published in the &quot;Journal Official1&apos; of 22nd  November,  1918.          The terms of the law are briefly     (1)  Government Departments, as well as private employers,are compelled to reinstate their employees who have beenserving in the Army, provided on the one hand that  the changesin economic conditions caused by the war make such  re-employmentpossible, and on the other, that the men are not so severelydisabled as to be unfit for their old posts.     (2)  Men who were engaged under contracts for  a definite period must be taken back to complete the term of their  *contract.  All contracts made with men in the absence  of thosewho have been called up, will expire automatically  as  soonas the latter ere re-employed.     (3)  Reinstated men will be eligible for any promotion,increase in salary or wages, or for any bonus provided forin the regulations existing before the war.   Where, owingte economic conditions or to a man&apos;s disablement, it isimpossible to reinstate him in his former posts,.a  similaror suitable one should, if possible, be given him.     (4)  Failing proof by the employer of the impossibility of reinstating his former employees, he will be liable for -damages according to the Labour Code .          An article in the &quot;Journal des Mutiles&quot; of 30thNovember, 1913, points out that; from the point of  view ofdisabled soldiers, who have in many cases taken the placeof men called up, this law is anything but satisfactory.These men are entirely at the mercy of their employers andmay be turned off at a moment&apos;s notice.  It  is claimed thatdischarged and  disabled soldiers should be  given preferencein employment before men who, though called  up, have beenearning money in safety in factories or other works.NOTE:-  The same complaint comes  from Germany where  employers        are alleged to be discharging disabled men to make        room for former employees..   Firms employed on        Government work are forbidden to discharge such        disabled men unless the latter have been provided        with another job.
f                                 I T A L Y          Further provision for the orphans and parents ofsoldiers Killed in the war and for aegis atlee soldiers.          The &quot;Bollettino dells Federasione hazionale&quot; (TAOV .1918)gives a summary of a decree, recently issued, making provisionfor the orphans and parents of solders Killed in the war before 1st January, 1918, and for all soldiers ?/ho were mutilated ordisabled in the present war before that date.  (Soldiers killedor disabled since 1st January, 1910 come under the free insurancescheme, which was established by a decree cf 10th December, 1917).          Under the present scheme the national InsuranceInstitution is authorised to issue a free policy for each orphanunder age (legitimate or illegitimate) of men and non-commissioned officers of the army, of &quot;complementary officers&quot;, of theterritorial militia and of complementary and reserve officers ofthe navy, who have teen killed while fighting prior to 1stJanuary, 1918, or who have died since that date as a result ofwounds previously received.          The capital assured by the policy is 500 lire for theorphan of a private or H.C.O., ana 1000 lire for an officersorphan.  It is payable &quot;when the orphan comes of ago, or beforeif the orphan is a girl and marries, or it may be converted into an annuity for education to begin when the orphan is 10 years old .          The National Insurance Institution Is also authorisedto supplement on favourable terms such annuities for educationfrom contributions made by the provinces, communes, benevolentinstitutions, etc,          where the soldier leaves no orphans under age hisparents will receive the benefit&apos; ef the policy, v;hen - the fatheris 65 years of age, or, if he is dead, when the mother is CO,provided they are not already in receipt of a pension of atleast 2000 lire from any public funds, and. do not pay taxes ona taxalle income of mere than 500 lire.          The capital assured by the c 1 sab lee. solders&apos; policyis looO lire for privates and N7.C.0&apos;s, and 1500 lire for officers, and may be converted into an annuity payable inadvance.  This capital and the corresponding annuity may,  atany time, be increased on specially favourable terms by paymentsmace by the insured person.          The national Insurance Institution is also authorisedto issue to the disabled- soldiers concerned a. policy for theamount mentioned above, to tame effect from 1st January 1910payable in 30 years to the insured person if he is then dive,or if not,  to the done  and children, or failing then, to the parents.

In the great struggle which now  seems  drawing to a  close,  men and women- combatants/ and nonscombatants have been heartened by the loving  and sympathetic labour of those who devote themselves to the care of the  dependents of our glorious Dead, and to the promotion of the welfare of the suffering.       On behalf of all ranks of the British  Armies in France,  Belgium, and Germany, I send New Year Greetings to all who are giving their energies so unselfishly to these tasks and trust that our heartfelt gratitude will  be some small recompense for their successful efforts.Appendix xviii,174
258TEE  WAE PENSIONS GAZETTE.JANUARY, 1919. that show what men are,&quot;  How many promising careers have been spoiled by ease and prosperity. How often have physical disabilities or the sharp and sudden  blow of adversity stimulated unexpired- pected capacities  which might  otherwise  have remained  for ever dormant.   This is the dominant note struck in one article after another.  In one, for example, illustrations by Vierge, the great draughtsman and illustrator of Don Quixote, are given to  show the work he did with his right hand before  he  was deprived of its use by a stroke of paralysis, and his later and greater work with  the  left hand which  he set himself at once to educate.   Another article gives the story  of an American Bank  President who started out on his life career minus  both legs, his left arm, and the ringers of his  right  hand.  Asked  how  much  he thought such physical disability interfered with a man&apos;s earning capacity, his answer  was characteristic &quot; From his neck down a man is worth about $1.50 a day, from bis neck up he may be worth $100,000 a year.&quot;   The  story  of  those who in a greater or lesser degree have &quot; battled with fate and won through,&quot; is fascinating in itself and of very practical use in helping others.   Ail  education  is  a process   of  suggestion  or imitation, and one living  example is worth a ton of,&apos;exhortatory literature.   Why has St.  Dunstans been such  a glorious success.  Surely  because  every  blinded  soldier knows   that in Sir Arthur  Pearson he  has  this living example of one who has not only refused to accept   defeat, but  rather &quot;  breasting the blows of circumstance&quot; with added energy has  turned his life, forgetful of self, to other and even greater forms  of usefulness.  As we travel back through history many such great examples must occur to us.  We have spoken of Vierge.  Cervantes himself,, wbose masterpiece Don Quixote he illustrated, was a disabled soldier, and  a   very  gallant  gentleman.  At the  battle of Lepanto when the fleet came into action, Cer- suinvantes  lay  below sick, but insisted on taking his share in the fighting. He received three wounds, one of  which permanently maimed his right band. His life thereafter is a record of strenuous  and unceasing labour unrewarded,  spent  in extreme poverty in  mean lodgings and even in jail  where Don Quixote  was actually written. He worked until the very end.   It was after he had received  extreme unction, and two days  before his death,  that he wrote the dedication  of  Persiles y Sigismunda,  &quot; the most moving and gallant of farewells.&quot;  Homer and Milton were both blind;  so  wasHuber,  the Swiss  naturalist;   Beethoven  was deaf;  Mozart composed his great  operas and his &quot; Bequiem&quot;  oppressed  by  debt and  struggling with a fatal disease. &quot; But for suffering the bes part of many a man&apos;s nature would never awake, Shelley said of poets:  &quot; They learn in suffering what they  teach in song.&quot;   &quot;If I had not been so great an invalid,&quot; st Darwin, &quot; I should not have done nearly so mucl work as I have been able to accomplish.&quot;   Helen Keller, deprived of sight, smell, and hear ing  when barely two years old, learned several languages, took a mathematical degree, and wrote books which in literary style and outlook on lift will  probably  remain the  most  extraordinary revelation of  what is  possible  to one so heavilj handicapped.   Henry  Fawcett is  another example.  He had just left  Cambridge  and  entered  Lincoln&apos;s Inn when his propects  were  apparently shattered hy a shooting  accident,  two  stray  shot  from  his father&apos;s gun blinding him for life.   Within ten minutes after his accident he had made up  his mind to &quot; stick to  Ms old pursuits as  much  as  possible.&quot;  He continued  to ride, row, fish, and skate;  specialised in economics; and was elected to the Chair of  Political Economy at Cambridge.  He entered the  House  of  Com- mons, and later as Postmaster-General was respon- sible for  many of the greatest  reforms in the postal service.   Talleyrand  diverted  from the army  by  his lameness,  became the greatest  diplomatist of his age. .  When his  son  expressed a desire  to  enter the  army,  Sir  Walter  Scott wrote  to  Southej &quot; I have no  title to combat a choice which would have been  my  own had  not my lameness  pre- vented.&quot;  So, had Scott not injured his  foot as a child, lie might have  fought all through the Peninsular war and  bad  his  breast  covered with  medals, but there would have been no Waverley Novels.  Of making such a  list there is  no  end, and amongst the thousands of  disabled in this  great war  there will be, in fact there are already many names  to  add.  What I have  tried to say may be summed upin a few lines. by a great  but little read  poet,Samuel  Daniel. &quot; Not to be  unhappy is unhappinesse  And misery not tfhave known iniserie ;  For the best way unto discretion is  The way that leads us by adversitie ;  And men are better shewed what is amisse  By th&apos;expert finger of calamitie,  Than  they can be with all that fortune brings,  Who never shewes them the true face of things.&quot;                                  THE EDITOE.

Such an article might well                 be followed  by one  giving similar instances of men disabled in the present war who have risen superior to  their handicaps and are commanding success in a new career.  These examples would be of even greater value as object lessons to those for whom we are working,  and they must already be numerous. Can any of our readers supply us with particulars of individual cases ?                     -o--   In the same article  attention is drawn  to the new magazine Carry On, edited by the Office of the Surgeon-                 General  U.S.  Army,  311,  Fourth   Another&apos; New  Avenue, New York,  and  published     Magazine.   by tho American  Red  Cross.  It  is                 printed on excellent paper, beautifully illustrated, and to those interested it is supplied for one year free of charge.   Such a publication may well excite the  envy of less happier lands cribbed and confined by Paper Controllers. Three numbers have  already  appeared, and amongst its  contributors  are President Wilson,  Mr.  Theodore Roosevelt, Mr. Gelett Burgess, Mr. Charles Schwab, and many other notable names.                      -o------   On Friday, November 29th, a service of thanksgiving and  dedication to  future work for all London  War                 Pensions&apos;   Committee  workers,  was  A  Thanksgiving held  at  St.  Martms-in-the-Fields.

He  urged all workers to remain  at  their  posts.  &quot; Upon  our loyal, enthusiastic,  determined sympathetic   persistence  in the work,&quot; he said, &quot; will  depend,  perhaps  in  greater measure than we know, the future happiness and unity of our  land.

So  lately as December 9th the  answer in the  coluums of a London  Daily  Newspaper  statedwrongly  that  to obtain the allowance the applicantmust prove that she was unable to earn.  In certain cases  which have  been brought  to  ournotice  the applicant  was working in the shop of  arelative,  and information has  been refused as  to  thenature and amount of the  remuneration received.   Insuch cases Local Committees are perfectly justified inwithholding the  allowance until any information re-quired by them has been furnished.                     - o-  The  Bradford  Dyers&apos;  Association, Limited, whichemploys  thousands of hands  in Yorkshire  and Lan-                 cashire, announces that it has handed    Generous     over to  trustees  180,000  for  the  Treatment of  benefit of its  men in  the  fighting     Former     forces.  The Association  states,  in    Employees.    a message to the men, that its first                 duty will  be to ensure  employment for  them on their return,.  To show its gratitude in atangible  way, it desires to  give the men a pecuniaryinterest in the  business.  The scheme affects men whowere in the Association^ employment on the outbreakof war, and who joined the Forces  before the end of1917.  The trustees  will divide  the  money  on  thefollowing lines :     (A) Shares  in  Bradford  Dyers&apos; Association   for         those  able to return to their employment the         shares to carry special yearly bonus, in addition         to usual dividend.

Their object was to consider and report on the best method of fostering the spirit  of  comradeship and mutual help among all who have served and are serving in  the  Forces.  A  con- consultative committee has been formed with-General Sir Ian Hamilton as Chairman, consisting of equal numbers of  officers and other ranks, past or present, with three women&apos;s representatives of the Royal Navy, the Army, and the Royal Air  Force.  The  Committee will  take evidence from existing organizations working on behalf of  those who  have served or are serving,  will collect facts concerning them, and will report on the best method whereby the  exisitng  effort  may be  utilized or co- ordinated to  secure the spirit in view.  Another com- mittee,  under  Admiral Lord Jellicoe, is to- consider tho promotion of  comradeship throughout  the  Empire among all who have served in the present war.

We have been asked by the Secretary of the north wales Joint Committee to insert the following resolution adopted by them at a recent meeting :  &quot; That the North Wales Joint  (Disablement)  Com-mittee urgently represents to all  Local Authorities in north Wales that  it is not a sufficient recognition ofthe Nation&apos;s debt to those men  who have suffered in health and limb in the service of their Country, merely to give them the preference, all other things being equalin making appointments, but  that discharged and  dis-abled soldiers should receive public posts in preference to other applicants, provided the  soldier has  sufficientqualifications to enable him  to  discharge  his duties with reasonable efficiency.&quot;                     France.                     -o-     RESULTS OF AGRICULTURAL RE-EDUCATION,                     -o-&apos;  Medicin-Major Chatin, of the Re-education CentreLyons, in the course of a recent address given beforeAcademy of Agriculture, gave some interesting partieslars as to the results of the  agricultural re-educatioicarried on at the centre.  As the result of enquiry with regard to men with aiamputated lower limb, it was found that the majority!of those who had formerly worked on the land went bacito it, in spite of their severe handicap.  A wooden log is the most suitable apparatus for woron the land, the lightest and most perfectly jointed le;being of no use  for this purpose; the wooden leg wit]advantage being fitted with a broad cross-piece at tinbottom to facilitate walking on ploughed  land.  Buiwhatever  apparatus is used, it  is a painful effort foimen wearing an artificial limb to bend the body, as they]must when working in the fields.  Scything is very  hard for them, and in sloping fields!almost impossible,  because of the forward step, whichmust be taken with the sound leg, in order to keep pace)with the  work.   Attempts  have been  made to makithe work easier  either  by the use  of  a long-handled!double curved scythe in the form of an S, which in somecases allows of the  body being held almost erect, or bythe use of a  left-handed scythe for men with the rightleg amputated ;  but it is by no means easy to persuade&apos;the men to adopt this change of position.  In ploughing the chief difficulty  is the walking  ovetjploughed  land with a wooden leg. This difficulty is!overcome by the use of Canadian ploughs with a seatit is lessened by the use of the Brabant plough, but isconsiderable  with the Doinbasle plough where the manhas lost  his  right leg as he  must then walk with liiiwooden leg in the furrow and his sound  leg half bent onthe ploughed land.   If the man has lost his left leg, oiworse still, his left thigh, the work is almost impossibleIt would be  best in these cases to have a plough  withthe plough-share reversed.  Agricultural  work  seems  less  difficult, generallyspeaking for men with an arm amputated, even if onlya very short stump is left, than for those who have losta leg.  Work is made possible by simple and  solidprotheses, the aluminium working arm of Gillet, and thespecial apparatus for holding tools of Jullien.  The toolholding apparatus with a revolving ring, fastened to theworking  arm by a shaft of  sufficient  length, with an anti-vibratory  spring  inserted, is  most  useful.   Forploughing a  team of oxen  is  preferable, on account ofits slowness and regularity, to a team of horses.  Digging, whether with spade or fork, is one of thebest training exercises for men with an amputated ariaThe apparatus with a  &quot; cardan &quot;  is better than thatwith a revolving ring for this purpose.   Men who  have!lost the right arm soon get used to a left-handed scytlicj  All agriculturists re-educated at Lyons learn to doilittle carpentering jobs useful for the repair of agricul;tural tools.  Thanks to the  &quot; Lumiere &quot;  pincers  each!one is soon able to saw, nail, plane, use the jointing plane,and the  file to  sharpen his  saw ; he is also taught tohollow out a mortise and make an adjustment.  The kitchen garden of hospital 40,  containing 7,square metres of ground,  has been cleared, ploughed,!dug and sowed exclusively by the amputated men attend-j.ing the centre.

176(( JANUARY, 1919.                 THE WAR PENSIONS  GAZETTE.                         261 The  aftercare  of  the Tuberculous                    Soldier.                     -. o-Jlfc would appear from certain instances  of men whohave consulted their  Local  War  Pensions Committeesuffering from tuberculosis, especially that form whichattacks  the lungs, that  the  procedure  that should  beadopted in their cases is not always clearly known tothe staff of the Committee.   It is  for this reason that Ishould  like to indicate briefly the steps which shouldbe taken to secure treatment, and  to give some elemen-tary  suggestions  as  tfo  the  hygiene,  that should  beadopted by tho man himself, and  those connected  withldm.  &apos;  It should be borne in mind that under the  national health  Insurance Act of 1911,  the National HealthInsurance  Commissioners  were made  the  responsiblebody for the provision of treatment for insured persons(Sanatorium,  Domiciliary, Dispensary, Panel  Doctor,as the  case rna,y  be)  through  their Local Committeessubject to the recommendation of their medical advisers.Under  the National  Health Insurance Act  of  1917medical and sanatorium benefits are extended to everyinvalided soldier or sailor whose total income is under 160 a year.  All  cases of tuberculous ex-service  men that cometo the notice of the Local War Pensions Committee forthe first time should&apos; be referred  without delay to theInsurance  Committee, and the  opinion of their medicaladviser  should  be acted upon up to the hilt.  Theimportance of  the  early treatment   of  tuberculosiscannot  be  too much insisted  upon, and  every effort should  be  made  by the Local Committee  to  persuade the patient to lose no time in carrying out the necessarytreatment  and to take the precautions necessary for hisown and others safety.  Then  conies the question  of allowances due to theman while  undergoing treatment.  In  all  cases wherethe man has been invalided suffering from tuberculosiscertified to be either aggravated by or attributable to service and awarded a pension under Article 7 (1) of theRoyal Warrant that man is entitled to the full allowancesunder the instructions governing treatment whether heis in an institution or undergoing treatment at home,provided always that  this treatment is such as is recom-mended by either a Medical Board  or the  MedicalAdviser  to the Insurance Committee.  There is  alsothe man who is  discharged from the service underArticle  7 (2)  who is  entitled to allowances under theinstructions governing treatment in respect of his  wife and family or dependants, if any, only during such  time as he is receiving treatment in an institution.  He is not entitled to allowances during such time as  he is under-going  treatment at home&apos;.  Recently  the  Minister ofPensions has  sanctioned the payment of an allowanceup to 10s. a week for the provision of extra nourishmentin cases of severe illness.  This allowance  can only be sanctioned by the Committee on medical recommenda-tion.  In all cases other than tuberculosis the MedicalReferee  makes the  recommendation,  but again  theCommittee must remember that in cases of tuberculosisthe recommendation  for  this extra nourishment mustbe made by the Tuberculosis  Officer.  Each  Local Committee is  notified by the InsuranceCommittee of a  man&apos;s  admission to a sanatorium.During his stay in the sanatorium the man is taught a rule of life which it will be  to his interest to continueafter his discharge and in order that he may be helpedand not hindered in his efforts.  The opportunity of his absence  should be taken to educate the whole family inthe essential  and urgent need of a high  standard ofhygiene and living generally, and  to see that as far aspossible the conditions both at home and at work towhich he returns are  such as will help and not hinderhis complete recovery.  The Tuberculosis Officer will, in the majority of cases,advise  each mart to keep under his regular supervisionat the  tuberculosis dispensary after leaving the sana-sanatorium, and the Local Committee should endeavour tosee that this is carried out.  The conditions at homeand at work to which  the man returns are of paramount importance if his continued progress towards health isto be maintained and if he is to be no source of dangereither to his relatives or workmates.  As regards the hygiene of the home every man shouldhave a room to himself to sleep in,  failing this at leasthe must have a bed to himself.-  The room should containas little unnecessary  furniture  as  possible.   Carpets,stuffed  chairs, trimmings, hangings, in fact all things that collect dust should be removed, while the importanceof open windows is too well-known to need comment.Immediately  a man gets up in the morning  the  bedshould  be  stripped of every article of clothing and themattress turned and left to air for  at least two hours.The room should be scrubbed once a week at least witha solution  of carbolic acid.  All utensils used by theman should be  scoured  through daily with the samesolution, and the most minute detailed care should bepaid to  the sanitary arrangements of the  home.  Mealsshould  be taken at regular intervals and  should consistof a good  plain nourishing  diet.  All fatigue should be avoided, and if possible nine hours sleep at least shouldbe the rule.  Crowded places of amusement should be avoided.  Smoking should  be in the strictest  modera-tion, a pipe being preferable to cigarettes ; while alcoholshould be entirely foresworn.  Then one has to  consider the suitability of work.Should a man&apos;s former occupation be one that  does notentail excessive manual  labour, there is no  objectionto his resuming the same, more especially if his employercan be  prevailed upon to transfer him from a town to a country branch or in  some way to make  it possible  forthe man to carry on his work under favourable hygienicconditions.   Even the occupation of a clerk would not,I think, be objected to, provided the above conditions were complied  with.   It is invaluable, from the pointof view of  advising the man as to his future work, to consult  wherever possible with the Tuberculosis Officer,and in this connection Local Committees should know that they can make a grant towards the expenses of theman&apos;s removal if this is recommended.                       M. COTTON-STAPLETON.                 Pensions Bonus.                     -o--  In consideration of the high cost of living it has beendecided by the War Cabinet that the period from  1stNovember, 1913, to 30th June, 1919, a war bonus of20 per cent, shall be added to the ordinary war pensionsgranted for disablement or death  due to war service ofdisabled men and their children  and the widows andchildren of deceased men.  The increase will apply to treatment and  trainingallowances for families, and also to those for men thern-selves, except men in institutions who pay only the nominal sum of 7s. a week for their maintenance.   Withcertain restrictions it  will also apply to dependents&apos;pensions.  The bonus will not apply to  alternative pensions ;but a widow may be allowed to draw ordinary pension and allowances for her children, if and while the bonusmakes the total higher than the amount of alternative pension.  Detailed regulations will be published shortly.   Appli-cation to the Ministry of Pensions is not necessary.

They proved v.ery  competent bodies and would havethe advantage  of being able to obtain local  evidencewhen required without much expense.                 I am, yours  truly,                       W. MAITLAN D^HERIOT,                                         Chairman.County Buildings, Dumfries.       Dunifrieshires Local Committee.             Training  Opportunities.                     .-o--  Special  arrangements have recently  been made forthe training in Contract Tailoring for a number of mendisabled by leg amputation or lameness, or, in certain cases, by the loss of an arm with Messrs. Lotery Bros.,4, St. Mary Street, Whitechapel, a firm who undertakelarge contracts for all classes of uniforms and liveries.  The&apos;course will consist of three months&apos; training withmaintenance allowance,  after  which employment  atthe current rate of pay is guaranteed to men who  have become efficient.  With a view to encouraging the mento take full advantage of the instruction offered, Messrs.Lotery will pay a bonus after the first month to thosewho show  progress  and prove  themselves capable.An experiment  in this direction with a limited numberof men has already been made with the excellent resultthat it has been found possible for such men to  earnreadily between  4 to  5 a -week.  A hostel has been  provided  for the accommodation of the men at which they will be asked to pay 17s. (id.a week.  Should  the  actual  expenses exceed this sum, thedifference will be paid by the London Local Committeein  terms  of Circular 90.   Application on behalf of candidates  considered  suitable should be addressedto the Secretary, London War Pensions Committee.

Pension  Pictures.         .-o-.No. 2. MRS. LOVELL-YATES.  It took  me some time  to  get  accustomed  to  tl&quot; Unmarried Wife,&quot; and we were often confronted wiufthis paradox in the office.  I hope that my standard of respectability is still high ;but to know  all is to forgive if not all-a good deal,and many of the women with whom we had to do, wereloyal and faithful partners to the men of their choice.  Mrs. Lovell-Yates&apos;s story was romantic.  Years ago,she, and a small girl Mend, used to go to school andplay there with two little  boys.  She  says  that  theembryo Lovell was always her sweetheart, and that herfriend loved young Yates.  Unfortunately, when they grew up, the wrong couplesgot married and sorted themselves out afterwards totheir own  satisfaction ;  but not  strictly in accordancewith the law of the land.  Now  both  the heroes of  the story are dead, and  inthe touching old words, &quot; Their  love and their hatredand their envy is now perished, neither have they anymore a  portion for ever in anything that is done underthe sun.&quot;   Yates died for his country in Prance, and toa woman the office staff fought for Mrs. Lovell-Yates&apos;pension.  We were naturally &quot; out&quot; on  her behalf as we werenot so intimate with  the other side of the story.  Our  path was beset with thorns, the  principal  one was the fact that Yates,  who must have been of  anaffectionate disposition,  insisted on going to say good-bye to  his original and legal wife before  returning toFrance for  the last time.  Lovell  was now dead.  After weeks of hard work Mrs. Lovell-Yates got herpension, but the eldest child had no claim on her country as she  was born before matrimonial  re-arrangements,and her father was a civilian.  Carrie Lovell  used to interest me very much when she came sometimes to the office for her mother&apos;s money.  She was a tall slip of a girl about  13 and painfullynervous.  She would flush to the roots of her &quot; bobbed &quot;hair when  spoken to, and looked as if she would like tokick up her heels and run away with the untrammelledgrace of a young animal.  I used to see  the  child  in the road sometimes nearher tiny home and  surrounded  by small unruly half-brothers and sisters ; but she was difficult to approach,and I am afraid I did not persevere.  On returning to. the office, after some weeks absence,I heard that the girl was ill, and that there  was a fearof  consumption.  Then I decided to concentrate  onCarrie.  How touchingly easy it  is to  win the love and confidence of children!  A few cheap  books,  an  oddhalf hour,  to teach them how to  turn the heel of a sockor show them some bit of needlework, and they are yourwarm friends.  A friend for life at the price of sixpence,or half-an-hour!  Perhaps the book may  be ninepencenow,  and  the half-hour might  be  reckoned as three-quarters, compared with its pre-war equivalent;  but thesmall outlay is well worth while.  Poor little  Carrie,she has been to several London hospitals for advice, andis now waiting for  the final verdict.  If she can be certified as quite safe to be  with other children she will go to a charming little home kept by a friend of one of the  pension ladies, where she will have every care and be  trained to go into service when she is strong  enough.  If this is not considered advisable atpresent, she  will be sent to a good sanatorium, where we hope that any latent  delicacy may be successfullycombated, and that she may eventually join the bandof  young  girls  who are  now doing  well, and whosemistresses, on the  whole,  are  very  grateful  to  this branch of war pension activity.

Overseas and  Foreign  Pension Notes.                     --0---  Canada. Soldiers  searching  for land are permitted to travel at a reduced rate on the main railways.  For  the  supply  of  artificial  limbs  and   surgicalappliances  in Canada the  Department of Soldiers CivilRe-Establishment  has  created an   Orthopaedic  andSurgical  Appliances Branch at  Toronto.   The limbsare built by the Government and are highly standardizedso&apos;as to  permit of variations to meet particular caseswithout the necessity of  making  specially  every  partof the artificial leg or arm in  other words those partsare standardised which are common to all artificial armsand legs.   This gives increased  speed in the productionof artificial limbs, reduces  to a minimum the amount ofmoney invested in repair parts  to be kept in stock andreduces the cost.  A man returning from overseas who needs an applianceis sent, whilst still undischarged, to the Central Branchat Toronto, where  he is measured by limb fitters for thenecessary  appliance. On  his  first  measurement  theman is assigned an order  number  which is stamped onhis  appliance, and all subsequent  renewals and repairsare given that number  together with an  indication ofthe renewal or repair made.  Production orders, labourand material tickets, etc., are similarly numbered, andby assembling these and adding a percentage for over-head charges, actual cost is obtained.  On the  certificate of the Medical Officer that  theappliance is satisfactory the man is discharged, whenhe comes under the Department  of  the Soldiers CivilRe-Establishment.   New  appliances or   repairs  areobtainable on application to the Medical Director of thedepartment in the man&apos;s  home district with whom allthe papers in the case  are filed.  The  organisation is completed  by the establishment of fitting and repairingshops, controlled from Toronto, in the principal centres of the Dominion.  There are, or will be shortly, ten ofthese centres.  The above arrangements apply to Imperial pensioners and members of the Allied Forces who settle in  Canada.  France. A Bill, having for  its object the provisionof loans  for disabled and  discharged soldiers to enablethem to set  up in small  businesses of their own, was introduced in the  Chamber in January, 1918.  The Bill proposes that co-operative  credit  societiesshould be formed to grant loans or credit to co-operativegroups of disabled  soldiers or to members of such groups,The loans  should not exceed, as a rule, the equivalent of two years&apos; pension and should be repaid within fouryears, but in certain circumstances  the amount mightbe increased and the period extended.  Another proposal in  the Bill is that the &quot;  banquespopulaires&quot;  should be enabled  to  grant  loans at a reduced rate to disabled men who carry on a business.  In presenting this Bill  the  promoters urged that inmany instances a  small capital is absolutely necessaryto enable  a  man  to resume  his  former  employment.With an extended  utilization of electricity in the future,it will be  possible for village  industries to be revivedthroughout the  country.   Co-operative  societies,  es-specially in connection with the schools of re-education.should be formed  to safeguard the interests of  disabledmen who engage in these revived industries.   In thesecircumstances  the  proposals  in  the Bill would  beinvaluable.  In consequence  of  lack   of  accommodation   in military hospitals  soldiers mentally affected  are sentto  civilian asylums, where, owing  to  the formalitiesconnected with discharge papers, they may be detained,for a year or even two years,  before they can be  dis-charged.   In these circumstances it is being urged either that all  mentally  affected men.should be cared for inicoi;Lve&apos;military  hospitals, or  that  the  Civilian authority should be allowed to carrytout all the formalities requtparifor discharge.

Some of the sum had been disbursed ifchrProvincial  War  Pension Committees,  some thro&apos;&apos;National institutions,  some had been granted to  orphhomes, and about  12,500 had gone towards sendilchildren into the country or to the seaside.

South Africa. The Governor-Generafs Fund, startin  September,. 1914, gives benefits very similar to oiformer Statutory Committee, and also takes, the platof the newly initiated King&apos;s Fund.   Up to.April, 19l!the fund amounted to  1,750,000.  Of this sum neail 175,000 had been distributed in relief and  10,500 speion  training disabled men.  Germany. By a Law of 2(5th July, 1918, the advaitages  of the &quot; Law relating to the Provision ofCapital&quot; of the 3rd July, 1910, were extended to offioand to officers&apos; widows.  The provisions of the new Law are similar to tincontained  in  the Law  relating to  non-commissionfofficers and men.   They are based on the same fund!mental principle, viz., that the capital advanced mayinvested only in land to be used for industrial or agrictural  purposes,  such land - to be acquired  throughpublic utility building or settlement society.  The capital is not advanced upon the pension bdepends upon the surrender of the supplementary wallowances for a period of ten years.  The sum advancimay not exceed eight times the amount due annually iflhirespect of such allowances.

Some municipalities jjjfurther and bring up  the man&apos;s  wages to his pre-waiiincome, whilst others  take a lower  view and in fixing the man&apos;s wages take his pension into account.

Already several businesseshave been started.  m      Pensions  in  Parliament;                      -o-              Young Soldiers (Education),   Mr. Gulland  asked the Under-Secretary of State for War whether he will issue orders that these young men who are serving in the Army and  Officers&apos; Training Corps and desire  to attend the universities or  other educational  institutions should bo  forthwith  released iio that they may resume their studies after Christmas ?   Mr. Macpherson:  It has been arranged that officers and  men whose education  has been  interrupted by military service, and who wish to resume their studies, will be  treated  on the same basis as those men who have definite employment awaiting them, and they will be granted early release within the  period  of  general dispersal.  I  am unable to  make any statement  as to when this release will take effect.        South African Soldiers  (Pensions, Etc.).   Colonel  W.  Thorne  asked  the  Pensions  Minister whether those South African citizens who came to this country in the  early days  of  the War  at  their  own expense and enlisted and who, after being disabled, are returning to  South Africa, are awarded pensions at the British rates, being regarded as British soldiers, instead of being  given pensions at the higher South African rates ;  whether South African widows, whose husbands displayed similar patriotism and were killed, are granted pensions at British rates, with a supplementation  from the  Governor-General&apos;s fund ;   and  whether  he  will take such steps  as will ensure  that  pensions  in  such cases shall be paid on  the  basis of the  higher South African scales, without charitable additions ?   Sir  A.  Griffith-Boscawen:   In the  case  of South Africans enlisting in British units and their dependants, pensions can only  be  paid by the British Government at  the rates allowed  by  the  Royal Warrant.   The question of supplementing these rates is  a matter for the  South African Government, but-1  am informed that a disabled South African who enlisted in a British unit can be  granted  a supplementary  pension which will put him on  the same footing as if he had enlisted in South Africa.                  Widows Pensions.   Colonel Asldey asked  the  Pensions Minister whether he will consider a  modification to  Article 19  of the Royal Warrant of 1918 or, alternatively, a modification of the regulations  of  the  special grants committee so that the large number  of war widows  who  had  been deserted by their husbands  prior to the  enlistment of the latter may be awarded pensions, in view of the fact that if these men had not joined the Service they would have been compelled by the civil authorities to maintain their wives and families who are now deprived by the State of their means of support ?  Sir A.  Griffith-Boscawen :  If the widow had obtained a  maintenance order  against her  husband a pension, with children&apos;s allowances, can be granted  under Article 19 of the Royal Warrant.   If she had not obtained an order,  and was not being supported  by the soldier, no pension can be given,  but the special grants committee will  give a special allowance under  their regulations where  the failure to obtain a maintenance order  was not due to the woman&apos;s own default  or negligence. In this  manner  the  genuinely  deserving cases  are  met, and I do not consider that an amendment of the warrantor regulations is necessary.                 Soldier Apprentices.  Mr.  Brookes asked the Minister of Reconstructionif he can make any definite statement as to the position and treatment after the War of soldier apprentices who volunteered in the early stages  of the contest, who gave tip their trade for a time, and who are now twenty-two or  twenty-three years of age ?   Dr. Addison :  As I stated in the House, the Govern- ment has agreed to a scheme which makes provision for apprentices whose term of training has been interrupted by war service.  The Ministry of Labour is in negotiation with some  of the  employers&apos; and workpeople&apos;s organ- isations concerned, and it is hoped that they will be in a position to introduce a Bill early next Session.               Pensions Administration.   Sir  Montague Barlow  (by Private Notice)  asked the Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer whether  the Resolution of the Parliamentary Pensions  Bureau,  signed  by over 300 Members of the House, in  reference to the setting up of a Select Committee&quot; of all  parties to  deal  with pensions, has been considered by the Government,  and whether he  can state what action it is proposed to take ?   Mr. Bonar Law :  The Government  realise  the im- portance of this subject, and if  this Government should be  returned to power they i^ropose to set up a Select Committee  to examine in what way the administration of  the Pensions Act can best be  administered  and grievances  removed.                    Training.  Colonel Ashley asked the  Pensions Minister whether he  will consider the issue of a  definite  order directing Local War Pensions Committees to pay the bonus  due to a discharged man on completion of a course of training without any delay in cases  where the committees areunable to find  employment  for  him, and where his pension is insufficient to support him ?  Sir  A.  Griffith-Boscawen:   Local  War  Pensions Committees have already been given definite instructionsto pay the bonus in all cases immediately &quot;on the com-pletion of the  course.   I am  sending the  lion,  andgallant Member a copy of the Instructions.

Circular 125.-Army and  Air Force.  New System of Discharge and Payment of TemporaryAllowances.  The system under whicira soldierV, or airman&apos;s discharge took effect 21 days after it hadjbecn decided to invalid him has beendiscontinued, and discharge is now carried out from the day onwhich tho soldier or airman is discharged from the discharge centreor the hospital to his home.  Each man will receive a book of four coupons which will bo paidweekly at any Post Office on production by the man of his Identityand  Provisional  Protection Certificate.  This Certificate bearsfour ring spaces which will be stamped by the Post Office whenpayment of the respective coupons is obtained.  The first couponwill be payable on tho date following that of  his discharge,  andsubsequently every sevonth day.,  Tho  first two coupons will beat the rate of 27s. 6d., and the remaining two for 27s. Cd. pluschildren&apos;s allowances where separation allowances has been issued.The allowances for children will he : For one child, 6s.  8d.;  Fora second child, 5s.  For each child after tho second, 4s. 2d.   Thofirst two coupons do not include children&apos;s allowances as paymentof Separation Allowances will continue for at least a fortnightafter tlte date of the man&apos;s discharge. &apos;  A similar procedure will be adopted in regard to men transferredto Class P or P (T) of tho Reserve.  In the case of  Seamen and Marines the existing arrangementsfor discharge will continue, except that the period before dischargetakes effect will be extended to  28  days (instead  of 21  days asformerly) after the  decision to invalid  tho man.   Durink  thisperiod the man will receive his pay and allotment, and separationallowance will bo continued in respect of him.  No advances by Local Committees should in future be necessaryin any cases of men awaiting settlement of their claim to pension.  If any men complain that they have not been furnished with abook of temporary allowance forms on  discharge, they  should bereferred to the  Officer-in-Charge of the  hospital,  or tho officercommanding tho discharge centre from which they were discharged,as the issue of these books is not controlled by tho Ministry.  As  regards soldiers transferred to Classes W or W (T) of thoReserve no transfer will bo carried out by  the Military authorities under the revised procedure unless  the following  conditions are fulfilled :-    (a) Tho man is willing to go.    (&amp;) Has not been impaired in health  since his entry  into tho        Army.    (c) Has definite employment in civil life awaiting him.  Army pay and ration allowance will be  continued ordinarily for7 days after the  date  of approval of transfer from the Army to civil life, but in cases of substitution the  continuamce will be for14 days.  These arrangements also should render unnecessary any advancesby Local Committees on behalf of tho War Office to Class W menunder the Statutory Committee Circulars 31 and 53 and the MinistryCircular 24.Nov.  15TH. &apos; CIRCULAR  126. Alternative Pensions.  A widow may be granted an alternative pension if she can showthat her widow&apos;s pension, together with allowances for her children,is less than two-thirds of the alternative pension which could havebeen awarded to her husband had ho survived and been incapable of supplementing that pension  by earnings.  Tho disablementpension to a totally disabled man of the.rank of Private is 27s. 6d. aweek and an alternative pension cannot,  therefore, be granted toa disabled man whose pre-war earnings did not exceed that amount.  It follows, therefore, that a widow  whose  husband&apos;s pre-warearnings did not exceed 27s. Cd. a week is similarly ineligible for analternative  pension.  All - claims tn alternative  pensions must  be forwarded to  theMinistry with the Enquiry Officcr&apos;s  Report.  Applications should  not be sent  direct from District and Sub-Committees, but must be submitted through the Local Committee.Nov.  15TH.  CIRCULAR 127. Prosecutions  for  Fraud.

Each man discharged as unfit, will be  handed four coupons tothe value  of 27s. Cd.  each, as a temporary allowance, and this allowance will be continued by the Pensions Issue Office until thequestion of pension has been decided.  Before each man&apos;s discharge from the Camp, information will beBent to tho man&apos;s Local Committee stating his name and address,and any necessary  particulars regarding him.  Committees  are asked to depute a Visitor to see each man and give him such advice and assistance as his case requires, and take steps to secure for himany medical treatment necessary.Nov.  30TH.

CIRCULAR  130. Duration of Institutional   Treatment.  Men may be retained in institutions and full allowances may bpaid in respect of  them, so long as  the  Minister is satisfied on medical grounds that the  discharged  men may  reasonably teexpected to derive more benefit  by continued treatment in an institution  than otherwise.  When  tho Medical  Practitioner incharge of the case  is  not able to  state that the above conditionis fulfilled, the case may nevertheless be retained in the institutionat tho charge of tho Ministry but tho allowances issued in respectof tho man may be subject to reduction.
