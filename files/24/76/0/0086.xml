IV.  FORESTRY.        (a)  Brushwood Burning.              Reference  is made to  the Board&apos;s Report of 6th January    last regarding  the clearing and burning of brushwood.  Replies ha!    been received from about half of the OwnerB of woodlands to whom j    the Board&apos;s  circular  letter was issued, and the returns show the j    total  acreage for  each County of Scotland requiring to be cleared:    and burned for  which  no labour  is expected to be available locallj    during 1919.  The  total amounts to approximately 20,000 acres.              Under the present system of demobilisation of the Force    the Board  have  been unable to proceed with a scheme for utilising    the services of soldiers, awaiting demobilisation, on this work.    The Board  have  however laid the facts before&apos;the Kinietry of Labo                                                                    I        (b)  Collection and Importation of Seed.              Reports  show that the crop of coniferous seed in Scotiaj    this year  is extremely poor and that Nurserymen are not inclined    make further efforts  to have collections made from the recently    felled woodland areas in view of the poverty of the crop and of t    scarcity of  labour.   The Board  have made arrangements however in    few areas  in which it is reported that coniferous seed may be ob-    ttained, for the collection of  the seel available by means of    casual labour and the employment of schoolboys.              The board have prospects cf again securing a consignment!    of forest  tree  seed  from the Canadian Government.  The board have!    also taken steps to assist the  Nursery trade in their endeavour tl    remove the restrictions, on the exportation of forest tree seed  j    from Franoe, recently imposed by the French Government.V.
