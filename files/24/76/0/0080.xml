&quot; A ft i391                                           13th March  1919- - -&quot;Jffli  (MISER FliPgRAMMBADMJIALJA LAAIPXAMM for FLIP. WAR CABINET..,.AI      The . Board of Admiralty have again had under consideration the question of the completion or cancellation of &quot;Howe&quot;, &quot;Rodney&quot; and ,fAnson&quot;, the three Battle Cruisers building in Private Yards&apos;,  upon which work has &quot;been suspended since March 1917.      An Admiralty Memorandum. (G.T..6653) was considered in January last at War Cabinet 517 (Minute 2), w,en it was decided to postpone the consideration of the question until it was known what lines would be taken at the Peace Congress respecting Naval armaments.      The Board of Admiralty have now decided that these three  vessels should be removed from the&quot;slips and cancelled, the reasons which have led them to make this decision being as follows:-   (1)  It now seems safe to assume that under the Final Peace  Terms     the German Battle Cruisers will neither be returned to Germany     nor disposed of in ;any way prejudicial to our Naval predominance..   (2)  The slips in which these ships are building would be of the     greatest value for building Merchant Ships of&quot;the largest  type,     which ar^ urgently required.   In two, cases out of the three a     keel will be placed on the berth immediately the Battle Cruisers     are cleared.   (3)  Now that labour is available considerable, sums are accruing     due by way of compensation for the periods during which the slips      iro kept out of action and Contractors&apos; plant is lying idle.      &apos;  Labour, -which, in order to avoid unemployment, is now being    employed on certain Destroyers that are not actually required,    might to a considerable extent be diverted to Merchant Ship con-    struction if theso slips are .sot free for the purpose.   (5)  The design of the Battle Cruisers is now nearly four years old,    so-that,, if completed, thoy would be far from up-to-date vessels..  .    It is becoming increasingly apparent that if further Battle    Cruisers are built considerable modifications of design will be    necessary, involving the taking down of a&quot; portion of the hull work    already constructed.   (6)j If tho slips are now used for the construction of Merchant    Shipsj two of them aro likely to become again available for a    large Warship in irm 15 to 1.8 months and the third in about two     roars from tne present time..     0  It is understood that the &quot;War Cabinet take the view that the    United States of America need not, for  the present at any rate, bo    considered a potential enemy.  .          The Admiralty, however, feel bound,:.to emphasise the facts stated in the Memorandum G.T., 6b53 that the United States Naval Programme provides for the building of six Battle. Cruisers, and that if that Programme is proceeded with, our shortage in Battle Cruisers must be r doe died-, otherwise we shall before long,&apos; fall behind the United States Navy in ships of that class.  .      It will bo essential, therefore, that the nuestion of our - position as regards Battle Cruiser  strength should be - considered at  &apos; the. earliest moment possible after the&apos; Terms of Poace are finally.. settled, and in the meantime the.preparation of new designsfor the battle cruiser type is being taken in hand.  .                          (Signed) - 7.H.. LONG.fl3th March 1919.  .                                THIS PACW^^t;!5:JI^C/E^ !l!X-2! -                              ----. T7&apos;&quot;      .,r.;-nment.
