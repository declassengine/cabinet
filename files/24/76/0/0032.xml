Brief notes showing main objects of the olausea           in the Housing Bill.Olause 1.  At present no express duty is imposed upon  Local     Authorities to survey the housing need a  of their  Districts     and remedy any shortage by providing houses.   This  clause     imposes such a duty and requires definite schemes to  be     submitted to the Board within a definite time.  It  provides     for joint action in suitable cases.  The Board may  confirm     the schemes with or without modification and schemes  are     then binding.Clause 2,  Makes it a duty of a local authority to oarry out the     scheme as confirmed, within a specified  period.Olause S.  If a Local Authority fails to perform its duties     under Clause 1 or Clause 8, the Board ma,y authorise the     County Council to perform the duties. If for any other     reason the Board think that the duties should be  performed     by the County Council instead of by the  minor authority,     the Board may authorise the Council to perform them.Olause 4,  This enables the Board themselves  to act in oase of     the failure of a Local Authority or County Council  to carry     out a housing scheme.  If the Board so act they may recover     the expenses incurred from the Looal Authority originally     in default.Clause 5.  Schemes under Parts I and II of the Housing of  the&quot;     Working Classes Act, 1890, are schemes for the olearance     and improvement of unhealthy areas,  The Board have no     statutory power at present to compel Local Authorities to     exercise their powers of making schemes  under these Parts     unless they are moved thereto by complaints from  ratepayers     or other bodies or by a failure of the local authority to     adopt an official representation from their own medical     offioer cf health,  This clause would clothe the  Board with     an independent power to require a Local  Authority to  act     and to authorise a County Counoil to act on default or     themselves to act.Clause 6,  ThiB Clause empowers the Board to  contribute  out of     moneys to be provided by Parliament to the losses incurred     by a Local Authority in carrying out housing schemes  whether     under their general powers under Part III of the  Housing of     the Working Classes Act, 1890, as amended by the  Bill, or     in connection with the clearance and improvement  of     unhealthy areas under Parts I and II of  that Act.  The terms     of financial assistance proposed to be afforded are     contained in the Board&apos;a Circular letter of 6th February,     1919.Clause 7,   This merely gives to County Councils who  proTi-de     houses for their employees under any existing powers the     advantage of the same periods for repayment of loans as     are available to Looal Authorities under the Housing Acts.Clause 8,  This Clause is to be taken out of the Housing Bill     and incorporated in the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of     Compensation) Bill.
125  tOlauae 9.  This would enable a local Authority that  has     obtained power to take lands compulsorily to  enter  on  the     lands without first complying with various provisions  of     the Lands Clauses Aot, 1845, which require prior payment     of the compensation awarded to be paid in respect of the     interests of the several parties, or deposit  in a bank the     amount of compensation claimed &amp;o, &amp;o\Clause 10.  The first Sohedule to the Housing, Town  Planning,     &amp;o77 Act, 1909, contains the provisions applicable  to  the     compulsory acquisition of lands by local authorities for     the purposes of housing schemes under,  art III  of the  Act     of 1890.  &quot;Where&quot; objections are taken to the Compulsory     Order the Board must,direct local inquiry into  the  matter.     In the oases of rurai districts the inquiry ia  held by one     of the Board&apos;a Inspectors, but paragraph (7)  of the     Schedule requires that in the case of lands in  London  or a     borough or urban district the inquiry must be held  by  an     impartial person not in the Board&apos;s employment  and  if  the     Board confirm the order oontrary to any report  of such     person the order becomes provisional and requires oonfirma-     tlon by Parliament.               This provision causes delay and additional     expense and in the Board&apos;e experience fails to  serve any     useful purpose.  The clause makes the procedure whioh     applies in rural districts applioable generally.Clause      The clause would place upon the owners of land     oompuleorily acquired the burden of the costs of the     arbitration if the looal authority have offered a sum  equal     to or in exoess of that awarded by the arbitrator or if the     owner has not given such information as would have  enabled     the local authority to make a proper offer.  Generally the     clause makes the costs within the discretion  of the     arbitrator.               It is presumed that this Clause will  be omitted     from the Housing Bill in view of the provisions of  Clause 5     of the Acquisition of Land Bill.Clause ^,2.   The 2nd Schedule to the Housing of the  Working     Classes Act, 1890, contains a code of provisions applioable     to the compulsory acquisition of lands for the  purpose of     en improvement scheme under Part I of that Act.  The     clause proposes certain amandraenta in those provisions     whioh have been rooouimended to the Board as desirable  for     simplifying end shortening procedure.O^aupft Iff.  This Clause removes certain doubts as  to the powers     of the Local Authority in  regard to the acquisition of lands     and buildings for the purposes of Part III of the Housing of     the Working Classes Act, 1890, as to the provision  of     houses for the working classes.  It will enable  (l) houses     to be acquired by the Looal Authority and improved by them     so as to be suitable in all respects for habitation:   (&amp;)     and land to be acquired by the Loo*l Authority for the     purpose of being leased to other persons for the provision&quot;-     of houses for the working classes or for desirable  purposes     in connection with the development of the land as a building     estate, e.g. an admixture of houses of a somewhat better     type.Clause 14.  This is a Clause which in somewhat different form,     was passed by Standing Committee on a Housing Bill  before     the House of Commons in 1912,which did not become law.  It
     enables Looal Authorities to  seize  favourable opportunities     Of acquiring property in unhealthy  areas  in  anticipation of     a scheme for the imp:oremant  of the areae under Part 1 or     Part II of the Housing of the Working  Classes Aot, 1800.QlftUfte 16.  Removes a difficulty in regard  to  the acquisition     of water rights needed for affording water supply to houses     provided under housing schemes.Clause \p.  This Clause brings together  in  an  improved and     simplified form some existing powers in various Housing     Acts as to leasing and disposal of  land,  and will enable     land to &quot;be leased for the purposes  indicated in the note     (2) on Clause 13.Cy^se 17.  Section 72 of the Housing, Tow Planning, &amp;c, Act,     190$, enabled County Councils to give  certain assistance on     the general lines of this clause&amp;e to certain  societies     having for their object the erection or improvement of     dwellings for the working o las bos.   The olause in the Bill     substitutes for the existing enactment a  provision empower-     ing oil local authorities under Part III  of  the Housing of     the Working Classes Aot, 1890, as well as County Councils,     to promote the formation of publio  utility sooieties and     to give finencial assistance to such sooieties with the     Board&apos;a oonsant subject to regulations made  by the Board.Claue^1$.  This Clause empowers the Board  to  contribute out of     moneys to to provided by Parliament te the loss incurred by     a public utility society or a housing  trust  as defined in     the Bill in carrying out housing sohemee  tlthin a period     spoolfiod by the Board.Claufo If.  this Clause makes some  Amendments  in  section 67 of.........&quot;the Houaing of the forking Classes  *ot, 1I$C,  in  regard to     loans from the fcublio Works Lean Camlet loners to publio.     utility societies, with a view to assisting  the carrying     out of housing schemes by such sooieUes  more  especially     during the emergency period.  Xt makes it clear that loans     may be advanced  for  the purchase and development  of lend     and purchase and improvement of houses,   Xt  extends the     maximum period for repayment of loons  from 40  to  50 years     &quot;*ith a consequential amendment in paragraph  (b).  It aleo     increases the maximum amount *hich may be advanced  during     on emergency period  to be determined by the  Board from     two-thirds of the value of the property mortgaged to three-     quarters of  the  cost;  and enables advancea  to  be made  as     the building ef  any house proceeds.Clauds  20.  $his Clause would enable Local Authorities to  v   e.dve*.ee money to the owners ef suitable houses on proper     security to  enable the emers  to reconstruct!  enlarge,  or     improve the houses.  In many  eases  the owners have  sot  the     mams of carrying out  desirable improvements but  would be     willing to do everything neoessory  if loans on fair terms     were  advanced by local  authorities.Clause ,21*  This  Clause is  intended to  remove difficulties     caused by  the  existence  cf building byelaws fee.  ifoioh are     toe  restrictive  in certain matters  connected with the     laying out of new streets  and the  erection of buildings.      Such byelaws would under  the  Clause be inoperative as      regards any  housing  scheme approved by the Board, and the     LqOoI  Authorities might  also  under the Clause themselves      consent te  similar departures from their byelaws in the     case of works carried out by private  enterprise.   Somewhat
127if     similar powers ae to exemptions from byelaws were  approved     by the Standing Committee on the Housing Bill  of 1912  to     which reference has been made.Clause 22. This Clause is intended to enable  more oontrol to be     exercised by Local Authorities  in regard to houses  let in     lodgings or occupied by persons of more  than one family or     in regard to the conversion of a house into two or  more     separate dwellings, so as to secure proper sanitary arrange-     ments, cleanliness, ventilation, water supply,  food     borage, &amp;o.  For the purpose of meeting cases  in  vihioh     difficulties would arise in carrying out the necessary     works by reason of the provisions of the lease, power  is     given to the local authority to vary the lease, and power     is also given to the local authority to  grant  a oharging     order in oases where it is right that the superior  landlord     should bear part of the cost.Clauay 23.  This Clause is reproduced from the Housing Bill of     1912 already referred to.  At present Tfoere a  dosing  order     has been made in respect of a houac and  the occupier has     vacated the house there is nothing to prevent  the owner     again letting the house and so  causing the local authority     the inconvenience of notifying the new tenant  to quit  and so     on.  This Clause puts a penalty on the owner for resetting     in such a case.C^auje $4.  This also ia reproduced from the  Housing Bill of 1912.     It places London in precisely the same position as  other     parts of the country in regard to re-housing of persons     displaoed by the operation of improvement schemes  under     Part I cf the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890.Clause gfo.  Enables Looal Authorities to expedite their  own     procedure by delegating their powers to  committees.Clause ?6.  This Clause effects some minor amendments in the     Housing Acts whioh have been recommended to the Board  as     desirable for simplifying and shortening procedure  or  have     been shown to be desirable in the course of the Board&apos;a     administration of those Acts.  Some of them were included     in the Housing Bill of 1912 above referred to,Cla^e^ 27.  Definitions.  The definition of  &quot;public  utility     society* differs from that in the Housing, Town Planning,     &amp;c., Act, 1909, by substituting &quot;six per oont&quot;  for &quot;five     per ceht&quot;.Clause 28.  This Clause emending the Small Dwellings Acquisition     Act, 1899, proposes to give effect to recommendations  whioh     have been made in the Final Report of the Housing  (financial     Assistance) Committee appointed by the Minister of  Kecon-     struction.  The ohanges are suggested in consequence of     the altered circumstances in regard to oost of house     building and values of houses and are considered to     represent more nearly present day needs  as compared with     those in 1899 in regard to the houses whioh should be     within the scope of the Act and the amounts which  may  be     properly advanced by Looal Authorities  for the purpose of     their acquisition.  The clause also enables Looal  Authorities     to reconvey a mortgage made under the Act by  a simple     receipt endorsed an the mortgage.Clause      Repeals.     Clause      Title.
