With reference  to the decision  recorded  in Minute 5 ofthe 4th Meeting, Mr.  Chapman mentioned  that  he  feared thatsome  difficulty might be occasioned in  the  carrying out  of thedecision, in view of the fact that under regulations until recentlym force no second-hand railway wagons could be sold  without thesanction of the Minister of Munitions.  He thought that the word-ing of the decision contained in the draft Minutes referred to wasnot sufficiently explicit upon this point.    Mr.  Layton said  that the Ministry  of  Munitions  wereremoving their control in the matter.    It was agreed that-    In order to&apos; remove any  possible misapprehension, the wording        of the decision in  Minute 5 of the  4th Meeting should        read as follows: [1205]-335B
Return of Stocks.Re-exports.             &quot; That all control on railway material, whether new         or  second-hand, and all  restrictions on its exportation         should be removed forthwith.&quot;  2. Mr. Chapman said that the President of the Board of Tradewas of  opinion  that it was desirable to publish a report  of the stocks created during the war in order that the public might knowexactly what the position was.    The Chairman said that he thought that this matter  shouldbe taken up by the Board of Trade, and that such action as waanecessary should be taken by the President of the Board, withoutthe question being considered by the Conference.  3. Mr. Chapman raised the question of re-exports, to which hehad made reference at the previous meeting  (vide Minute 5, 6thMeeting). The question was closely connected with that of main-taining our foreign rates of exchange.    The Chairman  said  that  he considered  that the question should be considered at a subsequent meeting of the Conference,when  the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of Statefor India could, he hoped, be able to attend.Controls Exer-cised by the  Boardof Trade.(a.)  Coal.(b.) Railways.(c.) Canals.(d.) Tramways.(i.) Road Transport.(/.) Horses.  4. The Conference then proceeded to  consider the question of controls maintained by the Board of Trade, which were set out ina table produced before the Conference.     It was agreed that      This question should be held in abeyance pending the receipt         of &quot;the report of the Coal Mines  Commission.     The Chairman said that in view of  the fact that the controlof railways was to be maintained for two years after the war, andof the fact that it was  proposed to  transfer the control from theBoard of Trade to the new Ministry of Ways and Communications,he did not consider that the question need be considered by theConference.     The Chairman said that the same remarks applied as in thecase of railways.     The Chairman  pointed out  that  the Ministry  of NationalService no longer exercised any control  as  regards  priority oflabour, and that the Ministry of Munitions had similarly ceased tocontrol the priority of material     It was decided that      Any remaining control with regard to  tramways should  be        abolished.     It was decided that      Such regulations as still remained in  foTce should be abolished        forthwith.     The Chairman pointed out that the only  remaining control was  over hay and straw, and he asked General Morgan to statewhat the attitude of the War Office was with regard to the con-tinuance of this control.     General Morgan stated that the  Army Council did not intend to exercise any control on this year&apos;s crop of hay, but in view of theshortage of fodder in the country it was absolutely necessary thatsome rationing scheme should be enforced for the present.     It was decided  that      The Board of Trade should communicate with the Controller        of Horse Transport on the subject.
(g.)  Petrol.(k.) Cotton.(t.) Timber.(/.) Paper.     Mr. Chapman said that he understood that the present system with regard to the rationing of petrol and petroleum was necessary for the collection of taxes under the current Finance Act.     Mr. McFadyean stated that this control must  be continued pending the passing of this year&apos;s Finance Act.  In  addition it was necessary to exercise a control  on the import of  petrol and petroleum  with a  view  to  securing proper distribution between the Allies.     The Chairman expressed*the view that it was most desirable that the internal control over retail distribution should  be removed as soon as possible.     It was decided that      The Treasury  should investigate the question with a view to         removing  the control over  retail  distribution  at  the         earliest possible date.     Mr. Chapman stated that with regard to Egyptian cotton, the British and Egyptian Governments had bought the entire crop, and that an arrangement had been made between the two Govern- nients for the sale of this cotton  in this country,  which  was due to expire on August 31,1919.   He said that the Board of Trade were in favour of the removal of the control at the earliest possible date. With regard  to non-Egyptian cotton, he said that there was no control in force at  present,  except as regards the maximum price for  raw  cotton.   Liverpool  traders   wished  to  retain  the maximum  price, as it  proved most useful to  them in framing estimates for  contracts.   He, personally, however, recommended its removal when the present arrangement^terminated on April 30.     It was  decided that      All control on cotton should be  abolished on April 30, 1919,         excepting  that  the control over Egyptian cotton  should         terminate on July 31, 1919.  -     With regard to timber, Mr. Chapman said that  there was no control except in  the case  of pit-wood, and that the Coal and Timber Controllers feared that a crisis would arise if this control was removed,  owing to  the  shortage of wood for pit-props.     The control was of two kinds:     (a) Area  control, by which pit-wood  cut  in  a  particular           district could not be sold outside  that district.    (b) Control of imports,  by which the import of pit-wood was           limited to South Wales ports.    With  regard  to the second  of  these two controls,  as  it was  probable  that a higher  price could be obtained for imported pit-wood  at ports  other than  those  in  South  Wales,  it  was feared that if this control  was removed all imported pit-woodWould go to other ports,  and thereby, in view of tonnage restric-tions, cause  a serious shortage of pit-wood in South Wales.    It was  decided that     All control on non-pit-wood timber should  be removed, and        that the control on  pit-wood timber should be removed on        March 31, 1919, unless  the Coal and Timber Controllers        put forward to the President  of  the  Board  of Trade,        before March 24, adequate reasons for the continuance of        the control.    The Chairman pointed  out that a decision had already been arrived at by the Conference regarding the abolition of the papercontrol (vide Minute 3 of the 5th Meeting).    Mr. Chapman  said that there was  still some question withregard  to the continuance of the &quot; no-returns  order.&quot;  It  had
(k) Matches.Commoditiescontrolled by theAdmiralty.CommoditiesControlled by theMinistry ofMunitions.(a.) Iron and Steel-(b.) Fertilisers.(c.) Seeds, Oils, and fats.been agreed that the order should not be revoked without consult-ing the newspapers.   The present position was, that -the news-papers could not agree, and so the order remained in force.    Sir A. Mond said that he thought the reason for the difference of opinion among newspapers was that those newspapers whichwere endeavouring to increase their circulation desired the abolition -tion of the order, whereas those whose circulation was stationary;desired it to  be retained.    It was decided that     This  order  should be  rescinded  at  once,  subject  to  the        concurrence of the  President of  the Board of  Trade,        together with other restrictions on paper.    After a  short  discussion as to the necessity for the orderrestricting the sale of  matches other  than those of particularbrands, it was decided that-    All restrictions on the  sale of matches  should be removed        forthwith.5. M.r Chadwyck-Healey said that the Admiralty had exercised over various  commodities, such as  shipbuilding steel,controloxygen  and hydrogen cylinders, but that the only cases in whichtbey were still exercising control were over hemp, jute  and flax,over which  the control was exercised by the Admiralty in con-junction with the War Office,  the Admiralty being interested inthe question in order to ensure an adequate supply of coal bags.The Admiralty was also concerned in the control of Japanese silk.He was of opinion that  there was no longer any necessity for these controls to be exercised, and he promised to make arrangementsfor a tabular statement, showing: all  the commodities over  whichthe Admiralty had exercised  control, to  be  submitted to  theChairman.    It was agreed that-    (a.) The control on.hemp,  jute, and  flax should be considered          in connection with the War Office controls.      - -    &apos;(&amp;.) Steps should be taken to remove the control of Japanese          silk.    The control on hemp,  jute, and flax should be considered in        connection with the War Office  controls.  6.  The Chairman  then  proceeded to  deal with the  question ofthe controls exercised by  the  Ministry  of  Munitions,  of  which astatement was submitted to the Conference.     It was agreed that      All control should be abolished on  April 30, 1919, unless the         War Cabinet came to a definite decision to the contrary.     Mr.  Lay ton said  that the  control of  ammonia  had  beenrescinded,  and  that  the control  of  (Kelp  group)  potassiumcompounds  had been removed.  The control of other fertiliserswas  necessitated at  the present time by the Government&apos;s agree-meht with  the  farmers,  but  the  Ministry  of  Munitions  were taking the  necessary steps  for the agreement to  terminate onMay 31*     It was agreed that      All control of fertilisers should be removed on May 31, unless         the War  Cabinet  came to  a  definite  decision to the         contrary.     Mr.  Lay ton said  that this control was  being maintained atpresent at the request of the Food Ministry.     Mr.  Colter  said  that a meeting  was  taking place at theMinistry of Food that day on the subject, and that the Ministryhoped that  arrangements might be made  for the discontinuance of the control at an early date.   He feared  that if the control were   * The Board of Agriculture were, however, asking for the announcements to be withheld pending consideration of the position after May./

It was decided that      The control of seeds,  oils, and  fats should  be removed OIL         April 30,  1919.     Mr. Layton said that the control had been maintained up to the present in order to obtain the by-products, but he agreed that this reason for the continuance of the control no longer held good.     It was decided that      The control of blast furnace  dust should be withdrawn on         April 30,  1919.     Mr. Layton said that the control  of  glass and  glassware (including  potassium compounds  other  than  Kelp)  had  been maintained entirely-in the  interests of the trade, which was of recent development in this  country, and was practically  a &quot; key industry.&quot;     It was decided that      The control of glass  and  glassware should  be transferred to         the Board of  Trade.    Mr. Layton said that the control had been preserved in orderto maintain a standard of inspection for the sake of the  general public.    Mr. Chapman said  that  two  problems appeared  to  deserveconsideration:     (1) The maintenance of the industry. -    (2) The inspection of the  product.    It was decided that     The control of  this  industry  should  be  transferred to the         Board of Trade, arrangements being made,  if necessary,         by the  Local  Government  Board  under  their health         administration for the requisite testing to be carried out.    Mr. Layton said that this control was maintained in  orderto protect  what was a key industry.   An  agreement had  been signed that the output of the Empire should be purchased by theMinistry for six months after  the ratification of peace.  Negotia- tions were going on with a view to modifying the agreement, as it was clear that, if production continued at the present rate, there would  be no demand for tungsten for five years  after the  removalof the  control  (say at the  end of 1919).    The Chairman said  that, as the Government had made theagreement, they  must adhere to it; but from the point  of  view ofboth parties some modification of the agreement was clearly desir-able, and he thought that the Ministry of Munitions  should layemphasis on this.     It was decided that     The Ministry  of Munitions should do  everything  possible to         secure a modification of their agreements with regard to         tungsten.    Mr. Layton  said that  mica was required largely for the manu-facture of  magnetos, and the  Ministry of Munitions hoped thatarrangements  might be made by which the mica trade would becentred in  London.  The  trade was a very small one, and therewere no notable merchants in the trade to whom they could entrust the supervision,  e.g:, the  work of  classifying the products by a standard.  He thought that the Industrial Section of the Boardof Trade would  be the proper authority to take up the necessarysupervision.                                                    C
G(*.) Gas.(j.) Gas Works    Betort Carbon.(k.) Machine Tools.(I.) Bricks.     It was DECIDED THAT      THE control OF  mica  SHOULD BE transferred TO THE BOARD OF         Trade, AND that the Board SHOULD USE EVERY ENDEAVOUR TO         make  the necessary arrangements  WITH THE MOST  PRO-         minent firms IN THE TRADE.     Mr. Chapman said that the Board of Trade had approached the Coal Controller on the subject of the control OF  gas.  -this control was of two kinds: first, in respect of the by-products; and,secondly,  as regards  the  quality  of gas  manufactured.   Inconsequence of the cessation of hostilities, there was NO longer any demand for the by-products, and therefore there was no necessityfor  the  continuance of the  first-named  control, which it  was proposed to revoke.  It was necessary, however, to maintain  somecontrol of gas in view of the shortage of coal, and for this reason it was not possible to allow  the gas companies to restore thepre-war calorific quality of gas.    Mr. Layton said that the control HAD IN BOTH THESE CASES BEENpreserved for financial reasons connected WITH THE LIQUIDATION of contracts.    It was decided  that     The control of  these  commodities should BE WITHDRAWN ON         April 30, 1919.    Mr. Layton said that the Ministry of Munitions had abolishedthe control of  prices and  the  licensing  system, but decided to reserve the right of allocation  of  output in order  to safeguardsupplies  for the Government building scheme, because it was feared that if control were withdrawn manufacturers might takeadvantage  of any chance that might arise of disposing of their output at a higher price and so delay the date of delivery.    Sir A If red Mond suggested that this difficulty might BE OVER-come by including in &quot;the contracts some condition as to delivery BYa particular date.             .    The  Chairman  thought  the control should be abolished, ANDthat if powers were required later on to ensure  THE fulfilling of contracts the necessary steps could be taken as AND WHEN THE OCCA-sion demanded.    It was decided  that     The control of bricks should be abolished forthwith.Food Kestric-tions.(a.) Sugar.  7.  The Chairman then referred to the question of  food controldealt with in. the statement submitted to  the Conference by theMinistry of Food.    Mr. McCurdy said  that every commodity  presented a NEWquestion.   For example, in the case  of milk, negotiations  werepending for the control  of  distribution  in  order  to ensure ANadequate supply of clean milk to all classes.     Mr. Colter said that  the control of  sugar was necessitatedmainly on account of the lack of supplies.   It had to BE borne inmind that five-sevenths of our pre-war supplies came from enemy countries, and  the position was further aggravated at present BYstrikes (e.g., Cuba)  and shipping difficulties. HE said he believedthere were twenty-seven weeks&apos; supplies of sugar in the country,and he added that the Sugar Commission had carried out their taskextremely well, and he thought the control could safely BE left INtheir hands until  the   autumn, when  it  might be possible TOremove  it.                                               t(&amp;.) Jam.    Mr. Colter said that the control in this case also was necessary on account of the lack of supplies.   The production OF jam from
(c.) Butter.(d.) Cheese.(e.) Milk.this year&apos;s fruit crop was rendered more difficult owing to the factthat no sugar could&apos;be allowed to private makers for this purpose.It was true that arrangements had been made for a special ration of sugar to jam producers last year, but he doubted  whether itcould be done this year.  On the other hand, it had to be borne in mind that confectioners were now allowed an unlimited supply,and that the ration of individuals had been increased.    Mr.  Cotter said that from  the point of view of supply butterwas the worst commodity with which they had to  deal.  He didnot anticipate there would be an adequate supply of butter untilJune  1920.  However, he hoped that rationing could be abolishedthis summer, the control of distribution only being maintained.     In the case of cheese, Mr. Coiler said, the difficulty of supplywas largely connected with tonnage restrictions.    The treasury had been  asked to sanction the purchase of the Canadian crop ofcheese, but he feared that, owing to lack of tonnage, we should not obtain it when  we required it, even if the  Treasury gave theirsanction.     With regard to milk, Mr.  Cotter said that, as already stated by Mr. McCurdy, it was not proposed to withdraw the control of milk, as it was hoped to institute extra standards of purity and togiant permissive arrangements to municipalities for  reasons ofpublic health.     Mr. Cotter, in conclusion, said that his Ministry were anxiousto know on what permanent department the question of the controlof prices should devolve.Export Restric-tions Affected byAbolition of domestic Controls.Discussion of minute 1 of 3rdMeeting.  8. Captain Hotham drew attention  to  the  fact  that certain articles were never controlled as regards export owing to the factthat the internal control exercised in this country precluded thepossibility of export.  He  said that it  might be necessary to seethat, after the  internal control was- removed,  restrictions were retained on the export of certain  commodities to certain  othercountries.  9. The Chairman referred to some correspondence which hadtaken place regarding an amendment proposed by Sir A. Mond tothe Minutes recording a statement made by Sir A. Mond  regardingthe Overseas  Trade Department.    After a  brief discussion, the Chairman  decided  that  thepassage in question should read:         &apos; &quot; Sir A. Mond said, on the question of office accommoda-    tion, that an extension of the Foreign Office building had been    contemplated, but that it had been stopped owing  to lack of    materials, and he added, in regard to Sir A. Steel-Maitland&apos;s    point, that  he had understood recently from  Sir A. Stanley   &apos; that in a scheme  that  is Contemplated for reorganising  the    Board of Trade it is proposed that the Overseas Trade Depart-    ment should become attached to or even absorbed in  the Board    of Trade.         &quot; In view of the possibility of such a reorganisation,  the    question of where the accommodation of the Overseas Trade    Department should be  situated,  had.become more  than ever    doubtful, and must be postponed until the other question was    settled.&quot;                                  (Initialled)      A.
