     His Britannic Ma,majesty&apos;s Covernment.       PROTECTION OP CONSUMERSMemorandum by the Pood Controller.-fa.     1.     The Consumers1 Council have recommended that in the     following detailed respects, the control exercised by the     Ministry of Pood should be made permanent,        (a) Net weight            Express provision has been made in certain of the Pood     Controller1s Orders that articles shall be sold by net weight     (e.g. especially tea, jam, bread, potatoes, canned meat, wheat,     rye oats and barley, horse and poultry mixtures, and cattle feed-     ing stuffs,)  It is recommended that these provisions should be     continued and made permanent.            It may be noted that a select committee was appointed by     the House of Commons in 1914 to enquire &quot;whether any and if so     what steps should be taken to protect purchasers of goods sold in     packages and of bread from short weight or measure&quot;.  The chief     recommendations of this committee which reported on July 15th,1914     were thats-            (I)     Short weight or measure generally in the retail                  sale of goods should be made a statutory offence.           (tt)  -   It should be illegal to sell tea, coffee, or cocoa                  powder retail except by net weight.          (Ill)     Bread should be sold by weight only and in parcels                  of 1 lb. or multiples of 1 lb.     ^       No steps have been taken by Parliament to give effect to     theBe recommendations.        (b) Specification.            In a number of cases the Ministry of Pood have required     certain standards of quality and specifications to be complied     with in order to secure to the consumer that a proper article is     supplied (e.g.  especially margarine,  compound lard,  and.certain     other fats,  Jam,  sausages,,)   The Council recommend that such     regulations should be maintained in the form of permanent     legislation.        (c) Exhibition by retailers of prices.            The Consumers1  Council consider that the exhibition of     prices by retailers is an elementary and proper safeguard to the     consumer and  recommend that &quot;the price of staple articles of food     shall so far  as is reasonably possible be exhibited in a place     where it is  easily visible to a consumer&quot;.   This provision has     been included in many of the Orders issued  by the Ministry.     2.      I am in  accord with these recommendations; and I should be     glad  to  receive the approval of the Cabinet to tho introduction     of  a  Bill by  which power is given to  the Pood Controller (or     other competent minister to be specified by Order in Council)  to     deal  with the questions  of net weight,  specification and quality,i**cL  exhibition of prices  by retailers on  the lines set out In this     memorandum.MINISTRY OF POOD, 28th February, 1919.GEO. H. ROBERTS.
