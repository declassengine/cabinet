The ex-Bussian T.BoD.- &quot;Spartak&quot;, which was handed overby H.M. Government to the Esthonians has been renamed &quot;Wambola&apos;&apos;,and after refit is now ready for service *        Esthonian troops have cleared the island of Osel ofBolsheviks, and they appear to have completely held up theBolshevik offensive on&quot; the mainlands  &apos;?indau has been&apos;recapturedfrom the Bolsheviks 0        On the 27th February the s,s. &quot;Hyltonia&quot; and &quot;Holywood&quot;with arms and stores arrived at Bevel where the food situationis reported to be serious0        At Libau certain complications arose during the weekwhich necessitated the dispatch of HJLS. &quot;Phaotontf,&quot;Viceroy&quot;,and nVerdun&quot; which arrived at Libau on 28th Februaryo  the trouble was due to a Swedish Colonel and a Swedish Doctor con-spiring with Baltic nobility to overthrow the Lettish GovernmenteBoth Swedes have been arrested, and all is now quiet.        German troops.are still landing at Libau.        The Commander-in-Chief has ordered the closing of the base at Genoa,        A conflict has taken place in the main street of Leghornbetween French and Italian soldiers, in which the former appearto have been the aggressors,   The American Consul reports that20 French were killed and a large number wounded.  The FrenchGovernment are extremely anxious that nothing should appear inthe English press about the affair and reference to it has been stopped in the French and Italian pr6.ss0  A Commission ofOfficers has been sent to investigate,        It is hoped that the incident connected with the releaseof our prisoners&apos; at Misurata is now closed.  The latest reportsshow that Ramadan Stewi has gained do much prestige by the direct negotiations and the visit of a British warship, that he has again obtained the upper hand and the Italians 1 ear that theycannot now restore their authority without fighting.       The British and French Governments agree that allied control of Greek ports should now cease and all Allied forcesbe withdrawn, except at Imbros, Lemnos and Tenedos.  ILVenizelosalso requests that the British Naval Mission should abandoncontrol&apos;at the Piraeus.                      ADRIATICf        The blockade of all Adriatic ports has been raised asfrom March 1st.        A British Commission has been established at Triestefor the control of food supplies to enemy countries.        The American delegate on the Admirals&apos; Committee hasnow been informed that his Government maintain that decisions                                                     aS tO c a a o (
as  to requisitioning should in every case rest with the Committee.        All  ox-Austro-Huuj^ri^m-il-eet auxiliaries suitable for commercial purposes are to he requisitioned and satisfactorysteps have been taken to ensure  feat all &amp;x-Aus .tr o-Hungar i ah -ships fly the /ULT/C. flag,        Representative ship?: of  the ex-Austro-Hungarian Navy arebeing sent to Venice for the satisfaction of the Italianpopulation.        Following on the arrival of an Italian warship at .   . v-Ssalato, two Italian naval Captains were attacked in the streetsby   Jugo-Glav crowd.   The Italian Club was damaged and theItalian flag.flying on.a steamer was hauled down and insulted.The local authorities have apologised to the Italian Admiral and allied patrols have been landed.&quot; The garrison at Spalato con-eists of 800 Serbian troops.   The manifestations were due to fear of an Italian occupation, but the situation is now quietand normal and no more Incidents are anticipated.        There is a general impression that the Italians are becoming more and more isolated.  They continue to be on entirelyunsatisfactory terms with the French and Serbians, they are dis-liked and distrusted by the Americans,  and. though still out-wardly on /rood terms with the British,  their affection is waningthough their respect remains intact, &apos;  The- Austrians retain their former dislike and distrust and the Jugo-Slavs have transferredtheir hatred of the Austrians to the Italians,  Tho pro-Germanparty in Italy is recovering ground and should German Austriabe incorporated in any form&apos;&apos;with Germany,  a new Mittel-Europe ofGermany, German-Austria and Italy seems&apos; the most likely develop-ment of the present situation.        The American battalion at Plume has been withdrawn toGenoa, where the American troops in the Italian area are to be concentrated.            BLACK SEA. ill and DAMBTJl.        A General Licence has been issued authorising tradewith Turkey, Bulgaria and Black Sea ports.  An examinationservice will be established a$.Constantinople, and the Admiraltyanticipates the necessity, until peace is concluded,  of main-tainin.fr some restriction on trade&quot; with Turkey and Bulgaria,probably in the form of prohibiting imports of certain corn-modi ties and allowing neutrals to trade only at certain con-trolled ports.   It is not considered that an examination service at the Piraeus and Mudros would prove efficient.        The Ships repatriating German troops have now-been ordered to Hamburg and it has been am^yU that on their return journey they should convey undesirable Russians and Jews from england and&apos;Russian prisoners from France to Odessa.        The War Cabinet has decided that the C-in-0.? Moditerrantean, may give active assistance to the Volunteer Armies in south russia provided that no naval forces are landed without pennies-ion being obtained from England,   Comoetent Frenchxjpinionconsiders the Volunteer Army largely unreliable, and that largenumbers pass over to the Bolshevists, and Denikin himself isregarded with no&apos;little suspicion. Jhe Bolshevists are believed to&apos;&quot;be growing in numbers and&apos; their .       discipline is said tobe exemplary.        Efforts are being made to hasten the formation of the danube Commission so as to organise the river traffic which hasbecome urgent in view of the conditions prevailing in Roumania,but which&quot;is rendered difficult owing to&apos; the dual &quot;control exercised at present, Admiral Troubridge above the Iron Gatesand the Fiench below and owing to the shortage of coal.        Admiral Troubridge is&quot;of opinion that a proportion ofthe Danube Flotillas must be retained for oolice duties and notbe broken up.                                                     u\...... ....
                      0ASPIAI1 a        The situation as regards the disposal of the Russianflotilla at Baku is not yet settled, hut orders have been sentto the Senior Naval Officer,  Caspian, that if the crews had notdisembarked by 1st March, steps were at once to be taken to seize the ships by force, or if necessary to sink them.  Ifseised,  the Vmito&apos; Fnsign was to be  hoisted on board all ships.H.M.  Government refuse&apos; to recognise the desired expenditure&apos; of 40,000 for paying off the Russian crews.        It is expected that navigation from Astrakhan into the caspian will shortly be possible.  The Bolshevik naval forcesin the Caspian are 1 relieved to consist of 4 small fl\B.D?s  2submarines, and 9 armed steamers.   They are also believed to have some  aircraft, both aeroplanes and seaplanes-        It is understood&apos; that munitions are to be sent to assistthe Ural Cossacks at Guriev where they are reported to be15,000 strong.  It is expected that that pott will be ice freeon 3rd March&apos;.        The evacuation of the Turks from Arzir was? completed on15th February,, 1,050 Turks from Yemen left Ho do i da and 1,400Turin from the Taiz district arrived at Aden on 18th February, 1,300 Turks from Medina will be interned in Egyjet.        &quot;Diana&quot; is engaged on tho blockade of Arabia, and the7ar Office, have asked&quot; that the blockade of Yemen and Perim-Mokalla may continue until all Turks are evacuated.        The proposal that the German Fleet should be taken out                  propOn these terms it would be easy for them to claim the 1&apos;ion&apos;s share.    In Ease a general limitation of armaments is decideda proportionate the Peace Conference or by the League of Nations, it is anti-cipated that the Naval Forces allowed&quot;to each country will varydirectly with the size of its Navy at the date of the agreement,and .this may explain the intense anxiety on the part of&quot;france to increase their Fleet by the addition of as many German shipsas they can obtain.        The Serbian Government has appointed a French expert astechnical adviser on all matters connected with the developmentof waterways, and he has already commenced pieliminary surveysin Serbian&apos;rivers,        One Cruiser and seven Destroyers are on their way to Japan from European waters escorting four ex-German submarines.        The Japanese Naval Forces in Europe are now limitedto one Or uiser and four-Destroyers.        U.S. Ncival Forces have now been re-organised, the mainBattleship, Destroyer and Submarine strength remaining in                                                   American .....
American waters.  The divisions of the Battleship Force corn-posed of the latest Battleships and the Destroyer Force have proceeded to Cuba, where they will carry out exercises based onSuantanamo until about the miodle of this month.         Four Light Cruisers are detached from the AtlanticFleet for&quot;&quot;service in the South Pacific, i.e. 7est Coast ofSouth America.         One Cruiser and three Light Cruisers are detached fromthe Pacific Fleet for service in the South Atlantic,  ia),  east coast of South America.
