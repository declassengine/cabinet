^pI-OHa?  RELATING  TO  TEE  WORK  03?  THE   -^BOARD  OF  AGRICULTURE I?OR  SCOTLAND forr/i$8^the  WEEK  ending  26th FEBRUARY, 1919.FOOD PRODUCTION.   The weather has been cold but on the whole fairly dryand, while frost has stopped operations in some districts,in others work has been proceeding satisfactorily.   Sofar the winter has been favourable on the whole.   Farmers are finding difficulty in disposing of theirpotatoes.   The situation in this respeot will soon be serious because farmers count on getting a large part oftheir potato otooks away before the press of&apos; spring v/orkcomes on.   As a matter of fact many farmers, at presenthave succeeded in disposing of only a small proportion oftheir large stocks.   Complaints are also being received about Oats.   Themarket price is considerably below the maximum, and farmersstate that Foreign Oats axe quoted in Southern Markets at prices considerably over the naximum, while the price inSootland of Home grown oats has fallen seriously.   More-over, thore are difficulties in the way of getting away-anyoats sold.   In these circumstances, and with the uncertainty as to prices in the future, farmers show reluctance to continue a progressive tillage programme.   Indications at presentpoint to a decreased acreage under oats in Scotland nextyear and an increase in the area under  turnips.(l)___Defence of the Realm Regulation S M.   During the week a compulsory order was issued underDefenoe of the Realm Regulation 2 M (l) (e) requiring theproprietor and oooupier of the Farm of C-lenturk, Wigtown-shire,&apos; to cultivate and crop 56 acres with oats.(2)   allocation of Sulphate of Ammonia *   The allocation between merchants in Scotland of the out-pit ot Sulphate of Ammonia for the last of the periods(March - May) in which the Fertilisers Prices Order 1918operates was made during the past week.   152 licencescovering a distribution of 9,700 tons have been issued.(3)   Export of Fertilisers.
