f                                    IX/ Or       Aw  *r *-v^j   -                ;  /.;..,,..;;;  - ^           /   382  ^^ ^^^J^Z^^9 President of the Looal Government Board.          I  think an immediate deoislonof the War Cabinet isneoeBsary to determine which. ItelJaxtment ia to be responsiblefor dealing  with the questions whioh arise under the legisla-tion dealing with Increase of Hent and Mortgage InterestRestriction.          In my Memorandum G.T.6836 I explained that thematter is not one which properly falls within the jurlsdic-tion of the Looal Government Board,  The Board is concernedwith the provision of Houses for the working classes.  Thelegislation now in question imposes neither powers norduties on looal authorities;  it is definitely designed toapply to classes other than the working classes;  and itregulates the contractual relations between individual members ef the oommunity.  On all these grounds the matter is one with whioh the Local Government Board is not theappropriate department to deal.  In view of the fact thata good deal of correspondence is coming to the Board largely because no other department has beon charged with the dutyof dealing with the matter, I shall be glad if a decision ofthe Cabinet could be given to settle which department should deal with the question.          Per the reasons indicated above and in my memorandum G.T.6836 I think that the Home Office is theright department to take charge of the matter.                         C. ADM SON&quot;.                             13.3.19.Local Government Board,    Whitehall, S.W.I. IREASE OF RENT AND MORTGAGE IFTSRBST  (RESTRICTION) BILL.
