6.T, f 9 69(This Docin-n^itt   the Property ofHis bnfa..Government.)11th  March 1919THE NECESSITY FOR A POLICY IN THE BALTIC PROVINCES          The attention of the War Cabinet is requested to thenecessity for the formation of a policy with respect to the baltic provinces.     British men-of-war were sent to the Baltic, at the beginningof December last, on the instructions of&quot; the War Cabinet, but no&quot;definite policy was then formulated.   A political adviser was attached to the staff of the fit A. Commanding the Squadron, and theinstructions which were to govern the R.A. were arranged m con-sultation with the Secretary of State for Foreign Afl&quot;  rs.     These instructions were, in brief, to render Naval assistanceto the  Provinces of Esthonia and Latvia, and to land arms andmilitary supplies if this could be done with advantage to Britishinterests..     Theso instructions have boon carried out.   British naval forces  have captured two Bolshevik Destroyers, and have bombardedBolshevik positions on the coast in co-operation with the Military orces  of the National Governments.   In&apos; the course of these operations  a Light Cruiser built recently at a cost of some 3/4laillion has been lost,  with 11 livies.  Arms and military-&quot;supplieshave  been landed at Reval ana at Libra. .  At Libau, where german troops  are  in power, some of the arms landed by us have been thrown  into the  sea, and the last consignment landed has been saved from  a  similar fate only by their being placed on a cargo steamerin  the  harbour and protected by a largo guard of Lettish troops.     Since  the instructions now in force&quot;were issued, the situation has developed considerably.     ESTHOHI-A, assisted by a Finnish loan,  the services of Finnishvolunteers, the  supply  of British arms, and the active assistanceof  British  ships,  has cleared her territory of Bolsheviks, and isnow keeping them at bay on her frontiers. &apos;  She may nevertheless be  exposed^to a  serious Bolshevik invasion at any time when VaeBolsheviks  cljoose  to concentrate troops for that purpose, and to naval operations towards the end of April when the melting of thoice frees the Bolshevik Naval forces at Kronstadt.     TjATVTA,  where local Bolshevism is more prevalent than inEsthonia, has boon over-run by the Bolsheviks, who are now inpossession  of some 3/4  of the country.   The demoralised German   apaoie  general,    inese  troops  wore  transported byArticles 12 and  13  of the Armistice  Convention were by no meansclear as to whether these  troops  should be permitted to land or no.Instructions were sought from the  Supreme War Council, but^as noneftere received, and  in view  of tho  urgent necessity for making headagainst  the Bolshevik forces, the  troops were permitted to land,and are now engaged in an advance  against Riga.   The Supreme WarCouncil has decided that no further  reinforcements are to be landed,and no supplies  for the troops  at  present in Latvia are to be landed.fas order is  at present being enforced by the British Squadron, and                                                               the
 the German Military Commander has stated that, should permission not he granted for tho supplies to be landed, he will be forced very shortly.to commence, evacuating his troops.  This information has&apos;been communicated to the Supreme -&quot;Jar Council.                                                             .on to                                                              a                                            ,cy laid down by the war Cabinet.     Seeing, however, that the great majority of the information relative to the Baltic Provinces comes irom the Naval Officers who have been and are serving in the Baltic, and that it is upon them that it devolves in the main to execute the policy in that region, the Admiralty rapy perhaps be permitted to.state their reasons for[requesting from the &quot;ar Cabinet a fuller statement of the policy[for the future.   (l)   If the present policy continues, Naval operations on a   considerable scale will be&apos;necessary m May, when the Bolshevik   fleet will he free to move.   It is&apos;necessary to commence   preparation without delay.   (2)   As far as is known at tho Admiralty, the present policy   of assisting the Provinces to maintain their integrity is being   carried out by tho Navy, with assistance in the shape of   Military supplies from Army stores,   A loan has been asked for   by both&apos; countries, so also have food stuffs and coal.   No   action has, as far as is k: own, been taken by the Government   Departments concerriou, except that the Treasury has granted   permission for a supply of 20Q)tons of coal to Esthonia.   (3).   We have no permanent representative either in Esthonia or   Litvia, with the exception of a Military Mission of two junior   Officers and a gentleman connected with  the supply of timber,   who have recently arrived at Libau.   The proper execution of   any policy appears to necessitate the presence of permanent   diplomatic^ commercial  economic, and military representatives   at both capitals in order that we may receive reports as  to   the means whereby ^e can most effectively assist these   countries and to ensure that good use is made of the assist-   ance we render to them.   (4)   tfo are at present in the inconsistent position that while   we are placing every obstacle in  the way  of German assistance   towards defending Latvia against  the Bolsheviks, we are giving   no effective help ourselves  to the Letts, or at any rate&quot;that   vve are not giving them  the nature of help for which they  have   repeatedly asked*   If  the Germans withdraw on account of our   denial of the sea transport necessary for  their maintenance as   a fighting force, the onus will be on us  of having delivered   the country  to the mercy of  the Bolsheviks.  - On  the other   hand the Germans behave&apos;as  n army of occupation and place   every obstacle in the way of  the  organisation of a National   Lettish Force.   (5)   It is natural that requests are constantly made  to   British Naval officers  on  the spot by the National Authorities   of Latvia and Esthonia  for statements as  to.the Allied   intentions and for assistance of  every description.  It isll manifestly injurious  to British National  and  Naval prestige   that such&apos; requests should go  continuously unanswered.   The                                                     admiralty
Admiralty has experienced the greatest difficulty in answeringthese requests, and suggests the formation of a Committee,similar to the Eastern&quot;Committee which advises the Governmenton the policy for the Middle &quot;East, which shall advise upon thepolicy for the Baltic Provinces and review this policy fromtime to time, dealing also with subjects in connection with it which, though of insufficient importance to require TarCabinet decision, affect more than one Department of the State.(6)   If operations take place in May in the Gulf of Petrograd,we must be prepared for losses, both of ships and men.  these losses would be incurred against an enemy with whom we are not even formally at war  and against whom we cannot at present exercise even such fundamental belligerent rights as blockade and capture of merchant vessels.   They would be incurred in pursuit of no definite British interest, and in defence of a cause which is not even being supported by the resources of theState, other than the Naval forces.  It is essential that if our Naval forces are to be required to undertake operations of war, they should do so in pursuance of a definite andcoherent policy.(Sgd)   Sydney 11.
