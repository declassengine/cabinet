ENEMY ALIENS IB BRITISH INDUSTRY.Memorandum hy the Minister of Labour.     I would draw the attention of the War Cabinet toa decision given on the 16th January:-fO-M .b% ,  &quot; *           1    &quot;(a) That all prisoners of war, other than those em-         ployed in agriculture, iron stone mines and timber         supply, should be sent to Prance at the earliest         possible moment, and British labour returned In         their place,     fb) That the Departments retaining prisoners of war in         Agriculture, iron stone mines&apos;and timber supply         should report to the War Cabinet a month hence as         to the then position as regards the possibility *         of releasing these prisoners from the work they         are now erf, aged upon, and that the Ministry of         Labour should endeavour to supply British         substitutes.     fc) That the question of the employment of interned         enemy aliens should be carried forward to the         next meeting, when the Secretary of State for         Home Affairs could be present, and that meantime         he should be asked for a memorandum giving the         extent of the employment and his viewsI would point out that the question of the employment ofPrisoners of war has been raised more than onoe in theHouse of Commons.     The Department learned on the 28th February  thatgeneral Head Quarters in Prance refused to accept the prison-ers from this country, and that nothing had been done in re-gard to removing thorn.     The Secretary of state for War stated in the House ofCommons on March 3rd that the War Office policy is to sendall these prisoners back to Prance and  lenders, with theexception of those engaged in agriculture.   I would pointout that if these prisoners of war are withdrawn without discrimination serious results in certain industries mayfollow, as their work is in certain oases the means of provid-
providing employment for large numbers of workpeople. Iwould therefore suggest that the --far Office should supply the Department with all particulars as to the work atpresent undertaken by these men and that the DivisionalCouncils and local Advisory Committees be consulted as tothe need of retaining such prisoners of war on the work onwhich they are engaged, and as to the possibility - if itis thought necessary   of replacing their labour before they are withdrawn.6,  3. 19.
