Introductory.-Th.ii  following report  has  been compiled from  the  personal observations of 14 British  officers  who visited  various parts of  Germany during the above period to carry out special investigations.     The  chief places visited were  Berlin,  Munich,  Hamburg, Hannover,  Leipzig,, Dresden, Magdeburg  and Cassel.     Of the officers who carried out these investigations, Captain E. W. D. Tennant is: working Director&apos;of C. Tennant, Sons and Co., Limited,  metal and chemical merchants; Lieutenant H. A, Rose is  a barrister  practising  at the English Bar; Captain C.  W. Bell is an employe of an important Indian trading firm; Captain W. Stewart  Roddie is employed in the Treasury.     2. Employment and labour conditions. Unrest and disturbances are diminishing owing to the more stable political conditions, and the firm line adopted by Noske,  the Minister of National  Defence, whose  position has been very much strengthened against the Spartacus  movement  by the large combined  Social Democratic majority in the newly-elected National Assembly.     At the same  time, unemployment, accompanied by an inevitable rise in the cost of living, is on  the  increase.   In Berlin  this  increase is estimated  at  500 a day, the number of unemployed being over 200,000.   In  Hamburg the number  is 72,000, in Munich 32,000 and in Leipzig 22,000;     This great and constant increase in unemployment is due to the rapid demobiliza- tion of the army and of war industries, coupled with the inability of peace industry to get started owing to the dearth of raw materials and coal.  Concomitant causes are      (a.)  Reluctance on the part of capital to embark on fresh enterprise.     (6.)  High prices and wages prevailing.     [c.)  Lack of  will  to work on  the part of  the  workers partly due to idleness and           the hio;h unemployment grants, partly to the physical  and mental inertia.           engendered by malnutrition.     This increase in unemployment forms the most dangerous element in the  present situation, especially where the large industrial centres are concerned&apos;.   Unemployment and hunger are the  chief predisposing causes of  Bolshevism, and if these are  removed, there is no chance of Bolshevism gaining foothold in Germany.     3. Coal and transport. All over Germany, except actually in the coalfield areas,. industry is stagnant and shutting down  altogether owing to the lack of coal.  The Silesian and Saar  Valley coal  supplies have  been entirely cut  off; coal  is still being raised in Westphalia, but over a  million tons are waiting at  the pit mouth for lack of transport facilities.    Railway transport has  been crippled  throughout  the country owing to the enormous quantity of  rolling stock lost since last November.   To the number  handed over under the terms of the Armistice must be added a great quantity abandoned and lost  on  all fronts, especially  in the  East, since last November.   This applies more especially to locomotives.  At the  same time, the facilities for repairing locomotives have decreased considerably owing to  the lack of essential raw materials.   Throughout Germany the average percentage  of locomotives  undergoing repair  has increased  from. lfl to 40 since August, 1914.    In the Hannover railway district the number of locomotives in peace time was 1,800,.of which 1,450 were in continual  use;  at the time of the  Armistice 1,300 were  on.

charge, and  on 6th February, 1919, only 850  remained, of which 35 to 40  per  cent.were worn out and incapable of repair,   Many of the best heavy locomotives have  hadto bo handed  over to the  Allies,  consequently the passenger  traffic has had  to bereduced to 29 per cent, of the normal.     The  transport difficulties in the north east of Germany have  been still furtherenhanced by the cessation of the coasting  trade between the  Baltic and  North  Seaports since the Armistice.     4.  Food. The shortage of staple articles of food throughout the  country is  such that the mass of the population  are living upon rations  which,  while  maintaining  life,are  insufficient  to nourish  the  body adequately.   Mothers and  young children are particularly  affected.   Malnutrition has increased  the  mortality and diminished the birth-rate;  it has given rise to  new  diseases (e.g., war  oedema  and  &quot; mangold wurzeldisease &quot;), besides aggravating the previously known ones.     It is difficult to confirm the accuracy of  the official  statements as to the dates onwhich the present food stocks will be exhausted.  These dates vary for different districts in proportion to the local  transport and agricultural conditions ;. Saxony, for instance,is in a particularly unfortunate  position,  being  an  industrial district cut off from hernormal agricultural resources.     In general,  the  following  terminal  dates  given  by &apos;the Central Food  Office inJBerlin are generally correct:           Breadstuffs ...     ...    ...     ...            ...   Beginning of April, 1919.          Potatoes   ...............&apos;   ...   End of May, 1919.          Fats.....................End of March, 1919.          The meat ration can be continued indefinitely  at the cost of slaughtering all              milch cows and breeding stock.     In Saxony,  however, the official  date  for  the cessation of potato  stocks is themiddle  of February, in Bavaria the end of February, and  in Hamburg the end of March.     The  above estimate of the continuance of the  meat ration  seems to  be optimistic,considering that in Hamburg and Hannover,  cows in calf, milch cows and draught oxenare being already slaughtered, as well as 8-day calves.     Given normal weather conditions  during 1919, the  coming  harvest is expected to yield only half the average pre-war crop.     5.  General conclusions. The general impression of  all the visiting officers is thatthe need for  revictualling  Germany is really urgent.   The  country is  living on  itscapital as regards food supplies, and  either famine  or Bolshevism, probably both, wjllensue before  the next harvest, if help from outside -is not  forthcoming.   The  need  forfats is especially urgent.     The  present  social and political  condition of Germany is sufficiently stable to guarantee the orderly distribution of food under the existing rationing machinery.     On the other hand, while Germany is still  an  enemy country, which has not yet4signed peace terms, it would be inadvisable to remove the  menace of starvation  by atoo sudden and abundant supply ot food stocks.   This menace is a  powerful  lever  for negotiation at an important moment.   It is still impossible to gauge  the  period withinwhich Germany&apos;s military power could revive, although there is no immediate danger onthis score.   The allotment  of foodstuffs  should be carefully controlled,  but, provided they are handed over to the  authorized representatives  of the  central government atthe port of entry or  front/ier station, there  seems  no reason for anxiety as to  their ultimate equitable distribution.
