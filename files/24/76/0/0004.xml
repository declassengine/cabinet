BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES.

Report for week ending 25th February, 1919.

PART I. - Food Production Department.

The Weather and Condition of Crops.

In most parts of the country snow and sleet fell at the beginning of the week. This was followed by a rise in temperature accompanied in many parts by heavy rain which was unable to penetrate the frostbound soil.  As a consequence there are extension areas of land under water in the Fen district, and in Norfolk and Suffolk. There are floods also in the Thames Valley, and in ?, Worcester, Gloucester and Herefordshire.

Threshing ha a been hindered  by the wet weather, and, except on the drier soils in a few counties,   cultivation work is at, a stand-still. In Yorkshire a limited number of farmers are seeding by means of the press drill.

The recent  sharp frosts have severely cut the wheat plants in the Fens, but elsewhere wheat is looking wall,   wall. In ? ? sheep flocks ara  suffering from the continued wet weather, and some of the ewes are very weak.

LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION.

Work of Agricultural Executive Committees.

Ploughing up clover leys. The Board have made with regard to a number of counties during the past year Orders requiring the ploughing up of land used for the cultivation of glant sainfoin, clovers or mixtures  of temporary, grass seeds, except in cases where the Agricultural Executive Committee considered it advisable to issue a licence for the land to continue to be so used. In view, however, of the  great scarcity of  hay and the high cost of seeds mixtures at the present time the Board have now addressed a letter, to those counties concerned asking them  to exercise very careful discretion in requiring the ploughing up of satisfactory  clover leys over one year.

Malt for home browing. The Board have recently received a number of enquiries as to whether facilities  will be given this year to farmers and farm labourers to obtain malt for the home brewing harvest beer. In 191? arrangements were made between the Board the Ministry of Food whereby, is those counties where home brewing ? an established custom, malt oould be procured for the purpose by obtaining permits from the Agricultural Executive Committees, and in 1918 the same procedure was followed with regard to those persons who had  obtained permits in 1917. The Board, however, feel that it is desirable that those farmers and others who, prior to the restriction being imposed, were accustomed to brew their own beer for harvest purposes, should be able to obtain a reasonable cupply of malt this season. The Board have accordingly addressed a letter to the Ministry of Food expressing the hope that the Ministry would agree to return to the practice adopted in 1917 of allowing permits to be granted at the discretion Of  the Executive Committee in those counties where home brewing is customary and have pointed out to the Ministry that the limitations imposed last year have created considerable feeling among farmers who had no need to apply for permits in 1917 and who were consequently debarred from obtaining them in 1918. It is interesting to note that the total quantity of malt for which permits were granted in 1917 was only 6,500 quarters.
Cultivation of Farms. The Somerset Executive Committee were authorised in June 1917 to take possession of the arable part (144 acre) of a farm it Abbotts  Leigh as there no other way of getting the land cultivated so as to increase the food supply of the country. The stabling necessary for the work of cultivation was also taken over. The Committee reported last month that 37 acres of the land had been I sold to an experienced farmer and stated their intention of withdrawing from possession in his favour. The Board approved this procedure and the Committee have new furnished a statement of the expenditure and receipts in relation to the land in question:  the result of the Committee&apos;s occupation is highly satisfactory as the balance sheet shows a total profit of  £262.

Determination of Tenancies. During the week 4 Orders have been made by the Board determining tenancies on account of bad farming is respect of 354 acres. In one of these cases the farm, which is situate at Shifnal, had been inspected by the Committee in spring 1914 and was found to be in an absolutely neglected condition swing to the want of capital and capacity of the tenant. The agent of the property was communicated with and he undertook to insist upon the proper cultivation of the farm. The Committee however have now reported that no  improvement has taken place and that the farm is in a worse state than before. The Board have accordingly determined the tenancy and the Order will take effect according to the usual procedure under the Corn  Production (Amendment) Act, 191?.

Arbitration on a Cultivation Order. The first arbitration case in Cornwall on an Order for the breaking up of grass land was heard recently. The arbitrator&apos;s decision was that the change of cultivation was desirable, in the interest pf food production and the occupier of the land was accordingly directed to pay the whole of the  costs, including the arbitrator&apos;s fee and expenses £15.16.6. and solicitor&apos;s costs. The appellant had engaged a solicitor and the Committee were therefore allowed to do so also.

Allotments. In Salop the Executive Committee have been authorised to take possession of a piece of accommodation land at Shifnal and to let it to the Parish Council for allotments of which there is a great scarcity in that part. In Somerset the Committee have taken possession with the authority of the Board of 5 acres of land at Ashill which they intend letting to the Parish Council for allotments which are urgently needed.

In Stourbridge 12 acres have been acquired by the Local Authority for the purpose of allotments, and under the Small Holdings and Allotments Act 11 other authorities have acquired altogether 39 acres which will provide 474 allotments. Reports of the satisfactory cultivation of gardens have been received from Bedworth in Warwickshire where 75 of the 2,000 householders are taking an active interest in the cultivation of their gardens which average 10 poles in extent.

HORTICULTURAL DIVISION.

Fruit Section. A visit has been paid to Holland for the purpose of ascertaining the possibility of obtaining fruit tree stocks for importation into this country. There has been a keen demand in Holland for stocks during the autumn and winter, much of the supply having been bought for the Scandinavian countries, which are willing to pay very high prices to make certain that their requirements will be met. Most of the stocks raised in the nurseries in Holland have been sold and high prices are being asked for stocks still on hand, which the British trade is apparently unwilling to pay. It has been pointed out to the trade that even at the high prices the scarcity of fruit stocks in the world is so great that it will  probably pay to buy, and that if countries like Norway, Denmark and Sweden are prepared to purchase, the British trade ought to be able to do so at a profit.


          The Dutch trade  is very  anxious that the restrictions onreports  of nursery stocks  into this  country  shall &quot;be removed as early as possible.          Applications are being received for demonstration courses inthe canning kitchen, one being from  a demobilised officer who is con-sidering taking up the. work as a commercial  undertaking,     T^l^^ll^^^^\zQ^^Ai^S.S&apos;   The 3a st Suffolk Education Commit tohave  informed the Board that they  have formed a Horticultural Sub-Ccin/committee, on which have been co-cpted seine  of the most active membersof the present Sub-Committee of the  Agricultural Executive CommiItees.          A deputation from the Surrey Horticultural Sub-Committeehas expressed the hope that the present Horticultural Sub-Commit teewhich had gained the complete confidence of  the allotment holdersshould be continued,     Instruction and Advice.   An  inspection has been carried out of20 small holdings at Lildenhall, Suffolk, where the results have beenvery poor indeed.   Only straw crops and potatoes are grown, and themen are  simply slaving owing to their lack of knowledge of intensivecultivation and of ordinary business methods;   The only thing which;wftll lift them out of their apathy is a model holding run ono omme r c ial 1 ine s ,          A very successful conference was held at Truro,  which wassttended by the Department Is Technical Inspectors, and at which theproblems peculiar to cultivation in  Cornwall were fully discussed:.                             TECHNICAL DIVISION.     Inspection of Land.   Three farms in Bast Suffolk have beeninspected in connection with an application made by the AgriculturalExecutive Committee for authority  to enter into possession.   The firstfarm, of 69 acres (including 15 acres permanent grass) was in a foulcondition when occupied by the present tenant throe years ago-,  and hasbeen worked on a system of shallow ploughing, repeated corn cropping,and inadequate manuring,   The arable land has consequently remainedfoul, and the tenant, whose only employee at present is a son aged 22,is unlikely to make any progress with the cleaning of the land until he secures additional labour and live stock,   If the ExecutiveCommittee can offer help in this direction it would be a reasonablecourse tA adopt;  otherwise there would seem no alternative but toenter into possession and clean the  land.          The second farm,pf 80 acres, is practically derelict, thewhole area, with the exception of  two fields of 12 acres,  being awilderness of bent,  docks and thistles.   The two fields referred toare in poor condition,  and produced  light crops last year;   theremainder has apparently not been touched since 1914,   The land is toogocd to be left in its present state;  the adjoining farms on either side are well cultivated and produce good crops.    lbs existing tenancydees not expire till Michaelmas,  1920,  and it seems a clear case for determing the tenancy and authorising the Committee to enter intopossession.          The third farm consists of 105 acres of arable land and 25acres pasture.   The grass is impoverished and needs building up withbasic slag,   The arable land,  though by no means as clean or as wellfarmed as it  might be,  is hardly such as to warrant the dispossessionof the tenant.   He appears to have grown fair crops, and he shouldbe able, with such help and guidance as the Committee are able tooffer, to carry on and even improve the condition of his holding.
      Seed Pressings ,aa. protection,, against, bird a.    Szper line nt 0  on/this  subject  have  for  some  time&apos;been, in progress  at Rothamsted.    The results  obtained up  to September last were communicated to farmers by a press  notice  issued  in  time  to be  of use in  connection with autumn sowings ,    It was  then stated  that acetone tar, procurable from the Ministry  of Munitions, v/as  the best  form of tar that had  been tested, but  that  ordinary  coal tar,  suitably thinned - down with paraffin, might alsc be employed.   The  investigation is  still being continued, and  in particular  attempts  have been made  to overcame the harmful effects  on germination produced by some of the  dressings that afford useful protection.  It  is  found that treatment with lime overcomes this  harmful  effect  to a  considerable extent,  though whether  the protective effect  is thereby diminished can only  be ascertained  by larger scale  trials.   Arrangements  for these  have been made.                            Women&apos;s Branch.           The present  number cf the  Land Army  is  11,430,  an analysis of   rhich shows -                32  lent to the  Flax Production-Department,              445    &quot;    M  11  Timber Supply     &apos; tt                98  in Training  Centres,            10,553  on farm v-ork,              129  on tractor work,                6  waiting for  training,              161  in depot,              206  in their  own homes. The  last  two  items are mainly  composed of women between terms of employment, on  leave or  ill.           From  the reports  received  from various  parts of the country,  it is  probable  that the demand for woman labour this year will be greater than   last.   The  demand for skilled  women is increasing rapidly,  but  it 1B impossible  to say v/hether this is anything but  a fluctuation as  it  may  decrease v/hen  a larger number of men are     . . fiemcbilised ,    Reports vary on this  point;  in some counties  the present  demand  is  considered temporary, in others of a mere permanent character.           A considerable  shortage of thatchers is revealed in Berkshire and  seven women have offered themselves far training in the county. If these are  successful,  a  further demand is anticipated and  provided the  women can be obtained to take, up this work,  increased trainings will be  given.           In a  report  received on the last quarter&apos;s work in  Pembroke, it is stated that  the  farmers  in the county have  been most appreciative  of the  women1s work - one employer making the  statement that the Land Girls  had  been their mainstay during the stress and strain of the War.      Women&apos;s Institutes.     Women1s  Institutes are nothing  if not inventive.   In some villages  the difficulty of a meeting place has been very great, and the  Ueasham (Durham) V/omen1 s Institute has therefore.fitted up  an old  railway carriage as an Institute room, where among ether  things  they  have a Library and  Magazine Club. This Institute  has also  had a  War Loan Association which collected  42Ci.   A produce  show and  exhibition was held in August, and the Institute&apos;e schemes  for  the coming year include the appointment of a village nurse.           Twelve new Institutes were started during the week, making a total of 875.

In consequence of the higher priority given ta   agriculture in the order cf demobilisation the rate of release of   agriculturists has increased during the past seven days to over 4,000   per day.   This is a  satisfactory increase and if the present rate of^ release is maintained the present serious shortage of labour will te   some extent be relieved.   It is feared, however, that the retention.   of agriculturists who jained after the 1st January, 1916, for the Army   of Occupation may cause very serious inconvenienoe, as many of the   men who were called up during 1918 were the ^ey1 men left en farms.   The total number of agriculturists demobilised sinoe the date of the   Armistice is 83,991*        Seldier Labour.   A further 6,312 soldiers of Agricultural   Ctmpanieo were demobilised during the week, bringing the strength ef   these Companies down to 47,614.                               CULTIVATION DIVISION,             The sale of surplus tractors and implements continues.   The   prices realised during the past week were satisfactory.             During the two weeks ended 14th February, 8,363 acres were   pleughed, 37 acres were orose ploughed and 7* aoree were cultivated.             During the past week 277 horses were sild at an average   price of  52.   The total number of horses sold to date ie about 3,200.        Steam Tackle.   The acreage covered during the past week is ae   follows:-  Pleughed 69, cultivated 77, mele drained 36.   Tgtal 171   aeres.        Horse and tractor schemes.   Replies are coming in slowly from   Committees setting out their proposals for the liquidation of these   schemes:  but the Committees are actively considering the matter and   many enquiries upon points of difficulty have been received and   answered.   In enly one instancy (Hertford) has a suggestion been made   thai, the schemes should be continued after the end of September, an*   in that ease the suggestion is put forward, with a view to safeguarding   the interests of the engineer contractors.                              COMMERCIAL DIVISION.        Lime.   The increase in the cost of wages and coal is sending up   the price cf burnt lime in many districts to an extent which is likely   to deter farmtrs from liming their land.   An increase in the number   ftf plante fftr grinding limestone would to Borne extent help te check   this increaee and at the same time provide a substantial supply if   lime.   It is preposed to select some suitable works for the erection   ef plants on terms of repayment of capital outlay by a reyalty en the &apos;  $atput and te lay a scheme for this before the Treasury.   The output   from a single plant may be estimated at from lt-15,000 tons per annum,   so that the erection of a relatively small number of plants would have   a substantial effect on the total supply of lime.        Binder Twine.   Complaints liave been received of Unemployment   ewing to the stoppage of work at several binder twine factories and&apos; r  representations are being made to the Board of Trade and Ministry   ef Labour with a view to the suspension of licences for the import of 1  binder twine from America.   If the makers would guarantee to make   additional quantities in this country at a reasonable price there   would be no great objection to a suspension of licei^es with a view   to prevent unemployment.   It would be easy later ftrthe season to   tbtain additional supplies from abroad should there be any evidence   if a shortage.   The openings for export appear to be very limited;   but it has been suggested that sot:se additional trade can be done if   the export restrictions were removed, and the War Trade department 4   has accordingly been advised tt remove binder twine ifreii the   prohibited list with a view to preventing this restriction being    A   alleged as a causa of uneuploymCnt.                 v               fj
     Seed Potatoes.   The difficulties which growers areexperiencing in marketing potatoes of the 19K! crop are having a depressing effect on the demand for &quot;seed&quot; for planting thisseason.   It is in the interests of potato cultivation in 1919 thatthe uncertainty in the minds of growers regarding claims forabnormal wastage and their responsibility in disposing of surplus&quot;chats&quot; should be removed as soon as possible *          The sale of &quot;seed&quot; of immune varieties grown by the board under contract in Scotland is proceeding steadily but contractorsare finding considerable difficulty in obtaining an outlet for thev/arc owing to the restrictions imopesed &quot;by the scheme of distribution.     Seed Oats.   As far as can bo estimated at present, the board with the assistance of the Royal Commission on wheat Supplies have secured about 16,000 tons out of the 20,000 tons required by theFrench Government, but the result of the teats is not yet known inall cases.   It io anticipated that there wi 1,-1 be no difficulty in securing the remainder of the seed oats in time for delivery in france during the coming season,   A cargo of Jver COO tons leftLiverpool last week and another cargo of about 600 tons has leftStockton-cn-Tees this week.     Wart piseaseiof Potatces.   The Beard ;f Agriculture forScotland have raised certain objections to the original draft cfthe Order by which it is proposed to control the export ofsusceptible &quot;seed&quot; from Scotland to England.   The draft order isbeing reconsidered with a view to mooting so far as is possible thewishes of the Board of Agriculture for Scotland.     Testing of Seeds Order.   Representations have been made by somecf the Wholesale Seed Merchants that, owing to the late deliveries of see&apos;1 this season, they should be authorised to despatch consignmentsto their retail oustomers in advance cf the declaration as togermination, purity, etc., which in the ordinary way, should be madeat or before the time cf sale cr delivery.   This matter ioreceiving careful consideration.

A meeting convened  by Local Authorities is being held to-day at Birmingham,  to discuss the best  means of dealing  with  the  rat menace.   Local Authorities within approximately 50  miles of  Birmingham, Farmers&apos;  Clubs, and-ethers,  have teen invited to send  representatives; and Mr. Read,  who is to attend, will advise on  the subject generally.     -Leg.at.ion. Representations from  different quarters continue to reach&quot;the Bo&amp;id emphasising the urgent  need of  such  legislation as weuld give the Beard adequate powers in connection with rat^-destruction.      Exhibition.   The proposed scheme  to establish  an exhibition  at the Zoological Gardens has been approved by the  Zoological Council.      Poisons.   The Foreign Office  have undertaken to  obtain  inform- at ion from H.M. British Consuls on the  Mediterranean with a view  to obtaining particulars of available  supplies of  Scilla  Maritimus (Squills).           An experimental test of sulphur dioxide gas  by  the  Clayton Gas Company has been arranged for the 27th inst. (wind conditions permitting), at Reading.           An experiment with chlorine gas on corn stacks  was  made at iii che Id ever,  Plants,  by military  officers.    The results ware net satisfactory,   Few rats  were killed by gas  in the stacks and apparently the chlorine had damaging effect on  the grain  and  staoks.

  had  been Bcomnended  by  the  Board  to  the  Ministry  of  Labour, enquiring  as to  the present  position.   Replies  are  coming  in  very  satisfactorily,  and  it is found  that in a good number  of cases  the men have actually  been released  and  are again at the  fishing.   The despatch of  thesefi enquiries is continuing in  respect  of  both Naval  and Military  applications *            The  total  number  of  fishing  vessels already released ^r  about  to be reloaded at English and  Welsh  ports by the Admiralty and  the  Ministry of  Shipping is 570 (357 trawlers and 213 drifters).

The applications are provisional  and  subject to the decision of the Board to  re-open  the IJpney  Depot.  Prices have not  yet  been submitted  to  applicants, but it  is not  probable that  a  slight  increase in  cost  will have the effect ef causing  any  serious cancellation of   orders.          The safest Byfleet Eel Corporation has now placed orders amounting to eight hundred thousand eels in all.                      INTljLLICTCVj DIVISION.     Education Branch.   The return of a third member of the staffthis week restores the clerical staff of the Branch to pre-war strength and enables the delayed examination of claims for grants andsome other arrears of work which could not be undertaken by thetemporary staff to be proceeded with.    -\          A misleading notice which appeared in The Smallholder,,announcing that free sittings of eggs were being distributed by theBoard, has, as might be expected, brought forth a large number *fapplications.          The correspondence of the Branch is increasing owing to  &apos;the greater attention which the reconstruction of agricultural education is now receiving.     Publications Branch.   The number of applications for ordinaryissues of the leaflets was 1,240, in response to which 4,885 copieswere despatched.          In addition, 15,275 copieB of the leaflets were despatched to applicants for supplies in bulk for distribution.          Applications were received for 414 copies of the threeBound Volumes of Leaflets, and 270 copies of the pamphlet &quot;How to manage an Allotment&quot; were sent out.

Flax Production Branch.  The output of dressed seed for  week ending 20 th February was 3,560 cwts. as against an out-put of  3; 950 owtSv last week.   The  decrease is mainly due to bad  weather,  which prevented threshing operations at all Centres,  and to the constant breakdowns of engines.           All the Deseeding Stations are now in operation,  the last tf* commence work (Bury  St. Edmunds) having started on 25th inst. As, however, the time allowed for the dispatch of seed to Belfast has been extended, there is little doubt that the deseeding programme will be completed in time to enable the received amount of seed to be shipped.           Regular shipments are now being made from all Centres.           Dew-retting will shortly commence.

All  men have  put in a  full week&apos;8 work, with the exception   of  some of the settlers who have been working on their own holdings.       Heath Hill. Owing to snow, thaws, and rain, no  field work has   been possible.    The farming operations have  consisted in  carting  swedes   and roots to the yard, brushing hedges, and two days&apos; wheat  threshing.   The wheat and winter oats, though  very  late,  are looking well,  a   slight  covering  of snow protecting them from  the recent severe  frcsto.

The aroa of the forcshoro which it is proposedto reclaim comprises 1,500 acres in four &quot;blocks at Fro 1st on, v/rangle,  fFrisknoy and ,/ainfleet.    The whole of this aroa is at present beingsurveyod for the Board by the Ordnance Survey.   Then the survey is completed, engineering plans will bo prepared.   The site of thehutments has been decided upon and arrangements are being made withthe  /ar Office to supply huts and equipment for the accommodation the demobilised soldiers who will be employed on the work.   It isestimated that this scheme will provide employment for 800 men for about twelve months.   Steps are being taken by the Legal Adviserwith a view to the acquisition of the land.          A letter has been received from the Air Ministry, statingthat they wish to retain the whole of the Freiston area as it is oneof the few-;places where training in low flying and firing at troops on the ground - essential to the training of the R...LF. - can becarried tut.   As this would mean the loss ef 500 acres of the beststrip cf  $claimable foreshore, the Air ministry have been askedwhether it would not be possible for them to carry ,$ut their trainingseawards Of the wall it is proposed to erect and allow the Board toreclaim the landward strip.  Berth Bo  (Cardigan).  The total area tf this bog is approximately4,500 acres.   It  is divided fairly clearly inta two portions, one efv/hich is peat and the other warp land.   This area has been in processof survey by the Ordnance Survey since the 27th January.    .*hen the survey is completed a decision will be come to whether to acquire thearea or net.   From the facts so far available it appears to beprobable that it will be acquired.   It is proposed to confinepractical work, at first at any rate, to the warp land of the northernhalf, comprising 2,300 acres, though steps will probably be taken toacquire the whole area,          An essential part of this  scheme is the inclusion of theexisting railway embankment as the sea wall of tho larger part ofthe area v/hich it  is proposed to reclaim.   At present, ertrome hightides pass over the embankment.   It will therefore be necessary toraise it at certain places.    The Board1s engineer has been in touchwith tho engineer of the Railway Company, who does not oppose thoproposal from an engineering point cf view and the Board are now inofficial communication with the Directors of the Railway Company inthe matter.  Upper Vaenor and parcel CanolVi (Cardigan).   This is an area of 80acres which is at present uncultivated owing to floods from the RiverRheidol.   It has been surveyed during the past week and a report andscheme of reclamation are now being prepared for consideration.  Barrage of the River Dovey (Cardigan).  The County Councils concernodjhave submitted a proposal that the estuary cf the River Dovey shouldbe enclosed by an embankment, with sluices to prevent the ingress of sea water and to allow the river water to escape between tidos.   Thoomban.kmunt would carry a railway and a road.   Thu works undur thisscheme are estimated roughly to cost  200,000 - probably a lowestimate - and tf protect 0,700 acres of agricultural land fromflooding.
