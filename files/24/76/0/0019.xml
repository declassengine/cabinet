CTMoka^ent is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]            POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT,                       FOREIGN OFFICE.                                      ITALY /008.  MEMORANDUM          ONITALIAN AFFAIRS.                        The Transition from War to Peace.    THERE has been great outcry from the industrialists over the obstacles in  theway of resumption of business,  due, as is alleged, to the want of capacity and chronicbureaucratic dilatoriness of the  various technical departments.  These grievances were very frankly expressed at a great meeting of the manufacturers of Northern Italy heldat Bergamo at the end of January, which demanded (l) abandonment of the Governmentcoal monopoly it would  be worth paying  higher prices in  order  to  get  i id of officialdelays and red-tape  methods;  (2) immediate improvement of means of transport repairs to rolling-stock  have been neglected, and what is serviceable  is too largelymonopolised by the War Office;  (3) facilities for obtaining raw materials; (4) payment by the Government of its debts on  account of war material supplied.   At the same timethe demobilised men  are complaining that  the Government  has made no provision forthe supply of civilian clothes, of delays in the payment of pensions, and in the granting of the promised life insurances  for combatants, of the continued scarcity and clearnessof food, &amp;c.    The  new Government is said to be getting to work.  Some confidence is felt in the vice--President  of the Council,  Villa, and  in  the Minister  of the Treasury, Stringher,both of whom are said to  be hard workers.   Villa&apos;s position he  has been  relieved ofthe Transport Department, and  is free to devote himself to  the more practical side ofOrlando&apos;s duties is  taken to  mean  that he will  devote  himself to securing betterco-operation between the different departments.     However, as the first  step towards remedying the evils  complained of is a rapid  and extensive demobilisation, and as the  forward  policy Italy is following both in europe and Africa stand in  the way of this (perhaps also the fear of internal  trouble) it is improbable that the Government will have much success.  The question of demobilisationseems to  have mainly determined Signor Nitti&apos;s  resignation.   Without the support ofcertain strong groups of  industrialists he  could  hardly hope for a successful launching of the new loan.  To obtain this support a large measure of  demobilisation was requiredin order to clear the way for a resumption  of manufacturing activity,  and this he couldnot persuade his colleagues to sanction.     It appears that the Government have  been induced to drop the coal  monopoly (the&quot;Times,&quot; 15th February, 1919).     Certain measures have been  taken to  relieve the &quot;congestion in ports like Genoa(where at the end of January there were 450,000 tuns of goods awaiting distribution),and to facilitate movement of commerce.  Sea transport&quot; across the  Adriatic is being,or has been, organised in order  to  relieve the congestion on the railways of Lombardyand Veuetia (for the  country beyond the  Piave only one bridge was practicable, over which  seventeen  trains a  day  were  passing  almost  entirely for  military transport).Lines of  steamers are plying (or just about  to ply) between  Genoa and Palermo,  andGenoa and Trieste the tariff being the same aa that for overland transport.  special facilities  for quick transport by  rail of fruits from South Italy were being arranged  for,but the  quantity of rolling-stock  and engines under repair, the difficulties in  the  wayof repair  and the  demands of the army  made improvement in  commercial transportextremely difficult.^     The  scarcity of transport  is,  however, only one of the obstacles in the way of a return to peace-time trade conditions.  Another is  the   necessity  for  maintainingGovernment  control of exchange  and the  credit arrangements made with the  Alliesuntil a normal balance between imports of  foreign securities  and expenditure abroadon raw materials and food can  be  re-established.  These difficulties  were explained at    * De Nava, Minister of Transport, to a section of  the Reconstruction Commission, January 27.       [1130]-189CONFIDENTIAL,t [February 18, 1919.]      (11057)
some length recently by the Minister of Food, Signor  Crespi, in an interview with  the&quot; Corriere della Sera,&quot;  (22nd January),     Signor Crespi in the same interview also  discussed a subject which has recived  agood deal of  attention in the Italian  press, viz., the pooling  of war-debts.  He hud&apos;, hesaid, suggested the  plan  to the Allied Ministers  so  long ago as November (before it-was brought up  in the French  Chamber by M. Stern),  and it had been favourablyreceived  bv them.   Some of them  had  already evolved  plans of their own.   SignorCrespi proceeded  to outline his scheme.   The &quot; single financial front &quot; being the naturalcomplement of the  &quot;single  military front.&quot; all sums obtained from  the enemy by wayof reparation  or  indemnity  should   be  paid into  a common  Inter-Ally  chest, -whichshould also receive the proceeds of certain taxes to  be determined by the Conference,and levied on all  States Allied, neutral, and enemy receiving benefit as a consequenceof the sacrifices made by&apos;the Allies.  Taxes  might, e.g., be  levied  on freights, coal, oronr;iw materials.  From the fund thus established, each of the Allies would be indeinni-fied in proportion to its sacrifices-in the economic sense-account being also taken ofrelative national wealth.  Provision would be made for interest and sinking fund fromthe proceeds of the universal taxes.                                   Party Politics.     No  date  has yet  been  fixed for the General Elections.   In  press speculations onthe  subject the  end  of  May or beginning  of June is suggested  as  possible.   Thequestion  is complicated by the feeling that the &quot;redeemed&quot;  provinces phould (following the  precedents of 1859 and  1866)  take part in  electing  the new Parliament, whileunder  the existing  provisional regime it is difficult to proceed with  the  necessarypreliminaries   revision of  electoral register  and  delimitations  of  constituencies.Accordingly the date of the  elections must, it is felt, depend  on that of the signature ofthe peace, at present impossible to forecast.   Meanwhile the influence  of the  comingevent  is  seen  in the  composition  of the reconstructed Ministry, in  the re-eiection of party platforms, and the consequent  break-up of the war coalitions the &quot; Pasi-io&quot; andthe t&quot; Unione Parlamentare,&quot; and the beginnings of  new  groupings  determined byattitude,  towards foreign policy and  internal  reconstruction.   A tendency is  noted onthe part  of the further Left-Reformist-Socialists (  supporters of Bissolati) and advancedRadicals  to co-operate with  the  Right  wing  of  the Official  Socialists  in support of&quot;Wilsonian  principles&quot; a&apos;d  in pressing for disarmament   and  abolition of conscrip-tion.   The writer of a leading  article  in the Radical &quot; L&apos;Unita&quot; (1st Februan),  forexample,  emphasises the point that the  division  between  Reformist and  Official orstrictly Marxian  Socialists which took place before  the war  was quite independent ofthe issue which brought about the isolation of the Official Socialists during the war,  thequestion, namely, of neutrality, and  that, now that the  war is over,  there is nothingthat in principle  need prevent the temporary co-operation of  Reformists and Officials forcertain definite ends.   But  the most talked  of development in connection with  theimminence of the elections is the formation of an independent Catholic party, which, by adopting  the title  of &quot; Partita  popolare  italiano,&quot; obviously desires to  advertise itsdemocratic and national character.     Since 1870 the Catholics in Italy have been in  a difficult position.   To take part inthe political affairs of the kingdom was to incur the disfavour, or worse,  of the Vatican,which demanded of the faithful that their attitude should correspond with that  of  the pope, that is, should be one of passive opposition.   It was  summed up in the formula&quot;Ne elettori, ne  eletti.&quot;     This position was  strictly maintained during the  Pontificate  of  Leo XIII, thoughits  disadvatages were increasingly felt, since  it left the  field open for all the enemies ofthe Church the anti-clerical Radicals, Freemasons, and Socialists.  Pius X having as aparish priest  had close experience of these  disadvantages,  took steps  to remedy  thesituation.  Lie established  the  &quot; Unione popolare&quot;  as a  cultural  and  social  organthrough  which the Catholic point of view which might make itself felt in public  affairs.     Survival  of the old  prejudices prevented this  league  from becoming a  regularpolitical party.  The rule &quot; Ne eletti, ne elettori &quot; was only so far modified that Catholicswere permitted to take part in elections in cases where the Catholic vote given for a notanti-clerical candidate  might defeat as open enemy  of  the Church.  The catchphrase inwhich  this modification was  registered was  &quot; Cattolici deputati si,  deputati Cattolicino&quot; (Catholics who are deputies, but not Catholic deputies).     The war came and revealed the falsity of the position.   It became clear..that manyItalian Catholics would not, and could not, accept the tight-jacket of neutrality forced upon
                              t    *  the Pope by the (ecumenical character of  his office.  This truth has been partially and  tentatively recognised by the authorities and official journals of the Vatican during the  war. and now finds formal expression  in the newly-formed Catholic party, &quot; II partitoI  popolare italiano,&quot; which is independent  of the official organisations and  hierarchy of  the  Church, but has not been formed without the cognisance  and approval  of the  Holy See.       The manifesto and  programme of the  new party published  in the Italian press of  the  20th January are Christian Socialist in character.  The programme  ranges  from  &quot;No divorce &quot; to &quot; Votes for women,&quot;  and includes free education in all grades,  recogni-  tion and freedom of organisation for  trades unions, State organisation of all  national  powers of production, decentralisation  of administration and electoral reform.   (The full  programme is given in the War Office &quot; Allied Press Supplement&quot;  to the &quot; Daily review  of the Foreign Press&quot; of the 5th February.)       The launching of the party is the outcome of meetings attended hy various members  of Parliament, provincial and  communal councillors, representatives of working men&apos;s  associations.       The first meeting was  attended by deputies of the Christian Syndicalist group   Bertini, Schiavon. Miglisti, Micheli, and Tovini.       Radical papers are distrustful of  the new party, and regard the title it has chosen  as a piece of camouflage.  They recall the political antecedents of the Catholics their  compact  with Giolitti for the elections of 1911, and point out as a suspicious symptom  the fact  that it is the Nationalist and Conservative press and  not that  of the Left  groups which gives the new party cordial welcome.       The  &quot;Secolo,&quot;  of  the  1st,  February, draws  attention to  the fact that  the  &quot; Confederazione  del  Lavoro&quot;  has,  for the first time in its history, put out a definite  political  programme.   This, says  the &quot; Secolo,&quot; is equivalent to the formation  of a  Labour party and implies a breach with the  Maximalists of the Socialists party.                       The Italian Press and the Peace Conference-ence.       It has been interesting to  notice  the gradual disillusionment of Conservatives and  Nationalists in  Italy as the  proceedings  of the Peace Conference  become  known.  Before the  Conference opened, their  tone  had been one of  knowing  scepticism.   It  would be all a game of bluff, in which,  under cover of phrases  like the  &quot; League of  Nations&quot; or  &quot; Wilsoniau  principles,&quot; each Power  would  seek  to  realise its  own  ambitions.   The speeches of M. Pichon and M. Clemenceau in the French  Chain her on  the 29th December and  the  interpretation put  upon the result of the general  election  in England gave encouragement to this  view, which  appeared in its most outspoken  form  in  the Nationalist  press.  Scepticism  was encouraged also by the language  used  in regard to the League of Nations  by Signor Tittoni  in a speech which lie made at  the closing session of the Colonial Congress (21st January).0       The first shock was given by the resolution of the 25th January, affirming  that  the creation of a  League of Nations must be an integral part of  the Treaty of  Peace;  but it was  the discussion on colonies (28th, 29th, and 30th January) that really opened  the&apos;eyes  of the expansionists.   When  the decision  to place the German colonies under  the League was announced, and the British Prime Minister was found to be supporting  &quot; the thesis of Wilson&quot; against the &quot; thesis of the Dominions,&quot; surprise was great, and  various explanations were suggested.   Was  it really loyalty to democratic principles or  was there,  perhaps, some secret compact concerning Liberty of the Seas ?  (&quot; Giornale  d&apos;Italia,&quot; 1st February.)   It was pointed out that this &quot; unforeseen solution &quot; cut away  the ground from Italy&apos;s  claims under  the  Treaty of 1915  (which promised to Italy  certain desired readjustments in the frontiers of her African colonies in case France or  Great  Britain  gained territory in  Africa  at the expense of the German colonies).  Italys claims must then  be satisfied&quot; on the  basis of &quot;compensation.&quot;   And European,  as well  as extra-European, aggrandisements  must  be taken  into  account.   The  annexation of the Saar  coal-fields  by the French does much  greater violence  to  the  industrial equilibrium of the Latin  Powers than that  of the  Cameroons.  Even  the  Liberal and Democratic press is dissatisfied and anxious as to  how the accepted  solution  will affect the country which is richest in  population  and most  requires outlets for  emigration and sources of raw material.     * The Conference, he said, instead of at once attacking the national, economic, and colonial  questions  which were keeping the peoples in a state of suspense and anxiety, had taken in hand the question of the  League of  Nations.  He himself desired earnestly the  creation of this League, but he could not understand  how it could be made the preface to the Peace Treaty of which it should logically be the corollary.
                                The Italian Colonies.     Apart from the  Conference colonial questions have  recently been receiving more-attention than has been usual in Italy.  The recent conference On colonial affairs, at which the  position  in Tripoli  arid  all Italy&apos;s  programme  of colonial claims were competently and fully discussed, was taken  seriously  by  the press and generally pronounced  a  success.   The  policy  being  pursued  in  Tripoli  appears  to aim at a recovery  of the  territory abandoned  in 1915 rather by means  of pacific penetration than by  force of arms.   The  confidence  of the  formerly  best disposed tribes of Tripolitania  having been  badly shaken by  the  way in  which  they were  left in  the lurch in 1915, the task of recovering their goodwill is an uphill one, but some progress is said to have been made.  At the same  time the military preparations are reported to be on a considerable scale.   Two  columns are  advancing inland one  from  Tripoli, the other from Zuara ready to give armed support, if necessary, to the commissioners charged with the task of peaceful persuasion.   A conflict has already taken place at Zeira (near  the  oasis  of  Zuara) in  which  the  Italians are reported to  have been successful.  In Cyrenaica the task is said  to be  less  difficult owing to the existence there of the now friendly Senussite organisation, representatives of which have recently been paying a visit to Italy.                                  The Jugo-Slavs.     The press campaign against the Jugo-Slavs has been rather less violent since about the 20th January the papers contenting themselves with  giving great prominence to all reports of quarrels and divisions within Jugo- Slavia.o
