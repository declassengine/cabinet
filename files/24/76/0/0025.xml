     1. The Chairman stated that the result of the  deliberations ofthe Conference during the previous week were being considered next morning by a Conference of Ministers under the presidency  of  thePrime Minister,  when  it was  hoped that  a  uniform policy  to befollowed would be adopted.  He added that  before proceeding withthe agenda he  wished to deal  with one  or two points that wereoutstanding from the  Minutes of the previous meetings.Permits and Pass-ports and Informa-tion Bureaus.     2. With  reference to  Minute   4  of  the  Second  Meeting,Mr. Pease stated that the report of the Sub-Committee had alreadybeen drawn up and was in process of circulation among the membersof the Sub-Committee  for  their approval, and  that  it  would  be presented almost immediately.   He added that Mr. Butler was  atpresent indisposed, and that therefore they had been  unable to dealwith the  second part of  the business, which was referred to the Sub-Committee at  the  Third Meeting,  and  that the Sub-committee proposed therefore  to submit their recommendations  regarding theissue of passports and permits without waiting for the remainder ofthe enquiries to be carried out.Basis for Deter-mining Importsfrom Canada.     3.  Mr. Bridgeman said  he had enquired into this matter, and thought that it must be admitted that the basis taken to determine the quantity of imports operated inequitably in the case of Canada. This  had  already been pointed out   to  the Import Restrictions Department, and something  had already  been done to increase the share of imports given to Canada.   Unfortunately, carrying this out had been limited by the fact that this country was under obligations to receive definite quantities  of certain things from Allied and other countries, so that the Canadian imports could not be increased with- out increasing the total imports.  Moreover, the question  had  been raised of the need of protecting industries in this country, and this entailed consultation  with  the  interests  affected.   Pending  this discussion,  the  Import  Restrictions  Department had  felt itself unable to take further action, but an enquiry would  be  conducted into each case, and every effort would be made to  arrange  for larger imports  from Canada.   The Board of Trade thought that there would not he any difficulty in substantially meeting the  Canadianclaim.    Mr. Chamberlain said that  he  understood Canada felt that she was at a disadvantage on account of the basis upon which restrictionson imports  were  settled.    Canada alleged that  the actual basis handicapped her in two ways.  It took  no account of the present potentialities of  new industries  developed during  the war  ; and yet the year chosen as the basis being one when Canada was at warand her chief  competitor was at peace, it  was equally unfavourable to her pre-war industries.  Canada of course would like to be treatedon a pre-war basis for her pre-war industries,  and  on a war basis forher industries developed during the war,  but as  matters  stood she had neither of these advantages.    Sir Albert Stanley said that the question of fixing a  basis wasnot so simple as it appeared, as  it had to be looked  at from  the pointof view  of different countries, and, if a favour was shown to  one,another  was quick to  expect the same.   He agreed that it was amatter which wanted very careful consideration, but he hoped  thatno definite decision would be come  to on the point, as  the  Board ofTrade had the matter well in mind.
Export of Eailway       5.  The Chairman drew attention to the fact that the export ofMaterial.           new railway material had been  prohibited quite recently, almost                  immediately after the complete removal  of all restrictions had been                  announced.                      Sir Herbert Walter stated  that he  was unable  to  make  any                  statement to the Conference at that meeting, but that he hoped to do                  so at the following meeting.   He added  that the object of placing a                  restriction on the export of new railway material was that at present                  we could not manufacture sufficient for our own requirements in this                  country.                   .   Sir Albert Stanley stated  that, according to his information,                  locomotive  manufacturers  in this county were not  at  the present                  time fully occupied.                                        - SE,                      Mr.  Chapman stated  that  the change of policy to  which the                  Chairman had alluded originated through an error.                      The announcement issued early in January, removing all restric-                  tions on  railway material, was made, inadvertently,  to apply to all                  railway material, instead of only to second-hand material.   Later on                  a mistake  was discovered,  and was unfortunately rectified by a                  further announcement to the effect that the restrictions removed only                  referred, to second-hand material and not to new material.                      It  was decided :                       That all restrictions  on the exportation of railway material,                           whether new or second-hand, should be removed forthwith.Paper Control.           4. Sir Albert Stanley stated that, in his opinion, the control of                 paper  should be abolished at once.   He  fully realised  that  the                 question of allowing paper or  paper pulp to be freely imported from                 Scandinavia  presented  difficulty from the Treasury  point of view,                 but he thought  that the restriction on that import and the removal                 of restrictions on its importation from Canada and the United States                 of America would not have any useful effect, as by far  the greater                 proportion of our imports of this commodity came from Scandinavia.                 He favoured  the removal  of  control  as  quickly as possible, with  a                 view  to  encouraging  traders to  rely  upon   themselves, and  he                 thought that this principle should  be  adopted  in the  case  of paper.                 He was  aware that such action would hit paper manufacturers in                 this country  very hard, but he considered that this was a lesser evil,                 provided assistance could be given to manufacturers  in very special                 cases where  the results of the proposed  policy showed  it to be                 desirable.                      Lord Emmott observed that if the War Cabinet accepted  the                 recommendations of his  Sub-Committee  the difficulty of rectifying                 the rate  of exchange would be modified, owing to the possibility of                 exporting more commodities to Sweden and other blockade countries.                     Ljord Ernie enquired  whether the increase in employment in                 trades  manufacturing  paper-made   articles   resulting  from  the                 removal of restrictions on the  import of paper would counterbalance                 any increase  in unemployment which might arise through stagnation                 in the paper  manufacturing industry in this country.                     Sir Albert Stanley replied in the affirmative, and urged that  the                 restrictions should be withdrawn forthwith.                     Mr.  Chamberlain said  that  before the Conference arrived at a                 decision  on  the points  he  would  like to  have an opportunity of                 conferring with his  Department  on the bearing  the matter had on                 the Swedish  exchange.                     The Chairman said in that case they would  postpone  their                 decision to the next meeting.
It was agreed that the necessary steps should be taken to carry    this decision into effect.     6.  Sir Albert, Stanley said that the policy in regard to restric- tions on imports which the Board of Trade were recommending to the War Cabinet was very simple.   Briefly, it was that the import of all completely manufactured articles should be restricted over a period, say, up to the  end of June next;  that restrictions on the import of all partly manufactured articles would seriously impede manufacturers here; but  by keeping up certain restrictions  over a  period, the Government would  be enabling our  own  manufacturers to place themselves in a  position  to  set up their plant and generally equip themselves for competing with foreign traders.  The Board of Trade were alive to the fact that our  foreign  trade  connections should not be imperilled, but they were  anxious that all  dumping of goods in this country should be  prevented.   Sir  Albert mentioned the case  of motor cars,  on  which  there was a 30 per  cent. duty.  If motor cars were allowed free into this country a good-will would  be established by foreign traders, and our own manufacturers would  be unable  to compete with them,  particularly as the manufacturers of motor cars  in this country had in many cases during the war been manufacturing nothing but aeroplane engines;  but manufacturers of motor cars in, for  instance,  America had not, speaking generally, ceased  making  motor cars,  and,  even  if  they  had, the   change from war  conditions to peace conditions there was a very simple thing compared  with  what   it  was  in   the   United  Kingdom. Sir  Albert  thought, with regard  to  the Board of Trade  recom- mendations, that  before  the restrictions  contained  in them were taken off  the advice of  both  manufacturers  and consumers  in this country should be taken.   He mentioned that there was one other  class  of imported  article, the import of which it might  be advisable to prohibit, and that was goods that might be described as luxury articles.   He  thought, however, that this  was more a matter for the Treasury  than the  Board of Trade,  as it was  a question  of&quot; spending money,  of exhausting foreign credits for articles that were not absolutely necessary.     Lord Emmott said that his Consultative Council had not made detailed enquiries into this question, as they thought it was better to wait until a definite policy  was laid down.  He thought  that all the various interests concerned  should be consulted, and that  pre-war and  present prices should be  considered, and also  the amount  of profits that had been and were being made, and then that it should be made known  definitely to  the  trades how long restrictions on imports were going to remain, and he did  not suggest that the period should be necessarily the same  for every industry or article.   It was uncertainty  that was  hindering industry, and arrangements could be made with  the  trades concerned  without publishing them  in the newspapers.     Sir Alfred  Mond pointed  out  that  an  anti-dumping Bill wasbeing introduced into Parliament, and for that reason  alone it wouldbe necessary to keep up the restrictions for  the present.    Mr. Manville said he understood that the  United  States wouldbe glad to see the restrictions on imports into  this country removed,and that the American Chamber of Commerce  was calling a meeting with the object of arriving at some settlement  of the matter,    The Chairman pointed out that what was being recommendedwas not complete prohibition, but what  might be termed  rationing&quot;of prohibition.    Mr.  Chamberlain addressed the Conference on the subject fromthe point of view of rates of exchange between   this country andothers, and laid emphasis on the necessity for preventing the import of any unnecessary articles or goods into this country.
     The Chairman  said that in considering  this matter they must look into the future, and he asked Sir Albert Stanley what machinerythe  Board of Trade possessed - for  shielding the  various classes  ofindustries in this country.     Sir Albert Stanley said that generally the protection existed inthe retention of restriction on imports that he had spoken of, and inthe  prevention of dumping of foreign goods  in  this  country.  he explained that the Board  of  Trade had  set up  an organisation  forrecording, investigating, and considering the &quot;pivotal&quot; industries inthe  country, and also what  might be called  &quot; nascent&quot; industries,and  that this organisation would consider each particular industry as time went on, they would, it was hoped, cover all the ground andwould make recommendations for affording  such  industries any pro-tection that they might require.   He mentioned the case of the dyeindustry, and pointed out that the import of dyes into this country was  prohibited  for ten years, but  that  there was a  special  Boardappointed to deal with the question of such imports.   The protectionthat the &quot; nascent&quot; industries would require would not only be fromimports, but would take the form of Government financial assistance.In some cas^s only protection from imports would be required, but in others both  forms of protection would be necessary.   In reply  to an enquiry from Sir Alfred Mond as to how long the restrictions  couldkept up without further legislation, Sir Albert  said that most of these restrictions  were  based on&apos;  pre-war legislation,  but that he wasbringing forward a Bill shortly which would  give him, as far as  couldbe ceen, all the authority he would require.     Mr. Pease said that it should  be borne  in mind that,   in considering  the question of removing the restrictions, the existenceof the blockade was very essential  towards  exacting  from Germanywhat was required.     The Chairman referred to a letter which had been received fromthe Triumph Cycle Company (Limited), complaining of the restrictionson  exports  to France  and  Italy.   He  thought  what  was reallyreferred to was import restrictions imposed  by those  two countries.and, that being so, the  subject was one allied to the one they werediscussing.   The Triumph Cycle Company (Limited) had agencies  in both these countries, and were naturally anxious to get their businessflowing again.     Mr. Illingworth referred to  a similar case in  respect  of woollengoods,  whe*re  it  had  been impossible  to  discover  whether therestrictions were on exports imposed by this country, or on importsimposed by a foreign country.     Sir Percy Bates reminded thj  Conference of  a  statement that had  been made at a previous meeting  to  the effect that  the FrenchGovernment were reducing their imports of woollen goods by 50 percent.  He  understood that  the French were  using their import restrictions to control tonnage, and that the same remark  applied  toItaly.     Sir Albert Stanley  said the restrictions  in question must  beimport restrictions, imposed by France or Italy, as the  case might be,and he mentioned that the French Minister in,charge  of the subject was  coming to London to  hold a conference  with the Treasury andthe Board of Trade on the subject very shortly.     The Chairman pointed out  that  it  would be just as necessaryfor the French to impose import restrictions as for us, and, in fact,they might have additional reasons, but  in any case it was apparent that the obstacles  in the cases quoted had  arisen out  of Frenchimport restrictions and not out of British export restrictions, and  hethought British traders should know of this.     [1205]-288                                          C
    Mr. Manville said that he understood the restrictions ofof British goods into France were more stringent than those dealingwith American goods.    Mr.  Chapman  said the Board  of  Trade  had  been anxiously-examining the position that he understood was arising by reason ofthe demands for goods from France passing over this country andgoing to America.   He thought that what might be  done was for usto sell our stocks in France as against such indemnity as the FrenchGovernment might receive, and that the  British Government shouldfinance our producers.     Mr.  Chamberlain pointed out,  in regard  to the United Statesbeing more favoured than the United Kingdom, that the reason wasno doubt  that America was in a better position  to sell on credit or togive Government credit to France than  we were.  With regard toMr. Chapman&apos;s  point, he mentioned  that his predecessor had made an arrangement with  Belgium whereby all new  money became a first charge on the amount of indemnity received.  He had made a similar arrangement with Italy, and was endeavouring to do the same in thecase of France.     The  Chairman stated  that  the principle should be that newmoney should be a first charge, even before reparation requirements.     It was agreed that:      The  policy as regards imports should be as follows :      (a.)  All raw material shall be admitted free of restriction.     (6.)  Semi-manufactured materials that are necessary as material            for the  manufactures of this  country shall be admitted            free without  restriction, excepting  so  far as they are            produced by  industries which it is essential to foster in           . this country, and which  require shielding, in which case            they will be restricted.     (c.)  Manufactured articles shall be  subject to  restriction when            not necessary for consumption in this country, or when            produced by industries which require to  be shielded from            foreign  competition, while re-establishing  themselves in            passing from  war work to peace work, or which have been            created or encouraged to expand owing to circumstances            arising out of the war.                The  restriction to continue for  a period not  extend-            ing beyond  1st  September,  without a  further decision            from the Cabinet.     (d.)  The Board of Trade to take steps to consider what should be            done to maintain in the country industries which it is the            policy of the Government to  foster.                This policy shall not be limited to existing restrictions.     It was decided that the foregoing policy should be brought into operation immediately.     It was also agreed that:      The Board of Trade  should take steps to inform British traders          that the  obstacles in the  way  of. exporting goods did not          necessarily  arise out of exports  restrictions enforced in this          country, but  rather  by reason of the import restrictions          enforced by the foreign countries concerned.Land Settlement.           With reference to  Minute 2 (/))  of the Third Meeting, the  J                  Chairman said he understood that Mr. Chamberlain and Lord Ernie                  had conferred on this matter.
Housing Scheme.         8.  With  reference  to Minute 2  (a) of the Third  Meeting,                  Mr. Symonds submitted a statement prepared by the Local Govern-                  ment Board.                                        *                      The Chairman emphasised the  necessity of recognising that the                  provision of employment was one of the most important considera-                  tions of the Government  housing  scheme.  An  important point in                  the whole  question was whether  orders for  fittings required in                  houses should be given to the builders themselves.                      Mr. Sijmonds  said that the builders took  the  view that they                  should make windows, doors, &amp;c. par?&apos;  passu with the houses, and                  that they were opposed to orders for these things being placed with                  Government factories.   He added that the action of the Ministry of                  Supplies in placing  some orders of this nature recently had evoked                  considerable protest, and there was a further consideration that such                  a course probably entailed an increase in the total cost of  building                  the houses.                     Sir Alfred Mond observed that, generally speaking, builders did                  not make doors and windows  themselves, but let the contracts out                  to others, and he thought  that  the reason why builders  were so                  anxious to obtain the contract  for fittings  as well as the houses was                  partly that thereby they were  enabled to reap greater profit.                     The Chairman  said that our main object at  present should be to                  adopt such a policy  as would stimulate employment.   At the present                  time  the Government was paying vast  sums in  unemployment                  donations, and if by   a change of policy unemployment  could  be                  reduced an  economy  would he effected for the State, even  if the                .  cost was increased through giving separate orders for fittings.                     Mr. Symonds remarked that, in regard to contracts for bricks, *                  it had been found that  the limited tenders had been so hedged with                  conditions that they could not  be accepted.  With regard to placing                  orders for fittings with  national factories, there was another objection,                  in that in many cases the work would be carried out  by workpeople                 who were not properly  accustomed to the work.                     Mr. Chamberlain  said that, in his  view, the proper policy  to-                  adopt was to give to firms whose normal  occupation was the making                  of fittings such orders as would keep them fully occupied, and then                 to  give  the  remainder to national  factories.   With regard to the                 analysis of the public works contemplated by the Local Government                 Board, he was afraid that the information contained therein  was not                 what  he really desired, and he  asked if  the information &quot;could  be                 given in the form of answers to the following questions:                    -  (1.) What works  under each head could be proceeded with  at                           once ?                     (2.) What sum would be  required for such works in the. year                           1919-20?      [1205]-288    *                                                  D     Lord Ernie said that this was so, and that, while it must beadmitted  that the  present  prices made the launching of the landsettlement scheme a very difficult matter, it was necessary, of course,to cany out pledges that had been given.     Mr.  Chamberlain  said that the  arrangement that he and LordErnie had come to was that 20,000,000L should be allocated to  thisscheme, which was to be limited to settling  ex-service men on  theland, with  the exception  that  if it were  discovered  that smallholdings  existed for which  no ex-service men could be found, thensuitable persons, other than ex-service men,  should be  allowed totake over such holdings.  He regarded the scheme as uneconomical,but he also thought it was  necessary  to carry  out our obligations to ex-service men.
    (3.) How much of  the  sum  so required must be found  by           Government loans ?    (4.) If further Government funds were available, on what works           could  they best be  spent  with a view  to giving  the           maximum of employment at the ,earliest possible date?    He asked whether the Local Government  Board intended to spend to the full amount of money sanctioned by the Treasury.   Asthe Treasury was not in a position to provide sufficient money for allthe work  contemplated,  it was most important  that  those works should be chosen which would  use  the money available to the best advantage.  Some local  authorities  could, of course, raise  money,although the amount which they could raise was very uncertain, butit must be borne in mind that the terms on which money could  beraised might be prohibitive.    Mr.  Symonds said that he  would  endeavour  to supply  theinformation  desired  by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,  but atthe same time it would be difficult to give any very explicit answers.If a local authority obtained sanction from the  Local GovernmentBoard for a  particular  scheme, it  did  not necessarily proceed to borrow the money at once ; it might have funds available already, or,at any rate, it might not be necessary to pay within the  present financial year.   He would, however, arrange for local authorities tobe asked to notify the Board when they proposed to borrow money.    Mr. Chamberlain said that local authorities should be encouraged to raise money themselves, and it was intended to maintain the rule that any  local authority with  a rateable value exceeding 200,000 .must endeavour to obtain it in the open market.   In order to makeit possible for local authorities to obtain money in the united States,arrangements had been made for municipal loans of this descriptionto be free of income tax.    Mr. Symonds said that the  fear that restrictions which had beenrelaxed might be subsequently reimposed was delaying the  signing of contracts, and he  suggested that some public statement upon thispoint might be desirable.    Sir Percy Bates asked that if any  such statement was madethe Ministry of Shipping might be consulted, as shipping contractsoften Jasted over  a protracted period, and also the question of freight charges was  often an  important factor in estimating  the cost of aparticular piece of work.     The Chairman thought it most desirable that a statement shouldbe made in respect of the building trade.    Sir Alfred Mond suggested that it should be extended to otherindustries, e.g., that  of making cardboard  boxes.    The Chairman, however,  thought that this point could betterbe met by announcing the removal of paper restrictions.     Mr. Larke suggested that if any  announcement  of  this kindwere  made  it might induce some contractors to  enter into longcontracts, and that  the Government might meet with difficulty if itwere desired to reimpose restrictions.     Mr. Symonds said  that  he believed  that a  number of the verylarge   building contractors  had at  the  present  time  no  orders  ofimportance owing to the extreme uncertainty of the position.     After further discussion, it was agreed that-     The  Board of Trade should arrange  for an announcement to be         made in the press that if, in regard to building and building         materials,  it  should  prove  to   be  necessary,  owing  to         unforeseen circumstances,  to  reimpose  any restric ion, no         contract entered into before the reimposition of the restriction
Preference to           9. Mr. Pease suggested that all Government Departments shouldBritish Traders.     agree  to buy from manufacturers in England, even if the  cost of so                  doing  were greater than the cost of obtaining the article in a foreign                  country.                      Mr. Chamberlain agreed with this principle, and added that if it                  were not possible to obtain the article in England, the order should                  be placed somewhere in the British Empire, and that only in the last                  resort should an  order be placed with a foreign country.  He added                  that instructions had been issued by the War Cabinet that, in placing                  orders, preference should  be given within the  Empire.                      Mr. Manville suggested that these instructions should be made                  quite clearly to apply to local authorities.                      Sir Henry Lambert said that  it was  the policy of  the Colonial                  Government to place within the Empire orders sent by the Colonial                  Governments  to  the Crown Agents, but  that it was occasionally                  necessary to place a contract in a foreign country.                      The Chairman recalled an occasion on which railway material for                  one of the Colonies was bought in  the United States just before the                  armistice.   He enquired whether a thing of this kind would recur ?                      Sir Henry Lambert  said that some considerations might  arise                  which would necessitate going to a foreign country ; for example, he                  believed that there  had  been cases in which a special  type of  loco-                  motive was required for  a colonial railway, for which locomotives                  constructed  in this  country were  not regarded as suitable, but it                  might be taken as certain that all orders sent to the Crown Agents                  would  be  executed in this country,  or within the Empire, in the                  absence of some very special reason to prevent  this.                      Mr. Chamberlain said that, in  consequence of a decision of the                  Imperial War  Cabinet arising out  of a  point  raised by Sir Robert                  Borden, he had issued instructions, in the terms of which the Prime                  Minister, Mr.  Bonar Law, and Sir Robert Borden had concurred,                  that preference should  be given throughout the Empire to British                  traders, both as regards price and terms of contract.                      After further discussion, it was agreed that                       Recommendations of a similar tenor  to those referred to by                          Mr. Chamberlain should be circulated to local authorities.                      The Conference took note that it was the settled policy to place                           within the Empire orders sent by the  Colonial Govern-                          ments to the Crown Agents,  but that it was occasionally                          necessary to place a contract in a foreign country.Eaw Materials:           10. In response to an enquiry by the Chairman, Mr. Larke  saidG-overnment Stocks,  that he did not think there had been any reduction in &quot;the  prices of                  metal since the first  meeting  of the Conference.  It  was possible                  thai the price of copper had been reduced, but he did not think  that                  the price of lead was likely to go lower  than 25Z. per ton.                       The Chairman suggested that it would  be an advantage if the                  fact that prices were now at their lowest limit were ventilated in the                  press.                       Mr. Larke thought that any such step as that suggested  by the                  Chairman would  be difficult, in view of the fact that  the United                  States of America, or some  other country,  might reduce the priceshall be affected, unless the power to reimpose is specificallyreserved;  and, further, that such reimposition should notapply to any contract in  fulfilment of which work  hadalready been commenced.
below  the  existing price of this  country.   He felt that if anyinspired statement should happen to be stultified by the  event  inthis  manner, it would only create a sense of instability-and do more harm than good.     The Chairman said that he still thought that careful ventilationof the subject in the press would be of material assistance, and he added  that  he thought it would be  desirable  to try to break themarket in one of the metals  and then let the  price come slowly upto its normal level.     Mr. Larke said that he  would convey the views of the meeting to the  Minister of Supply.     Mr. Chamberlain said he would be glad to discuss  the matterpersonally with the Minister, if Lord Inverforth would like him todo this.     11. The Chairman stated that, according to the information in his possession, one factor which tended to  prevent  the resuscitation oftrade, was that one or two  of the great purchasing Departments ofthe State  were showing themselves somewhat slow in paying for thegoods which they had ordered, and he thought that the desirabilityof settling their accounts as soon as possible  should he emphasisedto the Departments concerned.     It was agreed that      The attention of the Departments concerned should be drawn to         this matter, and that they should be instructed to take all         action  uecessary  for  settling  their accounts as  soon  asPurchasing Depart-ments:Settlement of accounts.(Initialled).
