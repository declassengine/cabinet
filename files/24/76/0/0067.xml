REPORT OF SECRET SERVICE  COMMITTEE./ppoint meritana termB  ofreference.Members.Evidence.Scope of inquiry.Secret Service  5.before the war. 1.       This  Committee was appointed by the War Cabinet on the  24-th January (War Cabinet&apos;519; Minute 4) to inquire (a) what is  being done  at present by the Secret Service Branches of thei , several Departments, -(b) how &apos;this work oan best be oo-ordiriated  with a view to the  necessary aotionbeing taken with the  \&quot;.  utmost promptitude.                                   &quot;,:  &apos; 2.                    Lord Curzon:(Chairman)                      Mr. W. L$ng  or Lord Lytton (Admiralty),......                      Mr. Shortt (Home Office)                      Lord Peel (War Office).                  .....  Mr. Macpherspn (Irish Offioe)         Representatives or officials  of  other Departments were  summoned to the meetings.  ,      * 3.       The Committee had before  them a memorandum  by the First  Lord of the Admiralty (Paper G.T.6665) which led  to theappoint-  roent of the Committee and a memorandum by the Home Secretary^   (Paper G.T.6690).   * They also had memoranda from  the Foreign&apos;-  Office, War Office, Admiralty,! Home Office, India Office  and   Irish Office, giving particulars of the  intelligence services   of those Departments.   The Committee  obtained further  informa-   tion personally from Lord  Hardinge, Sir  Edward Troup&apos;, Mr.  Basil  . Thomson, Captain-Mansf ield-Cumming, R.N.,&apos; and&apos;:CoIonel Kell.         Mr. Long&apos;s&apos;paper  is  primarily concerned with what  he &apos;   calls the civilian&quot; side  of &quot;secret  service, that  is tf  say,  the   machinery for collecting  information about  persons engaged in r;   revolutionary&apos;or anarchical  movements  in this  country.    While   therefore the Committee  have  made  a brief survey of  the Whole   of the secret &quot;service as  they were  instructed to do  by&apos;their   terms of reference, they  have&apos;devoted; their-attention especially   to this civil side.         The existing military organization of  secret service in   this  country may be said  to date from 1909  when&quot; the  subject was   considered by the- Committee  of  Imperial Defence.   As  a result.4.
                                     r 8 -of recommendations made by that body an organization was estab-lished with two branches.   The first branch, which was placed       ,under the. general oontrol of the foreign Office was entrusted with the duty of obtaining secret information from abroad on military, naval and other matters.   The information so obtainedhas been placed at the disposal of all Government Departments con-cerned, but it was intended primarily for military purposes.Captain Mansfield-Cumming, R.N., has been&apos;Director of this service from the beginning.   The second branch, which was placed underthe general control of the War Office (Director of Military Intelli-gence), has been concerned with oounter-espionage,. that is to say,measures for detecting foreign agents working in this country andfor frustrating their efforts.   The Director of this branch isColonel Kell, who has also been in charge of the branch since 1909.      The naval as well as the military authorities have&apos; shared  inthe service afforded by this organization, but they have maintained for purely naval purposes a separate staff under the Director ofNaval Intelligence.      For intelligence other than military there are the followingagenciess-      The Home Office has maintained for many years a small service for obtaining secret information in regard to Ireland, especially inAmerica.   The Home Office also, by means of the Metropolitan Police,is responsible for obtaining  information in regard to anarchists andother dangerous political criminals.   The inquiries are made by theSpecial Branch of the Criminal Investigation Department under Mr, BasilThomson, one of the Assistant Commissioners of Police.   Similarinquiries are conducted in Ireland by the Irish Police&apos;.      The India Office depends for its intelligence to some extent onthe agencies already mentioned, but in addition the Director of  CentralIntelligence in India employs officers both in this country and  on theContinent to keep a watch on Indian suspects.
&apos; SECRET 6.      THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE MILITARY INTELLIGENCE service before          DESCRIBED ABOVE HAD BEEN JUSTIFIED BY ITS RESULTS EVEN BEFORE THE          OUTBREAK OF WAR.   THE COUNTER-ESPIONAGE BRANCH, WORKING IN CLOSE          CO-OPERATION WITH THE HOME OFFICE, HAD SUCCEEDED IN GETTING INTO          TOUCH WITH THE GREATER NUMBER, IF NOT ALL, THE GERMAN AGENTS IN          THIS COUNTRY, WITH THE SATISFACTORY RESULT THAT ON THE OUTBREAK OF          WAR ALL SUSPEOTS WERE ARRESTED! AND THE GERMAN SPY ORGANIZATION          WAS BROKEN UP.   THE FACT THAT NO ACT OF SABOTAGE WAS committed          BY GERMAN AGENTS DURING THE FIRST CRITIOAL MONTHS OF THE WAR BEARS          GOOD TESTIMONY TO THE VALUE OF THIS WORK,SERVICE   7,      THE CONDITIONS OF WAR LED TO A LARGE EXPANSION OF secret the WAR.        /          SERVICE IN EVERY DIRECTION.   THE MSIN EXPANSION TOOK PLAOE IN THE          FOREIGN OFFIOE SERVICE IN WHICH THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS GROWTH IN          ALL  KINDS  OF SENRET  OPERATIONS ABROAD, INVOLVING THE EXPENDITURE           OF VERY  LARGO SUMS  OF MONEY.   THE COMMITTEE HAVE GOOD REASON  FOR           BELIEVING THAT HEAVY AS  THIS  OUTLAY HAS  BEEN, IT HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY           JUSTIFIED BY THE  RESULTS AND  THAT THE  INFORMATION THUS PLACED  AT           THE DISPOSAL OF  THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN EQUAL, IF NOT           SUPERIOR, TO THAT OBTAINED BY ANY OTHER  COUNTRY ENGAGED  IN THE WAR.                 COLONEL KELL&apos;S BRANCH  EXPERIENCED  A SIMILAR  EXPANSION AND           UNDERTOOK A NUMBER  OF NEW DUTIES ACCORDING AS THE  CIRCUMSTANOES  OF           THE WAR REQUIRED.   APART FROM ITS MAIN FUNCTION IN TRACING AND           WATCHING SPIES,  GOOD WORK HAS BEEN DONE  IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE           HOME OFFIOE IN DEALING WITH ALL QUESTIONS RELATING TO ALIENS AND            SUEPEOTS IN THIS COUNTRY, PARTICULARLY IN REGARD TO THE ENTRY AND            DEPARTURE OF PERSONS TO AND FROM BRITISH PORTS.                 THE NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.BRANCH UNDER ADMIRAL HALL UNDERTOOK            NEW SPNERES  OF ACTIVITY, ESPECIALLY IN SPAIN AND SOUTH AMERICA,            WHERE THE EXISTING  SOURCES OF INFORMATION APPEARED TO THE NAVAL            AUTHORITIES TO BE INSUFFICIENT OR UNSUITABLE FROM THE NAVAL POINT            OF  VIEW.
                                a.  4;  **       It is  understood  that  tho Air  Force has also  established an  intelligence  branch  of its  own, .       On the civil  sldo tho  conditions  of tho present war  gave  greater Importance than has boon  the case  in any previous war to  intelligence  on politioal and industrial matters.   Tho work  of  collecting  and circulating  such information was undertaken&apos; by  the Home Office through the Special Branch at Now  Scotland  Yard.  In this direction  the  work  of Mr. Basil Thomson has grown far  beyond his  ordinary  functions.    Apart from a very large1  increase  of work of  a  polioe  charaoter involved in  the administration  of  the regulations regarding aliens,  etc., Mr, Thomson has given  special attention  to pacifist and-revolutionary propaganda, and           ;  by the direction of  Lord Cave the results  of his inquiries  wore  embodied  in a useful report issued by  the  Home Seoretary  to the  Cabinet every fortnight. t  The  Special Branch also became the  repository  of much valuable information about labour  conditions  and movements in this  country.    This  work was first  undertaken  by the Ministry of Munitions, but later it was found  desirable&apos;to  transfer  it to the Speoial  Branch,  though  the service-continued&apos;to  be paid for by the Ministry of  Munitions,   The  information is&quot;  summarized  in a dally  report on labour unrest &quot;which is circulated  to the Ministers and Departments  mainly ooncornedvv8.     There  is no doubt that as  a  reqult  of the general extension   Results of                                                                     expansion                                                                     during tho  of the secret service  organization there has  be-en  overlapping of   war.  activity  and  responsibility, and  the  large sums.of money  re-  quired for  all these operations have  not always-  been   expended  economically or to the best advantage,  Casos were quoted to  the Committee of agents employed  and,paid  separately  by more  than one  branch of the intelligence service and  of-information  by the same agent  being given  to  different branches,  with the  result that one report appeared to confirm the  other  though both
  really Came  from the  same  source.   Suoh  a  duplication  of  effort  is perhaps inseparable  from Secret  Servioe  work,  but  is nevertheless  to be deprecated and  with  experience ought  to be  reduced to a                                                  (i -  minimum.9.     Since the armistice it has been found  possible to  effect a  substantial  reduction in the military and naval branohes of the  secret service,   Tho question  as to the  future of this service  will have to be considered, but the Committee do not  think it oan  bo decided at the present moment, when many of the responsible  officers are engaged in more urgent duties.   They recommend that  the question of reorganization should be  considered after the War ,  by tho Committee of Imperial Defence or suoh other body as may be  formed to deal with questions of defence.   It will probably be  found convenient to maintain the distinction between military and  civil intelligence.   In time of   peace a fairly sharp distinction  exists between theae respective  spheres,  though in time of war  muoh intelligence which deals with merely civil matters is of  the greatest value to the military authorities.   Tho Committee.  suggest, however, that it would  be desirable to co-ordinate all  intelligence for military purposes and to  establish one  organization which will serve alike the War Office,  Admiralty and  Air Force,   The War has tended  to  emphasize the unity of  the  fighting serviaes, and among-other pieces  of machinery which might  be common to them ell the  important sphere of  intelligence should  not  be  overlooked,10.      The Committee were much impressed by  the  need which  is  indioated in Mr. Long^ paper  for  come immediate  change as regard--  oivil intelligence,   Mr,  Long*s oritioism is  directed not so much  against the quantity or quality  of the information obtained as  against the use made of it,   Mr.  Thomson  appears to havo shown   energy and  resource  in  adapting  his maohinery  to war conditions,
 and a great deal of valuable information has  been obtained,  but&quot;he has been hampered by the pressure of other duties.   At  tho present time the collection of reliable intelligence  is so&apos; Ira- portant that tho work should occupy the whole time of the officer concerned.   The Committee endorses Mr. &apos;Long&apos;s recommen- dation in this respeot and they think that a  Secret Service Department should be oreated without delay.atid they reoommend that Mr. Thomson, in virtue of his abilities  and groat oxper- ience should be placed at its head.   He should be relieved of his ordinary police duties and should devote his entire time to the collection and dissemination of intelligence. When the war is over and social conditions have reverted  to a more normal course fche future official organization of  oivil intelligence may aome up for re-examination in the light  of the experience gained.       As to the use made of information when obtained, Mr. Long proposes that there should be a minister of Cabinet rank whose &apos; duty it shall be to take action as  soon as information is brought to his notioe,.       The Committee are convinced that the reports which are circulated sometimes receive too little attention, and that some method should be devised of bringing  important pieces of information to  the special  notioe  of  the Ministers concerned. The matters dealt with affect so many departments that in  the great majority  of cases no Minister (except  the  Prime Minister who  is  obviously too busy  to  give his attention  to the subject) could  be  charged with the  duty  of  taking action  over  the heads of his  colleagues.   The Committee   think, however,  that a great improvement would be effected  if  a  careful watch were kept on the  character of tho information  obtained and steps  taken  to bring special items at  onoe to the  personal  notice of the
responsible Minister,  and where desirable of the Cabinet.In some cases prompt action might be taken at once on, thoauthority of the Minister-concerned/-.  Having regard to the close connection between civil intelligence and police work,the Home Secretary would appear to be the Minister naturally.  -pointed out for. the - discharge of theso functions.  . But iVisfor the Cabinet rather than for the Committee to.decide whether any other Minister..should preferably bo selected or is availablefor tho work;      It should of(oourse continue to bo a part of Mr. Thomsori&apos;sduty to bring any information of: special importance - e.g.information showing the-cause of discontent among some body ofmen - prominently to the notice of the Department concerned:  -but where tho matter is likely to have serious consequences or&apos;                                             -.          &quot; t      .oalls for immediate action-he should at once refer, it- td the responsible Minister selected for the purpose.      . -     There remains the question1 of the source from which the &apos;expenses of the contemplated organization should be paid.   It  ;is unlikely that Parliament after the/termination qf the War andwhen Votes of Credit are no longer available will be disposed to vote for Secret Servioe the very large Sums which have-inrecent years been expended on* that objeot.   On the other hand it is equally clear&apos; that  the Pre-War Parliamentary grants maynot suffice for the purposes required.   In these lines it has&apos;been suggested that-a large capital sum should be placed at-thedisposal of the new Department, the interest of which  should  beavailable  for Secret Service.-  The Committee commend  this  &apos;suggestion to the  favourable consideration of the Treasury andthe Cabinet. ,     There is another matter to which the Committee think it right  to refer, though  it was not included in their terms  ofreference.   Sir Edward Troup  brought before the Committee  the
1pressing need for some form of propaganda against Bolshevism inthis country.   He thought that facts whioh might bo effective  :&apos;for anti-Bolshevist propaganda but which could not be publishedofficially, sometimes fail to reaoh the public for want of an agency whioh could be trusted to  oommunicate them to the, press  &apos;discreetly and in such a way aB to secure their publication.The Committee agree with the view that this subject has been too much neglected in tho past and that a good deal of benefit mightbe anticipated from strengthening public opinion against thesinister influences which have been and are still at work.   Itis generally admitted.that the readiest means of influencingpublio opinion in present circumstances are by newspaper articles,public speaking and cinematograph films.   A good deal has beendone by the newspapers lately to  open people&apos;s eyes to the realdangers of Bolshevism, but it would be a wi3e policy to see thatthe press is kept supplied with all information which may bearon this subject.   As regards public speaking, the CommitteeRelieve that this agency has suffered, from neglect owing in themain to the fact that many popular speakers have been engagedduring the war in other work.   The result is that too oftenseditious speeches are left unanswered.   They think there isplenty of scope for speakers throughout the country, especiallyin working-olass areas, who could enlighten publio opinion on agreat many subjeots where ignorance tends to produce suspicionand distrust.   Something too might be achieved by the judicioususe of olnematorgaph  films though this is a matter on which theCommittee cannot express an expert opinion.   They understand thatsome scheme  of propaganda has boon under contemplation in theForeign Ufficd and they recommend that an officer should be immediately  appointed to organize this work.   He should be kept in close touch with Mr, Thomson, who, from tho information at his
disposal, would be able to indicate the most usefulscope and direction of such propaganda, and likeMr. Thomson he would be.responsible to the cabinet minister entrusted with the general control of thenew organization.
