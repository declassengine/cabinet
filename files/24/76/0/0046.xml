GOVERMENT SCHEME OF ASSISTANCE FOR THE HIGHERUCATION OF EX-SERVICE OFFICERS AND MS,3ffc^OHAKDUm BY THE PRESIDENT OF THS BOARD OF EDUCATIONAH) THE SECRETARY OF STATE EOR THE COLONIES.A.   Inclusion of Oversea Lien, who desire to follow          Courses cf University Education in the United          Kingdom,3.   Provision for assisting men domiciled in the United          Kingdom to follow Courses of University Education          in  (aj the Oversea Dominions,              (b) Foreign Countries,C   Provision for assisting  Oversea men in special cases          te  follow Courses of University Education in          Foreign Countries or Dominions,                         A,          It is submitted that in the provision of assistance for ex-Service students to pursue University Courses orCourses of University standard at Institutions in the UnitedKingdom, no distinction should &quot;be drawn between -     (a)  men of British nationality ordinarily domiciled          in the.United Kingdom, and     (b)  men of British nationality ordinarily domiciled          in the Dominions and Colonies,who have served during the war in the lifonO., Military or air Forces of the Crorm, for which payment,  is made out of moneys provided &quot;by Parliament.          If this principle is accepted, men from Canada or
     Australia, who for one reason or another enlisted in     isritish Units, and iv-en from South Africa (whether they     joined the South Africeji contingent or enlisted in South     Africa or at home for British Unite), will be entitled     to assistance under the Scheme,  Xt^&amp;92.JlL^lJJLJ^SISHS.     courses of advanced education in the United Kingdom.     Americans, however, or men of other foreign nationalJJtiee^     who enlisted in British Units, will he excluded.   It is     unlikely that there would &quot;be  jmany Americans etc. in this     class; hut if-they are to be included special authority     would be required,2*             It is probably desirable to confine the scheme,     so far.as Oversea officers and men are concerned, to those     who desire to unaertake and are fit to undertake full-time     Courses of University standard.    The reasons which     render it desirable to assist these men apply with much     less force to Oversea men who desire to follow Courses of     Commercial or Technical Education of a lower grade.3,             In the result of a Conference held with Colonel     Lord Gorell, Director of Ar:y Education, and the &quot;Imperial     Education Committee&quot;, at Ada3tral House on the 20th February!     it apoears that the number of Oversea men who                                                                 I     have served in British Units and wish to take advantage     I     of the Scheme of Assistance will be small, and will not                                                                 1     appreciably add to the strain on the accommodation and     teaching power of the Universities.4.             To extend the Scheme to all -men of British        j;                                                                 !.     nationality who have served in contingents; of the     Colonies or Dominions and been paid out of funds provided     b^y their Governments would considerably increase the     number of applicants.    The British taxpayer might ask     why he should pay the cost of these :aenfs education in     the United Kinfcdo.&quot;..    It seems reasonable that the
     Dominion Governments should themselves provide assistance     for their own men who have served in their own Forces and     who wish to pursue their education in England.   Canada     has arranged to place 250 men in tho British Universities,     but only a small number of these will remain after the      autumn.   $ew Zealand has sanctioned the award of 50     scholarships tenable at British Universities to men of     the Hew Zealand Forces.    South Africa has also sanctioned     the award of 20 scholarships tenable in England,  of which     3 have been  awarded.  It is probable that not more than     40 South Africans altogether will require University     Education in England.5.             It is probably desirable,  if the principle in     paragraph 1 is adopted, that the selection of Oversea men     for assistance should be done by some body like Lord     Gorell&apos;9 Imperial Education Committee, acting in concert     with the Universities and other Institutions which the     men wish to attend and Trith the ioard of Education.6,             If the iorinciple of paragraph 1 is accepted, it     is desirable that an announcement should be issued at     once; otherwise the men who might be concerned will have     left England.                              3.7.             A further question Is whether the Government     Scheme should be extended so as to apply to men who have     served in the Forces of the Crown ^aid out cf moneys     provided by Parliament and are of British nationality and     ordinarily domiciled in the United Kingdom, who wish to     pursue Courses of Education (i) at Oversea Universities in     the British Empire (India, Australia, Canada, South Africa,     Hew Zealand); (ii) at Foreign Universities (America, Srance,     Italy, S^ain).8.       (i)   As regards Oversea Universities in the British
    Empire  it  is submitted  that  such  an  extension  is  extremely    desirable  on the following grounds -          (a)   To relieve  the  probable congestion of British               Universities  and other  Institutions  in  the               autumn.          (b)   To enable men damaged in  the  war,  especially               men who  have  contracted pulmonary  affections               through  *:;as or  exposure, to pursue their               education in  a  different climate.          (o)   Educationally it may be advantageous to a man,&apos;               even  if  he  intends to return  to England,  to be               educated in an  Oversea University: and  if he               intends  to  settle  in one  of  the Dominions or               Colonies, or  to acquire knowledge  of their con-               ditions  for business purposes,  his education               there may give  him much better openings for               future  employment  or trade than if he were               educated at home.          (d)   It  is desirablejfrom an Imperial point of  view               to  encourage  Englishmen to go to Oversea  Univer-               necessities,  especially those  men who intend to enter               public  life,9..        (ii)   As  regards Foreign Universities,  it is obviously     desirable  that English  ex-Service students who wish to     study abroad  instead  of at home, in order to acquire feoviliar     ity with foreign languages and with foreign modes of thought     and life,  should be assisted to do  so,  both on educational     grounds and with a view to providing the*&quot; with the best     possible equipment for  a public or  commercial life.10.            If  this extension of the  Scheme is approved it ia     probably desirable that it should in the first instance be     confined to a limited number of j*.en or u limited sum of     money  (3ay  100,000 for (i)  and      50,000 &quot;for (ii)).                              4.
This would emphasise the principle of selectionj and careful selection is desirable if ^aste of public money is to be avoided.    It is impossible to keep as close touch with the men who are sent abroad or overseas aswith the men educated in the United Kingdpm.          It is also probobly desirable that the men who wish- to&apos;* procefed to Oversea Universities in the BritishEmpire  should be selected by a special body, of which the  &quot;Imperial Education Committee&quot; Right form a nucleus,and that this body should be responsible for making arrangements with the Oversea Universities, for recommend&quot;ing the students1 allowances, for receiving periodical reports from the. Universities as  to  the students&apos;-  conductand progress, and for certifying  that  the  instalments of allowances are payable.                          C           It is  possible  that  in  certain  cases  Oversea  menOf British nationality who have served in tho Forces  paid out  of  monies provided byrPerIiyment may  have  special reasons for  dusiring to  study  at  a Dominion University (other  than  a University in  the  dominion,of their  domicile)or  at  a Foreign  University rather than at a University  in tho  United Kingdom.   Such  cases  arc not  likely to benumerous,-  and  it is  suggested that  if  they arise the &quot;Imperial Education Committee&quot;  might give consideration to  them and if  they  think the circumstances sufficiently exceptional to  justify it,  recommend to the Board of Education their  treatment on the spine basis as men ordinarily domiciled in the United Kingdom,  for tho. purposes of paragraphs S and 9 of this kei-icranduin.
