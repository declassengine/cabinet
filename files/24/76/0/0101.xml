The promise of the War Cabinet with regard to cereal     prices for 1919-20 is a matter of great urgency and gravity.               On November 19th, 1918, the War Cabinet considered the     memorandum (G,T. 6276), cn Cereal Prices for, 1919-20. in which     the President cf the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, the     Secretary for Scotland, and the Secretary for Ireland, concurred.     It was decided (W.C. 504, Min. 5) &apos;   that (a) the prioes paid for     controlled cereals harvested in 1919 should be net less than those     now current;  (b) the President of the Board of Agriculture     should arrange to announce this decision by means of a     Parliamentary Question that afternoon.               The form    the Question and  Answer, as approved en     behalf of the Cabinet by the then chancellor of the Exchequer,     was as follows:-              &quot;Mr. G. Lambert (by Private Notice) asked if the          President of the Board of Agriculture is abln yet  to say          whether the prices paid to farmers for controlled  cereals          harvested in 1919 will be not less than thrse now  ourrent?&quot;              &quot;The President cf the Board of Agriculture  (Mr. prothere):          Yes, Sir;  the  answer is in the affirmative.&quot;                (Hansard, Tuesday, 19th November, 1918, oel: 3324)               The oereal prioes current in November 1918, were, as     stated by the Board  of Agriculture in reply to enquiries:-          Rye and wheat,  75/6d. per quarter of 504 lbc,  or  71/lld.               per quarter of 480 lbs.          Barley  (malting) 70/- per quarter of 448 lbs.,  or  62/6d.               per quarter    400 lbs.          Barley  (feeding) 67/- per quarter of 448 lbs.,  or  59/lOd.               per quarter of 400 lbs,          Oats, 47/6 . per quarter of 336 lbs., or 44/ld. per quarter of               312 lbs.               The (estimated) cereal production of the United     Kingdom at the harvest of 1918 was:-          Wheat......  2,793,046 acres...... 11,643,00%) quarters.          Barley  .....  1,838,368   &quot;   ......  7,772,000     w          Oats.......  5,603,414...... 31,196,000     &quot;               It is very necessary that the Government polioyI    should be immediately announced before the spring sowings cf     whaat, barley and oats are completed.   whatever meaning is     attached to the wording of the Cabinet decision, an  obligation     has been created which must either be repudiated cr  defined and     fulfilled as nearly as p&amp;impossible.                                   1.
          Repudiation is,  it is  submitted,  out  of  the question.The only  course open to the Government  is  to define and  redeemthe pledge as nearly as possible,  with the  least possibleexpenditure of publio money.    In that case,  the following suggestions are made.     1,  Wheat.          The figures involved are as follows:-Country	Acreage under wheat.	Estimated crop 1918.England and Wales Scotland Ireland	acres. 2,556,661 79,059 157,326	qrs. 10,530,000 402,000 711,000Totals	2,793,046	11,643,000          The retention of some control over the Millersmight be justified by the probable oondition of the w^rld^grain markets for the next year.   Large stocks of wheat  arein sight in North America.   &quot;Whether they will greatly exceed the possible demand in Europe is uncertain.    But what appearsto be reasenably certain is that the capacity and transport facilities of Continental ports and railways and the purchasing power cf Continental Governments  will beinBuffioient to distribute and absorb the supply, howeverurgently it is needed.   Congestion will therefore follow in north America, and, in spite of President Wilson1s guarantee,may lead to a break in prices, and, as this  country wouldpraotipally be the enly outlet, to the delivery of wheat  inBritish ports at prices much below the cost  of production inthis country.   A break in the guaranteed prices is expected in America.   The United States are legislating for keeping faithwith farmers by reimbursing them for the loss they may sustaint?n the difference between the guaranteed and market prices fortheir 1919 wheat crop.          If control over the Millers is continued, it issuggested that the Government might contract with home-produoersto buy the whole home-grown crop of sound marketable wheat at anaverage price of 71/11 per quarter of 480 lbs, , subject to theusual terms of the wheat trade as to condition and time of delivery.          Such a contract would exactly redeem the Governmentpromise.    If the price guaranteed by President Wilson holds, itis approximately  that ofthe Government guarantee.   The  usualterms Gf the home wheat trade should be carefully settled inconsultation with the Wheat Commission before the Governmentprice is  definitely announced.   On the other hand, if imported wheat is  sold at a lower price than home-grown, the Governmentpurchase would afford opportunities for fraud, and no effective
check oan &quot;bo devised.    It should also  be  added  that  the  RoyalCommission cn Wheat Supplies is  opposed to the retention  ofcontrol over Millers for the necessary  period,          If control ever the Millers is abandoned,  or  if onany ether ground the previous suggestion is negatived,  analternative method of dealing with wheat is suggested.    Themachinery of the Corn Production Act might be applied to  the guaranteed price.     On this plan, farmers would be  paid  thedifference   between 71/11&quot; and the average market price,  ,ascertained for the seven months commencing September 1st,1919,on the basis cf four quarters to the acre  of their totalacreage under wheat.          This method would probably not be regarded by farmersas a complete satisfaction of the pledge,  as it  would not secureto them a market for their wheat.   On  the other hand,  themachinery already has Parliamentary sanction.   It is also themethod suggested for dealing with barley and oats.   Above all, itavoids the suspicion that the Government is maintaining pricesagainst the consumer.B.   Barley.     The figures involved are as follows:-Country	Acreage under Barley.	Estimated Crop 1918.England and Wales Scotland Ireland	acres. 1,500,809 152,847 184,712	qrs. 6,080,0C0 689,000 1,003,000To hospitals&apos;	1,838,368	7,772,000          Foreign Bourses of malting barley in 1919-20 will,  itis expected, be restricted mainly to the Stated on the Paoifiocca&amp;t of America.   Per this reason,, grain experts  o not anticipate an excess of supply over demand.   on the other hand,threatened discontinuance of brewing in the United States mayrelease enough foreign barley to fcree down the home market.Much will depend on the policy which the Government adoptstowards brewing and die ti Hung.   If these industriesapproximately resume their former activities, a market for home-grown barley will be created, which will absorb the quantityavailable for malting purposes, and, if grain experts areright, with no considerable reduction in priee.          In the *ase of brewing, for instance, it is estimatedthat, in or^er to produce the annual pre-war output of35,450,000 standard barrels of beer, 6  million quarters of barley, and barley substitutes equivalent to another two millionquarters, were used.   Approximately, one-third of the barleyused was imported.
          Barley, which is not of the quality required by brewersor distillers, commands a lower price for feeding purposes. Onlya portion is sold off the farms on whioh it is produced.          The guaranteed prices of malting and feeding barleyrespectively are 62/6 and 59/10 por quarter of 400 lbs.  Thisvariation makes it difficult to arrange payment on the acreagebasis of the Corn Production Act.  3ut a fair average between thetwo prices might bo struck by allowing a bias in favour of maltingbarley, as being the largest in acreage and the highest in price.If 61/6 were thus adopted, it is suggested that the- Governmentshould pay the difference between the guaranteed price of 61/and the average market price ascertained for the seven months beginning September 1st, 1919, on the basis of 4 quarters to theacre on four fifths of the total acreage under barley.     3.   flats.          The figures involved are as follows:-Country,Aoreage under    cats.Estimated Crop    1918.England and Wales.ScotlandIreland   acres.2,780.0611,243,8161,579,537    qrs.14,339,000 6,457,20010,460.000Totals5,6g3,41431,196,000          During tho  last  two y:?ars,. efforts have been made taencourage farmers to  grow  all the oats they could as foed forArmy horses and for livestock, or,  in the last resort, as humanfood.  On the 10 years average for  1904-13, the production of oats in the United Kingdom was 21,564,479 quarters.  As the importsof foreign oats for the ten years before the war averaged 5,790,303quarters&quot;, the country  (on  the scale of pre-war averages) wouldhave beoome self-supporting.  The guaranteed prices of both barley and oats are high as  compared with  the price of wheat.  In 1918-19no advance in wheat prioes was granted,&apos;mainly because a rise hadbeen already refused  to farmers in  the United States and becauseany rise in the price of home-grown wheat interfered with the &apos;financial arrangements for the 9d loaf.  Neither arguments appliedto barley and oats, the prices of which were raised.          It is anticipated that large quantities of foreign oatswill be thrown on the home market,  and that prices will be stillfurther lowered by cheap maize*  The interpretation of the promise there&amp;re becomes important.          In normal times, it is estimated that at least two-thirds of the home-grown oats of England and wales are consumed on the farms where they are produced and only one-third of the eropis sold.  The average  is higher in Scotland and Ireland.  The
object of the promise was to enable farmers to carry on their business in the usual way during the transition from war to peace.It was not intended to give them an opportunity of makingextraordinary profits by selling the whole of the oats that theynormally consume, and either buying them back at the expense ofthe Government, or replacing them by a cheaper imported food.On the other hand, farmers in the United Kingdom have inoreasedthe are1 a under oats 30 considerably that they would reasonably expect to sell  off their farms a larger quantity than thatnormally&quot; sold.          It is therefore suggested that the Government should offer to pay to producers of bats in the United kingdom thedifference between the guaranteed price of 44/- per quarter of312 lbs. and the average market price ascertained for the seven months commencing; September 1st, 1919,  on two-fifths or one-halfof the total acreage under oats on the basis of 5 quarters to theacre *                            i          It is further suggested that in purchases of oats forArmy requirements the military authorities should be required topurchase only  in the United Kingdom.EMLE.19/3/1919,
