                   2,769 acres at Kelham, Notts.                   2,377 acres (of which 1,606 are freehold) at Amesbury,                      7/ilts.            They are well advanced, and it is expected will &quot;be completed  in a  few days.  ,            The number of men employed on the Boards existing colonies  is 202,  of whom 21 belong to Agricultural Companies and 64 are ex-  service  men.   16 additional ex-service men have been accepted as  probationers, but have not yet started work.              * &apos;            Heavy rain during the week has greatly impeded field work  at Patrington and Pembrey.   At Heath Hill 60 acres were ploughed  during  the week,  but no drilling could be carried out owing to the land being  too wet.  At all three colonies hedging, ditching and dyking have been  in progress during the week.            The Hclbeach oolony was visited during the week by a  representative of &quot;&quot;the Department.   29 ex-service men are now in  possession of holdings;  of these 10 have 10 acres, and the remainder  5 acres.  2 other ex-service men, who are oompleting their service as  probationers, are expeoted to take up holdings during the month.   A  further  7 ex-service men are working on the central farm as  probationers, and 5 more have been accepted but have not yet started  work.   5 men from Agricultural Companies are working on the colony,  and 36 civilians.   The latter are gradually being replaced by ex-  service  men.            Owing to the wet season the winter crops are backward.  Great difficulty is being experienced in obtaining railway truckB  for the  removal of potatoes.   Only 80 tons could be dispatched during  last  month, and there still remain 1,500 tons to be disposed of.            A demonstration fruit plot has been arranged for on the  central  farm, and planting is to be commenced.fork of Agricultural Executive Committees.            During the war over 90 aores of first-class agricultural land  in and round Freethorpe in Norfolk were taken over by the Military  Authorities for aviation purposes.   Complaints have been made that  this  land has not yet been relinquished for cultivation.   The  Military Authorities have however now been requested to hand over  the  land  forthwith to its previous occupiers.       Arbitration on a Cultivation Order.   In December, 1917, the  Northumberland Agricultural Executive Committee served an order on  the Right Hon. Walter Runciman requiring him to plough up 106 acres  of grass on Bruntcn Parks.   The land was not ploughed, and the  Committee desired to prosecute Mr. Runciman, but the Board were unable  to authorise a prosecution as it appeared that Mr. Runciman was not in  occupation of the land when the order was served.   Mr. Runciman has  since become the owner of the land, and in Deoember, 1918, the  Ccmmittee served an order on his tenant requiring the ploughing up of  73 acres.  The tenant appealed against the order, and the arbitrator  to whom  it was referred has decided that it is undesirable in the  interests of food production that the land should be ploughed up,  and  I  foas awarded costs against the Board.       Determination  of Tenancies.  During the week two orders have been  issued determining  tenancies on account of bad farming in respect of  140 acres.  In one case arable land of the farm of 133 acres situate  I  at St. Erth, Cornwall, was reported to the Executive Committee  in      I  February, 1918, as being  foul, and the whole farm indifferently  cultivated, shortage of capital, capacity and labour being evident.
   THE Committee at that time served an Order dlrcoting the cropping of   45 acres for the 1918 harvest,  but in spite of many suhs^qucnt rioits   from the Committee&apos;s -officers,  the order was not carried out to any   adequate extent,    The Board,  after considering all the  circle stance^   have determined the  tenanev  in accordance with the  usual procedure   under the Corn Production (Amendment) Act,  1918.            -        PXP&amp;PJ&amp;MJZPJL:   A farmer at Boar stall in Buckinghamshire had been  -served in Lay last  by the Executive Committee with  an order directing   him to mow the grass crop, secure the hav,  plough and sow the field   by December 1918,     This order he failed to carrv  out,  and he was   accordingly prosecuted by the  Executive  Committee.    The Bench have   now convicted him on two  charges fining  him 15 guineas on each count   and 20 guineas costs.,   A farmer at Vi than- on- the -Hi 11 in Xesteven   who had been served  with  a cultivation order bv the Executive   Committee and which  he had failed to carry out,  has been fined  10   and  5 costs,Provision of Allotments,,. *    twin LI mitfm HHIWW .m*- WA^HIWMI tmta j-mi&apos;i ii             The Bo,ard!s Inspectors continue to stimulate the acquisi-   t-ion of land for allotments  by Local Authorities,    During the week   three more Looal  Authorities hove undertaken to acquire  under the   Cultivation of Lands Order 12  acres of land which will provide 182   allotments.    Various other  Local Authorities have  undertaken to   acquire altogether .200 acres under the Small Holdings and Allotments   Act. Lanji^Drainage, .        Dgaioige^Commjit^eqs.  An order has  been made for setting up a   Drainage QS.MIitse  for the -Vest Riding in addition  to the seven other   counties already referred to in previous Reports,        $^eachjinmSohajra J?enJ3anks.   This, breach has since last week&apos;s  Report been visited  bv renresentatives of the Department.   It was&apos;   found that the work  was being verv considerably hampered by the dual   control of the Kiddie Fen Commissioners  and the Executive Committee1s   So/rve^or,  and pressure was brought to bear on the Commissioners with   tne result that thev have now requested the &quot;Executive Co.-r.rn.lt be s to   take  complete control of  the work.    A culvert 2 ft, 9 in. in width   wnich helped to carrv away the flood water had been blocked by order   of the Commissioners bv planks and sandbags.   This obstruction has   now been removed and the  water flows freely in tne  drain leaving the   banks quite clear,    The  drain in question is about 6 miles long and   lead.? to the Prickwillow  Pumping Station,   It is understood that   one lands in the yicinitv of the drain at the Prickwillow end are   perfectly free from  flood .in spite of the removal of the obstruction   and are fit to plough,                          HOMLOyLOTAL^ DIVISION.         9.^rL-^majesty&apos;s^lsatJon,     A Circular  Letter is being addressed to   County Councils asking them  to set uo Horticultural Sub-Committees   under the county author it--&apos; responsible for Agricultural  Education,   which will include  the more  active members of the existing horticulture-   tural Sub-Committees of the  Agricultural Executive  Committees.        Prult&apos;^SejC t ion;    The demonstrations in fruit pruning in Norfolk   continue to arouse  the keenest interest  among growers, and the   series given in conjunction  with, the East Norfolk Fruit Growers&apos;   association hrve been well attended,.    Demonstrations and advice   have also been given in Herefordshire and Devonshire, and an   Inspection has been carried  out in  arwlckshire in  connection with   an orchard renovation scheme.
Small Live Stock. Rabbits. In view of the termination of war. The National Utility Rabbit Association in discontinuing work and its stock and ? at ? Will be sold. It hoped that the work of forming rabbit clubs in villages and ? towns, and of arranging for the disposal of rabbit flesh and ? will be carried on by the Rural League.

Poultry. A list of Poultry Keepers, willing to take pupils, is ? compiled with the object of putting ex-service men who seek ?ning in poultry keeping, in communication with those who are so ?ared and competent to give it.

Herb Growing. A visit was paid to the drying rooms of the ?rset Herb Industry at Taunton to inspect the samples of dried ?inal but mostly in small quantities. The samples of the ?ipal favourably with those prepared from cultivated plants. The ?rial is ? as it is gathered from natural ?. This is much against the production of good sample as leaves or roots are of various ages, and generally lack unifo? herb industry is to be made a commercial success, the material ? be gathered from cultivated plants.

Sub-Soiling. A visit has been paid to the Southend district to ?stigate the effects of deep tillage on soils of the Brick Earth ?. The bridk Earth soils are naturally very productive and ? forward; at the date of the visit, however, many of the fields found to be saturated with water to the ? of the plough?furrow, ?6 inches, but below that depth to be very firm and merely moist, ? which had been subsoiled, however, was firm to the tread and ? moist, but not wet, to a depth of about 18 inches; it was ? with peas about a week ago, and the crop went in well. This, ? is the only case of spring sowing in the locality. A striking ? of the benefit of subsciling is presented by two adjacent fields ? in wheat. One was subs?iled and worked on the flat and is firm ?dry. The other was worked on the narrow "statch"; water is lying ? furrows, and the stetch is a ? 5 or 6 inches deep. The ?oil plough is of the old-fashioned type, namely, a plough body ? the mould-board. It is drawn by two horses following the ?ry plough, which is also drawn by two horses; the combined Nations reach a depth of about 18 inches. The expenditure, before, amounts to the cost of an extra ploughing, and would usually ?curred once in a rotation. Even in this corner of Essex, ?gaining perhaps the most productive and the best farmed land in ?, it is clear that great advantages may accrue from the simple ?inexpensive process of subsciling.

Use of Ammonium Nitrate as Fertiliser. The signing of the ?tice enabled ? Ministry of Munitions to liberate large quantities ? itrate, which has considerable value as fertiliser. This ?sibility had been anticipated, and a series of experiments to test ?effects on mang?. potatoes and wheat were put in ? at ? in the early part of last year. The results have been ? in the February number of the Board&apos;s Journal; they show that ?ium nitrate is at least as useful as ammonium sulphate for wheat, ?mere useful for ?; it gave as good a crop of potates as ? sulpate, but produced a larger growth of haulm, which would a?disadvantage in districts where there was much disease. With ? of ? at £16.15. per ton and nitrate of soda at £20, ? of ammonia would be valued at £37.5. per ton. The Ministry of ?ions have agreed to offer ammonium nitrate for manurial purposes £25 per ton, f.o.r. Store, packages fee, and a press notice to this ? has been issued.


Labour Division.      Difficulties in Cheshire.   Enquiries  show  that  some of the l?orkers&apos; have ..  demanded  a wage  of  50/-  for  a week of  50 hours. tfhe position  is easier as action has  been deferred pending reconsider- lation of the  rates of wages  by  the  Agricultural  Wages Board.   The Board&apos;s Commissioner is  keeping in  close touch with both sides and it This hoped that  the threatened trouble  will be avoided.      County Labour, Committees.   Satisfactory progress is being made nth the&quot;formation in each County of  the Joint Committees of the Agricultural  Executive Committee and  the local representatives of the ilinistry of Labour to deal with agricultural  ^labour matters- /These Joint Committees comprise an  equal number  of representatives of farmers and labourers and will  doubtless become  valuable as permanentIbodieB for  the placing of men in agriculture, the organisation of[seasonal labour,  and probably iri connection with industrial conciliation      Labour and. Government work.^    The  Ministry  of labour has been con- suited during  the week &quot;as&quot; to &quot;&quot;the continuance of  the restrictions that were arranged  during the  war with the object of  preventing the attraction  of  agricultural, labourers  into Government works by the:joffer of higher wages.    It  is  looped  to maintain some modified arrangements  that will avoid to some  extent the  migration of farm labour through this mean.      Industrial. Conference.   A memorandum  has been prepared for the Industrial  Conference&quot;&quot;as  to  the number  of vacancies on farms and t , what number of men at present drawing the Unemployment donation oan be employed on agricultural, drainage,  or land  reclamation work.      Demobilisation.  An additional  22,528 agriculturists were demobilised during the seven days ended 5th March, bringing the total   \ number of such men released  to  that date up to 136,599.      Soldier Labour.  The number of  soldiers of Agricultural Companies demobilised during the week  was 4,362,  the  total number of men released from these Companies to date being 37,397.          The  war Office  have now agreed to leave on  farm work for the resent the soldiers an  the  land who  are eligible for the Armies of ccupation  owing to their having joined the Forces after the 1st January 1916.   The question of  the  disposal  of these men will be reconsidered when the number of men available for  the Armies  of Occupation is definitely  known.      Alien  Labour.   The  small  number of &quot;licensed&quot; enemy aliens and irapoBted Danes still cn  the  land is being withdrawn during the present month.                             Women&apos;s Branch.          The  demand for  woman  labour is increasing and cannot be met, and immediate steps  are being  taken to recruit and train a further supply.  The  recruiting  will be facilitated by  the fact that it has been decided  tc raise the minircum wage  for  women cf the Land Army by 2/6d. a week.    They will now receive 22/6d. for the  first three months1 agricultural work, which includes the period of  training, and after- wards 25/-  a week as the  minimum wage,  or as much more as can be earned under the  Wages  Board award.    This advanoe will take effect on April 28th.      Seasonal^labour will in future be  recruited through the Employment Exchanges&quot; Tnstead&quot;*of through voluntary  societies as in the past.   At the same time,  farmers requiring imported seasonal labour will continue to apply, when they so wish, to the Agricultural Committee Offices.                                    5.
     Tractor drivers.   There is an exceptionally r  &apos;large demand for I/omen tractor drivers, which it is difficult to meet owing to the fact that there are now no schools for training women in this work. Agricultural Executive Committees in the counties most urgently in need of tractor labour will, however, arrange for the training of their own recruits in future.     y/omen&apos;8 Institutes.   One of the latest Institutes to be formed is at Sandringham as a direct result of Her Majesty&apos;s interest in the movement.   Her Majesty has graciously intimated her willingness to be nominated as president.          28 new Institutes were started last week,  bringing the(total number to 916*                        Cultivation Division.          A number of counties have yet to make their final proposals with regard to the Tractor and Horse Schemes.   Generally there is a disposition to dispose of a certain number cf tractors (particularly those out of commission) in the near future, but to work the greater portion until the end of May.   The position after May is not so clear:  a few Committees with to retain practioally their full strength, some 25% and more, while some are satisfied that the harvest will be got in without the assistance of Government tractors. Arrangements have been made by which no tractor will be sold otherwise than in working order:  this rule will only be varied where the expense does not justify repair.   This will ensure that farmers get tractors which can be put on the land at once.     Tractor Scheme.   During the week ended 21st February, 1,363 acres were ploughed, 13 acres were cross ploughed and 29 acres were cultivated.     Steam Tackle.   The acreage dealt with during the past week is as follows:-  Ploughed 88, cultivated 96.   Total 134 acres.i.....,JrJH ?f Hor8fs, ggg Implements.

Horse sales during tjie past week have been velry satisfactory. 150 horses were sold:  the average price realised was 65 guineas. 27 horses sold in the tifest Riding of Yorkshire realised on an average 110 guineas.   Of tjois lot a five year old bay mare, in-foal to &quot;Ballam King&quot; realised 160 guineas.   A seven year old bay mare, in-foal to the same  sire, realised 146 guineas, and a five year old bay mare; in-foal to &quot;Scarcliffe Standard&quot; realised 140 guineas.                           Commercial Division.     Binder., Twine.   The makers have now reduced their wholesale price for binder twine to  115; 12. 6. per ton, which is equivalent io  125 to the farmer.   The price of hemp which at the date of the armistice stood at  100 per ton has again been reduced and now stands at  65 per ton.   In consequence cf this reduction it is by no means improbable  that a further reduction in binder twine may take place later on.     Max^meeting.   A  Conference with County Marketing  Societies has been held&apos;at which the future of the Societies was discussed.   One or two have already  a large turnover, while in other cases the local5.a.
conditions are sufficiently favourable to make it probablethat the co-operative sale of fruit and vegetables can bodeveloped if organised on a sound business basis,  Chore are,however, some Societies   which are unlikely ever to be ableto make a living out of fruit and vega babies, and in thesecases the proper coarse seems to be for the Society totake up general co-operative trading either by itself or inconnection with some other Society. &apos;          The question of the future of each Society will beconsidered individually and every assistance given in developingit along the most suitable lines-     Transport.  All the Societies represented at the aboveConference emphasised the fundamental importance of transport  and passed a Resolution &quot;pressing on the Board the importance of organising rural transport as rapidly as possible and pointing out that the distribution of perishable produce is at presentseriously prejudiced by lack of facilities,,     Seed ifctatoes.

PART IIB - Other Departments.     ANIMALS DIVISION.           Tho number of Swine-Jever outbreaks for the week has been 34 and the reports of-suspected cases 1-19.  There were onlyjt ovifrrecfcs of Anthrax confirmed an against 44 suspected cases&quot;reported.  Of Sheep Scab, there were 10 reports.  There was no case of rabies confirmed during the week and only 3 reports of suspected ceases received.           Another outbreak of Foot-and-Mouth Disease was confirmed to-day in the borough of  uddersfield.  The infected premises are inside an existing scheduled district but so close to the border that an extension of the district was deemed advisable,  The necessary Order has been issued and Local Authorities, police and railway companies informed.  The number of applications for licences to land dogs is still large, 103 having been received during the week.                         RATS ORDER, 1918.           The Draft Order amending the Rats Order was passed by the Orders Committee of the Ministry of Pood yesterday.  The-effect of. this Order, when supplemented by ths necessary Looal Government Board Order, will be to constitute the City of London, the Councils of the several Metropolitan Borough,?  and the Port Sanitary authority.es separate Local authority.es under the Order.  Further it will enable County Councils to delegate their powers, subject to such restrictions as they may impose:, to any District or Borough Council within their Administrative County or to delegate their powers to the War Agricultural Executive Committee.   These amendments will help to remove obstacles that have stood in the way of combined and effective mead-areas  In several districts the Local Authorities have put forward as the excuse of not moving, that it is no use their taking stops until their neighbours have adopted measures for rat destruction.   This &quot;Lord Chatham versus Sir Richard Sirfici&apos;.&amp;nr attitude of waiting for tho other to begin has resulted in much valuable time being lost, but this is not a new experience and as the example set by more enterprising Local Authorities spreads and the beneficial results of their activities become known, we shall doubtless find it easier to get the others to follow suit.                      VSTIiSRINARY DSPARTMijNT.      Swine-Fever material was examined in 50 reported outfra^ks in 36 of&quot;which swine-fever was found to exist.

There is a steady flow of applications  for  scholar-ships and for, farm training;  and no falling off in the  number  of enquiries - both verbal and written.   The fact that meetings ofthe Departmental Sub-Selection Committee are held weekly enablesScholarship applications to be disposed of rapidly,  and  un-successful applicants are therefore able to turn their attentionto other spheres of re-settlement.   A few unsuccessful  applicantshave asked for reasons of the Committee&apos;s decision in their  cases,but appear satisfied when an explanation is given them of the realobject, and limited number, of the Scholarships and of the largenumber of applications received.   Certain applicants have applied for. farm training as an alternative to a Scholarship.     Flax Production Branch.   The output of seed during the weekended 6th karch was 4,308 owts.

Large quantities of seed are now being shipped weekly tothe Flax Supplies Commit tee at Belfast.
          Good progress is being made with the  completion  of contracts for next season&apos;s crop, although in Somerset  therehas been some reluctance on the part of the growers  to  sit-;ncontracts owing to fears of labour difficulties at harvesttim*s.     Kelhan Estate,   Carting corn,  line,  swedes,  potatoes,  anddung, has kept the horses busy.   Fortunately the  bulk of  the ploughing was dono prior to the excessive  rain,  so the work  isnot much behindhand.   The labour position shows littleimprovement.   Six new men have been released from tho Army,and are working satisfactorily, but  (with  one exception only)no new skilled civilian labourers have been secured.          The wheat is now all threshed and has  yielded 637f qrs.from 207 acres (gross calculation).    The  late tenants&apos;  farmingmay possibly account for this poor yield.    It is  too  early  tosay whether it can be attributed to  the quality  of the land.                        Live Stock Branch.Duringweekended8 liar.Total since1 Apr. 1918.

The appointment of Crop Reporters continues to be the outstanding feature cf the work at the Branch,  and is nowentailing much correspondence with Reporters requiringfurther information as to their duties.          The agricultural schedule for 1919 has been sent topress, and preparation of the various forms dependentthereon is being rapidly pushed forward.          The returns of fish landed in February again showan increase, 320,000 cwts. as against  210,000  last  year, orhalf as much again, while the average value per cwt. shows adecided drop.
