uHALL     The Gorman &quot;Portia&quot; with 5 submarines left Heligoland forHarwich during the week..     &quot;Wolfhound&quot;,  &quot;Walpole&quot;  &quot;Violent&quot;,  &quot;Vectis&quot;,  and &quot;Vega&quot;arrived at Copenhagen to relieve 5 T.B.Dfs now in  the Baltic,      The French cruiser &quot;Montcalm&quot; and destroyer  &quot;Temeraire&quot;while cruising in the Great Belt on the  27th February capturedtwo German steamers steering&apos; North without colours *     Tho Supreme War Council has decided that no further move-ments of German troops,  supplies or coal from West to Eastbetween German and East  Baltic ports are to be permitted.as the Italians,  owing to their ciiiorences witn the jugo-aiare taking advantage  of the technicality that the lifting ofthe blockade is a variation of the  armistico terms.  Americaand Britain have  issued public notices of the resumption oftrade, and it is  not  proposed to cancol British sailings whiletho War Councilrs approval is pending.   France has not yetissued a public notice.     Tho Italian delegate to the Admiral^&quot; Committee firmly  intains the view of his Government that for&apos; obvious militarymai  roquisi-lanand Geographical reasons it is Italy*s natural right totion enemy&quot; ships in the Adriatic,  and that as the&quot;Italia^requisitionings before and sinco  21st December, represent theapplication oi  a general rule made by the Allies, the Committeehas no  right to scrutinise or sanction thorn, it only having thopower to examine and decide in&apos;exceptional cases.   The remain-ing delegates hold that the list  of requisitionings should bescrutinised, and that tho sanction of the Committee isnecessary - no requisition being  valid without sbt     AdmiralRatye, however, being in favour of Italy receiving preferential treatment in view of her position in the  Idriatic   TheItalian delegate further maintains that tho employment to whichrequisitioned ships are put is not within the jurisdiction of theCommittee,  a view to which the other delegates are  opposed? onthe ground that they cannot sanction a request to requisitionunless they know the reason for which it is made.  The ItalianGovernment holds that tho question of employment rests with theA.M.T.C. which has stated that it will not admit tho intor-vention of inter-allied naval committees, such as that of the adriatic.   These questions remain in suspense while thodelegates seek instructions from  their respective Governments.     The Italian Government defends its failure to carry out theorders of the A.M.T.C. on the ground that vessels are allocated for duties they are unable to perform, e.g. ships wore                                                  allocated
allocated to  the Australian service  which could not carry enoughcoal for  tho  voyage.   The A.M.T.C, has  accepted these explana- .tions.    Every  question of  the  use of ships&quot;as transports has to he referred  &quot;to&quot;the  Supremo War Council in Paris.&apos;     There  are  still  shipping delays at Fiurae, owing to want of organisation  and tho  unfortunate relations &quot;between the italian authorities and the French  base.  An improvement has been effected  as to  the  former,  but  it is almost impossible to over-come the  latter.   Practically all British ships visiting Fiumoare running on  French account&quot;.     There&apos;are  increasing signs of prosperity in the Spalatolocality,  and requisitioned ships are commencing to.runregularly.    The flag halliards&apos;of requisitioned ships are nowsealed  with lead seals,  in  consequence  of the American and AbM.T.0flags having  been hauled down on&quot;board a requisitioned ship at thePort of Jelsa,  by order  of  the  Italian Commandant, who has inconsequence been removed from office.     fee  situation  in the islands, and in tho town, of Curzolaespecially, becomes  daily more  serious, and disturbances of a grave nature  might  tako  place at any time, unless the generalconduct of  the  Italian authorities is curbed.  At present theyperpetrate  grave irregularities with absolute immunity fromconsequences  and a  detailed visit by an allied vessel might prove a check.     The  grievances in the  Island of Lissa appear to be trifling,,except  the  root complaint,that  although the inhabitants are almostunanimously in  favour of the new Slav state,  they are likely tohe placed under the Italian Crown, in which case they threatennot only  to leave  the island, but to oxhume and remove their dead.     The  Moslems of  Cyprus have protested against the agitationfor the union  of the  island with  Greece  and pray for a continuanceof British rule.     The  Greek War Office is  desirous.of stationing ls500 troops at Lemnos,  a moasure  which would  accelerate Greek demobilisation, for which the &quot;Allied Powers  are  pressing,   The barrackaccommodation  at Lemnos  is in British occupation.     It is  now proposed  to  send  Italian troops  to Konia,  insteadof the Adalia region.  General Allenby sees no  objection from amilitary standpoint, hut the  Foreign Office points out the strategic importance of  Konia in reference to control of theinterior of Asia Minor,  and also that any establishment ofItalians across the Baghdad railway at this point is not likelyto bo lightly given up&quot;and  might be projudicial to the Smyrna-Aidin Railway Company, which wishes to secure full control of tholine linking the 2 systems  and a section of the Baghdad main line itself.       The High Commissioner at  Constantinople  considers that thepresence of British  troops  at Smyrna, at this difficult juncture,is the one thing likely  to  assure peace and security,     Admiral Gauchet has been instructed to augment sweepingoperations on the Syrian coast  and to sweep the coast north ofEuad Island as soon  as possible..     British representatives abroad have been instructed to  .i?  5m.^e Governments  to which they arc accredited that duringtne British military occupation, no person mav land in Syria orPalestine without the  direct sanction of the L-E.P. headquarters at Cairo.Examination
      Examination  of vessels  destined for the  eastern mediterranean will he  carried out,  as and when considered necessary by  search at sea? no definite  examination ports being established.   [Representatives of  the Associated Governments atSofia,  Bucharest and Constantinople will transmit information                                               .jple and the black sea and also draw up  a list of ports to which all trade may haveto be forbidden.    Control of traffic on the,coast of Asia minor and on the Mediterranean coast of Bulgaria will be exercised bythe local Allied  Naval Authorities.  . &quot;A short contraband list has . been prepared.     Six ships carrying German troops for repatriation to a Germanport via Gibraltar have sailed from&apos;Constantinople and two-morewill sail shortly.                       CASPIAN ,,hM.     The seizure  of the Russian flotilla on the Caspian has .takenplace successfully at Baku without loss of life.    The WhiteEnsign has been hoisted on board all ships.    &quot;The Rear Admiral,  Black Sea has been directed to send anOfficer from the  Caspian to visit tho Military Mission atSkaterinodar in order to arrange co-operation with wn&amp;krm shouldhe advance on Astrakhan, the capture of which is  of very greatimportance to our Naval control&apos;of the Caspian.    machines    is still delayed as all her machines have not yet bssii dslivsred    but it is hoped that sho will sail shortly.                            MILSEA.         The Blockade of Red Soa ports from Cape Hali to Mokalla,    excluding Aden?  is to continue.              In view of the evacuation of the Turks from Yemen and    Asir, the Resident at Aden proposes as from 15th March to raise    the local restrictions on the export of kerosene oil and goods    other than thoso controlled by the Controller of Foodstuffs, and    also the restrictions on dhow traffic.         P..A.&quot; ,  Red Soa reports that  at a conference held with the    Military and Canal authorities it was agreed that pre-war dues    should DO charged to Army and Naval vessels as from the 1st    January and also that certain buildings and lands that have been    used by the  Navy should be restored to the Canal Company.

Considerable difficulties havo been put in tho way of the    repatriation of enemy subjects but it is hopod that the majority    will have left by .8th March.  &quot;SUFFOLK&quot; is in charge and has orders    to expedite the measure as much as possible.         The British naval personnel  at&quot; the front in Siberia will not    be withdrawn for the present.  HJLS.&quot;KENT&quot; will supply another    6-inch gun in place of the one originally lent from&apos;&quot; fi.fi.S. SUFFOLK    and which is now out of action.
