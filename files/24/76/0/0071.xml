  i ni8 Document is the Property of     ,;*    ;His Britannic t\&apos;*  -  Government.       METROPOLITAN  POLICE.(Circulated by  the horne Secretary)..      As the Cabinet are aware,  at the tine of the Metropolitan PoliceStrike in August last it was recognized that the  Police  should have bettermeans of collectively representing their grievances to the Authorities,and accordingly a Representative Board was  set up to represent the membersof the Force in matters connected with their conditions  of service andgeneral welfare other than questions  of discipline.   The Board was to be elected by ballot and they in turn were to  elect  a Committee of IE personswho should hold office for a year and should then retire but be eligiblefor re-election.   It was provided that in  the event of  a desire to bringmatters before the higher authorities a deputation of four delegates fromthe Committee should have &quot;instant and direct access&quot; to the commissioner in order to discuss the matters  in question.      The Committee elected has  sat almost  continuously  for the last six,months and the members if it have been withdrawn  from their Police duty for approximatly two days in every  three.-   The Committee have passed a largenumber of resolutions, many of which  have been couched in peremptory terns,and on the:  1st February the Secretary of the Committee  forwarded to thoCommissioner resolution ITo. 147, in which the Committee  &quot;emphatically -declined to accept a statement made by &quot;the  Commissioner&quot; ahd^requested that&quot;in future all comments intended to be conveyed to the Executive committee or the Board should be reduced to writing&quot;.    The Commissioner thereuponannounced in general orders that he would refuse  to receive as delegates from the Committee any of the men who were  parties to the drafting of that resolution, although he would be willing to receive such a deputation pro-vided that none of the members who took part in drafting the resolutionquoted above should form part of the  deputation.   The Committee thenapproached me with the request that I should receive a deputation upon thesubject.   This I refused to do, as in  my  opinion the terms of theresolution were clearly of such  a character as to justify the commissioner in refusing to receive any members of ^he Committee who  were parties to it,and further I considered it a matter  of discipline.      The term of the present Representative Board expires on the 3lstinstant, and it became necessary to arrange for the election of a new board.   The Commissioner drafted proposals for this purpose the maineffect of which was to establish three Boards, one for Constables, one forSergeants, and one for Inspectors, as it was found detrimental to have oneBoard for the three ranks.   He  showed the  drafts to the Committee whothereupon submitted a counter-draft,  v/hich,, in effect, would have placed the whole management of the Force in  the hands of the Repretentative Board:for example, the Board was to have (a) jurisdiction in all matters affoctinthe general welfare of the Force or any member without any exclusion of questions of discipline;,  (b) access  to all records, documents, books or
      any written matter ,v/hatsoeve,r-&apos;6Qiinerted&apos;with any subject of their      inquiry;  (c) the Executive Committee to;huve&apos; ppwer to cause the attendance      bef ore^them of-any member of the Metropolitan Police Force, which would      have inoluded power to summon the Commissioner before them.   They appended      to their proposed constitution a resolution that the Representative      Board is regarded purely as a temporary  instrument .of representation      pending the early recognition of the National Union pf .Police and      Prison Officers.&quot;   The Union announce in the Times of the 11th that they      have received resolutions from every division of the-force and branches      of the Union expressing the intention to have, nothing to/do with any    - . scheme of representation other than that p.eoe-iAfed/by the present:  .            .                      ,  .                 h    .  Representative  Board.                               -  ;     -  &apos;     The question of the recognition of the Union is at the, root of all      the trouble.   The Government decided in August last that the Union could      not be recognisedi but at the same time men were to be permitted to      join the Union &quot;so long&apos;as the.Union&quot; did not claim or attempt to interfere      with Police regulations or discipline or to induce members of the Force     to withhold their services&quot;.  This oondition.was agreed to bv the      Metropolitan Police Deputation received by the Home Secretary;  but how    -  far it has been fulfilled may be gathered from the fact that every announce-      ment. issued to the press by the Union contains a thinly- veiled threat that,      if the Government does not give way upon this&apos; or that point, the consequence-      will be a general strike of police throughout the country.   Within the      last week a ballot has been conducted in Manchester and other parts of     -Lancashire and certain questions have been put to the men,, one of which is  -    .- ^Are you willing&apos; to stand by your Union  in whatever actions if may&apos;be      decided to take regarding the full recognition of this Union by the Home      Office?&apos;!.   .,  .-.-&apos;&apos; .    &apos; &apos;-      The immediate question at- issue between the Commissioner and the-  &apos;.   present Representative Board relates to the refusal by the Commissioner to      receive delegates from the Committee of the Board who ha^e taken part in      drafting an insolent resolution and 1 propose.to uphold the action, of -      the Commissioner.        .  .            The main question, however,&apos; is the recognition of the Union&apos;and as      this is likely to become acute in the near future I should be. glad to have      the decision of the War Cabinet upon it. &apos;  In my opinion the experience      of the last six months and the working of the present Representative      Board largely composed as it is of the leading officials of the. Union,   &quot; -have only confirmed the view that the Union must on no account be recognised      if the Metropolitan Police and Police forces throughout the Country.arc:      to continue disciplined forces, under the control of their ,Authorities.         V .1 ask for a decision of the War Cabinet to that effect.&apos;lltli i.(arch..&apos;l919.       . ,  -            -             &apos;    E.S.           .  ,  .
