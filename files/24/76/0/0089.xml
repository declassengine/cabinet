The  Minutes of  the  Committee relating thereto        are circulated herewith.   Attention-is drawn to the following        decisions  of  the Committeesrnative             &quot;A person appointed  to be  a member  of the panel \  2^     of official valuers shall not  engage in private practice or          business, as ^state or  Land Agent, surveyor or Valuer.&quot;                   The Committee decided  that a clause should be          inserted in place  of  this to provide that:-                   &quot;Valuers who  continue  in private practice and          their partners should be debarred  from giving evidence in          disputed cases where  a  public  authority seeks to  acquire          land.    (Vide minutes  of 2nd  and  3rd meeting). ie 5(5)            The Committee decided  to omit these clauses which1(6)/torment    relate to the deduction from the  amount of compensation^es.      awarded  of  -          (1)  the value by which other land  belon;;in;- to the               claimant is or is  likely  to be  enhanoed by the               carrying out  of  the scheme for  which the land is               being acquired.          (2)  the value by which the land  to be acquired has been  ,               enhanoed by the  execution of  public works since               January 1st 1910.                   The Committee arrived at the decision on the ground          that  the whole question of betterment or injurious affection          required comprehensive treatment  in  a separate enactment...                      (Vide minutes of 2nd meeting).511se 4(1)            &quot;No.parties to the proceedings shall be allowed  (b).,.   to appear by Counsel or by Solicitor except with the         consent of the official valuer.&quot;:HIS OOCUM::;:NT  IS     PROPERTY OF HI?

                   The Committee decided to delete the Clause.                          (Vide Minutes of 3rd Meeting)vuse 8 of the       It was decided by v&apos;ar Cabinet Minute 539,- Mini&apos; 1lftlng     (b) that Clause 8 of the Housing Bill shoUld be incorporated         In the Land Acquisition Bill.   The Committee desire the         further directions of the Cabinet &quot;on this matter for the         reasons set out In the draft minutes attached;, which may         be summarised as follows              1*-.   That the Clause would be incongruous in the  Land                  Acquisition Bill; and should be restored to the                  Housing Bill.              2.   That the Clause having been borrowed from the  London                  County Council Resolutions without the safeguard                  provided by those Resolutions would excite opposition                  in the House of Commons, and would seriously obstruct                  the passage of the Land Acquisition Bill.

Mr. Evan Davies,    Mr. A.V. Symonds.    Mr. C J, Howell Thomas.Mr. Pembroke Wicks,             Secretary.acquisition         THE COMMITTEE considered the Clauses of theLL.           Bill seriatim.                  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL stated that the Bill had             been referred to the Committee by the War Cabinet for             the consideration of a few points remaining un- .             settled.  It w^s not the intention of the Cabinet             that the.Bill should be enlarged by the Committee.                  MR. LESLIE SCOTT said that he had consulted             Mr. Bonar law with regard to the attitude of the             Cabinet in relation to the amendment of the law             as to the existing powers to take&apos;land as distinct             ;frora the question of the assessment of compensation.             He had suggested to Mr. Bonar Law - &apos;.                  (l) That the amendment of the law was of                   :extreme importance on general-public                      grounds- - &apos; &apos;-                  (2) That it Was desirable that the terns of  &apos;                      this Bill relating to co:mpensation should                      be-consistent with the larger scheme to                      be introduced hereafter.:                  Mr. Bonar Law had authorised him to say that-            - he was prima facie in agreement with this view and           -  requested him to raise at the Committee the de3ira-             bility of introducing legislation with a view to             their advising the Cabinet thereon.                       The matter was deferred for consideration                       at a subsequent meeting.
    The ATTORNEY GENERAL stated that the Cabinet were inclined to favour the alternative Glauses, subject to the-inclusion of the wording of the Finance 1909-10 Act, 1910,in terms instead, of referring&apos;to the Act. by its title.    SIR FREDERICK LIDDELL stated that Sir Howard Frankhad protested against the exclusion of official valuers:fram private practice on the grouni that -         (1) unless valuers were in private practice             they would get out of touch with market             conditions;         (2) it would be impossible to attract men of             the necessary qualifications and eminence             in the profession except, at a salary which           -  would be prohibitivec    MR, LESLIE SCOTf said that he believed it would benecessary to (iff er a salary of  5, *X)0.  The Committee r*nLand Acquisition in their Second Report had&apos; recommendedthat private practice should be allowed for the samereasons as those given by Sir Howard Frank, the onlylimitation being that they must not give evidence indisputed cases so long as they remain *m the Panel ofValuers.    SIR FREDERICK LIDDELL pointed out that it would benecessary to exclude nany valuers who had partners in private practice    Some discussion tcck place as to the number ofvaluers that would be necessary.     SIR ARTHUR B0SCAv&apos;EN said that a large number wouldbe required at the beginning, gradually decreasingajRter the Land Settlement Bill and Housing Rill had beenin operation for some time.  Probably.ten or twelve;would be required at firsts    -  -    MR. LESLIE SCOTT said &quot;that his Committee had been driven by a process of elimination to their proposalto allow private practice.  They were satisfied with theevidence before the$ that in no other way would Itbe possible to get men of the necessary reputation and ability.  A proposal to appoint for a certain term ofyears would be very difficult to carry out.  Profession-al men would be unwilling to give up their practice and then return to it afterwards.  Security of tenurewas an important element in securing the right kind ofman.    THE LSRD CHANCELLOR pointed out that there was nosecurity Of tenure provided by either Clause   It vo uldlie very difficult for the Ccmmittee to come to adecision.  If there were to be twelve Valuers it wouldinvolve 748 ,000 a year,    THE ATTORNEY GENERAL said that the Cabinet had considered at some length the proposal to adapt a tribunal analogous to the Railway and Canal Commission,and were definitely against it, and were also against allowing private practice.  He considered that theCommittee were bound by the Cabinet instructions towhole-time valuers, and that the question of security of tenure was a matter for the Treasury toconsider.
        SIR.FREDERICK LIDDELL pointed out that the War Offioe  found that they often got &quot;better valuations from  local surveyors than from anyone else.        It was  stated that Lord Ernie had expressed the opinion that the salaries of the valuers would he saved ten times over  by saving the expenses of the Lands    .;- Clauses Acts.        THE LQRD CHANCELLOR pointed out that it had.never been contemplated to revert to the procedure of the Lands Clauses Acts,  It ought to be made plain that a  serious financial burden was involved and,that it Would net be possible tg obtain valuers of the requisite qualification and reputation without paying a high  salary.  If the. Committee were to adhere to their instructions that private practice was not permissible then  there must be security of tenure, but it was impossible to give security of tenure if the work were going to decrease as had been suggested.  Unless the Treasury were prepared to pay  5\000 a year he thought that  the valuers must be allowed private practice.  If the Treasury woul$ pay  $,000 a year, he thought they could get a good class of man and any objection would disappear.        THE COMMITTEE decided          To request the opinion of the Cabinet as to          whether the Committee were bouni by Cabinot          instructions to retain-alternative Clause 2,          which prohibits official valuers from          engaging in private practice, or whether the          Committee were at liberty to consider the          question on Its merits.        MR. LESLIE SCOTT drew attention to the words  . &quot;shall  se far.as practicable act on his own knowledge &quot;and  experience&quot; in the first line of the Clause whic/. ho considered might be road -as altogether authorising a  valuer to disregard the evidence.        SIR FREDERICK LIDItBLL said that the words occurred in several existing Aots of Parliament,        THE COMMITTEE decided           To refer the point to. the draughtsman to           consider whether it was necessary to insert           other words to make it clear that it was not         .  the  intention to exclude evidence.        MR. LESLIE SCOTT suggested that in Sub-section 1. the  costs of one re-investment should be allowed where such expense was. actually incurred.        SIR. ARTHUR BOSCAW pointed out that tho Small Holdings and Housing Acts made no allowance for the costs of re-investment.        THE COMMITTEE decided          - That the words should not be inserted.
I               MR. LESLIE SCOTT drew attention to Sub-Section 2...          and suggested that if the words &quot;to a willing buyer&quot;          were not added after&quot;a willing seller&quot;,, the effect          would- be in some cases to make the price practically that          of a forced sale on the open market.               THE ATTORNEY GENERAL said that the words &quot;willing          buyer&quot; had been omitted lest they should have the effect          of increasing the price of property which was in fact          unsaleable.   The words were practically the same as          those of Section 24 of the Finance Act. 1910..                   The Committee decided to leave                   Sub-Section   unaltered.            - .      ,;ction          THE ATTORNEY GENERAL stated that objection had  6 .      been taken in the Cabinet that these Clauses so far as          they related to betterment were a kind of halfway          house and a little illogical.   Clause 5 discriminated          against owners from whom land was taken as contrasted          with those from&apos; whom no land was taken..   If the Clause          were retained in the Bill the man whose land was taken          might have to pay for betterment by the decreased          amount of compensation he received, whereas his neigh.-          bour who might be equally affected by the betterment          would have to pay nothing.    The question for the          Committee was to. consider whether the whole question          of betterment was to be covered by the Bill.  The          Chancellor of-the Exchequer, on.the other hand, had          made the suggestion that a public authority might be&apos;gi**en          the power to purchase any land which the owner claimed to be          injuriously affected  and that the owner of iand against          whom a public authority raised the claim of betterment          should be empowered to compel the public authority to          purchase his land,               THE LORD&apos; CHANCELLOR agreed that the mere accident that          and-man&apos;s land had been taken should not&apos;render him liable          to a claim for betterment, as contrasted-with&quot; the owner from          whom no.land was taken. &apos;               After some discussion the Committee decided nem con                 that Clause 3 (5), and (6) should be omitted&apos;&apos; from                 the Bill, with a view to the whole question, of                 betterment and injurious affection being considered                 comprehensively as a separate&apos;measure.ilause 9.       THE ATTORNEY GENERAL drew attention to the definition          of &quot;public authority&quot;.and said that the &apos;question had been          raised as to whether the powers, in the Bill might properly          be extended to railway Companies trading for profit-  It          was suggested that powers might be extended to all public          utility societies on the ground of national interest.               MR. LESLIE SCOTT said that the test of national interest          could not be confined to public undertakings.   It was          equally applicable in tiie case of important private works.               THE LORD ADVOCATE suggested that the real test was that          railways and other similar undertakings were in fact under          some form of State control, e.g., the Railway and Canal          Commission, Board of Trade, etc., whereas private under-          takinps were under no control.- 4 .
             THE ATTORNEY GENERAL was  of  opinion that  the  Clause        should be allowed to stand as  it  was.             The Committee decided to  leave  the  Clause              unaltered.lause.        THE ATTORNEY GENERAL stated  that  it had been        strongly held in  the Cabinet that as this Dill        would have to deal mainly with Housing,  it was        preferable to include in the -Sill Clause 8,- of the        Draft Housing Bill dealing with the  acquisition        of slum property.             The Committee decided                To adjourn the consideration of  this                matter till their next meeting on                Wednesday, March 12th, at 5  p.m.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.     11th March,  1919

BILL O^MfOTTEE , &quot;Minutes of Third Meeting held on March 1-2th 1919,at 5 p.m., in the Lord Chancellor&apos;s Room, Houseof Lords.         PRESENT.The Lord Chancellor  (chairman)The Attorney-General  (Vice-chairman).Major Aator.Sir A.

LAND ACQUISITION BILL.ase 1.       SIR HOWARD FRANK enquired whether the parties would       be at liberty to agree upon an arbitrator or whether reference       to the panel of official valuers was compulsory.  It was       most desirable to have the right to agree upon an outside       arbitrator.  Many of the valuers at present on the panel       of official valuers under the Finance Act 1910 were not       suitable for trade cases and in  -many oase3 it would be       greatly to the advantage of the Government if an outside       arbitrator were chosen.            The committee decided :-                (1) that reference to an agreed arbitrator                    should be permitted and requested Sir                    Frederick Liddell to insert worsts in                    Clause 1 to that effect,                (2) that the general provisions of the Act                    with regard to costs should be made to                    apply to the costs of an arbitration                    before an outside arbitrator.            THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that since the last meeting       he had further considered the proposal (Clause (2) of       the alternative clauses) to exclude official valuers from       private practice and was. of opinion that the arguments       were overwhelmingly against it,^Unless the Treasury was       prepared to sanction salaries of  5,000 per annum it would       be impossible to get any but the oldest men since you
could not offer security of tenure and valuers  in thefront rank with &quot;big practices would not &quot;be willing to relinquish them for an official appointment and returnto private practice afterwards.     THE ATTORNEY GENERAL said &quot;he knew the Prime Ministerattached great importance to the point.  At the same  time he felt bound to say thae he recognised the practicaldifficulties were very great.     SIR HOWARD FRANK said that he was strongly cf opinionthat private practices should be allowed for the reasons give by the Lord Chancellor viz:  that you would not  getthe best men unless you could offer a high salary and security of tenure.  You oould not get good men to give up their practices.  It was, moreover,  his experience  inarbitrations that the arbitrator must have a full practicalknowledge of values and he felt that an official valuerwho was excluded from private practice would&apos; very rapidlyget out of touch with market conditions which alteredvery quickly.     The secretary said that he had consulted the private secretary to the chancellor of the Exchequer during theabsence of the latter in Paris,  While it was not possibleto have an authoritative Treasury opinion  until hiareturn there would almost certainly be very strongTreasury objection to appointing 10 valuers at  the salarynamed at the last meeting ( 5,000 per.annum) a3 thatrhich would be necessary to secure men of the requisitestanding and qualifications.  The Treasury objection was based on the fact that there were only a dozen technicalappointments for which salaries were paid at rates higherthan those given to heads of Departments,  in those oasesthe salary was about  2,500 and it was not desired to  add to the number,  it appointments were made at  5,000 there&apos;would be great difficulty in resisting the oiaims ofCivil servants to similar treatment.     THE ATTORNEY GENERAL said that nobody would suggest that valuers would ast improperly if allowed tocontinue in private practice, but their minds would beunconsciously influenced by their ordinary  vocation.If, a valuer were to give evidence one day for a landownerand another day for a promoter he would be putting himself in a position which was not compatible with that of a judge.     MR. LESLIE SCOTT suggested that following therecommendations in the second report of the committee under the Ministry cf Reconstruction cn the Acquisitionof Land, valuers might be allowed to continue in private practice provided that so long as they remained on the panel they should not give  evidence in disputed, casesbefore official valuers, and that their partners shouldbe subject to the same restriction.
              THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Bald tlv-it in tnat case an         official valuer would not bo entitled to givo evidence         in ariothor arbitration before --.ny raombor of tho panel.         On reflection ho thought, that might go a long way         towards mooting tho Prime iuinistor1a objection.  A       ,  valuer who sat as a judge would never appear AS a         witness in a case where a public  authority was concernod.              SIR HOWARD EiAISK said he would have no objection         to that proposal.   Ho was only anxious to ensure the         appointment of practical men as arbitrators.  Hor did         ho see any objection to extending the veto to tho         partner of an official valuer.              ELS COUMITTES decided:-  ,                  (l)  That alternative Clause (Z) should                       bo d-rioted:                  (2)  That Sir Frederick  Liddell be requested                       to draft a clause to bo inserted in tho                       Bill providing that valuers who continue                       in private practice and their partners                       should bo debarred  from giving evidence                       in disputed cases before an official                       valuer:                  (3)  That the inettor bo  reported to tho                       Cabinet for thoir consideration.lause 3(2).    Some discussion took place initiated by Mr. Howell         &apos;Thomas as to the position of yearly tenants who  - though         having no saleable interest could under the procedure         of the Lands Clauses Acts be awarded compensation         before twt justices,  No provision was made for this         in this 3111.              THE ATTORNEY MERfiX said that the intention of tho         Bill was that it should apply to  all cases to which a         Government Department is &amp; party  even cases of injurious         affection where no land was taken, and the question of         trade disturbance was intended to be dealt with In this         Bill.  Tho Committee requested Sir Frederick Liddell to         consider whether it was necessary to make further pro-         visicn for the case of yearly tenants.!^use 8        THE ATTORNEY GENERAL said that tho Cabinet had  tho     decided that Clause 8 of tho Housing Bill should bemusing    removed bodily from that Bill and inserted in tho Land         Acquisition Bill.. d(Jho scheme of tho Land Acquisition         Bill had been, to lay ftho general  principles for         determining compensation where land was acquired by any         public authority and it had been  contemplated to make         special provisions for special clashes of esses  in         special Acts of. Parliamentt e.g.   tho Housing&apos;Bill.         He therefore recorded it as incongruous to insert this         Clause in tho Land Acquisition Bill., but he felt the         Committee were bound by tiu decision of the Cabinet.              SIR FREDERICK LIDDELL said that tho clause  in  question         was taicon from the Resolutions of tho London County Council         but under those Resolutions it could not come  into operation                                     -3-
until 5 years had  &quot;-xpircd, the delay &quot;be in- given inorder to allov&apos; tho landlord an opportunity to ro-ontor and put his property in ordor.       THE ATTORNEY GENERAL agreed the clause had boonborrowed from the County Council without the CountyCouncil&apos;s safeguards.       SIR ARTHUR B0SCAWE1N pointed out that there were a number lof landlords who if thoy had a pbwor of re-entrywould clear away tho slums at once       MR, -.5HSI0KDS pointed out. on the other hand thatthere was no obligation on private landowners to re-housetho tenants, and consequently the housing difficulty would beincreased by the &quot;holesalC clearance of tho slum areas bythe landlords.       THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that ho ^ould bo disposed to refer the clause bach to the Cabinet r&quot;ith a recommendation that they should insert a provision in favour of the land-Owncr.   The Clnuse as it stood -ras indefensible.       -MAJOR ASTOR said that Dr. Addison &quot;as very strongly against allowing the landlords a period of grace.       THE ATTORNEY GENERAL pointed out that tho right of entry without a period of grace ^ould be purposeless andfutile.&quot; . He suggestcd-that the Committee should recommend to, the Cabinet that:-       (l)  That Clause was more appropriate to the Housing            Bill than the Acquisition of Land Bill.       (2)  If it  is to be inserted in the Acquisition of            Land Bill it  should be in.a,form ,:rhich &quot;ill            not prejudice the rest of the Bill, in other            words  it ought to go in with  5&quot; years1 safeguard.       MAJOR ASTOR said the Local  Government Board couldnot wait $ years. .&apos;       MR. LESLIE  SCOTT suggested  that tho Housing Authoritiesaoquirc  immediately subject to the general rules ofcompensation provided by  the Bill  and would bo able to acquireat the specially reduced  rate after $ years if the landlordha4 not  by then exercised his right of re-entry.       THE ATTORNEY GENERAL pointed&apos; out. that by Clause 3  (4-)of the.Land Acquisition Bill the owners of slum propertywould  in any event not be able to  claim by way  of compensa-ti*n the full amount of income thoy received from the property,       THE LORD CHANCELLOR observed that  Clause 3 (4.) tothat extent would  overlap with Clause 8 of the Housing Bill.       THE  C0;3 ITTEE &apos; decided            to refer back  to tho  Cabinet tho            instruction to incorporate Clause 8            of the  Housing 3ill in  the Acquisition            of Land Bill for further directions  in            the light of the above  discussion.
aUse              Some discussion took place on Clause 4  &quot;No          party to the proceedings shall be allowed to appear          by Counsel or by Solicitor except With the consent  of          the official valuer&quot;.                 THE LOHT CHANCELLOR said that he thought  there          would be great difficulty in getting this Clause through          the House of Cordons.&apos;                 MR, LESLIE SCOTT pointed out  that there was          an alternative of limiting the amount of a claim          below which counsel and solicitors might not be          employed,                 MR.  SXMONBS said that the usual practice of the          Local Government Board was to allov  counsel but  to          limit the number of expert witnesses.               &apos;  THE LORD CHANCELLOR pointed out that where a          landowner had a large  BUB&apos;, possibly  his whole fortune          at&quot; stake, unless he were allowed to  be represented  he          would be at the mercy  of the official valuer               &quot;  MR. LESLIE SCOTT pointed out  that in the          absence of legal advice at the hearjng the right of          appeal to. the High Court r&apos;would  be rendered nugatory.                 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL sa:! d that no doubt there          would be great difficulty m securing assent to  the          clause.   It was felt,  however.  that in a great  many          oases there would be no need, for legal assistance.          In the&apos; cases where it  was proper to  have it, the valuer          would be only too glal to avail himself of the assistance.                 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL pointed  out in reply to the          Lerd Chancellor that under Clause ?  (3) the official          valuer had po^rer to disallow the. costs of counsel.                 THE COMMITTEE decided                      to delete  Clause 4 (l)b  but to retain                      Clause 4 (l)a which directs that not                      more than.one expert witness shall be                      heard on either side unless the                      official valuer otherwise directs,                 MR. LESLIE SCOTT suggested that the Tribunal          should&apos;have power to instruct an expert to go and examine          the property.   He regarded this as  a weapon in  the hands          of the Tribunal to control expert witnesses by having at          command the evidence of an expert not employed by either          of the parties.                 THE LORD CHANCELLOR said it was an unusual po^er          and questioned whether it would be useful.                 THE COMMITTEE decided                      not to adopt the suggestion.t- 5 -
                MR. LESLIE SCOTT suggested  that  the  parties  should be           allowed to call on the Inland Revenue Department  for  any           existing valuations and that  the Inland Revenue valuer           who had made the valuation should be  allowed  to give evidence,           and be cross-examined;j                MR. HOWELL THOMAS said that the  Board  Inland           Revenue would have no great object;! on, but  in view of           ministerial pledges that information  obtained under the           1910 Act would net be used for other  purposes, it was           very doubtful whether It would be wise to suggest it.                The Committee decided                       not to ad&apos; pt the  suggestion.Clause 5;       MR. LESLIE SCOTT pointed out that there           was no provision for separate interests in  the same           property being assessed at the same time.                The Committee decided:-                       that Mr. Scott should confer  with                       Sir Frederick Liddell on the  point.                On the suggestion of Mr. Leslie &quot;cott                 The Committee decided that words should be                     inserted to ensure  that enquires  under  the                     Bill should be heard In public  and  re uested                     Sir.Frederick Liddell to prepare  tho                     necessary clause.suse 5 (2)1     MR. LESLIE SCOTT suggested that this  clause           which requires a claimant to  give particulars of           his claim in writing should be drafted as in  Para. 29           of the second report of the Land Acquisition  Committee                     &quot;The claimants should be required to serve                     on the promoters full particulars of his claim                     which should state  the exact nature of  the                     interest in respect of which compensation  is                     claimed and details of the compensation claimed                     distinguishing the  amounts under separate                     heads and showing how the amount claimed under                     each hoad is calculated.r1                 The Committee requested Sir Frederick Liddell                     to redraft the clause accordingly.leuse 5(1)   -   MR. HO-ELL THOMAS suggested that authority be given           to deduct not onl3r the costs  of the promoters but also           the costs of the award.                 The Committee requested Sir Frederick Liddell                     to consider this. Clause 6.        MR. LESLIE SCOTT sugrested that either (1)  a  right           of appeal should be given from a decision of the  High           Court with leave of the King1s Bench Division or  Court           of Appeal or (2) that questions of law should be  referred           direct from the official valuer to the Court of Appeal           as in the case- of  the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts without           further appeal to  the House of Lords.  After tome discussion                 The Committee decided;-,                     not to alter the Clause. I                                     -  6 -
 Clause  7  (1)             The Committee  decided to  omit  theft                   words in brackets  &quot;whether passed or made                    before or after  the- passing of this Act&quot;.Clause 8.-               Application to  Scotland and Ireland,.               It  was  stated that  the  necessary modifications had not               yet been received from  the  Scottish Office and the               Irish Office.Clause. 9.               MR. LESLIE  SCOTT raised the question  as  to               whether public utility  Societies trading for  profit               should  be included  within the  definition of public               authority.                     The Committee decided that the decision come                         to at the last meetins? should  stand as                         recorded  in the draft minutes, vis:                         Public Utility Societies  should not be                         included.2&quot;,  Whitehall Gardens, 3   12th March, 1919,
