Committee)  which- reported, in  January  1918. &apos;  Lord Cave, was Chairman of the   Committee at the date of  its  report and all the departments chiefly concerned.   were represented on the Committee.         Before the War the  only powers  which the Houc  Office possessed were con-  .  ,   tained in the Aliens Act,  1905, i.he effect of which  briefly.was to control the   immigration of immigrants  in  immigrant ships chiefly from Eastern Europe who   intended permanently to remain here,  and  to provide  for the expulsion of in-   dividual aliens who were  either convicted by a Court and recommended for   expulsion,  or had become  ohargeable to the rates within a year after their   arrival in the country.    These powers were very incomplete-arid there can be &quot; no doubt that  they failed to&apos; prevent the&apos; immigration&apos;of a number of undesirable   aliens and also that-many undesirables were left in  this country owing&quot;to the   reluctance of Courts to recommend expulsion.   There can, I submit&apos;  be no   question of returning to  this Unsatisfactory condition..         At the outbreak of  War, as the  Committee pointed out, &quot;a much more drantio.&apos;   control of aliens immediately became  necessary, and  the day after the declara-   tion of War the Aliens Restriction Aot, 1914, was passed empowering His&apos;   Majesty in time of war or on  an occasion  of imminent national danger or  great   emergency,  by Order in Counoil to impose restrictions on aliens and. to  make.   provision for measures of exolusion,  deportation, arrest, and generally  drastic .   supervision and control.    These powers have been carried into effect by   successive Orders in Council, and now constitute a very full code adapted to   war time for the supervision  of aliens  in this country.   The Aliens Aot, 1905, ,   has not     been in any way formally affected by this legislation and the Orders.   in Council thereunder, but its operation  has been largely superseded by  these   more drastic measures,and, in particular, the control &quot;now exercised at the ports;   both on the admission and embarkation of  aliens,  is  organised solely under the   Aliens Restriction Order.&quot;         The passing of a new Bill is now an urgent matter  in view of the limita-   tion of the Aliens Restriction Aot referred to above.    I propose to meet the   case by continuing and amending this  Act.  The provisions  of the Bill are   explained in the memorandum prefixed  to it, but I desire to draw the attention   of the War Cabinet specially to these pointst-         (l) As recommended by the Committee,  the procedure by Order in Council   is retained.   This procedure will no doubt be nritized  in  Parliament, but I   am satisfied that no other method is  possible, as the Government cannot  at the   moment draw up any statutory scheme  of restriction  on aliens whioh would meet   the conditions which rapidly change with  the  change  of  international oonditions.   The procedure by Order in Council enables the  Government to meet the circumstances   as they arise and it has  certainly proved very valuable  and effective  during   the War.
      (2) The most substantial addition to the Act of 1914 is  con-tained in Clause 2 of the Bill whioh (a) renders  aliens&apos; who atter.pt  to cause mutiny, sedition or disaffection liable to  severer punishment  than british subjects and (b),oreates a new ^ffenoe* namely,  the promotion&apos;by aliens of industrial unrest (as distinct from  particular trade dis-putes in which the alien may himself be concerned).      (3) It is proposed in the Bill that the Aliens  Act.  1905.  shall be repealed when prosvisions covering the same ground,  so far as  necessary.are made by Order in Council.    One effect will he to remove the statutoryprotection against exclusion from,this country which was provided by theAct of 1906 for the political refugee.   Similar  protection could, if and when required, be provided by Order in Council,  but  it is  suggestedthat the changed and changing circumstances of the world  and particularly of Russia (whose subjects were the main object of the right of asylumembodied in the Aot of 1905) render it unnecessary and ,  undesirable  tomaintain this statutory provision.     I venture to&apos; hope that the War Cabinet will  give me authority to pro-ceed with the Bill and find time for its passage  before  Easter.                                                  &apos;.

Aliens  Restriction  (Amendment)  Bill                         MEMORANDUM.     The Aliens Restriction Act of 1914, which was passed on theday after the declaration of War, confers  power to make orders in Council imposing  restrictions on  aliens, which power is limitedto a time when a state of  war  exists  between  His Majesty andany foreign  power, or  when  it  appears  that  an  occasion  ofimminent national danger  or  great emergency  has  arisen.   TheAct enables  provision to be made-    &quot; (a) for prohibiting  aliens  from  landing   in the United Kingdom,  either            generally  or at  certain  places,  and for imposing  restrictions  or            conditions on aliens landing or arriving at  any port in the United            Kingdom ;  and    &quot; (b) for prohibiting  aliens from embarking in  the  United Kingdom, either            generally or at  certain places, and for  imposing  restrictions  and            conditions on aliens  embarking or about to embark in the United            Kingdom ;  and   .&quot; -(c) for the deportation of aliens from  the. United Kingdom;  and    &quot; (d) for  requiring  aliens  to  reside  and  remain  within  certain places or,      .      districts ;  and  .  &quot;(e) for prohibiting  aliens from residing or remaining  in any areas specified    ,        in the Order ; and    &quot; (/) for requiring  aliens residing  in  the United Kingdom to comply with            such  provisions  as  to registration, change of abode, travelling, or ;.   ;      &quot;otherwise as may be made by  the Order; and      -          ,:    &quot;((/) for the appointment of  officers to  parry the Order  into effect, and; for            conferring  on  such  officers and   on  the  Secretary of State  such            powers as may  be  necessary or  expedient  for the purposes  of  the            Order ; and    &quot; (A) for imposing penalties  on persons  who aid or abet any contravention of            the Order,  and  for  imposing such obligations  and  restrictions on            masters of  ships or any other  persons  specified in the Order as            appear necessary or expedient for giving full  effect to the  Order ;            and    &quot; (i) for conferring  upon  such persons as may be specified  in the  Order            such  powers with respect to arrest, detention, search of premises or            persons, and otherwise,  as may  be  specified  in  the Order, and for            any  other   ancillary  matters  for  which it  appears expedient to            provide with a  view to giving full effect to the  Order;  and    &quot; (k) for any  other matters  which appear  necessary or expedient with  a            view to the safety of the realm.&quot;     It  is  under  the  powers conferred by the above  Act thatthe various  Aliens Restrictions Orders have  been made duringthe, war, dealing comprehensively with the landing and embarking     44-3                        a
 of aliens in the United Kingdom,  the  delimitation of  prohibited areas, and the  registration  of  aliens,  and  imposing generally from  time  to  time  such  restrictions  on  the  movements  and behaviour of  aliens as have seemed necessary.   It is  proposed by the present Bill that this power  of making Orders in  Council should be made  available  for  exercise at any time.  The  Bill, however, provides that if orders are made which are to  operate at a time when  there  is no war or special emergency, they shall be laid on the table of both Houses, with a  right  to petition for their annulment in whole or in part.     The  Bill further  extends  the  power  of making  Orders in Council  in  order to meet  necessities which  have arisen, and in particular in order  to  enable  aliens who  have been interned as  prisoners of war to be  kept in custody until six months after the declaration  of  peace, and  to  enable the1  existing information as  to enemy property to  be supplemented where  necessary and made as complete as possible.     The Bill also contains a clause  rendering aliens who attempt to  cause mutiny,  sedition, or  disaffection  liable to  a  severer punishment, than British  subjects guilty of similar proceedings,and imposing a penalty in certain  cases on  aliens who promote industrial unrest.  *   The provisions  of the. Aliens Act of  1905 will be covered so  far as necessary by Orders  in Council  made  under the Bill,and the  Bill accordingly provides for the  repeal of that Act.
