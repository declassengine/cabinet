HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 01; HIS BRITANNIC  majesty&apos;s  GOVERNMENT. )CRET.WAR CABINET,T.6912.RELEASE OF SINN FEIN PRISONERS.Memorandum by Lord French-.       In view of the appeals which I,  in conjunction with the Chief Secretary,  have made  to  our  Colleagues  to  sanc- tion the immediate  release of the  Sinn Fein prisoners,  I desire to place on  record my reasons and the cause a  which have induced me to  think that the  opinion which I had hitherto held and expressed on  this subject is  no longer applicable to the actual situation at  the moment.       It is not necessary for me to dwell upon  the con- ditions under which these prisoners are now confined; for they are well known to all  the Cabinet.   Before  the Armistice was signed their detention was not only legal but absolutely justified.   As,  however,  the justification rented entirely upon the danger of a German invasion of Ireland this can no longer remain  now  that the  German menace is completely removed.       To exercise a legal right in an  arbitrary manner&apos;ls  had policy unless  sufficient reasons exist to  continue to  exercise that right  after.the original cause of justi- fication no longer  exists.       At the time when  the Armistice was signed on the 11th of  November,  up to  the  moment of the assembly of  the so- called Irish Parliament,  I held the deliberate  opinion that those sufficient reasons existed  in abundance.       The whole Autumn  wa^ occupied with a crusade in the interests of Sinn Fein  at the General  Election.   Much intimidation was in evidence to influence to vote.   The confidence in ultimate  political ascendency encouraged further outbreak of crime,  and  raids for arms and out- rages by irresponsible  supporters  greatly increased.      These measures succeeded in- their object and the whole of the South  and  Middle of Ireland was practically represented by Sinn Fein in the new Parliamnet  which was announced on December 28th.       After the General Election an atmosphere  of Sinn Fein triumph-pervaded the  whole country;   all kinds  of evil predictions were made by responsible people  of  all shades of opinion.   The country was politically in the most restless condition in which I have ever known- it, and I felt very strongly that thetfe could be no question of  any release of the prisoners until  a different state of  affairs prevailed.
      Early In Jammry I e:xpres-s.ed th&amp;se vLe*-s to s^nsY^lmembers of tho Cabinev, among &apos;o there to \ord Curson and toiv altor Long.  Ry fears that action would be taken withoutmy sanction or knowledge were aroused by the fact that count riunkett was released from prison and was at large in Dublin addressing public meetings before * heard any-thing about it.  I understood subsequently that this re-lease had been granted on the ground of til-health, butthis did not prevent Count Plunkett from raking wee ofhis liberty actively to place himself at the head of the sinn Fein Party,      I come nov to the reasons which have caused me tothink that tho time has arrived to change this policyand prompted the urgent messages which I sent through theChief Secretary to my Colleagues.      The Sinn Fein Party is composed broadly speaking ofthree sections:-  (a)  Constitutional Home Rulers, who supported Sinn Fein        in order to destroy the Irish Parliamentary Party.  (b)  Theoretical Republicans,  (c)  Anti-British and &quot;physical Force&quot; men.      Section  (a) though the least active and articulate,comprises the vast bulk of Sinn Fein strength.  Section  (b)consists of visionaries and intellectuals who have no crimln-al or revolutionary leanings.  These have little influence.Section (c) which is the smallest in number is most aggres-sive, actively disruptive, and dangerous in the highest  de-gree.  The first two sections are disciplined and loyal  tothe present controlling powers in the Sinn Fein organization,and^ihere is constant Internal strife between these sectionsand the more advanced one.      Up to the date of the meeting of the &quot;Irish Parlia-ment&quot; on January 21st, there can be no doubt that the SinnFein Party vere largely under the influence of the dangeroussection (c), and that the other sectionowere blindly followingthem in ignorance of their true objects,      A few days after the meeting of Parliament, however,one of those &quot;ost extraordinary and sudden changes became evident in the general Sinn Fein atmosphere which are sowell known by  all who have been brought into contact withIrish politics.      The Irish peoole can stand anytl. ing except derision,end when the leaders of an Irish movement make themselvesinto a laughing stock before all the world their leader-ship is doomed.       I have  established  the  means  of  following  very  closely the variations of  current  thought  in  Ireland,  and  I was  very soon made  aware of  this extraordinary  change,       I did not, however,  consider  that  the  time  v?as  ripe for an  actual  move  in  the  direction of  an immediate releaseof the  prisoners until  the  strikes  in  the  North  occurredand a  very  dangerous  crisis  was  at  hand which  might plungethe whole  country  in  disaster,   Bolshevist  propaganda  was undoubtedly at the  root of  -hose  strikes,  and  it  came tomy knowledge  that  a close  alliance  exists  between  thisBolshevik  element  and  the  advanced  Sinn Fein Section  (c)
       Further,  it became evident that this  Bolshevik  - advanced &apos;-;imi Fein - combination was  utilising  the  case  of the prisoners in Ireland to cover&quot; their  revolutionary as- piration-   Mcr^fVer,  I found out that this junction  with the Bolsheviks  was condemned in the  strongest manner  by  the real f,inn Fein leaders such aa John Mc^HeiU, De Valera and Griffith 3.       The Moderate parties (a) and (b) are  being absolutely alienated frominoderatec.  courses by the feeling  that the continued imprisonment of the  inn Fein  leaders without trial,  although it may be strickly speaking legal,  is with- out justification.       In addition to all I have said  there  came the extra- ordinary effect produced by the murder.of the police  con- stables at Tipperary.   This sent a shock through every part of the country and made foamy stspporiers of Sinn  Fein think very seriously over their position.   The  act  was vigorously denounced by Sinn Fein generally, who say  that,&apos; in their opinion, it Is but the natural  effect  of t e with- drawal of De Valera from his position of responsibility, and the assumption of that responsibility by men who are  nade reckless by what they call the injustice of the Government towards their loaders.       I understand that the Government considers that the&quot;release of the  prisoners at the present  moment  would  be  an act of weakness.  That might be so if the imprisonment were effecting any good results, and  if  it  could be pro- longed.  But the Government could hardly lose credit  or&apos; strength in yielding  now to reason  what it will be com- pelled later on to yield after public clrmour and turbu- lence in Ireland.   The agitators will not  fail to  press the point that these men are held in prison  on  the  plea of appre- apprehended &quot;invasion or other military emergency arising  out of the present war&quot; for months after the signing of the armistice.     ,  As I pointed out above, the justification has virtual- ly ceased although the actual legality doubtless remains until Peace is  signed.  My deliberate opinion is that the psychological moment has arrived when these prisoners should be released, and I am supported in this  view by leading men both in and out of the Governments        .  .       I would urge that     time is  of the  utmost importance, and express the earnest hope that the Cabinet will  im-.mediately acquiesce in what is the unanimous recommendation of the  Irish Government.(Intd)   F.7th February 1919.
