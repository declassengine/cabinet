Memorandum for the War Cabinet by the First Lord of the Admiralty.          In reference to the  letter from the  Chief Secretaryto the Prime Minister, about tho Irish prisons and the releaseof convicted prisoners,  I desire to cay that I concur in all  he says about Irish gaols,  which are I know thoroughly unsatisfactory,          As regards the releaoe of the prisoners, I opposedtheir release when suggested the other day,  because I thought itwould gravely complicate the action of the Government in regardto Labour unrest in this country:  I am not sure that there isnot something to bo said from this point of Mow now.  otherwise the course I would venture to recommend io that all the casescf men and women interned without trial, 3hould be considered together, and that if possible,  any&apos;action that is to bo takenshould apply to^ the United Kingdom 33 a whole and not only toIreland^          A3 regards  Ireland,  I feel that it is our duty tosupport the Irish Government when they are agreed and have con-sidered any criticisms that other members of the Government mayhavo thought it right to make; and I need hardly say that I havethe greatest confidence in tho judgment of the Lord Lieutenantand the Chief Secretary.                      (SIGE3D)   W.  H. LONG3rd March,  1919,
