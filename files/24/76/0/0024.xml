With reference  to  Minutes 4 and 5 of the 2nd Meeting, theChairman invited  Sir  Arthur Steel-Maitland, who  had not  been present at  the Meeting, to submit such observations as he mighthave to make.     Sir  Arthur Steel-Maitland said that  he observed that sub-committees had been appointed to. deal with  these matters, and hesaid  that he would arrange for one  of his staff to get into touchwith the Sub-Committee on Passports and Permits so that it mighthave all the information  before  it  that  it  might require.  With[1205]-287B
regard to the arrangements for  travellers  proceeding  overseas,  hewas having a scheme prepared which  he proposed to lay before theShipping Controller.    Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland said that there were a lot of businesspeople who had very little knowledge of the procedure that was now necessary to enable them to. trade.  The big firms, of  course, were fairly familiar with the various technicalities, but the smaller firmswere not, and they were constantly applying from all  parts of thecountry to his department for information.   He felt sure that if  hecould increase his staff and have proper office  accommodation  hecould greatly help bo  revive the export &quot;trade,  as  his  department would then be in a position to  guide business  people and  advisethem not only on restrictions on  trade that existed in this country,but also  in regard to restrictions  in foreign countries.  He also thought that some sort of publicity ought to  be  kept  up.  TheMinistry  of   Information  had  in the  past arranged for  certainpublications  in South America  which  had  been  dropped.  he understood the Americans were doing this  sort of thing, but so  faras he knew  only through  their trade  institutions.  The  british trade Federation was beginning to do some of this  work  and tohelp firms in this country, but they had not got properly going, andthey said that they were not in a position to deal with the positionadequately.     The Chairman said that if  lack of office  accommodation was really holding up  the revival of the export trade  then  it was avery  important  question.   He  suggested  that  Sir  Arthur Steel-Maitland&apos;s point might be met by establishing information bureauxin various parts of the  provinces.     It was  suggested  that this  work was the function  of theChamber of Commerce, but Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland  stated thatnevertheless  the enquiries received in his Department  amounted toa very large number.   Sir Alfred Mond said, on the  question  of office accommodation,that an extension of the Foreign Office building  had been contem-plated, but that it had been stopped owing to lack of materials, and,he added, in  regard to  Sir  Arthur Stee)-Maitland&apos;s point,  that hehad been given to understand that the Overseas Trade department was shortly to be absorbed in the Board of Trade organisation^     Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland said he had  heard nothing of that,and he added that, while his Department  must remain associatedboth  with the Foreign  Office and the  Board of Trade,  what  he desired was that it  should  be housed within a  reasonable distance of each.     It was decided that:      (1.)  That the question of the desirability  and (or) necessity of            establishing an  information bureau  of the nature sug-            gested by  Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland, either at his head            office or  in  the  provinces,  be  referred to  the Sub-            Committee appointed in Minute 3  of the  2nd  meeting            to consider the  question of passports and permits, as an            addition to their terms of reference, and that Mr. Butler,            of  the Overseas  Trade Department,  be  added as  a            member of the Sub-Committee.      (2.) Enquiry be  made  of the President of the Board of Trade            as to  the prospective position  of  the Overseas Trade            Department.      (3.) It was essential that the Overseas Trade Department should            have adequate  office accommodation, and that subject to            (2) above, the locality of the  Department should be in            the vicinity of the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade.     * This paragraph was subsequent])&apos; discussed at the Seventh Meeting of the  Conference, and it was then decided  that the wording of this paragraph should be  amended as recorded in the Minutes of that Meeting.
The Possibility of        2.  The Chairman mentioned  that  this was a very  importantgiving^Employment   branch  of tbe subject which                                            was before  the Conference, as it opened011  U 10   01CS&quot;     UP ^ne financial aspect  of all these  questions,  and he proposed to                  take  first of all public works, excluding housing, land settlement,                  land reclamation, drainage and afforestation, and then to take these                  exceptions separately.Public Works.            )n Addison said that public works, with the exceptions referred                  to, and  excluding  roads (other  than those necessitated  by  the                  housing scheme), were divided up under  various groups, and he                  quoted  figures which showed that there were public works to cost                  about 11,000,OOOL, either in progress or fully authorised, and in the                  case of  which the local authorities were willing to proceed, and that                  there were other public works to the cost of 16,482,0001, with which                  the local authorities were also willing  to  proceed but were not yet                  fully  authorised.                      Dr. Addison then drew attention  to  a letter which  the  Local                  Government Board  had  received  from  the Treasury containing the                  Treasures sanction for the carrying out  of certain schemes (including                  housing), with, however, certain qualifications, which would make it                  necessary for  application  to be made to  Lord Colwyn&apos;s Committee                  where  it was desired  to exceed  the sanction  contained in  the                  Treasury&apos;s letter.  It seemed to him  that from the point of view of                  unemployment,  which  they  were considering, what had to be                  considered was what loans  by local authorities should be sanctioned                   and  they proposed to do all  in  their  power  to  induce  the                  larger local authorities to borrow on their own account -in respect of                  works to cost 11,000,0001., and how far the local authorities were                  likely to  proceed  with such works.  He  thought this  was  more                  important than considering the actual nature of  the works, which,                  he pointed out, were limited by Lord  Colwyns Committee.                      The  Chairman pointed out  that  the amount that  could  be                  borrowed would be a limited sum,  and he laid stress on the fact that                  the employment that, should be offered should be of a varied nature.                      Mr.  Montagu questioned whether  the stimulation of building                  would  help employment, as it seemed to him that  the cause of the                  unemployment in the building trade was want  of materials, pivotal                  men, and, above all, the unwillingness of private persons to build.                      Sir Stephenson Kent said that building contractors were cancelling                  their contracts  because  of the uncertainty of the position, having                  regard  to the probable absorption of materials by the Government.                      The  Chairman thought that  trie  reason for unemployment in                  the building trade was the cessation of building in aerodromes, which                  left  large units of  unemployed,  the  shortage  of materials, timber                  difficulties,  and a certain  shortage of pivotal men, other than  those                  contained in the units referred to.                      Mr. Chamberlain said that what  the Treasury wanted, and what                  they had never had,  was a statement  from Dr.  Addison, and also                  from Lord  Ernie, of what money they required  for their schemes,                  how much could be  usefully applied  in the coming year, and how                  much it would be necessary to raise by Government  borrowing.  He                  emphasised the necessity of making local authorities who could do so                  borrow on their own market credit, and he gave an indication of the                  total amount likely to   be available  on  local loans funds for all                  purposes, namely, 30,000,0007.                       The Chairman said  that the question  before them wTas as to the                  best  way of  spending that 30,000,0001 from the point  of view of                  getting public works carried out in such a way as  would meet the                  problem of unemployment.  He said that the point that had to be                  borne  in mind  was as  to whether  the  credit of the country was                  sufficient to carry its population, and, in his opinion, this question of
credit was at the root of all the points they were considering, and itwas essential that, in some manner or other, steps should be taken tomeet it within the next few months.    Dr. Addison said he thought that the credit of the country was satisfactory, and that what was at the root of their difficulties wasthe question of the revival of trade.    After further discussion, it was decided that     The President of the  Local  Government Board should  arrange         for his Department to prepare for the Conference analyses         of the  public works  contemplated,  in  terms  of  their         potential values from the point of view of labour absorption         and  relative cost (including differentiation  between local         authorities who might be in a position to  borrow and those         who  might not be in such a position).    Mr. Montagu drew attention to the fact that assuming that thesum available for these various  purposes  was about 30&apos;millions, and assuming that the housing scheme and the land settlement scheme were estimated to cost respectively 10 millions and 20 millions, it was difficult to see how  it  was  proposed  to  provide  for  the  largeexpenditure on public works which had been referred to  by  Dr.Addison.   He laid stress on this point because the housing schemeand the land settlement scheme  were matters which the Governmentwere pledged to carry into effect.    The Chairman agreed that this was a very  important  point, andone that laid stress on the necessity for discovering  the  relativevalues of the  various schemes that were in contemplation from  thepoint of view  of absorbing labour.    Sir Alfred Mond spoke as  to the  public works that  were in contemplation by the Office of Works.   He  said that the building work they had in contemplation was chiefly Post Office work, and itwas estimated that after three months&apos; work 10,000 persons would beemployed on it.  The&apos; total estimate for the Post Office work was 5 million, which would be spread  over a period of three years.  Theproportion in  the next financial year would be about 1^ million.  he deprecated building more  than was necessary, as he  thought such apolicy might conflict with the Government housing scheme.     It was decided that: -     Sir Alfred Mond should arrange for a schedule  to be prepared         for the Conference, showing the classes of work  that were         in contemplation, and the  amount of labour that it  was         estimated these  classes of work would absorb.     Mr. Illingworth  said  that  the  engineering programme of the Post  Office was carried out by  them entirely, and that the  estimate was 8 million, half of this being for maintenance and half for  new works, and all their orders would be.placed in this country.  He referred to the difficulty in regard to the telephone system, and he pointed out  that, as  matters  were  at present,  there would be difficulty  in  the  way  of supplying,  to  any large  extent,  new businesses in  the cit^y with the necessary apparatus.   He mentioned that the Post Office was in arrears in executing telephone installations to the extent of over 200,000,  and,  out  of 800 applications weekly in London, Only 200 could be dealt with.     The completion of  the Post Office Tube was being held up until metals came down to a more reasonable level.     Mr. Chamberlain pointed out that they had discovered that there were large stocks of raw materials held by the Ministry of Munitions, and he could not see why an  arrangement  should not  be come  to between the Post Office and the Ministry of Munitions, whereby the Ministry should hand over such  materials as were  required.  The point as to, what price the Post Office&apos;should be charged was quite immaterial to the  Treasury,  and  was  a  matter  of arrangement
Land Settlement.Land Reclamation.between  the two departments, but  it  seemed  to him  perfectly-unnecessary for the Post Office to wait for the price to fall when thematerial was already in the hands  of the Government,  and,  if notsupplied to the Post Office, would have to be sold later to the public at a loss.    The  Chairman said  that this  was a curious  case  of one department waiting for  another  to- bring down  the price, and  hewondered  whether a similar situation  had  arisen in  regard  to railway material.    It was decided that     (i.) The Postmaster-General to arrange for figures to be supplied           to the Conference indicating how  much of the 8 million           estimate would be absorbed in wages,  and how much in           material.    (ii.) The Post  Office and the Ministry of  Munitions  should           arrange forthwith that  the former department obtain the           necessary supply of raw material without delay.    (hi.)  Mr.   Chapman  should  make  enquiries whether  the           difficulty in regard to obtaining raw material for railway           replacements was analogous to that which existed in the           case of the Post Office.    (b.) Mr. Chamberlain said that he thought before the Conferenceconsidered this  matter,  it  would be useful for  him to have  aconsultation with Lord Ernie  on the  subject.  He mentioned thatit would  appear  the scheme wras  proposed  to  apply  not only to ex-service men, but to everybody, and with this he could not agree.    Lord Ernie  said that  he  thought  himself that  the  scheme should be limited to ex-service men, but  that  there was a strongbody of opinion which  held  that men who had not been allowed tojoin the colours  should also have the opportunity of settling  onthe land.    It was decided that     The  Chancellor of  the  Exchequer  and  the President  of. the         Board of Agriculture confer  on the subject and report the         result to the Conference.    (c.) Lord Ernie stated  that  two  main  questions presentedthemselves in connection  with reclamation, namely: How to obtainland by reclamation, and what  price should  be paid  for it.  Thelandowner would  claim a high price, and argue that he  was justified by  reason of the  fact that value of the land would  be enhanced  bythe improvements that  would  be  wrought upon  it. He  had been authorised by the  Treasury to spend  the sum of 1,000,OOOZ.  onreclamation, and  he hoped to obtain powers by the acquisition ofLand Bill to enable him to  carry out  his scheme.  If necessary,possession  could   be taken   under the  Defence  of  the  realm regulations.    He gave one or two  examples of land reclamation throughoutthe country.  There was an area about 8 square miles at Wareham,which could be reclaimed at  a cost of about 51. an acre, and wouldprobably be worth ultimately  about  201. an acre, so  that,  from a financial point of  view, this scheme had something  to commend it inconnection with  the question  of  land settlement for ex-soldiers.Again, schemes were formulated for the  reclaiming rof parts  of the yorkshire moors  for grass pasturage.  The labour which would beemployed  would  be almost entirely unskilled, under the supervision of a few skilled gangers,  but he feared that the scheme would not produce any valuable solution to the unemployment problem, owingto  the fact that  the conditions of the work would discourage theunemployed men  in town areas from volunteering for such work.    Mr.   Chamberlain   recalled the  decision of  Lord  Selborne&apos;sCommittee, which  came to the conclusion that from  the point of&quot;[1205]-287
Land Drainage.Afforestation.Deforestation.GovernmentHousing Scheme.view of solving the unemployment problem, reclamation of land wasuseless, and he drew attention to the fact that the vast proportion ofthe unemployed population in  this country at the present time wasto be found in the  towns, and that that class of worker would be most  unsuitable for work of that  description.  If, however,  LordErnie proposed that  the labour  employed on this work should consistof ex-service men, who would ultimately settle on the land they had worked on, he had no objection to the scheme.    Sir Stephenson  Kent expressed the opinion that in so far as theunemployed  population consisted of ex-soldiers, it was not, perhaps,altogether unsuited  for  work,  such  as  reclamation of land  largelyentailed.    . (cl.) Lord Ernie proceeded  to deal with the question of drainageof the land.   He said that no grant from the Treasury had yet been authorised, but that there were many millions of acres throughoutthe country which could be made more profitable by a proper  systemof drainage.   The landowner would, of course, profit by any such&apos;scheme,  but he  feared that if drainage work was left to  private individuals,  little or  nothing would  be  done, although he hoped that something might be accomplished by affording the private landownerassistance in the  way of  provided labour.    He agreed with  Mr.Chamberlain that the idea of making a Treasury grant for improve-ments  to private property would be difficult  to carry through, as aprivate landowner should  carry out his own  improvements,  but hecould see no other way of getting drainage works carried out.    (e.)  The Chairman then raised the question of afforestation, but,in the absence of Mr. Acland, who was in charge of the  interimforestry authority, the consideration of the matter was adjourned.    In the course  of discussion, however, it was  agreed that a con-siderable amount of employment might be given by carrying out theschemes  of  afforestation, but  here  again no  real solution  of  theunemployment  problem  would  be  found, as  the work would  notattract the unemployed population in the towns, but  would,  if any-thing,  tend  to  deplete  the man-power  available  for  agricultural purposes.    ;(/.) Mr.  Pease mentioned  that 75 per  cent, of the  pit-propsrequired would have to be obtained in  this country, and he pointedout that this would provide employment, particularly  in view of thewithdrawal of the Canadian forestry companies.    ((/.)  Mr.  Pease stated that, according to his information,  therewas at present a labour shortage in the West Riding  of Yorkshire.    Mr. Illingworth confirmed this statement,  and  said that  he understood that  the reason was that there was not sufficient housing accommodation for all the  workers  who could  find employment inthat part of the  country.    Dr. Addison said  that, up  to the 21st January, he had receivedapplications for the building of  10,506 houses.  Schemes  were onlynow beginning to  be  brought  before him ; last  week he had givenapproval to fourteen schemes, which  entailed  the construction ofGOO houses.  In view, however, of the fact  that a thousand localauthorities stated that they wished to build, and he had only receivedfifty-two definite  schemes up to the end of  January,  he was notin a position at present to give any useful figures on the subject, buthe thought that this was not a  satisfactory state of affairs, and he was having enquiries made.  Probably no contracts had been  placed  upto the present, and there was some difficulty  in connection with theacquisition  of land,  but he hoped that by  the  passing  of the&quot; Acquisition of Land  Bill&quot;  he would  be  enabled to  carry outschemes more quickly.  He agreed that this Bill was  the real basis vof the scheme, and mentioned that already it  was  found necessary i:
to acquire 246 sites.  He added that in  his  Housing  Bill  he was proposing that, when once the acquisition of a site had been sanctioned,the local authorities should be able to start work at once,  without waiting for the usual preliminaries.    Mr. Pease said  that  he  feared  that the cost of buil&apos;ding  acottage was  a greater difficulty than the cost of acquiring the land,and he thought that local  authorities could only build houses at a cost of about 10 to 20 per cent, higher than what it would cost a privatebuilder to carry out the work.   He suggested that, to get houses built quickly,  it was necessary to encourage the private builder aswell as the local authority, and that a subsidy should be given at adecreased rate according  to  the time  at which the houses werefinished  (e.g., 40 per cent. On the  cost  of  approved plans for  allhouses completed and ready for  occupation  within  twelve  months,and for houses finished later decreasing 10 per cent, for each month),so that the  subsidy would gradually disappear,  and  the  buildingwould then be carried on,  on an economic basis.          -  .    Sir Stephenson  Kent expressed  a fear  that a scheme of this nature might tend to encourage jerry-building.    Mr. Pease replied that  he  thought this  objection  could  be overcome if the local  authority  inspected the  plans prior to  thecommencement of  building operations, and also the  completed workprior  to the houses being occupied.    Mr. Montagu drew attention to the  state of affairs in country districts,  where existing  cottages were in an appalling  condition,and also the labour  available  was  totally inadequate  to meet requirements.  There  was  the additional difficulty in the country that  if a builder  put up a cottage  new he must  charge  a higherrental in order to recover  the high expenditure entailed.    Colonel  Amery remarked that private builders  were holding-back  all over the country  because the)&apos; knew they could never get aneconomic rent on the present high cost of building.  The only thing to,do was to come to a rough decision  as to  what future cost wouldbe, and to give the builders the difference as a bonus,  with possibly a further small bonus for speedy building.    The Chairman remarked that it was not an  exaggeration to saythat  a million new houses were required  in the  country at thepresent  time, and in such  a  serious position,  he thought  that thequestion should most earnestly be considered of obtaining powers  tohelp Public Utility Societies by means of a subsidy,  which would go some, way towards meeting  the point  made  by  Mr. Pease  and colonel Amery.   A very important point in connection with thescheme was the supply of materials.    Mr. Drower said that the difficulty in restarting brick  fields, sofar as labour was concerned, was  not  in  getting  pivotal  men  out ofthe army, but in  securing  casual labour required for  clay mixing.This  class of labour would receive a  comparatively low wage, whichwould be at least 30 per cent,  less than the rate which had been paidin aerodrome construction of a similar kind.  Owing to the  fact thatthere  was   little  competition, brickyards,  as  a whole,  were  notup-to-date  or enterprising,  and  they must  in  many  cases  bere-equipped.  Larger brickyards did not want subsidy so  much  asorders  to induce  them  to commence  work, though a  few of thesmaller  concerns might require  assistance to  obtain  the necessary machinery.     He estimated that the output  of bricks in  the last year of thewar was  600 million,  whereas the output just before the  war hadbeen  rather over 3,000 million, the greatest output in any one recentyear having been 3,600 million. The scheme of the Local GovernmentBoard  would require about  6,000  million bricks, which, at  the
present &quot;rate, it  Would take  about three  years  to supply, allowing for ordinary demands, which  would have to be met simultaneously.The cost of bricks at the present time was from 30 to 80 per cent, higherthan it was just before the war, but he anticipated that it might bepossible to make a reduction in the near future.    Dr. Addison suggested  that it might be a good plan for theMinistry of  Munitions to control the brickyards.    Sir Siephenson  Kent, remarked that  the  cost of brickmakingdepended  very largely on the class of labour employed.  The higherthe skill the cheaper would  be   the rate at which bricks  could be manufactured.    Mr. Drower stated that the situation was satisfactory as regardsthe supply of ordinary timber for housing and as regards fittings, but he feared a shortage of good joinery  timber and also possibly of paint.    Sir Percy Bates stated that he believed that  sanction had  beengiven for the export  of linseed (which, in the form of oil, was largelyused in the manufacture of  paint) so  that he did not think  that difficulty should arise in the case of paints, although for three to four months there would be  a shortage of white  lead, an essentialingredient of paint for woodwork.    It was decided that     A statement should  be presented to the  Conference as  soon as         possible by the Ministry of  Munitions giving the whole         position  with regard to the materials  available  for  con-         structing and  equipping houses  and making suggestions         as to the steps necessary for  stimulating and maintaining         the supplies.    It was also decided  that     It is inexpedient to  adopt the policy of subsidising private         persons or interests out of State funds.(Initialled),     A.C.G.o
