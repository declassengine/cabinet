(Received 3 p.m.)      Secret.   My telegram of 3rd March.   Afghanistan.  Following from North-West&apos; Frontier, 4th March :       &quot; Following details  received.   On receipt of  messages from Army  in  Kabul, soldiers in Jalalabad attracted by Amanulla&apos;s grant of Rs. 20 a  month, decided, to depose Nasrulla.  They had  prayers read  in  the  name  of  Amir Amanulla on,Friday last  and a salute fired in his honour.  Directly Nasrulla  heard of this  impending mutiny lie assembled leading men and announced his own abdication in favour of Amanulla.  Soldiers demanded immediate  punishment  of murderers  and without orders (? arrested) General Nadir Khan and his family and loaded them with (? chains), They arrested Mustaufi   Mirza  Muhammed  Husain Khan  and the two principal Musahib Sardars Muhammad Ynsuf Khan and Muhammad Asaf Khan who were on the point  of starting for Kabul.   Nasrulla terrified at arrests took refuge in his palace. General Abdur Rahim  Khan and Brigadier Muhammad Anwar Khan are commanding Jalalabad in the interest of Amanulla and have situation well in  hand.  They have arrested about forty sardars and officers and a large escort is expected from Kabul to. take prisoners there.  Three regiments of cavalry and seven infantry from Kabul are expected to arrive at Jalalabad to relieve present garrison.  The coup has been carried out by the army against the wishes of  the Mullahs who were  taken by surprise  and could not organise resistance.  It is believed Inayatulla  is not  bold enough to oppose either his uncle or brother but hopes that they will fight and weaken themselves  and that he may eventually gain  the throne.  Mullahs hope  to  be  able  to raise tribes in favour of  Nasrulla.   Parties  of tribesmen trying  to go to Jalalabad are being turned back by Sarhang (?of)  Dakka.&quot;                        From Viceroy, 1th March 1919.

Following from North-West Frontier, 6th March : &quot; All the Sardar(s) prisoners were sent to Kabul in chains3rd March, and Sardar Nasrulla was sent  in  a motor-car under arrest 3rd March  or4th March.

                         From Viceroy, \iih March 1919.                               (Received 3.45 p.m.)    Secret.   Afghanistan.  Following  letter, dated 3rd  March,  received yesterdayfrom Amir Amanulla (unessentials omitted) : &quot;I wish to inform my friend, with muchdespair and  regret, of a crime lull of poignant grief, &amp;c, &amp;c.  You will doubtless be much touched, for  my fatlier&apos;s strictness of observance of neutrality and  friendly relations were  clearly proved.   I had been  appointed  by him plenipotentiary inKabul and  consider  myself  his  successor and avenger, populace of Kabul aud itssurroundings, religions, military, and  &apos;civil classes, Muhammadans  and  Hindus, aswell as all  foreign subjects  in the capital, enthusiastically  swore allegiance,  andI crowned myself Amir amidst  acclamations of people and troops.  Later on army of Jalalabad proved  their loyalty  by deposing  my  uncle  Nasrulla, who  had asusurper  declared  himself Amir,  thereupon  Nasrulla  abdicated,  and  Imayatulla,more  especially  Hayatulla  and  others  of   the  royal family,  who  had  swornallegiance to him, considered  their allegiance illegal, and  submitted  to me at Kabuland  recognized my succession  as Amir.  Relying on the friendship and sympathythat exist and will continue to exist between us, I have considered  it necessary to domyself great honour  of informing my friend.  Nor let this remain unknown to thatfriend that our independent and  free Government of Afghanistan considers itself ready and  prepared  at  every time and season to conclude,  with due regard  to every consideration for requirements of  friendship  and the  like,  such-agreements&apos; andtreaties with mighty Government of England  as may be useful and serviceable inway of commercial gains and  advantages to our Government and  yours.&quot;    Our proposals regarding  reply will follow.
