The  National  Conference  summoned by  the  Government to consider the present industrial situation was held in the Central Hall, Westminster, on the 27th February.Invitations to send representatives had been issued to Employers&apos; Associations and Federa-tions, Trade Unions and Federations of  Trade Unions. Joint Industrial Councils,  trade boards, and certain other important bodies concerned in the questions dealt with, such asthe Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress, the Parliamentary Committeeof the Scottish Trade Union Congress, the National Alliance of Employers and Employed,&amp;c.  Altogether there appear to have been about 500 workpeople&apos;s and 300 employers&apos;representatives present.    The Minister of Labour took the chair, and opened the discussion with a review of thegeneral situation as regards industrial unrest,  unemployment, hours of labour, minimum wage, and the general attitude of the Government, and in the course of his remarks an-nounced the proposed reduction of the unemployment donation.  The Prime Minister was   (C .1697) 140  3/19  H &amp; S
present during practically the whole of the discussion, but did not speak until near the endof the Conference, when he suggested the combining of two resolutions, previously brought forward by Sir Allan Smith and Mr.  Henderson respectively, into a resolution which was eventually carried, the terms of which were as follows :            &quot; That this conference, being of the opinion that any preventable dislocation of industry is       always to be deplored, and in the present critical period of reconstruction may be disastrous to the       interests of the nation, and thinking that every effort should be made to remove legitimate grievances       and promote harmony and goodwill, resolves to appoint a Joint Committee, consisting of an equal       number of employers and workers, men and women, together with the chairman appointed by the       Government, to consider and report to a further meeting of this conference on the causes of the       present unrest and the steps necessary to&apos; safeguard and promote the interests of employers, work-       people and the State, and especially to consider (1) questions relating to hours, wages and general       conditions of employment; (2) unemployment and its prevention ; and (3) the best method of       promoting co-operation between Capital and Labour.&quot;     The only speaker against the resolution was  Mr.  Bevin, of the Dockers&apos; Union, and representatives of the Triple Alliance formally dissociated that organisation from any partin it, as likely to prejudice negotiations in which its constituents were already concerned,as did Mr. Brownlie for the A.S.E. on the ground that no mandate had been received withregard to it.  In pursuance  of the terms of the  resolution,  the Conference subsequentlydivided  into  two  separate  meetings of employers&apos;  and  workpeople&apos;s  representativesrespectively, for the purpose of appointing  members  of  the proposed Joint  Committee.Details as to further developments will be found in Part  IV of this Report,     The workpeople&apos;s representatives at  the Conference were noticeably  more willing oranxious to speak than  were those of the employers.   Of the latter  only Sir Allan Smith(Engineering  Employers&apos; Federation), Mr.  T. Robinson (Bradford Dyers&apos; Association),Mr.  Smethurst (Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Association), and Mr. Bertram Moss  (NationalFederation of Sawmill Proprietors) spoke ;  while  of the former there were speeches fromMr. J. T. Brownlie (A.S.E.), Mr. Ben Turner (Yorkshire Textile Workers), Mr. C. G. Ammon(London Docks and Wharves Staff Association), Mr. W. J. Davis (Brass Workers), Mr. J. H.Thomas (N.U.R.), Mr. Arthur Henderson (Ironfounders), Mr.  J. R. dynes (National &quot;Unionof General Workers),  Mr. J.  Marston (Police  and Prison Officers&apos;  Association), Miss J.Stevens (National Federation of Women Workers), Mr. Kelly (Workers&apos; Union), and Mr.Bevin (Dockers).  On the whole it seems possible that the Conference may have materiallyimproved the prospects of  industrial peace.  The wide basis  of representation gave an assembly in which the engineers and the Triple Alliance had not their usual predominance,and the tone of the meeting was moderate and  conciliatory from the beginning.  TheConference  was hailed as establishing an important  constitutional precedent,  and theGovernment was again and  again congratulated  in calling industry into counsel in thisway.  The informal procedure,  by which speakers were  allowed to bring up any point,and the Prime Minister deferring his speech until late in the  discussion, was generally welcomed;  no more time was wasted than  would have been the case had there been a formal agenda, and the Minister^ opening remarks from, the chair afforded a good oppor-tunity of publishing the main facts of the industrial situation in their true relation andproportion.     Outstanding features of the discussion were the anxiety of the most important Labourspokesmen to help in  finding a way out  of the present unrest, and the desire shown by employers to settle &apos;their relations with labour for  themselves, if possible, without Covc-rn-ment intervention. For this reason the resolution,  brought forward, independently bySir Allan Smith and Mr. Henderson, to set up a joint committee to report on the causes ofthe present unrest and the chief claims of Labour, was received by the great majority ofthe Conference as providing a practical outcome of the day&apos;s discussion.  If the same spiritof helpfulness characterises the discussions of the joint committee, there would  appear tobe a possibility of a unanimous pronouncement that will relieve the Government of someof its present responsibilities in the field  of industrial relations and strengthen its hands inthe discharge of those it retains.  Mr. Thomas and Mr. Clynes both condemned emphati-cally the unofficial strikes that have been so frequent recently, and insisted on the need ofindustrial peace.  Their speeches  were well  received.     While expressing their anxiety to assist with any immediate step to improve industrial relations, the Labour spokesmen affirmed, very definitely the Labour demand  for betterconditions and a higher status than they enjoyed before the war.   Some disappointmentand apprehension were expressed at the Governments announcement of a reduced Unem-ployment Donation.  The  references to &quot; profiteering &quot; were cheered,  and there were signs that it is not merely their employees profits that the workpeople resent, but the generalinequality of wealth apparent at the present time.  In the main, however, discussion was directed  to objects that might be attained by negotiation with employers, and to thefacilitating of such negotiations.
                      PART II-DEMOBILISATION AND RESETTLEMENT.The Resettlement of Officers.    Up to the 27th February, 51,000 officers had been demobilised from the thiee Forces.The  immediate  problems presented by  this demobilisation, however, have been,  veiyconsiderably diminished,  by the recent instructions for the composition of the Aimies ofOccupation.  The restrictions imposed on demobilisation are much more stringent in thecase  of officers than of men.  The only classes of officers immediately releasable from theArmy, apart from those recommended by the Ministry of Labour before the 1st February,1919, for release as civil demobilisers, as pivotal men or on special  grounds, are those over51 years of age or those entitled to wear three or more wound stripes.*  In the case of theAir Force,  all officers are liable to be retained until military or naval exigencies peimitof their release, unless they  have been certified as demobilisers,  as pivotal  men or asentitled to release on  special grounds.&quot;)&quot;  Preference in release will in future  be givento officers over 37 years  of age, or to those who enlisted, before the 1st January, 1916.    In the special task of obtaining the release of pivotal men, there has been considerable delay.  As regards the registration of offers of employment for officers under the &quot; slip &quot;system the work is believed to be about half complete.   Even after four months, applica-tions are still coming in at a rapid rate.  These officers,  when available for demobilisation,will return either to their pre-war employment or to positions guaranteed, under the usualconditions  of demobilisation.  The complelion of  this process of returning  to civil lifemen who in most cases are already trained, and experienced, in its duties still leaves  openmore difficult problems the prevention of wastage among the untrained and. inexperienced,and the discovery of scope for those who have found new powers during the war.    The greatest difficulty which,  is experienced at present in dealing with these problems,which are to some extent akin, lies in the difference between what the Army has had tooffer  the young  officer  untrained for civil life and what the economic world is inclined tooffer  to an imperfectly trained man.  The lowest  rate of pay which an officer  has  beendrawing may be stated as at least  300 taking into account his service gratuity.  Fiftyper cent, of the  vacancies notified by employers to the Appointments Department carry with  them salaries of  200 or less.   Under these circumstances it is not surprising  that much difficulty  is found  in inducing men to accept these lower rates of pay.   While theyoung officer doubtless is in many cases expecting too much, the employer in many  cases is clearly averse  to taking risks.   *  Provision is made, however, for release in extreme compassionate cases approved by the Army Council,and for officers from overseas enlisted in the British. Forces and approved by the  Army audiorities for release.   f  Provision is also made for compassionate cases.    One point that the critics of the Conference made was felt to be important, the objec-tion, namely, that the Conference was not formally representative of Labour and Employers&apos;Organisations.  That there were advantages in thus providing the less vocal and aggressiveindustries with an  opportunity to voice their opinions is not in doubt;  but for this reason the Conference cannot be considered as in any way binding Labour.  The speech of Mr.Bevin, opposing the setting up of a joint committee, probably represented an importantminority of opinion in industry, and the distrust of both employers and the State that itindicates must be  allowed for.   It  is  to be noted, further, that the workpeople&apos;s repre-sentatives appointed to  the joint  committee include no representatives of  the Mining,Railway, and Transport Industries, or of the Woollen Trade.  The report of the committee,therefore, will depend,  for its authority entirely on  the intrinsic merit of its proposals,and the personal weight of its signatories.    The outcome of the Conference maybe regarded as  a renewed, hope in the possibilityof industrial peace, and. a semi-representative commission on industrial unrest, with termsof reference wide enough  to include the whole of the Government&apos;&amp; or  the Labour Party&apos;s social programme.  The adjourned  meeting of the conference, when the  committee&apos;sreport is presented, will afford the critics of the Government a very favourable opportunityof raising any point in the Governments domestic policy that they dislike,  and for thisreason that occasion may be expected to form, a valuable opportunity for the  Governmentto explain any details that may he obscure in, and clear up any misunderstandings arisingout of, its social and industrial programme.
    Experience, therefore,  continues to impress the lesson of the necessity  of training.It is noteworthy that the problem of finding employment has proved most easy of solution in the case of officers still in the Forces who have been trained during convalescence underthe Officers&apos; University and Technical  Classes scheme.  In no case where an officer hasbeen so trained has there been found any difficulty in obtaining a suitable appointment for him.  Decisions have been taken as regards the  demobilisation of convalescent  officersin training, which limit the scope of the scheme in  so far  as officers other than regularsare concerned.   Of the 3,000 officers, however, at present  in training under the Officers&apos;University and  Technical Classes scheme, by far the greater number are claiming con-sideration under the Government scheme for State  assistance, in order to complete their training rather than to enter at once into the field  of employment,    The usual  avenues for academic and professional instruction are already becomingcongested, and there is no immediate prospect of any great  improvement in this direction.The centres of higher and technical education have been seriously hampered during thewar, and cannot hope to deal at once with the arrears of work entailed by four years ofwar, at  a time when their normal activities are reviving.    A wider and more elastic field is, however, being explored.  Training in professional and commercial occupations can be given by private firms or employers who are willingto provide vacancies for that purpose.  At the present time, every large firm in the countryis being approached  on this  matter by the Appointments Department, and the profes-sional societies  are being asked to co-operate.  The results are progressively encouraging-ing, despite difficulties in the way.  A  large proportion of potential  training firms are ready to fall in  with the scheme, but there is still  considerable reluctance to guaranteeactual training  vacancies until industry revives.  The system, moreover, is one requiringcareful supervision ;  not every training vacancy which is offered can  be accepted.  Thecharacter of the opportunities offered shows, however, a continuous improvement, and thesystem when fully developed  should bring to the aid of  the  training  authorities  theassistance of large numbers of business and professional men both at home and abroad.                          PART III. PRESS COMMENTS.                           (1) Labour and Socialist Pvcss.                              (A) Peace Conference.League of Nations.    The draft scheme is again subjected to severe criticism.   It is strongly condemnedby Mr. Ramsay Macdonald in &quot; Forward &quot; and in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; by whom it isregarded as a challenge to democracy.  The control of the world is to pass into the handsof an armed bureaucracy endowed with absolute political and economic power of punish-ment and suppression.   He adds that there is yet time,  however,  for the I.L.P. and theInternationale to do something to  secure amendments which  will give  the scheme sometouch of democracy.  Mr. Philip Snowden in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; believes that sucha League will divide the world into two antagonistic groups based on hate and fear. The&quot; British Citizen &quot; reviewing the League from a different aspect, finds that its chief  failing-is the lack of.force  behind it,  The &quot; Herald &quot; alone makes some  attempt to defend thescheme.  Although  the  draft is fully deserving of criticism, it thinks  that to have got the delegates of so many different powers to sign any document that may possibly stopwar is already an enormous  step in advance of anything that has ever  been done  beforein the history of the world.   Again, the paper believes that President Wilson is fightingsingle-handed against the Imperialists of France and Italy and some of our own statesmen,especially Mr. Hughes, and it is impossible for one man or one nation  alone to improve the constitution of the League,The Armistice Terms.     The &quot; Herald &quot; alleges that Germany is quite willing to have the size of her  armiesand  armaments controlled by  a League of Nations and asks why all other nations  do notdeclare their willingness to do the same.   The &quot; Labour Leader &quot;  asserts that the policyof the Allies in imposing such cruel armistice terms is playing into the hands of the Junkerson one side  and  of the Spartacists on the other.  No German Government which acceptssuch humiliating  terms  can expect to retain popular  support.
  The Attempt on M. Clemencecm.      In the &quot; Herald,&quot; the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; &quot; Forward,&quot; &quot; &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; and  the &quot; Call &quot; the attempt on M. Clemenceau&apos;s life is regretted, because such acts invariably  help to strengthen  the position and therefore reinforce the policy of their victims, and  in France this  attempted assassination is said  to have  been followed by the  most  abominable war against French  socialists and especially against M. Longuet.  None of  the papers except the &quot; British Citizen&quot; believe that the crime was engineered by any  political body.   In the words of the &quot; Call&quot; the press is trying to foist the guilt on to the  Bolsheviks, but  Kurt Eisner&apos;s  fate proves  how  groundless  is  the  suggestion  that  assassination must  he the work  of sympathisers  with Bolshevism.  The &quot; Workers&apos;  Dreadnought&quot;  does not  think that M.  Clemenceau&apos;s death would have  been any gain  to Socialism since he was only the figurehead of the bourgeoise  and his death would not  have affected the strength of that party.  In conclusion, the paper does not believe that  there is any danger of the left-wing movement in  this country inclining towards  such  methods of terrorism.  It thinks that the Wheeldon case, for example, was purely a &quot; fake.&quot;                                (B) Foreign Affairs.  Russia.     The  &quot; Herald &quot; continues to  ask for an  explanation of our Russian policy.   Lord Curzon, on.one occasion, is said to have referred to &quot;the engagements  into which we have entered&quot;   with  various  anti-Bolshevik Governments.  The  &quot; Herald&quot; demands to know what these &quot; engagements &quot; are which have been concealed from the people of this country.  The &quot; Call &quot;  urges the Labour Party to force the Government to withdraw troops  from Russia.     The  &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; publishes a long letter from Lenin to the workers of Petrograd, reprinted from the Soviet organ the &quot; Isvestia.&quot;   The &quot; Cause of Famine &quot; Lenin alleges to be the profiteering in grain by the peasants and bourgeois who are  thus continually violating the State monopoly of  bread, established for the purpose of effective distribution.  At a time when the nation is starving it becomes criminal to conceal a single &quot; pood &quot; of food or fuel.  Therefore Lenin appeals for a mass crusade to be started to help the local Soviets at the  most important transport junctions in their efforts to establish a system of accounting and control and to destroy by force of arms if necessary - all speculation bribery and corruption.                                 (C) Home  Affairs. The Miners&apos; Demand.     This subject occupies most of the space in the Labour papers.  Their general attitude may  be summed up in the words of the &quot; Herald.&quot;  The Prime Minister has produced three weapons against coal miners i (1) The Guards are called home from Germany; (2) at the same  time Mr. Lloyd George seeks to inflame public  opinion against  the miners by making statements taken from a coal owner&apos;s brief  to show that the acceptance  of the miners&apos; programme would ruin the  country.  He  does  not  produce any facts to prove the accuracy of  his figures;  (3) the Prime  Minister  has appointed another Royal Corn- mission on Coal.   If he really believes an inquiry is  necessary why did he anticipate its findings by telling the country that  the miners&apos;  programme would ruin it ?  Concerning the first point the &quot; Workers&apos;  Dreadnought&quot; also notes with some suspicion that the Guards have just been called home.    Referring to the Prime Ministers speech the &quot; Call&quot; sees no reason  to believe the accuracy of his figures; while &quot; Justice,&quot; &quot; Call,&quot;  and the &quot; Herald &quot; all  emphasise the fact that Mr. Lloyd George, in prophesying  ruin through foreign competition, concealed the information that wages both in Germany and America have been rising more rapidly than  here.  The  &quot; Labour  Leader &quot; an\d the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; think that the object of the Government in setting up an Inquiry is to obtain a report which will endorse Mr. Lloyd  George&apos;s speech.   In the  opinion of the &quot; Call&quot;  the  Government appears to aim at turning the mass of public opinion against the miners.    To &quot; Forward &quot;  alone  does the Government offer of an Inquiry seem reasonable. Serious  obstacles, however,  are the lack of confidence in  the Government and fear of the hostile influences within and behind it; The &quot; Call &quot;  maintains that there is a margin of&apos; profits from which the increased costs due to the miners&apos; demands can be drawn.   For, on the very day of the Prime Ministers speech, Government figures were published showingthe enormous incomes derived from mining concerns  and assessable for income tax.
Press Propaganda.    Referring to the Government use of the press for propaganda, the &quot; Labour Leader &quot;suggests that the press is apparently to be used at public expense to arouse resentmentagainst any section of the workers who are seeking an improvement in their conditions.Some Labour member should ask the Government for an account of the sum being spent in this way.  The  &quot;British  Citizen&quot;  is  the only paper which blames  the miners forthreatening to strike.   It states that the National Democratic Party delivered, to  each individual  member  in every coalfield their manifesto urging the miners to desist fromstriking.Unemployed Women.    The  &quot; Herald &quot; remarks that no provision seems to have been made for the futureof the women whose Unemployment Benefits will shortly come to an end. Mr. Parker,for the Labour  Ministry, acknowledged  in  the  House the misatisfactory conditions prevailing in domestic service, but apparently the Labour Ministry is compelling women to accept situations which, they thus admit to be unsatisfactory by the threat of withdrawingtheir  Unemployment Benefits.               (2) The Daily Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.    Little reference is made this week to the subject of demobilisation in  the daily press.    The &quot; Manchester Guardian &quot; (26th February) reports that a meeting of several hun-dred demobilised and discharged soldiers, held in Manchester on the 25th February,  passedresolutions calling on  the Government  to take action to relieve the  prevailing distress.It was stated that  the demobilised man  was being exploited, by both the Governmentand the employer.   Should constitutional means fail to secure redress, they were preparedto take extreme action.    The  &quot; Daily  Telegraph &quot; (1st  March) states that up to the 27th February  44,238officers and 1,713,803  other ranks had been discharged or demobilised from the Army.    The police authorities, according to the &quot; Daily Express &quot; of the  28th February, are greatly handicapped in dealing with the outbreak of crime in London, as a considerablenumber of the force are still serving with the colours.    The &quot; National News &quot; of the 2nd March draws attention to the slow release of medicalmen.   &quot; Of the 12,000 doctors in the Army, little more than 2,000 have been demobilised,and the number  includes practitioners from  overseas.  This is a real  scandal.  It is theArmy Medical Department which is at fault.&quot;                PART IV. GENERAL TOPICS AND DISTRICT REPORTS.                                   (A\ General.National Conference.    The National Industrial Conference is referred to  in Part I.  The first meeting of theJoint Committee  set up by the Conference was held  on Tuesday, the 4th March.  ThePrime Minister was present  for a considerable time.    Sir Thomas Munro presided over the proceedings, which were private.    Three sub-committees were appointed to deal with the following sections :     (1)  Wages and hours, and the general conditions  of trade.    (2)  Unemployment and its prevention.    (3)  The best methods of promoting co-operation between Capital and Labour.Workers&apos; Demands.    Miners.-At the miners Conference on the 27th February it was unanimously agreedto postpone the strike notices from the 15th March to the 22nd March, and to take part inthe Coal Mines Commission, at which half the representatives are to be miners.   It wasalso decided to ask the Parliamentary Committee of  the  Trade Union Congress  and theLabour Party to take up the question of unemployed demobilised men, or those  who areunable to follow their previous employment.  The first meeting of the Coal Mines Commis-sion was held on the 3rd March.    Railway  Clerks Association  At  a conference of  the  Railway  Clerks Associationheld at Birmingham on the 1st and 2nd March, great dissatisfaction was expressed that thequestion of recognition of the Union had  been under discussion for three weeks withoutany conclusion being  reached, and  also that the recognition agreement would  only be
 binding on the Railway Executive Committee, and not to individual railway companies, who still refused to grant full recognition to any Trade Union   A resolution was passed instructing the Executive Committee of the Railway Clerks Association to suspend negotia- tions with the Railway Executive Committee, and to refer the whole matter back to Sir A. Stanley, with the request for a definite settlement by the 11th March.  This was inter- preted by the Conference to mean a general railway strike after that date unless a satis- factory answer is received.     Police. There appears to be renewed discontent among the members of the Metropolitan Police Force, who consider that the Chief Commissioner is attempting to evade the arrange- ments which conduced to a settlement of the late strike.  Recently, on  the  question of certain overtime pay,  the Chief Commissioner  refused to deal with Executive Committee elected by the men, according to the agreement arrived at, but gave  his answer direct to the Secretary of the Police Union.   In so acting against the agreement arrived at with the men&apos;s  representatives, the Chief Commissioner again raises the  problem  of whether the police  are to be allowed the full rights of Trade Unionism, or to be under  a  semi-military form of discipline.     Transport Workers. The meeting between the representatives of the Municipal Tram- ways Association, the Tramways and Light Railways Association, and  the National Trans- port Workers Federation, held at B irmingham on the 28th February, did  not remove the deadlock reached at the previous London negotiations, due to the men&apos;s demand that wages should remain unaltered with the reduction of hours to 48.     A sub-committee was appointed to make  further inquiries in view  of the Conference being resumed at Manchester next week. International Seafarers&apos; Conference.     At a further meeting of the International Seafarers&apos; Conference on the 27th February, it was resolved (1)  that, the further extension  of the principle of the  American Seamen&apos;s Act  should be left to the discretion of the seamen of each separate country  ; (2) that an international minimum wage of  15 per month for sailors and firemen, with  other ratings in proportion thereto, should be the minimum wage in all  nations  represented at the Conference. Joint Industrial Councils.     Government  Industrial  Establishments.- A  preliminary Conference of  representatives of Trade Unions having members employed in Government Industrial Establishments, and  officials of the Government Departments concerned, was held on  the 20th February. The  Conference accepted the proposal for the formation of a Whitley Council in Govern- ment Departments, and also recommended the establishment of a Standing Arbitration Council, to be referred  to in cases where the Treasury or the employing departments were not prepared to adopt a recommendation of a Joint Council.  The trades  to be repre- sented include Engineering, Shipbuilding,  Building, and General Labour. Baking.  &apos;   The Food Controller has refused to comply with the Master Bakers&apos;  request for an increase in the price of the loaf, as their case was not found to be a convincing one.   The weakness of the Master Bakers&apos; case is, indeed, admitted in their own Journal.  It appears that the Master Bakers&apos; Associations have  made the Food Controllers decision an excuse to withdraw from-the Baking Industrial Council, so that they will not consider themselves bound  by any agreement concerning night-work  reached by the Council.   On the 5th March the Master Bakers decided to suspend their  threat of reverting to the sale  of bread less than 12 hours old.                             (B) District Reports. London and South-Eastern.    Employment. Unemployment   among men exists  mainly  in  the  building   and engineering  trades.  Among women  the  unemployed  are largely  ex-factory  hands. Outside  London unemployment is  not  serious, except  in  isolated localities, such as Ipswich, where rug-making has been started to absorb unemployed women.    Bousing. Housing congestion is acute, and it is suggested from Chelmsford that armyhutments might be usefully adapted.
 South-Western.     Hours  of Labour. The labour situation is reported as being very favourable.  All parties are becoming reconciled to the  shorter working week, although some difficulty has occurred at the works of Messrs. S. E. Saunders (Cowes,  I. of W.). West Midlands.     Employment. Engineering discharges are  believed to  have reached their limit  and the absorption of the unemployed will begin as soon as tools are ready.   The fact that moulders   and patternmakers  are debarred  by their Unions  from working  overtime retards the employment of other grades of labour.     Chain-making  and  Hollow Ware.-In  Dudley the shortage of wrought iron (which depends on the release of puddlers from the Army and the  transport of black plates from Wales) is holding up chain-making and hollow ware manufacturing.  The Board of Trade has been asked to consider an embargo on the export of black plates.     Dilutees. The Birmingham Committee of the A.S.E. has drawn attention  to  two firms which are alleged to he evading the  Treasury Agreement as to the employment of dilutees ;  action is being taken. Yorkshire and East Midlands.     Engineers  and a National Programme. There is very little  indication of  serious unrest in this district.  At the Conference of Engineering and Allied Trades Joint Com- mittees at Leeds, on the 22nd February, a  committee of five was instructed to frame an Engineers&apos; Charter for a shorter working week ;  the abolition of unemployment, overtime, payment by results, and dilution ; the restoration of trade union  rights ;  the control of working conditions;  and the conversion of war wages and the 12^ per cent, bonus  into normal wages,  with minimum rates.  It is suggested that  these proposals  may cause an acute dispute about the month of  May. North-Wester n.     The Industrial Conference.-Disappointment is expressed at the refusal  of representa- tion to the rank and file movement in the National Industrial Conference.     Employment. Particularly in Accrington, Burnley and Blackburn, difficulties in the textile industry are causing unemployment. In Barrow large numbers  of women  are out of work, and  the  Local Advisory Committee has asked for State aid in creating  new industries for the area.     Agricultural  Wages (Cheshire). Agricultural labourers in Cheshire have  taken a ballot on the proposed wage rate of 50s. for a 50-hour week.  Out of a poll of 4,194, the proposal secured a majority of  3,560 ; a conference of 70 delegates is to meet at&apos; Chester.     Electricians [Manchester). Electricians in Manchester  are taking a ballot vote with a view to supporting the transformer men who are on strike for recognition of their work as skilled.     Rice and Flour Mills (Liverpool). Unrest is evident at Liverpool in,the three  rice mills of the city, whose rates are low  compared with those in the  flour milling industry.Unrest is also affecting the flour mills, where rates have been reduced  owing  to an altera- tion of hours. Northern.     Employment. Unemployment is mainly  in  shipbuilding,  engineering  and iron- founding industries.   The Newcastle Tramway Company have now given notice to their female employees to make room for returned soldiers.  Attempts  to divert unemployed women into domestic service are not very successful.     Mining Crisis. As in South Wales, the opinion is expressed that, if the Coal Coin- mission report be unfavourable, the miners&apos; leaders will be in a difficult position.   The rank and file are convinced that their claim for  a  6-hour  day is sound and reasonable. A substantial increase in wages is also expected, and  the  question of  nationalisation is being followed  with intense interest.   The Triple Alliance  gives the miners  confidence, and there is a suspicion that colliery managements have kept off working the best seams in order to reduce output and increase cost  for ulterior motives.     Food. Food distribution is criticised.  Shopkeepers who expect a  reduction  of food prices  are apparently carrying on with low stocks, roughly  about a week&apos;s supply. This would create a dangerous situation if  a  breakdown of transport occurred.   The  quality of the meat supply continues unsatisfactory, and  the scarcity of whisky was  felt  during the influenza epidemic.
 Wales,     UnresL-Tha decision of the Miners&apos; Conference, on Thursday, the 27th February, to postpone strike notices has been received with satisfaction, but it is considered doubtful whether the findings of the commission, unless they concede all the demands of the men, will avert trouble.  Active propaganda is being carried on in the mining valleys by the Independent Labour Party and  the  Central  Labour College classes.   Discontent is also apparent among the farm labourers of the area, who threaten drastic action in spring or autumn.     Coal Commission,-It is hoped that the investigations of the Coal Commission will extend to such questions as the effect of mining royalties on the development of the coal areas, the relations between the coal owners and the Cardiff Railway Company, the provision of working men&apos;s trains, the system of  penalties for illegal stoppages, and the custom of leaving work when a fatal accident occurs.&apos;     Spelter and Tin.-In the spelter industry  American competition is feared and a pre- emption on imported Australian ore is hoped for.  In the tin plate industry the shortage of furnacemen, doublers, and behinders  is acute.     Iron and Steel. Iron and steel workers governed by the South Wales and Moiimouth- shire sliding scale, are dissatisfied with a recent arbitration award, on their application for an increase of Is. Qd. per man and 9d. per boy.  The Ebbw Yale workers in particular claim  an all  round increase of 30 per  cent, on all earnings, and would refer the points at issue to  the Ministry of Labour.  Feeling is running rather high.   Owing to lack of material, Messrs. Baldwin&apos;s new steel  works may have to close down, and the Port Talbot steel works are also slack from the same cause.     Dock Labour. Transport questions are prominent.  Demands have been forwarded by the National  Transport Workers Federation and the National Union of Raihvaymen on behalf of trimmers and tippers  at the coal ports ;   these workers  are pressing  for a definition of  working hours and shifts, and for  advances in wages.     Transport Workers.-At Cardiff (27th February, 1919), the South Wales Committee of  the National Transport  Workers  Federation elected a Central  Strike Committee to prepare for action, failing the acceptance of  the national programme.     Chinese Sailors. Protests  against  the  employment of Chinese  on  British  ships continue ; including coloured men, 1,400 labourers of  British nationality are waiting for employment in Cardiff alone. Scotland.     Lull  in  Unrest. The  labour position in  Scotland is relatively tranquil; action is evidently being delayed until the  claims of the Triple Alliance have  been considered. A sedative effect is also  attributed to the  meeting of the Industrial Conference.  The position of employees prominent in the  recent  strike who are being refused reinstatement or are being  reinstated only under conditions is arousing some criticism from the trade unions;  but the  appeal of the Clyde  Propaganda Defence Committee for funds to secure legal advice for the arrested leaders is not meeting with much success.     Employment. Unemployment  continues  to  be the main source  of  unrest.   It is reported that building schemes are being held up owing to fears of excessive rating. In such centres as Falkirk, Clydebank and Dumbarton, schemes are being launched to absorb unemployed  women.  The  Dumbarton and  Alexandria  Women&apos;s Sub-Committee  is co-operating  with the principal of the continuation classes to provide a three months&apos; training  course in  domestic  science.    At Clydebank, Messrs. Singers  are  expected to employ the surplus female labour as soon as they have properly embarked on their peace- time work.    Joint Industrial Councils. While the craft unions in the West  of Scotland  show some reluctance to adopt the principles of the  Whitley Report,  a  strong  movement towards organisation with a view to joint action appears in the less organised trades. Ireland.    Linen. The  shortage of  orders in the linen trade  has compelled a general adoptionof a 35-hour week.
     Dockers  (Belfast). At a conference between the  Employers&apos; Association and  the belfast dockers who are members of  the Irish Transport and General  Workers&apos; Union,questions of wage-rates, hours and overtime,  and  the abolition of tonnage  work were discussed.   The  employers&apos; offers having been refused, efforts are being made to  induce the  union to agree to joint reference to the Ministry  of Labour.                                  PART V. DISPUTES.                           (A) Involving a Stoppage of Work.Reported from Various Sources.            A general resumption of work is taking place on the North-East Coast where the boiler-        makers, blacksmiths and shipwrights have been on strike since the 6th January on the question        of pieceworkers&apos;  wages under the 47-hour week  agreement.  On the  3rd March work was        resumed  in the NeAvcastle, Wallsend and  the  Beverley and  Hessle districts.  Negotiations        on the matters in dispute will be opened during the week between the employers and Trade        Unions concerned.            The  strike of  engineers at Messrs. Crossley&apos;s, Gorton, which began on the 12th February,        ended on the 3rd March.            The  Thames ship-repairers have resumed work on condition that no victimisation  takes        place.  The employers&apos; offer of. arbitration is being considered by the committee of the  allied        engineering trades.            A strike  occurred at Messrs. Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds, Dowlais, on the  3rd March, in-        volving about 4,000 colliers ;  among other grievances, the men are demanding  recognition        for coal washery men as members of the South Wales Miners Federation.&apos;            No settlement is reported of the strike of ship-repairers on the Bristol Channel, who ceased        work on the 23rd January  in support of a demand for increased wages.            As reported last week, the strike of electricians at Cardiff ended on the 24th February.        It has been decided  to refer the men&apos;s claims to the Electrical Trades Industrial Council.                           (B) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.Reported from Various  Sources.            In addition to the threatened national strike of coal miners which  has been postponed        until  the 22nd March and that of the Cheshire  farm labourers, mentioned last week, there        is the possibility of  a strike on the railways on the -11th March owing to  the action taken by        the Railway Clerks Association, which is referred to in Part IV (A).            The electricians in Manchester are taking a ballot vote  on the question of  supporting the        strike of transformer men, about 300 of whom are on strike in support  of their claim  to be        paid at skilled nien&apos;s rates.R.
