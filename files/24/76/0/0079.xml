It is noticeable that tho chief leaders of til    movement In-Germany are either foreisners, l,e,    Russian, or, if German, then foreign to that part!    of Germany in which they are carrying on their    activities.   Thoy fall into two classes, the    adventurers and the idealists.   The adventurers    are of course a well-known phenomenon in all    revolutionary crises and at the present time are    to operate with particular success owing to the    extraordinary spread of moral obliquity and corrul    tion in Germany during the four years of war.    They are in close communication with Russia whencl    they derive onormous sums of money for the &quot;Causal    The strength of their position is due to the factl    that they have nothing to lose and everything  to    Toy a continuance of anarchy.       The idealists come from the &quot;modern&quot; intellect)    and artistic classes and are much more dangerous    the adventurers-.

The nature of their aims and the manner of their ol       The great strength of the Sjmrtacist leaderslies In the fact that theirs is the only party inGermany which has any definite political programme.They both preach and also themselves believe thatcommunism is the political state which alone can bring happiness to the world.    On the whole the level of oratory at suchSpartacist meetings as I attended is higher than one                   would expect.   The general line of argument is more                   or less ae follows:- &quot;Our  ictefl! is the oanmunistic                   state and perfect equality for all,   Germany  isMoabit, Weicsensee starving and Impoverished;  betrayed and deceivedand neighbourhood  by her former leaders as no country has ever been of Schlesischer    before (this observation is always applauded to theBahnhof,           echo), she has not only been thoroughly beaten but ho
earned tho hatred and contempt of the reat of Europe.The present government is no better than tho lost.Their political tyranny is the same - witness the murder of Liobkneoht and Rosa Luxemburg0  -  Tnoy enjoyneither the confidence nor tho respect cf the people,They aro christened &quot;das Affonthoater in V/&quot;lm j,r110Further, they do not enjoy the confidence of theEntente.   Look at the way Erzborger is treatedland he gets no more than he deserves   If tho Ententetrusted tho Government they would gond food into thecountry;  and would start, peaco negotiations.   Tiieydo not do so because they know the Government will not last.   What uso is a&apos;Government that cannot give thepooplo food or issues?   The &quot;majority&quot; socialists havebetrayed tho revolution and arc merely aidingcapitalism to forge new chains for the enslavement  -of tho proletariat.     This Governmont theroforo must go.     Next,, all military action against the Bolchevikarmy must cease,  Russian Bolchevism is painted bytho capitalist in livid colours.   In truth it isbringing a Paradise on earth,   All reports to thocontrary are inventions of tho Government, a merecontinuation of tho policy of lies and deceit thatwas carried on during the war,   The terrorism in &apos;Russia was caused not by the Bolsheviks but by theGorman troops sent therw by tin? German Government.     Vihen the Russians come, we will open our ft.rmcand receive them like brothers, who arc to free us from the tyranny of our rulers,   Then-the world-revolution will be inevitable,   All-Europe will beaflame, tho old capitalist world will&apos; bo swept away and communism and peace will be established&quot;,     In private conversation some of thCco &quot;intellect-actuals&quot; admit that much that Is valuable and bo&amp;utlfulwill be destroyed and thero will be a period ofsuffering and bloodshed.   But at tho ciamo time they say, the chains of commerce?, the ties of treaties and agreements, ell national burdens anddebts will be swopt away and Europe will startafresh ence more,   Only the land.will remain, men with muscles to work and create, fields, houses,railways and somo machinery.  Then Gorman industryand application will reap their reward, and aninternational proletariat in which Germany will play a loading part, will guarantee universal peace.     Tho extent to which this kind of argument meetswith success amens the lowor classes in Germany isin direct and immediate dependence on the conditionscf feed and labour prevailing at the time.     It is universally contended by all members ofthe middle and upper classes that the Bolchovistdanger can only be met if food in considerable quantities Is introduccnl into tho Country.S*ureo:1, Conversationsirith members  cfaudience  afterabove meetings.2, Graf Zooh.

Statements of this kind would in themselves be insufficient proof and might be attributed to a mot d&apos;ordre. But it is clear that the Spartacists themselves are counting upon this factor. The chairman of a secret spartacist meeting hold on 18.2.? in Meabit-Berlin said "The corn supplies of the country will not last beyond the middle of March. If no more food is brought in before then, we&apos;ll have the whole of the masses behind us."

Further I have myself talked with workmen and unemployed in the cafes and "Keller" of the poor and listened to their conversations. In nine cases cut of ten they say "we are not Spartacists but if we don&apos;t get food very soon we&apos;ll smash everything up, plunder the rich, plunder the farmers, join the Russians and plunder Europe".

The part of the programme which invloves joining the Russians exercises a remarkable fascination on the mind of the Berlin population. In fact the danger is not as remote as might appear. The German forces on the East front are not increasing: desorters to the Bolchoviks are as frequent as recruits from Germany. Bad weather has lately caused the advance to be less rapid but as soon as spring sets in and the Bolcheviks begin to need further food supplies, their army (which the German General Staff estimates at 400,000 to 500,000 men) will start to advance and there is very little prospect that the Germans will be able to prevent it.

Though the internal discipline of the Bolchevik army is of unparallolled rigour, their battle discipline is of no account and propably 50,000 "immune" troops would be sufficient to rout them. But there is not a single German regiment which may be regarded as "immune" from this dangerous disease, so long as Germany itself is in the present condition of Spartacist formont.

The Spartacist programme may sound ridiculous but it indubitably appeals to the popular German mind?

There are a few who realise that their situation would not be improved by this process. But that vast majority, are beyond logic or argument and have reached a condition of desperation the danger of which cannot possibly, I think, be exaggerated. They have waited for food from the West and so far waited in vain. They new turn to the East and look to the coming of the Bolchevik army as though Lenin were a Messiah. The lower classes in Germany are not interested in Communism or any other kind of political theary for its own sake. Any kind of political crator who promised food would be listened to with equal roadiness. Those for instances who in public meetings threaten the Entonto with a Bolche? Germany if food is not sent meet with equal applaus. The ordinary German is interested not in Belchevism but in food and it is only because the two are united in his mind that he listens to the dectrinos of the revolitionary.

It  is  stated by tho  authorities  that  tho  corn    supply will last till the middle  of March - even if    there should be  enough for a  few  more weeks on the    basis of the present ration,  the  danger  of the    situation Is none the less imminent.   On the present    rations, the people are now underfed.  Illicit    trading  has thriven even  more since the  revolution    than before and  the poor  aro  justly enraged, against    the rich who, particularly in the large  hotels, can    get almost  anything&apos;they  like.            !         The masses  are like  people wtndoring  about in a    thick fog and unable to find  their way out.    Prolonged undernourishment has produced  a  condition    of nervous  irritability and an Incapacity  to under-    &quot;take any organised action. In their  aimless groping    for the  path of  escape they constantly bump against    their neighbours and trample  on their feet. Their    temper is becoming more and more  dangerous and If    some ray of light does not very soon   COLK to  pierce    the gloom,  it is absolutely oertain that in the    shortest possible time complete and universal    anarchy  will break out, every industrial centre will    be destroyed, the rich will bo robbed of everything    they possess and the state of the country  will be it    least as bad as  that of Russia.&apos;         It  must bo  repeated  that  this view  is not based    merely on the -observations and prophecies  of the    governmental and commercial classes.   The  crowded    audiences and Spartacist  meetings and the  tension    and excitement prevailing are a convincing proof,    still further confirmed by the secret reports  of    official and private services&apos;.iii.The Spartacist organisation appears  to bo  centred in   &apos; Berlin,   They have branch organisations  inmost of&apos;    tho industrial towns throughout Germany, and also in    tho various districts of  Berlin-Itself.  Secret    \    meetings are constantly held  (there  Is one almost    every day in some part of Berlin) at  which reports   . aro handed in by &quot;agitators&quot;  of this number of    people they have boon able to win over to  the  Case.    Those men direct their activity particularly towards    tho troops of the Berlin  Garrison. According  to tho    most recent reports practically all  the  Republikanische    Sold-tonwohr (about 1,300 men) had como  over and about    1/3 of the Frelkorpo Lilttwltz (about  30,000).         Plans are then discussed for the continuance    and development  of propaganda.  At one such secret    mooting  it was decided to send a  &quot;few hundred un-    employed to Erfurt and Halle  to cause disturbances,    and to pay thorn 25-30 marks a day&quot;.         In fact the Spartacist leaders  appear to have    control  of enormous sums  of money which are stated    to bo Imported into Germany via Holland and, to a    less extent, via England  and Switzerland,         Very active propaganda is also  carried on by tho    Sp^rtacist newspapers, Rote: Bxihne, Republik, Aktion    and even tho Proiholt,  An .agent  reports a socret    meeting  of the Spartacists in tho offices  of this last    paper (which is  really the organ of  the  &quot;Independent    party),   Plans wore discussed for the co-operation of    the Bpartacists  and &quot;independents&quot; in the  organisation    of a large demonstration of unemployed.
     Besides these newspapers great activity isdisplayed in the direction of pamphlets and brnnhuretkof all kinds.Source:Personal obser-vation in cafes,meetings, etc.Source:A director ofDeutsohesTheater andyassim.Source:Anti-Bolshevik6.S,Source:Personalobservationof the events.     Finally press agents are sent out from newspapercentres to work among the poorer classes, particularly!the unemployed.  I can testify from personalobservation as to the efficacy of thoir propaganda,They find their victims in a state of peculiarreceptivity for the&apos; germ they wish to inoculate.Hungry men are unwilling to work but extremely proneto Insurrection.  The masses in Berlin at presentdo nothing but talk.  They Root, talk, disperse andmeet and talk again all day long.  The flame isbeing gradually kindled.  Every day the governmentbecomes more powerless to quench it and when it finallybursts out the whole of North Germany will be ablazetogether,&apos;     Another material factor which has considerableindirect effect is the scarcity and high price of coal,Poor families find.it almost impossible to heat theirdwellings.  Any public meeting therefore combinesthe double attraction of excitement and warmth, andof these two the latter is undoubtedly the morepotent.  The middle classes who can afford It go tothe theatres and public dancos.  The poor who cannotbuy tickets for those entertainments fall back on political meetings where admittance is free.This may seem an.inadequate tause for a revolutionbut the&amp;t? is ro doubt that it has Its cumulative effect,     The Spurtec ists are clever in making use of the criminal element in establishing a sort of terrorism.Agents report that at their secret meetings a regulartraffic Is carried on in stolen goods, Includingeverything from gold watches to broad cards (whichnowadays are articles of almost equal value).Thieves and burglars find a ready market for theirwares and in return are prepared for any kind ofvillainy the leaders may desire.     During&quot;the recent outbreak In Mannheim on 22,2.19.the course of action adopted by the Spartacists was as follows,  A large meeting attended by some 10,000persons was held in tho main square of the town to register their horror at Eisner&apos;^ murder.  after some two hours of Inflammatory speeches, a processionstarted to march through the town.  It was led bythe chlof speakers and consisted of some 5,000 personsThey proceeded to the &quot;Landosgofa&quot;ngnisn released allthe prisoners and then set the building on fire.They then seized the Barracks of the 109th Regimentwhere the- single officer and handful of men occupyingthem made no attempt at resistance.  They also teottpossession of all the machine guns, rifles andammunition they found there -  The next move wasto tho Schloss, one wing of which is used for thecollection ofttaxes.  This was stormed and some fivemillion marks ,appropriated.  Another wing is usedfor keeping documents such as wills, contracts etcof all kinds.  All these were taken, thrown out ofwindows and burnt in large bonfires.  By the time this was ov*.r it was about 9 of clock in the evening and the mob began to disperse.  Small parties of ou anlid U he orIVci
criminals, released prisoners etc, were then formed,which went round to the houses of well-to-do citizens.,  -forced admittance and demanded first of all food,then fire-arms, then clothes.&apos; and finally money andjewellery.  Next morning placards were posted allover the town proclaiming the Rate-Republik for SouthGermany.&apos;  It was stated by people in Mennheim that none of the leaders of the outbreak and very few ofthe members, of those marauding parties were natives of Baden.     It is certainly true that Bolshevism finds inBaden and Bavaria a very much less fruitful soil thanin North.and Worth.East Germany.  The fact of therecent outbreaks in Mannheim and Munich should not beallowed to mislead anyone as to the true centre ofthe danger which is certainly Berlin.  The reasonsfor this are throe - the mixed nature of the populationincluding as it does numbers of Slavs and Jews,&apos;theproximity of Russia and direct Russian influence, andthe much more critical nature of the food and labour situation.The receptivity of the population for the germ of bolshevism is due, as has been said, first and foremostto the critical nature of the present food - situationand to their low state of health owing to prolongedUnderfeeding.  The most casual ohserver cannot fail to ridti&apos;c0: this in the appoarance of tho populationespecially in Berlin.  (It is said that conditionsin Saxony aro oven worse),.  Most of all the absenceof fat. has undoubtedly had a directly deleterious-effect on the brain.  Further the constant and ever-present anxiety as,to whether food would be procurablehas in the course of the last two years worked onpeople&apos;s nerves to a disastrous extent.  It cannot possibly be doubted that  the immediate arrival of acertain amount of fat and milk and the definitepromise of regular supplier, of the&apos; necessary foodstuffswould have an extremely far-reaching effect in calmingtho populace and would.with one blow knock away halftho platform of the Spartaoist.     Thi next factor in the situation is that of un-employment.  This is in a large measure bound up withthe food question since much of the &quot;unwillingness towork&quot; is- certainly due to weakness and apathy as aresult of underfeeding.  In the opinion of most ofthe labour experts, the high rate of unemployment pay and the-strikes for higher wages:aro due much more tothe high prices of food than to &apos;any definite working class movement,  If food were cheapened those questions would gradually settle themselves.  Thevery fact of Germany&apos;s desperate economic situationis a certain safeguard against extravagant demands inthis direction if once the food problem wore adjusted.     The greater part of the prevailing unemploymenthowever is due not to strikes or &quot;unwillingness towork&quot; but to actual lack of raw materials.  It ispractically impossible at present% to. surmount thedifficulties of the transport situation sinco thenecessary metals for the construction&apos;of locomotivesetc-, are unprocurable.  Goal, therefore, must beleft at the-pit mouth for lack of transport.  Thiscompels numerous factories to close down which might
otherwise continue work,  Ihu  a vicious circle is formed, from which It will only be possible to escapewhen raw materials are introduced.Source:1. Lt.Col.vonSonnenburg,Munich,2, Graf Bern-storff (lateambassador)*3.DR,Solf &amp;c.2,     The third factor is the delay in peace negotiatorand indefinite prolonging of the armistice.  This is acircumstance which is much exploited by the middle andparticularly governmental classes.  They are continually insisting that the petty annoyqa ces of thearmistice Conditions are gradually rousing the people to fury which will inevitably lead to Bolshevism andwill finally breed a spirit of hate and revenge moreterrible then anything mankind has yet experienced.     My own impression Is that the masses of the peoplwould not pay much attention to this if only they hadfood and work.  It is certain that the manufacturersfeel it very much and it is one of the causes of theirextreme timidity in starting enterprises *  In thisway therefore it reacts on the&apos; masses of the people in so far as it tends further to increase unemploymentIt is true tod that the feeling of animosity againstthe French who are regarded as responsible  for thearmistice is increasing daily.  But the most serious effect of the delay is that which it has on theGovernment.  The greatest difficulty of the governmentis that they can do nothing for the people.  Theycannot produce food nor work for peace,  It willprobably make very little difference what sort ofpeace it is.  There will be indignant protests ineny case.  But if it brings tho end of the blockadeit will be accepted by the masses of the people andas such will be a real counterblow to Bolshevism,Resistance to Bolshevism by (a) Government  (b) private individuals.(a)  The Government appears to be making a genuine effto resist the spread of Bolshevism but only with vorypartial success.  Indeed it may be regarded as certainthat without external aid these attempts are doomed tofailure.   Activity in this direction takes three forms :-   i,  Repression&quot; of the movement by force.   ii. Propaganda,   iii,Removing the causes of unrest by set isfying the       physical needs of the people.Source:1.Baron Thormann2.Various membersof politicalsecret police.   1,  The success of the first of these forms, of       activity depends of course upon, the number and       trustworthiness of the troops of which the       Government, can dispose, and upon the power an3       ability of their police whether secret or other     One of the first actions of the socialistgovernment which was set up in November last, was to abolish the secret police which had of course beena real instrument of tyranny under the old regime,Tho result however was that they were left withoutany organisation for watching the secret activitiesof the Spartacists who began to develop a systemof secret agents which is now at least ai effective Ias that of any monarchical despot,  It has been
 found neoessary  therefore  gradually to recall a certain number of  the  old  secret police for the purpose of  contre-espionage against Spartacist Agents The&quot; service however  is very much hampered by the fact that the Government dares not openly acknowledge its  existence,, and the members of the service thorn- selves are  both  uncertain  of  tho support they will- receive In  case  of difficulty and.also continually afraid that some new socialist minister may at any moment be appointed  who will  abolish the whole service again s*d  deprive  them of thoir means of livelihood.     &apos;.vho ordinary  police who  in former times consisted mainly of  non-commissioned officers ma do themselves  so unpopular in the past that under present circumstances  they have completely lost all control over  the population.  Thoy do not any longer exist  as  a  reliable factor in the situation. Their place is taken for the  most part by the so- called Ropublikanlsoho Soldatenwehri  This force consists of some 1,300 men and Is composed of tho Various &quot;V/ehre&quot;  raised by  different Socialist town Commandants (e.g.  Volkswehr,  Burgerwehr etc.) They wear,rod brassards &apos;and may be hired by individuals to:guard private  houses and are also stationed outside  certain  public buildings.  They consist mostly of  old  men  and young boys attracted&apos; By the idle life and high  rate of pay.  They are wholly unreliable  and In case of disturbances invariably  take  off  their  brassards and either melt away from the scene or actually join the rioters.   .Attempts  are being, made to romove them gradually to  the outlying  portions of the town  and replace thorn  by  the  troops of the Frelkorp3 Luttwitz.      This corps  consists of some g6,000 to 30,000 men and is  composed  of voluntary troops enlisted in the cadres  of the  old regiments e.g. Franzer regiment Reinhard^  regiment  (which is the old 4th Guards) &amp;c. In most cases these  &quot;regiments&quot; consist only of two or three  companies.   They  rotain a certain number of the old  officers  but are almost all subject  to tho control of the soldatenrate.      It Is  against these that the activity of  the&apos; Spartacist  agents  is farticularly directed and according to  the most recent  reports about l/3  of them are now  infected with the disease.  The^ ranzer Regiment has declared that it will go  over &quot;en masse&quot;  to the  Spartacists in  case of  trouble so as  to  avoid bloodshed.      Certain  units e*g.  that  commanded by Gorstenberg which  was sent  to  Bremen recently, are,still reliable but the general  impression is that in case of further outbreask  the troops  would cortainly  join the winning side.    If therefore the masses of  the population  were  opposed, to tho  Spartacists  (as they probably would be if  they wero wo11 fed and clothed)  then tho  troops would  not hesitate to  obey the orders  of their officers. , If however the population  showed  an inclination to  side with  the rioters the troops would at the best  take no  action.
iHTho total number of troops with tho colours inGermany amounts nor to something like 200,000*Of those the majority are under Hindenburg1scommand on tho East front.  They are for themoot part locally recruited but thoir leadersare&apos;;very much hampered by the activities cftho coldatenrato v/hich are at once more power-fultmd more radical jjn &quot;,ast Prussia than inany other part of Germany.  Further themethods of propaganda by which the RussianBolshevik leaders prepare the advance of the armies are bidding fair to paralyse anyre Distance by the German??.   .  To sum up in a few words the capacity of theGovernment for the repression of Folcheviam by force:-  the police are hampered in their activities and lack support, the garrisontroops can be depended upon to side with thomaftority, the trc-troops on the frontier areusslesfi unless they can bs made tn feel thattho country 13 solid behind them,     A g^od deal more might possibly be done liy theGovernment In tho direotion of explaining to thepeople by means ^f newspaper articles etc  -whatBolshevism in Russia really moans.  The masses of the people have ne conoeption of the con-ditlons actually pro-vale nt in that country.Thoy are constantly told &quot;iy tho Spartacistcthat it Is a Communist ?aradise ani they orenaturally unwilling to believe tho few nemborsof the supplies:-;r classes who have endeavoured toInform them of the truth.Source;Dr. Stadtlerof anti-Bolshevik Le-aftuc..     There are two reasons why the Government can do but little in this direction - one Is thatthe press campaigns of the last four years have produced In the population an attitude of suchunmitigated cynicism that they steadfastlyrefuse to&apos; believe anything the newspapers print.The second reason is that the Spartacists have avery ready way of dealing with newspapers whichprint anything thoy regard as dfuigorous.  Thoyturn machine-guns on to tiie building, storm itand throw the presses and tho staff bodily intothe street.  The &quot;7orwarts!l wa;  treated inthis way and as &amp; result the ether papers firnlyrefuse to print any. anti-bolshyvik propaganda.iii.        But neither of these methods,  force or       propaganda are,  or can be, of any avail unless       the Government is able to remove the r^al       causes of unrest   Unless they&apos; can provide       food, work and peace,  every other effort Is       useless *Co)     A society called the &quot;Antibbishevistiechehas been founded for fighting tho movement inall its forms.      moving spirit in thissociety is a certain Dr. Stadtler who has beanIn Russia during the greater pt rt of the war,first as a soldier tr.cn as a prisoner and finally as an official in the German Consulatein Moscow where he saw and opposed Vne pro-Lonin policycf the old Gorman Government.

Those agents declare their allegiance                  to  tho Spartacict- movement and so  obtain admission to                  the Secret meetings.  Thoirreports sre cent to a                  central office in  Berlin and copies are supplied to the                  Government and to  the commanders of  the British                  Garrison every fow days.  Financially, the society                  is nominally dependent on voluntary subscriptions:                  In fact it also receives a certain support from                  the.

Thoy all testify to  tho great rapidity of the                  growth of tho movement.                       $here is also a society in 3orlin cf amiable                  academic tendency  which meets weekly and discusses                  the-&quot;menace of Bolshevism&quot;.  Thoy  call themselves                  &quot;Solidarists&quot; an,\  Include among their members quite                  a number of distinguished men of science and letters.                  Tho chiof characteristic of such speeches as I heard                  was the feeling that &quot;to fight Bolshevism you must                  understand it&quot;*  This argument provided an excuse                  for endless analysis and classification in the boot                  German professional manner which WAD only dispelled                  by a member ,of the Russian  Cadet party who had                  escaped a few days previously  from Moscow and blow                  all thoir theories to the four quarters of heaven                  by  tho refreshing  blast, of  a few fact?: from his  own                  experience.                        Tho above is  mother instance of the fatal  di cease                  of  words&apos; which has spread over all Germany.  It  is                  a disease which appears to  induce,&apos;a  condition of                  complete physical  lethargy.  There &quot;1* no  :&quot;doubt that                  for this too  the  only medicine is  food.                        In certain country places there is  some evidence                  of  determined attempts  to resist  the Bolshevism  of                  the towns.  My only  personal experience  of this                  was in  tho neighbourhood of Mannheim.  Finding that                  all railway communication .was  out  off during the                  recent  disturbances  there on 22nd  and 23rd February,                  I managed with groat difficulty and  only  with  tho aid                  of  tho military commandant  of  tho  town--to secure a                  motor car, and proceeded in that manner  to Karlsruhe,                  About  20 miles from  Mannheim I.w.io held&apos;up outside                  a  country, village  by some youths with rifles and                   learnt  from thorn  that the chief police  officer of  tho                  district had  summoned a hundred of thorn  that morning                   (the- 23rd) to his  office, given them all  the riflec                  and ammunition ho  possessed .tvnd sent them out  on to                   the  roads  to  hold  up any Spartacists or  their agents                  who might  come that  way.  The  lrds seemed thoroughlyti
to enjoy the job and vowed they &quot;would have noBolcbevlcs in their village&quot;. In Karlsruhe theVth Array General Staff wore taking what measuresthey could to prevent the spread of the movement from Mcnhhoim to the rest of Baden.  It was thoywho had interrupted the train services in an.attom.ptcompletely to&apos; isolate the town.  Proclamations woreposted signed by the Baden Government and also bythe local ^orknens&apos; and Soldiers&apos;  Councils exhortingthe people to keep the peace &quot;in spite of their justindignation at the murders in Munich&quot;.  The proclama-tlons of these two separate ruthoritlos were postedside by side the former on white and tho latter, char-acteristically, on rod &quot;. sper, but tho tonour of thetwo was tho same.    This spirit, however, ia confined almost entirelyso far as I could discover, to South Germany.   It isprevalent in Baden and also, though to a leas  extent,in Bavaria and it is attributable partly to the factthat food conditions are loss bad there than In thenorth and partly also to the fact that the populationfeol that the French troops across the r;ver wouldprobably in tho last extremity be ready to supportthe forces of order, though indeed up to the present this prognostication has not boon justified by events.Is Bolchevisn being used by.-tho German...Government as aBogey to frighten the^Rntorite either for the purposeof extracting better peace&quot; terms prjts. an  excuse fora revival of militarism?     A categorical negative answer to this question would probably not bo entirely correct.  There is some reason to believe that a small party  of reae-tionaries (some of them in.. Government service), unrbleto rid themselves of thcirvnabits and ideals,aro still intriguing with this dangerous instrument.They believe that if thoy  could introduce  Bolchevismin S^tente countries, Germany would probably be thefirst to recover from it and the recovery  would takethe form of a. monarchical  reaction.  It must,  however be understood that this party is infinitesimally smalland entirely without Influence in Governmental,eommorcial, or any other circles.  The real dangerof Bolshevism for Germany  and the rest of  Europeremains none the loss imminent because a few madmenare so ill-advi ed as to toy with it.  If  a barristerdiscovers that the criminal ho is defending Is  suffer-ing from heart disease, he will use the disease as an argument in his defence; but that in no way preventstho disease from being both genuine and clangorous.     Any renewal of militarism  at tho pro sent time,or indeed for many years to come, is entirely cut oftho question.  If there 13 one sentiment in germany which lb absolutely genuine and universal  it is thehatred of tho soldiers and sailors for thoir officers,and all that is included in the word militarism.Any revival of that spirit or that system  is absolutelyunthinkable.
   parallel with this cr.ntimr.nt ia the contempt felt by military and civilians alike for tho Hohenzollorns,Tho Royal houses of Prussia, Bavaria and Saxony aroall commonly spoken of with&apos;&apos;hatred or  t tho leastscorn.  Even those rulers who are comparatively popular,-.s for example the Grand duke of Badon^ are regarded asbelonging to a past epoch.  In the course of a walk I took with Pitinco -Max of Baden I noticed that he w ,streated by. workmen, officials arid others he spoke toin terns of perfect equality, very different from thedeference formerly paid to a member of a Srand Ducalhouse.OUTGO   LI COL,ON SONNENKTURGwon, PrittwitzPIKCO Max offidcn fee.      There is, of course a.&apos;certain number  of people,   particularly women,,who  Indulge in  sentimental  talk .  about the fallen Emperor,   I saw in Oassel notices 1(  posted up In shop windows exhorting the  &quot;women  of   Germany to  join in  a protest against  any attack onV  the personal immunity of tho Kaiser&quot;,,  It is  in fact   possible that any violent primitive action in this   direction by the Entente would result in a wave of   indignation among certain classes and. would induce  a   dertain reaction of sentiment.  But even in these   eircwr^tsnees any return Off the dynasty  is certainly   out of the&apos;question.  There is only one  combination   of events which&apos;could render it possible,, namely tho   overthrow of the present Government and  the constitu-Lon   of a definitely Bolshovlc regime.

Source -von GrunsliusBerlin F.O.   It Is therefore essential that the present Government receive definite support from the Entente, It must be made clear that it Is with them and with them only that the Entente will treat and into their hands alone that food wil be delivered.,       There are certain practical questions connected with the manner of this delivery which are worth consideration.  It is the general opinion that the distribu and protection of the food should be left in the hands of t Government^   At most commissioners should be sent to super- vise and control the process.  At present the government probably still has sufficient pov/er to protect the food if were landed  at Hamburg or some other,port and transfer it t the necessary centre.  It is atated that there are certain reserves of  food-in Denmark which the Danish Government v^ou be vdlling to release for Germany if the Entente ^/ere to gi permission.   It cannot be insisted too1 strongly that largo quantities are necessary and still more, that a&apos;constant s for the next three or four months must-be promised If the ges of the disease of Bolchevlsm are to be checked.    Should serious disturbances arise in Berlin before food can be brought in, there is still, one possibility of revic- tualling the country and resisting the dangere  It might be possible  to send the food to South West Germany by the Rhine., &quot;This portion of the country is politically the lea, infected, and If the people of Bavaria and Baden were cert.of their food supply and of the support of the Entente, it.might be possible to erect here the last liine of defence against the  Bolchevics, should Prussia and Saxony be over   Another measure which would strike a heavy bio-/ at Bolch propaganda would be the artificial depreciation of the roil If the Entente vere to forbid any. bank out side Itussia to accept roubles as currency for a certain perlol of time, the Spartacists -:ould soon find their supply of funds running short, and there is no doubt that -* us si an money ; one of their most, potent instruments of propaganda.Some Germanse.g.  -WalterKathenau, Capt. vonArnim G.S.

The manufacturers admit,that they would  soonerfany indemnity than fall into the hands -of the Bolchevics iThe venkness of the German Government and the docility of people are such, that the supply of food could be accompan!by the imposition of any conditfons, military, political c&quot;economic, that might be desired.  Military authoritiesdeclare that Gormany would raise troops to fight underEnglish or American leadership agRinst &quot;the Folchevic armyiBusiness menddclare that commercially Germany coul \ be ninto a British&apos; colony.  For example a clause in the peacetreat to the effect that no firms financed by a givenpercentage of British capital should be subject to socialtion would create a demand for English and American capittv;hich vould place the greater part of German industry in control.  Pinally from a political point of vie1/ an unlifl!influence over the future of Germany could be obtainedespecially by England,
At the present time the Germans see their future destiny hovering in a sort of limbo between the Paradise of the Wilsonian promises and the inf? of French desires. The actual region to which it will be consigned is believed to depend on the influence exercised by England. The result is that they fear that England is behind France in any harshness they experience and doubt whether she is backing America when they  see signs of any amblioration in their condition. The possibility therefore from the extension of British influence is enormous.

There is a small party of political Journalist who write and speak in favour of a rapprochment with France,   still regarding the Anglo-Sax n race as the real enemy of Germany. It is curious to notice how no one in Germany seems to realise that any power with which a rapprochment is contemplated might conceivably be An-willing to adopt such a policy.

That lack of appreciation of foreign mentality which has always characterized the German is as ?lent as over and it is that fact undoubtedly which explains many of the impolitic utterances of German statesmen at the present time. But their incapacity to deal with the situation in no way lessons the reality of the ?anger. If the Spartacists are allowed a few weeks more for the development of their propaganda under the incre?sing stress of f?ine and unemployment, there is no question but that the whole country will be consumed by the flame of Bolchovism which will spr?d with suchrapldity that the waters of the Rhine will be incapable of checking its advance.
