 (THIS DOCUMENT IS Ti^JROPBriTY OF BIS BPITAMC MA JESTY&apos;S^ GOvlMBICT SECRET.              WAR  CABINET. G.T.  6906, ^   1    *       SI If,, FEIN PRISONERS,.,         Copy  of a letter from the Chief Secretarfor Ireland                  .to the Prime&apos; fcnis-ber.PRIVATEJc CONFIDENTIAL                                                       IRISH OFFICE,                                                     27th February,  1         My dear Prime Mini star,                I have just  returned from Ireland,  and I think         it right that I should place before you a statement with         regard to the position of Irish Prisoners, both.those who         have  been convicted and those who have been interned with-         out trial.   Before  I deal with the?e two different sec-         tions I  should like to say that 1 am alarmed at the etate         of the Irish Prisons..   I cannot imagine how they have         been  allowed  to continue in their present state.   Some of         them  are over 200 years old,, and the eel1B in them would&apos;         bo  condemned  by any sanitary authority-.  If anybody took         the trouble to make the necessary enquiries it would be         very  difficult for  us  to offer any explanation,  I appealed         to  the Home Office  to  let,me have the Chairman of the Prison         Commissioners of this  country to come over to inspect the         prisons,  and  to furnish me with a report,  but the Home Secre-       &apos;  tary  tells  me that  it  is impossible to  comply with my re-         quest,   In  the whole of Ireland there are only two  Convict         Prisons  and there are  only 14 Prisons in the whole  of the         country.  As  you will  see,  if. the number ofprisons is few         ana the  conditions  in  these are bad it  will be extremely         difficult for us to cope with any emergency that  might arise.               1,  I will now deal with the internees in this country,         A3  you know these were arrested,  deported without trial,  and
interned in this country last yeor.  In your absence their position was discussed by the War  Cabinet,  and it was decided by them that they should not be released.  My predecessorthought that&apos; they should have been released after the ElectionsAt that time His Excellency, the Lord Lieutenant, held adifferent view, but ^ince then he  has come unhesitatingly  -to the conclusion that it is absolutely essential to let them out.  With hi? view I soncur.  I think that I have shownyou hi&quot;! Memorandum explaining why he hag come to this firmconclusion.  In my judgment the one thing that if. keeping SinnFein alive at the present moment is the fact that the:*e menare kept interned in an alien country without trial-  the moderate people are inclined to sympathise with  them.  Ifthey were released at the present trme Sinn Pein would have nothing to go upon, -anu the cry which has been most useful to them after their farcical attempt to constitute a Parlia-ment and to carry its decrees into effect, would be gone..There is another&quot;consideration:&quot;as the Home Secretary willtell you, their-presence in this country has gone a longway to break down the discipline of tho prisons.  Sorne ofthem have escaped, no doubt with tho connivance  of disaffectedwarders; others are now in hospital outside the prisons.Per example, in Gloucester, where  there are ten  outside the prison because of an.epidemic due  to unhealthy conditions;tho*e that remain interned are breaking all the rules ofciiocipljne and make it impossible  for the warders to maintainit because of the conditions under which they are interned.       2.  CONVICTED PRISONERS.   These men are  interned inIreland.  I was&apos; appealed to to get them transferred to thiscountry because of the conditions  whichuTreferred to at the
beginning of my letter.   I appealed to the Uome Secretaryarain, and he wrote to me on the 20th of this month to saythat it was impossible for him to receive any of the ninety-seven, who could be&quot;transferred into any of the prisons inthis country,,   Those people are treated as political prisoners and receive, if well behaved, certain ameliorative conditionswhich differentia to them from other prisoners in the prison-.They are practically internees0   As you could not have anInternment Camp in Ireland as it would be tbo object of &apos;constant attack and therefore futile these men were sentto Belfast prison, :  I need not go into the history of theirdetention thereo   Suffice it to say that it has been one ofthe most unfortunate incidents in the vihole history of prisondiscipline!.   To begin with, it was. in my judgment, a mistakenpolicy to send men of that type into a City like Belfastc.particularly when they were given such freedom that the wholeprison was soon in their possession, to he the scene of riotand disorderi and to be damaged, in some parts to such an ex-tent that it was unrecognisable *   You will remember that aspecial Act was passed called the Special Commission (Belfast)Prison Act, 1918, for the purpose of enquiring into? and reporting, upon certain complaints as to the treatment ofprisoners in Belfast prison,.   Mr. Justice I)odd was appointedto be the Special Commissioner..   I have received a copy of his report to-day*   I am glad to say that in his conclusion heexonerates the prison officials from the cruel and unjustattacks that were made upon them;  but it is extremely sig-significant that he says &quot;but I may be permittee] to say the&quot;prison is not a suitable place for persons to whom so much&quot;freedom is accorded, and. to express a hope that Parliament,&quot;in -its wisdom^ may devise some means of relieving tho officials&quot;of the prison from the burden.&quot;
         Yesterday  I  saw the  Chairman  of  the Prisons Board, and     the  Medical  CommissionerThey  have  strongly represented  to     me verbally  and  in writing  that the  conditions in  the  prison     are  extremely  grave A  Many of the prisoners have  been     manacled for over three  weeks3 and there  is a danger of  some     of  them dying  upon our hands.   The  Medical Commissioner     says,  &quot;These prisoners are  all showing signs of marked anaemia     &quot;and general systematic  weakness, involving loss of weight, feeble      heart1s, action,.and a lowering of nervous vitality.....Under    &quot;existing conditions a stage will, in my opinion, shortly    /arrive when  a  complete breakdown  of  the health of  the    &quot;prisoners may  be anticipated,  involving the immediate  re-    &quot;lease  of the prisoners on medical grounds.&quot;         These prisoners are  in  a. different category from  the     &quot;internees in this country.    They have been duly con-     victed and there is not  the same  sympathy for  them, but     in  view of the medical reports  I  think the time has  come     when the question should be considered whether those  who     are  in a grave medical condition  should not be released,     and  whether  those who have  served six  months  of  their     sentence and who are feeling the  effects  of  it  -/ though     not  in such  a  grave degree  1* should  be released  also     when Thomas  Ashe died on our hands in  prison  he  did more     to  stimulate Sinn Feinism and disorder in Ireland  than     anything I know.         I knew how extremely busy you are, but I  venture  to     ask you, with  all earnestness,  to give a  moment  or two&apos;s     consideration  to the above  which  I felt bound  to  bring to     your notice  at the earliest possible opportunity.-                              Yours ev                                  (Sd)  Ian Macpherson.The Rt.Hon.The Prime  Minister,          Downing Street,
