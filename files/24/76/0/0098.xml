USB OF TROOPS  DURING THE  THREATENED  STRIKE.      (Circulated by the Koaia Secretary,)     I shall be glad IT have the decision  of the War Cabinet as to the use ofthe Military Forces of the Crown in aid  of the Civil Power during the impending strike.     The ordinary  practice before 1911 was that troops should be noved togive aid to the Civil Power only on a requisition FROM the CIVIL AUTHORITY.                                        i                         t     In 1911, during the railway strike, general AUTHORITY WAS GIVEN FOR theuse of the troops  to protect the railways  and to DEAL WITH DISORDER;  and troops were moved  by the Military Authorities WHEREVER THEY WERE REQUIRED.This gave rise to  a number of complaints from Looal AUTHORITIES WHOobjected to HAVING troops stationed in their areas WITHOUT APPLICATION fromthe Civil Authority.     In 1912, DURING the coal strike, while the general distribution oftroops WAS OF COURSE left to the Military  AUTHORITY, THE CABINET DECIDED THATthey should not be moved for the purpose of DEALING WITH ACTUAL OR THREATENEDdisturbance without the authority of the HOME SECRETARY.   THO STRIKE WSS ONthe whole a peaceful one, and it was only  ON THREE OR FOUR COCASIONS that troops were requisitioned.   Though in THE RESULT THIS ARRANGEMENT WORKEDsatisfactorily, it necessarily INVOLVED  SOME DELAY IN THE SMPIOYJRISNT OF THEtroops; and THE DECISION of the HOME SECRETARY HAD TO BE GIVEN ON SUCHimperfect information as might be received BY TELEGRAPH OR TELEPHONE.     I suggest that, if a strike on a large scale now OCCURS, GENERALauthority SHOULD BE given, as in 1911, for the USE of THE TROOPS in aid ofthe Civil Power, leaving it to the Military Authorities TO DECIDE AS occasion arises when and WHERE they should bo used  with or WITHOUT a REQUISITION FROMthe Magistrates.     I infer from  the instructions which tho Secretary of State for War has issued to Sir William Robertson that he  agrees with this view AND assumes thatthis will be the position during the strike.     I understand  further that the authority given by the Government for theuse of soldiers for carrying on essential  public services EXTENDS to the impending strike,  though I hope that the CALLS ON THEM for THIS purpose willbe few and that thoy will be left free for protection DUTY AND the maintenanceef order.                                             E.S.18th Maroh,  1919.
