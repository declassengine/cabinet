THE COMMITTEE considered the Bill Clause by              Clause, and made the following amendments.se 2(1]            THE LORD ADVOCATE inquired whether the power of              the Council under Olause 8 (i) to acquire land subject              to certain conditions at a price or rent greater than              that which would allow for the recoupment of expenses              could be exercised by the Board of Agriculture itself              when acting under Clause 2 (l).in default cf action              by the County Council.                    The Committee agreed that the point be                    referred to the Draughtsman to make it                    clear that the Board of Agriculture                    could exercise the same power.Is!..3_.il!           MR. LESLIE SCOTT suggested, that power to              County Councils should be inserted in Clause 3 (l)              to acquire land for public halls,  recreation grounds,              and common of pasture in accordance with Section 3,              Para. 18 to 23 and Section 9 of the Report of the3 SETTLEMENTILITIES BILL.
             the  Ministry  of Reconstruction  on  the Employment on the             Land of returned  Soldiers  and Sailors.                  The Committee  agreed  -                      That  the suggestion should be  conveyed to                      the Pre?kdent  of  the Board of  Agriculture. auee 8 (l)         It was decidea that the wording of the  Clause, should             be  amended  if  necessary to moke  it clear  that  the previous             consent of  the Board of Agriculture to  the power of the             Council to  acquire&apos;land for small holdings must be obtained             in  respect  of  each  particular scrxeme and  that  a general             consent to  the exercise of the power was  not intended. ause 9.;           SIR ARTHUR BOSCAWEN said that a question  of principle             was  involved as to  whether small holders  were  to &quot;be             allowed to purchase  their holdings, and if so, whether the             cost should be the  coat of acquisition  ov the market             value.                 The  Committee  decided :                      That  the tenant of a small holding should be                      permitted  to purchase his holding after the                      expiry of  7 years at the then  market price,                      provided that  deduction should be made of the                      value of all improvements made by the tenant, auae  11.          The  Committee  agreed at the request  of the Local&apos;             Government Board  that a period of 60 years be  substituted             for  80  years in the  last line of the Clause in order to             make it  consistent  with the period    allowed by the Local             Government Board  for houses erected under  the Housing of             the  Working Classes Acts. auge  12,          SIR  ARTHUR 30SCAVB5K produced a new Clause prepared             by the Board of Agriculture by which a  part of a park or             home farm could be  acquiredh^compu 1 s or ily provided that it             was  not  such part of a  park Thome farm as was required for ,             the  convenience or  amenity of a mansion house and the             order for tompulaory acquisition was confirmed by the Board                 M. LESLIE SCOT? objected to Clause 1. not apply-             ing  to parks as making  an unnecessary exception in             favour of park lands.                 It was pointed out that this was balanced by the part*             ial  exclusion  of small  holdings from the summary power             of acquisition .under Clause 1.  which was also proposed by             the new Clause.                 The Committee decided that the Clause should be                 inserted  in the Bill.aegean 14.          The Committee considered  whether the word0, in            brackets limiting  credit facilities to ex-service men            and to women who had been  employed on agricultural  work            during the war should be omitted.V&apos;   V   v
             THE LORD CHANCELLOR was  of  opinion that the limita-        tion was indefensible.             MR. ROBERTS  stated that  it  would be impossible to        defend the  exclusion  of munition workers from the benefit        of the Clause.             It was  pointed out that  the Treasury desired to        limit the scheme  to ex-service men.             The Committee agreed -                 That the words in brackets  should be                 omitted.             MR. LESLIE SCOTT suggested  that a Clause should be        inserted to  give  County Councils power -                              the             (l) to  arrange for/administering of a credit scheme                 through  the  Co-operative  Societies on the lines                 of  the report of Lord selbourne&apos;3 Committee                 on  Agriculture policy,.             (2) to  work  on small holdings through Co-operative                 Societies.             SIR ARTHUR BOSCAWEN pointed out that powers existed        under Section 49  of the small Holdings Act, 1908.             The Committee requested  Sir A-  Boscawen to confer        with Mr. Leslie Scott in the  matter, V.           SIR ARTHUR BOSCAWEN said that in view of the Cabinet        decision that Clause  25 (subsidies to private landowners)se 25.   should be excluded, the Board of Agriculture were of        opinion that Clauses  23, 24 and  26 were of no practical        utility and  that  the  limitations proposed by Clause 26        on the powers of  landowners would  not be sufficien*:ly        compensated  merely by the power  to make leans under Clauses        23 and 24.             The Committee agreed -                 That Clauses 23 to 26 should be deleted.se 27.        SIR ARTHUR BOSCAWEN explained that the consent of        the Treasury had  not  yet been obtained to the definition        of a small holding as a &quot;holding of  not less than half        an acre if  a cottage  is erected  thereon.11The Committee agreed unanimously -    To send a strong recommendation to the Treasury    in favour of the Clause and requested the    Parliamentary secretary to the Board of Agri-    culture to confer with the Treasury in the  matter.,  Whitehall  Gardnes, S.W,     8th Marsh, 1919.
