10th Maroh,  1919.              FORTNIGHTLY REPORT ON REVOLUTIONARY  ORGANISATIONS IN  THE UNITED  KINGDOM               AND MORALE ABROAD.C4&amp;);V                    &quot; ,                     -----   -  A .      (Circulated &quot;by the Home Secretary).          *376$ALL      &apos; Tho danger of a ooal strike, involving the  paralysis of all industrial  life, seems; to have been averted by the recent Conference, at least for a  time, and during the last fortnight there has been little aotive sedition  in Great Britain to record.   Revolutionary agitators are peculiarly  sensitive to publio opinion, which baajawoken to the perils of allowing them to    ply their trade with impunity.   They are still afraid of prosecution and it  is worth noting that the rather protracted proceedings against David Ramsay  at Bow Street Police Court for a seditious speech delivered at Croydon,  evoked no demonstration &apos;of sympathy from his supporters.       On the whole, the working women appear to be more contented than they  have been for some time.     Their great anxiety is a coal strike.       On the other hand, the underground activities of the extremists are  disquieting.   Through an unfortunate mistake on the part of an officer of the  Ministry of Labour, an invitation to attend the  Labour Conference was sent to  the Polioe Union, and&apos; a Metropolitan Police Constable named Marston was  included among the fifteen Labour representatives chosen to meet the  employers.   Marston is one of those who.hold that the,Police should side with  the men in any Labour disturbances.     The invitation is regarded as a  recognition of the Union by the Government - an  impression which the reply of  the Home Secretary to a question in the House of Commons that the Union is  not recognised, has not dispelled.   Agitators  in the Force claim the right   of the Union to interfere in matters of discipline, and  in the present  temper of the men selected by the Force to represent them  on the  Representative Board, it is feared that when disturbances  occur reliance is  not to be placed upon the Polic-e as a body.   Noil McLean, speaking against  tho Military Service Bill at Liverpool on the 2nd, to an audience which   included many Silver Badge men and soldiers in khaki,  said that the Polioe  were  now trade Unionists and would not lift a hand against their fellow :  workers.THE  SAILORS1 SOLDIERS AMD AIRMEN&apos;S UNION.        This very aotive and mischievous body, of which some  particulars were   given in my last report, is beooming bolder.   At first  it  followed the   example of the &quot;Comrades of the Great War&quot; in inviting men aotually serving  .   to  become Honorary members, but  it has lately issued a  leaflet  urging  that   .   soldiers should not interfere in Labour disturbances.    The  connection of   Captain Donisthorpe, the President, with the.Herald League,  and the fact that   Lieut-Commander Kenworthy,  of the Royal Navy, whose wife, lately inherited, a.   considerable&apos; fortune, is believed to be financing the Union,  invest it  with   an  importance it would  not  otherwise deserve,        The Executive  of the Union  are believed to have held a  meeting in
                                   - 2 -   London a few days ago,  at which &amp;enworthy,  Fairohild and other revolution-   aries were present,   Plans for a coup d^etftfr of a very childish   descriptions-were discussed,, and Kenworthy is asserted to have dealared   that tho Navy was ripe for mutiny *   Other1 speakers talked of arms andv,bbmbs   being socretly stored and of soldiers who wore ready to join them-in .    *v   establishing a republic.   There is&quot;&apos;no bause&apos; f-orj alarm in this, for such   talk is the stock in trade of these extremists when they get together&apos;, but   it shows the need for prompt prosecution whenever men such as Stanhope  -   give occasion for it,   The mattor is being further enquired into.  The   prosecution of ex-Sergeant Stanhope, the secrotary, for a speech  made  to   serving soldiors during the Strike on the tube railways is already being   considered.COUNTER MEASURES.        The publio seems now to be awake to the danger, and several  organisa*   tions to combat the evil have been hurriedly formed.   One of theso, the   National Security Union, has the support of Members of the House  of   Commons, including Trade Union leaders, and they intend to enlist public   opinion in support of the formation of a strong Special Constabulary Reserve   in all the large centres.   Other agencies are initiating a campaign of   anti-revolutionary propaganda, some by means of leaflets, and others by the   more effective method of mobilising loyal workmen in factories, working   men&apos;s clubs, andjpublic houses, to neutralise the poison instilled by the   extremists.   The results of their efforts are being watohed.&apos;  FORTY HOURS1 MOVEMENT.        My correspondents in various parts cf the country say that the men, as   a whfle, are against striking.   They would oome out if ordered to do  so by   their Executive Committees, but they would come out unwillingly,  and would   resume work at the earliest possible moment.   The extromists know this, and   aret modifying their policy accordingly,   Arthur McManus, one of the Clyde   deportees, is now  visiting the various Workers&apos; Committees, telling them  to   prepare for a general strike over the forty hours&apos; week on the 31st May,   hast week he was at Derby and Leicester,   His supporters in Scotland  are   subscribing a shilling a week to defray his expenses.   On the other hand,   George Peet, Of Manchester, confessed to one of my correspondents that the   engineers were disinclined to make any move.   The steadier men think  that  a.forty-four hours,&apos; week will eventually be granted, and that that will satisfy   everybody.        -My correspondents from Birmingham and Liverpool,-writing independently,   nay that a very active grievance at the moment is the shortage of liquor.   The mon have fastened upon the fact that even with a medical certificate   in cases of influenza, they cannot buy spirits, whereas, they say, well-to-   do people can have them when they like.   My Liverpool correspondent-   attributes seme of the unrest to the early closing of public houses.   In   hinjarea they have acted as meeting places where the men could discuss   politics and &quot;blow off steam&quot;.   They feel that the present restrictions are   an interference with their liberty, and they are more irritated than is&apos;
M 3 *&quot;   generally believed.THE CONSCRIPTION BILL.        There is an agitation in various parts of the country against the Con-   scription Bill, and the No-Conscription Fellowship, which is  not prosperous   financially, is U3ing it as a means for raising funds *    Ex-Private C.J.   Simmons, who has been mentioned in previous reports and belongs  to   Birmingham, has been addressing Meetings at Glasgow.   The Independent Labour   Party is also concentrating on opposition to tho Bill,THE INDEPENDENT LABOUR PARTY.        At one or two Independent Labour Party meetings in Leicester, speakers-   have alleged that-persons are touring the country recommending working-men to   buy fire-arms to be used against the capitalists.   The speakers suggest  that   these are Government &quot;agents provocateurs&quot; paid to incite the people to  .   violence, and that this has given the Government an excuse for using armed   force,   A certain type of extremist appears t&apos;e have the &quot;agent  provocateur&quot;   oh the. brain.        One of ray correspondents.describes the-audiences at these meetings.as   &quot;professional listeners&quot;, for the same persons attend week after week;in  \l .   all kinds of weather, and the numbers never seem to vary.  At Bradford and   Leeds the audiences are fairly large, because the Picture Houses are used,   and at Bradford an entertainment is given in addition to the  speeches&apos;..   At the other Yorkshire towns the attendance is insignificant.   It is  fair to   say, however, that none of the speakers at these-meetings ever talk ntw of   touching the Monarchy, and it is significant that Mr. George  Lansbury himself   in conversation with a friend in Paris the.other day, said that  while  he   wanted a Socialist State, he thought that the Throne should be maintained.THE DELAYS IN THE HOUSING SCHEME.                                     ,  .:  -   .        My Liverpool correspondent, wht is exceptionally well informed, says  -   that it is urgently necessary to make a start with the housing scheme.   In,.   and around Manchester the lack of houses is very keenly felt, and the  men are   now 3aying that the promises of the Prime Minister with regard to the&apos;housing   scheme was only an Election device,  - They do not, of course, understand&apos;the   amount of work that has to be done before the builders can get to work on&apos; a 1   site.    .  &apos;     .&apos;. -     v .   &apos;.-v,,.-.       -THE WALL SEND LABOUR COLLEGE.   &apos;&apos;*&apos;&apos;&quot;.--        ;.        James Stewart, of 15, Woodbine Avenue&apos;, Wall3end, a conscientious   objector and a member of&apos; the Independent Labour Party,  has.opened a shop  for   the sale&quot; of revolutionary literature.   He is an agent of the Socialist&quot;&quot;&apos;/   Labour Press, and he has now opened classes for &quot;&quot;teaching &quot;Sooial, Eo/momic,   and Industrial History&quot;,   He calls his shop a Labour College..   Xhe.. classes   are attended by a few youths of from eighteen to twenty-one,             -               -          -  - .                                 *THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF DISCHARGED. SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.        -        Meetings have been.hold in South Wales by this Society,  &quot;calling upon the   Government to prevent the exploitation of the labour &quot;of disabled sailors^ and
    soldiers,  and  pledging  tho members to  support the Trades Unions in the    event  of a strike  in  the  ooal fields,  and if called upon to take up arms,    to refuse  to do so.   They do not probably represent the majority of dis-    charged soldiers in the district. THE UNEMPLOYED BENEFIT SCHEME.        A well informed  correspondent on  the Clyde says that vote or no vote,    ,the railwaymen, miners.and transport  workers in the West of Sootland do    not want to come out.  The principal  local grievance is the payment of    unemployed benefits to.women and unmarried men.   They say .that a married    man who may lose his  work through illness gets 10s,Od. a week; even if he    has a  large family to support, whereas an unmarried man who gets dismissed    through his own fault gets 29s,Od. THE NATIONAL  COUNCIL  OF  CIVIL LIBERTIES.        Mr, Joseph King, who has become Treasurer of this Society, is making a  -  strong appeal  for  funds,  the Society having a deficit of  136.   His theme    is denunciation of the  Ministry of Information, the Public Health Bill, and    the Defence of the Realm  Regulations,    On the subject cf tho Public Health    Bill,.  Mr.  King remarks, &quot;We may soon be a nation of A.1 animals leading C.3,    lives&quot;. THE HERALD LEAGUE.        A man named Pollitt, of the Boilermakers&apos; Society, addressed an    audience at the Liberty Club, Finsbury Park,  of which a large number were    Russian Jews.    He said that we nearly had a  revolution a month ago, and    would  have done so if the leaders had  not been afraid of imprisonment.    The working classes,  he. said, cared  only for  beer, tobacco, and horseracing,    and it would  take  twenty  years to educate them.        Mr. George Lansbury  has founded another  Society, the National League    of Rights, to  protect the interests  of soldiers and sailors, discharged and    serving, and  their wives  and dependants.  Miss Sylvia Pankhurst is the ,    Honorary Secretary.        Mr. Lansbury  is  now  circulating a pamphlet, &quot;Fight the Famine&quot;, in    whioh  he pleads- for.a raising  of the blockade.   He says that in Berne he    intends to see Germans, Russians, and-Austrians, and tell them that in    England we want to forget the past and start  afresh.        Mr, Horman Angell  has  offered his help in making the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;  -  a success, &apos;  .                                    -&apos; &amp;ASG0W.        From  a number of censored letters from Glasgow to the United  States,    it appears that there is  aotive revolutionary feeling in the different    shops.  One  describes  the  I.W.W. as  &quot;the  only Union that matters&quot;.   A    woman  remarks  that her  son  is  &quot;the  sort that  wants a revolution&quot;.,  and that    &quot;the men  in the works have  tho  boys  spoiled&quot;.   Another writer says, &quot;There
                                       - 5 -   will *e revolution, for whioh I am ready to take my part in to-morrow.    It   lo up to us to see that we sup with a good long spoon,  and dip&apos;deep every&apos;   time11.   Another writer says that the only solution for unemployment ia &quot;to   follow Russia and Germany&quot;, and another that he is a Bolshevik and is out to   abolish the Parliamentary system.PROSECUTIONS.               ,        David Ramsey was sentenced to five month&apos;s imprisonment at Bow Street   on Saturday, and W.F. Watson was arrested on a similar charge.   Among   Watson&quot;s effects were found a. number of notices showing his efforts to-infect   sailors and soldiers-with sedition.   These have been handed ever to the   Counsel for prosecution,                       .  -,                                BOLSHEVISM ABROAD.  &apos;&quot;    &quot;/&apos;   &apos;                                    SUMMARY. :        During the past fortnight, Bolshevism has made&apos;progress in Bavaria and   other parts of Germany, and in Austria-Hungary,    The Governments of   Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Holland,Spain and Portugal, are actively   alive to the danger,. and-Bolshevism, as a consequence,- is not advancing,   though there have been disorders in,-the South of Spain of a Syndicalist nature.   In Italy reports seem to show that there is no immediate danger.   The most   active centres of propaganda at the. moment are- Denmark and Holland, and,-to   a lesser degree, Switzerland.                                    - ,  -FRANCE.        On the whole, ,the morale of the French during the .past fortnight is   reported to be good,   People are relieved of their anxiety about a fresh   outbreak of hostilities, and are plaaeed at the idea that the Germans:will   surrender material&apos;intact.                        ;  --.        .-.        The effect of the attack on.Monsieur Clemenc.eau-.has been to restore his   rather waning popularity among all classes but the&apos;extreme Socialists, who are   carrying on an agitation among the railway ^workers.-   Their.hostility is.   implacable, and a. week ago at the Batignolles sheds, -an effigy of Monsieur   Clemenceau was put in a coffin and a mock funeral service was held, with cries   such as, &quot;En voila un de moins&quot;,&quot;Vive Gaillaux&quot;, &quot;C&apos;est Caillaux qu&apos;il nous   faut&quot;, and the singing of &quot;1&apos;Internationale&quot;. &apos;  The meeting was small.        Three persons named Mannilsky, Davtian, and a woman named Armand, who   landed at Dunkirk with some French citizens repatriated from Russia, as   delegates of the Bolshevik Red Cross&apos;, are reported to have brought with them   1,500,000 roubles.   The money has been detained by the Authorities, pending   investigation&apos;. :                       &quot;            .        Meerheim, addressing a...meeting of the Confederation Generale du Travail   at Lyons on February 15th, while defending the Bolshevik Government in Russia   against the charges appearing in the Press, declared that a strike  in France   would be a terrible error and ah attempted revolution a ridiculous /failure.
                                   ** b ** :SWITZERLAND.        The Swiss Government&apos;ic seriously alarned at the  position in Germany.   While the  Swiss think that Bolshevism is probably dying, at its roots  in  ,   Russia, they dread v/hat nay happen if it spreads&apos;widely, in Germany.        Platten, who is  of German birthj recently naturalised,  and is now the   leader of  the revolutionary party in Switzerland,  has  left that oountry,   ostensibly for Russia, but in reality to consult  the Spartaoist leaders  in   Germany.   (The latest information ia that he was arrested at Mannheim,  in   connection with the Spaftaoist disturbances).  The Swiss Government   willingly let him go  and would have been glad t*)  prevent his.return,  but   they were  anxious to  do nothing that would give the Socialists the excuse   for saying that they  were persecuted.        A split seems to bo developing botweon the two branches of the   Socialists.   Orimm Is appealing to his followers to separate themselves   from Platten and his  Bolshevik polioy,        Scldatenrato (Soldiers&apos; Councils) are known  to exist in the Swiss   Army.   Each hac a small Executive Council in Communication with the  Central   Council,                                      i        On February 14th,.the National Council considered the spread of   revolutionary propaganda among the Troops,   A proclamation has been   issued, prohibiting meetings ,for undermining military  discipline, and   providing heavy penalties for the dissemination of false news.  It is   hoped that demobilisation will ease the situation, as  the men are more   difficult  to get at when they are scattered in their homes.        Dr. Parvus Helphand, when recently arrested, had  nothing in his  ,   effects to oonnect him with the Bolsheviks.    Whatever his mission may  be^   and it is  certainly not friendly to the Allies -  it is.not tho spreading   of Bolshevik propaganda.        The Persian Minister, Zoka-ed-Dowleh, has just arrived In Berne.   He came from Berlin,  and is reported to be conducting  Bolshevik propa- &apos;   ganda with funds from Stockholm.   The relations  between Persia and   Switzerland are scarcely sufficient to justify the appointment of a   Minister..        About 30,000 cartridges have been stolen from the Thun Munition   Factory, and they are said to be buried at Seeback.BELGIUM.        The situation in Belgium appears to be a little better, though the   reoent sporadic strides seem to be less political than economic in   connection with the eight hours&apos; day.   It is not thought&apos; at present  that   there will be any serious outbreak in Antwerp, in spite of the alarmist   rumours that have been circulated.GERMANY,      ;  Whatever may have boen the policy of the Gorman Government a few
   weeks ago,  there is now no doubt that the Government, as well as the German   people, are  in a state bordering on punib at the progress of Bolshevism,   Some, weeks  ago the strength.of the Spartaoist group was estimated at 2,000,000   of  whom.230,000 were deserters;  it must have increased since this estimate   was made.    The success of the Spartacists.  in Buvuria has enormously   impressed public opinion.   Officer belonging to tho Junker class have beon   pressing into the hands of Allied Officers  brochures pointing out that   Germany should be the one&apos;bulwark of civilisation against tho comnon danger,   but sho can only be made so by quick supplies of food and ra&apos;.v material:  &apos;if   she succumbs, they say, the existence of the remaining European States will  .   be  in jeopardy. .. When due allowance.is.-made for tho trickery.of German   propagandists, there seems no reason to doubt that in this instance the fear   is  quite genuine and the remedy proposed the only effective one;  at the same   tine, it is  impossible to boliove that Bolshevism triumphant in Germany could   ever take the same form as in Russia.  1 The masses are hungry;  their   vitality is  lowered;  there is little employment and a black future:  in such   an  atmosphere the first onset of Bolshevism is bound to have some initial    ,   success, but. in the end.natural,stolidity and love of order are bound to make   themselves  felt, .   .    ,  1 .. ,. , .    . -                              :       Radek,  the Bclshevik emissary, hits&apos; been arrested, and is believed to be   in  the Moabit Prison,   Me Claims to be tried by Germans of his own way of   thinking.       For the moment, by making concessions, the Government appears to have   restored order in Berlin, but it i*3 only for the moment. At One of the   Spartacist  keetings, the Chairman said  that the corn supplies would not last   beyond the  middle of March,&quot; that they would then have the whole of the   proletariat behind them,&apos;and that&apos; comrades  were coming from Russia to help   them.   At  another Mooting it wa;s decided to undertake sabotage of railways,   telegraphs  and telephones, in order to  cut  Berlin off from the rest Of   Germany.       Muhlon, who paid a flying visit to Bavaria, says&apos; that the country ia in   process of  dissolution, and the same phenomena as were apparent in Russia at   the tine of tho Bolshevik Revolution have appeared there.   This pessimism   may bo excessive, but certainly a Bolshevik Bwaria would re-act very  strongly   on  Germany, Switzerland, and, indeed the whole of Europe,       Baron  Eckhardstein:has stated that he&apos; joined the Inner Council of the   Gorman Independent Socialist Party throe months ago;  that they have 2%000,000   roubles in  gold in Berlin for propaganda in England;  that agents have boon   chosen and  passports prepared;  that it is  recognised that Bolshevik efforts   must be concentrated upon England, which is now tho only sane country, in the   hope that tho United States will follow.    He described the Scheidemann   Cabinet as. on the verge  of collapse,ITALY.       In political and business circles  there are many rumours of Bolshevik   agitation.-   For three  days during the  week ending March 1st all tho daily
   newspapers in Rome,  except the  Socialist  organs  and  the  &quot;Populo Romano&quot;   (which employs non-Union labour)  were  shut  down  by a strike, and  it  is   said that the National Federation of Labour   threatening  the Government   with a general strike.   On the other  hand, outside  a few fanatics in the   Executive Committee  of the Official Socialist  Party,  suoh as Bombacci and   Lazzari, there does  not appear  to be real Bolshevism,        An Italian deserter named  Prfcbo Fioranzano,  who had lately been a   member of the Red Guard in Russia,  was detained  at Newcastle on his   arrival, and handed  over to the Italian Authorities  for  repatriation,GREECE.        Bolshevism is penetrating  into Greece,   The Socialist Deputy,  .   Cburiel, is reported to have handed to the  Editor of the &quot;Rizospastis&quot;   250,000 francs to be distributed to propagandist agents.        The Russian Archimudrite Serge, well known  for  his  Bolshevist .  sentiments, is a frequent visitor to the  office  of the &quot;Rizospa3tis&quot;,&apos;RUSSIA. .&apos;        Mr, Philips Price, who has been the  subject of  several Parliamentary   Questions, is believed to have  left this  country in  November, 1914,  before   passports were strictly investigated.   .-He  is  now reported  to be  at  the   Hotel Adler, Schaffhausen, having arrived from Augsberg, Bavaria.    He   may be on his way to England, but probably  the French und Italian   Authorities will decline to-allow him  to  cross the frontier.        The socialists, including  Mr,  Ramsay Macdonald,  chosen to investigate   Bolshevik conditions in Russia, are expected to  assemble in Stockholm   within the next few  days.   Asked whether the  French Government would   allow the French Socialists to  go,  Cachin,  the constant  contributor  tc   &quot;L^umanite&quot;, said that ha thought that this would depend on.the  view taken   by Mr, Lloyd George  as regards  the granting of passports to the English   delegates.       Bfoxton is to go as Secretary.     ..  It is reported  that there  are a thousand  new cases  of  typhus weekly   in MOBOOWJ  the hospitals.are overflowing,  and there is  a shortage of  .   doctors, medicines and milk.   The population is said to have shrunk to   400,000,        Evidence continues to accumulate  that  the Bolshevik Oligarchy is   everywhere losing its supporters, ,and  that  it  would  not; take very much   effort to&apos;overturn it in Petrograd.        There is a split in the Russian Social Democratic Party over the  &quot;action of the Central Committee in giving support to the Bolsheviks, with   tne&quot;result that the  more sober  Mensheviks have formed a  new Party, with  a  &apos; programme of economic regeneration of  Russia by  attracting  capital and   restoring the means  of p&apos;reduction,   It appeals  for  foreign oapital.        An American report states  that 60,000  workmen are on strike  in   Petrograd, as a protest against the War and that the livestock in Russia
   has shrunken by nine-tenths;  half the stook in the  Northern Provinces   slaughtered for food is suffering from disease.        The &quot;Pravda&quot; recently contained a statement by  Lenin  that  in the large   cities the members of the Communistic organisation had fallen from  50.000 to   7.000 and the loyalty, even of these, to the Bolshevik ideals was doubtful.        The Bolsheviks are reported to be making great  play with their British   prisoners.   While Officers are Confined in dungeons,  the  men (e.g, Naval   ratings and some fifty men of ihe Royal Soots) are oomfortably  housed in. an   annexe to the office of the Bolshevik Propaganda Department, and are being   well fed and kindly treated.   This may explain the  delay  in exchanging  the   prisoners for Raskolnikoff, who is now hold at Brixton as  a hostage.   If   these prisoners become Bolshevik agents, as is not impossible,  the  question   of how they are to be dealt with on their return to  this country must be   seriously considered by the Military Authorities,   They  are still serving   soldiers. &apos;        A party of French Officers who have been in prison for six months in   Russia have just been repatriated.   They were liberated at the instance of   the notorious Captain Jacques Sadoul, the Bolshevist propagandist.   Ho  sent   by one of them a letter to Cachin, of the &quot;Humanite&quot;,  part of which was   published in the &quot;Temps&quot;&quot;of last Monday,   It is an  apologia for&apos;this Bolshevik-   movement.FINLAND.        Bolshevist propaganda in Finland does not appear  to be prospering, most   of the agitators having been arrested,   German influenoe  is said to be   increasing, and Mannerheim and Enkel are finding it  difficult to maintain   their positions.        Mr* Gulling, the Chairman of the Bank of Finland  and  Holsingfors, is a   Socialist, and apparently a Bolshevist agent.
