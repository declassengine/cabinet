BRITISH POLICY A3 REGARDS THE AMERICAN NAVAL PROGRAMISFFLQXANDUIU-by. Admiral  Sir,  W.L.Graiytr         A considerable  section  of  U.S.  educated or wealthy classes s actively pro-British and  as. such  whole-heartedly endorses theBritish point  of view  as  regards  a predominant  Navy-   In fact,  its -advocacy&apos;approaches  the indiscreet and causes some irritation among those not holding  the  same strong opinions,   This section has been largely re aforced during the  past year or more owing to contact withand a better knowledge of British of a representative type, who havebosn present in the  country  in considerable  numbers.   Tne value  ofthis intimate  association and  mutual understanding can hardly beoverstated.    The  majority of  the remainder  of  the above classes,while not actively pro-British, recognises what Britain has donebring the war and is  prepared to take a sympathetic view of theBritish^ standpoint,  provided that standpoint be placed squarelybefore it.   It includes  many  Senators,&apos;Congressmen, Politicians and ffliblic man of  the  bftttor  anrl hmaAnv tvna..    This nlftss as a wbr.l A This class as a whole    demand for a big    LOGICALLY RENDERINGADVANCEDsxmuitanecasljueagtio ox public men of the better and broader type lis disgusted by the manner in which the present II.S,.

The&apos;bulk of THE population are, in spite AND because OF their jjnblic and political education, NOT actively anti-BRITISH BUT  llatantly pan-america   They can be swayed by careful leading (ALONG right lines and to counteract baneful influences, but any ill&quot; IJFTDGED action en our part might be fanned to produce among  them such pave of spread-eagleism as&quot;to force their Government to carry  through thr biggest Navy programme, even if the President does  not pal-ay mean or wish to do so, and this in-spite of  the fact that the BUN try at large is indifferent to a big Navy and will&apos;be strongly prso to  the&apos;increased taxation involved and to the acceptance [if any external responsibilities or liabilities beyond their perished Monroe doctrine,   There are many Senators, Congressmen ltd politicians who belong to this class, who, not  moving in the hue social circles, never hear the British point of view,  and who, lit is te be feared, are only too ready to listen&apos; to anything anti-   ,tish or to mistruct or distort anything said or  done by  the  BRITISH.     It is a curious fact that, in spite of all argument  and [^presentation, the broader minded American without exception  insists that the education and enlightment of  the American  masses as  to THO  knesty of British motives and as to  the greatness of  their  feievement and self sacrifice during  the war must  be undertaken by  h British themselves and cannot and will not be done from within.     There is, of course, a large actively anti-British  element in  h U.S., mainly Irish and German,&quot; but, unfortunately,&apos;persistently  Ppported and encouraged by many politicians and  others&apos; who have  not  fc same excuse.   These are wholly unscrupulous  and  will seise  kn anything said or done,  distort  or even  invent, in  order to get  pat  they regard as  the best possible  material.to advance their own  Jlitical ends or notoriety,  and it  is a  sorry fact that such matter  (ill still always obtain a ready hearing in  the  U.S.                                                    &apos;   The
    The largo Navy idea is  supported &quot;by the President and SecretaryIniels, the latter being probably tho pawn of tho former, and it hasle support of all the thick and &quot;thin supporters of the PresidentId * -   of all the anti-British elomonts.&quot;   It has the support of ae Navy generally, who, apart from, those who have served in Europe                       &apos;         &quot;&quot;                   &quot;             WITH                                       T    The more  enlightened  elements,  and especially  those  of  tho  oublican party, will  not willingly endorse  it,;.  especially  to  the  int  of creating ill-will between  tho  two  conntrios,  and it will1 :obably not be  endorsed by  the  country at  large  unless we, by  ill- vised action,  render  it  possible  for  thoso  who  desire it to carry   through on  a  wave of popular  spread-eagleism.   Any action taken I us will require  the  greatest  possible  tact and discretion and lould be such that it  will  bo impossible for any word or action of iurs  to be used by publication  by  those who  desire  it for the imenting of popular feeling,    Tho British caso,  so  far as the Government is  concerned, should,1; is  thought, be advanced so far as is possible  in  private and by   lament.   British and Imperial responsibilities and  needs and their   al  dependence on the protection  of their communications and food  ipplies&apos; must  be made clear, as  also the  impossibility of entrusting  .o safeguarding of these  to others  who. however, loyally thoy might  ter  into partnership, could not be expected and undoubtedly would  t under certain easily conceivable conditions,  however  admittedly  stifiable, employ their  forces in  matters which their country  uld repudiate&apos;as&quot; outside their province or  responsibility.    Sentiment carries  weight in the U.S,,  and the  feeling in Great  itain and throughout  the &quot;Empire ihat.  their  very existence depends  on a predominant Navy, that&apos;it has many times in  the past been the  ly bar between them and  utter  destruction,  that it is&apos; believed by  om to have preserved  at  the same  time the freedom  of the world at  irge, and that  it is regarded by them  as a birthright which no  ivernment would dare to compromise,  and that public sentiment would  vor allow such abrogation,&quot; should  be  advanced,  and then the  thinkable possibility that if  II, S,  persist  the  so-called League of  tions and reduction of armaments will resolve itself into com-  titive naval armaments between U.S. and. Groat Britain,  ins toad of  twoen Great  Britain and  Germany,  as it was  before  the war,    It must be  made clear that  under no circumstances whatever..will  eat Britain  surrender her  responsibility  to her Empire  or  to  the  oild at large, and that  those  responsibilities  entail for her a  edominant Navy, and this should be done in  such a  way that it is possible for the President or  his  friends in his political  mpaign to quote from  word  or writing  anything which,  couldbe jstorted to carry U.S. public opinion  in the way he might con- iivably  desire/                   .           &apos;    The probable ultimate U.S.  desire  will be to fix  their Naval landard on what thoy call the 50-5.0 basis, i.e.  an  equality with  is country (anything  beyond this  is almost  certainly bluff) on  e grounds&apos; that&quot; they &quot;cannot leave  their interests  to  be  protected   the British Pleet, especially while  we are allied with the  pane sc.   They say we can  fix  our  strength  according to our fsponsibilities, which they recognise  are  great, requiring strength,  d that they  will  then merely equal us,   Any arguments  based  on [rength proportional to interests, and  responsibilities and  depre- ^ting mistrust  shown of us  may  be  listened to but  will very likely   met with the  demand  as  to what agreement or guarantee  can be  v.e,n by us which can be convincing&apos;and can bo used by those who                                                            have
save to assure the U.S. public that a big Navy for them is necessary,    Tho fundamental idea now generally prevalent in      is  that&apos;the ture of the world is in the hands of tte Ihglish speaking races,Biat theso must be united in the closest union; and that the  forcesat their disposal will be used jointly for the sole purpose of pre-wwi UP&quot; or wnf nrci TIP1 rinnop..   Trio art ant to wVinh ffhn 11.R, nbonl ft  h.:vmpathios.    Any idea of war between the two countries is regardedis unthinkable.    For these reasons any argument based upon possible conflict1st we en the  two  countries must be eliminated.  It would at once, iftsed, induce a competition in naval armaments between us.   %at weire asking U.S.  is to trust us and to sink their national pride,ihich demands that the naval forces at disposal should be equallyiivided between us.    The argument that the respective naval armaments of the twojountries must necessarily be apportioned to the share taken by eachia the white man-1s burden might carry considerable weight.    At bottom thoir desire for equality can only be because they;jo not-prepared to leave themselves, as they believe, at our mercy,ad this argues  mistrust of us.   Such mistrust  cuts to the rootjf their fundamental principle of complete unity, at which theyprofessedly aim, and appears to be really the only argument which!sn bo used to induce them to accept our views as to the relativeaval force necessary to and to be maintained by the two countriesrespectively,             ,    The time for us publicly to admit to creating a strengthgreater than we  should otherwise desire will be when they actuallywmmence thoir own increase, raid not before.   In the meantime, would suggest we fix and publish the minimum strength wo adopt as apolicy and to which we intend  to build up or gradually reduce, at thesame time making it clear that this is done regardless of U.S*,Aoso present programme is1 not taken seriously.&quot;   Our standard willidouVtedly be&apos;adopted by II.S. as their standard, to which they willrelatively build.  Then -chore will be groat controversy in U.S., and Id their Government will be pinned the odium of any increase intheir relative power.   When they have fixed their policy it willbe quite time enough for us publicly to modify ours as may belecessary owing  to&quot;their action.                           (Sgd)  W.L.
