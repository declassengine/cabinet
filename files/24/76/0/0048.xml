His  tinLi.i&apos;V.7 ( &apos; I &apos;WAR  CABINET.                                                                            4551nfHA&quot;M    circtiiate this memorandum by Mr. E. F. Wise, a principal Assistant Secretary of^r^the Ministry of Food, who was sent to Germany by the Ministry in connection with the    work of the  Supreme Economic Council.                                                                         W. S.  C.         6th March, 1919.NOTE  ON  FOOD  SUPPLIES  FOR  THE   LEFT   BANK  OF                             THE  RHINE.     The following notes are based on discussions with General Plumer,  General Give and members of their staffs at Cologne ; with  General McHardy at Advanced General Headquarters at Spa ; &quot;with M. Tirard and other officials connected with the work of the Luxembourg Committee, and with various German officials.     Quantity of supplies available. There is no  question but that there is already a serious shortage of  food supplies and that this is causing considerable suffering among the poorer  classes of the population, both in occupied and unoccupied Germany.  Save for insignificant quantities  of herrings and  vegetables there has been  practically no import of food since the Armistice.  The Berlin food authorities  have already notified the occupied areas that after the middle of March, no further allocations of grain, or potatoes can be expected from the rest  of Germany.     The  supply of fats and meat from the rest of Germany has already ceased and supplies on the left bank are short.  Consequently, unless  food is at once imported there will he famine in a very few weeks and an absolute breakdown in supplies  before the next harvest.  There is a general concensus of opinion that it is too much to expect that in these circumstances order can be maintained.  -     If this occurs the position of the occupied armies will  become very difficult and may become critical.  Neither British  nor  American  troops will  at  all relish the task of policing  and repressing a starving population, and disaffection among the troops may add to the intrinsic difficulty of controlling industrial towns in which a large proportion of the  population is unemployed or hungry, or both ;  and  starvation and unemployment provide a fruitful soil for  Bolshevist  teachings,  and there is little doubt that the industrial and the political disorders over the rest of Germany seem to he on the increase from a military point of view it would be the height of folly to run any risk of trouble. behind the lines at a  time when it may  be necessary  to advance further into Germany to enforce terms of peace.  Further, it  is  of very great  importance  that by  contrast with the rest of Germany  the  territories occupied by the Allied Armies  should  be content and reasonably well fed.   This will enormously simplify the task of a further advance into Germany if such an advance is to be made.    There may be military reasons for  maintaining strictly the blockade on unoccupied Germany, though this is by no  means certain,  but there can be no military reasons against feeding the  occupied  territories.   Even  if there were,  it  is the  Allied Governments who will be held responsible  for sufferings to the civilian  population of the occupied territories and for any difficulties that may arise therefrom.    For the delay in putting food into unoccupied Germany the default of the German Government in carrying out the terms of the  Armistice as to merchant  ships and in providing finance can be  held properly responsible.  But no  such justification can bealleged with regard to the territories administered by the Allies in regard to which theresponsibility of the German Government is merely nominal.    Public  opinion  in  this country  and  America  shed no tears over the  vigorousenforcement of the blockade with  the view of starving Germany so  long as  the warlasted, but since the war has ceased the  contact  between the British  and Americansoldiers and  the German civil population  has  profoundly  modified the point of view of    (B19/138)  70 3/19  H&amp;S  6943wo
the soldiers.  It is open to doubt whether public opinion in this &quot;country or in america would be  prepared  to acquit  the  Government of  criminal negligence  if the  civilpopulation of the territories administered by the Allied Armies is allowed to starve.   Itis submitted, therefore, that for military, humanitarian  and political reasons the Alliesmust see that sufficient food is available for the population of the occupied territories.     Payment for foodstuffs. Eveiy effort should of course be made to secure payment for foodstuffs in convenient neutral commerces.   But if  this is  not at present possibleit is urged that the military situation requires  that food should be supplied in advanceof payment otherwise than in marks.     The  Rhineland  includes a  disproportionate  share of the  industrial wealth  ofGermany.  Its industries contributed a large share  to. the  pre-war export trade of theEmpire.   It is practically certain, so soon as  its industries  are  restarted it will be ableto raise the exchange necessary to provide payment for  the food supplied to it, thoughit may not be able to do that in  advance of the supply of food.     If once the population gets out of hand, credits will be much more difficult to raise,and  consequently the chances of being able to secure payment are diminished by each week&apos;s delay.  Food, therefore, up to the minimum quantities  agreed  by the militaryauthorities and  the  Supreme Council as essential, should be  supplied without  delayagainst payment in marks.     Method of distribution and  administration. Food supplies should be consigned tothe order of the Allied military authorities, who would arrange distribution throughthe  existing  German  Food  Administration.   In  the   British   occupied  area  theRegierungsprasident at Cologne  is the responsible official.   The territory is divided  up into districts, each of which has a more or less efficient Local Food Control Organization.The Army authorities would supervise the working of the machinery, but the actualexecutive arrangements would be made by the  existing  German authorities.     It is essential that the whole of the food imported  should  come in  bulk under theorder of the  Food Control authorities.  Only by this means can  evasion of the foodrules, Schleichhandel, as it is called, be avoided.     A suggestion has been made that the situation would  be immediately improved bypermitting unrestricted   import  by  private purchase  from neutral countries.   Somesupplies could undoubtedly be obtained in this manner, but it  is  improbable that the quantities would be sufficient, and in  any case  the  distribution of such  supplies would present very considerable difficulties.   Experience of food  control in Great Britain hasshown that more difficulties have been caused by the rich  getting  more than their fair share than by the smallness of general rations,   In  Germany also the British militaryauthorities and the German officials agree in anticipating  that unequal distribution islikely to lead to  as great  or greater difficulties  as reduced supplies.     The supply of  food is the first  and  most vital  necessity.   The  supply of rawmaterial for industry is nearly as important, if disorder and internal difficulties are  tobe avoided.  The number of unemployed in  Cologne is already  very  great, and hasshown some signs of.increasing.   The sooner Germany can  get her industries started on some basis or other the sooner will she be able -to pay both for  imported  foodstuffs andfor the devastation she has wrought  in Northern France and Belgium.   The provisionof essential raw materials should, therefore,  be taken in hand  as  soon  as the primarynecessity of minimum foodstuffs  has been supplied.     Economic organization of the occupied  territories. At the  present moment eachAllied Army has an economic section whose  work is co-ordinated  by a Committee  atLuxembourg, responsible  to M.  Tirard,  the  Controller General  of the whole occupied territory, who himself reports to Marshal Foch.  Further,  the Luxembourg Committee,as well as the various Armies refer a certain number of questions to  a  Committee  inParis  presided over  by   M.  Seydoux, which  has  been set up to deal  with questions connected with  the blockade.   There  is on  the  Luxembourg Committee a French,American and Belgian representative, but at present no permanent  British representativehas been appointed.  The duty of  the  Committee is limited to the  consideration of ndustrial questions affecting the industries of the occupied  territories and of transactions jet ween the occupied territories and  the rest of Germany.  It does not concern  itself with food matters, save in so far as they arise out of trading relations between occupied and unoccupied Germany.     It  is suggested that the scope of the Luxembourg Committee should be extended to  include questions of internal food control and food organization and of civil adminis- tration  generally.   In respect of such matters the Army Commands should continue to retain their executive responsibilities.  But the Luxembourg Committee should act as a clearing  house  of information and should secure co-ordination of policy throughout the
occupied area.  M. Tirard should become Chairman of this Committee and a competentBritish  representative of general administrative experience and corresponding standingshould be appointed.    The Luxembourg Committee should refer points ofprinciple and policy and should report from time  to time  to the Supreme Economic Council in Paris.   The supreme economic Council should appoint an Inter-Allied Committee at Paris for the purpose ofdealing  in  the first place  with any such  references and for co-ordinating  the policy adopted with regard to the occupied territories with the general policy to be  applied tothe whole German Empire.                             i.
