CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BOARD FOR                                         1,  Sanctuary Buildings,                                                 Great Smith GtnfMst^                                                         London, S.viL:80*                                                  lat March 1919.     Sir,                 I am directed by tho  Conciliation and Arbitration     Board for  Government  Employees  to state that their attention     has been called to  the  following  resolution of the Trades     Union Congress:                &quot;That this Congress  strongly protects against the           methods of procedure of the Conciliation and Arbitration        &quot;   Board for Government Employees,  and instructs the           Parliamentary Committee to  press  for the full and           complete recognition of Trade Unioniadfn all disputes           between the Government and  its employees.&quot;                 The important point of policy involved in the     question whether outside  Trades Unions  should be recognised as     representing Government employees is not witbJhthe Boards     province,  and they  express no opinion upon it.  But they     would observe that  cases  not infrequently oome before them     in which a substantial  majority of the  applicant clans are     in fact  members of  such a union,  and the ^Departments con-     corned have in fact negotiated  with the officials of the Union     as representing them.   In such  cases the restrictive wcrds in     thalr T*rme of Reference  place  the Board in an anomalous     position,   Not only are they given the  appearance cf limiting     a right  freely conceded by the  Government,  but the pvr.vif.don     that  the single Union Official  permitted to appear before     them  must  not be a  signatory of an agreement arrived at by      conciliation has proved  practically unworkable,  since  in the     ordinary course it  is in  him that the power to bird the     applicant  class is  vested.   The Board have been obliged to     overcome this difficulty  by allowing him to countersign     the agreement in hie  official capacity,  but this is neither     satisfactory to the Unions concerned nor does it commend     itself to  the Board as  being in accordance with the spirit     of their Terms of Reference.                 I am also to  point  out that the words in     question,  if strictly interpreted,  would preclude a paid     official of a purely  service organisation from signing     an agreement arrived  at by conciliation,  and this,  they     apprehend,  was not  the  intention  of His Majesty&apos;s Government.1 am,  Sir,   Your obedient Servant,        (Sd) S.A.
