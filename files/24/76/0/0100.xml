SECRET   This Document IsJJ^PWfl!!^Por the information, of Members, of the  Board.,-/foil    vr^mL4P?HI:-IOIATKL OF MATTERS Q,F NA7AL INTHFFISTI  loJJo1  W/                                                    II          &apos;0f the 5 Submarines reported in last week!s  Appreciationto have left Heligoland for Harwich only 3 have arrived.   One,probably U.B. 133&apos;,. without engines or crew,  was picked up  hya Dutch trawler and taken to imuiden and the fifth has not yetbeen found.          On Saturday last a group of 10 German Submarines into of tugs commenced the voyage from tho Elbe to Harwich,  butas the result of a collision&quot; one of the tugs was sent  intoBremerhaven with the Submarine she was towing, thus $reducingthe number in this group to 9.          It is reported that the Esthonians have laid a mine-field off Shepelev and that they have a reserve of 1,000 smalland 80 large mines.          Wo further action is reported from Archangel,  but arrangements are being made to send a squadron of 6 Seaplanesthrough the ice to Archangel as soon as possible.  Twelve  specialmines &quot;are also being sent to mine the river if necessary.                            ADRIATIC.          There is no change in the Adriatic situation.   Thesituation at Pola is calm and the work of taking the  Inventoryis proceeding slowly and as no real check can be kept on the figures without maintaining a large staff the Allies acceptthe Italian figures as correct.          Shipping at Trieste is not congested and there are 14,000 tons of flour and grain in the warehouses in  the Post.The warehouses are in a dirty condition and Italian shins arelying idle.          The French and American representatives at  Borne havingbeen instructed to urge the Italian Government to accept theproposals of the Admirals Committee in regard to Piume,  ourown representative will act isith them.          The Italians have assumed control of the Whiteheadworks at Piurae and are providing money to- keep them going. Thelocal managers wish to close down, as the work done is ui^remunerative and the Italians are therefore piling up debt against the Company.   It is suggested that if any control isnecessary it should&quot;be undertaken by a Commission of  the Allies.          Zara is entirely under Italian control, and the Jugo-Slavs complain as usual of oppressive treatment.          The situation at Spalato is outwardlv quiet but areport.from the Admirals Committee shows that the Italian
delegates fre mently demand an Allied occupation of the town.This demand probably represents an intention to pursue thesame line of policy which led to the occupation of Fiurne.The British and French delegates strongly op-nose the pro-posal as being unjust and unnecessary and likely seriously to affect Italian-Serbian relations.   *          The attack on Italian naval offi cers a t Spalatofollowed on a political meeting, and a proposed demonstration of welcome, organised by the Italian Club on the arrival ofan Italian man-of-war.   Anti.-Italian feeling is intense, andthe attitude of the Italians ashore and afloat is not con-ducivefofe keeping the peace, and gives the impression oftheir not being averse to a conflagration.   Complete order has prevailed since the arrival oi the Admirals Committee onFebruary 24th. and in this respect the town compares veryfavourably with Fiume.  The President of the provincial government seems a level headed&apos;man.   The population numbers24,000, of whom about 2,500 are Italian, or Italian in sympathy.   The Serbian garrison of 800 is orderly, welldisciplined and sufficient.  If the present control by theU.S.A&quot;. Admiral with Inter-Allied, patrols is maintained, thereshould be no further disorders, but on the departure of theAdmirals Committee naval force^ adequate to land strongpatrols if necessary, should be maintained.          The Commodore commanding the British Adriatic force is inclined to think the best course would be to leave theItalians and local inhabitants to settle their own difficulties,on the declaration of Peace, but failing this he considers itabsolutely essential to maintain not less than 4 Cruisers inthe Adriatic both before and when Peace is decla red.  Thisis also the decided opinion of the British  Selegate on theAdmirals Committee.          Very little progress is being made in clearing the mine-fields. &apos; The weather&quot;has been unfavourable and some of themethods employed are elementary, but in the zone under AdmiralMillo, with headquarters at Seoenico, very good progress is beingmade and the Dalmatian coast should soon be clear of mines.          A battalion of 1,000 British troops has been trans-ported to San Giovanni di Medua to relieve the 400 men of theGarrison Battalion now at Scutari.          The Brindisi base wi 11 be finally closed on 31stMarch.-                               BLACK  SEA,                 The present situation in South Russia is very serious       and co-operation between the French and the Volunteer Army is       essential.   Allied troops evacuated Kherson on 8th March and       Nikolaev on the 12th;  both towns being abandoned to the Bolshe-       boisheviks.   The remainder,of the German troops, not yet evacuated,       -(about 4,000) are aasrttikolaev awaiting steamers.  There has       been no collision between them and the&quot;Bolsheviks, and it is       understood that arrangements have been made with the latter       to hasten the evacuation.   All British subjects who elected^       -^o leave Nikolaev, were successfully removed, except one       family which could not be located.                 The Southern Crimea, is also in a state of unrest       owing to the approach of the Bolsheviks and the pro-Bolshevik       feeling of the workmen at Sevastopol.    The Rear Admiral,
inBlack Sea, is sending reinforcements to Sevastopol,  and preparations are being made to evacuate refugees.          The ex-Turkish. Hospital Ship &quot;Ak-Deniz&quot;  will sailshortly with German troops to be repatriated to a  North seaport,          The Foreign Office hesitates to approve  the proposal that Messrs. Tickers and Armstrong be asked to take  over Con-stantinople -Dockyard, fearing that such a scheme might lead to political complications, and set in motion a general scrambleto revive all sorts of concessions which have &quot;been lying dormantduring the war.                         CASPIAN.          The Roar Admiral reports having hoisted his flagin. lord..S.. &quot;Asia&quot; on the 7th March.          The Bolshevik members of the crews of the Russianflotilla are being detained and the remainder released.,  the rear Admiral proposes to take up the ex-Russian ships,&quot;Lieutenant Schmidt&quot;, &quot;Orlionok&quot; and &quot;Jupiter&quot; for which crews ,will be required but does not propose to take up &quot;Kars&quot;,&quot;Ardagan&quot; c.nd &quot;Astrabad&quot; presumably mving to difficulties inregard to the supply of ammunition.          The details of the three ships proposed to betaken up are believed to be as follows   &quot;Lieutenant Schmidt&quot;.... 5 x&apos;4*7&quot;   -    15 knots                            2 x 4&quot;         fitted with W/T.   Complement 65.   &quot;Qrlionok&quot;.............. 3 x 3&quot;   High angle guns         Capable of horizontal fire,   &quot;Jupiter&quot;............... 1 x 12 pdr.   .          It is assumed that the two latter will be re-armed and it is considered that 160 Officers and men will be required.          The Rear Admiral proposes to establish.a patrol of3 ships and seaplanes on a line from Chechen Island toAlexahdrovsk, supported by the remaining available ships atPetrovsk, for the purpose of stopping raiders and observingthe Bolshevik fleet,.          It is not anticipated that General Denikin will beable to march on Astrakhan&quot;, for some time.  He is at presenttransferring troops from the Terek Province to check theBolshevik advance on the River Don.          The &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, carrying 30 D;H. 9a machines,sailed for Batoum on 12th March.                        . FRANCE.          The French Sloop &quot;Kersaint&quot;, ashore on Morea Island, is now reported as a total wreck.          The French battleships &quot;Mirabeau&quot; is still ashore offSevastopol.  Hope of refloating her has not beaigiven up,.butit will&apos;be necessary to remove&apos;her guns.
          The latest proposal put forward hy France for thereconstruction of their Merchant Navy is that all shins built by the Allies during the war should be pooled,,Idmiralty,  S.W61.18th March, 1919
