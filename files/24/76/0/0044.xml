(This  document IK  tho property of His  Britannic  Haj^ty&apos;s                                           Government)                   W A R   C  A B I M-   TRevised5.3.&quot; 15by the Minister of ReconstructionUi\TS--PLOYkENT IIssSTtfUNCE .MEMORANDUMon     The out-o?f-work donation scheme has been extended for afurther six months and will expire towards the end of November.It was laid down when the scheme was originally announced thatit was &quot;a purely emergency measure&quot; and that the Government were&quot;pressing forward with their scheme for general contributoryinsurance which will be based on permanent consideration.&quot;     It is important that the Government should agree upon thegeneral principles of a permanent schemes without delay as theworking out of details and the negotiations with employers&apos;associations and trade unions which will be involved will takeconsiderable time.   The new scheme should come into operationwhen the out-of-work donation scheme for civil war workers corneato an end,  . The. Joint Industrial Committee which is noiar sittingmight be asked to consider the general framework of the Govern-ment&apos;s proposals with a view to obtaining support for them atthe National Conference which is to he held on April 4th,     Since the passage of the National Insurance Act&apos;, 1911,changes hive taken place in industry.   The res has been a consid-erabie growth of organisation and more recently the Governmenthas deeply committed itself to the principle of industrial self-government.   This development must clearly be taken into  account in :iny new scheme of unemployment Insurance.   In practice thiswould mean that industries with industrial Councils, -r otheradequate joint muchinorv ef employersrand employed, would,subject
to tho conditions laid down by the State, be allowed to frameand work their own scheme of unemployment insurance.   Thurewould need te be a State scheme for trades without &quot;special schemes&quot; ef this kind.     There are several advantages in adopting this principle.&apos;-       (1)   The Government would take a big step in             furtherance of the movement towards             Indus trial self-government.       (2)   It would increase the prestige and power             of Industrial Councils as representative             of the constitutional bodies in industry.       (3)   It would enable Industrial Ceuncils to             deal with the part:eelsr problem of             Unemployment^ym^nt in their ;*rn industries             in &apos;their own w*y, and prpvsde an             incentive to tetter acorumic org^nisa-             tien and greater efficiency,       (4)   It would be possible for industries to             initiate other benefits. e.-g. disability             benefits, stpp1e^entsry eld age pensions,             special arrangements ftr short time,etc.5,3.19A.
