The question of a further  reduction in the price of imported meat  was againdiscussed, and it was  proposed that the price should be reduced  either  by 3d. per lb.. on  May 1st and Id. per lb. on July 1st, or by 2d.  per  lb. on May 1st and 2d.per lb. on July 1st.  No definite decision was, however, reached  owing to  the repre-sentatives of H.M. Treasury being unwilling at the present stage to undertake liability for certain charges  put forward by the Ministry of Food in order to effect these reductions.    Food Council. Meetings  of  the  Council  were held on  February  28th  and march 4th.       ;    Reductions in the prices of certain cereals (maize, peas, beans, &amp;c.) were approved ;the reductions in the wholesale  prices will be made from March 17th, and in the retail prices from April 1st.   .                                                       .    Upon the question of supply and distribution of cheese, it was decided-       &quot;       (1) that  the supplies  in sight warranted  the abolition of the present system of             distribution.       (2) that application should  be made to H.M. Treasury for sanction to the             purchase of the exportable surplus  of Canadian cheese, in addition to             the Australian cheese coming  forward;  and  that all possible steps             should be taken to obtain this amount at less than 23 cents per lb., the             price at present offered.    The potato situation was also considered  by the  Council.  It was agreed that, inview  of  the  various representations now being made,  a memorandum  stating the exact position  of  the  Ministry in regard  to payment of compensation  should be forwarded to the Cabinet  for their information.  As regards export, it was reportedthat it was  doubtful whether  the  French Government  could take delivery of any large amount over and   above  the  present contract for 200,000  tons  owing tocongestion of ports ; but that it was expected that sanction would be given by theChancellor of the Exchequer for the sale of potatoes to Germany  and it was proposedthat strong pressure should then be placed upon the Shipping Controller to providetonnage.

    The question of reducing the manufacturing costs and the price of margarine wasconsidered in relation to the necessity for maintaining a satisfactory  quality.   It wasdecided     (1) to abolish, statutory specifications, while requiring all proposed specifications           and  prices to be submitted and retaining power to disapprove of any           proposals.     (2)  to sell oils at the following prices:               Palm kernel,. 63Z. per ton.              Coconut, 64L 10s. per ton.&quot;         *              Ground nut, 65L per ton.              American cotton oil, 951. per ton.     (3)  to retain maximum retail prices.     The question of the continuance of Clause  1  of the Bread Order, 1918, according to which bread must not be sold until 12 hours after it has been made, was referred to the Consumers&apos; Council for consideration in the first  instance.   This clause is no longer required for the purposes of the Ministry of  Food, but is being maintained at the request of the Ministry of Labour.     Consumers&apos; Council. The Council met on March 5th.   The following were the principal resolutions passed :            (1) The Council having  had under consideration the  conditions now       prevailing  in  Eastern  and  South-Eastern  and  Central Europe,  are of the       opinion that unless speedy help is forthcoming, millions of men, women and       children now inhabiting these countries will be overwhelmed  with famine, and    .&apos;   that the  economic ruin of the  countries  concerned  will be  complete.  They       believe that the danger is imminent, and  that  the misery and suffering of the       people has reached such a height as to move all humane men and women to       pity and dismay, and that the disastrous  consequences  to be expected would       involve not only  these  unhappy nations but the whole of  civilisation.  They       therefore urge that the Associated Governments shall deal without delay with       the question  of  relief, and arrange for the immediate despatch  and dis-       tribution of food  and for the means  of  reinstating transport, and thus remove       the most serious menace now threatening the peace of the world.           (2) The Council draws attention to the unfortunate result  of premature       removal  of  control,  and  views with apprehension  the organised attempt to       bring about a general withdrawal of Food Control.   The Council believes that       if this attempt is successful, although a temporary reduction of  some  articles       of food may be effected by artificial means, the  result in face of the  world&apos;s       situation will  be  further  profiteering at  the expense of the. consumer.  The       Council urges  upon the Food Controller and the Government the necessity of       continuing these methods of control which have been so successful during the       war in keeping down profiteering and equalising distribution until such times       as, in view of all circumstances, release can safely be effected.                            SUPPLIES  AND DISTRIBUTION.I    Meat. At the special Labour Conference held on March 1st, the financial arrange- ments of the Meat Section were explained in detail, it being explained how the flat rate at which meat is sold had been fixed in such a way  that the losses on purchases in North America were balanced by profits on  purchases made  elsewhere.  The Conference expressed its satisfaction with the  way in which  the  Ministry had dealt with the problem.     The Meat Trade  Advisory Committee,  which  was appointed for the purpose of advising  the  Ministry  on  technical  questions  involved  in the  de-control of meat supplies, has approved the  outline of a  scheme of de-control prepared by the Meat Section, and has agreed to certain orders prescribing the. maximum prices to be paid by importers for frozen meat and authorising the Food Controller to requisition all such meat on  arrival.  The object of these  orders would be to  enable  the  Food Controller to control any free shipment of meat which may arrive before the control of distribution ceases.     Bacon, Rams and Lard. Purchases have  been  completed in  the  United States for 25,000 tons, and in  Canada for 10,000 tons.  The adequacy of wholesalers&apos; stocks throughout the country is being  kept under observation by means of fortnightlyreturns.
    Fish. There has been, an increase in the supplies of fish in the Northern Division.In the North-Eastern Division supplies have been uncertain and prices have fluctuatedaccordingly.  , Seventy trawlers are awaiting repair, the work being held up by thestrike  of  the boilermakers and shipwrights.   In the&apos; North-Western Division thesupplies of fish have greatly increased ; in this  Division 8 out of  35  released trawlershave  been refitted and used for fishing, and 11 Dutch  boats have also been madeavailable.  *  In the North Midland Division supplies at  the  port of Grimsby have been well maintained.   In this  connection  it.is  to  be noted that &amp;t a meeting of  Grimsbytrawler owners it was agreed that, notwithstanding the withdrawal of control, catchesshould not be sold at prices exceeding those in the control schedule recently in force.&apos;    In the North and West of Scotland catches of herrings  and white fish have beenpoor, but  the prices have been below the maximum owing to  the  arrival of largequantities of  Norwegian herrings.    The removal of control is viewed wdth some  apprehension by several  of  theCommissioners as likely to lead to a  rise in price in spite of  the considerable increasein supplies.    Milk. Supplies of milk are rapidly increasing in most parts  of  the country, andthe chief difficulty in the immediate future will be the proper disposal of the surplusproduced  by the abnormally  early  spring  flush.   The general demand will  beincreased by the immediate  withdrawal of the Milk (Restriction in Establishments)Order,  the   Ice  Cream  (Restriction)  Order, and  Clause  1 of  the  Use  of  Milk(Licensing) Order, which restricts the use  of milk in the manufacture of chocolate,confectionery, &amp;c.    Steps have been taken to ensure a continuance of milk supplies in urban districts in the event of a transport strike.    The Ministry  are  pressing&apos; on orders, for  10,000 standard 10-gallon  churnsfrom Woolwich and 8,500 from private manufacturers in  order to remedy the presentshortage of churns.    The Travelling Commission appointed to inquire into the cost of - milk production has made the following interim recommendation  to the Food Controller :            &quot; This Commission, which is how considering the cost of production of       milk,  recommends that maximum prices should be  fixed for milk  both for    ,  summer 1919 and winter 1919-20, and  is of opinion that it is  essential, in       order  to obtain supplies, that  the maximum prices fixed should  be such as to       afford  a  reasonable  profit;  and  further  recommends  that an  immediate       announcement on these lines should be made by the Food Controller.&quot;    This  recommendation  is  being  considered  in conjunction with  the general problem of the future of milk control.    Potatoes. A  deputation  of  potato growers, including representatives  of theParliamentary Agricultural Committee of the House of Commons,  was. received by thePresident of the Board of Agriculture and the Food Controller on February 28th. whenthe liabilities of the Government in regard to the 1918 potato crop were discussed.    Jam. Ample supplies  of orange marmalade are available  in  all  parts  of thecountry.   There, are very  few complaints  in  regard to the shortage  of  jam andthe Ministry has only been asked to supply 25 tons weekly during the past month to meet shortages.    Attention has been  drawn to contracts which  have been and are being made between jam manufacturers, fruit dealers, and fruit growers for various kinds of fruitto be delivered during the coming season at prices greatly in excess of those obtaininglast season.   The  Food Controller  has intimated that, should evidence continue to accumulate  that  fruit prices are likely  to reach  unreasonable  limits  during the approaching  season through speculation at  this juncture, he  will consider it his duty to re-impose  the control exercised during the  past two seasons.    Jam manufacturers  have also been reminded that  the Orders controlling jamprices are still in force and will not  be revoked until it is  certain that the prices ofjams and marmalade will as  a result of supply and demand fall below the presentmaximum prices, and that should  there be a fruit crop of average size during thecoming season any revision of jam prices will be in the nature of a reduction.    Tea. Arrangements have now been made with the distributing trade for the transition from control to freedom of distribution and prices,
                                        4  -     A ballot was held on March 3rd, and a further ballot will be held on March 24th.Licensed wholesalers will receive their  ordinary  rebates on  all National Control Teawhich was balloted before March 3rd.  Up to March 24th these teas may be sold only under National Control  conditions but after that date  they  may be sold  at varyingprices.     Licensees under the ballot who have  received supplies of tea in excess of theirapplications will  receive a rebate of 3d. per lb. on the stocks of such teas in their possession on.March 24th  in  order that these excess  quantities may be put on thesame basis as tea balloted under the new  conditions.   No other rebates will be paid and no compensation will be given to wholesalers or retailers in respect of any stocksheld on March 24th.                          .                               .,     Dried Fruits. 6,000 tons  of currants and 5,000 tons  of Persian  dates havearrived during  the week, and are being put into   distribution  forthwith.   since february 17th approximately 20,000 tons of various dried fruits have beeu  distributed to the trade.     Cocoa. Large quantities of raw cocoa have been distributed to the manufacturers.The total  amount distributed since January  1st, 1919 is 20,000  tons,  and  manu-facturers now hold considerable  stocks.     Shipments and arrivals continue to be satisfactory.,               ORDERS  UNDER DEFENCE OF THE  REALM REGULATIONS.     A notice dated  27th February  1919, revokes  the Barley (Restriction) Order, 1917,and the Cereals (Restriction) Orders, 1918, as from the 1st March.  The restrictions onthe use of barley, except for the manufacture of malt, are thereby removed.     A notice dated 7th February 1919,  revokes as from the 1st  March the Sugar(Brewers&apos;  Restriction) Orders, 1917 and 1918.   A licence is no longer necessary toenable brewers to obtain low  grade sugai^,  nor are there now  any restrictions as to thequantity of such sugar which brewers may use.     The Edible  Oils (Maximum Prices) Order, 1919, dated 28th February 1919, fixesmaximum prices for cotton seed oil and various other oils.  Hitherto no maximum pricehas been fixed for these  oils in small quantities, as practically all were distributed inthe manufacture of compound.   It is now possible to release  them for retail trade.     An Order dated the 28th February  1919 amending the Intoxicating Liquor (output and Delivery  Order, 1917, permits an increase of  50 per cent, in the amount of  spiritsallowed to be delivered under the principal Order.6!     An Order amending the  Meat (Maximum Prices)  Order,  1917, dated 1st  March1919, reduces the  wholesale price of  beef, mutton,  lamb  and  veal  as  from 3rdMarch.  The retail prices also are reduced by 2d. per lb.                             ENFORCEMENT OF  ORDERS.     The total number of prosecutions during the week  ended February 22nd was 785,of which 702 resulted in convictions.   Prosecutions were reported under 68 differentOrders.     At Woolwich a firm was  fined 100Z. and 51.  5s. costs  for selling  cheese above themaximum price.     At Tamworth a wine and spirit merchant was charged 246L in fines and costs forselling whisky at 12s. Qd. a bottle, instead  of at the maximum price of 9s.             PART  IL-SUMMARY OF  THE  FOOD POSITION.                                    IMPORTS.    Though the total imports of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs in the weekended March 1st (118,200) tons increased  somewhat  on those of the two precedingweeks they were still below the average of the first nine weeks of the calendar year(161,500 tons) or of the first 26 weeks of  the cereal year (174,200 tons).  Wheat and flour imports (29,000 tons as  equivalent  grain) were again low, as also were  barley(2,500 tons), oats (600 tons), rice (none), and sugar  (8,000 tons).  Apart from these articles,  imports showed an  all-round improvement, especially maize (22,600 tons),meat (18,800 tons), bacon (15,400 tons), lard (3,000 tons), cheese (2,800 tons), condensed

Flour. The rapid increase in  the quantity of  flour delivered  from the mills orreleased from imported supplies during the present year shows signs of easing off, theincrease for  civilian consumption  in  the last  period quoted  in  Table B  (1) beingcounterbalanced  by the  reduction  in estimated   army  requirements.   It may be observed that the total increase  of supplies  in the first eight weeks of the year overthe normal  rate of  consumption of the latter part  of last year amounts to about one week&apos;s supply.  While this increase is no doubt due  in  part to the permission givento consumers to hold private- stocks, the  bulk  of  the additional supplies has passed into local trade stocks  which have been  built up  under the Ministry as a protection against possible temporary dislocation  of the means of transport.     Butchers Meat. In the third week of February there was  a* tendency for home supplies in Great Britain  to fall off in anticipation  of the  further rise of  prices to farmers on 1st March.  This movement within the month is illustrated in the following-table, which shows  the  numbers of fat cattle and sheep recorded as stalled in GreatBritain, also the corresponding variations in the issues of imported meat: Week ended	Cattle Stalled.

Fruit imports  were  somewhat less thanthose pi the preceding week, though there was a good supply of apples (7,900 tons).    In the  following table are given  the total  imports of the principal foods for thefirst half of the cereal year 1918-19,  together with the increases and  decreases onthe first  half of 1917-18.   The most  noteworthy feature  in  the comparison is  thelarge.increase in imports of wheat combined with decreases in flour and cereals otherthan wheat.  The. change  in the percentage  of dilution required in the regulationflour, culminating in the restoration of the white  loaf, .and the increase in the eon-sumption of flour (indicated in Table B (1)) have been factors affecting the position.The imports of meat are not materially greater than in the  first half of  the preceding year, but the large increases in bacon and lard, as well as  in condensed milk, clearlyshow the effect of  the Ministry&apos;s purchases in America, while  the  disappearance of margarine as an import marks the substitution of British for  the  foreign-made product.As  regards  sugar it  will be seen that  the decrease in imports was very considerable and it was necessary  to conserve stocks until  hostilities were  suspended.  The  tablealso shows a relatively large decrease in cheese imports and increases in butter, tea,coffee and cocoa.
    These  figures  do not represent total  home  supplies, which  apart  from  thefluctuations within  the month  are  coming forward well up to  anticipations.   In thefour weeks ended 22nd  February average weekly supplies of home-grown  meat inGreat Britain are estimated at 14,600 tons, while the distribution of imported meataveraged 8,600 tons.  A  year ago  the corresponding quantities were 13,600 tons ofhome meat and 5,900 tons of imported meat.   Estimated total consumption of rationedmeats  continued below  the ration  quantity, that for  the four weeks  ended 22ndFebruary being 5 per  cent, below the quantity to which the public are entitled on thecoupons phis the additional allowances now made to butchers and caterers.    Fish. Supplies of fish both at Billingsgate and in the principal inland marketsduring the first three weeks of February &quot;showed a great improvement on those for january.
