            HOUSING  BILL,     The Committee, which was appointed by the WarCabinet Car- Cabinet 541  (1) )  mot to settle thedetails of the draft of - a Dill to amend the enactments relating to the housing of the working classes andthe acquisition of small duellings.   They consideredtho Clauses and Schedules of the draft Bill seriatimwhich they approved with the following amendments:-     A reference to the Town Planning Bill to beincluded in the Title.     Clause 1 (1) page 1, line 10, &quot;three&quot; to be sub-stituted for &quot;six&quot; before the words &quot;months after thepassing of this Act&quot;.               (Note:  this amendment was made when the                         ,;,ar Cabinet considered the draft.)     Clause 1 (3) page 2, the Clause to read as follows&quot;that where, in the opinion of the Local Government Board,the scheme was not adequate or suitable, the LocalGovernment Board should be empowered to&apos; compel them toprepare an adequate scheme.&quot;               (Note:  this amendment was made by the                         v&apos;ar Cabinet with the exception                          that the word &quot;them&quot; was sub-                          stituted by the Committee for                          the words  local authority&quot;                          suggested by the &quot;*ar Cabinet.)     Clause 4 (2) page 3, the Committee had some discussion on this Section.     Mr, Symonds desired  that words should be added toenable the Local Authorities to borrow money.   TheCommittee requested Mr,. Symonds to confer with sir frederick Liddell on the  matter.-     Clause .5 page 3,  line  38, the word &quot;adequate&quot; to beinserted before -the word  &quot;scheme&quot;*   The line to read&quot;...,to make an adequate  scheme and to carry the  scheme....&apos;     Clause 6 (1) lines 7-9, the words &quot;to whom the
powers of a local authority have been transferredunder this Act&quot; to bo omitted.     Mr. Ilunro pointed out that there vras a.time limit in respect to State assistance in tho old schemes,but there was no reference to a time limit in thisclause.-   He suggested that some such words as &quot;ifsubmitted within twelve months and completed in twoyears&quot; should bo inserted.   At present Treasury lia-bility was unlimited.   He thought .that tho clauseshould echo the terms of the Circular and was sure thatMr. Stanley Baldwin would be of the same opinion.     nr. Symonds&apos; said that he had consulted &quot;Sir john bradbury and that the Treasury would be content if atime limit appeared in the Regulations.     The Chairman thought that a two years limit might prove a rather short-sighted scheme.   It was desirableto make the authorities look far ahead.     Major Astor said, he had consulted tho treasury and it was not the intention for a time limit to appear in the Bill.   He considered it would be simpler to omit it from the Bill.     The Committee decided that the question should be            referred to the Treasury.     Clause 6  (2) page 4, Mr. Symonds suggested that theword &quot;empowered&quot; would bo a better word for  &quot;liable&quot; in line 22.                              -. .,     The Chairman considered  &quot;liable&quot; to be  tho properword.     Sir Frederick, Liddell pointed out that  the losses were limited to.cases where liability had been under-taken, and that therefore &quot;liable&quot; appeared  to be  the correct&apos; word.     Mr. Symonds said that we should not necessarily .know our liability.
          Tho Committee decided that it was a draft                 point and should ho loft to the                 Draughtsman.     Clause 8, page 5,   This clause to be omitted andto go into the Land Acquisition Bill..     Clause 11, pa ,c 6.   The whole of this clause tobe omitted.     Clause 17, page 9.   llr.. Symonds stated that theTreasury were anxious to secure that, a Public UtilitySociety would not get more than 75 per cent, from&apos; thePublic &apos;.&quot;orks Loan Board, either directly or indirectly.He said that this could be guarded against in theRegulations.   He undertook to consult with theTreasury on the point.     Clause 18, page 10.   Mr. Symonds said that thisclause might have to be re-drafted,   It was under con-sidoration between the Local Government Board and theTreasury.   The principle of paying  something, however,was agreed.     Clause 20, page 11,   The Chairman thought thepolicy of mailing loans to owners seemed ratherquestionable,          ;     Sir Alfred hond was doubtful whether  owners shouldbe lent money to improve their property at the expenseof the State,     Major Astor said that the Local Government Boardsuggested putting this forward as an amending clause.     Ilr, Parker said that the clause would be sure tomeet with fiery criticism in the&apos; House.     The Committee decided to omit  the clause,&apos;     Clause 22, page 13.   Sir,Alfred rlond thought thatthe clause gave very wide powers..     Major Astor said wide powers were necessary tocarry it out and that without these  powers you would
be restricted.)   He asked if this was not the case.     Sir Frederick Liddell said ii was so.     The Chairman considered them Very necessary powers,    &apos; Clause 28, (a), page 16.  The words in square brackets VMI except in cases      remained unexpired&quot;to be de leted.     Clause 28, (b), page 16,  The proviso in square brackets V*t*provided that,,.,to the first purchaser&quot;to be deleted.     Schedules 6* 7 &amp; 8. .  Sir Frederick Liddell pointedout that these Schedules would go out if the LandAcquisition Bill was passed.                  TOWN  PLANNING  BILL,     Sir Frederick Liddell said that the clauses of theTown Planning Bill were to go into the Housing Bill to expedite procedure.     The Chairman read the clauses of the Bill,, whichwere agreed to by the Committee,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.tr,     5th March, 1919e
