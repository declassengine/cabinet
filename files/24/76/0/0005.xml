T.  6905.WAR CABINET.INCREASE  OF  RENT.MEMORANDUM by Sir Edward Bray with reference to theproposals (1) to increase the present rent limit of 35 a year, (2) to extend the duration of the Act,and (3) to allow a landlord to increase the rent.lestion-Considerlether between55 and  55, the andard rent,ight not to bepken as at a ter,date thanpfore the War.  E.B.     I have communicated with and received repliesfrom five of tho London County Court Judges,  namely the Judge of Harylebone nnd West London Courts,  the judge of Wandsworth Court (which includes Richmond),the Judge of Southwark, Greenwich and Woolwich,  the judge of Bow, and the Judge of Shoreditch and White-chapel.  The views of these Judges and myself asJudge of Bloomsbury and Brentford Courts on the  abovethree points are as follows:-(1)     Upon the assumption that it is decided not to       M  so enlarge the scope of the Act as to include  the  general body of lower middle class tenants the  Judges (other than the Judge of Shoreditch and  Whitechapel) consider that it is nevertheless  desir-  able- to raise the rent limit of  35 to  52 or   55  so as to include houses let at a weekly rent of  1  or 21/-.  The alternative rateable value limit  (which is seldom used or useable in practice)  might  he put at  42 to  45, the rateable value being pre-  sumably less than the rent.consider that the duration of the Act should not be                (2)     The Judges  (other than the Judge of Bow)ie date of con-wsion of peace  cesser of ther is, I under-     extended beyond 18 months after the conclusion, oftand, to be fixed7 Parliament.       Peace:   three of the Judges consider that  it should   E.B.

Tho Judge of Bow writes as                follows                          &quot;I  see no probability of any extension                  of housing  accommodation which is at all propor-                  tlonate to  the demand for some years, and I am                  therefore in favour of  extending the Act for at                  least two years from tho present date&quot;.                   The Judges (other than the Judges of Bow and                Shoreditch and Whitechapel) consider that the land-                lord should bo. allowed to increase his rent by 10                to 15 per Cent.  One Judge suggests that it would                be better and simpler instead of naming a percentage                to allow an increase of so nuch In the shilling or                sixpence,say  Id. in 6d. or l d. in the shilling.                    The Judge of Bow writes:-                        &quot;I am not in favour of allowing the landlord                  to raise the rent.  That,in w view, is not the                  proper way  to help him  and I do not think the                  tenants will in future  be in a better position to                  pay an increase than now.  I think the proper way                  to help landlords who are poor and dependent on                  rents is to make them a grant In duly certified                  cases, and  that this grant should be made also in                  cases where, it is clearly proved that the tenantjthor this would be is too poor to pay any  rent.  Sometimes tenants(fable; the sub-    sublet and  to the extent that they are making a                  profit by doing so I think the landlord should be                  allowed to  raise the rent.3 is a questionpolicy and prin-[e on which itlot for me topeas an opinion.

E.B.The Judge of Shoreditch and VJhitechapelwrites :-   &quot;If landlords were allowed t&amp; raise rents bysuggest that ifpresent Act wereaided to only one   statute all will do  so  at once  and there would after Peace,t is to say, 6the from its pre-t date of expiry,&apos;   district are really  very high and always have been,3 provision might   .iropped.       &apos;                     (Sd)   E.
