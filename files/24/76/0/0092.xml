%document is the Property of His-Britannic Majestys Government,]CONFIDENTIAL. [March 5, 1919.]     (11065.)POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT,           FOREIGN OFFICE.                       BELGIUM /002.CAg/^6, i .W    MEMORANDUM          ONBELGIAN AFFAIRS.     BELGIUM during  December and  January has  been in  a state  of nerve-storm,.which is only gradually  subsiding.   When  hostilities ceased the mass of Belgians feltthat now at last the long time of trial was over the exiled would be able to return, theAllies would hasten to fulfil their promises of restoration and all would go happily.  Asthe  reality revealed itself a revulsion  of feeling followed.  Food was scarce and dear,raw materials were lacking, transport was in a state of chaos, workmen refused to work,houses were in ruins and could not be rebuilt.  Everyone grumbled, and the press wasfull of the mutual recriminations of parties and abuse of the Government.Economic Difficulties.     One  great  obstacle  in  the  way of a resumption of business was the break-down oftransport and the destruction of railway-lines and rolling stock, canals, trams, &amp;c.     The Government  was accused of incompetence and lack of initiative, but was ableto point to the difficulties created by the presence of various foreign military authoritieseach claiming control of part of the Belgian railway system.   This primary difficulty ofdivided authority has now been removed a convention having been signed under whichthe  Belgian Government resumes  control  of all  Belgian  railways  as  from  the5th February.   The control is vested in  the Ministry .of War so long as military controlof French railways lasts.  But  the task of the Government is  still a heavy one andcomplaints will  doubtless continue.   It  will be a  long time before communications are properly restored, and meanwhile tariffs have had to be raised..     There is great shortage of certain essential foods, especially of milk and butter, anda strong feeling  of resentment exists against  the farmers who  are accused  of ruthlessprofi tee ling.  Clothes,  boots, and meat are  only to be had at extravagant prices.   Amaximum  price  for butter was fixed by  the Government with the result that butterdisappeared from the market,  and it seems that there has been some smuggling acrossthe frontier into Germany.     Abundant importations could alone remedy the situation, but instead of facilitatingimportation the Government, it was complained, was putting restrictions upon it.   The&quot; Comptoir &quot;national&quot; a  semi-official commission  charged with the purchase  of rawmaterials, implements, &amp;c. is accused of incompetence  and favouritism, and the businessworld is of course impatient to resume control of its own affairs.     Strikes of employees in  the public  services  (post, trams, &amp;c.)  have helped  toincrease  the discomfort and unrest.  During the German occupation refusal to work was a patriotic  action, and  workers who thus refused received support from patrioticfunds.  Now that the hour has come to &quot; demobilise for work &quot; the worker, before giving up his strike pay.  demands  considerable improvement in  his position.   This patrioticstrike pay  has  been  provided during the  war by the &quot; Comite&quot; national&quot; (a  largecommittee of industrialists, leading men of business, controlling large funds) which hasoffered to dissolve, but has been requested by the Government to continue its work.   it comes in for attack from the bourgeois press on the grounds that its relief distributionencourages idleness in the working classes, and so prolongs the stagnation of industry.The Labour and Socialist papers on the other hand  applaud this action and accuseemployers oi seeking to exploit the situation in order to  re-establish the regime of low wages and long hours.  The Belgian working-man,  it appears, thanks to wrhat many ofhis class have seen in England, and  to communications with German rank and file, hascome to realise that the scale of wages in Belgium  has been very far below the  level ofother industrial  casses.   The Labour question is further complicated by demobilisation.     The works in the Belgian black country  round Charleroi which refused to work forthe Germans were  ruthlessly sacked  and their machinery either carried  off to Germany
or used in other establishments for repairs of war material.   The work  of destructionappears to have been done with quite German thoroughness.  In most of these factoriesthe work of clearing the ground has been commenced,  but in the Charleroi basin alonethere is said to be 45,000 men out of work.     The general discontent and disillusionment is reflected in the tone adopted by theBelgian Prime  Minister in giving an account (&quot; La Nation beige,&quot; 17th February) of his conversation with President Wilson in Paris.   He complains  bitterly of the backward-ness  of the  Allies  in coming to  the  relief of  Belgium.  After explaining that  thecancelling of President Wilson&apos;s intended visit to Belgium was due entirely to pressure of work, and that  President Wilson had no need  to go to Belgium  in order to realise the  devastation of the country, M. Delacroix continued : &quot;He is aware also of the unrest created by long waiting for the help so often promised by the Allies which doesnot come.   The United States were able during the war to p rant us credits.....now that peace has come these credits will  no longer be granted  by  the  American Govern-ment.  We are thus deprived of the support on which we had confidently reckoned to rescue us from an  impossible state of things.&quot;   Mr. Wilson, he said, had promised to approach the State treasuries with  a view to obtaining help  for  Belgium ; that promisewould, no doubt, be fulfilled.   He went on to quote from a speech recently delivered in tiie Chamber by the  Minister for Economic  Affairs,  M. Jaspar.  The cry of alarm,he said, uttered by M. Jaspar, ought to be heard  by all the Allies.  All classes of thepopulation were feeling acutely the effects of this  cruel crisis.   It was  not  discontent,not mere impatience, but a profound disillusionment and depression which it had taxedall the energies of the valiant Belgian people to combat.   &quot; To Belgium and the world,&quot;M. Jaspar has  said, &quot;the promise had been given that the  first care of the Allies onthe  termination of hostilities  would  be the restoration of Belgium.....  We havenow  reached  a point  at  which we ask ourselves whether we are  going to be able to exist.  That immediate help, which was to have come to us from all quarters,  we wait for in vain.   Our workshops are  empty, our workers still  idle.  The recovery of thematerial stolen from us is delayed on purely sentimental grounds, and if the Allies donot   at once intervene,  in  particular by granting  us credits  and  advances   on theindemnities which  the Germans will have to pay to Belgium, the ruin of the nationwill be irremediable.  A country which used to import more than 7,000,0001. worth ofraw material requires for the reprovisioning of its shops, the reconstruction of ii s dock-yards, the  re-starting of all  its industrial  system, something very considerable in theway of  help.  We still  hope for it,  for it is our  due.....&apos; Yesterday our  banksyndicate succeeded in obtaining from the American bankers a credit of 250,000,000 fr.(10,000,0001.); in  the  reconstruction  of an  entire  country what  does  such a  sumrepresent ? .  . . .   We know the imperishable bonds which unite us to France, GreatBritain, and the United States, and we hope that the Allies will abandon their original intention of inundating Belgium with manufactured articles.....&quot;      Quite  recently the  situation  has begun to  improve.   Both in this country, inFrance, and in the United States many of the restrictions on export trade to  Belgiumhave been removed.      Mr. Hoover, speaking recently in Brussels (&quot; Informations beiges,&quot; 15th February),expressed himself as follows :           &quot; Let the Belgians be reassured ;  tonnage is improving every day, and that      enables us to go on  improving  and  increasing the  supplies of food.   All  our      available  steamers are on their way to Antwerp twenty are  expected, flying  the      Belgian flag and bringing wheat,  fats, clothes, boots, &amp;c.  There  are no less  than      12,000 to 15,000 tons of clothes, stuffs, &amp;c, on the way.  Iassureyou, and it is      well  that the fact should be known, that  the food situation is improving all over      the world.&quot;      Since  about  the 9th February the Belgian Government  has suppressed import licenses, except those for sugar, cereals, tobacco, wine  and spirits.   Licenses are still maintained  for exports.  At  the  same time  efforts have been made  both by  the Government and private agencies to obtain the  necessary credits abroad.  Government credits  have  been arranged with the  British Government for 9,000,0001. for  purchase of machinery and raw  materials, with  the French Government  for 20,000,000 fr. (800,000Z.), with  the Canadian  for  20,000,0001, and credits are  said to  be being arranged  with the United States Government.  At the same  time a syndicate of London banks and acceptance houses has been formed which is granting a credit of 4,000,0001. to a corresponding group cf  Belgian banks, with the Banque  nationale de Belgique at its  head.
     A similar arrangement for a credit of  0,000,000 dollars has been entered into with the American banks.  To control  the allotment of these credits to Belgian industries, and to guarantee the Belgian banks against loss, the Belgian Government  proposes to establish a national corporation for providing credit  to industry  with a capital of 25,000,000  fr. (50,000 snares of 500 fr.  subscribed by the Banque nationale).  The Association will  be under State control,  the  State guaranteeing  the interest on the shares.  It  will limit its  operations to the revival of  businesses&apos; already in existence which have proved their power of vitality.     Meanwhile, Great Britain and  the  United States  continue to provide tonnage up to  or  above the monthly figure agreed upon between the Allied Maritime Transport Council and the Belgian Relief Commission.  A special  service of  aeroplanes has also been arranged to supply Belgium&apos;s pressing need.   (&quot; Times,&quot; 1st February.)     During the  war the  total number of Belgian refugees in Great Britain is said to have reached in round numbers 250,000.   By October 1918 the number  had  fallen  to about  140,000, many having returned through  Holland or joined their  relations there. Systematic  repatriation began about the 10th  December, became intensified early in January, when the Dover-Ostend route was  reopened, and is now  proceeding through Ostend and Antwerp, several steamers running weekly to  the latter place from ports in north of England and Scotland.   By the end of last week the total number repatriated (apart from those travelling at their own expense)  was about 30,000.    Boats  run  from Dover to Ostend three or four days weekly.  It is hoped that  repatriation will be  com- pleted by the  end of March.  (&quot;  Economist,&quot; 22nd February,  1919 ; &quot; Dailv Chronicle,&quot;.22nd January, 1919.)     The port  of Antwerp is stated to be  in  working order  and progress not very rapid it would appear is being made in the restoration  of railway, telegraph, and telephone services and in repair of waterways.  Competition for Belgian trade is said to be very active-the. French and Americans being particularly  pushing.  There are even indications of attempts to renew German activities. Political Affairs.     All this economic disturbance reacts upon the political situation.  The Government is blamed for everything, and though much of the abuse is ill-grounded, it does appear that few of the  Ministers have  given proof of the initiative and  organising power required for dealing with the extremely difficult and complicated conditions.     The Coalition Ministry, which  replaced that  of M.  Cooreman in  November, is constituted  as follows :          Prime Minister, M. Delacroix (Catholic).         Foreign Affairs, M. Hymans (Liberal). *         Justice, M. Vandervelde (Socialist).*         Interior, M. de Broqueville (Catholic).         War, M. Masson  (Liberal).         Railways, M. Renkin (Cathofic).*         Science  and Art,  M. Harmiquies (Catholic).         Economic Affairs  and Reconstruction, M. Jaspar (Catholic).         Agriculture, M. Ruzette (Catholic).         Industry, Labour, and Reprovisioning, M. Wauters (Socialist).         Public Works, M. Anseele  (Socialist).         Colonies,&apos;M. Franck (Liberal, inclined to Socialism).     The new  Ministry, as  will be seen, is  a coalition, and contains representatives of all  three parties,  six  Catholics,  three  Liberals,  and three  Socialists.  The aim,  as expressed in the King&apos;s Speech, was to conciliate parties and secure national unity. This accounts, perhaps, also  for the selection of representatives of the Catholic party of more or  less new men  with no  political record.  This is true of  M. Delacroix, the Prime Minister, who has no seat  in Parliament and had taken no part in politics, and of the other new Catholic members.  The absence of practical expert elements was noted as strange, in view of the  task which awaited the new Government,  but  this weakness is to some extent removed by the attachment to each Ministry of an advisory Council of experts and professionals.   Eight out of the twelve Ministers are  lawyers.  It soon became clear that  in  point of effectiveness  and possession  of  a definite  political                       * Members of former Government at Le Havre.
 programme &quot;the  Left  wing of the Cabinet altogether out-balanced the Eight, and the Conservative papers reproached the Ministers of the Left for having abused the position conceded to them by favour of the Bight, in  order to upset the national unity, Electoral Reform.      The King&apos;s  Speech, delivered in the Chamber on  the 22nd November, contained a promise of legislation on two pressing questions :  (1) The removal of inequalities in the franchise, and (2) the language question.  The Bill introduced by the Government con- templates the election in May  or June on a basis  of Universal Suffrage of a Constituent Assembly which shall revise the constitution.  Every  man over 21 who can show a six months&apos; residence is to have a  vote.  The measure was from the first  opposed by the Eight in the Chamber ; some objected on constitutional grounds legally no article in the constitution can  be revised except by a Constituent Assembly elected ad hoc and by a two-thirds majority.  The Constituent Assembly would properly be  elected  on the existing suffrage, which gives  a plural  vote  to property, cultural advantages, &amp;c.   To prepare the register for elections on the present complicated system would require, it is said, at least a  year and a half, and the  Government feel that it  would be  both unjust and dangerous to withhold  for  such  a  period  the equality which has  been repeatedly promised during the  war.  The position  of the Catholics in the Chamber depends,largely  on the plural vote, hence their opposition to the Bill.   Another section of the Eight seek to turn the position by demanding female suffrage, counting on the influence of the Church  among the women.  Some employ both weapons.  Thus the Socialists  are driven  into opposing votes for women, although it has figured on their&apos; programme  for  twenty years  past.  Serious divisions are  thus  created which at one time threatened the life of the Government.  Even the Liberals are not altogether  at one  on  the  Universal Suffrage question, arguing that if it  were  established by an ordinary  Act of Parliament it would be liable to be upset at any moment in the same manner.  The Liberals accuse the Eight of opposing the Bill  in the hope of over- throwing  the Government in  which  they  find  themselves  outweighed by the  Left (&quot; Metrop,&quot;  31st January, 1919).  Eventually, however, the Eight decided to support the Government.  In a vote  taken  on the 25th  January [ ? ] in the Sections of the Chamber, 89 voted  for the Bill as it  stood, 26  against, with 23 abstentions.  On the question  of female suffrage the votes were:  62 for, 70 against, and 3 abstentions.   This means  apparently that  the Governments  proposal is sure of a majority, while the question  of votes for women remains open, and is-not likely to endanger their position. The Government have now agreed not to include  female suffrage in their Bill.     The  plural  vote was  attacked in  1913  by  the whole of the Socialist and Liberal parties, and by a section of the Catholics.  The Government, in proposing what no one denies  to  be an unconstitutional procedure, argues  that an extraordinary situation justifies extraordinary measures and that the danger of delay outweighs the danger  of a  reversal.     According to M.  Vandervelde (&quot; Manchester Guardian,&quot; 29th January, 1919), the Labour organisations  of Belgium, which were  powerful  before  the  war, so far  from having suffered, have received a positive stimulus  and are stronger than ever. The Language Question.     The  Flamingants do not  appear  to  have intervened as a party in the debates on electoral reform.   Meanwhile they continue a steady but moderate propaganda for the removal of the disabilities under which,  in practice if not in law, the  Flemish language suffers.   The King&apos;s speech promised in general  that  equality  between the languages should be made a reality and in particular the establishment of something equivalent  to a  Flemish  University at Ghent.   On  the 21st January the University of Ghent reopened under the same conditions in regard to language as existed before the German occupation.   The new  Eector,  Professor Frederick, who,  it-  will be remembered, wa&amp; interned in Germany, deprecates the setting up of a Flemish University as a rival to the existing one.  He is in favour -of a compromise which, while retaining  all the present French courses would appoint Flemish professors in all faculties.  When it  was seen what the real needs for teaching in Flemish were, further steps might be taken. Even before the war thirty-two courses in Flemish existed.   There exists also a Walloon movement which demands a federal regime for Belgium.  The Walloons regard universal suffrage as  a menace ;  they fear that, they will  be swamped by the  Flemings.   Themovement does not appear  to have very great importance.  -*
   Belgium and the Peace Conference.       Belgium had  already nominated three delegates  to  represent her at the Peace   Conference (MM. Hymans, Vandervelde, and Vandenheuvel), when it was made known   that the  small  Powers, among which  Belgium was  included, were only to  he allowed   two delegates each.  Given  the  state of tension and unrest above described, it is not   surprising that  the announcement was received with indignant protests by the wholeIJLJF^ Belgian press, especially as it seems at first  not to have been generally understood  that   decisions would not be  arrived at  by  voting.  It was  an  undeserved humiliation;   Belgium&apos;s heroic resistance was to count for nothing.   The Great Powers were taking   too much upon  themselves in fact, under a League of Nations, the distinction between   great and small Powers had  no justification,   In some quarters it was even suggested   that  Belgium  should withdraw  altogether from the  Conference&apos;(press of .15TH-18TH   January).  But the grievance was soon redressed when Belgium was allowed her third   delegate.  A fresh outcry was raised over representation on the Commissions, on which   five places were assigned to the smaller Powers collectively. The decision of the  smaller   Powers that Belgium should be  represented  on  all  the Commissions  gave great   satisfaction.  &quot; LTndependance beige,&quot; of 31st February, writes :             &quot;The  meeting of the smaller Powers &apos; with particular interests&apos; spontaneously       righted the wrong done by the Great Powers when they limited to five the number       of the representatives  of the whole  body of the secondary Powers on  the Com-       missions of the Conference.   Belgium now has two delegates on the Commission on        War Damages, one  on the League of Nations Commission, and one on the Corn-       mission for Harbours, Rivers and Railways.  Thus Belgium participates actively       in all the labours of the Conference,by  the same title  as  the  Great Powders.  This       event, which means that the other smaller Powers have  made  sacrifices in favour       of Belgium, has made a great impression in diplomatic circles, and gives Belgium a       special position at the Conference.  It  means that those who  are unjustly excluded       from the Commissions trust  the Belgians to  defend the interests of small nations,       knowing well  that they will maintain  the cause of justice and truth.   This is a       proof of the great moral influence obtained  by Belgium during the war.   Matters       appear to be going well for Belgium at the Conference,&quot;   The Belgian Press on Belgian Claims.\       In regard  to  Luxemburg the Belgian press seems  hardly  now to hope for more   than  that  the  Grand  Duchy may not be actually annexed to France, and  that it may!   decide for economic union with Belgium.i       As  to Limburg and the left bank of  the Scheldt, some Walloon organs oppose allj   idea of annexation on the ground that it would still further increase the preponderanceI   of  the Fleming population of Belgium.  The Flemings on  their part are anxious in theI   first place  to maintain amicable relations with Holland.   &quot; The only rapprochement toI   be  desired by  a little  nation like ours,&quot;  said  Van Cauwelaert, at Antwerp, on the3   31st January, &quot; is  a rapprochement with Holland ; and this consideration as well as the   obligation  not to commit an injustice should dominate the  conversations  which we must\   have  with Holland  on  the  subject of certain questions regarding the Scheldt and theI   Meuse.&quot;  The Belgian Socialist party in reply to an appeal addressed to it by the DutchI   Socialists, declared itself opposed to all annexations and in favour of self-determination.I   At the same  time it  was  of opinion that the free navigation of the Scheldt and the\   Meuse ought, under all  circumstances, to be guaranteed to Belgium.  On the whole itj   may  be  said that all shades of opinion, are  agreed on matters affecting the economic   position  of Belgium free  navigation of (Scheldt  and Meuse and  of the  canal which1   connects  Ghent  with  the   Dutch port  of  Terneuzen (south  of Scheldt  in Dutch]   Flanders),  only the Nationalist  papers  press annexationist  claims.   An interestingI  summary of press discussions of the reports of M. Hymans&apos;s statement of Belgium&apos;sI  claims to the  Peace Conference on  the 11TH February  is given  in the Allied  Press\  Supplement (to the W.O. Review of the foreign press) for  the 26th ITebruary.I  Belgian  Socialists.J       Hatred of the Germans is, of course, very strong in Belgium, and is shared by the   Socialists.  This is evidenced by their decision not to take part in the Berne conference it a decision that was opposed  only by a small minority.  As a consequence of this decision1* M. Vandervelde has resigned the presidency of the International Socialist Bureau.
    At the Congress of Belgian Socialists held on  the  25th and 26th  December  a arge  majority approved the participation of Socialists in  the Coalition Government of reconstruction.Demobilisation.    In November M. Delacroix  stated&apos; the  intention  of the Government  to  maintainthe army on a war footing until  peace should  be signed.  The oldest levies were atonce released from service, their  place being taken by the six youngest classes (menborn 1894-1899), who. had been called to  the colours by Royal Decree of November    The total strength of the Belgian army is to be reduced to about 210,000  men.o
