Hence understand  that  all  correspondence concerning State affairs should  be henceforth  submitted to (? group omitted).&apos;     &quot; These iirmans have  been read and shown to all Afghan officials in Peshawar, and are undoubtedly genuine.&quot;     Following account is  derived from letters received  by Afghan Postmaster from relatives in Kabul aud Jalalabad:---     &quot;As soon as Ain ud  Daula Amanulla Khan heard of  amir&apos;s death he sent for Sardar  Abdul Qudus Khan,  Itiniad  ud Daula,  Shall  Gliasi,  Muhammad  Sarwar Khan,   his  grandfather Nairn Khan,  Naib  Salar of Herat,  Ghulam  Baiclar  Khan, Treasury  Officer. Kabul,  and Muhammad  Sarwar,  in  charge of Arsenal.   They consulted for three hours.   Anianulla  then  summoned all civil and military officials to Kabul,  announced  that Habibulla  had  been murdered  by  Nasrulla,  who  had proclaimed himself  Amir.   Nasrulla was  a  traitor, and  Amanulla  would avenge his father.  All present swore  to support him, and  lie raised pay of the troops to Rs. 20 a  month,  promising  to pay  arrears  at  once.   When  Nasrulla  heard  of this  he consulted  Mullas, and a deputation left  for Kabul which included (Jlya, who,  on arrival,  joined  Amanulla.  Amanulla sent message to civil and military authorities at Jalalabad that lie  would  execute  their families  in Kabul unless they arrested murderer.   On this they threatened General Nadir  Khan,  who is supposed to havemade actual arrangements for murder, and  Nadir  Khan is said to have  stated that whatever he did was done  by order  of Nasrulla.   Troops in Jalalabad clamoured for surrender of murderer, and both Nasrulla and Nadir Khan appear to be under some sort  of  arrest  or surveillance.  Mullas are still  been on Nasrulla, but the army  and people have  turned towards Anianulla.&quot;
