                      BEE R.      H *            1VEM0RANDUM BY TK3 POOD CONTROLLER    sk^jif-----m         I am satisfied that the 25$ Increase in the Output       of Beer which was  sanctioned by the War Cabinet on January       24th 1&amp;m,  although providing an improvement^ has no  proved       sufficient to remove one of the chief causes of dissatisfaction       and unrest In the  country,&apos; and I am convinced that a further       Increase must be permitted as soon as possible *           From the  many  complaints I receive, it is evident that       the low quality of the Beer now being sold is almost as  large       a factor in the present unrest as the shortage of supplies *5,          By the recent  increase of 25$ as from 1st January 1919       and&apos;by raising the average gravity 20,  the present barrelage       is *  Standard Barrels                                   Bulk Barrels    1,667,125         Ireland % 10470     n           1,950,000   11,752,875         Great Britain % 1032           20,160,000      750,000      -Wavy  &amp; Army                    Canteen Board   (8 1032            1,290,000    1,120.000            Munition   % 10320           1,920,0.00   15,270,000                                       25,320.000abt. 3/7ths pre war                              a rabies. 5/7ths  pre war,.          I now  suggest  that the War Cabinet should sanction *              (1) An additional 50$ increase on the 1918 Statutory                  Barrelagei              (2) the raising of the average gravity in Ireland                  to 10500J              (3) the raising of the average gravity in Great                  Britain to ld40o.           This Will give f   Standard Barrels                                Bulk Barrels    2,333^970          Ireland    % 1050^          2,567,367   16,426,025        Great Britain % 1040          22,585,784     750,000        Navy &amp; Army                     Canteen Board % 10400          1,031,250    1,3.20^000          Munition    0 10400          1,540.000   20.629.995                                     27.724.401  3/5ths of prewar                             I 3/4ths pre war,-5.         Although  slightly less than, this oVtput^aSproximate to,       the percentage of  the pre war amount of Spirits now permitted       to be released from Bond.5,         The improvement in quality Will remove1 the dissatisfaction       of Brewers in Great Britain because the low average   gravity now       permitted  prevents them from producing Stout In competition       with the Irish Brewers.K         By       proposals the Public will be provided with  a quality       that will  satisfy  them -and -with a bulk quantity which I  am       advised will  go a  long way to meet present demands.
18.          I have reviewed the position as regards supplies         of materials and am advised that there is no reason         io doubt that they -will be forthcomingt 9*          I recommend that these alterations should be         given effect to as from April 1st 1919, and as It is         necessary to give the Trade at least three weeks notice,         I urge that the Cabinet should give Its Sanction not         later than Friday, March 7th,10.          This revision of trade conditions will give the         Brewers enhanced profits and will make It possible or         necessary either for the Chancellor of the         Exchequer to impose higher taxation on the barrelage,         or for me to provide an all-round reduction in the Retail         Price of Beer,    I am of opinion that the latter oourse         is pr^iTerablelit          I therefore ask the Cabinet to consent to an         additional 50$ increase on the 1918 statutory barrelage,         to the raising of the average gravity In Great Britain         and Ireland to 10400 and 10500 respectively, and finally         to inform me if I may reduce the retail prices of Beer         all round (assuming my proposals as to gravity and output         are aocepted) as an alternative to increased taxation on         the barrelage.                                         GEO.  H. ROBERTS,- MINISTRY OF FOOD,        1st March 1919.
