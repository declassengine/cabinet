&apos;M JBfiJbument is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;sGovernment.]February 21st, 1919.CONFIDENTIAL.(11062)POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT,             FOREIGN OFFICE,                      RUSSIA, /021.IMEMORANDUMONTHE PRINKIPO PROPOSAL.Speech by Zinoviev to the Petrograd Soviet on January 27.     COMRADES, you will all be interested in the fact that the Governments  of America, England, France, and Italy, and the other bourgeois Governments, have made a new proposal to Russia.  You all know that already for more than a week the so-called Peace Conference has been sitting in Paris.   At this Conference are assembled  not  the  representatives of peoples,  but the  representatives  of the bourgeoisie, of bankers, and of the robber Governments.  There are assembled there a few representatives of the bourgeoisie of Europe and America under the control  of five men who represent the strongest Imperialist States, America, England, France, Japan, and Italy.  All  the  rest of the representatives  are the  bourgeoisie  of the small, weak countries who play a secondary role and  are put into the shade.   Half- a dozen representatives of the  five chief robber Governments do  everything them- selves ;  the rest of them play the part of dolls.     These  twenty or thirty  Ministers now wish  to  decide  the fate of  the  world. So long as Europe has not yet passed through a revolution they have an opportunity of attempting to  decide  in their own way  the crisis in which both Europe and America are now involved.     The first question which these  robbers occupied  themselves with was the ques- tion of  Russia/  These gentlemen,  the bourgeois Ministers, find that in our country the most terrible  disorder reigns,  and that  it is necessary  as soon as possible  to restore order here..  In those countries in which two bankers speak in the name  of millions of  people there is, in their opinion, perfect,  order, but when  thousands  of representatives of the peasants and workmen assemble in our country in order  to discuss their affairs, that, in the  opinion of these gentlemen, means the  greatest disorder, and it is that which must be put a, stop to as soon as possible.      At the Conference  there is a struggle  between two tendencies.  The  French bourgeoisie intended to send to Russia a large quantity of troops  in order to take us by the throat and make an end immediately of the Russia of the peasants and working men.   The French  bourgeois are extremely discontented with  us,  chiefly because when the  workmen and peasants took the power into their own hands they declared that they would not be responsible for those loans which were concluded1 by Nicholas and his band.     You know that Nicholas borrowed from the French bankers millions of roubles. This money was used in order to conduct a war of plunder, in order to keep a whole army of generals, Black Hundred officers, landowners and other gendarmes.   When we took power into our own hands we said that we did. not make the Revolution in order to pay debts concluded by the Tsar.  We said to the bourgeois of all countries: &quot; Know this: when the peoples are victorious they will refuse to pay the small and the big debts contracted  by their Tsars.   It is your own look-out &quot;if you lent him money.  You ought to have known that the Tsar could not live for long in this world. If you did not realise this, that is your  own look-out.   You will never see your 20 millia/rds again, and you will never get them back.&apos;&apos;     The French bankers  are extremely offended with us because of this, and now, when they have  conquered the Germans and when their hands are free, they wish to send  to Russia a huge army in order to get back these 20 milliards, and at the same time to restore the land to the landowners and to set up a new Tsar over us.    But fortunately their arms  were short. The French workers and peasants say that they do not  intend to  conduict a new war after 4f years merely for1 the purpose of restoring 20 milliards to the bankers.  They say :  &quot;On the contrary, good sirs, we  in Franca too, will soon take from you your last milliards, and will certainly not try to rob the Russian  people.&quot;[1130]-198
      As a result of this the French Government had to recognise the more moderate line of the American President Wilson, which amounted to this: that it was impos- sible to send troops to  Russia.  The bourgeois Governments of France and England tried to send French soldiers to Hungary in order to  crush the Hungarian Revolu- tion, but  the French soldiers began to form there their own Soviets  of  Soldiers&apos;. Deputies  and passed over to the  side of  the  people.  The most cautious of the Imperialists, therefore, are afraid that the same thing will happen in&apos; our country. They tried a month ago to occupy Odessa; there were some thousands of French soldiers there.  To-day, however,  we have just  received a  wireless telegram saying that the French soldiers have left Odessa.  There are no longer any French soldiers left  there, though we do not know the details of how this happened.      The French soldiers left Odessa although the French bourgeoisie sent them not to&apos; have a good time there, but in  order to crush the revolution in the  Ukraine.  If they take  away their soldiers now it is not necessary to be a prophet to foresee that they take them away because the French soldiers have declared that they will not crush the  workmen of Odessa.      If we add to: this the fact that during the last few days we have taken a number of towns Uralsk, Orenburg,  Shenkursk it  becomes clear why these  English and American capitalists are now appffoaching us with peace proposals.      The French bourgeois are warlike because the workmen&apos;s revolution is especially near to them.  The water is mounting to their throats and  they are  prepared to play va banque.      The English and American Imperialists feel themselves  more strongly in the saddle.    They hope to avoid a proletarian  revolution.   They wish  to act more cautiously and  to adopt cunning  tactics.  The  English bourgeoisie is spreading all kinds of gossip.  The  Stockholm  correspondent of the chief organ of  the English bourgeois  reports that  the Bolshevik party has  split.   Lenin, forsooth, has been arrested more than once by us.  At the head  of one part of our party  stands Lenin and  at the head of the opposite  party are supposed to stand Trotski,. Zinoviev, Peters, and Radek.   Lies such as these show that their position is not a healthy one.   The position 0* these gentlemen must be very bad if they relate such Arabian tales to their readers     They  are becoming more and more convinced every day that the sending of their armies to Russia  would mean the training o:f people who to-morrow will turn their bayonets against them.  The French soldiers who have left Odessa when  they return to  Paris will defend us and fight  against their own  bourgeoisie.    Thus nothing is left to these robbers save to attempt now to show  the  fox&apos;s tail instead of the wolfs teeth.   They have turned to us  with an appeal  like that of an arch- priest.  &apos; These gentlemen declare  that their only wish is to help the Russian people, that  they  do not wish to create obstacles to them or to  interfere  in their right to settle their own affairs  in their own way.  The representatives of the Allied Powers treat the Russian people as a friend and not as an enemy, and they whole-heartedly wish to help the Russian people in  that way in which it will be most desired by them. The Allied representatives wish only to find that form of help which  the Russian. people would wish to receive from them in order to strengthen order in their  own country.     They  wish to find a formi of help which the Russian people desire.  Very well, we tell them in a word that the best form of help is for them  to take away their bloody hands and go back to their own country as quickly as possible.  These gentle- men have the impudence to write that the Allied Governments recognise the uncon- ditional right of the  Russian people to settle  their own affairs without any inter- ference or instructions  from outside.    If this is so, then why do they send troops to Archangel, to the Don, and to Siberia, and seize a whole number of towns, support the Czecho-Slovaks,  and-until yesterday keep troops in  Odessa?  They declare, further, that they do  not intend to exploit Russia or to make use of her in any way at  all.  Without the  smallest reserve they recognise the Revolution, and under no circumstances do they wish to make use of any counter-revolutionary  attempt.  It is clear to  everyone that you, sirs, are lying at  every step.  You say you  do not wish to  exploit  Russia, and  yet at the  isame time you seize our  ports arid  towns.  You say you  recognise the Revolution  and  do not  support any counter-revolutionarv attempt; yet you support Kolchak, Dutov, Denikin, and Chaikovski, or are they all revolutionaries, these  gentlemen who shoot down workmen and peasants?
     After more of this sort of  stuff  tiiey then make a practical proposal.  They propose to all the Governments of Russia and, Siberia that they should send their representatives, not more than three men each, to  Prinkipo, in order that there the Allies might settle our quarrels and attempt to reconcile us.  It is always&apos; Govern- ments that they talk about.  The workers and peasants know one Government a Government, as  Karl Liebknecht expressed it,  of  &quot; horny-handed workers  and peasants.&quot;  But  the English and American capitalists consider that  there are at least a dozen Governments.  They recognise any Government of White Guards;  they recognise  the Don Government of Denikin; they recognise the  Crimean Government where a dozen generals have come together and declared themselves an All-Russia Government; they recognise two  whole Governments in Siberia, one Government in Archangel, and a Government  in Ekaterinburg.  They wish  to  bring all these Governments together with our delegates, in order to attempt to reconcile us,in order that we may embrace one another and sympathise  with one  another, as though Denikin, Kolchak, and the other  executioners were our brothers.     But at the moment when our armies are advancing, when we are  taking town-after town, when from day to day we  are clearing oat all the counter-revolutionary nests, at the moment when the European Revolution has gone so far that the English and French cannot  fling their armies  into Russia, the &quot;Allied&quot; gentlemen find it necessary  to help^ Kolchak, Denikin, and Dutov.  And this is why they are resorting to cunning.   They have not got strength enough to crush us, and: have therefore to try by some means or other to draw out our fangs.  They know that our people is exhausted and that it is difficult for us to fight, and  that war demands enormous sacrifices&apos;.   They know the attitude of part of our peasants which was  expressed in. a speech by a peasant woman at the Women&apos;s  Congress.  This  woman said: &quot;We recognise  the Soviet Government, but we are not able to  fight.  Five sons have been taken from me, and I will not agree to fight further.&quot;  But when they asked her, &quot; What will you do if the White Guards come?&quot; she replied, &quot; It will  be as God wills.&quot;       It goes without saying that isolated groups of weary peasants may place their hopes on God; but I presume that Soviet Russia as a whole, the working class which during the last twelve years has passed through two.revolutions, will  say: &quot;Trust in God, but do not  yourselves take any risks.&quot;  It will say  that in any case  the English and American bourgeois do not believe in either God or devil; they believe only in the  strength of the mailed fist.  They understand only  one language,  the language of guns and machine-guns.   For that reason they have begun to wheedle us and to wag their  tail; but we, who do not hope in God so much as in  the sweat of our brow,  have created, under extraordinarily difficult circumstances, a Red Army, weak though it is at present, but yet able to resist them.     Comrades,  the  Allies have formed a plan for now trying  to take advantage of our weariness, for taking advantage of the fact that it is very difficult for us actually to fight at present, and that such fighting demands enormous sacrifices.   They wish to weaken our nerve and to compel us to take them at their word.  Presumably they will pardon us if we cease  forming a Red Army and conclude an armistice with Denikin, Kolchak, and Dutov.     Comrades, now more than ever you must remember the eleventh commandment. &quot;Don&apos;t be caught napping,&quot; and the  twelfth commandment,  &quot;Never trust wolves.. even, if they come in sheep&apos;s clothing.&quot;  .   We wdll never trust those gentlemen who for two years have been supporting by every means in their power the Russian counter-revolution.  Perhaps we shall find it useful to send to  the Devils Island or to Prince&apos;s  Island our representatives, in order that there they may expose  the attempt of the French, Japanese, and American Imperialists to crush their own and our peoples.  If we send our people there &quot;the object will be to compel these gentlemen to take off their masks.  Our delegates will be able to  shown the value of the speeches of the &quot; Allies,&quot; as did our representatives at Brest at the conclusion of the Brest Peace.   As at that time they were able to show the value of  the speeches of  the German diplomats, so now too they will he able to do the same thing towards the French, American, and English Imperialists.  Butnot for a  second will we cease forming our Red Army;  we also will not cease  our advance, which is proving victorious on every front.    The English, Japanese, and  American Imperialists think that  they are verycunning and clever, and that the Russian working class and peasantry and their representatives are so worn out that a few honeyed words to them would make themrepent immediately,  and say: &quot; Let us hold out our hands to them and stop fighting.&quot;
    But  do not  worry yourselves, English, Japanese,  and American Imperialists,We have not what you call diplomats who are specialists in corruption, who are highly expeirt swindlers; we have not got such people, but we do not need them.   Wehave sufficient people with common sense, who understand that we will not thaw atthe first  smile of the American and  Japanese robbers  who find themselves  in a difficult position, and hope, to get out of it by making eyes at us and sending us airykisses.  We do not believe them when they make eyes  at us, and we do not believetheir  airy kisses.  We believe  only in the strength of  common sense  and in thepower of the organised working class  and peasantry.    The  Soviet Government will not lay down its arms at the  present moment, and now,, when the &apos;: Allies &quot; atre beginning to put their tail between their legs, we will increase&apos;our efforts and appeal to our peasantry, and our Red Army and our Fleet,to all the worleers, and we will say to them: &quot; You see the first, fruits of our work! &quot;    A year ago there were many people who did not believe in the course we were taking.   -But now  look!  In Germany already the revolution has  begun, and webelieve that the  workers&apos; revolution will  triumph there.  We were faced with asecond obstacle on the part of the English and French robbers,  but they cannot nowfling&apos; against us their  army, and are compelled to confine themselves to helping theEsthonians and the Finnish White  Guards in the struggle against us.  We must continue  to expose them; we must continue to form our army, to safeguard everyacre of our territory,  and then not even the devil himself will be able to alarm us.0
