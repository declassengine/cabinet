I circulate for the information of the V/ar Cabinet thefollowing brief account of the work of the Board of Tradeduring tne month of February, 1919, which deals only witha few of the more important questions likely to interest my-colleagues and does not profess to be an account of theordinary departmental work of the Board, or to include allthe important questions considered by tne Department.AX  STANLEY./4&apos;niarch,  1919,COimm AND INDUSTRYm              The Haw Cotton Order,  1917 and the Cotton (Restriction         of Output)  Order,  1918,  which restricted the use of raw         cotton and  the employment of.machinery, have been cancelled         as from February 3rd,  1919,              The temporary general licences for a number of manu-         factured articles&quot; on the prohibited list which were issued         on the signature of the  Armistice were withdrawn on 1st         March and their place  is taken by a system of licensing which.         will serve  temporarily to enable&apos; control to be maintained         and at the  same time to  secure a sufficiency of essential       .  imports.              Certain special concessions to Italy and Japan in-         volving free licensing have also been withdrawn/ but the         control assumed, has only been nominal, the licensing ex-         tending to  10Q% of 1916&quot; imports..          *              During February the Board of Trade issued General         Licences authorising the resumption of trade with&apos; the         territories on the left  Bank or the Rhine, Czecho-Slovakiar-..

There were nearly 150 more firms taking part thisyear than in 1918, ana all exhibitors have expressed  tham-selves satisfied with the business they are doing. lorethan 150 buyers from overseas countries have  alreadyvisited the Fair, and many of them are placing orders.     This question has been discussed with representativesof  the French Government and it was ascertained that theFrench were prepared at our request to quote favourableBailway Hates on Italian food products passing in smcriiiedquantifies to this country.  The question of mroughrates on articles exoorted from this country to Italyby the same route is&quot;under discussion with the railway executive Committee,     With reference to the working of the existing ChannelFerry Boats as a commercial service, the Channel FerryCompany have asked uoon what terms the Government will rbe prepared to sell or charter to them these beats,  it .being their intention to transfer them :c &quot;:;ev .^nand start a goods service between that port a j d Dieppe,The War Office have informed us,  however, that the vessels in question are likely to be required for ?*:ar Demrtmentservices for some months, so.that the Ooiapanyfsapplication cannot at present be  entertained.TMAL          German7 having decided some time ago to adoptOff ffOOPS   a brake of her own for goods trains,  the  French have           nowproposed a Conference with a  view  to Liposing on           her the use of a brake suitable  for general interna-           tional use. and have invited Great Britain to  be           represented on that Conference.   It lias been decided           to accept the invitation and the Railway  Executive           Committee have been asked to submit the names  of &apos;           two or three delegates.
POBIIO snandss mmmmwxi.m     Negotiations between the Hallway ExecutiveOommitiee and representatives of the National Union   -of Kallwaymen and the Associated Society of          ;  ...Locomotive Engineers and Piromen in regard to thequestion of conditions of service of railwayman,have been proceeding.   I attended tiie first of the  .meetings and I hope that in view of the progress thathas been made an agreement may be arrived ai with theUnions.  !Ehe questions raised, however, which includematters such as the conversion of war wages intopermanent&apos; wages, standardisation of conditions ofservioe for tne various classes of employees, represeni-ation of railwaymen as regards the control of railways,and&apos;other important matters&apos;involve very difficult and far-reaching considerations.PAPER CONTROL.&apos;MtMm      The  anounts paid  into  the &quot;Controller^ account during February total   392,256.18. 0 comparing with&quot;  397,035.13.3 for January and  617,980 for December.      It has been decided that  the paper control is to be removed at the end  of April next.  In the mean- while  licences will be granted for paper an,d paper making materials to&apos; be * imported up to&apos;a 75$ ration of the pre-war imports.  In view of this large additional ration the c*uestion whether steps can be taken to minimise  the&apos; loss to those who hold stocks and to&apos; get : business going again is being considered.   The News- print Makers nave also&apos; been invited to meet the Controller to discuss with him the question of an agreed price of paper until the Control has been abolished.     Iflhatever may be arranged as regards prices and stocks;- a number of Mills have closed down already and more will inevitably&apos; close in the near future owing to their  inability to compete in price with imported  ; goods.  Orders Hate been scarce in the Printing -Mills.&apos; as opposed to the Newsprint Mills, and the fall in prifn which the large increase in imports will involve is another serious difficulty;  and may;  it is feared; leaa tc5  unemployment and to inability on the part of the hills to employ Soldiers returning from the Colours.
GOAL OONTHOL.     The Department,has suffixed a-very severe loss in the unexpected death of Sir Guy Oalthrop on February23rd, which took place from pneumonia foHwing influenza^There can be no doubt that his health had been affectedby the severe and continuous strain of his duties asController of Coal Mines.     Sir fiuy Calthrop was appointed Controller earlyin 1917. ana amonj the many&apos; great problems that he had UAcope with during  ,he last two years were tlia arrac-gnmnxsfor compensating the coal owners, which were emb-ciied inthe Coal Minos Agreement (Confirmation) Act  the re-organisation of the inland transport of coal by rail,themaintenance of the supply of coal in 1918, including theprovisioning of the Allies  in the very difficult situa-tion created by the recruitment of the miners, which necessitated the introduction of domestic rationing ofooal in this coisntry. The labour position was one thatgave rise to constant anxiety throughout the whole period.     Sir Guy was created a baronet at the beginning oflast year in recognition ox his services. As controller of Ooal Mines he earned tho confidence and esteem of  &apos;both the mine,owners and the miners. All who came into contact with him will appreciate that the loss of hispersonality especially at the present juncture is nothing less than a calamity.     The following statement shows the progress of thearrangements for increasing emergency stocks of coal inthis country;-          The balance of the quantity of 115,760 tons     was distributed to house depots.          The Admiralty have also accumulated additional,     stocks of 62,140 tons at various depots.     The output of coal has shown an appreciable im-provement since the beginning of February, the weeklyfigures since the beginning of tho year being asfollows:^     Total quantity of coal spec!three week a ending 8th March ....

TIMBBB COITOOL,     The Controller of Timber Supplies has been appointedController of Surplus Timber under the Surplus PropertyDisposal Board of the Ministry of Munitions.   The  Stocksheld by the Department will be regarded as surplus anddisposed of to1the Trade.     A Notice has been issued announcing that the  controlof imported softwoods will be removed at the  end of March.     The control of imported hardwoods having been removed from 1st March,  the only remaining element of control after31st March will be the pitwood Order 1918 as  amc^dr&apos;,-which fixes maximum prices for Pitwood and areas out&apos;ofwhich Pitwood may not be moved without permission,&apos;     The licensing Subcommittee of the Trade and  LicensingCommittee has been appointed in accordance with the  oroce-dure laid down in White Paper No. Od. 9194 for the purposeof dealing with all questions relating to the import ofdyestuffs.  Initial meetings of the Sub-Committee  have  beenheld, and the organisation which will be necessary forcarrying out its Executive work is be ing established.-     A Proclamation was issued on the 24th February, 1919 -prohibiting the import from all countries of synthetic dye-stuffs and intermediate coal tar products together with  1certain other goods which for the purposes of the  orohibi-tion are to be regarded as synthetic dyesiuffs.     In order that the machinery for dealing with  importsmay be set up a general lioence has been given for the im-port of all products covered by the prohibition  which areof American, French or Swiss origin. This licence  is merelya temporary measure, and will probably remain in force for about a month.&apos;
