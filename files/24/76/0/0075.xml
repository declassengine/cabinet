The National Industrial Conference of the 27th  February emphasized  once  again the fundamental difficulty with which any Government is faced in dealing with industrial disputes.  The responsibility for finding a settlement is placed by the public and pressupon the Government.  In  truth,  except of course where the industry is State owned or controlled, it  rests,  and in the first instance can rest, only on the representative organisations of employers and workpeople directly concerned.  Government interventionmust wait on their action ;  however urgent the need,  it is difficult for the Governmentto go behind them; yet their  failure to effect a settlement very seriously prejudices theprospects of successful  Government action.  This difficulty was obscured during thewar although it  remained a real difficulty by the powers of enquiry and intervention of the Ministry of Munitions under the Munitions of War Acts.  Yet the Whitley Committee,specifically appointed to  provide  the  Government with  a  Reconstruction policy  on industrial Relations, was  only able to  recommend that the Government  itself should do no more than &quot; propose &quot; the formation of Industrial Councils, offer to be represented(0 1705) 140  8/19  H &amp; S
 &quot; in an advisory capacity at the preliminary meetings,&quot; and undertake to supply informa- tion.   The experienced officials of Trade Unions  and Employers&apos;  Associations on the Whitley Committees could devise no policy that the Government itself should carry out.     A policy of leaving industrial differences to voluntary industrial associations is no doubt the ideal, but it requires a  completeness and perfection of  organisation in these associations which  they do not exhibit and which results in constant failures to effect settlements.   The imperfections of organisation for this purpose are found principally among the Trade Unions, and have hampered  and delayed  the establishment  of  Joint Industrial Councils,   They may be considered under three heads.  t     The existence of competing and overlapping unions in  the same industry leads to jealousy and  recrimination, which in turn prevent co-operation for ends affecting the whole industry.   This cause is one great  obstacle to the establishment of an Industrial Council for Engineering, and, what is of even greater immediate importance, prevents the establish- ment of Works Committees on a trade-union basis to  deal with purely local grievances. The problem of craft unions with members in different industries can be solved, and has been  solved  in several Councils, by giving representation on  an  industrial  council to representatives of various  craft and general labour unions;  one of the chief services of the Whitley scheme indeed is that it offers a workable compromise between trade unionism based exclusively  on the  craft or occupation  of  the  worker and trade unionism based exclusively on the industry in which he happens to pursue that craft or occupation.     The second imperfection is one that  has been much in prominence during the war, and has been referred to before, namely, the relation of the national executive to the rank  and  file.  The official spokesmen of a union for the time being may be out of touch with  their constituents.  Whatever may be said of the individual employer, the Govern- ment at any  rate cannot go behind the backs  of the official union representatives, yet agreements accepted by them may be dishonoured by  the rank and file.   As has already been  said, this point raises a problem which the Government have no means of solving, .and can only render less  acute by encouraging by every means possible efficient Trade Union machinery and representative arrangements.  The dispersal of a union&apos;s authority ^between a directly elected  executive Council, a directly elected general secretary, directly elected district authorities, and directly elected district  officials as in  the case of the A.S.E.-would seem to lead to confusion and indecision, without securing the fully represen- tative action that normally characterises the governing  bodies of  the Cotton organisations.&apos; In the latter the authority of a single council is -made clear, and it is found possible to include in such councils persons still working at their trade. &apos;     A third difficulty arises from the relation of the union organisation to the individual works.  The  difficulties of large engineering employers (or employers&apos; association) arise largely from the fact that they have normally to deal with over twenty unions, not one of which probably has  branches  that coincide with works.  The Shop Steward movement, although it has provided agitators with a platform, would seem to  be in the main a perfectly legitimate movement to alter the domestic constitutional arrangements of certain unions -and make the works, rather than  the locality,  the unit of organisation.&apos; The value of Works Committees where they can be established is that while they must necessarily be established in close relationship  Avith the trade unions, they  bring together the work- people in  a given works irrespective of trade union membership, and are able to &quot; short circuit &quot; a large number of minor grievances, which, if put through the cumbrous machinery of ordinary trade  union procedure, might be delayed until  they developed into major grievances.     As has been said, these are problems for the trade unions themselves, and,  so far as outside intervention is  of any use, for the National Industrial Conference Committee rather than for any Government Department, but even in connection with these matters the Ministry  of Labour has already been  able  to find a considerable sphere of indirect usefulness.  By investigating  the  existing organisation of industries, and by assistance of a  mediatory and secretarial character, it has  been able  to  bring together on  Joint Industrial Councils  many associations that had  never co-operated before.  The same assistance, of course, is also available in the formation of Works Committees, where the parties concerned are amenable. Without such assistance it seems as if the establishment of Works  Committees will  proceed  slowly.  Yet no constitutional device would be likely; to do  more to discharge industrial ill-feeling; for a properly constituted Works Committee, acting within lines agreed  on by the unions concerned, will not  only settle as they arise countless little grievances that at present  are allowed to grow and rankle, but would also satisfy in  a practical way  the claim to a greater immediate  control over the conditions of their working life that is at present agitating the idealists among the working classes.
                   PAET II-DEMOBILISATION, AND RESETTLEMENT. Port Labour.    Among the special problems involved in demobilisation, one which presented peculiar difficulties was the question  of Port Labour.  In the first place, the application of the Government scheme for out-of-work donation required exceptional treatment owing to the casual nature of port labour and its frequent transfer from  one employer to another. Moreover, it was feared that during the period of unemployment following on the armistice casual labourers of all sorts would tend to resort to the docks as familiar centres for casual and irregular employment.  There was a risk that on demobilisation the transport worker woulcj, find his employment flooded by labour from other sources, and that in consequence his work would become  even more casual and intermittent than before the war.  The Ministry of Labour had, therefore, to take appropriate steps to meet both these difficulties  to provide an effective system for the administration of out-of-work donation, and to decasualise port labour so far as possible.    In this process, use  has been made of the Port Labour Committees formed early in the war to deal with the recruitment and exemption of transport workers.  Soon after the armistice the committees were reconstituted, to deal in the  first place with the release of pivotal men from the colours, and also to make special arrangements for out-of-work donation  and to consider schemes for decasualisation.  To co-ordinate the work of these local committees, a Central Advisory (Port Labour) Committee was appointed, representing; the employers and the trade unions chiefly concerned with transport work.*    As regards the application of out-of-work donation, a model scheme has been forwarded to all Port Labour Committees to be used in each case as a basis in elaborating a scheme adapted to meet local conditions.  Many of the Port Labour Committees were already engaged on the preparation of independent schemes.  The general result of the delibera- tions of the committees has been satisfactory. Schemes, following in the main the outlines of the model scheme, have  been prepared in sixteen of the chief ports.  The essential features of these schemes may be summarised briefly as follows  :     Applicants  for out-of-work donation  policies,  who  state that they  are transport         workers, will not be registered as such unless  they  are  certified as transport         workers by the Port Labour Committee.    Proof must be furnished that the applicant is not employed, and is willing to accept        employment.    This  proof can be obtained quickly and easily in ports where a registration scheme        and a system of surplus stands or clearing houses for unemployed labour is in         existence.    In other ports it is proposed to introduce an emergency system of surplus stands or        their equivalent, in close communication with the taking-on stations. At these         surplus stands a man desiring to obtain out-of-work donation would be required        to attend after each call for  labour.  Evidence would thus be provided day by        day that the man had attempted without success to obtain work.    For the guidance of  the Employment Exchanges, the Port Labour Committees may draw up lists  of occupations suitable for transport workers, and will be.free to submit observations to the Courts of Referees on any disputed claim for unemployment donation.    These schemes for  out-of-work donation, as they stand, adapt themselves to  the introduction of the system of registration which is essential to any scheme for the decasua- isation  of port labour.   For  this purpose, however, fuller arrangements  are necessary. These  are outlined in a model scheme prepared  by the Central  Advisory  (Port Labour) Committee.  Local Committees have been asked to adapt this scheme  to the ports with which  they are concerned.  It is based upon systems of registration already in existence. In a few cases (as at Liverpool) the systems were in operation before the war, and in othersthey were introduced during the war in connection with exemption from military service.    Under the model scheme,  men recognised by the Port Labour Committee as bonafide        transport workers will  be registered  by the Committee, and receive a  metal        tally  or other token bearing the registration number which must be produced,        if required, on engagement.    In order to safeguard the employment of transport workers on military service, regis-        tration will, in the first instance, be confined to  men who were employed in the        port on the first day of the  war.  A  further issue of tallies may afterwards be        made to men employed at later dates if the chances of employment  of the bona    * For the Port of London a special Committee of Inquiry was set up under Mr. Justice  Roche, to prepareschemes adapted to the special conditions of the port.    (C 1705)                                                               A  2
           e transport workers are not thereby prejudiced.  In order, however, to meet        occasions calling for a greater number of workers than are registered, the Secretary        of the Port Labour Committee may sanction the issue of temporary employment        tickets available for a week.    The Port Labour Committee may cancel the registration of workers in cases of serious        misbehaviour or failure to work, after careful inquiry and report by the principals        of the firm concerned.    Proposals on these lines have, in general, been well received, and in most of the chiefports the committees have already produced  their proposals.  Schemes have alreadybeen brought into operation at Aberdeen, Cardiff, Grimsby, Hull, Leeds, Liverpool, New-port,  Southampton,  Sunderland,  and  Swansea.  Perhaps the  most important deviationfrom the lines of the model scheme arises in ports  where the transport workers&apos; unions are strong, in which case there is a tendency to  propose that the registration system shallbe placed in union hands.    It is necessary to emphasise the fact that, as regards these schemes for decasualisation,the work now being done depends on voluntary agreement.  The Port Labour committees have no statutory authority to this end, and schemes at present being  introduced  can therefore be enforced only where all employers in the port are in agreement.  In some cases it seems probable that no voluntary scheme will be  accepted, and that further authority will be needed if the policy of the Ministry is to be carried out completely.                            PART  III. PRESS COMMENTS.                          (1) The  Labour arid Socialist Press.                                (a) Peace Conference. The League of Nations.     A few of the Labour papers  continue to comment on the draft scheme for a League of Nations.   &quot; The Paris Peace Muddle,&quot; says  &quot; Justice,&quot;  is chiefly due to  the action of President Wilson,  who will persist  in piling up long  discussions on  the ideal League of Nations, while the actual situation is getting more desperate every  day.   The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; thinks  that the opposition  which President Wilson has had to face in Washington will undoubtedly weaken his hands on his return to Paris.  Again the fault is said to be entirely his own, apparently for the reason that he was unable to get his own draft scheme accepted at the Conference.  The &quot;  Herald &quot; complains that the Conference  is not making much progress in the larger matters.  It has not yet broached the question of the Rhine, it has  avoided the Jugo-Slav Frontier problem, and is certainly a long way from solving the -Russian  problem.   The world,  meanwhile, is  getting&apos; desperately  impatient.   This paper also prints a letter from Lord Eustace Percy, who criticises the attitude taken up by the &quot; Herald&apos;s &quot; editorial article two weeks ago.  He thinks that it carries a spirit of suspicion and prejudice, it criticises not the provisions on the face of the document but the inten- tions which are thought to lie behind it.  In answer-the &quot; Herald &quot; adheres  to its original view, and persists  in the opinion that there are few signs of  any change in the ideals of Continental diplomats.   These are still thinking the thoughts of the nineteenth  century, and without a change in their attitude no League constitution can be much more than a paper mask for the old Concert  of Europe.Paris Labour  Commission.     The &quot; Herald  &apos;7  considers that  the chief event of last week&apos;s peace-making wras theannouncement that the Labour  Commission was almost at an end.  If the British draft has been accepted  with little alteration, this should be a red-letter  week in  the history ofLabour.   The &quot;  Labour Leader &quot; adds, however, that it is too  much to hope  that countrieslike Japan and India would be ready to take the tremendous  step of raising their factorylegislation  to the relatively high standard laid down&apos; by the Commission. D   -                           (b) foreign  Affairs. Kussia.     The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; publishes a long article by Herbert Bryan on the &quot; Press and the Bolsheviks,&quot; in which he alleged that much of the information published in the pressis false or grossly exaggerated.   The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; declares that our armies in Russia are  being used on the side of the Capitalists, Landlords and Czarists, and the &quot; Call&quot; urges that it is the duty of the Labour Party to make  further war on Russiaimpossible.
  Starving Europe.      Several papers bitterly condemn  the  continued  blockade of  the Central  Powers.  According to the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; the worst crime of the war is  the starvation of the  civil population of Central Europe.  This policy is makingdt impossible for any constitu-&apos;  tional Government in Germany to retain authority, and it will leave a legacy of hate, and  make impossible an early reconciliation of peoples.   The &quot; Call &quot; marvels that those who  are responsible for the death of 750,000 babies and women in Germany through the blockade  have the temerity to profess horror because the Soviets have decided that those who per-  form no useful work shall receive less food than those who do.  The &quot; Herald &quot; again appeals  for the  raising of the blockade.   It remarks that France,  Italy and even Belgium are  apparently seeking vengeance instead  of peace,  and the spread of famine  and disease in  Europe  is the direct result of the use the victors have made of their  victory.                                   (c)  Home Affairs.  National Industrial Conference.      The Industrial Conference held at Westminster on the &apos;27th February receives much  attention in the Labour press.  It is apparently the policy of most of the papers to speak  of it in  a derogatory manner.  &quot; Justice &quot;  thinks that from a Socialist point  of view the  discussion was not encouraging.  Mr. J. H. Thomas made the most collectivist contribu-  tion to it by his declaration in favour of State control for mines and transport.   The paper  asks, if the Triple Alliance has got so far on the road to collectivism, why does it not declare  also for  the nationalisation of other monopolies ?   The &quot; Call &quot; and  the &quot; Herald &quot;  are of  opinion  that the Conference  was  merely intended as a side-show to divert attention from  the pressing claims of the miners and other bodies  of workmen, and to give the  Govern-  ment time.  The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; looks  upon it as providing an excellent opportunity  for Labour to tell the employers what  they want, but as an  instrument to allay unrest it  was little more than a solemn farce.  Incidentally,  however, it revealed the fact, already  widely suspected, that the Government has no industrial policy which it can safely make  public at an open conference of both sides.  &quot; Forward,&quot; voicing a  Scotch point  of view,  remarks that no one at the Conference mentioned the absurdity of such a Conference trying  to find a basis of harmony while Shinwell, Gallacher, Kirkwoodj and others are awaiting trial  in Glasgow on charges arising out of the unrest which the members of the Conference are  seeking  to analyse.  It suggests that in place of the Conference the Government should  have instituted a public inquiry into the Glasgow strike.  In the eyes of the &quot; Workers&apos;  Dreadnought&quot; the Conference exposed those  one-time Labour Leaders who have appar-  ently forgotten any class solidarity they may have possessed.  The  &quot; Clarion &quot; alone was  appreciative, and thought the tone of the Conference impressively earnest and thoughtful.      The Labour Ministers announcement of the reduced Unemployment Donation is not  allowed  to  pass  uncriticised.  According to the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; and the  &quot; Workers&apos;  Dreadnought,&quot; Labour demands  something drastic in  fulfilment of  the Prime Ministers  pledge of a new era, and the Labour Minister offers a reduced unemployment dole.   The  &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; adds that the Government will not maintain the Unemployment  Donation at its present level, although it can afford to go on spending over  60,000,000 a  year on furnishing profits to railway directors.  The reason for the  reduction in the  Un-  employment Donation is alleged in the &quot; Herald &quot; to be obvious, namely, that the capitalist  system can only be kept going by the existence of a large margin of unemployed labour,  to be used to smash strikes and keep down wages.   In &quot; Justice &quot; the Labour Minister is . said to  have made an admirable summary of the difficulties which it is  impossible for  capitalism to solve.      The &quot; Herald &quot; and the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; emphasise the fact that the representatives  came with no mandates from their various organisations, and, therefore, whatever may be  decided  by the Joint Committees or any further conference will be quite worthless until the  members of the various organisations have considered aud voted upon them.  &quot; Forward &quot;  asks: &quot; Are the employers agreed to  assist in the change over to democratic control of  industry ?  If they are not, then  the Conference can at best only temporarily allay unrest,  and the process will have to be gone through again at some later period.&quot; The &quot; Workers&apos;  Dreadnought&quot; refuses to believe that the employers can adopt any reasonable  point of  view,  and therefore considers that Labour&apos;s participation in  the Joint Committees  will  merely postpone the day of its emancipation.  Unbiassed judgment on such  committees  will be an impossibility, as the  Chairman, it is assumed, will be drawn from the employing  class.   The Labour papers apparently believe nationalisation to be  the only solution for  the present unrest.  The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; and  the &quot;Herald&quot;   maintain  that both  statesmen and trade union leaders must face the fact that we are reaching the end of the      (C  1705)                                                               A 3
Capitalist era, and they must formulate their plans accordingly.  The whole  system ofindustry must be revolutionised, and nothing less than this will settle the Labour unrest.The &quot; Herald,&quot; however, suggests that the Joint Committees might at least insist upon theGovernment immediately passing an Eight Hours Act for all trades, with the right for any trade to secure a shorter day if it can, and also insist upon a shorter day for the Govern-menfs  own employees to serve as an example.Miners&apos; Demands.    The Coal Commission receives less hostile criticism than does the National industrial conference.  In the &quot; Call&quot; and the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; however, the miners areblamed for consenting to an Inquiry. John Maclean, writing in the &quot; Call,&quot; implies that Mr.Brace and other miners&apos; representatives have been influenced by Government agents intobelieving that Bolshevists are responsible for the attitude of the miners, and therefore theyare favouring a Commission in order to defer a strike which they hope will never come off.Thus the miners&apos; leaders will fail for fear of revolution.  The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot;considers that in consequence of the method of representation (1)  the socialist element,which provides the driving  force in mining centres, will be far from satisfied, for evenRobert  Smillie does not fully represent the younger revolutionary element; (2) the minerswill find themselves either outvoted or manoeuvred into a false position at the Conference.The &quot; Herald,&quot; on the other hand, thinks that the miners have chosen their representativeswell.  It  anticipates, however, that the other side  will try  to side-track the  report.&quot; Already they have attempted to stave off nationalisation by getting the miners to acceptthe&apos;Whitley Scheme, and join with them in fleecing the public.&quot;  Nationalisation is desired by all the papers.  The &quot; Labour Leader &quot;  thinks it is a pity that the two questions ofwages and hours and of nationalisation  should not be considered concurrently, since it isdoubtful whether a satisfactory report on wages and hours can  be produced on a basis ofprivate ownership of the  mines.  &quot; Forward &quot; considers cheap coal to be so important that the Government should be compelled to stop the payment of royalties.   If a strike is justified for wages, it is even more justified in order to compel the Government to pay thewages out of the right pockets.  &quot; Justice &quot; suspects that the Government is really onthe side of the mineowners, for it alleges that within the last four or five years the profiteerhas been guarded and fed with public  money by  our so-called &quot; Controllers &quot; of  public services.   &quot; If it was known to what extent Government Departments had supported theprofiteers we should discover that in every  recent industrial crisis, the miners&apos; included,the Government has been on the side of the profiteers against producers and the mass ofthe people.Nationalisation of Industry.     Sir Leo Chiozza Money writes long articles in the &quot; Herald &quot; and the &quot; Labour Leader &quot;in favour of nationalisation.   In the course of the former article  he  mentions that sir robert Home, in his reference to National  Factories, frankly abandoned the  well-worncontentions against socialism,  and did  not  pretend that State works are not successful.He alleges that the  war has disposed of the story that the State  cannot run industrial undertakings.Parliamentary Labour  Party.     The &quot; Labour Leader  &quot; and the &quot; Herald &quot; emphasise the fact that if the parliamentary labour Party is to make good its claim to be a National Party, it will have to take an interest in other than industrial questions, and especially to insist that justice is not omitted from the peace  settlement.   It falls to  the duty of the Labour Party, therefore, to insist upon the House of Commons expressing its  views upon  the draft scheme of the League. The &quot; Herald &quot; suggests that the Government is perfectly aware of the pressure of domesticproblems upon the time of  the Labour Members, and hopes that Labour&apos;s hands are toofull to  allow it to interfere with international politics. Conscription.     The new plans for the  Army receive much criticism, and  evil times for the workers are prophesied as a result of them.  Thus,  according to the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; and the  &quot; Call&quot; there is no mistake about the fact that the  1919-20 Army estimates are being raised- to  fight  socialism.   The  &quot; Labour  Leader&quot;  and  the  &quot; Herald&quot;believe  that  the proposals  continue  conscription.  The &quot; Herald&quot;  enlarges on thispoint, and adds that although DO powers are given to enlist compulsorily any more men,those powers already exist under the Military Service Acts of 1916-1918, and these remainin operation for the period of the war.   Those who are at present too young may be drawn
 into the military machinery in one.of the following ways : either a scare of national emer- gency will be worked up at the appropriate moment, so that the Acts will be continued until eventually they pass into the list of measures re-enacted every year, or compulsory military training will be included in the curriculum of the compulsory Elementary Schools. The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; and the &quot; Call &quot; point out that the war which was for the  declared purpose of destroying militarism will leave us with the burden of a  far larger standing Army than was maintained by France  or Germany in 1914.  The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; continues that Mr. Churchill spoke truly when he pointed out that the present strength of the Army must be determined  by policy ;  if such terms as are foreshadowed from Paris are to be  inxposed upon Germany, then conscription is certainly the logical and inevitable consequence.                (2) The Daily Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.     The announcement of  the  extension of out-of-work donation at reduced  rates  has passed almost without comment in the daily press.  In other directions there is little to record.     Doctors and Nurses. The  &quot; Manchester Guardian &quot; (5th March) is of opinion that the  facts  revealed by Mr.  ChurchilPs  statement  on the number  of doctors and  nursesdemobilised since the armistice &quot; reflect heavily upon the competence of the authorities.&quot;     Canadian Soldiers&apos;  Demonstration. Discussing the outbreak  among the canadian troops near Bhyl the &quot; Westminster Gazette &quot; (7th March) writes :     &quot; The discontent must surely have been known to the authorities before the disturb-        ance, and the publication beforehand of the information which was forthcoming        afterwards would have prevented the disaster.&quot;     Agricultural Labour. The &quot; Western Daily News &quot; states that, in reply to grievancesput forward by the Somerset Farmers&apos; Union, Sir Henry Boscawen, Parliamentary Secre-tary of the Board of Agriculture, has replied  that labour difficulties are due to  the comparative  slowness with which pivotal  men are being returned to agriculture.  TheWar Office is  being pressed to expedite their release.                PART IV.-GENERAL TOPICS AND DISTRICT REPORTS.                                     (1) General. Negotiations proceeding.     The Coal Mines Commission held its first meeting on the 4th March.   The enquiry is still proceeding.  The negotiations relating to the Railwaymen&apos;s national programme continue.     Natioml Transport Workers&apos; Federation. According to statements made at a special General Council of the Transport Workers&apos; Federation held on the 10th March at Westminster, it appears that satisfactory progress is being made in-the  negotiations proceeding.  In the  case  of  the  tramway employees  a joint recommendation has  been arrived at which is  likely  to prove the basis of a settlement.  Resolutions were passed  at. the meeting  to the effect (1) that this official council, being satisfied with  the  reports, empowers the Executive Council to proceed with the negotiations ;  (2) that this conference &quot; protests  against the establishment of  a  bureaucratic control of transport under the Transport Bill and demands that the powers of the proposed Minister shall be vested in a Board of Communications, composed of equal numbers  of  representatives  of the State and of the Unions catering for transport work.&quot;    In accordance with the conditions on which the boilermakers, blacksmiths and  ship- wrights resumed work in the North-East Coast shipyards, a joint conference of employers and trade unions concerned was held in London on the 5th March to consider the question of piece and lieu rates, this subject being regarded as the chief cause of  the  eight weeks&apos; strike.  No agreement could be reached and the case is to go to arbitration.    Joint Industrial Committee. The  first meeting  of the Provisional Joint Committee of employers&apos; and  workers&apos; representatives, set up by the National Industrial Conference on the 27th February, was held at Westminster on the 4th March.  Sir Thomas Munro,K.B.E., was appointed Chairman and Mr. C. S. Hurst of the Ministry of Labour, Secretary
of the Committee.  The Committee proceeded to consider the subjects of their enquiry and the methods of procedure.  After a full discussion and on a report of a sub-committeethe following resolution, moved by Sir  Allan Smith and seconded by Mr. Arthur Henderson,was unanimously agreed to :     &quot; That this committee, in order, that its work may be accomplished as expeditiously        and  thoroughly as possible, divide itself into  three sub-committees, with the        following terms of reference :                               &quot; Sub-Committee No. 1.        &quot; To make recommendations concerning :           &quot; (a)  The method of negotiation between employers and trade unions, including                the  establishment of a permanent Industrial  Council to  advise the                Government  on industrial and  economic questions with  a  view to                maintaining industrial peace.          &quot; (b)  The methods of dealing with war advances, and          &quot; (c) the methods  of  regulating wages for all classes of workers, male and                female, by legal enactment or otherwise.                              &quot; Sub-Committee No. 2.        &quot; To make recommendations as to the desirability of legislation for a maximum**  number of working hours and a minimum rate of  wages per week.                              &quot; Sub-Committee No.Z.        &quot; To consider the question  of unemployment,  and to  make recommendations    for the steps to be taken for its prevention, and for the maintenance of the unemployed    in those cases in which it is not prevented, both during the present emergency period,    and on a permanent basis.&quot;    The Chairman and Secretaries appointed to the Sub-Committees are as follows :                               Sub-Committee No. 1.            Chairman........     Sir Thomas Munro, K.B.E.            Secretary........    Mr. Robert Wilson.*                                Sub-Committee No. 2.                    &apos;            Chairman........    Professor L. T. Hobhouse, D. Litt.           . Secretary........    Mr. G. T. Reid.                               Sub-Committee No.  3.            Chairman ..     ......     Sir David Shackleton.            Secretary ..     ..     ..    ..    Mr. C. B. Hawkins.    On the 11th March the three sub-committees met and commenced work.  The firstsub-committee entered on its task of considering  trade negotiations,  wage advances,measures of regulating wages and the establishment of  a permanent industrial council.It was hoped, that the A.S.E., railwaymen, miners and transport workers, who were notparticipating in the investigation would appoint representatives for the industrial council.The second committee commenced an inquiry into maximum hours and minimum wages.The third committee dealt with unemployment.  Reports will be made to the conferenceon the 4th April.Claims Conceded.    Railway Clerks. At a conference presided over by Sir Robert Home on the 7th and8th March, the Railway Clerks&apos; Association was granted official recognition; the ExecutiveCommittee of the Association has therefore suspended, its decision to strike, pending thecompletion of the final draft granting the recognition.Workers&apos; Demands.    Police. The Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, in  an  order  issued on the8th March, stated that recognition of the Police and  Prison Officers&apos; Union had definitelybeen refused by the Government.    The  new scheme for the constitution of Police Representative Boards was also pub-lished in this order, in spite  of the request, so the  Police Union alleges, of  the Repre-sentative Board that the scheme should not at present be made public.      * In the absence of Mr. H. J. Wilson, through illness, Mr. Henry Clay is acting as Secretary.
     The Union alleges that both the Representative Board and the sergeants of the force have made a clear announcement of their opposition to the Commissioners&apos; scheme.  It appears that the Representative Board and the Executive of the Police Union  are prac- tically entirely composed of the same persons, who are desirous that the  police should be officially represented by the Union instead of by the Representative Board  proposed by the Commissioner.     In connection with the police dispute it may be mentioned that the &quot; Herald &quot; (8th March)  in its report of the Industrial Conference of the 27th  February,  draws special attention to  the declaration of W. Marston, of the Police Union, that &quot; the days were past  when the Government could use the police as a tool against  any other section of the nation.&quot;     Unemployed Women. A deputation from the Women&apos;s Industrial League and other bodies representing the unemployed women in England and  Scotland was received by Sir Robert Home on  the 4th March.  Demands were put forward that (1) the Government should set machinery in motion to find employment for women, and failing such measures the unemployment donation should be continued ;  (2) that men and women dilutees should be treated alike; (3) that the newly acquired technical qualifications of the women ex- munition workers should be registered at Employment Exchanges, and that facilities to continue their training should  be at once arranged for these women during their unem- ployment.  It was further maintained by Lady Rhondda, President of the  League, that even if the  demand for domestic servants and laundry hands was satisfied, it would only touch the fringe of the problem.    Colliery Surface Workers. It appears that the colliery  surface workers are dissatisfied at having no direct  representation on  the  Coal  Commission.  It is reported that at a meeting of the Executive  of the National Council  of Colliery Workers it was proposed to appoint a deputation to wait on Mr. Justice Sankey, Chairman of the Coal Commission. Joint Meeting of Co-operators and Trade Unionists.    The first conference convened by the National Advisory Council of Trade Unionists and Co-operators was held in London on the 6th March.  Mr. G. H. Stuart Bunning in the course  of his speech stated  that the meeting  represented about five  million trade unionists and some three and three-quarter million co-operators.  A resolution was passed pledging support to  the policy of mutual  assistance  on  the- part  of trade union and co-operative  forces,  especially in connection with banking.   A further  resolution was passed which declared &quot; uncompromising opposition &quot; to all Government schemes  of protection and  the subsidising of private commercial combinations;  it also condemned the handing  over of national  factories  and ships to  private  firms.  At the same time, both the trade union and co-operative representatives declined to take over the national shipyards offered to  them  by the Shipping Controller, the trade unionists&apos;  reason being that while they possessed the working ability, the co.-operators had the money, and these two bodies had not yet reached the stage at which they could run the shipyards jointly. David Ramsey and W. F. Watson.    On  the 8th March a sentence of five months&apos; imprisonment in the Second Division was passed at Bow Street on David Ramsay for  a seditious speech  at Croydon in whichhe boasted of being a Bolshevik.  Ramsay formerly worked as a pattern-maker at Leicester, and  later worked  at Dartford.  In September  he became  treasurer of  the  NationalAdministrative  Council of the Shop Stewards&apos; and Workers&apos; Committee movement.    On  the same day W.  F. Watson was charged for making a seditious  speech at theAlbert Hall on the 8th February.  Watson is President of the London Workers&apos; Committeeand a contributor to the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot;  a Socialist paper edited by Sylvia Pankhurst.                                (2) District Reports. London and South-Eastern Area.    Employment--Discharges of labour continue.  Five hundred discharges from Enfield Small Arms Factory have  been notified for the  12th March, and the Walham Green Exchange reports that the London General Omnibus Company is discharging 300 women conductors, who are being replaced by discharged soldiers.    Dockers. Hours of labour and wages for  dock and  wharf  workers  are under dis-cussion.  The employers&apos; proposals accepting the principle of a 44-hour week have been referred by the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation to local negotiation.  The question of wages is in abeyance.
 south-western.     Effect of Floods in Somerset. Serious floods in the Midsomer Norton and Radstock district are responsible for throwing 700 men out of employment in the Somerset coalfield. Of those unemployed. the trade  union workmen  have elected to draw unemployment donation instead of receiving benefit from their own war fund.     British Channel boilermakers. The boilermakers in the British Channel ports, who have been on strike since the 22ND January, are to resume work on the 10TH March, pending a conference between employers and employed.     Aircraft Woodworkers. A wage question of some importance has arisen in the British and Colonial Aeroplane Company&apos;s works.  The claim of the aircraft woodworkers FOR Is. 3d. per hour was  heard in London and not established.  The British  and  Colonial Aeroplane Company had  been paying a private bonus of 10 per cent, on  earnings; it NOW intends to discontinue this at the conclusion of Government contracts. West Midlands.     Employment. Prospects are reported of  developments of work in silk-spinning and in look-making, which will provide employment for a large number of workers. Yorkshire and East Midlands.     Employment. In  Sheffield 60 per cent, of the unemployed are women  and  girls, 10 per cent, ex-soldiers, 30 per cent, civilian men and boys.   At Todmorden 620  per 10,000 of the population are out of work.  Unemployment is also serious at Bradford, Leeds, Hull, Ilkeston, and Nottingham.  Lack  of employment at Shipley is attributed to  a  shortage of wool supplies, and the release of wool and  the  removal of control are recommended. In the Ilkeston area unemployment has increased with the discharge of women from the National Filling Factory at  Chilwell.     There is a demand for labour in  the iron and steel industries.  Experienced forgers and stampers are wanted IN Lincoln.  &quot;Chesterfield pipe-founders  are receiving inquiries from Denmark and Holland,  which previously did business with Germany; but in Argentina they appear to be undersold by American firms.  Textile engineering firms in Long Eaton are expecting orders for lace machines for  France, a development which is viewed with less satisfaction by Nottingham lace manufacturers.     Prospective Discharges.--A grave  situation in the machine  industry is developing at Sheffield, where Messrs. Vickers have given  9,000&apos;employees a fortnights notice to termination- nate their employment on the 22ND March.  It is said THAT the firm intend to shut down their works pending the arrival of full supplies  of coal and a settlement of the miners&apos; dispute.   Other firms are considered likely to  follow this example.     &quot; Dilutees.&quot; A strike was threatened at THE works OF  Messrs.  Geo. Mann &amp; Co., Ltd., Hunslet, where two women  engaged as gaugers and examiners were objected  to by THE MEN, on the ground that the introduction of women in this capacity was a  new departure and unfair&apos; to the skilled men out of work.   The women have been withdrawn. Norih-Western.     Unrest. AT Manchester the unrest caused by unemployment was manifested by A demonstration ON the 5th March at which discharged sailors and soldiers were represented.    Another factor contributing to unrest  is the question OF dilution.  In one curious case, the local Allied Trades Committee demand the removal OF girls engaged  on certain work, while the workpeople,  contending that there is no case for the action  of  the Allied Trades Committee, support  the firm against their own officials.   The A.S.E.  appear TO be the prime movers in stressing the question of dilutees.    Strikes are in progress at the works of Messrs. Vickers, Ltd.,  Barrow (involving 350 workers), and among the Liverpool, Lancashire and Cheshire farriers (involving  680 men).    Transport Workers. The National Transport Workers&apos; Federation have circularised their members on the Mersey urging loyalty to and solidarity  with the Federation in view of possible national action  in the near  future. Northern.    Employment. Unemployment  in  this area is fairly acute-83,000 male and female employees were paid off during last week but the high-water mark is now believed to have been reached.  The strike for the 47-hour week ended on the  3RD March.  The steelplant of Messrs. Bolckow, Vaughan &amp;  Co., which closed down owing TO the coal shortage,has now re-started and ALL the men affected are again working.
     Shortage of. material is the reason alleged  for the dismissal of about 100 men fromthe finishing mills at the Cargo Fleet Ironworks.     The Mining Crisis. Great interest is shown in the mining area in the Coal Commissionproceedings, and public opinion which, outside the mining class, was against the claims of the Miners&apos; Federation, is veering round towards support of the miners&apos; claims.South Wales.     The Mining Crisis. The evidence put before the Coal Commission as to the profitsrealised during the war has accentuated the unrest in the South Wales mining area.     Tinplate Joint Council. On the 7th.March  there took place the first meeting of thejoint industrial council for the tinplate industry.     Alien Labour. In the Bristol Channel  ports, agitation is increasing  against  theemployment  of aliens, particularly Chinese, while British seamen  are  out of  work.Feeling is also  strong against the employment of 4,000  prisoners in the building  and shipbuilding trades and in  the national yards near Chepstow.Scotland.     Industrial Accidents.&apos; The Scottish Divisional Council of Local Advisory Committeesproposes  that,  when workers  are thrown  out of work by  industrial  accidents,  theindustry concerned should be made responsible for their  maintenance.  unemployment donation would not then be granted.     Jute  Trade  (Dundee). Complaints have been received  from  jute  manufacturersat Dundee that  trade is depressed owing to the unsettled state of labour, high wages,the cost of raw material, and the competition of Indian jute manufacturers.    Housing. The shipbuilding trade at Dundee is handicapped  only  by  the lack of housing accommodation, and a large number of additional men are required.  Shipbuildingfirms are looking for sites for new yards and workshops, and endeavours are being madeto meet the housing difficulty, at least temporarily, by the provision of wooden huts.    Shortage of  housing is also acute in Dunfermline.  The attention of the Board ofWorks and the Admiralty has been drawn to a number of empty houses under the controlof the Admiralty at Rosyth which might be used to relieve the congestion in Dunfermline.                                  PART V.-DISPUTES.                           (a) Involving a Stoppage of Work.Reported from  Various Sources.            The strike of transformer workers  at two Manchester firms which involved 300 men         ended on the 6th March; the men were granted a minimum rate based on a pre-war rate of        35s., whereas they had asked for one to be based on a pre-war rate of 39s.            No settlement has been reported of the strike of 5,000 miners at Messrs. Guest, Keen &amp;        NettlefokTs Dowlais Collieries over the question of whether or not the Coal Washery men&apos;s        dispute  (i.e., their claim to  be treated as colliery  workers since they have joined the Miners&apos;        Federation) should be treated as a Coal dispute.  The employers refuse to treat it as such.        The strike is unofficial.            A strike is in progress at the Eoyal Air Force Dismantling Works, Didcot, Berks., where        the workers include hundreds of demobilised soldiers.  They are demanding that the 48 hours        and 45s. weekly wage  guaranteed by the Labour Exchanges should  be paid them at these        works.            On the 5th March a strike occurred at the Raleigh cycle factory, Nottingham, as a protest        against  the reinstatement of a foreman who left the works some time ago.            Disputes affecting boilermakers, Bristol Channel, farmers, Lanes  and Cheshire, and em-        ployees  of Messrs Vickers, Barrow, are referred to in Part IV.            Unrest at Manchester, arising from unemployment  and  the question of dilutees, and in        the South Wales ports, in connection with the employment of aliens, is referred to in Part IV.                         (b)  Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.Reported from  Various Sources.            The miners  of Northumberland, Lancashire  and the Rhondda Valley have tendered strike        notices to expire on the 22nd March.  Owing to a dispute between the Nottinghamshire colliery        proprietors and miners, a stoppage of work in that district was anticipated on the 12th March,        involving about  40,000 men.  The miners have now suspended their notices until 22nd March.            A strike is threatened by the farm labourers of West Lancashire, who are demanding an        increase of 5s. per week.
