I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith for your Lordship&apos;s information a copyof a memorandum by Sir J. Beale, K.B.E., and reports * in regard to the food situationhi Germany, which were  laid by Mr.  Hoover before  the Supreme Economic Councnyesterday.                                            I have, &amp;c.                                                 W.  MITCHELL-THOMSON.RELIEF SUPPLIES FOR GERMANY.                      MEMORANDUM BY SIR JOHN BEALE.    1. SUFFICIENT  facts have  now been collected to  enable a  statement  to  beprepared showing the position of the Allies in relation to the relief of Germany.    The situation appears to be one of the utmost  gravity, calling for immediate consideration by the Supreme Economic Council and a decision on general policy beforethe next meeting with the German  delegates.    2. The Associated Governments have accepted a definite measure of responsibilityfor the prevention of famine in Germany by the utterances of their statesmen, and their participation in  the formation of the Allied Supreme Council of Supply and Relief, andits work,  as  well  as  by becoming   parties  to  the agreement  of Treves of  the17th January, 1919.    3. Though  the present rations  in Germany  are  very much  below the Alliedstandard, there appears to be no doubt that the food supplies in a large part of germany will be exhausted before many weeks are past the date will vary in different localities,but in some localities, shortages will  become apparent as early as the end of March orthe beginning of April.    This statement is founded, in the first instance, on information supplied h , german delegates at Conferences  at  Treves and Spa  in  connection with the renewal of thearmistice.   It is a significant fact that no report of any kind from any other source hasbeen laid before the Supply and Relief Council which would tend in any way to throwdoubt on  the accuracy of the statement of &quot;he. general position put forward by theGerman  delegates  or  to  lessen  the gravity of the outlook.  On the other hand,confirmation has been freely forthcoming.   I would refer to      (a.)  Military reports from the  occupied districts.     (6.) The attached report compiled from personal observations of fourteen British           officers who have  recently  returned from Germany.     (c.) Extract from a detailed report of two of those officers who visited Hanover.     (d.) A forcible statement  by Dr. Frederick Ferriers, Chief of the  Executive of the           International  Red Cross, who is convinced that the approach of famine is           nearer than  is understood by the Entente  agents  who have gone into           Germany, and that the approach of starvation must result in Bolshevism.     (e.) Reports from Dr. Alonzo Taylor, who has recently returned from a  Mission  of           enquiry in Berlin for Mr. Hoover.Not printed.
     4. It is difficult to establish the exact quantities of food required, but it should benoted:      (a.)  That the  agreement of the  17th  January provided for a first instalment of           200,000 tons of cereals (for part of which condensed milk may be substituted)           and 70,000 tons of fats, and the Council of Supply and Belief regarded  this           quantity at the time as a suitable basis for a monthly ration.     (6.)  The  Germans  themselves asked  for  approximately  double  this  quantity,           including certain other commodities.     (c.)  Dr. Taylor suggests the following quantities as minimum requirements :                320,000 tons flour or corresponding wheat monthly for six months.               100,000 tons mixed pork products monthly for six months.                 10,000 tons condensed milk monthly for four months.                 10,000 tons vegetable oils monthly for four months.     After consideration of all  the  various   reports  received  from  the interior ofGermany, it seems certain1 that Dr. Taylors estimate is not on the high  side.  On theother hand, it seems equally  certain  that  shipping, port, and railway difficulties mustprevent the importation and distribution of  so  large a quantity.  In my judgment, theSupreme  Economic Council ought to regard some such quantity as  200.000 tons ofbreadstuffs and 100,000 tons of fats and other commodities as a minimum to be workedto, and increased  if possible.     5. If, at their  Meeting on  the 25th  February, the  Supreme Economic Council are able to solve  the shipping and  financial  difficulties and give the Supply and  ReliefCouncil instructions to proceed with the supply at once on this  suggested minimumbasis, it  is  certain that the  food  in  such  quantities cannot  commence to arrive inGermany in regular monthly supplies before the middle or end  of May at the earliest,though certain consignments can be arranged in the meanwhile.     6. Negotiations following the agreement of the 17th January have disclosed serious difficulties in relation both  to finance and tonnage.     Finance. Negotiations at Treves and Spa in January and  February have resultedin the Germans providing 6,000,000L in a  manner acceptable to the Financial Delegates.This sum will pay for part of the first  instalment of food, amounting to  30,000 tons of pork  products, about 5,000 tons  of condensed milk, and  a small  quantity of  other commodities.   The  financial report of the  discussions  at Treves makes it clear that,though immediate payment may be forthcoming for the balance of the first instalment of foodstuffs,  it  is  practically certain that it will be  some  considerable  time  beforepayment can be provided for later instalments.  The minimum monthly supplies up tothe end of August are estimated to cost some 150,000,0()0L     Tonnage. The first part  of the first  instalment of foodstuffs for Germany will beprovided from surplus storks in the United Kingdom, and, since the Germans are notyet in a position to transact ordinary commercial business, and the bulk of the Germantonnage is to be handed to the Allies, it is proposed to arrange the transport from theUnited Kingdom to Rotterdam by the Ministry of Food chartering such ships as areavailable whether British or neutral or by using American ships  manned by theAmerican navy recently  used for transporting coal from the United Kingdom to france for the American army.   At the present time  the  United &quot;Kingdom holds large stocksof food, but, in spite of this, it requires a certain amount of arrivals to enable distribution to be maintained  from ports at which large stocks are not held.  Both France and Italyare anticipating difficulty in arranging sufficient tonnage for the transport of supplies for liberated countries, who are, by declaration of the Allies, and on all moral grounds,entitled to priority  over  Germany, while there  appears  at  present  to  be little  or  no prospect that German ships will be available in sufficient quantity to swell the volumeof imports to a satisfactory figure before the month of May at the earliest.  In  all ofthe Associated countries, the process of release  of  shipping control is being pushed forward rapidly.  Unless this process is checked, and, indeed, control reimposed to someextent, it would seem impossible to provide sufficient tonnage.     7. Put shortly, the position is      (a.)  The  Associated Governments are  not only  pledged to  provide  relief for           Germany, but must accept the fact that the need in Germany is so urgent           that,  if relief is not provided, anarchy must supervene.     (b.)  That the Allies are morally bound not to relieve Germany unless ample supplies           are forthcoming for Allied and liberated countries.
    (c.)  That the French and Italian food programmes  threaten to come so much in          arrear  as to cause  anxiety, while  there will be  difficulty in providing          adequate supplies for liberated countries.    The conclusions I arrive at on the general question are as follows:     (1.) The food situation  in  Germany is already serious, and will, unless drastically          helped from outside by immediate action, be  so desperate in a  few months          that Germany will probably be overtaken by economic and political disaster,          with consequences which may spread to Allied countries.    (2.) It is  impossible, under present conditions, which require Germany to pay in          actual cash  for all food she  receives, for the  Associated  Governments to          supply food in sufficient quantities to meet Germany&apos;? needs,  and it is there-          fore difficult to  see how  the Associated Governments  can  escape  some          measure of  responsibility, unless the blockade  is lifted promptly so far as          food is concerned, and Germany  is  left  free to make her own  importation          arrangements.    (3.) It seems essential that peace (or preliminary terms of peace) should be settled          immediately, since blockade must be retained as a lever to secure acceptance          of the terms.    Meanwhile, it is the duty of the Associated Governments (and, indeed, a necessityin their own interests)  to  arrange a  steady flow of supplies to Germany to such extent as the prior  claims will permit.   For this purpose large credits must be provided,and, so far as they cannot be furnished by the  Germans, should be made a first charge on future  payments by  that  country, and a substantial  volume of shipping must bemade available  by the Associated countries until German shipping is forthcoming.                                                           J. FIELD  BEALE    Paris, February 21, 1919.  Telegram communicated by the Admiralty to the Foreign Office, February 27, 1919.(No. 357.)                 From D.I.S.L. for Panac and to circulate in office.    The  Food Section  of  the  Supreme Economic Council  have had before them thefollowing telegram from General Haking, dated the 25th January :          &quot;The  Germans  to-day  have  made  an  urgent  request  for  following to be    forwarded at  once from  Rotterdam:  30,000 tons of pork products and 250,000    cases condensed milk, without waiting for the decisions of Paris Commission.   This    only a small affair, and I strongly recommend that the demand should be agreed to.    General Nudant had telegraphed to Marshal Foch in  the same sense.  This food is    required for mothers and children.  Germans state that many  latter are now dying    for want of proper nourishment.&quot;    The  following  reply has  been  sent  to  General  Haking  by  Council, with myconcurrence:                                               -.         &quot; 1. Marshal Foch sent telegram on Sunday to Spa stating that no food could be    delivered to Germany until substantial progress had  been made in handing  over    passenger and cargo vessels under clause 8 of armistice of 16th January.         &quot;2. Convention of 17th  January  stipulated that  delivery  of vessels   was    condition precedent to import of food.         &quot; 3. Delay in handing over ships  has gravely menaced our ability to transport    necessary supplies for liberated countries and Germany,  and  public opinion would    not tolerate any supply to Germany while they are in default.         &quot; 4. Up  to the  present  it has only been possible to arrange to ship a small    part of the supplies named to Rotterdam, but these can be sold to Germany,  and    arrangements for  shipping  balance can be pushed on vigorously as  soon  as-    substantial progress has been  made with handing over ships.         &quot; 5. Delivery of all vessels named as ready to sail on the 1st and 12th February    wouid be*considered substantial progress.&quot;o
