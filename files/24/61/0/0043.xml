VH,       This Document is the Property of 5) *\u;.- His Britannic MajQSty&apos;8 Government.Confidential,Political Intelligence Department,17th August, 1918.Foreign Office, S.W.I. POLAND/002.According to the Hague despatch in to-day1 s &quot;Times11 (August 17th) the &quot;Lokal-Anzeiger&quot; indicates that ua solution of the Polish problem will &quot;be readied in a form to which Austria^Hungary has agreed, which will &quot;be the choice of an Austrian Archduke, presumably Karl Stephan&apos;1.This would seem the most natural way out of the deadlock which has arisen over the ;iAustrian Solution&quot;.     The choice of an Austrian Archduke is to satisfy the dynastic ambitions of the Habsburgs, but Germany can easily afford to-make this concession, for a Kingdcn of Poland unconnected either with Russia or Austria would come under her influence from whatever dynasty its king were chosen.     In view of the defeats sustained in the west and of the renewed activity of the Entente in Russia, Germany has to solve the problems of the occupied territories in a way which would make them into a barrier for her in the east.     Poland&apos;s adherence to such a scheme can be obtained in no other way than by satisfying the imperialist ambitions of her upper classes, which would of course be clone at the expense of Russia.     Prince Janusz Raclziwill, the chief Of the Political Department (Ministry for Foreign Affairs) in the Fciish government) and Count Adam Ronikier are reported to have gone to German Head-quarters.     Prince Radziwill is a leading Conservative, and Count Ronikier was until 1916 a National Democrat.     Both are Imperialists and are certain to have demanded that at least the parts of Vilna and Grodna not yet definitely assigned to Lithuania or the Ukraine, and that parts or the whole of the Governments of Minsk and Mohilev should be handed over to Poland.
Although the Poles torn he.rO.lj more than about one-tent-: of their population, the Polish upper classes have very con-siclerable vested interests in those territories.    Their population Is White Russian, end Russia can never permanently renounce theh) - even the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk had left most ox these districts to Russia.     If they are assigned to Poland, any recovery of Russia will threaten , her long before it threatens either Germany or Austria.    This is the reason why the best German political thinkers and statesmen,  such as Hans Delbrtlck, Naumann, Ersberger, Gothein and David have for seme time past pleaded in favour of the Polish imperialist claims.The appointment of a P0lish King is likely to be followed by the handing over of P0landrs admiiri strati ova to the Poles, and by the raisin.;&apos;;, ox a Polish army.    The Conservative upper classes, the Imperialists actthe entire clergy will rally to the Throne and clinr tc the acquisitions in the east.     Such a settlement would from our point cf view be the most dangerous development in Polish politics which has yet occurred in the course of this war.Since the above was written three&quot; telegrams have beenireceived from Sir H. Rurfbold dated August 14th and marked Eos, 1373-1375.     The last sentence in Ho. 1374 confirms our supposition that White Russia war; discussed at Headquarters. The sense of No. 1375 is not clear: it seems to foreshadow a partition of white Russia between P0land and Lithuania,     The Lith.uanis.ns are not likely to wis--. for. or even to agree to the inclusion of the whole of white Russia in the new Lithuanian Statej for the white Russians would then be considerably in the majority.     &quot;Polish aspirations In other quarters&quot; probably
mmeans parts of White Russia not included in Lithuania.    A Polish-Lithuanian alliance   would thus be formed under Gorman auspices on a clearly anti-Russian basis.     But in view of the divergent social interests an alliance between Poles and Lithuanians would have no more stability, and even less, than that concluded between the late Ukrainian Rada an&quot;, the Germans. The report of an agreement for relations&quot;so close that frontier between them would, practically cease to exist!; dees not sound credible anyhow.
