(THIS, POCUjS^T IS THE property OF HIS EiUTANNIC UAJLSTYJS GOVERHIGHT.SECRET.V A R   C A..B I H E T,g.t-.-5500..pensions of officers&apos;  .7id0vs.Observations on Note &quot;by i-r. Chamberlain. ( 0,1.5471) .It is not quite, clear to.what class of pensions Mr. Chamberlain is referring;. TKCrx arc two kinds (broadly speaking) -(a) those given for death due to war service or on duty (1Highe st&quot; and &quot;Int ermedi ate&quot;)(b) those given in respect of length of service (Regular officers)   (ordinary&quot;) ,The expressions in tht Note &quot;where the recipients are shown to be -in necessitous circumstances&quot; and &quot;for their husbands&quot; services before 1914&quot; point to class (b).    If these are meant, the answers arc -(i) Such pensions are not granted at all to widows of II.CO 1 s and men;(ii) The &quot;ordinary&quot; pensions of Warrant Officers&apos; widows have not been increased;.(iii)-These pensions are granted and administered by tho War Office and not by the Ministry of Pensions,If, however,  class (a) is intended, which do not depend on means or length of service, the reply is that the rates of pension for widows of officers who have lost thtir lives in the present war have not (with&quot;one exception) been increased,  and therefore there is no claim, on this account for increasing the pensions of widows of former wars.-    The only exception is the raising of the pensions of widows&quot; of Lieutenants and Second Lieutenants to the Captain&apos;s rate, the reason for this being that in the present war there has been a much greater degree of chance in regard to promotion to Captain&apos;s rank.    .This amendment was carried out in 1915 after the report.of a&apos;Select Committee of which kr.&apos; Chamberlain was a member.     The Committee did .not recommend that the other rates,  (which have been in force since 1881) should be changed, and hr. Barnes and his Statutory Advisers, when preparing the new Warrant of 1917, were of a like opinion. . .The advantages which have been conceded to officers&apos; . widows in the present war have been in the direction of v^laxing thu conditions admitting to the highest and intermediate ratoiu but it would obviously be quite impractical, now to review the evidence, medical and otherwise, of cases which-occurred in past wars and determine how they would be- roclassifiod under new regulations.
