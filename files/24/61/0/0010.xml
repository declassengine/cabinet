I circulate to the war Cabinet a Memorandum, which has been prepared for me by the Coal Controller, dealing with the Coal situation.     In view of the urgency of the matter I trust that an immediate decision may be taken on the questions raised.A. H. SMILEY.Board of Trade,15th August, 1918.

These tables disclose an ascertained deficit of 9,500,000tons.   To this must boadded any increased demands from the Min-istry of Pood, Board of Agriculture, and the American Army.On the other hand, no allowance lias been made for anytheincreased output thrpugft/efforts -inch are being made to induce the minors to reduce voluntary absenteeism and to increase individual output through an extra effort.It is perhaps desirable to give a short history of recent recruiting of Colliery workers.lien the arrangement for the withdrawal of the first 50,000 mon was agreed to last autumn, the situation, as far as it could be foreseen at that time, permitted the withdrawal of that number(specially from the exporting districts)without seriously interfering with the necessary supplies of coal.The net decrease in output for the year ending 31st De-comber last for the whole Country as compared with 1916 was 7,875,000 tons, whereas in the exporting districts alone the decrease was 9,345,000 tonr..Thus, although the miners insisted that a system of comb out by quotas in each district in proportion to the number of men employed should be adhorod to, it was folt that by a scheme of Mobility Bureaux sufficient labour could be removed from the exporting districts to the districts producing coal for inland consumption to meet the increased requirements of the inland trade,\Then the German advance came at the end of March, a re-quest was made by the hinister of National Service for a fur-ther 50,000 Grade I mon.
It was recognised  that th? withdrawal of such a largenumber of Grade I men ixom the mines must seriously reduce the output and ncoossitato a system of rationing of house-hold ant industrial cool which must cause considerable unemployment and discomfort,   nevertheless the need of men for the Army was at that time so urgent and so insistent that after carefully considering the consequences of withdrawing these mm it was decided they should be tafcen.Immediately afterwards Fraaoe demanded more coal owing to the fall in output from their Pas de   Calais mines.   The shipping situation also improver&quot; and more export coal was required.    The matter was a-ain cone idered whon it w- s decided to withdraw only 86,000 Grade I men and that 25,000 miners of low medical category should be returned from the Array.&apos;J?he present position as regards recruiting is that 69,049 of the 75,000 men have been posted and 0,588 of the 35,000 returned to the mines,    Hot only has the progress of reoruit-raent taien very much longer than *.-ae anticipated, extending already over a period of nearly 5.months with ell its attendant dislocation in working the collisiros, but the output has been fuxthor reduced by failure of the ?far Office to return prompt-ly the 85,000 men which to-day only reachec the figure of 8,508.
n otA further quite urorpectsd factor is the influenza ep i demi c af.fe-ct-j.ng-the manremployed. in..ihe^-(Jellieriea-Ahrongfrout-the Coal Fields.    The loss of output on this account alone amountoa to nearly 2 million tons in the month of July.The demands in connection with the American Expedit-ionary Force are increasing day by day from 50,000 tons per month in the Autumn last year to 500,000 to 750,000 tons per month which is the last demand made from the American Director General of Transport.All these factors have combined to make the coal position at the present time far worse than was anticipated in June both as regards Export and the supplies for inland consumption.     Unfortunately all this has occurred during the period when normally stocking for the winter peak load of the Public Utility Undertakings of the country is done and when transport (both by rail and sea) is far easier than in jibe-winter months.In the table ^bewingHhe increases of the sources of supply account is taken of the stock at pits ana of the consumers sfocks-at^forks but it must be remembered that if the War JLasts until next year these stocks will have die-
(mi vmw%.Controller of Goal &quot;lines.Arrangements-are being made for a publicity campaign inGreat. Britain with a view to inducing the miners to improvetheir output, and alto to induce the consumers of coal, notonly domestic consumers tut industrial consumers as well, toleave no stone unturned which will result in a reduction ofthe demands msde for fuel. In connection with the $tip? osedto inaugurate a publicity campaign it should be mentionedthat at a recent meeting which  )I hiid-with        - .the newly-elected Executive of the B. M. F. for the purposeof putting the Coal situation before that body, Mr Sraillie,the President of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain,after handing in the two resolutions quoted below, stated -&quot;V7e have agreed to these resolutions and if you sent outsidespeakers v either mining speakers or Government speakers -into any district I was connected with, so far as I wasconcerned I would wash my hands of the whole thing.&quot;The resolutions are as follows:-&quot;That the question of increased output be left with &quot;districts, and that districts he advised to carry cut the &quot;pledge given by the Executive Committee in connection with &quot;the wasxs question to secure the highest possible output0 1   CO do. . &apos;&quot;That we tell the Controller that we make it a condition &quot;before taking any aotion to increase the output that no more &quot;men are taken from the mines for the Army with the exception &quot;of those required to make up the agreed &quot;quota at certain &quot;collieries, and further that everything is done to &quot;expedite the return of losr category men from the Army.&quot;After carefully reviewing the whole position, and having regard.to the increasing demands for coal,   I \ recommendid that 25,000 Grade I men, and the remainder of the 25,000 low category minors, -be returned to the mines no later than the 30th September, 1918.Board of Trade,14th August, 1918,
