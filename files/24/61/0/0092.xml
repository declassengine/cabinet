m] &apos; 270SECRET.MINISTRY  OP   FOOD.Report for Week ending Wednesday, August 21, 1918.PART I.-ACTION TAKEN.Inter-Allied Food Council.Committee of Representatives. -The Committee of Representatives has held one meeting since the last Report. The Chairman was authorised to place the Importation Programme and the memorandum dealing with the establishment of priorities before the Allied Maritime Transport Council as soon as possible, and to suggest a joint conference between the Committee and the Council. A conference between the Committee and the Council has now been arranged, and the first meeting will take place on Friday, the 23rd inst.The Committee has appointed a Purchases Committee to supervise and ensure the Purchase Programme. This Committee held its first meeting on Wednesday, the 21st inst., under the chairmanship of Sir John Beale, and discussed preliminary business.Before leaving England for America Mr. Hoover sent the following letter to Mr. Clynes :-Embassy of the United States of America, My dear Mr. Clynes, 16th August, 1918.I would like to express my personal appreciation for the many kindnesses that I have received at the hands of yourself and the Food Ministry, and the hope that we may be long connected in a common cause, which I regard as the most humane of all those growing out of the war. It comes to but few of us to have the opportunity of service in the alleviation of distress that arises out of the conflict itself, and with this common ideal in view there can be no difficulty in any co-operative arrangement. You have only to command us and. we will do our best.Yours faithfully,Herbert Hoover.Orders under Defence of the Realm Regulations.(1) The Milk Products (Returns) Order, dated 14th August, 1918, requires all importers of condensed milk (other than canned condensed milk), dried milk, or sugar of milk into Great Britain between January 1st, 1917, and July 31st, 1918, to furnish returns showing the amount of such articles imported, and declaring the country of origin. The Order further requires a return of the amount of stock held in Britain, and the quantity purchased abroad, in transit, or awaiting shipment on August 24.(2) The Small Apple (Temporary Prices) Order, dated 15th August, 1918, restricts dealings in, and regulates prices for undersized apples. The object of the Order is to prevent the premature picking and selling of apples. No apples which can pass through a two-inch ring, with the exception of certain varieties, may be sold to any person other than a licensed jam manufacturer, and the growers&apos; price for such apples shall not exceed 121. per ton.(3) The Cereals (Restriction) Order, 1918, dated 15th August, 1918, regulates the sale of wheat, rye, barley, and dredge corn, including tailings, dressings, and screen-ings, according as they are fit or unfit for the purposes of human food. Cereals fit for human food may only be sold to (1) a miller for a controlled flour mill; (2) a recognised dealer in grain ; (3) a manufacturer licensed to use them for a manufac-turing business; (4) a person buying for the purpose of seed. In case of cereals unfit for use in human food, it is illegal to sell 10 cwt. or less, except with a certificate to the effect that the article is so unfit. A buyer of such 10 cwt. or less requires no certificate before using the article as food for live stock,   TJie seller of more thanJl  (33)6275-*   Pk 1 &apos; 135   8/18  B k S A
10 cwt. requires no licence to sell, but the buyer may only use the articles so bought under licence. For the purpose of administering the Order, the Local Authorities Branch of tho Ministry of Food is appointing grain officers under the control of tho Divisional Food Commissioners.   The Order does not apply to Ireland.(4) The Wild Babbits (Prices) Order, dated 10th August, .1918, prescribes maximum prices by weight for wild rabbits on and after 2nd September. On a sale other than by retail, the price will be (1) to a collector buying in the ordinary course of his business, Qd. per lb.; (2) on any other sale, Sd. per lb. On sale by retail, the price will be at the rate of Q\d. per lb. Food committees are granted certain powers to vary the rates in order to meet increased cost of carriage.(5) The Shredded Suet (Maximum Prices) Order, 1918, dated 19th August, 1918, fixes maximum prices lor shredded suet, and prescribes certain limitations on the sale of articles as shredded suet.1 Supplies and Pmces.Bacon, Ham, and Lard.-k deputation of the National Federation of Provision Merchants&apos; Associations attended on the 15th August and discussed claims in connection with forward bacon and other subjects. The representations made are receiving consideration.The shortage of bacon in Ireland continues, and a further thousand tons are being shipped from Liverpool to relieve the situation. The Food Control Committee for Ireland is not at present willing to import American bacon through the former channels, but the position of wholesalers in Great Britain who were engaged in the Irish trade must be considered if the export of American bacon into Ireland continues.Mr. Morrell will visit America early in September in connection with the pur-chases, of bacon, ham, and lard by the Ministry of Food.Butter-k distribution of butter was made to the retailers and caterers on August 19th, amounting to 4,300 tons.No further purchase in the United States of America have been advised since J uly 9th ; the total stocks in store in the United States of America awaiting shipment on August 17th totalled 712 tons. ;During the week ending August 17th advice was received of the purchase of 150 tons of Canadian butter at a cost of $14-0,160, while the quantity in store amounts to 732 tons.Total: arrivals in the United Kingdom during the week ending August .17th amounted to 174 tons, while the quantity of butter afloat on that date was 1,840 tons.Butter stocks in hand total 13,000 tons.Cheese.-2,558 tons of Canadian cheese have arrived in this country. Further shipments, amounting to 2,255 tons, make a total of 8,819 tons of cheese on the way. Unshipped stock amounts to 8,121 tons.Recent arrivals of United States of America cheese in this country amount to 124 tons. Further shipments: of 15 tons bring the quantity now on the way up to 104 tons.   Unshipped stock amounts to 1,508 tons.Cocoa.-Shipments of raw cOcoa from the Gold Coast during this month amount to about 2,500 tons as reported up to date;The scheme for the distribution of raw cocoa has been circulated to all persons concerned, and will be put into operation as from August 26th. After that date no manufacturer will be able to obtain raw cocoa except on vouchers issued by the Distribution Committee.Coffee. -The consumption of coffee continues low. The Ministry has consented to the export to Sweden of 6,000 tons of Prize Court coffee on representations made by the Treasury and the Foreign Office.- Cotton Oil. It is suggested by. the American Food Administration that the Ministry of Food should state its requirements for January to June 1919, and should agree to take the same at the price fixed for the American Food Controller for American home consumption. ;       ; - 1Dried Fruits.  .r,. (a) Greece. Another ship with 3,600 tons of currants has left for the United Kingdom.(6) India. Some 1,500 tons of sultanas have been purchased for imme-diate shipment. &quot;&apos; &apos;&quot;&apos;  1 &apos;:&apos; &apos;     ;     - &quot;&apos; ;&quot;
(c) Basra. The unofficial reports: mentioned last week, have now been confirmed by the G.O.C., Mesopotamia.   The date crop has been largely, affected by blight, and when complete reports as to the exportable surplus are received, it will be necessary for all Departments to re-adjust their programmes.(d) Spain and Portugal. The Treasury have sanctioned the purchase of 5,000 tons of 1918 crop of dried fruits, and arrangements will be made to purchase in Spain through Captain Williams, of the A.S.C., and in Portugal through the Official Brokers. Owing to Army demands, it is improbable that any Valencia raisins will be available for-the civil population.Most of the dried fruits distributed under the recent general distribution have now been got away from ports. Apart from some complaints from retailers of short weight, the distribution appears to have been as successful as the limited quantities available allowed.Jam. The organised collection of the blackberry crop in England, Scotland and Wales is being undertaken by the Divisional Commissioners in their respective areas, financial assistance being given, and packages for the conveyance of the fruit to the jam manufacturers being supplied from headquarters. Ten pulping stations are being equipped to deal with blackberries, apples, and possibly oranges.Return of stocks of, jam with manufacturers on 31st July has been obtained, showing quantity available for civilian consumption as 22,465 tons, with a store of 21,013 tons of pulp.Meat. The restrictions upon the sale.of veal having been removed by the Calves (Sales) Order, a schedule of maximum retail prices for veal have now been prescribed, and will come into operation on the 26th.During the past week, with very few exceptions, there has been a decrease in the quantity of live stock passing through the markets ; this decline, however, is likely to be only temporary, being largely due to the fact that nearly every man in the agri-cultural districts is employed on the harvest, and no one can be spared to take stock to market.The fact that consumption falls below the prescribed ration, indicates that a reduction in the rations can be made without inflicting any considerable hardship at all upon consumers in the mass. In many parts of the country, especially where a fair proportion of fresh meat was procurable, the public restricted their purchases to a very large extent to the fresh meat and preferred not to makeup their ration with the frozen meat which was available. During the next two or three months it is hoped that the meat&apos;supplied will be almost entirely home grown, and the opportunity will be taken to re-establish the reserve supplies of the Ministry, which have been recently depleted. It is proposed that the reduction in the ration shall coincide with the advance in prices, and the two measures combined are estimated to provide a ration of a fraction less than one pound per head.   .Complaints have been less numerous of late and now deal mainly with the distribution.of home-killed meat. It is a very difficult matter to adjust the claims of producing and industrial areas. If these claims are to be met equitably, it can only be done by disregarding to some extent the instructions that transport is to be minimised as much as possible, and it will become a matter of adjustment between these conflicting aims. The position in London has been particularly difficult in this respect. - ,Milk. The Advisory Committee on the financial arrangements in connection with the control of milk distribution met on August 15th and August 20th. Its terms of reference are as follows :  ;&apos; 1To advise the Food Controller on the financial arrangements to be made with manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers in connection with the scheme for the control of milk distribution, and to recommend the best means of securing that any increase in the value of their business due to the operation of Government control may accrue to the State.Organised Distribution.A Conference of Divisional Food Commissioners took place on the ] 6th of August, at which Mr. CJynes was present for a short time. The advice&quot; of the Commissioners was taken with regard to various recently inaugurated Distribution schemes, and other matters were discussed.
The National Rationing Scheme appears to be working well throughout the country. The chief difficulty experienced in connection with it is with regard to the returns required from retailers. In view of the depletion of their stalls, it is necessary to reduce the returns asked for to the lowest possible minimum.It is proposed to bring into operation a scheme for the adjustment of supplies of &quot;grocery syrup &quot; for manufacturing purposes. Application will be made by manu-facturers using syrup to the Ministry of Food, and authority to obtain supplies as from October 5th will be granted, on a basis which will enable makers of pastries, cakes, and biscuits, who are the principal sufferers under the present datum period system, to obtain larger supplies than they do at present. The scheme will at the same time secure a record of their use of sugar.It is reported from the Western Division of Scotland that supplies of home-fed cattle and sheep are coming into the Glasgow Market in large numbers, and of good quality.Enforcement of Orders.The number of prosecutions recorded this week is considerably larger than usual. The total is 1,331, with 1,208 convictions. The numbers are due to two causes  the inclusion of 457 cases from the North Western Division which were omitted last week, and secondly some belated cases from the city of Liverpool.England contributed 982 cases with 91 per cent, convictions.Scotland       ,,       92     ,,       89     ,,Wales ,,        12     ,,     100Ireland ,,      245     ,,      87The responsibility for the prosecutions was as follows :  Cases.Local Authority     -        -        -       -        - 655Food Control Committees  -        -        -        - 275Procurator Fiscal   -        -        -        - 91Police       -        -        -        -        -        - 49Divisional Food Commissioner      -        -        - 10Ministry    .        -  -     -        -        - 6The Divisions which sent in the largest number of cases were : Division. - Prosecutions.

PART IL-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.Imports.The week ending August 17th was characterised by a serious and widespread fall in imports. The aggregate quantity of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs received was only 129,300 tons against 170,200 tons in the previous week, and 282,300 tons in the corresponding week of last year (Table A). The fall was marked in. cereals; all were substantially lower. Wheat and wheaten flour in equivalent grain declined from 02,900 tons to 42,200 tons. To find so small an import of wheat it is necessary to turn back to the last week in March. The past four weeks have seen a steady fall in certain imports as is shown by the figures given in the table below. Against an import of 10,000 tons in the preceding week, no rice at all was received. The receipt of oats, however, though lower on the week, was three times as great as the average for the preceding weeks of the year. Contrasted with 43,200 tons of maize received during the week ending August 18th, 191.7, the drop this week to 2,700 tons is striking.. The improvement in butchers&apos; meat is noticeable as an exception to the general, falling tendency. Beef rose from 1,400 tons to 13,400 tons ; not since early in March has this figure been exceeded. For the first time for several weeks arrivals of bacon and hams were insufficient to meet current consumption. In view of the large reserve stored up by recent heavy importation this decrease is of little consequence.Sugar fell from 34,000 tons to 26,200 tons, and tea from 5,200 tons to 2,600 tons. Coffee was again a negligible import, but cocoa improved.Arrivals of cheese were higher, but the past four weeks have seen an addition to the already serious deficit in 1917 : Week ending	Wheat and Flour (as Grain).

In spite of decreases in certain areas the number of animals coming forward for slaughter, in the week ending August 10th was in the aggregate consider-ably higher. Cattle rose 28 per cent, on the week before, sheep 23 per cent. (Table C). Little change took place in the quanity of frozen meat distributed.Fish. Supplies at Billingsgate for the week ended August 17th rose 184 tons to 2,536 tons. The fluctuation in supply during the last few weeks has been much less than during the corresponding period of last year.Milk.-The index number of milk supply (Table E) has fallen steadily since the middle of June and now stands at 102^. The total fall during the past four weeks has been 4  points against 7 points in the preceding four weeks.Wholesale Prices.The Gazette price of oats has risen sharply to 55s. lid. per quarter from 46s. 3c?. per quarter, an increase of 9s. Sd. A year ago the price was almost identical. Barley has advanced from 57s. Id. per quarter to 61s. 4d per quarter.i   6275-4B
