*1 vuawan&amp;ua 1a)Sj^ArWr^l&apos;    ,tfre   SES SZ of MS Britannic Ha.je3tvr&apos;s Government,AH   CABINET. MOBILIZATION OP GREECB* mORAOTI BY T&amp;ES SECRETARY OF STATS K)R flAJU(Por previous papers see G.T. 3^,74, 3559. 3922,4241, 4255,   4362,4796, and 5149V,At, a meeting of the war Cabinet on the 19th of r Cabinet   April last;* certain decisions that had been arrived at by minute IL General Smuts wlifc regard to the mobilization of the Greek Forces were approved,.     These were to the effect that we should undertake responsibility for supplying seven Greek divisions in the tyar Zone and should undertake the clothing of the greek Army in general up to that figure, with its ,4255*       depotet/   These decisions were at a later date altered by General smuts, in view of strong representations from the French and the Greeks, to make the number of divisions nine instead of seven.    In the Convention subsequently passed (GvT.479o) it was agreed that the maintenance of the divisions also included their reserves in the war Zone up to a maximum of 50 per cent.It had not until recently been proposed that more than nine divisions should be assembled in the *7ar Zone. But for several months past another division (it is called the 9th division) has been in existence, stationed at Kpirus^ The War office has now been informed officially by the French that the Commonder-in-Chief of the Allied Armies in Macedonia would like to have this division brought up into the war Zone, that the Greek Government are willing to transfer it under the same conditions as, the other Greek divisions, and that the transfer could begin at the end of August.    we have had information to the same effect from our own representatives at Athens,.    This would mean that we should be expected to make ourselves responsible fox feeding approximately an additional 17,500 Greek troops as soon as the move took place and possibly for feeding about 9,000 reserves at a later date.It should be noted that this 9th division having been organised for sometime is presumably fairly efficient, whereas tv;o of the peloponnesian divisions have only  very recently been mobilised; from the military point of view the 9th division ouaht to be an asset as soon as it takes ite place on the Macedonian front.    There is moreover thi&amp; additional reason for agreeing, that from communications received from Macedonia there seems some likelihood of two Greek divisions , in   addition to the three already in hie area, toeing placed under General Milne&apos;3 orders, which is desirable from our point of view.    The fact of there being a total of ten divisions in the War Sons would increase &apos; the probability of such a distribution of the Greek $orcas,I suggest that the War Cabinet should afpree inf principle to our undertaking to feed ten divisions with 50 $er cent reserves in the War Zone* in place of nine.-    But J t:ould propoee that they should at the same time fir, the maximum number of men that we oan undertake to keep clothed at 300,000*    That was the number contemplated during the yranco-3ritish negotiations last Autumn and. .(although it 4*- AOt
 1+1Anot stated in so many wordo) 300j0Q0 Is the number v;e have virtually m/cle ourselves responsible for under the recent Convention^   There is some tendency on the part of the Greeks at present to mobilise more men than they oan use.   Their mechanical transport and transport generally&apos; is so far in arrears that there is a fireat danger of their recruited numbers altogether outrunning the numbers that can be put into the field dfeand of our having to clothe and food a quantity of men who could ^have no effect on the course of the Wart26th August, 1910*
