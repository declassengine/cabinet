mmThis Document is th** Property ofic Majes;,ys3 GovernmentCONFIDENTIAL. (Aug. 12th, 1918.)Political Intelligence Department, Foreign Office.AMERICAN SHIPBUILDING.Extract from private.letter received iron U.3.A.&quot;At the Fore River Shipbuilding Company, which as you know has been in existence for some time and has recently been taken over by the Bethlehem Steel Company, they employ about 16,000 men and the yard is working its full capacity at present on a contract for 55 large torpedo boat destroyers for the United States Government, and a number of submarines. On some of the largest shif ways which were used for trans-ports before the war, they are now building as many as three submarines at once and they are turning out, I believe, a submarine every two weeks and a destroyer about every ten days.At Squantum the Government decided to build what they call the Victory Plant and last October they started on what was a marsh at a place near Atlantic.    The work has been completed and over 68 acres have been covered in for the work on the construction of the destroyers.    This plant will turn out 35 destroyers of the latest and largest pattern, all of them being oil burners.    There are ten ways and at present there is a boat under construction on each way. Secretary Daniels visited the plant oif the 24th April of this year and laid the keel of the first destroyer, and this boat will go over about the first of July, I understand, between 65 and 75% completed.    &quot;&quot;(hen the plant gets running at capacity, they plan to launch a destroyer every six days. V/hen you think of the terrible winter we had here this year
and the tremendous handicaps under which the contractors had to wrok, it certainly is a marvel when one sees what has been done.I was informed at both plants that they had an abundance of labor and as an illustration, the Superintendent told me that last If onday over 1200 men applied for positions at Squantum and that they only accepted 400 of this number, turning the rest away.    This shows what working conditions are prevailing in our ship yards and what attractive wages has done in bringing labor to the yards,One of the greatest problems at present is the housing proposition, and as you may have seen recently, the Government has appropriated over $60,000,000 to solve this problem and are now busily at work building attractive residences for the various workmen.At Hog Island, which was a marsh in October like Squantum, the work has progressed at a marvellous rate of speed and everything is going along in the most satisfactory manner in spite of the demagogues who have been howling in Congress, and I honestly believe not one word of truth exists in the various charges of delay and&apos; graft which were made a short time ago.    The Committee, I understand, has about wnvLeted their investigation &quot;and will give a eomplets white Wash to e^erf-one interested in the Hog Island proposition,At this yard they are employing about 20,000 men at present.    &quot;Then a man applies they immediately put him into , a school which consist ?f a typical cross section of the middle of one of the ships which they are going to work on later.    This section is erected and taken down continually by the men in the school, and as fast as a man proves that he is a fit workman he is graduated from the school to the
ship.Another new feature in this yard is the fact that instead of one nan going through and working on every part of the ship, the men are divided into many different gangs, one, for instance, laying the keel, another working on the ribs, another doing the bulk head, another doing the decks, etc. These gangs work on five different ways, one g^&apos;laying, the keel on way No. 1 and as soon as that is done they are moved to way No. 2 and gang No. 2 comes on way No. 1 to raise the ribs.    As soon as they are finished the first gang has com-pleted the keel on way No. 2 and the rib erectors\move on to way No. 2 and the keel layers move to way No. 3.    By the time the keel is laid on way No. 5 the ship on way No. 1 has been launched and the gang of keel layers move back to No. 1, In this way they keep up a continuous rotation and a spirit of competition is instilled among the men working on the different groups of ways.    They feel a great deal of speed may be developed by this method of co-operation,As you know, in all there are 50 ways at this yard, and at present the company has contracts for 200 ships which will mean 4 ships for each way.    These ships are of two types, 8,500 tons for cargo boats and 7,400 tons for trans-ports.&apos;,&apos;, The cargo boats have a speed of 11 to 12 knots and the&apos; transports from 15 to 16 knots.-    All are oil 0U*-:r r&apos;s oi the latest construction and practically no wood of any land is used in the boat, even metal fumit/are being used entirely,To give you an idea of the sise of this yard- 1 understand that it is bigger than the 7 largest ship yards in England, and that this yard alone will turn out over 1,600;000 tons of shipping each year which is more than the total pro-duction of England in 1917.
Each way is equipped with 8 cranes, 4 on each side, so that any part of the ship may be reached by at least two cranes, thus eliminating any possible delay from the break-age of any one crane.    These ships are all what are called fabricated shifts and are being built on Henry Ford&apos;a method used in the construction of his automobile.    There are approximately 250,000 parts to, each ship.    These parts are drawn out and designed in the yards at Hog Island by the engineers and a pattern is made.    These patterns are then sent broadcast all over the country to the various concerns who have contracts to make these parts.    They are then, as rapidly as they are made, sent forward to Hog Island and the railroad comes right into their distributing yard.    In this distributing yard there are 250rG0O piles and each pile only has one particular section of the ship.    Each way then draws-from a pile as the ship requires the part in question. As you can see, this method is very rapid and enables a number of steel mills to be working on the same thing and insures the utmost speed.    It has been figured out that ever 628.000 rivets have to be driven in each ship and that about 200,000 of these are driven outside in the form of bulk heads all of which are erected on platforms beside the ship and are $hen hoisted in one piece and dropped right into the   ship *ii pi$W2^ which allows a great many more men than is ordinarily the censo, to work cn one ship at one time,As worked out- at present, the company plans that they shall complete a ship every 87 days for launching and that after the launching it will probably take some 30 to 35 davs to finish the interior such as the installation of the engines and other details.    Most all the boilers are in-stalled before the ships go into tire water.    %en all the
ways are completed and the ships are being built on schedule, they will be launching a ship every other day.    At present, 29 keels have been laid and they anticipate launching the first ship some time in August,    This is going some when you realize the size of the proposition and the fact that the work was not started until the middle of October,At the New York Shipbuilding Company, I saw them building everything from dreadnoughts to destroyers and also saw the largest dreadnought in the world which is &amp;bout completed and will probably make her trial trip in the near future.    The transports are being built there in large quantities.    On the ordinary way which formerly, only held one transport, I saw on each sode of the larger boat, two destroyers being built at the same time.At this yard the Tuckahoe was built, launched in 27 days and completed and turned over to the Emergency fleet Corporation in a total of 57 days from the time the Keel was laid which is the  record for a ship of her size, which I believe was about 3500 tons.    On one way I saw a boat which was going to be launched the following day that was totally equipped from stem to stem with her boilers in, siroke stack on and steam up, so that as soon as she slid off moo the water she would steam out to sea and. be delivered to the Emergency Fleet Corporation.
