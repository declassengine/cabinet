Fighting took placs during most of the outward and return journeys as a result of which one of our machines was driven down out of control and three hostile machines were driven down out of control.Two hostile aerodromes Various ground targets.These were attacked with bombs and machine gun fire.FRANKFURT HAGENAUAeroplane and chemical works Aerodrome.In spite of unfavourable weather conditions one squadron successfully attacked the works of Frankfurt.   Bursts were observed well in the centre of the objective.   Large numbers of E.A. attacked and kept up a running fight, for about 30 miles.   Two E.A&apos;. were destroyed. All our machines returned safely.   Another of our squadrons attacked the hostile aerodrome at Hagenau with excellent results-   This squadron just after crossing the lines met large numbers of EiA. and at once decided to give battle.   As the result of severe fighting , four E*A. were destroyed and one other driven down out of control.   Two of our machines are missing.   The Bquadron reformed after the fight and proceeded to bomb its objective.   A direct hit was obtained on a large hut on the aerodrome ana a bomb fell on four enemy machines on the ground and destroyed them.NOTE,   There is no doubt that the Germans are largely increasing the numbers of their machines both in the interior and near the&apos; lino.   Fighting has been very heavy the last two days. The objective
12/13th August,of the squadron whicli bombed Hagonau this morning, was Fannheim but they were unable to get there owing to heavy fighting.Objectives      Hostile aerodromeTrainsAnti-aircraft batteries.

SITUATION A3 REGARDS GERM AIR SERVICE ON THE WESTERN FRONT FORTNIGHT ENDING - AUGUST 12th, 1918.Since the 12th August the following fresh movements and alterations in accommodation on the Battle Fronts have appeared:TLB FRQN	t&quot;-  T                      MOVEMENTS.

LIlie Sector*The total accommodation in this sector shews little change. The increase consists in the erection oi sheds, and tho decrease in the removal of hangars.In addition, two landing grounds, previously reported, show signs of further work, and five new landing grounds have &quot;been located, all in the forward area.Lens Sector.No change. St. Quentin Sector.This sector shews a total Decrease of hangars, amountingto 85:5 Aerodromes have already passed into our hands.   In the event of the enemy holding the ?e?-&apos;:iir.e-Ham-l!oyon line, it would involve the vacation of 35 aerodromes.ENEMY!S ATTZTUDJ.Aeroplane and Seaplane.The coast has shewn a good deal of activity both in Sea-planes and Aeroplanes.   The former have patrolled as far as the Norfolk and Suffolk coast, and. continue to patrol the Hcuth of the Thames *As might be expected, scout and reconnaissance activity shews a decrease on all other sectors except in the Somme Battle Area, where the enemy*s air forces have been endeavouring to prevent our low flying machines carrying out their duties, and to concentrate against our bombing formations.-Airships.The enemy air-ships shew an increased activity in waters liable to be patrolled by our own aircraft.   On the night of tho 5/6th a raid was attempted by 5 eirships on the East Coast of England.   One airship was shot down by one of our pilots and destroyed, falling in flames into the sea.On the morning of the 11th, another  eppelin was destroyed by our aircraft 14 miles north of Ameland.Seaplane Carriers.Regular patrols aro still being carried out over the southern area of the entrance to the Kattegat, by seaplanes operating from seaplane carriers.GERMANY^.Gas Ifechinc GunInformation has been received concerning the &quot;Gas Machine Gun&quot; which, it is stated, Is in use on the Front in machines issued to the Jagdstaffoln.   This gun is double barrelled and is capable of firing 1400 rounds per minute.Pfals Trip lane-It is reported, that the Pfals works have produced a copy of the Pokker Triplane, which is fitted with a 160 h*p. Siemens Schuckcrt engine.   It will be known as the Pfala D.R.1*
Mamo-plane Seaplane,Further particulars received regarding this machine indicates that this is fitted with a highj that it has a speed cf ICO knots and a goed climb, with an air endurance of 5 hours approximately.AUSTRIA.Zeppelin Works.A company has been formed in Austria under the name of Zeppelin Iferft. which wculd appear to indicate the probability that the building of Zeppelins will be undertaken in Austria In the near future.Losses in German Aircraft. w.........*&quot;&quot;&quot;........i 1&quot; *.........1&quot;  1 &apos;*...........Aeroplanes .The tetal losses sustained by the enemy since the 21st March 1918 up to the 12th August 19IB, are1694   machines destroyed. 648 machines out of control.Total -   2342 machines.This figure probably Indicates about   if losses fromall causes.In respect to the abeve figures an Interesting document has been captured dated 7th June, 1918.W&apos;AH regiments hare repeatedly complained that low-flying enemy aerjplanes are not interfered with by ou* fighter machines.     In reply to these complaints, the Group points out that its resources in aircraft are Sc Low , and those available are so busily engaged on reconnaissance work, that they cannot also be .  expected to engage enemy machines carrying cut low reconnaissance over ouff lines&quot;.ENEMY POLICY.The following extracts are taken from a captured ioeument Issued by General Ludend^rff 24/6/18*&quot;Employment tf air forces in conjunction with operations onthe ground&quot;.&quot;The Higher Command has decided to direct and develop on a &quot;larger scale than heretofore,,the training of the Air Forces &quot;with a view to securing their co-operation In future offensives &quot;        Like all other troops, airmen should attack the enemy on &quot;the ground, with the object of causing casualties and of break-&quot;ing his moral.JJ       Apart from the work carried out by battle airmen during &quot;previous offensives over the battlefield itself, it is necessar &quot;to consider the engagement of the enemy1s reserves, which are
&quot;hastily being brought towards the-battle front from &quot;distances as a task of equal importance. &quot;Scouts, two-seater fighters and bombing machines should &quot;be methodically on this task.   Tho holding up for an &quot;hour, 01 even half-an-hour, of the enemy1s troop   trains &quot;or motor transport and troop columns by the Air Service &quot;may have a greater influence on the ibsuo of a battle &quot;than shooting down a greater or smaller number of enemy &quot;machines,   Every airman should constantly bear this in &quot;mind.   The essential condition for success is tho engageoBn &quot;of numerically auperior   fighting forces. The Higher &quot;Command will see to this&quot;.&quot;kicvernents by Rail.&quot;     Disturb all traffic on certain lines for long periods by the following means ;*&quot;(i)   Night-bombing raids by several flights and groups of &quot;Giant aeroplanes, placed under one command, on railway &quot;Junctions.&quot;     Bombs should be dropped at short intervals on the &quot;same objective by all machines,&quot;(ii(Night attacks carried out by single two-seater &quot;machines belonging to bombing squadrons, flying at low &quot;heights, on trains and convoys en route.&quot;     Attacks by day, carried out by the same machines, as &quot;far as our mastery of the air will permit.&quot;Movements on roads,&quot;     The engagement of motor buses and columns of enetay &quot;reserves on the march in order to prevent their arrival &quot;on the battlefield,....,&quot;      I ask you to start work at onco, in order that pursuit, &quot;battle and bombing squadrons may be &quot;specially propared &quot;with a view to their employment as outlined above&quot;,&quot;      The G.O-.C,, Air Forces, will issue such additional &quot;instructions as he may consider necessary to the Commanders &quot;of Aviation at Groups of Armies, and Armies&quot;,(Signed)    Ludendorff.

This activity has, however,been almost entirely confined to flights behind the enemy&apos;s lines. On two nights only - namely, the nights of the lOth-llth and the 11th-12th have they been located over our lines.   On both these occasions they are   believed to have taken part in the.raids, which have been reported to have taken place on Dunkirk,On the night of the lOth-llth an enemy five-engineu Giant machine was brought down North of Amiens by one of our machines. The machine fell in flames and part of her load of bombs exploded as she struck the ground;   it i3 consequently impossible, at present, to identify her.The engines were 275 H.P.. Maybach. .Bombing activity.The forward areas between Merville and Arras have beencontinuously bombed.   As many as 40 places have been bombed in this Area,Albert Area has also received numerous raid3.The rear lines of communication have been bombed as follows:-   Dunkirk twice, Calais thrice, Boulogne twice, Etaples thrice, and Montreuil once.OTHER FRONTS.ITALY.Now Units from other theatres of war have appeared on the Italian Front as follows:-One Reconnaissance from VOLHYNIAOno Pursuit Company not previously identified.One Reconnaissance Company, sector and dutiesnot previously identified. Four Bombing Flights not previously identified,
This makes an Increase of 24 Reconnaissance Ma chines mis iiiw-A^D c ^ Pursuit Machines,24 Bombing machines.Tttal    64 Machines,all of which ,have appeared in the Venetian Sector, together with one Pursuit Company from the Trentine Sectcr.Ne further information is yet to hand concerning the presence rf German Air Forces&apos; -on the Italian Front.PALESTINE.-For the week ending August 3rd, enemy air actirity wasthe lowest recorded, especially in the vicinity of Jericho and Nablus-this may toe explained by an unconfirmed report that aeroplanes arebeing railed northwards.mhe following German Air Force is located to date:-6 Reconnaissance flights Q 14 machines - 84 machines 2 Pursuit Flights $ 14 machines, - 28 mauhine3.1 Pursuit Flight $ 18 machines - 18 machines.Total      130 machines.Bt is known that all unit3 on this front are considerably under es-tablishment, and the total enemy strength is estimated cn the 9th August as being 61 machines    a3 against 54 machines at the beginning, of March. &quot;SALONIKA.follows I-The enemy forces on the Salonika Front are composed as4 German ReconnsL ssance Flights - 24 machines2 Bulgarian      n                 w - 12 machines,2 Pursuit Flights.              . -24   machines.Tetal 60 machines.Ajq   accurate estimate pn this front is difficult as few identifications are made.   The actual strength estimated on the 9th August is 88 machines.    This Front has shown no change during the last fivTmo&amp;ths.MESOPOTAMIA.The estimated strength is now considered to be 28 machines as against 38 at the beginning of March 1916.RUSSIAMurmansk Expeditionary Force.The presence of. a few aeroplanes has been reported on the coast of Murmansk, but so   far net verified by cur seaplanes, but it is thought quite likely that aeroplanes will put in an appearance at Kern and Scjbctskaya.CAUCASUS.It is considered that a further reinforcement of two seater machines will be despatched shortly to the 28th, Reconnaissance Flight at Tlflis.   The arrival of these machines is probably in con-junction with the Turkisk movement in the   vicinity of Baku,

TECHNICAL   DEPARTMENTAeroplanes,The undercarriage of the Bristol Bomber, having proved to be weak while the machine wag beinr; tried on the Aerodrome, is now being strengthened by fitting extra radius rods. This work should be &quot;complete in a few days and the machine will then be flown.The design of the new Bristol Fighter is proceeding.The second V type Handley Page did not fly during the period under review, i.e. to August 10th; the machine being held up pending the fitting of a fin and other modifications. The new type of control has been satisfactorily tested on an 0.400 machine.\*his machine flew on 11th August and has made subsequent flights at the contractors works. The Contractor reports the machine as in ivery way satisfactory.)The D.H,10,wjfcth the new engine mounting is now complete and is about to be tested at Hartlesham, after which, if satisfactory,it will be put into production. This modification increases the performance to some extent.Parnell Panther Ship aeroplane is now ready for production including various modifications required by the ServicecThe ilartinsyde F.4. with the 300 Eispano is entering into production. It is beim; fitted with self-sealing tanks and the petrol capacity has been increased, giving 3 hours instead of 2f. The machine will   take the Eagle Rolls, if necessary. Experiments are also being;carried out with this machine with petrol for 6 hours.Engines.Good progress is- &quot;bein/? made with the crankcase modifications on the 10c.I (Arab) Engine.The engine to be used for the 600-600 H.P. class will t*e decided on next week. The available engines are the Condor (Rolls), Ti &amp;r (Siddeley), Atlantic (Galloway), Fiat,Lorraine-Districti and Renault.The aew modified gear wheels for the   Liberty engines are now coming through and are being fitted into machines at Xenley. An officer of the Technical Department is visiting Squadrons where Liberty engines are in use.Design.Experiments are being carried out on a Camel fitted with monoplane wings. Tests are not yet complete.
