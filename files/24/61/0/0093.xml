MCL03URE I, PROPAGANDA I IT aEtE COUNTRIES REPORT 01? THE POLICY COIvlXITTEE.The Committee On Policy has held three sittings, and is happy to report that though its labours have been long, they have been so harmonious that the statement of its. conclusions can be camparatively brief,   the Chairman made it clear at :;the outset that while he and &quot;his colleagues would, do every-thing in their power to recommend to their Governments what-ever resolutions the Committee might adopt, their acceptance if those resolutions would necessarily be aci referendum, and not immediately binding Upon their Governments,   in the discussion which followed, it was recognised that this , position was identical with that of the other members if the Ccmmittee,&apos;and that it was in fact analogous to tho position which Lord NirthCliffe had always taken up in regard to the British Government *   It was also recognised that while effective propaganda in enemy countries presupposes a clear policy in regard to each of the countries concerned, it would be futile and dangerous for propagandists ta lay down and to proclaim their own policy without reference to the diplomatic, military and naval.authorities through whose efforts policy can alone be ,-made operative.   Any other pro-cedure-would involve the risk of confusion, contradiction and consequent inefficiency.The recognition of this fundamental principle does not in the least impair the value of propagandists as pioneers in the work of suggesting to their respective Governments lines *f policy which might fruitfully be adopted. On the contrary, it may relieve responsible statesmen of much work of detail, and permit cf a.;mcrc rapid formulation of tenative solutions of political problems than might otherwise be practicable.   It had always been Lord Horthcliffe*s , intention that when any line of policy laid by him before the Government had&quot;been sanctioned as a basis for propaganda, the British Government should ask Allied Governments to.assent to it, so that there might be definite co-ordination of Allied propaganda policy, if not indeed absolute Unanimity. For various reasons, the&apos; work of co-ordination by this method, had proceeded very slowly, and it had become evident that more rapid co-ordination mi $it be attained through the instrumentality of such inter-Allied gatherings as the present. Inter-Allied propaganda Conferences are, in fact an esten-sion to the wtrk of co-ordination of the same method which has been found valuable in the preparation of British pro-paganda policy.   Such conferences prepare the ground for the action of Allied Governments and submit to them in a tangible form resolutions and recommendations which, can be sanctioned, modified cr rejected.In regard to propaganda against Austria-Hungary, the Committee found itself in complete agreement with the. scheme of policy sanctioned by tho British Government for purposes *f propaganda, and amplified by the decisions of tfoe British, French, and Italian Governments at the time of, or in connection with, the Rome Congress of Oppressed Austro--Hungarian Nationalities.   It recognised that such extensions of policy, while springing from considerations of Allied Principles had in part corresponded to the real demands of the propaganda situation, which, in their turn, had sprung from the exigencies of the military situation, and in particular from the necessity of utilising the established
butprinciples of the alliance for the purpose of impeding or hampering the Austro-Hungarlan offensive against Italy. 1Subsequent acts and declarations on the part of Allied Governments and of the Government of the United States made it clear that the joint policy of the Allies was tending increasingly towards the constructive liberation of the subject Austro-IIungarian races.   The main task of the Committee in relation to propaganda in Auatria^Itagary thorofore scorned to bo one unifying for propaganda purposes these various acts and declarations, and of preparing if possible, the way for a joint Allied declaration that might complete and render more effective the work of Allied propaganda both in the interior of Austria-Hungary and among Austro-Hungarian troops at the front,$he discussion open the expedience and the possibility of such a joint Allied declaration was exhaustive and illuminating,    in view of,the position already taken up by the Allied Governments and by the United States in regard to the Czecho-Slcvaks, the l-oleo and the Rumanians, it appeared that the main issueasvaiting definition concerned the question of Jugoslav unity and independence and of the attitude of Italy towards them.   The Chief Italian delegate, Professor Borgese, made in this respect an eloquent and convincing contribution to the knowledge of the Committee, He dealt at length with the Yugoslav question in its Italian aspects, and emphasized the desirability from the point of view of Italo-Yugoslav agreement that the Yugoslav Ctmmittee in Allied Countries should do its utmost to prevent the Yugoslav Press outside Austria, and as far as possible within Austria, from raising controversial questions of territory and of the delimitation of frontiers which are bound to react unfavourably uprn Italian public opinion.     His arguments in this respect form the subject of a special recommendation which the Committee has adopted for eventual communication to the Yugoslav Committee,   It runs.......With reference to tho best means of aiding Allied propaganda in-favour of the freedom of the Austro-Hungarian-subject races, the Committee expresses a strong hope that all controversial discussions of the frontiers between Italy and tlip future Yugoslav State will bo avoided by the Yugoslav Press and the Yugo-Slav leaders both outside and as far as the Yugoslav leaders may be able to exert their influence, also inside, the Austrc-Hungarian Monarchy, just as they have been avoided of late by the most important organs cf the Italian press and in the public speeches of influential Italian leaders.Professor Borgese also submitted, and the Committee unanimously adopted the following rcsolution;-In order to secure stronger and better coordinated propaganda among Austro-Hungarian nationalities, the &apos;present Conference expresses its desire that at the next inter-Allied Conference on propaganda in Enemy Countries representa-tives of the national Councils of the Oppressed Nationalities should be admitted to the technical committees of the ConferenceDuring the debate upon this recommendation and this resolution,, it became clearly apparent that the committee regards, and is confident that the Cf^nference will regard, the Italian national claims to the union with Italy of the cities and regions of Trent. Trieste, and the other regions of Italian character, as not only entirely justified
but as an elementary dictate of the allies&apos; respect for the principles of nationality and of ethnical justice.   Precisely because the Committee Supports the principles formulated in the I talc-Yugoslav Agreement of last March, and see.b in them the basis of fruitful cooperation between Italy, Yugoslavia and the other nationalities, now oppressed, of the Au*tro-Hungarian Monarchy, it holds the Italian national rignts above-mentioned to be imprescriptible and not open to discussion.!The Committee also felt that both for reason of propaganda and from the point of view of the future independence and moral and political secruitiee Of the Italian nation, a foremost part in the work of creating a free and united Yugo-Slav State naturally falls to Italy.     It has, therefore, after the most careful 60nsideration, unanimously adopted -and it recommends to the Conference - the following resolution.Considering the adhesion of the Italian Government by the Prime Minister&apos;s speech of April 1918, to the resolutions of the Rome Congress of Austro-Hungarian subject races (which embodied the agreement between the Yugo-Slavs and the Italian Committee) and by his recent telegram to the Prime .Minister of Serbia, M. Pashitch;Considering the exemplifications of Allied policy towards Austria-Hungary in the French and Italian Conventions which with the Caecho-Slovaks National Council, the British Declaration recognising the Czecho-Slovaks as an Allied nation, the Allied declaration at the Versailles Conference of.June 3, 1918, in favour of the unity and independence of Poland, and Mr. Lansing&apos;s statement of June 28, that all branches of the Slav race should be completely freed from German and. Austrian rule;Considering further the extreme expediency especially in view of possible military developments on the Italian front, that the al3led policy of liberating the oppressed Hapsburg peoples should be represented, in the first place, by Italy ori whose front allied propaganda against Austria-Hungary is principally located;The Policy Committee of the Tnter-Allied propaganda Conference resolves to suggest that the Italian Government take the initiative in promoting a joint and unanimous public declaration that all the allies regard the establishment of a free and united Yugoslav State, embracing the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, as one of the conditions of a just and lasting peace and of the rule of right in Europe.BULGARIA.The Committee recognised the essential connection between allied propaganda policy towards Austria-Hungary and allied propaganda policy in the Balkans.     Vithout the adoption by the allied Governments of a definite policy in regard to Yugoslav.and Rumanian unity and independence it is impossible to formulate any effective propaganda policy in regard to Bulgaria.    Upon the merits of propaganda in Bulgaria the Committee unanimously adheres to the principles laid down in Lord Northcliffe1s opening statement, that is to say, -that an essential preliminary to any conversations or negotiations with Bulgaria must be a complete and effective reversal of the policy hitherto pursued by Bulgaria as the enemy of the allies; and that until this reversal has taken
place, the objects of allied propaganda should bo to bringhome to the Bulgarian people a sense of the clangers that threatenthem unless they can convince the allies by their conductof their sincere repentenco.   Tho Committee is rIso of opinionthat, pending this   necessary charge, our Serbian and Greekallies should not be left in ignorance of a propaganda policywhich the chief allied powers may adopt.The discussion upon the propaganda policy to bo followed in regard to Germany was preceded by a consideration of the questions of Poland end of Alsace-Lorraine,    Upon the former question the Chairman made a brief but pregnant statement, declaring the policy of propaganda in regard to the Poles to be identical with that laid down by President Wilson and President Poincare,, and formulated by the ollied Prime Ministers at the Versailles Conference of June 3 in the words, &quot;the creation of a united and independent Polish State with free access to the sea constitutes one of the conditions of a solid and just peace and of the rule of right in Europe.&quot;   He added that the growth of Prussian power for evil and the present position of Prussia in the world had their origin in the partition of Poland, consequently he urged that the reunion of the various parts of Poland would be not only the reparation of an historical injustice, but would constitute a strong guarantee against any revival of the Prussian system.   He claimed that the greater the strength of Poland the firmer would be the security of Europe and the world against any renewal of aggressive Prussian militarism.In the discussion which followed general agreement was expressed with this view; but it was pointed out that a reunited Poland might be stronger in proportion as its territory was ethnographically&apos;. compact and did not include other neighbouring racial elements with whom Poland would have every interest to live in concord, but which, were they included against their will within her frontiers, might become sources of disturbance and weakness.   It wa3 also considered desirable that the Polish National Committee in order to become not less valuable to the Allies as an adjunct and agency of propaganda in enemy countries than are the Czech and Yugoslav Committees, might extend the basis of its representation, so as to secure more unanimous support from the various sections of Polish opinion.   The Committee adopted and submits to the approval of the Conference the following resolution and recommendation.   It would propose to communicate the recommendation to the Polish National Commit tee:-The Conference records its conviction that the creation of a united and independent Polish State with free access to the sea is an essential requirement of lasting peace in Europe, and expresses the belief that the more closely the frontiers of this future Polish State follow ethnographical lines, the stronger will it be to play Its part in safeguarding that peace, and the more harmonious will be its relations with neighbouring peoples which, like the Poles, are striving to secure a free existence.The Conference, anxious that allied propaganda may truly express the desires of the Polish people as a whole and may tend to promote its welfare, expresses the hope that the Polish National Council may extend the basis of its represen-tation so as to be in a position to lend still fuller ;aid to allied propaganda in enemy countries.,-
(C 0 hiPassing to the consideration of the question of Alsace Lorraine, the Committee found itself in entire agreement with its Chairman&apos;s declaration, that the return of the two provinces to Prance is an imperative demand of international justice, and not a concession to be made by the allies to French national feeling.     The undoing of the flagrant wrong done by Germany in 1871 is so clearly a condition of any just peace, that it required no further demonstration, quite apart from the historical justification of the French claim to the re incorporation Of these provinces in France by their disannexation from Germany, the title of the people of Alsace Lorraine to determine their own allegiance proceeds from their voluntary adhesion to France in 1790 no less than from the protests of their elected representatives against the Treaty of Frankfurt in the French national Assembly at Bordeaux in 1871, and in the German Reichstag in 1874,   In regard to Alsace Lorraine the Committee is convinced that allied propaganda in Germany shoutld make known to the German people the determination of the allies to insist in all circumstances upon this vindica-tion of rights.Consequently it makes the following recommendations(l) Propaganda on the subject of Alsace Lorraine should be unified and conducted on general lines indicated by France,(2) The argument to which first place should always be given is that of outraged right and of the will of the inhabitants as expressed in their solemn and repeated protests.(3) The question of Alsace Lorraine is a question of International rights, the solution of which interests the whole world.As to propaganda addressed to the German people themselves in regard to the future position of Germany, the Committee is in full agreement with the policy recommended by Lord Northcliffe with the approval of the British Government and summarised in his opening statements.   It believes that allied propaganda should make it clear that the chief object of the allies is the changing of Germany, not the destruction of the German people; and that the German people can hope for an adequate position in the world and for admission into a future society of nations, when they have qualified them-selves for partnership with civilised communities by making tho necessaty reparations and restorations, (primarily in the case of Belgium) by overthrowing the system known as Prussian militarism, and when they have effectively abandoned all designs of mastery over Europe.     At the same time the Committee lays stress upon the importance of bringing home to the German people a sense of the overwhelming and economic pressure which the allies, and in particular the United States of America are in a position to exercise and will exernise, until the conditions of a just peace are accepted^To this end the Committee strongly urges that, in the various allied countries and in the United States, a comprehensive scheme of world organisation be studied and worked out, and that, in particular, the steps already t.Ucen to coordinate the economic policy of the allies and of the United States be publicly explained and brought to the knowledge of the Germans.     The Committee has therefore .
adopted and recommends to the Conference the following resolution .......In consideration of the fact that tho Allied Governments have in their own respective fields of action and by their joint action begun to give effect to economic co-operation which is to-day a powerful instrument of war, and which may, after the war,  serve as a banis for the systematic organisation of the resources of the world ;The Conference expresses its satisfaction with the results already attained, and believes that it would be expedient to make plain to enemy public opinion, by means i-f a service of information which would set forth both the principles cf Allied economic action and their results as worked out in daily practice, the gravity cf the danger by which the enemy is threatened and the advantages assured to those who are admitted to co-operation with the Allies.Upon the necessity of co-ordinating Allied policy and meant, of securing unanimity, and in regard to manifesta-tions of policy by (a) official declarations,&apos; and (b) corgr resses: -The Committee has adopted the following resolutionThat in view of w- ;,reat importance of co-ordinating the Allies&apos; policies ana organisation:.? for the conduct of propaganda in enemy countries, a permanent body &quot;be con-stituted for this purpose.That this body consist of four members representing respectively the four propaganda departments which have taken part in this Conference; each member having the power to nominate an assistant or a substitute or both if necessary.That the provisional headquarters of the body shall be at Cre^e House, London, until permanent headquarters be determined;That the establishment expenses be shared equally between the four Governments; andThat a permanent secretariat be appointed, thereto.In adhering to this resolution and in deciding that it be recommended for adoption by the Allied Governments and by the United States, the Policy Committee has been influence^ especially by the hope that the proposed arrange ment may expedite the co-ordination of Allied propaganda policy, facilitate the preparation of concordant declara-tions by the Allied Governments at suitable moments and assist in the proper organisation of congresses such as the second congress of the oppressed Austro-Hungarian nationali ties which it is intended to held in Paris.In
In regard to the date of this congress, the Policy Committee is of opinion that it should be held at the beginning of October in order to allow time for the congress to be given a solemn and representative character.

M     1     0     W9 o r &amp; 0 JPRQPAGAHUA III EEEI.Y COUNTRIES, RLPOETOE DISTRIBUTION COMMITTEE(a) I,; I L IT L   YiTho Committee examined and considored the various methods in use, or suggested, for the distribution of propaganda over enemy linos&apos;.It was found that the Italians employed aeroplanes, projectiles, and contact patrols; tho French aeroplanes, projectiles and balloons; the British only balloons on tho Western Front, but aeroplanes in the East; and that seaplanes might be employed to reach special objectives in the Mediterranean,,Each country gave favourable reports on the methods they employed, but all wore agreed that a constant exchange of information as to results was required.In certain cases, such as ^ho mountainous Italian front, where very limited targets had to be reached, tho dropping of propaganda in built was necessary; but in most cases methods&quot; that so euro d a wide scattering of tho leaflets, so that these might be secured and hidden by individuals, was necessary.   The Eronch explained a device, now in its experimental stage, to secure an automatic scattering -from aeroplanes.   Tho &quot;releases&quot; of English balloons wore agreed to produce&quot; a most adequate scattering.     Various devices employed in projectiles were successful in the case of leaflets when the angle of projection was high and the wind was favourable, but hitherto had not been successful with pamphlets.It was recognised that aeroplanes were, at present, the best means of, reaching distant targets with accuracy; that for shorter distances, from a few hundred yards up to ten miles, projectiles would secure great accuracynWith regard to rangej it was racoOTisod that aeroplanes had tho widest limits, and the scattering of lo^ai-atu^o    in Berlin by the French, and in Vienna by the Italians, were considered accomplishments of great brilliancy and promise of usefulness, and that the present types of paper balloons were thoroughly effective for ranges up to twenty or thirty miles, though with less certainty of aim up to 100 or 1.50 miles; but that with larger balloons (such as the fabric balloons at present in tho possession of the English, or the new -large d &apos;.dtfeJ/balloons now being prepared in England, or the reinforced paper balloons being experimented with in franco&apos;) the distances could be increased to several hundred&apos;miles.,With regard to the bulk that could be distributed, it was stated that each of the present standard balloons, as used by the English and Erench, carried 4 lb. 2 ok, of literature, and that projectiles could take from a few ounces up to 8 or 9 lbs,   The large fabric balloons, now available at &apos;GeH,QM could carry up to 15 lbs.The French, by their various methods, had distributed 25 million leaflets since last December, the British on the Western front over 8 millions in the last four months, and the Italians very large numbers, of which exact particulars&apos;were not available, the capability being up to a million a day, and depending on political circumstances.
It was recognised that there were no objections to the use of balloons, as the operations did not interfere with other work and did not excite retaliation from the enemy.   The use of projectiles was apt to provoke retaliation unless it were carried out at night or to a limited extent.There was difference of experience and opinion with regard to the use of aeroplanes.     The Italians and French stated that no ac-tion had been taken by the enemy in the case of their aviators who had boon captured, and that they found no difficulty in imposing this duty on their airmon.The British stated that the German,had taken strong measures, and had threatened their continuance, again?t aviators captured after distributing leaflets.   The reprosentativi  of the British Air Ministry stated that, after givinr full consideration to the matter, and notwithstanding their appreciation of the value of propaganda, they were opposed to the use of aeroplanes for tMs purpose partly on the ground of the bad psychological effect of such work on young pilots and aviators, and partly because the supply of trained men and of machines was no more than sufficient for the direct purposes of this arm of the Forces.The representative of the G.H.Q.., France, stated that the British Army had. accepted this view.   He added that balloons could be employed on the Western Front throe days a week on the average, and that there was no mechanical reason why the method by balloons could not be increased to meet every reasonable requirement.A French representative in the course of a discussion as to the utility of throwing some leaflets in bombing expeditions, reported the opinion of a well-known pro-ally German citizen that in the case of the Rhine towns and rich cities of Germany, the propaganda of fear, that Is to s-y, the actual dropping of bombs, was more useful -especially at present - than the dropping of literature,It was agreed that the suggested use of aeroplanes to scatter leaflets at great heights parallel with the enemy linos encountered most of the objections to, and none of the dangers of their direct use by crossing the lines,A device, which has been working out experimentally in England, but not employed because of the danger it might occasion to aeroplanes, was.explained and the apparatus was shotm.   It consisted in sending up leaflets to be liberated at the necessary height for wind driftage by means&apos;of a messenger travelling up and down the cable of a box kite.     This means was recognised to be cheap and efficient for em-ployment where it would, not be dangerous to aeroplanes.The Committee agreed that the regular exchange of information as&apos; to methods employed -by the Allies, said as to the results actually obtained by these, would be of great value, and recommended that a permanent bureau should be established to collect and exchange such information and reports.Signed: , ,G.

EEOLCSURE II (Oontd.) U0 &apos;PROPAGANDA   IE , HE Y   COMTEIES,, REPORT   OP   DISTRIBUTION   CQtii ITTEEM.(To)  ,LV,I..L,&apos;The Committee considered&apos;: -(a) The moans &quot;by which the Enemy public can be informed,and its opinion influenced by action in and through Keutral Countries,  and(b) The Countries available as bases of operations.The Committee agreed to present the following recommendations to the Conference. (Except where otherwise expressly notcd, those recommendations were unanimous)(1)     In tho opinion of the Com.- it tee, the Neutral press, and especially the German-Swiss press, is one of the most effective vehicles for conveying facts and ideas to the Enemy Public.     The Committee recommends that increased attention he paid to the insertion of news and articles in Neutral organs which are either read or quoted in the Enemy Countries.   Special stress is laid on the importance of establishing effective relations with organs which have a reputation for strict neutrality cr pro-Enemy bias.(2)     The Committee attaches special importance to per-scnal propaganda among eminent neutrals, whether in the Military, political, Journalistic, Literary, Financial, or Easiness World, whose views rre likely to re-act on Enemy opinion.    The Committee feels that this most valuable field of activity is one which calls in a special degree for inter-Allied co-operation,    In each country.a survey should be made of the personalities whom it is worth while to take into account,  and such individuals should then be allotted to the agents of the respective rowers,  according to the suitability of the persons concerned,  and the. means of contact available, . In this way we should provide ourselves with the means of scour-ing that all such personalities come within the orbit of salutary personal intercourse.     The Diplomatic Missions of the Allied powers should be encouraged to devote themselves more system-atically to this work, in which their eminent position enables thorn to take a most useful share. Experience, moreover,  having shown that in suit-able cases very satisfactory results have beenobtainedfOTE:- The American Representative (Captain Hob.or- Blankenhorh) refrained from voting on the ground that he att nded in the capacity of observer only,.
- T6obtained by getting Neutrals - including men of pro-Enemy tendencies&apos; - to visit Allied Countries, the Committee considers that, subject to the observance of the usual pre-cautions and proper discrimination, such visits are as useful in the interests of Enemy, as of Neutral propaganda.The Committee recommends intensive, propaganda among Enemy subjects permanently or temporarily resid-ent in Neutral Countries, and draws particular attention to the desirability of utilising the services of Enemy subjects already imbued with either pro-Allied conviction or with Hevolution-ary tendencies.The Committee recommends that each Power should seek through its agencies to establish channels through which Enemy newspaper correspondents can be influenced or provided with information.   The task of approaching all sufficiently-important correspondents, with whom contact has not yet been established,  should be apportioned among the agencies of the powers, according to the oppor-tunities of approach available.     Channels created under a scheme of this kind should be made mutually available to the respective Allied agents in the localities concerned.Having regard to the extent to which the ordinary Book Trade channels into Germany are still ^operating, the Committee recommends thepubiic-ation in Neutral Countries of works which, though not directly bearing on tho issues of the War, are expressly calculated to educate Enemy opinion in a democratic sense.The Committee holds that, in view of its great util-ity, clandestine circulation in the Enemy Countries of carefully chosen literature, es-pecially if actually written by Enemy subjects of pro*-Alliod or Revolutionary tendencies, should be secured through every available channel.   In * view of the precarious and delicate nature of this work, the Committee desires specially to emphasise the necessity of seeking out and developing new channels for distribution of this kind.The Committee further considered other forms of activity, including the organisation and support of Revolutionary bodies of Enemy Subjects, Contact &apos;Work on the Enemy Frontiers, the feeding of the Enemy Intelligence Collecting Centres, and the utilisation of agents in Enemy Countries, and endorsed the employment of these methods as circumstances permit or require.The Committee recommends that the Associated Powers should energetically promote the establishmentof
The Committee recommends that the possibilities cf Russia as a base of operations for Enemy Propaganda should be investigated, without delay..Signed :-  .&apos;G. VICING PALLAVICINO, Captain.

- 15 ENCLOSURE 111*PROPAGANDA IF ENEMY COUNTRIES *REPORT OF JEJ.......COMMITTEE ON MATERIAL,.-The main part of the time (five hoars) whioh. the Committee gave to the discussion of its subject was devoted to the questions of the most effective forms of propaganda and to the special methods desirable for putting, these forms into practice. There was general agreement that the best way to depress the morale of the German troops and the German population was to shew them that it was against their interest to continue the war: , that the longer they went on the- worse they would fare both during the war and after;   and that their only hope of regaining their place in the community of nations lay in throwing over the bad advisers who had led them into the war, and whose repeated, promises of success had been one after the ether falsified.   Up to now the Germans have always had a hope before them.   They were taught to hope for great advantage from the downfall of Russia, from the unrestricted U-boat waifare, from the offensive on tie Western Front which began last March,   Now, for the first time, their leaders do not know what hope to dangle before them.   Therefore the moment is one peculiarly favourable for propaganda if it is undertaken upon the right lines. -It appeared to the Committee that the best lines upon which to work at present&quot;would be to emphasise as much as possible the great American effort, both in the field and at home in the factory, the shipyard and the farm.   At the same time the dark&apos;commercial outlook for Germans, the dangers lying latent for them in the control of raw materials by the Allies,  the discovery of so many cf their trade secrets, and the building up in France, Italy, England, and the United States, of industries in which they had almost a monopoly before the war,&apos; ou $it also to be brought as vividly as possible before, them.   They should, be tola the truth about the food situation in France and England which.so far has been kept from them.   They should be given news as quickly as possible cf Allied successes. &apos; They should.be depressed as much as possible, yet at-the same time care should be.taken not to let them think that they are for ever excluded from relations of business andiliendship with the peoples now fighting against them.   If they are made to believe this,  their backs would be stiffened, to fight on desperately as long as possible,   A sound line of propaganda, the Committee considered, is to leave open a doorway through which, if they get rid of Pan-Germanism and renounce its theories of world domination by blood and iron, they will in time be admitted again to the same intercourse as before.   It was agreed that for soldiers the most elementary propaganda was the best.   More elaborate arguments and demonstrations should be kept for pamphlets to be smuggled into Germany and for articles in neutral papers.   Use should be made, wherever possible,  of diagrams appealing instantly to the eye *A long discussion took place on the question of revulu-tionary propaganda.   The opinion was expressed that it was better to denounce tho pan-German Party generally, and throv upon them the responsibility for the war and for all the
misfortunes which Germany has suffered and will suffer from it, rather than to attack the Emperor.   On the other hand, it was pointed out that attacks on an individual are always more effective than attacks, on a party.   Einally it was agreed that anything said against the Hohenzollem dynasty should he taken, either in reality or in appearance,ftfom German sources so as to avoid, the risk that attacks clearly emenating from Allied sources might strengthen rather than weaken the Emperor&apos;s hold upon the people of Germany.   While a good deal of material is available from German anti-imperial sources, it was suggested that the advantage of circulating,  for example,  speeches of Socialists might he counterbalanced by the disadvantage that it would make such speakers leas inclined to talk.   Some Socialists have appealed to the Ere rich Government not to use their speeches for propaganda because this weakened their efforts.   It was agreed that incitements to German soldiers to desert were legitimate, and might be useful.   The sending into Germany of photographs of prisoners of war taken immediately after their capture, when they are usually in a deplorable condition, and after two months of capticity when their physical condition is good, was recommended.   As it appeared that there were in the German Army many soldiers anxious to try their luck in a new country instead of going back to Germany, it was also proposed that the inducement cf facilities for emigration to the American and other Continents might be held out to the.men who come over within a. certain time,With regard to Austria-Hungary,  the Committee dis-cussed. whether it was legitimate to exploit the land hunger among the Magyar peasants and the discontent among the German proletariat.   It was agreed that it would do no harm to support the agrarian agitators in Hungary, but, as regards Bolshevik, propaganda among the Austro-German working classes, that we ou$it only to circulate their own literature.   Dr. Seton-Watson suggested that the United States, in mobilising its Slav elements, might spare members of each of the Slav nationalities for propaganda work in England and in prance; and Mr. Keeley undertook to see Whether this could be done.Propaganda in Bulgaria depends upon the policy which the Entente Powers and the United States decide to follow with regard to that country.   Until such a policy is settled little can be done in a large way.   It is useful, however, to make the Bulgarians acquainted with a number of facts of which they are ignorant, for example,  the failure of U-boats to reduce England to the verge of starvation, the large number cf American troops already incfn trice, n,nd so on.   Leaflets on these and other topics are Oexng dropped regularly by aeroplanes on the Salonika Front in considerable quantities. A good deal, it was suggested, can be done through Bulgars ill Switzerland.   But ao long as the&apos;Bulgarians believe that the United States is their friend and will see them through whatever happens, little impression can be made upon them.V/ith regard to co-operation between the various bodies engaged in   propaganda, it was proposed-by General le Vicomte de la Panouse that closer relations should be established between the local agents of the Allied Powers in neutral countries;   that they should meet from time to time to exchange ideas and to give each other full information as to their
activities, .. General de la Panouse laid special stress upon the necessity of these local agents working in union with the diplomatic and military representatives and with any other agencies engaged in the same kind, of work.   Emphasis was also laid upon this by Signor Emanuel.     The Committee unanimously accepted this suggestion, with the proviso that the local agents should, if possible,, he under the direction of a central committee to which they could refer for instructions and advice, . Signor Emanuel proposed that, pending the establishment of such a central body, the various Propaganda Departments should begin at once to exchange information about all that they are $oing and that, each should send out copies of all the material produced by it to the other Departments,     This was accepted and measures adopted for the carrying out of the suggestion immediately.   It was, of course, agreed that such circulation of material produced would be one of the chief activities of the proposed central body which would do it with greater rapidity and effect.It was also agreed that such a central body could be most useful in employing methods for testing the effectiveness of propaganda.. The means of doing this at present were generally admitted to be defective..   Only by co-ordinating effort and hy comparing information could they be improved.   It was decided that the present system of examining prisoners of war for purposes of military information ought to be supplemented more than it is at present by a special further examination, for the purposes of propaganda information, and it was suggested that special representatives of the Enemy Propaganda-Depart-, meats should be allowed.to conduct such examinations,.Some important points connected with propaganda brought to bear upon Germany through neutral countries were raised, by Mr, Keeley, and it was agreed that the work of controlling and distributing films for moving picture theatres, which is to be done by an Inter-Allied Commission in Switzerland, ought to be extended to other neutral countries, especially Sweden. Mr, Keeley said his information was to the effect that   German-, owned picture theatres had of late increased very much in number,.both in.Switzerland and in Scandinavia, and that these relied for the lighter part of their entertainments upon films from allied countries, Germany supplying special propaganda films.   By controlling the supply of films from allied countries,, the activities of these theatres could be very much diminished and possibly brought to an end.Another of Hr. Eeeley/s proposals, which the Committee adopted, was that it would be advisable to invite a number of neutral editors and newspaper writers to pay a visit to the United States,   It was considered that articles describing what they saw and what they were able to judge of the feeling of the American nation would have a very useful effect upon German opinion.   General de la Panouse suggested that It would be as well for them also to see the American effort in Prance, which they couldy^asily on their way to or from the United otates.     It was agreed that the party should represent all shades of opinion,., and that representatives of pro-German newspapers should,, by no means,., be excluded,,  The suggestion might be made with useful effect that they should also pay a visit to Germany and describe what they saw there,with a view to influencing German opinion, it was suggested and agreed, that more use might be made of the Neue Ebrrespondenz flews Agency in Berne and that- similar news agenciesr to all appearance independent and self-supporting,might
