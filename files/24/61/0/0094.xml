i\ ^. r ^/Li&quot;;&apos; Pntannic fViaJosty^ Government.CONFIDENTIAL Political Intelligence Department,[August 15,1918.j Foreign Office,/^IT        ^v*\ I % M KMOEAND UM8WESTERN PROVINCES OF RUSSIA AND GERMANY.Relations under the Brest-Litovsk Treaty of the 3rd March, 191*.1. It is proposed in the first two sections of this Memorandum to give a brief account of action which has been taken during recent months by the Germans in contravention of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty in the Baltic Provinces of Russia, originally known as Esthonia, Livonia, and Courland,* and the districts which are generally designated by the expression Lithuania. (While under Russian rule there was no district or province to which the name Lithuania was given.)I. Esthonia and Livonia.2. Under the terms of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk of the 3rd March, 1918, between the Central Powers and Eussia, these districts fell into two categories. The first included Esthonia and Livonia. It is determined in the treaty that these pro-vinces &quot; shall be evacuated without delay by the Russian troops and Russian Eed Guards.&quot; They shall be occupied by a German police force until order is guaranteed by their own national institutions and State organisation.&apos;&apos; It is clear, therefore, that under the terms of the treaty the sole rights which accrue to Germany are those of a temporary police occupation for the maintenance of order.3. It is also to be noted that there is nothing in the treaty prejudicing the future international status of these territories; saving the clause by which the establish-ment of their own national institutions is mentioned, it is open to these provinces to return to their allegiance to Eussia, and this interpretation has been specifically endorsed in the Eeichstag by von dem Busche, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. According to the latest news, however (&quot; Daily Review,&quot; the 3rd August), &quot;the Soviet Government has agreed that Livonia and Esthonia shall be separated from Eussia. The result will probably be a change in the organisation of the territory occupied by the Germans.&quot;4. It is clear, then, that the German rights under the treaty are very closely limited. The occupation of the country is police, and not military; the object is merely the preservation of public order. Any action which goes beyond this is clearly a violation of the treaty. Under the treaty the Germans have less rights than a Power in military occupation of a country. Even during such an occupation, the Power in occupancy must respect &quot; at the same time, unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country.&quot; (Article 43 of the Regulations respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land: Hague Convention, 1907.) Accordingly, the tasks of the policing force are simply those prescribed by the constituent agreement. Notwith-standing this, the Germans have been daily transgressing these limitations, and have acted as if they had, in fact, full authority to determine the present government, and have been prejudicing the future settlement. Whilst on the one hand the Brest-Litovsk Treaties were deliberately drawn up ignoring the existence of other European Powers, who therefore, if the treaties held, would have no right of inter-ference or protest, the Germans have already regarded the parts of the Treaty of the. 3rd March which refer to Esthonia and Livonia as Cfa scrap of paper,&quot; as the following.summary of their activities shows.5. (a.) They have dissolved the independent self-governing body (the Esthonian National Council and Provisional Government), and have declared that the German military authorities constitute the only power in the country.(b.) They have dissolved all the democratic town councils, and have appointed temporary commissions in their place composed of Germans. The same course has been followed in the villages. It is clear that the dismissal of these bodies is accounted for, not by the absence cf order, but by reason of the German annexationistit.   po%-* For the more recent regrouping of these regions, see P.I.D. Memorandum, Russia, 007,[367-35] B
(c.) They have disarmed the few Esthonian troops who were the support of the Provisional Government in connection with the maintenance of order. In this way they have themselves transgressed that, order in support of which they came into the country.(d.) They have created, partly by direct appointment, a new Landesrat in, Riga, &amp;c, and have given no notice of abrogation of the laws which were in existence pre-vious to the German invasion. Yet they have destroyed the national unity of Esthonia created by the legal Russian Provisional Government (the 12th April, 1917), by rejoining the Esthonian districts of Livland to South Li viand, as was the case previous to the Russian Revolution. The creation of a new body, and the viola-tion of the &quot; laws in force,&quot; had no justification in the situation in the country.(e.) The introduction of the German language in the schools, and also the prohibition of the use of the Esthonian and Russian languages, have nothing in common with the German task as a policing force during their temporary presence in the country.(/.) The Germanisation of Dorpat University merely by decree of a Divisional Commander (Lieutenant-General Adams), is an act without parallel in history. (Text of the decree: &quot; The University of Dorpat is a German University,&quot; &amp;c.) This attempt at regulation of an already existing, purely scientific and educational body has nothing in common with the policing o? the country.(g.) The general requisitioning of live stock, &amp;c, made in a country already stricken with famine is inhuman, and the Germans are violating international law, not only in support of their occupational forces, but also for export.(h.) Their suppression of the whole local system for the maintenance of order, established in accordance with the wishes of the population, is a new violation of their duties as police.(i.) The arrests and executions of workmen are intolerable and unjustifiable, and would be so even in the event of a rising directed towards the expulsion of the Germans, since the country is not under martial law, but under the ordinary statute law and ordinary police, The whole German conduct is in violation of international Jaw.The consistent violation of article VI by the Germans is due to their changed intention to annex those countries in disregard of the treaty, instead of acting merely as a policing force.il.-Courland, Livonia, a,nd Lithuania.8. The legal situation of Courland, Riga, the Moon Sound Islands (which belong administratively to Esthonia and Livonia), and Lithuania is very different from that of Esthonia and Couriand.* Here the treaty is so drafted as to give the Germans and Austrians full and absolute power to do what they wish, either as regards  he present administration or the future political status. In dealing with Courland and Lithuania, however, it is, de facto, the German Government which is alone concerned; the difficulty of coming to some agreement with Austria is impeding their action with regard to Poland, but the Germans do not recognise, and the Austrians do not claim, any right to intervene in the future of Lithuania and Courland.   The essential words of the treaty are that these districts &quot;shall nolonger be under Russian sovereignty.....They shall be under no obligation what-ever towards Russia, arising out of the fact that they previously formed part of Russia. Russia renounces all interference in the internal affairs of these countries. Germany and Austria-Hungary intend to decide the future fate of these territories by arrangement with, (in Benehmen mit) their population,&quot; It is clear from this that Russia has no ground for protest against any action that the Central Powers may determine to take. The rights of the population in the countries are limited to this, that there must be some kind of reference to them or consultation with them, but it is left to the Central Powers themselves to determine what form this consulta-tion will take, and they are under no obligation to accept or give effect to the views of the population in whatever form they might be expressed.   Not being* It should be noted that the Brest-Litovsk line was drawn so as to place the Moon Sound Islands to the west of it.   Of these, the Island of Dago always formed part of Esthonia, while the Islands of Oesel and Moon were added to Esthonia (on ethnographical grounds) by the Russian Provisional       / Government in April 1917.
directly&apos; parties to the treaty, Courland, Riga, the Moon Sound Islands, and Lithuania have no real standing, and are powerless to enforce tiieir own particular views.- 7. On the legal point, supposing always that the treaty were held to be valid, which of course the Allies do not propose to do, the Central Powers are absolute masters of these districts, and can do precisely what they wish. They can set up and overtnrow any form of local government which they may choose. It is open to them, if they wish to do so, to annex the whole, or only portions, of the territory in question. Criticisms of their action must, therefore, be based apart from anything having to do with the treaty.8. Land Distribution in Courland. In the &quot; Frankfurter Zeitung of the 3rd and 4th July, 1918 (short reference also in the &quot; Times &quot; of the 11th July, 1918, p. 5), an account is given of the plans for the distribution of land to German settlers in Courland. The administration decree was signed by Marshal von Hindenburg and Quartermaster-General Hahndorff on the 17th June, and issued from the German headquarters at Kovno on the 1st July. It appears that in the summer of 1915, after the occupation of Courland, the large landed proprietors agreed to sell one-third of their estates at pre-war prices for colonisation purposes, in the event of Courland being united to Germany. Their proposals under went development, and finally the military authorities were approached by the Committee of the Nobility and requested to put the matter on a legal basis. The final result is the above-mentioned decree. Under its terms, every proprietor of an estate of a size greater than 1,000 &quot; lofstellen &quot; ^360 hectares = 890 acres) is compelled in principle to sell one-third oi the estate, being land suitable for colonisation to a colonisation agency known as the Courland Land Company. The price is to correspond to the pre-war prices of 1914. If in any particular case the price cannot be settled by agreement, the matter is to be referred to a committee composed of the Marshal of Nobility in the district concerned, the chief valuator of the Courland Land Credit Society, and a representa-tive of the institution that supplies the funds to the Land Company. One-fourth of the estate is to be sold at once. Of the price 85 per cent, will be paid in cash, if there are no mortgages on it, and the balance will be given in shares of the Land Company. The Land Company has the right to purchase all land that comes into the market during the next 30 years, if effected within 3 months from the date of offering. The decree is applicable also to entailed estates. The documents of the Land Company are to be free from stamp duty, and the decree comes into force from the date of publication. The German authorities propose to settle on the land either German subjects of their own choosing, or Germans who were formerly resident in Courland. &quot; Vorwarts &quot; maintained that Hindenburg had no right to publish such a decree, and that it is the business of the Reichstag to settle the agrarian question and fix the price of land throughout the Empire.9. Lithuania. Lithuania, at present under the supreme control of the German military authorities, and under the limited authority of the Lithuanian State Council is an undefined quantity geographically, but the claims of the Lithuanian Nationalists include the following: (a.) The former Russian Government of Kovno, and parts of the Governmentsof Vilna and Suvalki. (&amp;.) The former Russian Government of Grodno, with the exception of its twosouthern districts of Brest and Kobrin, which have been assigned to theUkraine.(c.) The two districts of Niesviez and Novogrodek in the Government of Minsk.Lithuania, as thus composed, has an area of 150,000 sq. kilom., with approximately 5,000,000 inhabitants.10. During the summer of 1917 a Lithuanian Diet of 215 members was elected under German supervision. This Diet in turn elected a State Council (Taryba) of nineteen members, with M. Smetona, a member of the Nationalist party, as President. The Diet declined to give its consent to German demands for an offensive and defensive military alliance, community of coinage, control of railways, postal and tele-graphic services, and inclusion of Lithuania in the Zollverein. The Lithuanian State Council held its first sitting n November 1917, and although at first inclined to yield entirely to the strong German pressure, eventually proclaimed the independence of the country in December 1917 on the basis of self-determination, though with the
concurrence of the German military and civil authorities. Renewed pressure was-brought to bear upon the State Council and its representatives abroad with reference to the German demands, apparently however without success. At the same time the Lithuanian representatives continued to negotiate with official and unofficial representatives of Germany, whilst the State Council endeavoured to consolidate its position and extend its power in the country. In February 1918 it unanimously resolved to address a request for the third time to Germany, asking for recognition of the complete independence of the country. In the end, however, as a result of.the visit of a deputation of the State Council to Berlin in the third week of March, the German demands were accepted; in explanation of their surrender, the delegates stated that they were informed before their interview with the German Chancellor that, if they did not accept, the German Government would proceed immediately to annex the country and leave it without a shred of independence. How far the German Chancellor went in his interpretation of the original declaration of the Lithuanian State Council may be seen by corn-paring the original document with his reply to the delegation. The decision of the State Council of the 11th December, 1917, reads as follows: &quot; The Lithuanian State Council (Lietuvos Taryba), which has been recognised by the Lithuanians at home and abroad as the only authorised representation of the Lithuanian nation, proclaims on the basis of the recognised right of self-determination of nations, and the decision of the Lithuanian Conference held in Vilna the 18th-23rd September, 1917, the re-establishment of an independent Lithuanian State with Vilna as capital, and a separation of all State connections with other nations. Re-establishing this State, and guard-ing the interests of same at the peace negotiations, the State Council requests Germany&apos;s protection and assistance. Since Lithuanians life interests demand a speedy realisation of a real and intimate relation to Germany, the State Council recommends a firm bond between the Lithuanian State and Germany which could be particularly expressed by a military convention, a traffic conven-tion, customs, and mint conventions.&quot;11. The delegation received from the Chancellor the following reply: &quot; On behalf of the Kaiser and by his command, and as the representative of the German Empire, I must communicate to you the following: Since Lithuania^ State Council, as-a recognised representation of the Lithuanian people on the 11th December, 1917, has declared Lithuania^ re-establishment as an independent State in union with Germany by eternal and firm bands and by conventions, particularly the military, traffic, customs, and mint conventions, and since it requested Germany&apos;s protection and assistance for the re-establish-ment of their State, and since Lithuanians previous State attachment has been dissolved, we herewith recognise in Germany&apos;s behalf, in accordance with the Lithuanian State CounciFs declaration of the 11th December, 1917, Lithuania as a free and independent State. Germany is prepared to extend to Lithuania the desired assistance and succour, and shall provide the necessary measures in agreement with the Lithuanian people. Besides, the necessary and projected conventions shall be Executed which are requisite to fasten the relation to Germany and to upbuild that union. The Imperial Government presumes that, by entering into conventions, both Germany&apos;s and Lithuania^ interests will be taken into consideration, and that Lithuania shall participate in Germany&apos;s war burdens, which will further even Lithuania^ liberation. The formal docu-ment of recognition will be transmitted to the State Council.&quot;12. The Lithuanian State Council considered their surrender temporary only, and insist on the necessity of eventual complete emancipation from Germany. The speech of Kuhlmann, of the 24th June, in which he speaks of Lithuanian affairs as lying &quot;mainly within the domain of internal organisation,&quot; has roused the State Council to make fresh protests against that and other indications of a policy of com-plete annexation on the part of Germany. Meanwhile, in spite of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, Germany has done nothing towards repatriating the Lithuanian prisoners of war, and proceeds with the Germanisation. of the country from the schools upwards.13. On the 18th May, two delegates of the Lithuanian Council of State waited on Sir Horace Rumbold, and presented to him a request for the recognition of the
independence of Lithuania by His Majesty&apos;s Government. They said that, although Germany had recognised the independence of Lithuania on the 23rd March, the actual behaviour of the Germans in exploiting the enormous economic resources of the country shows that their recognition of its independence was illusionary. The idea of the delegates was that, although under the present circumstances the Entente Governments could not recognise the independence of Lithuania which the Germans rendered fictitious, it would be very important if some prominent statesmen of the Entente could reply to the recent speeches in the Reichstag in the sense that the German recognition of the 23rd March was a dead letter, and that the Entente Governments could not recognise the independence of Lithuania whilst the German occupation of the country was effective. Such a declaration, if brought to the know-ledge of the country would, they considered, give the people the moral force necessary1 to resist the occupying Power. Such a declaration, it may be added, would be in accordance with the spirit of the Entente policy already stated in the following words: &quot; In our opinion the general policy of our Allies should be to establish rela-tions with the Lithuanians so as to be able to encourage in any way possible their opposition to the Germans, and to emphasise that the Allies acknowledge their right to determine their own fate.&quot;14. The situation has, however, been further complicated by recent Lithuanian activities which have culminated in the proposal that William, Duke of Urach, Count of Wurtemberg, should ascend their throne as Constitutional Monarch. Such a decision, if proceeded with, &quot;will not be looked on with great favour by their ocm-patriots in the United States and elsewhere. The aspirations of many Lithuanians living outside their country are rather in the direction of a Lithu-Lettic Republic. Thus Dr. Szlupas, one of their best known representatives, writes from Stockholm under date, the 4th May, 1918: Ci Lithuanians (with the exception of the Clericals) are not in a hurry to submit to Germany: they have suffered so long before, that oppression of a short duration will not make much impression. They still expect some open support from France and Great Britain, clinging to the hope that France and England may in time see fit to recognise the Lithu-Lettic independence.&quot;15. The principal Lithuanian fear is that of domination by Poland, which is anxious to secure the Governments of Vilna, Suvalki, Grodno, and Krovno. The Lithuanians consider that the declaration on Poland issued by the Supreme War Council of the Allies, infringes the rights of Lithuania, and their National Council in Switzerland have lodged a protest on that ground. Their surrender to Germany was probably due in part to the fear that, if they proved troublesome to Germany, they could be handed over to Poland.III. The Future of the Baltic Provinces.16. It is becoming increasingly clear that this question will form one of the cruces of the Peace Conference. It is also apparent that, in any apportioning of territory, the question of the relative value of British influence in the Mediterranean and in the Baltic may obtrude itself. It is natural on first thoughts to consider that the Mediterranean is of vastly greater importance to us than the Baltic, particularly with reference to Egypt and India. There are, however, certain considerations that should not be overlooked.(1.) America is also in this war, particularly in the interests of the smaller nationalities, and will look at European problems in a very detached and impartial way. In the United States there are some 750,000 Lithuanians who are vitally interested in the independence of their native land, and who have already taken steps to bring their aspirations prominently before the United States Government. There are also at least 100,000 Esthonians, and about 25,000 Lettish citizens of the United States, who may be assumed to have not any less active interest in the future well-being of their homelands.(2.) It may be that Germany, while not in a position to dictate peace terms, will be strong enough to defend her vital interests. The last territory that she will be willing to yield on the East European front will be Courland (Riga), and possibly South Livonia. It may be the fate of Courland to come under the German flag, and there is reason to suppose that a small section of the Lettish bourgeoisie is not unsympathetic to Germany, although this is not true of the great mass of the popula-tion. In any case, for military reasons. Germany will be unwilling to return the Baltic Provinces to Russia, and, in particular, the Moon Sound Islands, which are[367-35]
the Heligoland of the Baltic. She may be ready, as a compromise, to recognise an independent neutral Esthonia under obligation to keep her harbours open ports, and on this condition restore to her the islands. It might be urged that a possible soiu-tion would be to restore the Esthonian mainland to Eussia, and let Germany keep the islands, but in the interests of the Entente one whole undivided Esthonia would be of greater value, it is important above all else to block the possibility of the German idea of a through service from Berlin to Helsingfors via Eeval (30 hours, including passage across the Gulf of Finland in 2\ hours), and thence to the Arctic coast. Already Sweden foresees with apprehension the consequent diversion of Finnish trade. To thwart all this, the independence of Esthonia may be a sine qua non. Such independence also means the freedom of the Baltic, and an open door for trade with Great Eussia, Siberia, and Central Asia.(3.) if we try to consider what advantage Germany would derive eventually from a situation which left her even without any territorial aggrandisement on the Russian frontier, the answer would still be favourable for her. For one result of the war Avill be the abolition of that Russian danger which was always supposed to be the nightmare of Germany. The autocratic centralised Russia of the past is probably gone for ever, and even if, as is probable, Russia recovers very rapidly from the war, feeling its blows on her bulky body less than the more delicately and highly organised sociai and economic structures of the Western Powers, the political readjustments necessary before she gains a state of stable equilibrium will require considerable time. It is impossible&apos; to foretell whether we shall be able to, count on such a Russia in connection with any future war as certainly as we were able to count on the Russia of 1914, for the possibilities of her economic and political subserviency to Germany are very great, and it is therefore all the more important that we should be able to count in the first instance on completely sympathetic elements like Esthonia, even if, as is probable, that little country may eventually rejoin a Federation of Russian States.(4.) Accordingly the situation in Esthonia (and what is urged with regard to Esthonia is also true in the broader aspects for Latvia and Lithuania, and in a wider measure for Georgia, Armenia, &amp;c.) seems to call, practically, for active moral support for that people in their determination to resist passively all attempts at German colonisation and domination, and, theoretically, for the consideration; of questions such as these: (a.) What attitude would the Entente take up to the independence de jure of Esthonia? This, with neutrality guaranteed by the Entente, is the ideal solution from the Estfioniian point of view. Anyhow, it seems to be a necessary stage until a Russian Federation has developed into which Esthonia would be willing to enter as a constituent element. On no account will Esthonia willingly come under Germany in any way, whilst return to any centralised Russia of the old type would be equally distasteful to her. One of the persistent lines of German propaganda in Esthonia to-day is to state that the Allies intend to give the country back to Russia, and there is little doubt that the centralising instinct is strong even, in Russian liberal leaders like Miliukoff and Kerensky. A delicate situation is therefore likely to develop, particularly if Russia shows any recovery against Germany with the aid of Allied intervention.On the other hand, it is conceivable that, as a piece of practical politics, such an independent Esthonia would have difficulty in maintaining herself alone, and would be sooner or later swept into the orbit of some greater Power or combination of Powers. Germany being out of the question, and Russia only conditionally a possibility in this respect, a further question arises: (b.) What attitude would the Entente take up to the idea of a Scandinavian or Baltic League or Federation, including Esthonia? The country most closely kin to Esthonia is Finland, and until the recent subserviency of Finland to Germany, the possibility of a close understanding between them, shared also by Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, was considerable. Into such a league the Letts might also have come, and not impossibly the Lithuanians and even the Poles. Germany has checked the move for the time being, yet the Finnish press realises that the recognition of the Esthotnian National Council by the Entente is a serious counter-stroke. An Old Finn pro-German paper like &quot; Uusi Suometar &quot; refers to the enemy who sowed tares by night in the fruitful field of German endeavour that was to reach to the Arctic coast. A Young Finn paper like &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot; welcomes the recognition and rejoices with the Esthonians in their good fortune. Finland, disillusioned&apos;, may yet become a willing agent in the promotion of such a league.
One final problem may be stated: (c.) If on the basis of self-determination Esthonia (and so also Latvia, Georgia, Ac.) were left free to decide within a period of (say ten) years what her ultimate destiny should be, how far would the Entente be prepared to guarantee her political and cultural autonomy should she decide, on that condition, to re-enter a recon-stituted Eussia which might yet seem to her insufficiently stable to be trusted alone? Por not merely are the conceptions of the old Eussia (centralised autocracy and Eussification) gone for ever, but under a League of Nations there ought to be guar-antees against the possibility of their return. The situation is still further com-plicated by the recent declaration of the Bolshevik Government (30th July) renouncing all Eussian sovereign rights in the Baltic Provinces, and recognising their independence. This has been followed by the creation on the part of Germany of a common administration for all the Baltic Provinces.o
