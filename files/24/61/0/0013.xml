Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.I should like to draw attention to the Proceedings of the Imperial War Conference, Fifteenth Day, viz., 2&apos;Jili July 1018.The position as regards a decoration for Gallipoli then appeared to be that a star and ribbon will be issued by the War Office to the Dominions concerned to bestow on their troops as they think fit.The Prime Minister of: Newfoundland, pointed out at the time that their troops fought in Gallipoli., and he supposed that if Newfoundland wished to issue a similar decoration to her soldiers who fought there she could do so. The Chairman replied, &quot;The War Office will, offer no objection.&quot; I (hen remarked that India had an exactly similar claim, and this was agreed by all the Dominion representatives..It now appears from an announcement by Mr. Macpherson in Parliament on 31st July that Imperial troops who served at Gallipoli will not receive this decoration. Had this decoration been issued by Dominion Governments, the limitation now put upon it would have been comprehensible ; though it is more than doubtful whether the gallant soldiers of Australia and New Zealand would set great value upon a decoration which was not to be shared by their comrades of the landing (the 29th Division and 2nd Indian Mountain Batteries), the 29th Indian Brigade, which took a leading part in every great action on the Peninsula from 1st May to the evacuation, and many other troops. But when, as we are now informed, the War Office are to issue, the decoration, the considerations which have led to the decision publicly announced appear to me to require examination by the War Cabinet.I agree entirely with Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s argument in his note on the subject of the 8th instant, which as I understand it, is that, providing the original, proposals have been adhered to, viz., that there should bo an international medal and a British medal for the war, with clasps for localities or specially notable battles, the claim for commemoration of phases of the war, such as Gallipoli, would not have arisen or would have been met by the distinctive (in this case Dardanelles) clasp. But the War Office decision (if, as I understand it, is so decided) to have only time clasps on the war medal, killed it as a valuable and historic record of service done, and was bound to result in claims, like the present, one, to record special services by special decorations. For example, a soldier who has been at a base, say Havre, Boulogne, or Cairo for three years, and has never seen a shot fired, will get the same clasps (1915, 1910, 1917) on his war medal as one who has fought on three fronts (and many have), viz., Egypt, Dardanelles, and France (at, say, the Somme and Cambrai).Precedent is all against such a, decision. The war medals for the Peninsula, the Crimea, and the Indian Mutiny owe their great value as heirlooms to the names they bear, and not to the bare fact of their being medals for those campaigns. Had. such a system as is now contemplated been given effect to in those days, the English race would not have been in possession of decorations with the glorious memories of Vittoria, Salamanca, Balaclava, Delhi, and Lucknow. Are the battles of the Mamie, Vpres, the Somme, the fierce struggle of Dardanelles, the prolonged operations j&apos;n Mesopotamia, and the arduous t Africa, under the mosttrying conditions, unworthy tq rank with any of our forefathers&apos; fights that they are to be relegated to dull and ineffectual&apos;ahnua 1clasps which, will leave posterity in ignorance of what they really mean? The medal, for Wellington^ Peninsula Campaign had a total of 18 (possible) clasps. Is the British medal for this war to have as many annual clasps as the war may last? Our soldiers will bitterly resent any such system ; the British public will go farther-and posterity will never forgive us for missing such an opportunity of placing on record what their fathers actually did for the cause of liberty. I urge most earnestly that this matter may b(3 considered in a more humane and sympathetic manner before a final decision is arrived at.E. S. M.13th August 1918.SS 638-1
