:  ,-v.r,.      - 2/57feoort relating to the War Work of the Board of Agriculture for Scotland for the Week Ending&quot; 2jLst August. 1918.OTP TEQEWTW3,. Diotrict Agricultural Executive Committees. Remuneration of Officers.The Board have had under consideration the question of revising the conditions of remuneration of officers of District Agricultural Executive Committees in view of the increasing importance and amount of work performed by these officers.    A revised scheme of payment has been drawn up and approved by the Board in which an effort has been made to arrive at equitable terms of remuneration on the basis of the amount of work done by the respective Committees in the various departments of work.2. Supply of Fertilisers. (a) Sulphate of Ammonia.The total quota of 10,000 tons of Sulphate of Ammonia allotted to Scotland for the period June to August 1918 has now been allocated .    Special licences for the sale of over 9,000 tons have been issued by the Board, the balance being sold under Makers&apos; General Licence.( L5uperpfr9,?pkave.A further allocation of Superphosphate to be used in the manufacture of Compound Fertilisers has been made and licences have been or are being issued, in respect of the period June to November, 1916, for quantities not less than those obtained for mixing purposes during the corresponding six months of last year.3. Seed Testing.During the past few weeks samples have been received M. &apos; the Board1s Seed Testing Station at the rate of about 70 or 80 per week.    &quot;Under the provisions of the new Seed Testing Order the work of the station promises to be heavier than in any previous season.4. Wart Disease of Potatoes.The Board regret to report that about 40 or 50 fresh outbreaks of disease have been reported to them during the past week, but fortunately these outbreaks are confined to small gardens and allotments.    A new Wart Disease Order is in.course of prepara-ttion under which the Board hope to be in a position to deal with the prevalence of the Disease in small gardens in a more effective manner than is at present possible under the existing Order.5* Coal for Agricultural Purposes.Representations have been made to the Board regarding the difficulty experienced by farmers in many parts of the country in obtaining adequate supplies of coal for the driving of threshing mills, and for other agricultural purposes.    The Board have comm-runicated with the Coal Controller pointing out that it is customary in Scotland for farmers to provide the coal required for&apos; travelling threshing mills and that owing to the greatly increased acreage /
Two meetings of the Oommittee have been reported to the Board to date.    Rules of procedure have been adopted and consider given to the general principlee on which &quot;benefits or advantages&quot; whioh are to be reckoned in lieu of payment of wages.in-cash are to be valued.    In this connection certain,proposals fcave been agreed to, but before issuing an Order on the subject the Committee I have decided to submit them to the Distriot Wages Committees for their observations.Cfe). Mfftrlffft %9 C^ttees.The majority of the Committees have held a number of meetings sinoe their Oertifioation and have agreed to certain pro. jposed minimum rates of wages.    $To minimum rates have yet however been fixed, owing to the fact that in no case has the statutory period of one month expired within which objections may be lodged against any proposed rates. !&apos;\. Annual Agricultural Returns,,.,,The tabulation of the Returns made on 4th June last is now approaching completion, and the principal figures will be given! next week.2?iiii Monthly Returns of ftive Stopk..   A table ie appended showing the estimated number of each class of live stook in Scotland at 4th August.Issue of Vouphers.The arrangements for the issue of vouchers to men engaged in agriculture and allied industries have now been adjusted! with the Ministry of tfational Service, and a Scottish Regional Instruction embodying these arrangements ie in course of prepara-ttion. .&apos;..IV, FORESTRY.The Joint Model Hying Survey Party, comprising repre-:aentatives of the three Departments of Agriculture, have completed! a Hying Survey of the area between Ealmellington in Ayrshire and Parton in Kirkcudbrightshire.    In-&quot;connection with the Plying Survey a special report has been made upon the Loch Doon area with1 a view to determining upon the advisability of its acquisition as an /aoreage under crop it ie certain that the demand for these mills will be very much greater than in previous eeaeona.    Jarmers are being advised to place their orders for coal through the ueual channels without delay and. the Board have taken steps to ascertain! whether, and, if so, to what extent, the supply of coal for agrl. scultural purposes will be affected by the new rationing arrange-rments, and further, whether any degree of priority will be given V to orders for coal required for suoh purposes.6..

an afforestation subject.The Survey Party have proceeded to Strathdon in Aberdeen-:shire.3. Brushwood Burning.,Reports from all parts of the country show that the Pine Weevil and the Beetle are increasing in numbers and that the damage already done to young plantations is very great.    About 800 school boys are at present employed upon burning and clearing recently felled areas, and applications have also been made for women labour in response to the Board&apos;&apos;s representations to proprie-:tors.    These applications have been dealt with by the Women1s Section of the Ministry of Labour.     It has not been possible to organise casual labour for the work.3. Osier Cultivation.The question of the cultivation of Osiers has been taken up by the Board in conjunction with the Fishery Board for Scotland with a view to meeting the shortage in supplies of material for basket and crate making etc    Representatives of the consuming industries have been consulted and enquiry is being made into the possibilities of developing Osier growing in suitable places.4. Forestry Training for Disabled Sailors and Soldiers.Reference is made to the Report of 31st July relative to the suggestion that men under training should receive a small weekly bonus from Estates in virtue of the work done incidental to their training.The Board have now received replies from most of the proprietors- concerned.    It appears that the adoption of a uniform bonus of 5/- per week in addition to the free accommodation and training..already provided would be generally acceptable.The representations received on the subject show that in the main the existing allowance of 27/6 is considered to be insufficient; the adoption of m, unifoim rate would prevent dis-:satisfaction on the part of the men, and would not prejudice a man whose injury was temporarily more disabling than that of his neighbour; and that 5/- per week would be a fair allowance to make.The Board have asked Proprietors whether they would be prepared to adopt the above proposal with regard to any men placed on estates for instruction under the scheme.
