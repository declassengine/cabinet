The Alliance Aeroplane Works Settlement.The final terms of settlement of the dispute at the Alliance Aeroplane Works, London, which were published in the press on the 12th August, form a matter of general interest-. It may be recalled that friction between the management and the men had existed for some time. While the owners were members of the Engineering Employers&apos; Federation, and were thus parties to the Coventry (engineering) shop stewards&apos; agreement of 1917, their workmen were woodworkers belonging to unions outside the engineering industry, and having no such agreement; and wished to negotiate all matters through a works committee, the members of which were elected by the shop as a whole, and not necessarily shop stewards. In fact, Rock, who was elected chairman, was not a steward, and the strike finally broke out in consequence of his dismissal for calling a meeting, during working hours, under the instructions of his committee, for the consideration of the matters in dispute. The strike was settled by the Government assuming control of the factory and Rock being rein-stated after the change of control had been effected, pending an enquiry, which finally resulted in his dismissal for misconduct in calling of meetings.The management of the works will now be restored to the company under an agreement signed by both the company and the London District Aircraft Committee  approved by the Ministry of Munitions which provides for recognition of shop stewards elected by the workpeople on condition that the works rules are conformed[1100-42] B
to. A committee for purposes of negotiation will also be recognised. Its members are not to exceed seven in number, and all are to be shop stewards and elected by the shop stewards themselves. Questions not settled in consultation with a foreman or departmental manager will be discussed by the committee and management, and failing an agreement between them will be taken up between the Engineering Employers&apos; Federation and either the executives of the unions concerned or the London District Aircraft Committee.   Rock is to be engaged again.This settlement is satisfactory, in so far as it recognises the unions and the District Aircraft Committee, as the latter is affiliated to a National Committee, with which the Ministry of Munitions concluded an agreement in October 1917. The District Aircraft Committee also proposes to recommend a modification of its rules, so that shop stewards may be elected for a longer term than one month, as is at present the custom; and both parties to the agreement consider that the names of shop stewards, when elected, should be notified to the Management and the District Committee, thus strengthening the constitutional basis. The importance of the case lies in the fact thai in a new industry works or shop committees have now been linked up with the official trade union organisation in a case arising out of a dispute in which the workers had struck against the advice of their official representatives.II. Press Comments.Military Affairs.Most of the Labour papers make brief comments on the fifth anniversary of the war. The &quot; Herald &quot; and the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; as usual, deal with the subject as the occasion for further peace supplications. The &quot; Herald &quot; assures its readers that if another three years are necessary for the salvation of democracy and of civilisation the British people will not shrink from the sacrifice, but the common people of the world will&apos;not be prepared to go on fighting for the ghastly muddle of discredited Governments. In any case, if Germany is beaten within three year-; America will have the credit. The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; while saying that the messages of the Prime Minister and Mr. Churchill are just what might be expected, laments that something better might have been expected from Mr. Asquith, whose cowardice as a leader has destined the Liberal party. The &quot; Clarion &quot; and &quot; Justice &quot;strike a more cheerful note. The former paper says that the Allies have just gained the most momentous victory since the first battle of the Marne, and the tide has now definitely turned. &quot; Justice&quot; believes that the people will win this war in spite of the politicians. Mr. Hyndman scouts the idea of formulating plans for peace, as the Allied war aims must depend on where German armies are and how many of them are left when the Allied forces gain the final defeat.Russia.Writing before the issue of the message from the Allied Governments to the Russian nation, the ki Herald &quot; and the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; continue to attack the policy of intervention. The former appeals to Labour for a further protest; while the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; describes Russia, now invaded by foreign Governments, as a second Belgium. The &quot; Clarion,&quot; which, with &quot; Justice,&quot; has never openly opposed intervention, publishes a long account of the failure of the Bolshevik Government, taken mainly from the official Russian paper &quot; Izviestia.&quot; The results of working-class control have not been satisfactory, and the factories have seen established, in place of the old master, a new owner equally individualistic and equally anti-social in the commission of control. The condition of the railways is seriously alarming. Nationalisation of banks and the institution of working-class control have destroyed industry.&quot; Common Sense &quot; considers the news from Russia to be very bad, and asks why President Wilson has given way on the policy of intervention. Intervention may very easily, it believes, produce civil war, and with the &quot; Merthyr Pioneer &quot; it agrees that the Presidents hand has been forced, or otherwise he would not have consented to such a disastrous move.On the other hand, the &quot; New Statesman &quot; thinks that the Allies could not desert the Czech-Slovaks, and hopes that the policy which has restricted the scale of the Allied Army has not kept it too small to help them promptly and efficaciously.
Peace Propaganda.Mr. Lansbury makes a despairing appeal for peace in the &quot; Herald/&apos; basing his arguments on plain. Christian principles. He can find no hope in the sermons of Archbishops and other clericals, and goes back to the Gospel for a message to readers of his paper. The Labour movement is the one great means by which alone the world can be saved. &quot; Justice,&quot; on the other hand, thinks the war can most speedily be ended by a Government of militant democrats knowing what they want and. determined to get it. Such a Government could settle the Irish question and reorganise industries. A strong attack on Mr. A. Henderson appears in a leading article. His contradictory statements about the reply of the German Majority are held up to ridicule, and it is suggested that either he or M. Huysmans is confusing the principles of the Stockholm Committee with the Stockholm statements of the old German Social Democratic Party. &quot; Justice &quot; also fails to gather any clear idea of the policy meant by Lord Lansdowne&apos;s second letter, which is looked upon, with suspicion even by Miss Pankhurst in the &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought.&quot; She appeals to Mr. Macdonald and Mr. Snowden to explain the policy if Lord Lansdowne has made it clear to them.India,Criticisms on the Indian proposals are still meagre. The &quot; Herald &quot; dismisses Lord Sydenhanfs. speech&apos;as typical of a retired Anglo-Indian, though unfortunately speeches of this nature account for the hatred which educated Indians bear to the arrogant British, bureaucrats. The net result of the two debates is only talk, as the Government has not yet considered the matter. India is in the same position as Ireland. St. Nihal Singh, in the same paper, criticises the proposals as maintaining too much power to officials in the Imperial Council. Indians cannot accept a system giving them no power over important branches of administration which affect India as a whole. Although the proposals fall far short of Indian expectations, they are the result of a sincere effort, and the writer does not underrate their importance or wish to sec them wrecked or shelved. In &quot; Justice &quot; appears a plea for careful consideration, of the interests of the low-caste people when working out details.Imperial Preference.The decision of the Cabient to support Imperial Preference is adversely criti--eised by most Labour papers, though not by all. Mr. Brailsford, in the &quot; Herald,&quot; opposes preference, but carefully distinguishes his position, from that of the old Free Traders who based their opposition on the principles of Bright and CobcTeh. No preference can be given, to the colonies without taxing either food or raw materials, and Protection would mean an addition to the sum total of human toil. What is required is the new conception of economic co-operation between nations instead of economic strife. An economic boycott can be no substitute for war if States exist in habitual economic independence of each other. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; thinks that Mr. Lloyd George has now identified, himself not only with the policy of Imperial Preference but even with that of full Protection. A question is asked whether Mr. Barnes is a party to this decision. The &quot; Clarion &quot; sides with the Cabinet, and claims that politicians have merely discovered the old truisms of the Socialists. The object, however, must be not to punish the enemy or to revenge wrongs, but rather to render the enemy incapable of again attacking.Cotton Rota.The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; recommends acceptance of the Control Board&apos;s scheme, which it describes as an attempt to mitigate the&apos;hardships of &apos; permanent playing-ofT. It warns the Board that the scheme will require to be worked broad-mindedly and humanely.The Embargo.A few comments continue to be made on the strike at Coventry and Birming-ham. The &quot; Clarion,&quot; which has always opposed the strike, compares the action of the Government to that of a private employer posting up a notice, &quot; No Hands
TIL-District Reports.London and South-E&quot;astern.Some small and unimportant strikes have occurred in this area, but the condition is on the whole quiet and satisfactory.A grievance has arisen against the manager of the National Aircraft Factory, Waddon, because all newly-engaged unskilled workers are being paid at a lower rate than those who have worked there for some time. In some cases the difference is as much as 255., and this naturally causes much discontent. The A.S.E. are ready to support the unskilled workers in any action they may desire to take, and meetings are to be held shortly.South-Western.The increased cost of living has received considerable discussion at Woolwich recently, and a mass meeting has been called by the Woolwich Workers&apos; Union to consider this question; it is probable that a demand for a rise of 105. a week will be put forward. Serious discontent has arisen in Dorsetshire, owing to the decision of the farmers to pay the minimum wage only from the 22nd July, instead of from the 1st April as fixed by the Central Wages Board. The labourers who are trade unionists, threaten trouble upon this point, and, in view of the approaching harvest, this may prove serious.*Wanted.&quot; It also compares the embargo imposed by the Government to that accepted by the London sheet-metal workers. The &quot; Call&quot; states that the strike had a strong backing of trade union organisations, and demands that the committee should consult the men in the course of its enquiry. The &quot; New Age &quot; considers that the end of the strike was in no way due to the issue of the proclamation threatening military service, but rather to the action of reason among the men. This proclama-tion was from all points of view ill-advised, and might even have induced the men to remain on strike.Whitley Committees.&quot; Justice &quot; supports the London Committee of the A.S.E. in opposing Whitley Councils, though not altogether for the same reasons. It considers that the demand of Labour for the control of industry is a grotesque expression, and some remarks in the circular are of a distinctly syndicalist nature. A great deal more educa-tional work is required before Labour can pretend to assume control of industry.Labour and Capital.The &quot; Electrician,&quot; in the hope of improving relations, has started a weekly article by a Labour correspondent. In the first of these the Ministry of Munitions is blamed for not consulting the unions more fully before instituting the embargo, and for not constituting joint committees to work it.Wages.The &quot; Herald&quot; attacks the Agricultural Wage Board, which it considers is entirely under the control of farmers.The Consigners&apos; Council.In Mr. Hjmdmams weekly article on the Food Consumers&apos; Council in &quot; Justice &quot; he praises the Ministry for its general good work, qualifying his remarks by strictures on the delay in extending production at home, on the effort to maintain the existing system of retail trade, and on the refusal to make more use of the co-operative societies. He winds up with the assertion that the increase of 2d. in the lb. for tea is entirely due to the manipulation by the Government of the Indian Exchange.
West Midlands.Few reports have been received from this area, and the situation seems to be unusually quiet.A recent conference at Birmingham, including representatives from a large number of trade unions and trade councils, passed a unanimous resolution in con-demnation of the secret treaties. A branch of the National Union of Railways near Burton-on-Trent have also passed a similar resolution, and demand that the Govern -ment should make every effort to negotiate peace on the basis of self determination.Yorkshire and East Midlands.With the exception of the dispute of surface workers, which is dealt with in Part IV, the condition of this area shows little disturbance.Some unrest prevails among the agricultural labourers at Holderness. The Agricultural Labourers&apos; Union have threatened to bring their men out unless a wage of 4:1. a week for men living out, and 3/. for men living in, is conceded; while at Long Buckley a demand has been put forward for 10s. a day and Is. Qd. an hour overtime during the harvest time.The Lincolnshire Farmers&apos; Union are anxious to contest one of the Lincolnshire seats at the next election, and are desirous of concerted action with the Agricultural Workers&apos; Union upon this question.A meeting of the Leeds Trades&apos; Council, which met to discuss the recommenda-tions of the Whitley Report, was, on the whole, favourable in tone. Stress was laid upon the point that non-unionists must not be represented upon industrial councils, while it was suggested that the Trade Union Congress should form a special com-mittee to consider the report.North-Western.Little unrest has been evident in this area, and the engineers at Liverpool, Manchester, and Barrow have recently been having holidays.Discontent prevails among the dockers and coal-heavers at Liverpool, owing to their inability to obtain beer at night after working overtime, and the coal-heavers have now refused to work overtime. They are also agitating for a 5-day week at 1/. a day. The grant of this would lead to serious delay in coaling steamers, as the men would be able to earn sufficient wages without the necessity of working overtime, and some relaxation in the beer rules seems called for.The final decision of the Cotton Control Board to abolish the rota system is, on the whole, received with dissatisfaction by the operatives, though, in some cases, it seems to have been recognised as necessary. At Nelson a resolution to accept the new proposals of the Board was defeated by a large majority, and at Burnley a vote of censure was passed upon the Council of the Textile Workers&apos; Association for failing to retain the rota system. At Rochdale, on the other hand, the view is expressed in some quarters that its abolition was inevitable.Northern.No reports have been received from this area. South Wales.Apart from a strike in Carmarthenshire, which is dealt with elsewhere, con-ditions in this area show little unrest.The return of the miners to work after their three days&apos; holiday was in most cases satisfactory throughout the district.Scotland.Isolated disputes of a trivial character have cropped up in this area.The Edinburgh women tramway workers are threatening to strike unless paid equal wages with the men.Among the miners in Lanarkshire excitement still continued over the 3s. Qd. rise which they have demanded, and there are rumours of a strike if it is not conceded.[1100-42] C
The Fife and Kinross miners are disturbed by the action of men working six days * week in some pits, and at a meeting on the 10th, a resolution was passed threatening picketing at such pits unless the authorities ceased from pressing the men to work.* The meeting of the Clyde Defence Propaganda Committee on the 4th was attended by about 5,000 people, and was apparently of a much more violent nature than previous meetings of this description, while various free fights occurred, and the assistance of the police had to be summoned. The speeches dealt principally with MacLean&apos;s imprisonment, the incompetency of the present Government, and the suppression of the Socialist press, and all were of a very extreme character. Speak-ing upon the first subject, Gallacher strongly urged the workers to organise a strike and so force the Government to release MacLean. Resolutions were carried pro-testing against the Governments action in imprisoning MacLean, and in dismantling the Socialist press.A meeting of the Discharged Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Federation was held at the same time, at which a resolution was passed calling upon the Government to increase the pensions of discharged soldiers and war widows.IV.-Disputes. (a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work.The situation remains quiet and satisfactory, and the number of strikes reported is again comparatively small. To some extent this is probably due to engineers&apos; holidays.The Admiralty Labour Department reports only three strikes this week, two of which occurred in the Glasgow and one in the Newcastle area.At Messrs. D. and W. Henderson;&apos;s, Glasgowj 185 riveters ceased work owing to a wages dispute. The men had been paid a certain allowance for working with old machinery, but when new parts were introduced, the allowance was deducted. The men now insist that it should still be paid, and have ceased work in consequence.At Messrs. Russell and Co., Glasgow, a dispute occurred as to rates for drilling out rivets, and the men ceased work., The dispute was referred to a joint committee, and it was hoped that work would be resumed on the 12th.In the Newcastle area a small number of men came out at Messrs. Forster and Sons, owing to the firm&apos;s refusal to grant payment of a recent Committee on Produc-tion award of 10 per cent, to blacksmiths on merchant work. The employers&apos; Associa-tion have directed the firm to continue to refuse, as the men have already received a 20 per cent, increase.The iron moulders at Sheffield have now returned to work, and a conference is to be held with the Ministry of Munitions to arrange the terms of settlement.The Ministry of Munitions reports a total of 3,566 involved in workers strikes for the week ending the 7th August. This number shows a large decrease upon the number reported at the end of the previous week. The total number of workpeople involved in strikes for the month of July was 74,768.At Feltham 1,200 men are on strike owing to a demand for l\d. an hour increase to men of the London District coming to work at Feltham. The men residing outside the London District and working with them do not apparently receive this addition.Bricklayers in the St. Helens district struck on the 8th for an increase of their rates. Notice had been given to the Ministry of Labour of this intention unless their claim was settled in the meantime.The strike at the Levant Mine, St. Just, continues.The clerks at the Ebbw Vale Steel Iron and Coal Co. have returned to work unconditionally.The War Office Contracts Department have no fresh strikes to report. The dispute in the cotton trade in Wigan and district is now at an end. The settlement agreed upon grants an advance equivalent to one of 10 per cent, on pre-war rates, while the &quot;Wigan and District Employers&apos; Association have agreed to make a final settlement as&apos; to the adoption or refusal of the Universal Cardroom and Ring Spinning Lists before the 20th August.The Coal Controller has ten new strikes to report, involving 15,500 men. Work has been resumed in three of these cases.The strike at the Tirydail Colliery has now spread to neighbouring collieries. The matter is in the hands of the Joint Disputes Committee of owners and miners for
South &quot;Wales, and as the collieries are in an anthracite district, the strike is not very important from the point of view of output.A further stoppage has taken place at the Ladysmith Colliery, Cumberland, as an after effect of the enginemen&apos;s strike reported last week.The strike at the Risca Colliery is at an end.(b.) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.The Admiralty Labour Department has few important controversial cases to report.A dispute has, however, arisen at Messrs. J. J. Thorneycroft and Co. between the Boilermakers&apos; Society and the Southampton Employers&apos; Association as to the application of the award of the Committee on Production to piece-workers and lieu-rate workers. The ironworkers have, in consequence, ceased working overtime, and about 1,400 men at Southampton are now involved. The case has been referred to the Committee on Production for decision.The Ministry of Munitions reports that a dispute has arisen at Messrs. Grimaldi and Co., South Lambeth. The shop stewards spent 3^ hours of working hours at a shops&apos; committee meeting, and now demand to be paid for this time. The Ministry has intervened in favour of the firm, and has recommended a permanent arrangement upon this score.The woodworkers employed by Messrs. J. Blake and Co., Liverpool, have threatened to strike unless fourteen women workers join a union which has been formed by the local shop stewards to include all women workers in the aircraft industry of this district.The War Office Contracts Department have no controversial cases to report.The Coal Controller has no new controversial cases to report. Nine old cases still remain unsettled. No settlement has been reached as to the dispute of surface-men in Yorkshire, and notices have been handed in throughout the district. A con-ference has, however, been arranged for the 15th, and it is hoped that no stoppage will occur. &apos;A further concession has been offered to miners and surface workers regarding the payment of the war wage for overtime. This concession is said to have become almost inevitable since the concession by the Ministry of Munitions of war wage on overtime to coke workers.The Chief Industrial Commissioner reports 118 new differences, eighteen of which are claims for the 12-1 Per cerjt- bonus. *A dispute has arisen between the farmers of Down and Armagh and their labourers which threatens to interfere with the flax crop. Arbitration is shortly to be held upon the case.No report has again been received from the Committee on Production.G. H. ROBERTS.0
