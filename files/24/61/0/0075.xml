To maintain a minimum supply of milk, I estimate that 1,500,000 tons of feeding stuffs will be re-quired for cows during the year.   Unless this is pro-vide d, the milk supply will break down.. Meat Supplies 3.      As for meat, the enormous demands of the AlliedArmies, the shortage of refrigerated tonnage and the cutting off of Australasian supplies owing to the -diversion of ships to the Atlantic, will reduce our imports of frozen meat for civilian consumption from an average of about nearly 25^000 tons in the cereal year 1917-18 to less than 10,000 tons per month in 1918. This will almost certainly render necessary a reduction of the meat ration to not more than one lb. per head from November or December onwards. Unless a bare minimum of concentrated feeding stuffs is provided, farmers wij.1 be unable to keep their cattle and sheep for fattening during the winter, and we shall be faced with a shortage in the early months of 1919 more acute even than that of 19i8.brking 4.      It is necessary to bear in mind also the needs ofprses,working horses which are essential both in the production -   of food on the farm and in its distribution to consumers. The supply of food for working horses has this year beendangerously 3hort*
9 9 r%h c) oaparison   5.     Last year, in view of tho shipping situation no provision :,h lastan,&apos; was made for any direct import of feeding stuffs, but we hada reserve of 250,-000, to 300,000 tons in the hands of farmers,and a magnificent root crop.     In practice also in the courseof the year 850,000 tons of imported cereals (other thanoffals) were distributed for animal feeding.    This year,stocks in the hands of farmers are practically nil, the rootcrop is much below the average, home production of cake willbe less, and the Max Office are preparing to commandeer astill larger proportion of hay.jections to 6. The view has been urged by Mr. Hoover and others that ort ofi)ding stuffs.animal feeding stuffs should only be imported after all re-quirements of human food had been met.   As a purely abstractprinciple it is difficult to object to this.   If, however, itis so applied in the present year as to preclude .any substanfetial importation of feeding stuffs, it will have disastrouseffects on these supplies of human food,   In any case, I muststrongly urge that animal foods should take precedence of rawmaterials for civilian trades, such as leather and textiles.strous   7.     Apart fr-om the immediate consequences of a dangerous cts oncultural    reduction in tfie supplies of milk, cheese, and meat, I agree ation.with the views of agriculturalists that a sufficient supply of concentrated feeding stuffs is essential for the food pr oduc 11on programme. (a)     The maintenance of our herds at a point as near the present level as possible is some safeguard&apos; against any further reduction in world tonnage.     If t&apos;he war should continue longer, the preservation of our present low level of home production seems the only safe course to pursue
(b) The feeding of live-stock provides manure for the soil.    A harvest like that of tho present year will be impossible next year, unless as many stock are fed on the farms this year as last.    -Already, owing to the lack of fodder,, sheep are. steadily decreasing,, and the result will inevitably appear in diminished grain production.(c) Our pedigree herds must be maintained if we are to retain our position as the breeding centre, of the world.Conclusion. 8.      Animal fodder is the raw material for food productionat home.     X cannot agree to a course being followed which would starve our herds, endanger the supply of m^lk, cheese and meat, and inflict the most serious injury on the whole agricultural industry without laying the gravity of the issue before the Cabinet and asking for an express instruction from them before our agreed programme is reduced.    The Secretary for Scotland, the Chief Secretary for Ireland and the President of the Board of Agriculture have seen this memorandum and agree with the vviews which I have expressed.Ministry of Food...
