-(THIS DOC j :INT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAIN IC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT.) --------,--.t----,---------,-3 ICR is jr.. 0G.T.54S0.WAR   CABINET.replace; ent of repatriated germ an prisoners.Memorandum Toy General Seely.I desire to support very strongly the Memorandum circulated, by the Minister of National Service with regard to the steps that should he taken to replace sn essentialindustries in this \country the German prisoners of vK^r who are likely to &quot;be withdrawn under the repatriation ;G.T.&apos;   \-scheme.     5421Thel&amp;inistry of Munitions is vitally interested in this question, inasmuch as approximately 6,000 German Prisoners &apos; are employed on very urgent        work.    Of these men a considerable proportion are employed on work which is:vitally necessary to the steel programme, in the getting of ironstone, and in the quarrying of limestone, ganister and dolomite,As art example of the extent to which the programme of the Ministry of Munitions would suffer by the withdrawal of these men I mention the case of three limestone quarries in the -.7 ear dale district, Co. Durham.   There are employed in three quarries in this neighbourhood986 Prisoners of ,/ar. Limestone quarrying was cne of the earliest branches of work upon .which German prisoners were employed in this country.   The repatriation scheme applies to those Prisoners who have been in captivity -v fcr more than 18 months at the date cf repatriaticn, and inasmuch as the majority of the prisoners have been employed in these quarries since 1916, it is obvious that they would suffer to a greater extent than other important national work on which more recently captured German prisoners have been employed.   In one of the three quarries mentioned above, 328 out of 396 men are -affected, in the second 211 out of 300 end in the third, 147 ou* of 290.   The loss of the prisoners from these three quarries al i would,  it is estimated, mean an approximate reduction of at least 6,500 tons por week in the output from the main source f    of supply to the 01eveland blast furnaces which consume on an average about 37,000 tons per week,.Other important work on which German prisoners are emplryedffor the Ministry of Nunitions)would be affected to a considerable extent;    but it is no exaggeration to say that the steel programme will be gravely imperilled unless arrangements are made to ensure the provision of efficient substitutes as and when these men are released.The difficulty of replacing these men from British sources is insurmountable.   The majority of the Prisoners working on ironstone, limestone, etc, are employed in desolate, out-of-the-way parts of the country, and are accommodated in hutments which have been specially constructed for them,.   Even if able-bodied British labour, fit to undertakethis
this, work, were available, which is not the case, it would not be possible to perRua.de the men to go and live in nutrients in these remote districts to undertake ^ork of this strenuous character, when there are so many more attractive alternative activities open to them.After careful consideration the advisers have come to the conclusion that the only nethod of replacing these men is that suggested in the memorandum put forward by the Minister of National Service.     It is necessary to have physically strong men for the work, and such men could be found in large numbers from our tropical possessions or could be imported from China, It is quite certain, however, that the attitude of labour in this country would be bitterly hostile to any such scheme, and, I thin):, rightly, for .reasons too long for elaboration in the present paper.     These conditions do not aoply in France ^here the population have accepted the importation of coloured labour-ers;as a war measure.     I therefore, strongly support the proposal that arrangements should immediately be made for securing additional coloured labour to work behind the lines in France, and that German Prisoners of an equal number should, be transferred to this country as and when the batches of German Prisoners depart under the provisions of the repatriation scheme(Signed)   J, S3ELY.P.3.      Sinco writing tho foregoing Finute, tho number ofprisoners taken by. us has increased so largely that I would urge that 6,000 prisoners be sent here to replace those about to be repatriated, irrespective of the importation of coloured labour to franco to replace them..(Intd.)   J.S.,Ministry of Munitions. August 19th, 1918.
