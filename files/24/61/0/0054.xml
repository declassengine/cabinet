I fully realise that a part of activity of non-combatant population of Groat Britain is employed in the common interests of Alliance, $aval construction, maritime transport, working of coal mines, arc ,! British works uhich benefit all the Entente nations.   Admitting that Great Britain sets aside for these purposes -a million workers among the men from 19 to 43 years of age not&quot;mobilised, (without merition-ing all Irishmen or your large excess of men of groator ago) there would remain, to you in those same classos of age, more than two additional millions of men wno^have noyer been mobilleeAV^^o^oould. sTIIl^moEIirso a^IITibTlirQh of Those1&apos;two million without exceeding . (all proportions being&apos; maintained), the French effort.I do not doubt that this coBrjarison will lead you to recognise that General Sackville West has an exaggerated idoa of the exhaustion of the country when ho thinks it impossible to maintain 50 divisions (I leave aside the 10 divisions from -Dominions).- I venture to think that a well-established recruiting plan applied without cassation would give you easily the effectives which it is necessary to add to rooxults of 18 years in ordor to keop at fullstrengthIr^citMmrt^r^ His Britannic JsJaJeety*8 Government).        *111*       I   \ VT A E    0 A 13 I N 13 T.5454.-     I r.....&apos;     BRITISH   M-P0\BR  Mfer of telegram from Lord Derby (Paris)^ 17thl^stu,^18^Despatched 6.25 p,m. august 17th, 1918, Received    8.0   a*m.   August 18th, 1918.4 ..... iM:..997 (P.).    Very Urgent..following for Prime Minister (? from) M.Clemenceau. % the 13th ultimo you informed me that Imperial War Cabinet, foreseeing a big attack on British front thought it necessary to increase proportion of American troops behind that front, pA summary examination of distribution of forces allowed me at that moment to ascertain that density of troops in line or In reserve Was considerably stronger on the whole British front than on most of exposed parts of French front.  At the same moment, the turn taken by military events proved that General loch had for some time. to concentrate his thoughts on the French sector.   That is why I deferred answering your letter, and left over till later the task of examining certain assertions made by Imperial to Cabinet tend-in g to,dhow that British Empire has arrived at end of sacrifices : which it could make in comraor   causes   The same impression was    :t gfcven tc me by a Note of your Permanent Military Representative on Superior (? Supreme)&apos; War Council trying to -orove that Great Britain should suppress Infantry from 21 divisions and also by a question of War Office transmitted by General spiers regarding the eventual suppression of French divisions.It seems necessary to me to-day to explain myself clearly on this question,   as regards  Vance I assure you we do not intend to suppress any division.   The resources at your disposal all whose recruiting is assured will probably permit us to have in all our divisions on 1st Kareh 1919 more than 8,000-infantrymen without taking from 1920 Classa   But X must observe that we shall proceed to concentration of services and to (group undecipherable) of avails able forces to utmost extremity.The British population of military age numerically very much greater jhan fcench populationt and less tried by &apos; \8ar losses&apos;.&apos; should without u ;y oe afcle to obtain half the number of divisions.
strength? that number of units. It is urgued that prolongation of recruiting effort could only make its effect felt next year, and that it would not remedy the present shortage which makes our effectives unable to support without weakening losses resulting from prolonged operations being carried on now. This situation was foreseen from the moment when you exhausted your resources in order to fill the losses in battle of the Somme. According to your letter this situation would continue until the new class taken in April is ready, viz: until September.

This situation itself would be aggravated, if as I learn, the War Office had decided? th? retain men not for six months but for twelve months before sending them to France.

Knowledge of similar obstacles which we have surmounted in France authorises me to think there also the difficulties have been exaggerated. So long as services behind the line and in interior have not attained their limit of compression, combatants can be extracted therefrom. Now the French Army on the North-East front counts three combatants to one non-combatant. Moreover, for 1,000 men maintained on different fronts or in the Colonies, the number of military men immobilized in France (land army alone) is nearly double in Great Britain what it is in France.

In calling up personnel behind the lines and in interior by methods similar to those we have followed, the War Office could procure effectives which it needs to tide over time until new recruits arrive. It could, without any doubt, thereby immediately find trained men, if it took for choice a part of 500,000 men who during last two years, have been considered physically weakened without being discharged and unfit. During a similar period, we only lost 145,000 men as being considered physically weakened instead of 500,000. It is therefore certain that you could obtain a large proportion of these 500,000 men by methods similar to those which we have applied successfully.

It appears also that at present as in future, the United Kingdom is in a position to maintain 50 divisions without loss to its Navy and without lessening essential means of its very useful contribution towards general requirements of the Entente.

How can France forget that the United Kingdom decided to fight at her side on very day when Germany attacked her: that Great Britain with her Dominions and Colonies immediately brought her the assistance of her fleet and armies: that by guaranteeing by her naval strength the liberty of the seas she realised first condition of victory: that by her tonnage distributed among Allied countries, she has contributed in largest measure to supply (? French&apos; omitted) with means of receiving what is necessary for their defence and existence?

Great Britain did not hesitate to modify radically traditional regime of her military organization, to establish basis of a new regime permitting, if applied integrally according to its guiding principle, the mass of effectives indispensable to success of the Allied Armies to be opposed to enemy forces.

With a view of this success, everything depends on our redoubling our efforts to crush as soon as possible an enemy over whom our magnificent armies have just gained a definite ascendancy. It is only by persisting in their individual efforts that nations which first entered the struggle will give American effort the value of an irresistible force. That unfortunately does not seem to be understood by everybody, for yesterday M. Nitti went to London without us in order to ask for American divisions for Italian front without even stating for what sort of operations they would be required. Now the Serbians and Belgians are making the same request.

I should he much astonished if United States Grovom-viont and OommancLor-in-Ohiof wore disposed to accept such arrangements. Ho one more than I appreciatestho value of American assistancoo But our old Europe, Which engaged in war without counting on that help, cannot consider possibility of &quot;passing tho hand&quot; to its Trans-Atlantic Allies for completion of military task which will found a now Europe.Tho history of our two countries, and sacrifices of all sorts which no it hor of them havo bargained about, aro sufficient -or oofs that wo v/ill not in any way slacken our offort at a moment when wo sec the dawn of approaching victory,   It is with this feeling I beg you tocount on integrity of Eronch co-operation, just as, for my part, I count on integrity of British co-operation, .  .
