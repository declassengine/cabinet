.......CASP T&apos; -*Lit I *vThis Document is the Property of&quot;81s GrKan !c iVi&apos;:jesty&apos;s Government,B6ard of Agrioulture and fflshsrieg,. Report for week enfled 13th August, 19X8, 78/ALand Pivision.Small Holding Colonies.Holbeaoh.   The horses have been busy carting raateri als for the build&quot; and soil for repairing the various farm yards,, also spraying potatoes and cutting oats.    The settlors axe pi ogressing satisfactorily;   they have all been busy pulling flax, which is now completed,     Harvest operations have commenced, and if the weather holds fine the crops will be ready as fast as they can be cut.Patringtcn.     The ordinary farming operations have continued, and a start Has been made with wowing the peas.    The heavy rains, which have continued during the week, have 3aid the com crops rather badly.    The crops, produce and stock disposed of during the week included 1 cwt Palm Kernel Meal, and 25 qrs. oats. Six members of the VTinterton Farmers Club, North Lincolnshire, visited the Colony on the 7th August.Heath Hill.    The com harvest has not yet been commenced on the Colony, but everything is in readiness for a start next week. All the settlers are putting in extra hours and doing as much as they are able amongst the corn.     This season the general rate of pay in the district appears to be from  4 to  4. 10. per month in addition to the usual wages, and it has been agreed to give  4. 10. this to include the extra work of getting in the second crops of &quot;Seeds&quot; hay.Kelham Estate..Harvesting was started on the 5th August with four new binders and three hundred acres have been cut to date, averaging nearly 10 acres per day per binder, including the time taken for moving and also damp weather.    The available staff is insufficient to keep pace with every operation, and arrangements have been diffioult to make with regard to stooking.    As there appears to be every prospect of the weather changing we have obtained the temporary assistance of 50 R.S. Cadets to prevent 100 acres of corn remaining unstooked.    10 big stacks of corn have been put up to date.    Provision is being made for the 150 acres necessary for the sugar beet next year, and the allocation of the remaining arable has been considered;   in the main it is proposed to sow the recently ploughed turf land with wheat which, with the mangolds and ley ground,will provide a good acreage for the wheat crop.    The land capable of growing a further corn crop will be devoted to winter oats, and a large part cf the . remainder cf the &quot;strong land&quot; will be sown with beans tc provide a change.Tithe. Copyhold, Commons and Survey Branch.The applications received during the past week included one for Altered Apportionment, four for Redemption, and two for 2&amp;erger of tithe rentcharge, and five for the Enfranchisement cf Copyhold Land?., while six redemptions cf tithe rentcharge and one redemption of a copyhold enfranchisement rentcharge have been confirmed.    The Board still continue to receive many suggestions for the inclusion of provisions of various kinds in the Tithe Bill. One of the suggestions most frequently made by clergymen is that some relief should be given to thera in respect of the rates payable on tithe rentcharge in consideration of the fact that it is proposed by the Bill to limit the rise in value of tithe rentcharge.
flax Product ion, Branch.In order to ensure the completion of the harvest operations hy 3&amp;st August certain emergency measures have been adopted.(l)   800 soldiers have been supplied by Food Production Branch for the Salby area where the arrears are the most sorious.(2)   WobmiJs Camps will bo extended to 31st August.(3)   All camps where possible to work overtime and also on Sundays.(4)   Additional local labour is being obtained.(5)   Bonus for piece-work is inorsassd by 50$  up to the present no workers have earned any bonus for piecework.(6)   300 additional prisoners of War asked for.During the past 10 days good progress has been made and the newly arrived parties of City Workers arc in most cases superior to those who hava completed their holidays and left camp.   Parties &apos; of the Women&apos;s Land Army have bean allocated to the Somerast, Peterborough and Suffolk areas for stacking and thatching and a considerable number of women are now     &apos;being trained for that purpose.Ordnance Survey.During the week ending 14th August 1918, 164,976 maps were sent Overseas, 3,379 to the War Office, 3,131 to the Air Ministry, 8,639 to the Admiralty, and 455 to Other Services. The number of maps printed at Overseas Branch, Ordnance Survey, during Suly was 178,748.Joint Committee of the Board, of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Ministry of Food.Representations have been made to the Committee during the week that a more liberal supply of Cotton Cak$ for Kilch cows should be made available during and after Hayeel when it ie much needed.    A recommendation has also been received that evidence of the working of the live and dead weight systems should be compared and published in the Journals of the Board of Agriculture and Ministry of Food, and in som-3 convenient form suitable for circulation and distribution to1farmers *At a Meeting of the Joint Committees District Representatives for one of the Eastern Counties, a recommendation: was passed that farmers should, if possible, be allowed to use more of their homs- rovm Barley for feeding pigs and also be allowed to supply agricultural labourers and smallholders with meal for piss kept by them.    The Conference considered this aspect of the question of some importance &quot;in view of the impetus which is likely to be given to the roaring of pigs under the auspices of the Horticultural Committees who are advocating the formation of pig clubs and similar institutions&quot;.Diseases of Animals Branch.The number of outbreaks of Swine Fever confirmed during the weak was 30 and a3 the number of suspectad cases reported was 270 it may bs accepted that there Is littls concealment of this disease.    Of the 36 suspected cases of Anthrax only 4 v/sre confirmed.   Tho steps taken to deal with Parasitic Kanga appear to be having a very good sffoct as there were only 27 outbreaks
during thfl w*pk wher^Ata th* avVraga for the 32 week* lea little over 100.    The opening of new markets or * grading centres1 to meet the views of the Ministry of Food have caused a number of inquiries as to compliance with the Market and Sales Order, and the Weighing of Cattle Acts.    Exemptions with regard to the provisions of the former have been given freely in order to- meet the position.Pig Production Section.A meeting of the Advisory Committee was held on the 6th. The members present were unanimous, as to the position   in respect to obtaining feeding stuffs being disastrous as to pig production. The correspondence coming to the Seotion now refers to little else than the difficulty in obtaining feeding stuffs, and it would appear that it is not so much the acknowledged shortage as the inequality of distribution.    Complaints are also numerous as to the worthless material put on the market as &apos;pig meal&apos; at a price that is preposterous.Publications BranciwThe number of     applications for ordinary issues of the leaflets was 1734, in response to which 4914 copies of Leaflets were despatched.    In addition 16,700 copies of Leaflets were despatched to applicants for supplies in bulk for distribution.fisheries Division.dministratiye section.The Board have applied t% the Treasury for sanction to the payment of the British contribution to the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea for 1918-19:   it is of importance to maintain this organisation in being with a view to continuing the research work after the War:   some investigations are still carried out and reports on work done are being prepared.Orders relaxing restrictions on fishing operations in the Severn, Wye and Yorkshire Salmon districts, as well as in the sea and portions of the East Coast have been drafted.    Proposals for the insurance as against war risks of Icelandic trawlers fishing froja English ports are under consideration.    Several cases of pollution of Rivers have arisen.    The Board have no power to interfere in these matters, but they have assisted the local Fishery Authorities by obtaining reports of analysis of samples of water, and, in some cases, they have communicated direct with the firms concerned in the hope of securing some treatment of the effluent.I shopmen&apos;s Registration and Recruiting Section.A list of ninety-nine men has been despatched to the Admiralty to enable the 200 men required for Call XV. to be completed.    A letter has been sent to the Admiralty conveying a reasoned refusal of the Board to concur in the call of further fishermen from England and Wales pending the adjustment of English and Scottish contributions, and the results of the proposed enquiry.lor Loan Committoe.The total number of engined fishing-boats put into commission through the operation of the Kotor Loan Scheme up to the end of July 1916, is 140.    Of these eight are boats bought with engines already installed.    Three outboard motors have been supplied.     Of the remaining 129 installations, 97 were directed from the London Office, and 32 carried *ut independently in the S,W. Area.    These figures represent only work actually completed
by th* end of July and take no account of installations in hand.th Food Committee.The work of the Committee during the past week has heen I   largely concerned in obtaining essential supplies for the fishing 1   &quot;boats.      Steps arc &quot;being tekeh to ensura if possible adequate I   supplies of coal paraffin, petrol and carbide for the herringfishing at Yarmouth and Lowestoft.    A representative of the Boardhas made preliminary enquiries at those places.
