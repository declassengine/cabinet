FOOD PRODUCTION SCHEMES, IRELAND.

Memorandum prepared in compliance with Chief Secretary&apos;s Minute of 17th March, 1917.

Week ended 14th August, 1918.

The following is a brief statement on the work of the Department during the past week in furtherance of increased Food Production in Ireland:-

LOANS FOR AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS.

Seventy applications for loans for agricultural implements were received by the Department during the past week. The total value of machinery ordered from the beginning of the present year, to date, under the Scheme, amounts to Â£62,893.

COMPULSORY TILLAGE - LAND INSPECTION.

Five additional Temporary Inspectors have been appointed and are now at work, making a total of 50 Temporary Inspectors at present engaged on land inspections.

FLAX.

The various strikes among farm labourers which interupted flax pulling and retting operations appear to have been settled temporarily, and the harvesting of the flax crop is now on the whole proceeding satisfactorily. The resentment which flaxgrowers feel over? the award of the Arbitration Court, as to rates of wages for pulling and handling operations, is having a very marked influence with regard to their attitude towards reserving portion of their flax crop for seed purposes, many growers apparently proposing to save for seed purposes only the mere minimum required under the flaxseed (Ireland) Order, 1918.

The position of flaxgrowing as affected by the labour troubles and the increases in the wages of workers was considered at a special, urgently summoned meeting of the Department&apos;s Advisory? Committee on Flax Growing, held on the 10th instant. In view of the increased cost of production the Committee recommended that the priced already fixed for flax of the 1918 crop should be increased by 5/- per stone. Such an increase would, the Committee consider? have a beneficial effect on the attitude of farmers towarde flax growing next year.

14/8/l8.
PROGRESS OF CROPS.

The weather during the week, which was dull with occasional showers, was unfavourable for the saving of old meadow hay. The bulk of the hay crop has, however, been saved in good condition.

Potato blight is reported to be spreading rather rapidly in several counties, especially on farms were spraying was neglected. The crop in general is promising, although the yield is not expected to equal that of last year. Grain crops are now ripening fast. Cutting of barley and oats has commenced in early districts and will be in progress generally in the course of another week. Spring sown wheat is on the whole not likely to prove a satisfactory crop this year. Winter wheat and other corn crops promise an average yield of grain and a rather light yield of straw. Rape and other "catch crops" and being sown in several counties. The Department&apos;s Agricultural staff are endeavouring to secure an extension of the area sown under these crops, the produce of which will prove especially useful in supplementing supplies of hay and roots in the coming spring season.

CATTLE FEEDING STUFFS.

The Department have formulated a scheme for the distribution of Ireland&apos;s proportion of feeding cakes and meals for the period of June-August, 1918, delivery of which have been in arrear; and, as a result, it is hoped that supplies of these essential feeding stuffs will very soon be procurable by farmers in this country.

MAINTENANCE OF LIVE STOCK.

During the period from 6th to 12th instant, inclusive, ?200 applications for licences to slaughter or export heifers and 45 applications for licences to expert store heifers were received. Thirty-five applications for licences to slaughter bulls or bullocks were also received.
