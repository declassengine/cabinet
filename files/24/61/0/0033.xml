Week ended 10th August, 1918.naval operations.mines have been laid in the north sea, in the heligoland bight, off the belgian coast, North Sea. and off the east coast of england.On 5th august five enemy airships whilst attempting a raid on this country were attacked by our machines. none of the airships crossed the coast line and three were brought to action, one being shot down in flames 10 miles from the coast, near the wash, and another being damaged. the airship brought down was of the newest type of zeppelin and carried the commander of the airship squadron. one of our machines crashed on landing and another failed to return.On 10th august a large america seaplane on patrol from killingholme sighted and chased a zeppelin, but was unable to overtake it.In addition to patrols which have been carried out in various areas by R.

Mediter-ranean,During the week flying has again been interfered with by unfavourable weather, but six enemy machines have been destroyed and one driven down out of control. None of our machines are missing.On the night of the 6th-7th August enemy aircraft dropped from 60 to 70 bombs in the Dunkirk area, but no damage was caused to our Air Station.On 9th August sixteen 230-lb. bombs were dropped on enemy minesweepers off Zeebrugge. On the same day a sunken German destroyer, which had probably been sunk by a British mine, was located eight miles N.W. of Zeebrugge.On 10th August bombs were dropped on enemy destroyers off De Haan, a direct hit being obtained on one of them ; a quarter of an hour later a very large explosion was observed in the direction of the damaged destroyer.On 7th August nine of our machines from Otranto raided Durazzo, about a ton of bombs being dropped on the seaplane base. Six direct hits were observed and a large fire was started.  All our machines returned safely.Casualties.        On 6th August the destroyer &quot; Comet,&quot; whilst being towed to Syracuse after being damaged by collision, was torpedoed and sunk by an enemy submarine 47 miles from [ Cape Passaro, two officers and five men being lost.Submarines operating.Actions with enemy submarines.ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.During the week under review there was a considerable reduction in the number of large enemy submarines operating, only 16 of a type which operates further afield than the North Sea having been located. Among these were three of the &quot;cruiser&quot; type, one of which was in the vicinity of Cape Hatteras, one off Nova Scotia, and the third between Ireland and the Azores. There appears to have been a small concentration of four enemy submarines off the North Coast of Ireland during the week, but they inflicted no damage, and after a few days the operation was abandoned. The Irish Sea was almost entirely free of submarines during the week and a great reduction in activity was experienced off the East Coast, but in the English Channel, particularly to the east of Portland, enemy submarines have been considerably more active than during recent weeks.The following Table shows the number of actions between Allied craft and enemy submarines which are reported to have taken place in all waters during recent weeks and the nature of the craft which have been engaged ; and also the number of submarines which have been destroyed or lost to the enemy as the result of such actions : 	Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		July 20th.

The percentage of losses to sailings of such vessels engaged in Overseas trades is 1.49 as against .52 last aveek, in Cross-Channel trades is .48 as against .74, and in Coasting trades is .29 as against .07 in the previous week, while the percentage, reckoning all the United Kingdom trades together, is this week .75 as against .42 in the previous week.The Table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all merchant vessels, Foreign Areas as well as British, sunk, damaged and unsuccessfully attacked in the last two weeks by enemy m which craft and by mine, classified according to areas. vessels lost.The most marked feature of the week is the almost complete cessation of activity in the North Sea and the Irish Sea and its transfer to the English Channel, where eight vessels were sunk or damaged and two others unsuccessfully attacked during the week. There is also some increase of activity observable in the Atlantic (Southern) area owing to submarine operations in the vicinity and to the westward of Ushant.The number of British and Foreign merchant vessels sailing in organised Convoy Vessel which completed their voyages during last week, and the losses sustained whilst in such convoyed.

ENEMY MINES.During the week under review enemy minelaying activity in Home Waters has been Minelaying. confined to the Plymouth and Falniouth areas, mines having been laid off those ports apparently by- the same submarine. This is the first occasion on which mines have been laid in these areas since May, 1918, no Flanders submarine having laid mines to the westward of Portsmouth during the interval. The situation oil&apos; the East Coast of Scotland is now satisfactory, there being relatively only a few mines still unaccounted for.Idle following Table shows the number of enemy mines destroyed and British vessels Casualties, sunk by mine in Home Waters (including the Havre and Cherbourg areas) in recent weeks : Week Ended.

During the week under review seven enemy merchant ships arrived at and seven Merchant-sailed from Norwegian ports outside the Cattegat.   No enemy ships have entered or left mm-Rotterdam, but three small enemy steamships have arrived at Harlingen from the Rhine.FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.Russia.No change of importance is reported from Archangel, where the local situation is satisfactory. The Bolshevik forces, who are assisted by Germany, have retired to Oboserskaya a few miles south of Archangel having destroyed railway bridges and attempted other damage to the railway as they went. General Poole is awaiting reinforcements and has, meanwhile, sent a reconnaissance party up the Northern Dvina towards Kotlas. At the same time as the recent coup took place at Archangel, a landing was effected at Onega by a force which has moved towards the Archangel railway, but has temporarily been held up about 20 miles west of Oboserskaya.No operation is reported from the Murman district, but the Germans appear to be making considerable progress in the construction of a light railway on the road from Rovaniemi to Kyro..  The Germans have withdraavn their troops in occupation of the Aland Islands, and are also dispatching troops from Finland to the Western Front.It is reliably reported that the Germans are training crews for the Russian submarines at Sevastopol, but that the Russian officers refuse to give assistance. It is also stated that the permanent occupation of the dockyard at Sevastopol is seriously contemplated by.the Germans.The Allied expeditionary force to the Far Bast will probably consist of about 25,000 men, and will be employed elsewhere than at Vladivostok if required. The first British and French contingents have arrived and have left to support the Czechs on the Ussuri Front.Spain.&quot;Consequent upon Admiral Miranda taking up the post of Minister of Marine, Vice-Admiral Don Ignacio Pintado has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Instructional Squadron, and Vice-Admiral Don Joaquin de Rubalcava has relieved Vice-Admiral Pintado as Commander-in-Chief at Ferrol.Naval Staff,loth August, 1918.
