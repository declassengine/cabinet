1* WAR 0ABIM!*,TGorn Prices for Harvest of 1918&quot;. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Agriculture.In 1917 the Food Controller and the Board of Agriculture, unable to agree on prices of agricultural produce, referred them tc the War Cabinet.   The Cabinet referred the matter to lord Milner, whose decision of July 18, 1917, confirmed by the War Cabinet on July 19, 1917 (War Cabinet MAimfrs 190). was that the price of home-grown wheat should be 72/* per quarter (480 lbs.), and that the prices of barley and oats should be on a parity with the price of wheat.The food Controller proposes to issue an Order governing cereal prices for the 1918 harvest, and to cive a slight rise in the price of barley and oats, but to make no change in that of wheat.   In reaching this decision the Food Controller departs from the parity of prices for cereals sanctioned by the War Cabinet in 1917, and has not followed the advice of the Board or of the Central Agricultural Advisory Council.Following the precedent of 1917, I ask for a Cabinet decision on cereal prices.A 10$ to 12$ rise on the 1917 prices for wheat, barley and oats was recommended by the Board and the Council on the following grounds;-1.    Increased harvest wages.2.    The extra labour required to harvest crops which have been laid by the storms, and to make good the inexperience of many of the workers.3.    The reduction in the yield per acre and the additional cost of production, consequent on the cropping of inferior land in response to the appeal of the Govern-ment for more cereals, and particularly for more wheat.4,    The general increase in all farm expenses, such asimplements, binder twine, oil and engine fuel, horses and horse-keep, thatching, threshing, repairs and renewals, etc.All three oereals alike are similarly affected by these increases in the cost of production.   The Food Controller admits the additional expense as a justification for a rise in prices of barley and oats, but not in the case of wheat.   The parity that has hitherto been maintained between the prices of the three cereals is destroyed, and oats and barley receive preferential treatment as against vrheat, the cereal which the farmer has been informed is most needed by the country.   In England wtot is the principal grain crop; little is grown in Scotland, Ireland or Wales.   Thus England receives less favourable treatment than othei parts of the United Kingdom in respect of its staple corn product.The effect of an Order such as that proposed by the Food Controller will, in my opinion, be to reduce the English wheat area in 1919.(This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;a government)*
However, the chief grievance of the fanner against the proposed prices is that he is compelled to sell his corn at lower prices than those at which he can obtain any other food for his stock.   At the prices ruling for meat, it will pay the farmer to convert all his corn, including wheat, into meat or milk.   He is only allowed to retain a minimum amount of hay;   he is told to sell all his barley;   he is asked to sell as much oats as possible; - all at prices which are much below the prices of any food by which they can be replaoed. The case of barley shows this most strikingly.   Barley is wanted &quot;by the Ilinistry of Pood for two purposes; - (l) for the brewers, who are both able and Y/illing to give a higher price than the Pood Controller wishes to fix;   (2)   for diluting flour, not because there is any special shortage, but because barley forms a more attractive diluent than maize.   The Pood Controller proposes to take ;the farmerfs barley at an artificially low prioe fi;:ed by himself, and to sell him in exchange maize at the much higher price which it costs on importation.   All the foods sold to farmers by the Kinistry of Pood, whether maize, Canadian oats, broken grain and sweepings, even the offals from their own corn, are dearer as food than the hay, barley, and oats taken from them at the proposed prices.   TheEood Controller, in fact, insists on making a profit out of the grain at the prices at which he compels farmers to sell to him, on the plea that the general cost to the Exchequer of the subsidised loaf will be increased unless he is able to reduce the cost of American, by the profit that he makes on British, grain.   It&apos;is not asked that British farmers should be paid the full price of American grain when imported.   But it is strongly urged that the prices should not be so manipulated against British farmers as to make it impossible for them to maintain their live-stook.   It is clear that, if barley is taken from the farmers, pig-keeping will be further reduced.   If, again, offals are to be reduced by the importation of flour instead of wheat, on what are British live-stock to be maintained?   X am not prepared to aocept American maize in exohange at the sort of price at which it can be landed here.   To do so, would be to put ourselves entirely in the hands of the American producer, both for grain and meat.I therefore ask, on behalf of the English producer -(1)   An increased price for wheat;(2.)   Such a price for barley as the brewer is willing to pay for whatever is required for brewing, the rest of the crop to be left to the farmer for feeding purposes;(3)   An increased price for the oats sold to the town horse-keeper and the Army;   the bulk of -the oats will be consumed on the farm, in which case the price fixed makes no difference.It is difficult to disregard the prospect of our increased dependence on the United States for both bread and meattt   The interests of British producers are not represented at the deliberations of the Allied Pood Controllers, while, in the case of Prance, the Minister of Agriculture is also Pood Controller.
Mr. Hoover, at the Mansion House, on Wednesday, July 24, 1918, &quot;based Mthe world1s food strategy&quot; on production. &quot;Production&quot;, he said, &quot;is the very foundation of our hopes .... &quot;The cost of production is a secondary matter to empty stomachs&quot;. On these lines the United States proceed.   In pre-war times, owing to the lesser cost of production, the prices for wheat paid to American farmers at Chicago or Minneapolis were less than those paid to farmers in this country.   To-day they are higher, and a further rise is anticipated in 1919.   English farmers are differently treated.   In order to be able to encourage American producers of wheat and keep down the price of bread in this country, English wheat growers are to receive . less net profit than they had in 1917.   The effect mus^ I submit, be to reverse the Government policy of stimulating wheat production in this country.E.E. PROTHERO.15th August, 1918.
