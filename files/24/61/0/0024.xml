However great his reluctance to dissipate his Air strength, ho will be compelled to- with-draw a proportion of fighting machines for purposes of Home Defence and to divert new formations to the same end.Conversely it is considered that any delay in the development of our Independent Air Striking forces must ultimately teact to the detriment of the Royal Air Force contigents operating with the Navy and Army,   If the initiative in long distance bombing be once allowed to pass J into the hands of the enemy, it is anticipated that there\ will ensue a wide-spread demand for increased anti-aircraftI defences throughout the large industrial centres of England.It would be exceedingly difficult to cope with such a demand and any attempt to do so would inevitably result in the diver-8ion of a considerable strength of men and material (inespecial
2.63especial of aircraft) from the battle fronts, particularly from France.The best measure by which this eventuality may be fore stalled is to build up striking forces which will attack the enemy&apos;s long range bombing before it can develop. Accordingly any diversion at the present juncture for the development of our Independent Forces will prove a safe-guard against the very possible necessity of diverting still larger contingents at a future date for purposes of home Defence.Moreover, it is to be borne in mind that suitable squadrons of these&apos;Independent Forces, once constituted, will be available on groat emergency to support those portions of the Air Force oo-operating with the Navy or Army.   Thus, should the submarine menace show signs of an acute development a number of bombing squadrons could be temporarily diverted for anti-submarine operations. Again, in the improbable event of the enemy attempting an overwhelming concentration of his Air Forces on the Western Front, irrespective of his neods elsewhere, it would be possible quickly to effect a counter-concentra-tion by a similar temporary diversion.Further, both the Navy and the Armies in the Field, together with their respective Air Force contingents should reap direct advantage once the independent offensive arm is in operation.   For example, a series of successful attacks on submarine bases and the centres of submarine production must materially restrict tne enemy&apos;s campaign at sea, in which event it would be possibly to effect a reduction in the number of anti-submarine patrols carried out by aircraft.   Similarly continuous bombing of the enemy&apos;s Air bases and the towns which house the hulk of his aircraft industries will render it increasingly diffi-cult for him to make good the wastage in his squadrons on the battle fronts.Finally, it must be remembered that the strength of the Air Force at any time is not to be measured solely by the number of squadrons in the Field.     The quality of machines and personnel is an equally important criterion. There is every reason to believe that in these respects the efficiency of our squadrons in the Field and their consequent relative value will be considerably enhanced in the future, thanks to the adoption of improved techni-cal designs and the re-organised system of training now in force for our pilots and observers, whilst as regards the former at least tne enemy is likely to suffer from undue concentration on a single type of engine which is thought to be incapable of further development.The types of squadrons in which it is thought praccic-able to effect economy and the numbers to be provided from the Navy and Army allotments respectively, together with their prospective allocation to the Independent Forces to be based on France and England, are shown in the attach-ed schedule &quot;A&quot;, to which are appended copies of letters to the Admiralty and War Office respectively detailing the grounds for these amendments and their scope.
(sd)   w.A. ROBINSON.It will be noted that provision has &quot;been made for the formation of an unallotted emergency reserve consisting of   22 squadrons.     This reserve is t^be hold to meet emergencies as they arise, and will/tempornr-. ily alloc ait od at the discretion of the Air Council to the Navy, Army or Independent Forces in accordance with the exigencies of the Air situation as a whole during the coming months.I am to add that the Air Council do not anticipate that it&apos; will be practicable for the V/ar Cabinet to discuss these proposals in detail, and am to suggest that this paper be circulated and referred to the Air Policy Committee for recommendations.In conclusion I am again to emphasize the fact that, in the opinion of the Air Council, e^xlyjsanction of the pro-posal3 above outlined is essential ireTrect is to be given to the declared policy of the Air Staff. - namely, sufficient expansion of the Air Forces contingents now co-operating with the Navy and the Armies in the Field to assure the maintenance of our present relative superiority . over the enemy and concurrently the utilisation of all available resources both of men and material, with a view to the rapid development of Independent Strategic Striking Forces.* I am,Sir,Your obedient servant
