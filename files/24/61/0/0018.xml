CIRCULATED TO THT&apos;.l KING AMD WAR CABINET.QOA^Lord R. Cecil..,1, I attach aManorandun prepared by this Departmerit briefly dealing v/ith our coal situation so far as regards our obligations to neutral countries.&quot; The matter appears to me to be a very urgent one and unless some immediate remedial steps are taken it is likely to bring about a crisis which must undoubted-ly affect our relationship with neutral countries regarding the shipping which they place at the dis-posal of the Allieso2. The Norwegian Minister has constantly seen me oflate: on this subject and as a result of his inter-views I put forward a suggestion that a mesting should at once be held between the Foreign Office, the Coal Controller and the Minister of Shipping,   I have today seen the Minister of Shipping and hs considers that such a meeting would be of no use, but that the matter-ought to be referred at once to the Cabineta 3, The difficulty of the position is this;   thatwhatever
whatever steps v-re may take to meet our obligations to neutral countries, the fact remains that any Increase of coal rent to then will only diminish our ^replies either for use in this country or for tho service of our Allies.   We -any effectually cure the evil in one direction ley accentuating it in others.The coal problem has now reached e very dangerous point :ur,I I am convinced that there is only one means by e&quot;hieh it can he solved, and, that is at&apos;once to increase the output of coal in this country,A, We are threatened with a rupture in our relationships - 1th the  reat ship-o^miirjg neutrals,B. The Shinpinr; Controller informs me that there are threatenings of difficulties with Anerica with regard to our coal position;   andC   So far as our Allies are concerned, the -situation has become critics! and these evils will become accentuated in the very immediate future unless something is done at once. The only solution appears to be, that the Cabinet should(1) At once put back a lar^e number of men into thecoal fields, (2) Take immediate steps to remedy the gravesituation which has arisen- iv. regard to Norway and other neutral countries,(Signed)   ?, Leverton Harris.15th August 19IB.
3o ;   . .   &apos;On the supply of coal to neutral countries inEurope.On May 24th the War Cabinet   decided   that!,Lord Robert Cecil should sum on a Conmittee consisting of representatives of the Foreiri) Office,&apos;the Board of Trade, and the Ministry of Shipping, to ^o into the question of the demands of foreign countries for coal, and that this Comriitee should work in close co-operation with the deal   : Controller, and endeavour to relieve him &quot;here possible of some of the obligations in this direction.fiThe Ccrmi ittee found tiiat the full amounts promised to neutral countries in Europe, via., Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Spain, amounted, to 662,000 tons per month, that during the first five months of 1918 these countries had only actually applied for about 348,000 tons per month; but that an increase in appli-cations from the above-mentioned neutral countries was to be anticipated and that His Majesty&apos;s Government might shortly have to promise 100,000 tons a month to Holland, in that case increasing our obligations to 762,000 tons a month.They decided that it would be sufficient if the Coal Controller were to provide 540,000 tons a month for all the above-mentioned neutrals including Holland,but
but that this was the irre   ilble minimum 9Diving June and July neutrals applied for a quantity of coal which was less than this minimum figure;   owing however to the reduced output of coal it was only possible to ship to them during June 314,000 tons and during July 285,000 tons,   The Foreign Office have no reason to anticipate that the situation will grow easier in the near future.The Foreign Office consider it vital that His Majesty:s Government should be able fully to meet the applications of neutral countries within the limits which are set out above, viz., 540,000 tens. In return for promises to supply coal Hi^Ma^er-tyls Government have secured the services of large blocks of neutral tonnage (noteless than 1,000,000 dead weight tons.)    If we cannot fulfil our promises we shall have no claim to retain this tonnage.   Besides this the breakdown of the coal and tonnage agreements with neutral countries would endenger the importation in to the United Kingdom of essential products from those countries, would weaken the hold exercised over tiierantfor purposes of the Blockade, would expose them to greater pressure from Germany, would react disas-trously on our prestige in, and political relations with those countries and would prejudice our position in any future negotiations with them.-FOREIGN OFFICE,August 15th, 1918,
