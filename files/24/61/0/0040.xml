*EC RET,$JK 5449,WAR   CABINETLEAJCAGB OP II^OHHATION. Note by the SecretaryIn accordance with the decision of the War Cabinet on August 16, (War Cabinet 460, Minute 3) I saw Mr. Geoffrey Dawson, the Editor of &quot;The Times&quot; yesterday afternoon.     He bold me that four or five days ago he had heard whispers that &quot;some decision had been taken in regard to the continuance of the Imperial War Cabinet, and had asked his Colonial expert to make inquiries.   The result had been that he had learned practically full particulars of what was intended.   On the whole, however, he thought it was better for the moment to publish nothing.   On Thursday afternoon one of his Staff reported to him that this question was common knowledge and being talked of widely, and that there could be no possible objection to publication.   Mr., Geoffrey Daws on himself was very busy at, the moment, and did not go into it carefully, but authorised publication. Re assured me that his decision had no connection with the Committee of Prime Ministers, and from a comparison of times it would seem that his decision was taken before the Committee of Prime Ministers brpke up,I then pressed him as to the source from which his represen-tative had obtained the information.   He replied that, for the moment, he frankly did not know, but promised to make inquiries, He said, however, that he had very little doubt that it came from Dom-inion sources.    Some of the Dominion Ministers are either aocom-panied by, or, at any rate, are very intimate with, journalists from their Dominions, to whom they would probably not hesitate to speak freely on a matter of this kind, which is not of the first order of secrecy.     I gathered the impression that this is the souroe from which &quot;The Times&apos;&apos; moet probably derived its information.Later in the evening Mr. Geoffrey Dawson endeavoured( to communicate with me by telephone, but I was unfortunately with the Prime Minister.   He delivered the following message to my Private Secretary, Mr. Sylvester, who took it down in shorthandi-&quot;As far as I have gone at present I have founds roughly, how the news came to us, and it came solely from Dominion sources, and had nothing to do with any English official at all.   What is more, it was given to our people in pub-lic conversation as bein&amp; a fait ac-oomp^i, and as being about to be published, either &quot;&quot;in *The Times&apos;, or in some form or other elsewhere.    This confirms the impression I had yesterday that the thin^ was public property.&quot;(Signed) MaP.A.Hankey, Secretary.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., August 17, 1918.IpHIS DOCUMENT IS THE  ROESOT OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJHJSTTS GOBRMEIIT). ,     *
