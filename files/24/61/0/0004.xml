The article is by Valfrcdcontributes to a number of Swedish provincial papers and to Norwegian papers in Ironcilgora and Bergen, and is entitled &quot;The Turn&quot;.:represented in certain Pan-German Berlin circles, that German shares in Sweden have sunk latterly just in those quarters in Sweden in which they stood highest:   it-results from the German menace having become so evident that even the blind are begin-ning to see it.    The German domination of the Baltic has brought about what the German irruption into Belgium and the menace to the worHd from German military power had not suf-cocd-ed in doing.    We have lived under the pressure of a Russian danger which each individual felt and against this it was be-Moved that thelnterest of the German Empire in preventing Russian expansion would provide protection.    There was a pre-valent belief that it was thanks to Germany that Russia had not sucoeeded in accomplishing her wish tc turn Aland into a Russian fortress.    Vie now know, through what has come to light, that on the contrary Germany in 19C7 secretly accorded/toSpangberg, an observant and competent Liberal ;jcurnalist, whoIt is not the fault of the German Ambassadcr, as has been
to Russia the desired right.    This revelation struck a hardblow at the oonfidenc-e reposed in German policy and when, inthe Spring, German troops were sent to the llando in order, aswas openly proclaimed in the German Government press, to roundoff operations in the Baltic and to assure to Germany the un-disturbed dominion over the Gulf of Finland and&quot;the Baltic, this(a)was too much even for &quot;Nye Dagligt Allehanda&quot;.       However much the attempt was made to put the &quot;blame for German Intervention in Finland on to the shoulders of the Swedish Government because it did not act as the Finns desired, there is no getting away from the fact that no leading Swedish politician dared to advo-cate Swedish military intervention or to deny that the German ditto might in any case, have taken place,   t With the German occupation of Finland and the Russian shores of the Baltic, Ger-many steps into Russia&apos;s old place as a Baltic Power, while at the same time retaining her own.    The Russian danger has baen replaced by a German    tf another kind it is true, - but eoono-mically and politically more threatening than ever the Russian was&apos;.    The events in Finland of the last few months, combined with the pressure to which the Swedish elements there have been subjected, and the ungracious treatment of the Sv/edish offioers who participated in the War, have strengthened the impression of what has happened and the control which Germany has seized ever the sea-traffic in the Baltic and the trade with Russia have done still more in that direction.That is the reason for the change whioh has taken place in Swedish opinion as to what a German victory would mean. It is no fancy of Mr, Brantin^s that German-inclined opinion in Sweden has latterly significantly lost ground.    A character^ iatio expression of this is the warning uttered just in theset i       t     /days (w) One tf the most pro-German papers in Sweden.
&quot;days Vy^StooJWhoGLms DagTxLad^    ctmoerning the German danger. It hm ptinted out that Gorman polioy after the War will pro-bably attempt to bring the. Scandinavian countries under its influence.    &quot;Such endeavours&quot;, the article continues, &quot;will not find sympathy in the majority of the Swedish nation.    We are right willing to maintain good and friendly connections with all the great Powers, not least with Germany, but we are not for that reason inclined to renounce our liberty and right ef self-determination in order helplessly to be led in the leading-strings ef another Power.    As regards1 this most of us Swedes are united&quot;.There is no doubt that we are so, Just as we are united in the feeling that the only hope of salvation lies in the de-velopment of a co-operation whloh, under the pressuro of the world war, has been initiated between the Scandinavian peeples. !Fhe obstacles in the way, due to the different orientations in $foreign policy, have to a certain degree been smoothed away by the force of circumstances.    Sweden no longer stands as it formerly did, hypnotised by the Russian danger, and Uor-way perhaps appreciates more strongly than before the neces-Sity for a counter-weight te the English influence Just as Sweden does vis-^-vis the German.    That, in Sweden, eyes are beginning to be opened to the German danger after having up to now only recognised the Russian is a fact which deserves te be noted both at home and abroad.    There is nothing in confliot with neutrality if we add to this an expression of the hope that the War shall be brought to a conclusion which will ward off the German danger without putting in its place an.English cran American.    It is in the clearest interests of the neutral nations to wish for a peace which permits them tomaintain their neutrality and avoid being swallowed up by an __    -3- all-dominating(s) A pro-German Conservative paper.
all-dominating Great Power.    At the present moment it is the German danger which is the greatest and for that reason our first hope must be that it will be deflected.    Through ICtthl-mann!s resignation of his post as Foreign Secretary, it has been made clear that German policy is still guided by the military leaders whose peace programme has been expressed by Hindenburg thus:   &quot;It is to be hoped that the Uar will last until our enemies bend to our will&quot;.     Such a peace not only means a crushing defeat for the enomies of Germany, but also that the position of the neutral nations will be made unten-able.    A German victory-peace means the breakdown of neutral-ity.     Should it not then be permitted to neutral citise.c.s openly to express their hope for a peaco which will ensure the rights of neutrals?
