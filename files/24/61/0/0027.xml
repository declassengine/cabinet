(1).Refmnct No.14 th August, 1918.Sir,I beg to submit the following Report of the work of the Pood Production Department for the week ended 13th August:-The Weather and Condition of Crops.The effect of the heavy rains which fell during July combined with the warm sunny weather experienced last week is now&apos; appearing in the greatly improved condition of both cereal and -root crops.A record wheat crop, is expected in many districts and oats, potatoes and roots all promise a far heavier yield than was anticipated a few weeks ago..   The harvest outlook is, therefore, most promising.LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION. . :Agricultural Executive Committees. -:- &apos;The meetings of the Agricultural Executive Committees are largely suspended during the harvesting season and consequently there is little action under the Defence of the Realm Regulations !. to report. . - v.-&quot; -Prosecution - In Cambridgeshire,a&apos;large farmer near Newmarket . was fined  75 for refusing, to;-Carry out an order to break up 24   -acres of grass land in Soham .Pen.     A farmer was fined  20 and. &quot;  10 costs for failure to plough and sow with corn or potatoes.-4 acres of land at EnfieId,. Middlesex.     In Breconshire a farmer failing to comply with ploughing orders served upon him was fined - -  25. .... -; &apos;
petermination of Tenancies - During the veek 2 Orders hnve been made by the Department determining tenancies on aoc-ount of bad&apos; farming in respect of 4 acres.HORTICULTURAL DIVISION. Provision of LandJor Allotments - Reports received from 1,184 districts show that 314^882 applications have been made for plot under the Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (l.io.2), and that 289,799 plots containing 20,931 acres have been provided.During the week three local authorities have agreed to &quot;acquire for next season, in addition to the area mentioned above 36 acres (510 allotments), including an additional 22 acres at Middlesborough.    The Department has been able to arrange in thr;f cases for a continuance of tenancy where ^notices to quit&apos; allotme: I had&apos;been served.Fruit Section - Negotiations have been opened with regard to the arrangements for supplies of glass ,jars for.fruit preservation next season.    The total number of glass jars delivered by the :manufacturers up to July 20th was 4,034,028*Owing to the shortage of the fruit crop the programme of demonstrations in fruit and vegetable preservation is coming tcend rather sooner&apos;this year than last, as the demand for. &apos; idemonstrations has fallen off considerably. , 66 demonstrations * in fruit and vegetable preservation have been &quot;held In the provini during the past week,Marketing - An Important conference convened by the Horticultural Sub-Committee for Surrey was held on the 9th instant and was&apos; attended by representatives of all the District Committees.    The obiect of the meeting was to inform Commit tees.of the county soli and to urge the importance of local effort -to ensure surplus proc finding a market.     As an indication of the usefulness of local marketing organisations It was mentioned by a delegate that the&apos; County marketing Society received from 121 allotment holders in Farnham 18 cwt. of raspberries which&apos;would not have otherwise found their way into the open market.
A County Society has been formed in Essex, and it is hoped that a District Depot will be immediately started at Southead.In &apos;V or costers hire an example of the usefulness of the Marketing Society is shown by the fact that a small grower who wished to give the Society a trial obtained  11, 17. 6. at the Society&apos;s auction mart for the produce of four apple trees, for which he had previously received an offer of 38/6d. from a,dealer. General - An inspection of allotments at Ruskin Park, Camberwe11y , showed that potato disease is &quot;prevalent, and in many cases the crop is a partial failure, due apparently in every case to the planting of home-saved seed.   Every plot planted with seed direct from Scotland&apos; or Ireland looks well and appears to be free from disease.TECHNICAL DIVISION. Inspection of Land.   (1) In the course of an inspection of newly broken grass land in Wiltshire, some fine wheat crops were seen. One of the crops growing on the Downs, from 500 to 700 ft. above sea level, consisted of an unbroken stretch of about 250 acres, estimated to yield from 35 to 40 bushels per acre.   The crop was standing remarkably well in spite of its weight and of the heavy rain which fell on August 2nd.   This the farmer attributed to the fact that it had been sown very early.,.&apos;The downland was broken up in 1917, wheat sowing began on July 28th and was completed before the end of iiugust. It is doubtful if now, or at any previous period, so large a quantity of wheat has been seen in one stretch in England.(2) Eelow the Downs,-in the Pewsey Vale, a second remarkable wheat crop was inspected. A good old pasture of 52 acres had been broken up by steam tackle in July . and iiugust 1917. The farmer has now cut a crop estimated to yield 8 quarters per acre. It is under-I stood that a local valuer expressed the opinion that the ploughing of this field has depreciated the value of the farm by  1,000. This opinion brings into sharp contrast the national and conventional
views of the value of lend, for the field has produced this year more human food than it would do in four years if grazed bj cows or in fourteen years if grazed by fattening bullocks. Seed Testing LtatIon.   The second seed testing year commenced on the 1st instant.    The first annual report is in preparation; for publication in the Journal of the Board of Agriculture. Luring the season 1917-18, 7,744 samples were received;   of thes5,676 were sent by 492 seedsmen, 1,553 by 772 farmers, and 515 were tested for the Department and other public bodies.    The total cash receipts were  775. 15. 4.have been received, which indicates that the new regulations with regard to vegetable seeds are already taking effect.   Forty seed merchants have already opened deposit accounts for the current (second) season.Chapperton Down Range, Salisbury Plain.   Complaints having been received as to the difficulty of farming land within the radius of this range, an inspection was made and several of the farmers interested were interviewed.    The total area occupied by the military authorities for the purposes of the range is about 5,000 acres, of &quot;?hich nearly one-half Is under arable cultivation It is now proposed to include a further area of about 2,500 acres within the &quot;danger&quot; zone.     It seems unlikely that the farmers can continue to maintain the ordinary cultivation of the land under the conditions prevailing, and suggestions are being made for using the land to the best advantage from the point of vlc-v of food production.LABOUR DIVISION. Labour troubles which had arisen in the neighbourhood of Salisbury, and in the counties of Cambridge and test Suffolk, have been enquired into by the Department and are now believed to be satisfactorily settled.      In all cases the disputes have been in connection with wages.     At Salisbury the farm labourersDuring the last three weeks 250 samples, mostly vegetabl
0 0 0 were dissatisfied owing to the high wages paid for unskilled labour at a new aerodrome in the neighbourhood. Agricultural Labour and Military Service.   As the result of a conference held at the Ministry of National&apos;Service, it has been decided to set up a special tribunal to deal with the exemption of veterinary surgeons.     Cir John iviacFadyean, President of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, will act as Chairman. harvest Labour,    Instructions have new been Issued as to the distribution of the 10&apos;jOOO soldiers released by the Army Council to assist farmers with the in-gathering of the harvest.    One     ^ month&apos;s furlough will be given to such men in the first instanoe, but this may be increased to six weeks at the discretion of the Cemmandants of the Agricultural Distribution Centres.   A number of these men are being moved to distribution Centres immediately, the remainder to be requisitioned by the Agricultural Executive Committees as required.The number of soldiers released^from Command Depots on one month1s agricultural furlough for harvest work is now 1,600, including an additional 500 men sent out during the week.Arrangements have been made up to the present for the employment of 400 migratory gangs of German prisoners on harvest work, the number of prisoners comprised in these gange being 4,000The military authorities have decided that members of the Volunteer Force who are whole-time employed in agriculture may be-uexcused half tne usual number of drills during the months of August and September.Flax harvest.   The Department have arranged to loan to the Flax Production Department 800 soldiers for flax pulling, on condition that they are to be returned if ard^hen required for the corn harvest.    These men Are to be employed&apos;in the Selbyiarea of Yorkshire, where the flax is ready for harvesting but insufficient labour available.
At the request of the Flax Production Department, steps have boon taken to obtain labour priority for those contractors vn aro engaged in building factories in which the flax crop will be dealt with after harvesting.Soldier Labour.   The number of soldiers now out on farms, in addii; to the men especially released for harvest work, is 60,449.   Four weeks ago the total number was 59,329.,War Agricultural Vo.lunteers-* County Agricultural Executive Commit j have been authorised to&quot; engage under the horse scheme any volunteei who -are considered to be suitable for training as ploughmen, the A.to be trained at the horse ploughing schools.   Out of a number of who applied-to the Employment Exchanges, in London for onrolment as ;:War Agricultural Volunteers., about 60 were found suitable and placl an farms during the past week.The number,-of volunteers placed to date throughout the country.is 2,040. \Threshing Engine Drivers.   Owing to the, shortage of drivers availa to work the.;existing threshing machines,; the Department have made special/enquiries, with a view tQ securing the services of addition! men for this purpose.1 Arrangements have been made by which 150 drii will-be transferred from the Army Forago Department for threshing work. Enquiries have been made among the German prisoners employed from the various agricultural prisoner camps, and particulars have been received of a number of prisoners who state they are skilled traction engine drivers. Steps are being taken through the County Agricultural Executive Committees to get these men employed with threshing machines.   Application is also being made to the National Labour Priority Committee in order to obtain labour priority for the existing vacancies for engine drivers, but in view of the shortage i skilled men of this type now^remaining in civil life, it is unlikel] that more than a very small number can be obtained through the ordinary channels.
In those circumstances the whole matter has been placed before the Ministry of National Service, in order to obtain the services for six months of a number of threshing engine drivers who are now on military service.     Unless a number of these men can be released, the Department are of the opinion that serious difficulties will arise in connection with threshing during the coming season.Prisonens of War.   17 additional prisoner camps were openedduring the past week, making the total number of prisoners nowemployed on agricultural or drainage work as followsProm 298 agricultural camps............   17.387Employed from other camps..............     1,008Combatant prisoners lodged on farms....        66019,055Released aliens employed in agriculture    2,242Four weeks ago the total number was 18,735.39 additional schemes are now under consideration by the War Office.     These provide for the employment of a further 2,888 prisoners in agriculture.Women&apos;s Branch.Employment. Seven welfare officers have now been appointed, those in Lincoln and Cumberland for special work in connection with the camps which are being set up in those counties.     It is hoped that the appointment of these officers will make the organisation of camps, where; these are necessary, an easier task.     An interesting scheme is in progress at Market Bosworth, where a hostel has been started for several Land Army women working in the neighbourhood; and has met with great success. .  .A visit was paid during the week to a district in South Carnarvonshire where a number of small holdings are being run by women.&quot;    In many instances these women are the wives or widows of quarrymen, it having been the usual custom for the man to seek employment outside the farm.     The farms seen in most
in&amp;t-ahoes averaged ten to twelve, acres, two or three milking oil ere kept and a.small amount of. ploughing,.has.been,done.     The outstanding-feature-on every farm was the extraordinary interei and intelligence- shown by the women in their work, and their evident desire to obtain more knowledge.     Their,two needs at&apos; moment-&apos;^appear &quot;torbe (1) help i&amp; ploushingv,the, increased acreagi whic^leach is required to do, and (2.): a-.more profitable market for their milk.     iuany of the farms are In a hilly region and very remote. .* s ;It; has. been decided to try one of the Syracuse ploughs.pn the-s-Qfarmscv.; The Dis.triet/jRopresentative has undertaken to help, in the. formation of. a IT omen&apos;s Institute in t district,&quot;and thus bring to the women the help and information they require for increasing food production.

Unsatisfactory weather conditions and shortage of coal somewhat hindered the work during the week.Arrangements for^1918 harvest.   14 binders, 7 combined mowers aj reapers and 27 threshing machines were consigned during the wee ended 10th August making the total consigned to date 4,020 bindl 207 combined mowers arid reapers and 274 threshing machines., Demonstrations on the working of self binders are belt given where necessary throughout the country. Supply^ of Cpal for Agricultural Purposes. An arrangement has h made with the Coal Mines Department by which the full requAremer of coal for direct use in agriculture will be met, including ste ploughing, threshing, drainage, blacksmiths and other miscellanej purposes. Market gardens and nurseries will receive 80$ of thei normal consumption. The ordinary trade channels will, as far as possible, not be interfered with, but any person not obtaining fcfull requirements will be supplied from some other source on the-recommendation of the local Agricultural Executive Committee, wh will act directly with the District Superintendents of the Coal I Department.The Coal Mines Department have agreed in principle to supply of tho full requirements of firms engaged on the manufact ef articles used in agriculture, such as lime, fertilisers, insecticides, etc,   Coal supplies for makers of agricultural implements will be dealt with by the Ministry of Munitions.SUPPLIES DIVISION. Fertilisers - A revised estimate of the production of sulphate of ammonia suggests that the output during the next three months is likely to be somewhat larger than was anticipated.   It will not enable the applications which have been received to be met in ful but there is every prospect that tho Approved Agents will receive the bulk of their requirements.
4ajai el lcUdibe.ieii.iei asA circular is being issued emphasistrg the Importance of ordecriag isiji^i^bosphate without delay but at the present time a large quantity is being absorbed by compound fertiliser makers and there la no great surplus left for meeting the requirements: of dealer-    The makers of basic slag are now being informed that owing to the large excess applications which have been- received by the Department, It is not proposed to renew the general licence under which sales of 25 tons may-bo made to individual buyers.     makers have agreed with this proposal and genorally they appear to be doing their utmost to make the licensing system a success.     They are being advised in particular to make their deliveries to&quot;buyers in equal monthly quantities as this has the effect of sharing the supply equitably amongst all parties,Raffia Grass - Great difficulty has been experienced in obtaining a supply of this material for budding fruit trees, but the War Office has been induced to release one ton which will enable the1 urgent requirements of many fruit growers to be met.nTesting of Seeds Order     Since the issue of the revised Testing ofwillSeeds Order some 450 wholesale and retail seed firms in England andialWales have been visited^     In the majority of cases arrangements had already been made by these firms to comply with the new requiretoments, and generally speaking seedsmen did mt anticipate any greatactldifficulty in this connection.     Most of the retail seedsmen are merely repeating the declaration as to the percentage of germination and purity etc which they receive from tho wholesale firms from whom they purchase their seeds.A new feature in the circulars issued by some of the grass ,e eland clover merchants is the offer of quantities of seeds for feeding 5 is! purposes.     If it were not for the Testing of Seeds Order much of thit lot Iseed would undoubtedly still be offered as of &quot;seed&quot; quality,* fu!Seed Wheat.- During the last fortnight a large number of inspectionsI3eivpave been carried out. in the Southern, Western, Midland and North /Eastern Counties with a view to selecting the best growths of /heat for stick seed purposes.
fart, Disease - During the week arrangements have been made for til redistribution of the outdoor staff connected with the - administra tion of the Wart Disease Orders with a view to carrying&apos; out a careful survey of the different districts in which the presence of wart disease is suspected.Potato Spraying - Where potato blight was not previously reported) it has appeared in practically all of tho Southern and Western counties during the past week, including Pembrokeshire, Denbighsh Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Kent, Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, Suffolk and the London area.   The disease is now, therefore,twidespread but reports indicate that the attacks are slight.I am,Sir, .&apos;     . -  : Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt. Hon.
