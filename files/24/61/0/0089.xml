This Document is thesrnment.24th August ^1918.SECRETRIO-ID AIRSHIP SHEDKILLEACtHAdmiralty Memorandum for the %r Cabinet.On 14th November, 1917, the Far Cabinet, (217,   &amp;J.p Minute 15) confirmed certain Recommendations of tWWar&apos;1 Priorities Committee for an increase from 5 to 16 in the class of Rigid Airships, and for the building of 3 Housing Sheds at Dorchester, Lough Neagh and Killeagh.    At a later stage, owing to representations by the Works Construction Sub-Committee, endorsed by the War Priorities Committee, as to the difficulty in supplying; steel for the Housing Sheds, the War -Cabinet on 1st February, 1918^ (??6, Minute 7 ) decided&apos;that &quot;no further supply of steel should be applied to the building of the three Housing Sheds in question for Rigid Airships&quot;.The Admiralty new desire that the matter should be reconsidered by the War Cabinet, to the effect of giving sanction for the construction or housing accommodation for 2 airships at KilleaghoThe main arguments in favour of the provision of Housing Sheds for Rigid Airships in Ireland were fully stated when the matter was last before the War Cabinet.    Their cogency has by no means diminished: on the contrary., as the enemy submarine effort tends to be exerted at greater distances westward from cur shores^ the necessity for providing; airships which can undertake long distance scouting and convoy work becomes mere apparent. &quot; Such work, however, can only be accomplished if provision is made for housing; airships in Ireland.The approval given by the War Cabinet to the Construction Programme for Rigid Airships, involving the maintenance of 16 Rigid Airships, has never been recalled. In their Programme or Construction, the Admiralty have accordingly provided for the ultimate establishment of a fleet of 16 Airships.    At present, there are 6 Rigid Airships in commission&apos; but as the Programme of Construction matures, this number will be increased, and, in the absence of operational wastage or further less, the numbers in commission&apos;will, by the end of April, 1919, be 9  after allowing for the deletion of all the &quot;23&quot; Class ships, which by that date Fill have become obsolete.     Until that date, the approved housing accommodation, which comprises 9 Housing Berths, will be adequate.    After that,  ate, housing accommodation becomes the limiting factor.In June 1919 a new ship will be completed, and in order to house it one ship cf cider type will, in the absence of operational wastage, have to be deleted.    In July, 1919 2 additional new ships will be completed, asfifcing 11 Ki^id Airships I      1 then in commission.    It is accordingly essential that the construction cf the Killeash berths should be carried to completion at the earliest&apos;possible date.    This would provide housing accommodation for a total cf 11 Rigid ships, and it is proposed to adjust the building programme to such extent asmay/
q (* Cmay be fame! necessary, in order tc imintain in commission 11 rigid airships, instead of 16 as previously approved. The Admiralty have contemplated this reduction in the airship programme with the greatest reluctance; hut they Trve in view the necessity for reconsidering the matter as time *ces on, and desire that they should net he held as committed     finally to the reduction in the number of airships from 16 tQ 11. It is however essential to the success of cur n*val effort that complete provision should be made at the earliest r-cssible date for&apos;the maintenance of 11 ships in commission, including prevision of the necessary housing accommodation.The proposal as regards Killeagh, which was under consideration in February last, was for the erection of one double berth    shed  750 feet long x 180 feet wide x 130 feet high. The present proposal, however, is tc erect two single sheds, each 850 feet long, 150 feet wide and 1*0 feet high.   In view cf the size cf the airships which are new being designed, and tc provide for probable future developments it is deemed necessarr to increase thews dimensions and it is considered impossible on account of the time available tc build a double shed tc carry two of the largest airships.  The minimum diameter of the largest airships new being designed is 85 feet and it is important tc have a considerable amount cf space additional tc the actual width cf the machine, and tc allow for working space.   In proposing to build two single sheds, instead cf cue double       berth shed, the Admiralty have also m mind that one of the twe sheds now propose^ can be completed at an earlier date than would be possible for the completion of a double berth shed.   The first cf the sheds at ICilieagh. could probably be completed in about twelve months time, if the*-rrcrk is put in hand at cnoe, and the second early in 1920 and the Admiralty therefore press upon the War flahinet tc give their immediate sanction for the wcrk tc be proceeded with&apos; forthwith.As the previous adverse decision cf the war Cabinet turned upon the difficulty cf providing the necessary steel, which was pressed upon them by&apos;the Ministry cf Hmiticns, special consideration has been given at the present time tc that aspect cf the question.   The quantity of steel involved in the construction cf the sheds for which sanction is new sought is estimated tc be 8,500 tons, including the two wind screens necessary, and, as the result.cf ccnsultati.cn with the &quot;tee,! Department of the Ministry cf Munitions,  it appears that no difficulty will be experienced in providing this quantity cf steCL out of Admiralty allocation. Apart&apos;from the question cf steel, the most sericus difficulty cf constructional wcrk is the provision of the necessary labourj  but, as the housing sheds in question are tc be erected in Ireland, it is not anticipated that in the present case this will create any sericus trouble.fSigned)  ERIC ffPDDSS.24 August 1918,
