Telephone No. iVictoria 8660./This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic fvlajesty&apos;s Government)6, Whitehall Gardens,London, S.W. 1.99^W f J til/ *2-Cabinet,I circulate a memorandum drawn up by Sir Stephenson Kent on the effect on wages and output in this Ministry of the recognition of the principle that wcnen should be paid at the sane rates as men.I am in substantial agreement with the memorandum4 especially in so far as it refers to the probable effect on output, set forth on page.3 paragraphs ( ) and (g)30,0.18.
CLAIM BY WOMM TRANSPORT WORMS FOR TFS SAME WAGES AO lO SAME M  COTSES Alii MEN. SIMILAR CLAIM BY WOMEN Bl&apos; MM IT ION UlDUDTRIES.itTo The Minister.1. In connection with the Memorandum submitted&quot;by the Minister of Labour as to the wages of women Transport Workers, I think that the War Cabinet should know that the claim made on behalf of those women has also been made by the women in munition Industries. The claim so far as the munition industries ae?e con-cerned involves consequences so serious that I must emphasise the necessity of exercising the greatest care in arriving at a decision on the case of the women Transport Workers so as not to prejudice the full con-si deration of the much wider problem of women on munitions work.      Whatever decision be arrived at with regard to women transport workers, the considera-tions hereafter set out indicate that the application to munition works of the principle of the same rates and the same war bonuses for women and men may have disastrous consequences.The Trade Unions representing women employed on munitions work applied to the Ministry of Munitions in April last for an order that women on men&apos;s work should be paid the same rates and the same war bonuses as men.    This claim was inconsistent with the existing orders of the Ministry, both in respect of rates (except in the case of skilled men&apos;s work) and war bonuses, and was refused.     It has since been submitted to the Ministry of Labour with a request for Arbitration, both by the Womens Trade Unionjon behalf of women on all men&apos;s work and by the Skilled Mens Unions in respect of women on skilled men&apos;s work.    The Minister of Labour is obtaining the opinion of the Law Officers on the question whether there is any right to Arbitration on a^ matter determined by Statutory Orders.The agitation for the present increase Is a men^ rather than a women1s agitation.   Its real object in my opinion is so to increase the cost of women&apos;s employment both now and after the war tjiat employers will neither engage nor retain them.Prom the women&apos;s point of view the agitation is trustified fa) because the wages they now enjoy are extremely high.   The average wages of women on munitions work are now not less than 300$ia excess of the wages earned by women of the same class prior io the war.Women enjoyed on skilled men&apos;s work  are, under the orders of the Ministry, paid the same wages as men, subject to a deduction if they do part only of the men&apos;s work, this being the condition on which the skilled Unions assented to dilution.    The mea&apos;s war bonuses given to meet the increased cost of living are now claimed in   addition for the women, on the plea that the payment to the women of the women*s war bonuses instead of the men&apos;s war bonuses is a breach of the spirit of the condition, in that it/enables
enables employers to get the men&apos;a work done more cheaply by women.   As, however, the expense of the war bonuses given to meet the cost of living are borne by the State and not by the Employer there is no justification for this plea.   The-claim of the skilled men would imply that the bonus formH part of the rate and is, therefore, contrary to the understanding that the men&apos;s rates are not to be raised during the war.   It is farther contrary to the terms of the agreement with the skilled men as to women&quot;s wages, and to the terms of the Committee on Production awards re-lating to me^s war bonuses.    If it were acceded to the result must be to extend to all women on munitions work the full war bonuses given to men.    The women on skilled menrs work receive higher wages thsn any other women;   they have consequently less claim on the merits than any other women to an increased war bonus, and if they receive the men&apos;s war bonuses on theoretical grounds the claims of other women for at least as good treatment would be irresistible; (b) because in general women employed on men&apos;s work are incapable of performing the same work as the men and it would only be the rare exception that would be justified in claiming equal pay on the ground of equal work.The consequences in munition ^Industries of accepting the principle that women on men&quot;s work must receive the same rates and the same war bonuses as men would he as follows i-(a) The application to all women on munitions work of the greater part of the increase involved in the concession of the above principle to women on raenTs work.   What is menrs work in one Establishment or district is often women&apos;s work in another Establishment or district, and it would therefore be impracticable to distinguish between the war bonuses paid to women employed on men1s work and women1e work respectively.    In addition to the payment of the same war bonuses, it would be necessary to maintain the present relation between the wages of women on men&apos;s work and women on women1s work and if the wages of the former were raised to the same figure as the menTs, a consequential rise would have to be made in the latter also.(b) The men already resent the high wages earned by women on certain classes of work.   This further increase would inevitably lead to a further demand by the men.Co) Approximately one million women are employed on Ministry of Munitions contracts.    The inoreases would vary, hut the average increase would amount on a rough estimate to 15/- per week at least,(d) This increase or the greater part of it, would inevitably extend to the large numbers of women employed on private work in Establishments only partly engaged on munitions work,   few, if any, of these Establishments could bear this charge unless the State were to adopt the principle of subsidising private industry.   As employers could not pay similar increases to women fen private work either the discrepancy would he a little short of a scandal or Employers with mixed contracts would have to throw up their munitions work.
(e). A similar inorease would spread to the many womenemployed on war work whioh is not Immediately within the soope of the Ministry of Munitions; for instance, tho Woollen, Leather and Cotton trades.(f) A grave loss in output of munitions duo to lost time and diminished effort &quot;by women who would he guaranteed earnings greatly in excess- of their actual needs.(g) A refusal by employers to retain or engage women on such terms which would in fact put a complete stopto dilution already seriously prejudiced by the wages now obtaining^ This must lead to a grave position as regards man power both for munitions and the Axmy.The general position of wages in the munitiSra industries is now gravely disturbed and needs immediate examination. Until that has bsen completed and remedies devised for the present oonfaeion a concession to the claims now made on behalf of women would euaeager any reasonable solution of the whole problem of wages on munitions work for the remainder of the war.2.      The difficulties as to wome^e wages on munitions work are set cut not because a decision on thea is required at the moment though such a decision cannct be long 6.elerred*   They are advanced to illustrate tho grave tremble that a concession to the women transport workers1 demands might involve.20.8.18,
