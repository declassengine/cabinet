*1j 4 ACAUCASUS POPPER COMPANY LB.MED.Pinner3 Hall,Auat in P rlaw, E. 0.2 24.7.1018.Sir,Copper supplies, for, the GermansI beg to report that I arrived in England on the 1st Instant, after traversing the country from Batown on the Black Sea to Murman in tho extreme north of Russia.At Daansoul, 40 riles from Batoum, near the Turkish frontier, I was engaged in producing copper ffrom the mines of the Caucasus Copper Company, the said copper being of the finest quality and used for tho manufacture of munitions by the Russian Government.V/ithin 25 miles of the Caucasus Copper Qors mines and on the Tchorook river, the copper mines of the Qartzkana Copper mines are situated,Early in January of the present year brigands - the advance guard of the Turkish array - appeared in the district.   In February the brigands assumed and to some extent held control of the district.At that time I sent word to the British Consul at Tiflis, requesting him to notify the British Military Mission - then in Tiflis - that the,valuable copper mines of the district were about to fall into the hands of the Turkis, who would hand them over to the Germans who badly needed the copper, a-nd I advised that parts of the machinery be destroyed at Daansoul, also that the Quart zkana Mines be set on fire to prevent the copper reaching Germany,   By destroying certain vital parts, which could be done in a few minutes, production could be stopped for a long time.On 6th March I arrived in Tiflis and shortly afterwards I met Col. Pike tho head of the British Mission, who requested me to give a plan shewing how the mines could be put out of order, and also a statement shewing what copper could be produced from the district.I furnished him with the required information.   About the middle of April the Turks captured Batoum and the mines, together with 12,000 poods (about 200 tons) of copper we had in stock.Our mines e,nd the mines of the Quartzkana Copper Company could in three or four months be made to produce 500 tons of copper per month and in 12 months under very energetic and good management an output of 1,000 tons of copper per month could be made, whioh could be increased still further - say to 50 tons of copper per day. As such a supply would be of priceless value to the Germans I have no reason to doubt that they are now taking full advantage of the opportunity.The mines having passed into the hands of the Turksl, the work of destruction could not now be effected in any other way than by aeroplanes.Should you decide to destroy the activity of the mines, I shall be glad to furnish you with any further information you nay require as to route, parts to be destroyed, etc,
itBeing an engineer of many years experience in raining. metallurgy and in railroads, I took special notes of the condition of the railroads and country through which I passed.My conclusions nay be summed up in a few lines, as followsRussia is divided up in sections, each section being for itself and for separation from the others. I saw no evidence of national spirit.In the Caucasus j the Arr^enians. who own most of the wealth of   . the country, were most active m politics and in labour troubles but they would not fight - not even to protect their women and children.   The Georgians who love to appear in the trappings cf war, are just as cowardly as the Armenians.The native tribes and the Tartars represent the fighting material, and they are in syxmpathy with the Turks, being of the sane religion.You may look upon the whole Caucasus as within the grasp of the Turks, whose aim is the same as that of the Germans&quot;- to drive the Bolsheviks from Baku and from the northern Caucasus back to Zarectsin on the Volga.Westward, the&quot;Germans with Ukraine troops have taken the Crimea and also Hostoff, near the Sea of Azov.&quot; Prom Rostoff they had advanced eastward along the railway towards the important&quot; junction of Tichosajeke.   They were within 35 versts of that point when I passed it on 12th May.   It was reported that the Ukraine troops were accompanied by two divisions of German guards, ana that the Germans were keeping in the background but dictating the policy and directing the Ukraine troops.   Fighting between the Bolsheviks and the Ukraine troops was proceeding as wo passed H.E. from Tiehorjeske.The Bolsheviks in this district struck me as being very smart, well set-up soldiers of the best quality and evidently regulars.5,    By driving the Bolsheviks back to Tzaretzin? on the Volga, the Germans would secure control of a vast territory, rich in food^products, especially in wheat.   Tzar est zin to Vladikavkas, in the Caucasus, I saw on every hand well cultivated lands, practically all in crop, mostly wheat, then not more than 6 inches nigh.   I saw few cattle but many horses.   The railroad from Vladikavkas to Sareotzin was controlled and operated by Bolsheviks soldiers.   Practically all the freight wagons were employed in moving vast hordes of fugitives who were moving in all directions, in search of better conditions,6.    If they should&apos;take Tzareetzin, the Germans would be able to seize the numerous fine steamers now plying on the Volga and -send troops southwards to the Caspian Sea, where the Northern Persians are hostile to us,   Tzarectzin is therefore a most important strategical point which could easily be held if we sent some troops^to support the Bolsheviks, who impressed me as first-class fighting material.Troops would have to be sent to Archangel from which, point they could travel both by rail and by river to Vologda, thence by rail to Jaroslav - about 1g0 miles from Vologda - thence by steamer to Tzareetzin - a 5 day journey, down the Volga.mihe Cossacks of the Don do not lire the Germans, but they are standing neutral, ready to protect their own interests but &apos; oaring little for Russia.I,    Our Government has, I know, refused to recognise the Bolshevikswho.....
9 1 Q  it)&apos;Who aro in favour of, and indeed aro puttie? in practice, tho confiscation, of property.   Tho Social Democrats and the other groups, except tho Cadets, who represent the official and educated classes, arc tarred with tho same brush,   Tho&quot;I     Cadets do not count and are not likely to succeed to power forI     a long time to come,10.   The railroads in Russia are practically paralysed and quiteunable to carry merchandise, being wholly engaged in moving tho hordes of fugitives.   I saw plenty of erqpty wagons, o specially along the Bolga, but the locomotives are very scarce being mostly out of repairs.   The workmen will not&quot;work, so repairs cannot be effected - when a locomotive breaks down there is an end to its usefulness.Tho speed of the trains on our trip averaged about 00 miles in ?A hours,   The road-bed and sleepers wore in fairly-good order, and with but little work would be lacle as good as ever,11.   -he Russian people will not fight either for us or for the Germans.12o   If they wanted to, they oould not because their railroad transport, is practically dead. In Potrograd and Moscow the bread allowance is one-fourth of a pound a day.   Before the war, the comon people used three pounds per day, Petrograd, Moscow and miry other points are starving&apos;., yet there is &quot;plenty of food in Siberia, but owing to the conditions of the railroads it cannot be reached,159   Death by famine threatens the Russian people,14,   The Gerrans are slowly but surely taking control of Southern Russia j what they are doing west of Petrograd did not come under my observations,15.   On the Volga water transportation was in excellent shape, the steamers being in fine condition, and sufficient in number to transport with expedition large bodies of troops and war material.    The Volga is too shallow for the submarine whioh would have no chance in such extremely shallow water.Oil fuel is used in the steamer? but fire-wood is growing in abundance on both banks of the river and could be used in case of need.    However, whoever commands the Volga can easily obtain command of the Baku oilfields.As you are aware, the Volga with its tributaries drains a vast territory including lies cow, tho heart of Russia,16.   The late German ambassador when taxed by the Russian Government with the Geriran encroachments in South Russia, as a breach of the Treaty of Peace, flatly denied that anyadvance was being made,17,   The Russian people regard the interference of the Germans with -jealousy, fear and dislike,18.   Tho operations in South Russia appear to have resuited from tho determination of the Ukraine Government to expel the Bolshevik soldiers who com j;ndod Rostoff and all the railway extending from there to Vladikavkas,   The Bolshevik   soldiers in question are free lances apparently, who have taken possession of that section of the country,    I doubt if they have any real political ties with the Bolsheviks of the Worth, The Germans took advantage of this quarrel to assist the Ukraine troops with a couple of divisions and in that way most of a laagnificont granary has fallen into their hands,10,   At the same time tlioy induced the Turks to advance on theCaucasus,,.....
Caucasus and to drive the Bolsheviks there back to the Volga.   Thus they are opening a road to the largest rtanpareao &apos; nines in the forM; to the great oilfield of Baku and to the copper nines of the Caucasus,0.   (The importance of blocking the Siberian railroads cannot be over-eatimated,1,   I have visited the country almost every year during the past 10 years and have met all classes of Russians.   I have gone through all of the revolution and have had my full share of labour troubles with tho worknern and other troubles with the Caucasian Government and- its officials.My experience with the Russians has not been pleasant. They are really generous and will make rainy promises, but they almost invariably fail to carry out their promises.   The word of a Russian cannot bo trusted.    This applies to tho working man as much as to the hignest official&quot;, as I know by a painful erporienco.!,   Since tho revolution there has been no government in Russia\ the country has been split up into so many atoms, each ruled by its working man1s committee and soldiers coimittee.   The high officials like Korsnaky and other heads have been mere puppets, who had to yield to the clamour of the working man. The&apos; worlcnen&apos;s Committee invaded and destroyed the army; it has by its greed end rapacity closed down almost every faotof-in tho country: it lias stolon from the rich; and from the any and navy it has stolen the very necessities of life, and y openly sold them to the people at exorbitant prices.   The Russian working man is still a serf at heart and by instinct, and his ambitious attempt to rule has resulted in the ruin of his country.    Ho democratic government will succeed in Russia - not in our time,    Russia requires the strong hand^ quick to punish and as quick to reward.,   To counter effectively tho German scheme of penetration with small forces, it appears to me, who make no pretence to military knowledge-, that something more than an advance from Vladivostock is required.   An advance from Vladivostok will take a long time.   &quot; It is said that there are more than a million Austrian and German prisoners of war in Siberia.,. On 1st June all railroad traffic between Russia  proper and-Siberia was stopped because, as a French officer stated,  0,000 Polish soldiers were forcing their way westward out of Siberia to join the Proneh army and they were being resisted by the Bolsheviks, who wanted to disarm them,   I presume \ that these are the soldiers who now hold the western terminals of the Siberian railroad, including Samarsa on the Volga,We mag&apos;&quot;, therefore, assume that the Austrian and. German prisoners have been bottled up since 1st June,   But there is more&quot;bottled up than the soldiers; Siberia may be described as the treasure-house of Russia, with its great copper, lead, zinc, gold, platinum, and coal mines.   It is also immensely rich, in food products.g*he question is could we not induce the Americans and Japanese to send a part of their troops to seize the line of&apos;the Volga and help maintain the blockade until the advance front Vladivo stock has been completed?The line, of course, would have to extend to Murmansk and Archangel and troops and war material would have to travel by those routes to reach the Volga,Tho move would have to be made without delay.   The lino of retreat, if need be, would perhaps be through Siberia. ^The Volga is a very wide shallow stream with very few bridges -an,ideal defonsive line.% In many places 1500 yards and more wide; very shallow, bed of stream filled up with dobris which is increasing,
From what I saw of the railroads, I have no hesitation in stating that the Germans cannot move large forces pap idly in that country, even if they could spare them, which is doubtful,    They would also havo a dangerously long line of communication, which might easily be dislocated by guerilla and aeroplane warfare,   Wo and the Americans and French already control the Hurmans.li railway.   The Archangel route, whioh is ice-bound in winter, might be kept open by ico-breakers.   It has the advantage of water and&quot; railraod transport, and gives the shortest line of corn&apos;iiunication.24.   The Russians, betrayed by their workmen, are in a helpless, hopeless, starving condition.    They would, I am sure, welcome intervention as it offers the only way of saving the country, but intervention, if made at all must be made with the strong, determined hand.The Kurraansk ami Archangel railroads, and the railroad from the Murman junction to Vologda, and from Vologda to Jaroslav must be seised and operated exclusively by the Allies. Otherwise, the striking workmen would destroy the efficiency of the railroads,   The boats on the Volga would have to be taken under military control, manned by Russian naval officers, and the important town of Tzarectzin should be seized at once. It contains immense stores of grain and a great wealth of locomotives and rolling stock,    There is also a great number of railroad wagons lying on the east side of the Volga.   Further south the groat oilfields of Baku should be seised.The Germans are, no doubt, seeking to withdraw prisoners of war by the Samara branch of the Siberian Railroad, From there they could rapidly carry them via Tzarectzin to Tuapse, or Novoressisk, in the Black Sea.    Later copper, lead and the other mineral wealth of Siberia could be conveyed over the sane route.25.   The Turkish troops who took possession of Trobizond wasdescribed to me as a mere rabble of hungry, ragged and footsore soldiers.    They treated the people of Trebizond with kindness and consideration, although the Armenians and Greeks had outraged and robbed their people, when they had to retreat before the Russian army at Trebizond,26.   A soldiers Committee went over to the Turks and invited than to take over Trebizond with the heavy guns and all the stores of munitions and food.   The Turks said they would enter Trebisond after the Russian troops left, which they did.    I &quot;think they were afraid to disclose their snail forces,27.   In addition to what had been grated under the Treaty of Peace, the Turks demanded the Port of Batoun,    To this the Caucasian Government would not consent.   The authorities in Batoum asked a very able Russian General to take command of the forces and protect the city.    He agreed to do so provided they gave him. supreme command, with no interference.    This the workmen&apos;s and revolutionary Committees refused to give.Strong forces, were organised, but when the small Turkish forces arrived they at once took the great forts which protect Batoum, accomplishing this feat with only four small mountain guns-, they then entered Batoum without a shot being fired.    The Georgians had sworn to defend the town to the lafct drop of their blood, and the Armenians were quite as blood-thirsty,28.   As a resu.lt of the fall of Batoum the Caucasian Governmentdeclared war on Turkey, and at once proceeded &apos; to mobilise its forces.    At this time Iihere wore 18,000 Russian officers,including.......
including one Ooisaondoj? of an army corps, in Eiflia, The officers offered to organise the m$ and drive off the snail Turkish forces, which they could havo done with consurP^o *aso.   But the workmen&apos;s coixiittee, afraid that they would lose control if once the officers got into the saddle, refused to accept the offer.   At this tine, and for some tine previous, the Tartars had taken possession of a portion of the railroad which connects Tiflis with Baku; tho Turks wore advancing on Erivan and Batoum was already theirs.   Therefore. Tiflis had to depend upon a single wagon road which wound its way over the main road to Vladikavkaz,   All its food supplies came over this narrow wagon road - all hor so transport.Tho Turks with excellent judgment made a threat! to out this road, whereupon the war-fever subsided in Tiflis and an arrangement was made with the Turks,I have described tho cases of Batoum and Tiflis at some length, because they show exactly what is occurring all over Russia and how it is that the worfcing-iaan government has sapped and destroyed the strength of tho country.   Whoever enters Russia ha3 that and no other kind of Russia to doal with, Appeals to patriotism, and to the best feelings of the people will bo.thrown away, &apos; Bribe them with sugar, tea.   and broad&quot;, but put every railroad and every means of transport under strict military law, otherwise the transport will fall to pieces and the troops be left in the air.   Stnking workmen will paralyse the effort as surely and as certainly as they have paralysed Russia.The official classes and all tho have money are not trusted by the people.The Governing classes in Russia have fallen from their high estate because they were lacking in backbone and were hopelessly corrupt.Pardon me for giving my views at such length.   My principal object is to admit your attention to the important supply of copper which the Germans are now, no doubt, obtaining from the Oauoasus, in which last February there was a stock of 1,300 tonS6I have shown that within 40 miles of Batoum the Germans can quickly obtain 500 tons of copper per month, which can be increased to 50 t^ons per day in a little over a year.   There weald be no difficulty in putting the nines out of communication by areoplane If an aeroplane could roach it.    As tho country is sparsely settled a continuous flight would not be necessary. The machinery is small and easily broken and the buildings are of timber which would take fire readily,    I can describe the route from Batoum and the buildings to be attacked,If we could make peace with Turkey and thus obtain comand of the Black Sea we could stop the copper supply and also the shipment of manganese ore, so necessary for steel loalcLng, I am satisfied that it would be greatly to our advantage to havo the Cauoasus owned by Turkey, especially if we could&apos; make friends w;Lth the Turks, who are by far tho best people in that quarter of the globe.   My impression is that wo have-listened too  iuch to the Armenians, who are the greatest of all liars, and not at all to the Turks, who are too proud to g complain about their wrongs,   I know that the Turkish people , have a great respect for the English and I believe that the mass of them would welcome a good understanding with this country.    Such an arrange: &quot;lent would havo a wonderful effect on the mountain tribes of the Caucasus, on the Tartars, on tho Persians, and on all Mohammedans,I am awa,re that such an opinion is not popular atthe t......
tho present tine, but there can be no doubt that such an arrangement made now would have a powerful influence in ending the war and it would restore our prestige with all followers of Mohammed.A vast amount of Eriti&amp;h Capital is invested in tho Caucasus.   If the Caucasus is handed over to tho people of tho Caucasus, I shall regard that capital as practically lost, for the ^Georgians, Armenians, and Greeks are out for confiscation and plunder,   !The Mohammedans pay little attention to politics.    Thus there would be no protection for capital. On that account also I an in favour of handing the Caucasus over to the Turks,Military Aid from Russians.Tho Russian officers are in a terrible plight and would gladly serve under tho Allies.   They could&quot;not, of course, be used as officers commanding allied troops.   They might, however, bo formed into divisions, composed entirely of officers, commanded of course by their own superior officers.   At Kutais in the Caucasus a cavalry regiment was formed, composed solely of officers, a compa&amp;y of which I saw; they looked very smart and capable soldiers.The officers, having been to a great extent driven out of the army, are many of them starving and if they cannot serve us, which they would prefer to do, they may be forced by hunger to serve under the Gorman flag.   It would, I think, be possible to form an army of 50,000 or possibly 100,000* composed entirely of officers. Such a body, armed and equipped might well form the nucleus of the force which in time must liberate Russia from the doiuination of the ignorant workmen, who have brought the country to its present shameful conditionIn conclusion pexxoit me once more to point out the supreme importance of1) isolating Siberia from German influence 2) destroying the production of the copper mines near Batoum(3) seizing the line of the Volga and tho railroads referred to with the enormous number of empty wagons now stored on trucks on the east side of the Volga - there are sufficient cars to caryy the traffic on the railroads to be seized. 4) seizing the town of Tzareotzin on the Volga and 5) forming a small army composed entirely of Russian officers.No copper has been supplied from Siberia since 16th September 1917,&quot;, Stocks there must bo heavy and the mines of copper, lead and zinc can quickly be made to produce in great quantity.If we cannot seize Siberia steps ought to be taken now, while it is possible, to destroy all metallurgical plants producing copper and lead; all plants used m the production of gold platinum and all railroad bridges of size and importance,I repeat that it is hopeless to expect any resumption of hostilities by the Russians on tho Eastern front.   The Russian array is as dead as Julius Caesar.    Its officers have been driven out of it and for the most part are living in concealment.    The country has no central Government&apos;, neither has it any provincial Governments except in name, with the possible exception of the Itoaine. The y/orfcnen1 s CoiimLttee rule in each district, doiT&amp;nating the so-called provincialGovernments.......
