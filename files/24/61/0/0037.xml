SHIPBUILDER AFTER THE WARMMMDll SUBMITTED BY m SHIPPING CONTROLLER OTH TBS CQNODRRSNCB Oiiwp^FRESIDEH? OP THE BOARD OF TRaDlH, THS MINISTER OF HBCONSTHQO-:   TION AITD THE POSTM3TRH-GMBRAL -introduction of a Bill dealing with the control of shipbuilding during the period of reconstruction after the war.The general question has since come up for discussion on thereport of Sir  Alfred Booth1s Committee on Skipping and Shipbuilding after the war;   and from the views expressed by representative ship-owners and shipbuilders at conferences recently held at the Ministry of Shipping it is clear that the introduction of a Bill on the lines originally proposed would be regarded with&apos; very consideiable mis-giving by the Shipping and Shipbuilding community and certainly would not be treated as a non-controversial measure.consideration, and after discussion with the President of the Board of Trade, the Minister of Reconstruction and the Postmaster-General, it has been decided to recommend to the War Cabinet an alternative course which it is thought will achieve the purpose in viaw without raising awkward questions.The problem is essentially one for the immediate post-war period.    During that period (i.e. for a year after the termination of the war) under the New Ministries and Secretaries Act, the Ministry of Shipping will continue in existence.    As the Act is drafted, however, its powers, being largely derived from regulations under tho Defence of the Realm Act, will, for the most part, lapse , automatically on the termination of the war.    It clearly cannot have been intended to prolong the existence of the Ministry without powers, and the absence of the necessary provision in the HewIt will be remembered that the TIar Cabinet in November last (War Cabinet 273, Minute 16) authorised the preparation and earlyHALL ^In these circumstances the matter has received furtherMinistries
th August, 1918.Ministries and Secretaries Act may no doubt &quot;be attributed to a drafting omission.    Stops must, in any event, be taken before the end of the war to remedy the omission, and when this has been done the Ministry will be armed with all necessary powers to enable it to deal effectively with the Shipping and Shipbuilding problem during the period immediately following the termination of hostilities.Two alternative drafts are annexed, one providing for the oontinuance of such powers as may actually be vested in the Ministry on the termination of the war, and the other continuing the power to make regulations.    The latter would undoubtedly be convenient, but it may be thought that the former goes as far as can be justified having regard to the general view in favour of bringing war emergency powers to an end as rapidly as possible.The vIar Cabinet are asked to cancel the instructions in their minute of 14th November, 1917, to approve the proposal made in this memorandum and to decide between the alternative drafts submitted.    It is also suggested that it might be well on tactical grounds to submit the Bill with the necessary explanation to the recently appointed Select Committee before it is introduced.It should be added that the Food Controller desires that the Bill if approved should be so drawn as to include the Ministry of Pood, which under the  New Ministries and Secretaries Aci? is in. the same position as the Ministry of Shipping.
