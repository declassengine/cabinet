.3U.tm&amp;Y Off ^jOQUM gTOMOfl,MTMALAjiDij.    H.M. Cocanorcial Attache at the Hague has discussed With M, Snouok a resumption ox negotiations for a general Agreement &quot;between Holland and tho Allies.    M. iSnouok maintained that it would ho necessary to examine again many of the questions involved, as con-ditions in Holland have changed considerably since December last. Holland no longer possesses a largo surplus of Butch produce for export and the Germans will insist upon securing a considerable proportion of this surplus in return for the iron, machinery, salt, potash, dyes, etc. which Holland must obtain from Germany.    m. Snouok; said that Dutch I public opinion would not tolerate the export of Dutch produce to a &quot;foreign country except in return for commodities absolutely essential. I Sir W, Townley will Inform the Netherlands Government that H.M, Govern-ment will be pleased to resume negotiations.    He will ask the  other-lands Government to state precisely upon what basis they are prepared to negotiate.It was recently reported in the Dutch Press that the Germans in their recent negotiations with Holland asked for 5,000 horses throe years old, 4,4-00 horses one year old, 5,000 tons of butter, 8,000,000 eggs, 10,000 tons of cheese, 3,000 tons of poultry, 10,000 tons of isugar and 100,000 hides-    *Che German Legation at tho Hague have pub!-lishod a correction of this report to the effect that Germany would be Sell satisfied to obtain the commodities in tho above list, but that regard must be had to the amount of supplies available in the Dutch market.In spite of the disposition of the Dutch Government to resume negotiations wo must not expect too much from tho present Cabinet. Sir W, Townley is Informed that of late the Netherlands Government!jjiave consistently obstructed the H.O.T. in the fulfilment of their bligations towards the Allies and that they aro interfering very onsiderably with the general work of the Trust.    The inO.I\ aro nxious   ^ resume their responsibilities but will have no real
V 96opportunity until a now Government has boon formed.,    Tha Trust ore at pxt ^mt compelled to show to the $etherlands Government any letters which thay address to foreign Legations and they have been definitely instructed not to endeavour to enter into any new Agreements with foreign powers. IM, Posthum is mainly responsible for those attacks upon the prostigsSid usefulness of the Trust.NORWAY.   The Norwegian representatives who recently wont to Berlin to discuss the question of Gorman safe-conducts informed the (Joroan Author-ikies that the Norwegian vessels reserved for Norwegian trade amounted to some 230,000 tons, of which 93,000 tons were chartered to the iior-wogian State shipping Pepartaent,    They also stated that 165,000 tons of Norwegian shipping were engaged in the Norwegian coasting services ancl that there wore 23,000 tons which were for certain reasons not al-Jlowed to ttfa&amp;Q for the Associated Governments,    rfho (Jo roans raised no Ejection to the present, distribution of Norwegian shipping as between )rway and the Allies*     hoy merely asked that the Norwegians should alntain in their present services until the end of the war tho vessels otually chartered to the Norwegian State Department together with the ssscls engaged in the lorwogian coasting trade and the 23,000 tons pilch are not eligible for Allied services.    On receiving a -ruarantse xi this sense the $ormans are prepared to grant safe conducts to all orwegian vossols chartered to the Norwegian Government.     hoy will oven How those vessels to undortako intermediate voyages without forfeit-Xk% their right to,safe conducts when engaged in Iforwogion trade,11100*   ^ho United States War -iTade Board have agreed to oond 30,000 6ns of grain to Italoo and to Issue export licences on a liberal scale or certain important foodstuffs, including corn products, dried or con-siissd milk, tinned fish and pork,    &apos;l&apos;hoy will also send supplies of pricultural and mining machinery,   Mtai manufactures and other comma-   -ties will be exported to Msxico so far as United States requirements rait.    $he United States Government ask that the Mexican Government fll in return facilitate exports to the United States of Mexican pro-.0Q not required In itoico and prohibit the re-export from ilexieo of o commodities sent from tho United States.
\ SStlffll SSSSiSSK Mi S2SB*        &apos;lU3 no to d last week that grave ob Action had boon raised to the proposed Allied declaration to the Neutral Gov-ernmenta protesting against the issue of German Bafe-eonduets to lioutra; ,ships.    tf.ll. Government have decided that the proposed declaration would on tho whole be inopportune.    So long as the German safe-conducts in question do not operate directly to tho disadvantage of the Allies no useful object is likely to be served by a general declaration in for-mal terms.    Such a declaration might lead to a general immobilisation of neutral shipping and Involve Neutral shipowners in serious difficult! es with the Allied Governments. Government suggest that theAllies should for the present do no more than insist that the Keubral Governments concerned shall not accept German safe-conducts upon terms which will preclude them from fulfilling&apos; any agreements they may havemade with the Associated Governments or which are designed to control-neutral tonnage to the detriment of the Allies.The Swedish Government have already accepted conditions attached to the issue of German safe-conducts whioh may gravely embarrass Miera in carrying out their Agreement with the Associated Governmentsf.   They are prepared to guarantee the Qerisen Government that neither the goods them-selves nor the products of goods carried to Sweden by Swedish ships sailing under Gormen safe conducts will be reexported to countries at war with Germany.    The Swedish Government understand that this will not apply to commodities such as coal and oil used in Swedish factories whioh manufacture for the Allies, end they oiaia that they wlll* be able to fulfil their obligations towards the Allies under ihe new agreement from native sources of supply.    The representations of the Swedish Governments have strongly the.appearance of special pleading.    Sir B. Howard will make it clear that the Associated governments expect Sweden to maintain her exports to the Allies of commodities manufactured as hitherto with the aid of imported rateriels and chat the A sedated Governments do not recognise the legitimacy of tho German submarine blockade.     The Germans are demanding a si liar form of guarantee from aorway, hut in this case the guarantee was expressly moditied during
Lei ..Asetteaions at Berlin in order to allow the Norwegians to send toi&amp;ls. Such materials, however, must not aofcually form part of the fflmodities exported.    Be in e sen tat ions on the saao lines as the re-e ease of Morway,    The Allies will insist on their iigreemoat $feeing served, leaving It to the Norwegian and Swedish Ctovernmsnts to uphold Interpretation of the German guarantees required from them consist-K.M. Govemeeat suggest that the Allied representatives in neutral intriea generally should take an&apos; early opportunity of drawing the at-it ion of the Sows raiments to which vhey are accredited to the diffieul-m which inciy arise from the acceptance of Gorman safe conducts hy neu-tX Teasels.     here might he a s poo if is allusion to the aiilionltiaa. j(oh. hove arisen in llerway and.

It would be pointed out that -mm safe conducts are not in any way analogous to lostars of assur-- e or escort licences,    $he $anaansafe conduct is based on an illegal , eat to destroy neutral shipping, whereas letters of assurance are  ,sly a eonvenicnee to neutral traders assuring them against delay in ..  exercise of the universally recognised right of visit and search,  he following is a guia&amp;ary of the losses to merchant shipping, I to one say activity, whtohiiSwre reported in the period mg, 9-15 inelit . k.
