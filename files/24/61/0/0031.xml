w. cConfidential.Political Intelligence Department,15th August, 1918.Foreign Office, S.W.I.AUSTRIA/008.MEMORANDUMonParliament and Government in Austria.(March - July 1918.)The following memorandum deals entirely with the internal political and Parliamentary situation in Austria during the spring and early summer of this year.     It is circulated as it may he found convenient to have a short narrative of these very complicated events on record for reference.    The Monthly Report for July, reviewing the essential elements in the present position of Austria, described her Parliamentary dis-oussions and governmental crises as totally irrelevant.     Never-theless it may be found useful to analyse these developments if merely in order to test the accuracy of that view by different means.     The conclusion arrived at in these two memoranda is that it is impossible for the Austrian government to develop and carry out any consistent policy within Austria&apos;s present geographical and constitutional framework.    The different governmental crises are in themselves of no fundamental importance because they are merely the symptoms of the one permanent, incurable crisis which has its root in the nature of the Austrian State and which now saps its government orranisation.
The Austrian Parliament, ad j curried on March 15th and was to have met again on April 30th, but the government.&apos;.found itself unable to allow its reassembling until July 16th.     The intervening period was marked by the outbreak of three distinct crises - the German crisis in April, the Czech crisis in May and the Polish crisis in June.(a) On April 2nd Count Czernin Slivered the speech which involved him in the controversy with M. Clemenceau and led to the publication of the Emperor Charles&apos;s letter to Prince Sixte of Bourbon, and finally to the retirement of Count Czernin on April 16th.     The disclosures produced intense unrest among the German nationalists, and the Court and government were threatened by embarrassing debates had Parliament reassembled without their having previously reconciled the Germans.     On April 28th with the consent of all the Parliamentary parties the President of the Lower Chamber put off its reassembling to May 7th.(b) On May 3rd Dr. von Seidler, whose tactics had hitherto been conciliatory towards the Czechs and Jugo-Slavs, attacked them in a speech at a conference of Parliamentary leaders.     He fore-shadowed the partitioning of Bohemia into German and Czech districts and a regime of repression in the Jugo-Slav provinces of Austria. The division of provinces into nationally more or less homogeneous districts is in itself a defensible measure provided it is donein a constitutional manner and without discrimination between nationalities.     But Seidler proposed to carry It out by putting an artificial construction on an obsolete law of 1868, and whilst enacting it in Bohemia, where the Germans are in a minority, refused to do the same in Styria and in Carinthia, where the majorities are German^ and the minorities Jugo-Slav.    Nothing was said about the Ukrainians in Galicia.     The partitioning of Bohemia was the price which the government paid to the German Nationalists for not asking questions about the Emperor1s letter
and not attacking the House of Parma,&apos;as they had planned.     The Czech and Jugo-Slav opposition, a chronic disease of Austria, was now certain to assume an acute form.     It was only to be expected &quot;that they would do everything in their power to upset the government, to impeach it etc..     The government had there-fore to make sure of a reliable &quot;defensive majority&quot; (&quot;Abwehr-majoritaV).     On May 4th Parliament was prorogued by Imperial order without a date being fixed for its reassembly.    It was, however, stated that this would be done before the financial votes expired (July 1st),and June 18th was therefore spoken of as the most likely date of its reassembly.     On May 6th M, Zolger, an official of JugO-Slav nationality who since August 191? had sat in Seidler1s Cabinet, resigned office, and on May 19th- an order was published dividing Bohemia into twelve districts, four German, seven Czech and one mixed.    The first two of them were actually to start work on January 1st, 1919.Negotiations were now opened with the P0les for the formation of a stable majority.     The Poles, who as a rule have shown no regard for Czech or Jugo-Slav interests demurred at the order for the division of Bohemia because they were afraid that the same might be done for the benefit of the Ukrainians in Galicia, where the Poles on the highest, their own. estimate form but 45 per cent of the population but have complete control of the government.    They wished to be reassured on that point-and proposed the formation of &quot;a government of trustees&quot;, whereby the different nationalities were to receive a guarantee against their status possidendi being altered during the war.    The German Nationalists naturally rejected that proposal, oon-sidering the war the best season for establishing their dominion over the Czechs and Jugoslavs, but entered into negotiations with the Poles for a general political alliance which besides internal Austrian affairs would have covered matters of foreign policy (the future of Poland and the alliance with Germany).
(o)     In the be Ginning-: of June, whilst these negotiations were still proceeding, the Poles made a startling, discovery. They found that a promise had been given to the Ukrainians to separate the Ukrainian part of Galicia from the Polish part, and to form itt together with the Ukrainian districts of the Bukovina, into an autonomous Ukrainian province.     The exact nature and date of that agreement are not known even now.     At first It was believed that it was part of the peace Treaty with the Ukraine, and that the promise had been made by the Austro-Huhgarian Foreign Minister.     But even so, this could hardly have been done without the concurrence of the Austrian Premier as it concerned internal Austrian a.-.fairs.     Subsequently another report went round alleging that the promise had not been given ar Breat-Litovsk on February 9th, hut a week later, at Vienna, When the Ukrainians were asked to agree to a revision of the Cholm frontier in accordance with nationality.     Whatever the truth may be, Ssd.Ci.er was hardly less responsible than Czerhin for the part of the Ukrainian Treaty which concerned East-Galicia, Consequently, on June 10th the Parliamentary Committee of the Polish Club passed a resolution, confirmed by the plenary meeting of tile Club on June 21st, to oppose Seidler by the sharpest possible means.     Whilst reaffirming their belief that a strong Austria is to their interest and declaring themselves prepared to vote credits to any other government, they absolutely refused to vote them as long as Seidler remained in power.     But although all attempts at mediation failed, the German nationality insisted on Seidler remaining in office - they would not admit the fall of the Premier who had been the first to grant them the much-coveted division of Bohemia and the first to proclaim publicly the &quot;German course11 in Austrian internal politics.Whilst the Parliamentary tangle was thus getting steadily worse, July 1st, the day on which the financial vote expired,
mwas drawing, near.     On June-23rd;Seidler handed in the resignation of the entire Cabinet to the Emperor.     It was refused, but con-Wtrary to-threats that should a settlement prove impossible, not Seidler, but Parliament, would have to disappear, the reassembly oi* Parliament was fixed for July 16th.     In view of the critical internal position of Austria, the Court and directing circles did not dare to revert to the unconstitutional system of Count Sturgkh.Parliament met without Seidler havin   been able to assure himself of a.majority.     His opening statement was a violent German harangue describing the Germans as the backbone of the Austrian State and declaring that no government In Austria can rule against them or without them.    Yet all the enthusiasm which that speech evoked among the German bourgeois members could not add to the number of their votes.     Seidler was threatened by a Czech motion to impeach him for the unconstitutional order concerning Bohemia, and by a Polish notion which amounted to a refusal of credits even before the proper stage had been readied in the discussion of the Budget1&quot;.     He was certain of 220 votes (173 German bourgeois. 28 Ukrainians and a few minor groups) in a House of 466 members (50 seats are vacant and no bye-elections have been held during the war in Austria to avoid a triumphant re-election of the condemned Czech and Jugo-Slav members).     As the opposition of the 60 members of the Polish Club was directed against the person of Seidler alone, and was to ceease with his withdrawal, on July 20th he renewed his resignation, and this time it was accepted by the Emperor.     On July 25th Seidler was appointed Chief of the Emperor1s Private Cabinet.     The &quot;Arbeiter-Zeitung&quot; says in the political obituary which it devotes to him. that he had been ;:a sheer waste of timei,:.On July 24th Baron von Hussarek was appointed Prime iiinister. He took over the personnel of Seidler!s Cabinet except for its
two Polish, members,, to--whom.the&quot;Po.les objected for having retained! office under Seidler; they were replaced by two other officials of Peliah nationality.    Further changes are fore-shadowed for the autumn when the Cabinet is to receive &quot;a Parliamentary infusion&quot;\ it now contains one single member of the Upper Chamber and none of the Lower.Born in 1865) Hussarek entered the Civil Service in 1888;, was from 1893 to 1897 lecturer on Canon Law at the University of Vienna, and in 1897 returned to the ministry of Education where he became Count Sturgkh.1s main assistant.     In 1911, when Count Storgkh became Premier, Hussarek entered his Cabinet as Minister of Education.     He retained the post in the Cabinets of Dr. von Koerber (October - December 1917) and Count Clam Martinic (December 1917 - June 1918), but had to withdraw when, on the fall of Clam Martinio, the principle was laid clown that no one should hold office who had had a share in the unconstitutional regime of Sturgkh.     He then resumed teaching Canon Law.     Little is Imown about Hussarek&apos;s personal views except that, being a bureaucrat, he will behave with, the modesty which becomes an Austrian Premier and will take his orders from the Emperor, his confessor, his mistress, from Archdukes, Court officials, generals or from his Hungarian colleague - in short, from Austria&apos;s true rulers.     In his own leanings Baron von Hussarek is an ultra-Clerical,  snd this seems to have been the main reason for his selection.Hussarek1s first preoccupation naturally was to settle with the Poles.     The Magyar cligue - Burian^ Tisza and Wekerle -share the antl-Ukrainian interest of the Poles and are opposed to any concessions to the Ukrainians but this time had been un-able directly to interfere in what after all is an altogether internal Austrian problem.     Now that the Austrian Premier reversed the policy with regard to East^G-alicia, another Magyar,
m      f     mmthe notorious Count Forgach, was instructed to declare at Kievthat, the Ukraine having failed to fulfil her engagements con-cerning food supplies, Austria&apos;s promises also had ceased to hebinding - this refers to the setting up of an autonomous Ukrainianprovince but possibly also to Cholm, of which even the Ukrainianpart Is now likely to go to Poland.     Sixty Polish votes werethus gained in the Austrian Parliament which, in spite of thecorresponding loss of 28 Ukrainian votes, would have raised1-Iussarek&apos;s following to 252 in a House of 466.But a new complication arose.     The Clerical Germane wel-comed Hussarek.    The moderate nationalists accepted him providedhe maintained the &quot;German course;: in internal, as well as inforeign politics.     The extreme Nationalists declared against him.What they wanted was &quot;a strong man&quot; whom they could trust to rulewithout Parliament and carry out a coup cVetat in their favour.Baron von Handel, who under Sturgkh had prepared a scheme forbeenGermanising Austria, seems to have/their candidate.The old government bloc was crumbling] the opposition, except for the Polish Club, remained firm.     The German Socialists clis-liko Hucoapek, a clerical and an associate of Sturgkh, even more then they disliked Seidler; the Czechs and Ju^o-Slavs consider no &quot;conciliation&quot; from any Austrian government worth having. On the final reckoning it was found that the 60 Polish votes were outweighed by the loss of 28 Ukrainian, 30 Pan-German-, and of a few other votes.Here begins the most amusing, because the most character-isticaliy Austrian, stage of the crisis.     The Polish Club, trying to save Hussarek, approached the Czechs with the proposal that to save that deserving moderate men, they should for every German voting against the government, tell off one of their own men to leave the room.     The Czechs refused and the moderate Hussarek had to find another way out of his difficulties.     At the last
Qmoment before the vote on the Budget was taken, he is reported tp have struck a &quot;bargain with the Pan-Germans.     Seicller had promised them to set up two national districts in Bohemia on January 1st, 1919, and had not fixed any date for the remaining ten.    Hussarek now promised them the first two for September 1st, 1918, and the rest for January 1st, 1919, adding to it a few other administrative bribes of a similar character.     There-upon the Pan-Germans gave their votes to Eussarek, and the Budget passed by a majority of twenty votes.     The Lower Chamber adjourned immediately for the summer recess vdthout the Czechs being able in any way to take their revenge on Hussarek for thus having outdone Seidler.    The Upper Chamber sat for a few days longer. Answering a question, Hussarek denied the correctness of the report concerning his bargain with the Pan-Germans, but yet hinted that hewDuld after all do something of the kind as had been fore-shadowed in the report\ and at the last sitting of the Upper Chamber he delivered a German harangue to match that oil Seidler. He merely changed the metaphor - the Germans were no longer &quot;the backbone of Austria11, but ;&apos;the main source of her power11.One could hardly imagine anything more ludicrous than the part which the Austrian government has played throughout the crises of the last five months and the tricks by which it had to extricate itself from its difficulties.     It would perhaps be premature to consider now what its position will be when Parliament reassembles - they themselves, do not seem to have done so.     They have obtained financial votes for half a year ahead and will hardly hasten to reassemble Parliament sooner then necessary.     Before then many things may happen.     But these are the two outstanding facts of the present Parliamentary situation in Austria: that the only two big groups on whosesupport the government can count at all,, the German bourgeoisX   tfparties and the Polish Parliamentary Club, hold barely-half the
A J 7seats in Parliament j and further, that in the course of the last five month/; both these groups have had bitter conflicts with jjj)j;gyhe powers that rule Austria.    By petty tricks and bargains it has been possible to patch up the crises in Parliament, not to remove the ill-feeling -cfoich they had caused among the public. Yet even among those members of Parliament who finished by voting for the government a majority remains alienated from the Court and the ruling circles in Vienna, and distrustful of tlxam.15.8.18.
