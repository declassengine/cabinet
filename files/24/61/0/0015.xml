Draft of a Bill to extend the Power of taking possession cf Premises under the Defence cf the Realm Acts.Memorandum by the Food Controller.I have considered the draft bill to extend the power of jtaking possession of premises, under the Defence cf the Realm Acts . (G.T.5293) and wish to offer the following observations.I contemplate the necessity of taking compulsory possession I of land for the erection of cold stores and am advised that there Is dcubt whether apart frcm Clause 1(a) of the proposed bill the necessary powers exist.   If, however, the proviso to Clause 1 is left standing the Government will have no power to acquire owner-ship of the land so taken, and will thus have no means of compelling the owner t^ pay compensation for improvements, the benefit of the expenditure on which will thus be a free gift to him.I therefore suggest that the proviso to Clause 1 of the draft bill should be omitted,.J. R, CLYNES.Ministry of Food. 14th August, 1918.
