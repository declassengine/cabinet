3 DOOl3UMBNT ISTHE PROPERTY O:228HI3 :V&apos;HnA-rTig lUJESTY^S liQVIiiniiniMTW---5471.CHIT.WARCABINET.PENSIONS OF OFFICERS &apos; WIDOWS.Note by Mr.Chamberlain.It has been brought to my notice that whilst the pensions )f widows of Warrant Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers and men who fell in former wars have been raised by the Royal Warrant of April 17th, 1918, to the rates establlshed &quot;for&quot;the present war, there has been no similar revision of the rates for Officers&apos; widows.This seems to me illogical and unfair.     The pensions to officers&apos; widows are not given, I under-stand, as of right; but only where the recipients are shown to be in necessitous circumstances.     If this be so, these pensions must obviously bo inadequate for the support of these ladies (most of them aged or at least advanced in life) under&apos; present war conditions, and their circumstances which before were necessitous will now be in many cases1 those of extreme hardship.I think the same treatment should be accorded to the widows of officers as to those of other ranks, and that pensions granted to widows of officers for their husbands&apos; services before 1914 should be raised to the current rates.(initialled).
