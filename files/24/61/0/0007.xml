2312th August, 1918.FORTNIGHTLY REPORT onPACIFISM and REVOLUTIONARY ORGANISATIONSinTHE UNITED KINGDOMThe following report covers the period of the last four we eke.The principal event during that period has been the strike at Coventry and Birmingham.   It was entirely unaccompanied by any tinge of pacifism, though the pacifists were very busy distributing their leaflets among the strikers.   It was very difficult to deal with, because the leaders made no speeches in public, and the whole of the organisation was conducted undergroun&quot;. There is little doubt that the same situation will recur, perhaps in an aggravated form, before many months are over, but the experiences of the recen&apos; strike point very clearly to the faot that the aotion of the Government in threatening to put the strikers into the Army is a far more efficacious way of dealing with the situation than any proseoution of the leaders would be. As soon as the Government had made its intentions known, a stranger appeared in Coventry, and in conversation with some of the strikers in a saloon bar, adopted the one certain method of spreading newBs and told them in the &apos; strictest confidence that he &quot;had oome from the Ministry of National Service to arrange for the issue of the calling-up notices,     The news flew all over the town in a very few hours.   He went on to Birmingham, and there strikers approached him asking advice as to how they could avoid being called up.   He gave them, as the only method, to go straight back to work.   I may quote&apos;, as an illustration, the fact that at one works, where the daily average of   , . absentees on Monday morning is about thirty, only six men failed to turn up   -on the day -the strikers resumed work, and four of these sent telegrams ,to say that they had missed their trains and were coming on.A report, unconfirmed but said to be on good authority, reaches me from Copenhagen to the effect that Mr. Rosenblatt of the Deutsche Bank is making great efforts to buy English money, which he intends to UBe through Russians in London to create strikes in munition factories. .,All my correspondents in the Provinces agree in saying that there is very little talk of Peace by Negotiation.     Lord Lansdowne&apos;8 letter hasvbeen discussed, but on the whole, it is badly reoeived.   The pacifists&apos; iri;GIasgow welcome his attitude, but regard any aotion on the part of one so strongly  &apos; identitied with capitalism as suspect.   In Liverpool, working men.and women seem to have come to the conclusion that Lord Lansdowne has oome selfish-motive in desiring peace, probably a financial one.    Gn the other hand, the Independent Labour Party Petition to Lord Lansdowne is being freely circulated., and the letter is likely to be widely quoted by   pacifists during the next eleotion oampaign.A curious incident occurred in Glasgow on the evening of the 31st July, Some of the advanced pacifists started a story that the Prime Minister had gone to Berlin to negotiate peace.   A number of persons stood for some hours outside the Post Office expecting a telegram announcing that peaoe had been* i y/(This D(l- &quot;. ii&apos; I&quot;-( iJ.t ji&quot;... t ITIllMlHis 6nr.;No.19.
declared, and one of my informants Bays that there wore Boenes of great excitement in some parts of the town, many of the men on night-shift staying away from work.The Socialists in Glasgow arc carrying on a strong agitation for the return of the printing plant of &quot;The Socialist&quot;, which was raided on the 13th Juno, and for the release of John McLean,In the Northern area, despite the efforts of the Women&apos;s Peace Crusadei the working women are more determined upon a win-the-war policy than ever before,    Even those who were crying out for peace six months ago have entirely changed their minds, and this reacts upon the men, beoause unless they have a good reason for striking, they are liable to have a bad time at home.At the Textile Workers&apos; Conference at Blackpool, the pacifists tried to get in a resolution repudiating the secret treaties and calling upon the Government to renounce, the policy of the Mtnock-out blow&apos;, but the opposition was so strong, that the resolution had to he withdrawn,CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS.At Edinburgh, on the 17th July, a meeting organized to protest against the infliction of repeated sentences on conscientious objectors lod to a disorderly scene.    A large crowd assembled, and a olergyman who attempted to speak was hustled from the platform by soldiers and sailors.    The platform was smashed, and the literature destroyed.In Wakefield, popular feeling against the conscientious objectors continues, and in consequence, it has been considered unsafe to allow&apos;them their usual exercise.   This has given a text to the Independent Labour Party to the exclusion of their usual pacifist agitation.THE INDEPENDENT LABOUR PARTY.The Independent Labour Party have-been busy circulating a Peaoe Memorial to Lord Lansdowne, and canvassing for the next election.   They do not, however, appear to be drawing in much fresh blood.   One of their members, Walton Newbold, has been agitating in Sheffield and elsewhere against the intervention in Siberia.MISS SYLVIA PANKHURST.Miss Sylvia Pankhurst has been on a leoturing tour through Preston, Blackburn and Sheffield,   She thus describes her impressions.-   The miners -and engineers have lost faith in political leaders, and are in favour of direct industrial aotion,-whereas the textile workers still believe in . Parliamentary aotion, and are against strikes.   She is very muoh disappoint-ed at the falling off in the sales of the ^Dreadnought&quot;, and says that by the end of August, her supply of paper will be exhausted.MORALE IN FRANCE.The British Offensive was undertaken not at all too soon as far as the Frenoh oivilian morale was concerned. There seems to have been a growth of anxiety as to our inactivity:, since the British troops wore barely mentioned in the recent communiques.   It seems a pity that something could not be done
in this respect, but all this will vanish as soon as the results of the present Offensive have been digested.    The enthusiasm for the American.?, which is widespread, has to some extent replaced the gratitude felt for the work done by the British, but the Allies are all on such excellent terms, that this tendenoy may safely be   ignored.- The influence of French soldiers who have served side by side with the British is excellent, and in the Frenoh Army, there is great confidenoe in the future as regards .tho British front, especially in aviation.On the whole, &quot;French oivilian&apos;morale is satisfactory. .-The minor grievances are the difficulties of obtaining bread, and complaints cf the quality of the bread are rather frequent.   Reports have been appearing in local papers to the effect that America is sending over&apos;inferior flour. Paris has been praotioally without potatoes last week, and there are corn-plaints about food distribution.   There is apparently a general scarcity of potatoes, which is unfortunate, as a large number of people are using potatoes instead of bread.The calling-up of the 1920 class has produced a bad impression. People think that it indicates that the Frenoh losses in the recent c;--*!i counter-offensive have been heavy, and the socialists in particular are-strongly opposing the measure.   There are complaints that there is not an equal standard of military service in the different Allied countries; that the French are calling up men older than are required to serve in England, which, of course, is not the oaBe.   Longuet, in opposing the calling up of the 1920 Class, said that it meant that in six months time, the 1921 Class would also be called up.Labour troubles and pacifism have not been in evidence, and the strike on the Tramway and Metro Companies in Paris, recently settled, was merely a question of wages.    There is a little unrest on the railways for the same reason.The Malvy case does not seem to be very much discussed, though it is considered likely that the socialists will engineer a movement in favour of Malvy.The most important event of reoent weeks is the change of power in the&apos; National Socialist Council.   Jean Longuet of the old minority party has defeated the majority under Renaudel.   This will probably result in an attempt on the part of the Confederation General du Travail to force the Government to allow the International Conference to be held.   Longuet had his triumph on the fourth anniversary of the death of Jaures, and his appearance was dramatic.   He arrived on the platform while Thomas was speaking.   The crowd sprang up and greeted him with frantio cheers.   His spoeoh was an appeal for action and unity amongst socialists, and he declared that patriotism and internationalism were not antagonistic.   He praised the German socialists, and in reply to an interrupter who shouted &quot;Schoidemann&quot;, he said that they must not condemn the sheep beoaUBe one of the shepherds had proved a traitor.   Albert Thomas is said to be declining in influence, the story being that he became rich while he was a Minister.It is rumoured that Troelstra has recently  travelled via Germany
to Switzerland, where ho will try to organize a meeting of the International. BELGIAN MORALE.The morale of the Belgian Army in the front is naid to be good, but behind the lines there iq something to be desired.   The present Minister of War seems to have made himself very unpopular, and thero ia a good deal of sinister agitation among .the Flemings,   A number of Flemish pro-German leaflets, secretly printed in England on a Romeo machine, have boon eaus-ing muoh misohief, but within the last few days, a due to the origin of those has been followed up, and steps are being taken to,prevent their issue for the future, MORALE IN SWITZERLAND,   .Trustworthy travellers arriving in Paris from Switzerland state that there is a groat ohange in; sentiment, particularly among the German^Sv/iss in Bale and Zurich,   The advance of the Frenoh has caused a reversal of feeling in favour of the Allies,   Business houses are said to be showing their Allied sympathies, and it is freely said that, the recent coal arrangement with Great Britain has done moro to undermine pro-German propaganda than any other event since the beginning of the war. .
One of my informants had a long conversation with Litvinoff a few days ago.   Litvinoff had lately received a letter from Joe Fineberg, his former secretary, giving a rose-coloured account of life in Petrograd and Moscow, Litvinoff was insistent that the Bolsheviks wore enemies of Germany, though he admitted that Germany was now showing herself to be more favourably disposed to thorn.   He was very indignant about the Miiricari Expedition, and said, &quot;if they(the Allies) attack us in force, it .will drivo us into the arm3 of Germany......The question of peace is uppermost in our minds, and we have strong reasons for believing that the day when peace is deolarod strong working olass movements will take place in Germany, Austria and the Ukraine,   It is for this that the question of peace - early peaue - is the guiding spirit of all our policy.&quot;On the ovoning of the 7th August, at the Metropolitan Restaurant, Kingley Street, V/estmincter, a small meeting, organized by the Sylvia Pankhurst group, was addressed by Pressman, a Jew employed in the Foreign Office at Moscow. Admission was by ticket, and the audienoe did not exceed thirty.   Pressman made no sooret of the straits to which the Bolshevik Government is reduced.   He said they were still strong in the larger towns, but weak in the country, where the peasants are still so muoh imbued with respect of property that they are fruit-ful soil for counter-revolutionary propaganda.   Ho said that many of these peasants have still the crops of 1915, 1916 and 1917 Btored away.   &quot;We shall go down&quot;, he said, &quot;if the democracy of Europe does not come to our assistance; we are convinced of that&quot;.   He admitted that there was an entire lack of organisation, each local Soviet doing and undoing things without reference to the Central Power in Moscow.He said that preparations are being ,made for resisting the Intervention of the Allies, which is resented even by those socialists who opposed the Bolsheviki about the signing of peace with Germany.   In faot, the aotion of the Allies is likely to weld all the warring factions in Russia together.On the 27th July, a Bolshevik, said to be editor of &quot;Pravda&quot;, who came, it is said, in the capaoity of Litvinoff&apos;s courier, gave a leoturo to the Jewish Sooial Democratic Branch.   Litvinoff was present, but did not speak. The lecture contained the usual glorification of the Bolshevik cause, and oondemna-tion of the Allies and Kerensky.Kerensky has again arrived in London, and is staying near Regents Park. I have received a very detailed report from Frenoh sources on his proceedings in* Paris, where he made daily visits to the Russian Embassy to see Maklakoff, the Russian Ambassador.   Kerensky made several of his fluent speeches, which were interpreted first by Fabrikant and latterly by Roubanovitoh, but when it was found that Roubanavitoh was dootoring his translation, he was relieved by Severac.A number of people, including Gavronsky, the revolutionist who accompanied Kerensky to Paris, have done their best to extract from him what his real policy is, but without suocef.3.   On one point he is voluble    the neoessity of overthrowing the Bolsheviks by Allied intervention.   He talks of a secret pact between the Bolsheviks and the Germans for the crushing of the Czecho-Slovaks, and of their general pro-German polioy, but nothing will extract from him any indication of what his own policy will be if the Allied intervention is
successful.   Those who are closely associated with him believe that he would work just as well for a monarohy as ho would for a republic, and that he is sitting on the fence with his eyes upon American opinion.It is too early as yet to gather the views of leading Russians upon the aotion of the Bolsheviks in arresting Mr. Lookhart, and making a declaration of war against the Allies.   On the late afternoon of the 9th, Litvinoff and three of his olosest associates were, placed under Police observation, and it has been intimated to them that this is in consequence of Mr. Lookhart&apos;s arrest and that perhaps other measures are to follow.   He may communioate with his . Government and put pressure upon them,
