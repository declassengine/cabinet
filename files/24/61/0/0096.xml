lo The War Cabinet is already acquainted with the proposedallocation of aeroplanes to the Army, hut for convenience a table is attached shewing the extent to which the Ministry&apos;s proposals fall short of Array requirements3 namely, by 24 squadrons * i flighty to which must be added a squadron for the Caspian Sea, additional to the demands shewn in the tableo The bulk of the reduction (19 squadrons) proposed by the Ministry is at the expense of the British Armies in France, although a portion of the unallotted emergency reserve (22 squadrons) to be held by the Air Ministry may be available020 The reduction in the Army allotment would appear to befor the benefit of the Independent Air Force0    It has beeno96 CcAcSo   stated by the Ministry that suitable squadrons of Independent 15/8/18 oAir Forces   will be available on great emergency to support those portions of the Air Force co-operating with the Navy or Armyc    I do not, however, feel confident that tho Air Ministry will be in a position to carry out this intentionc The Military Representatives of the Supreme War Council in Joint Note No-o 35 have advised that the Independent Air Force should be directly under the Supreme Command^ and I am of I opinion that General Foch has the firm intention of insistingon controlling any portion of the IfJ&apos;AftFo located on French-soilo    The effect of the Air Ministry1s proposal to increase j the IoApFe will be to give General Foch control of anumber of squadrons at the expense of the British Army in I Franceo   The latter^ in consequence^ will not be able to rolyI on obtaining the use of any of those squadrons for offensiveoperations
ti) b 1operations on tho British Front, and we may well find our own Armies starved for tho benefit of our Allies *All recent experience has shewn tho value of direct co-operaticn by the R0AeF* in tho ground battle and that any policy which tends to weaken the forces available for this class of offensive action will militate against the offensive power of the Army as a whole and will undoubtedly add to the casualties both of our Infantry and Artilleryo      However Important the operations of the Independent Air Force may be, I must emphasise tho vital necessity: of subordinating them to the requirements of the Army when critical military operations are in progressb    I would, therefore, urge that the requirement of the British Armies In France should be met in full, and that when important operations are not in progress squadrons required by the I,Af,F0 should be loaned to it by the Army,, on the distinct understanding that they do not form part of the I0Ar.Fc and consequently remain at the entire disposal of the ArmyP and therefore of the Air Mnistry.)(sd) Henry Wilson0C yl o Go 8aGeneral StaffsWar Office, Soldo
