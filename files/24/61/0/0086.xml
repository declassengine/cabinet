frBlNgy/2-     His BrConjidential.LABOUR POSITION IN MUNITION INDUSTRIESS.(21st August 1918.)I circulate the following notes which have been prepared in the Intelligence and Statistics Section of the Ministry of Munitions on the labour position in munition industries.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.I.-STRIKES. Statistics for the Week ending the 14th August.During the week ending the 14th August, 13,426 working days-^th of 1 per cent, of the possible working time were lost through strikes on munition work (exclusive of work for the Admiralty).&apos;11&quot; At Sheffield, 1,700 moulders lost 6,800 days. This strike, which began on the 15th July and ended on the 12th August, caused a loss of 40,800 days.Sheffield Ironmoulders.A three weeks&apos; strike of the Sheffield iron moulders followed a somewhat curious course.The trouble arose owing to the fact that one large firm Messrs. Hadlields, Limited had a system of 48 hours per week as opposed to the usual Sheffield week of 53 hours. The men in the other establishments demanded that they should be paid an hourly rate equal to the hourly rate of the 48-hour men. After notices had been handed in, a decision adverse to the men&apos;s claims was given by the Committee on Production.   A deadlock was thus reached, and the strike began.Eventually it was agreed that, if the men would return to work, a meeting should be held at Sheffield with a view to the arrangement of terms of settlement. Work was resumed, and Sir Thomas Munro repaired to Sheffield to preside at the meeting, at which the case for the men was put by Mr. Arthur Henderson, and the case for the employers by Mr. Capron (of the Sheffield and District Engineering Trades Employers&apos; Association). Though the discussion was amicable, the views of the conflicting parties could not be reconciled, and, in the end, the Ministry announced a decision which made a small concession to the men, but left the major part of their claims unsatisfied. The efforts of Sir Thomas Munro and the intervention of Mr. Arthur Henderson were so successful that, notwithstanding the smallness of the concession, the men have accepted the position and are at work.II.-&quot;EMBARGO&quot; COMMITTEE OP INQUIRY.Since the last report, several meetings of the &quot; Embargo&quot; Committee of Inquiry, over which Mr. Justice McCardie is presiding, have been held. The witnesses whose evidence has so far been taken are Mr. Taylor of the Ministry of Munitions, the local labour officers of the Ministry of Munitions at Coventry, the manager of the Coventry Employment Exchange, representatives of the Coventry Engineering Joint Committee and the Coventry Aircraft Committee, Coventry representatives of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, the Amalgamated Society of Toolmakers, the Steam Engine Makers&apos; Society, the United Machine Workers&apos; Association, and representatives of the four Coventry firms on which embargoes had been laid, and of the Coventry Engineering Employers&apos; Association. The Committee have also made arrangements to hear evidence from representatives of Birmingham employers and workpeople and of the national bodies of employers and workpeople in the industries concerned.* For the purpose of these statistics munition workers are taken to include all classes of workers in respect of whom the Ministry of Munitions would intervene in the event of a strike (a) in the munition industries proper (metals, chemicals, and rubber); and (b) in certain auxiliary industries, e,gr,, iron ore mining, brick making, timber sawing, &quot;certified&quot; gas and electricity undertakings, &amp;c.a   (33)6420   Pk 60   125   8/18   E A: &amp;
