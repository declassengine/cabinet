I circulate the attached Report of the National Labour Priority Committee. I think that it is essential in the interest of the various industries involved that the recommendations contained in the Report should be approved.

Ministry of National Service,Westminster.NATIONAL LABOUR PRIORITY COMMITTEE.It is understood from statements which have been made in Par-liwraent that arrangements have boen made with the German Government for the exchange of all prisoners of war who have been in captivity for over 18 months, and that these arrangements will commence to be operative as soon as ratifications have been exchanged, which may be anything from one to two months.   In these circumstances it is necessary to consider the position that will arise as regards labour supply in this country.There are some 50,000 German prisoners employed in this country on work of great importance, work moreover which necessitates the employment of able-bodied men, and if these men are removed It will not be possible to replace them because men of the requisite physical grade are not now available.   These prisoners are employed not mere-ly on agriculture, but on timber vrork, dolomite, quarrying, ship** yards, roadmaking, excavating and constructional work and other heavy manual labour.   An analysis of their allocation is given in the attached Table.It Is estimated that approximately $0% of these men have been in captivity for over 18 months, and a very serious position;;.will arise if these men are removed without adequate arrangements for their replacement having been made beforehand^The matter was fully discussed at the meeting of the National Labour Priority Committee held on July 31strand the following pro-posals were unanimously approved by the Committee.There are at the moment a considerable number of German pris-oners employed behind the lines in Franco and it Is suggested that as and when the German prisoners in. this country are sent back to Germany their places should be*Haken by the more recently captured prisoners working In France, and that these in their turn should be replaced In France by coloured labour. It Is possi-ble to employ this coloured labour in Prance, indeed very large numbers are being employed there, but it is not practicable to employ it in this country.Arrangements for giving effect to these proposals would ne-cessarily take time to complete.   The matter is one which will have to bo referred to General Headquarters In France and it would affect not merely the War Office but also no doubt the Shipping Controller.It is accordingly suggested that these proposals should be laid before the IVar Cabinet with a view to obtaining a decision on the matter at the earliest possible date in order that there may be ample time to effect the necessary arrangements for substltut-ing the repatriated men.   Failing this there must undoubtedly be serious dislocation in several very important industries in this country.Practically all the Labour Employing Departments are affect-ed, they are all represented on the National Labour Priority Committeej and they are all in accord with the proposals set out above.(Sgd)   C.P.Rey.Chairman.
