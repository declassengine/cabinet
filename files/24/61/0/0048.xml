WAR Caj3I  i.1 &apos;&apos;r,lj,rr&quot;&apos;&apos;&apos;&quot;   &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;The Release, before General Demobilisation, of &quot;Demobilises&quot;     and &quot;pivotal ;.&apos;en.H.................^    . /-\v, Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War,1,     In their second Interim Report, sir, Montagu&apos;s Reconstruction Committee on Arm^: Demobilisation recommended that nSpecial arrangements should be made with, the War Office uy the himstry of Lao-pur before the end of the war, if possible, for priority in demooilisation, immediately peace is assured, of men specially required in connection with the V40TK of demobilisation;   for example, the officers of the War Office and the jCrapioyment Department serving with cue Colours, police, and certain number of men belonging to railway services.   These and similar men should be demouilised in adv;uice of all others, as their services are necessary in order to carry out the subsequent stages of demobilisation,&quot;2,     The Ministry of Labour accordingly approached the several Government Departments concerned to obtain an estimate of the numbers of such &quot;demobiUsers&quot; as were considered necessary by the compet/ent authorities.   I am advised that the total at present estimated is 20,000,3,    Mr, Hontagu&apos;8 Committee also recommend thai &quot;the question how far these special arrangements can be extended to other m-3n belonging to tlvj public services or to similar &quot;pivotal men&quot; in industry should be further considered by the War Office and the Ministry of Lao our after consultation with the Departments concerned,&quot;4,    Accordingly the Inter-departmental Committee which has also been in consultation with the Labour Resettlement Committee has considered the question in some detail and lias recommended that &quot;pivotal men&quot; in industry and commerce should be recognised as a dis&apos;-inct class and that on cessation of hostilities a limited number should be released in advance of   the commencement of general demobilisation.5c The nuiioer of &quot;demobilisers&quot; and pivotal men&quot; should not exceed, approximately, 150,000 in all and of course the release of any number must be suDjecu to the military exigencies at the moment.6.   If such a scheme is to be adopted steps must.be taKen as soon as possible to set up, where it does not now evist, machinery for selecting the industries to be recognised as entitled to claim &quot;pivotal men&quot;, and the occupations within those industries properly to ue re&amp;^rded as &quot;pivotal&quot;, for apportioning among the selected industries the appropriate shares of the numb-irs to be allowed, and for earmarxin^ the individuals to be released accordingly,   Ijus entails reference by the Einistry of Labour to representatives of utuiy industries, and involves a certain amount of unavoidable publicity.   The107selection
selection of the de^ooi Users will      WAinly for Government Departments and publ-tc authorities, and the publicity entailed is probably considerable,7.    The proposals have the approval of the Military Authorities.3.    it does not appear necessary to trouble the Cabinet with any of the details of the machinery by which effect would be given to the Scheme, but &quot;the Government should decide whether they can accept the publicity involved.   The measures required should be taicen as soon as possible.19th August, 1918.MILKER.
