utn - sand.....Aug. .191a.i M.lfe,HK:*   The Germans have agreed that Iteaieh vessels sailing from r-onmark to gouth Amerioa end tho Far flasft to lift cargoes for Denmark may carry goods from the United States to their ports of destination on tho outward voyage*    there is no?/ no really serious difficulty in the way of the proposed Agreement between isenmark and the Associated Governments.    The Danish delegates at ttft&amp;Mttffttm are stipulating that tho seals of values for Danish shipping chartered to the Allies shall be e^ual to the Eorwegiea and Swedish scale.  Ehoy ask that our promis1 to supply 100,000 tons of British coal monthly shall be free of our proposed express reservation regarding home and Allied requirements. They also object to our suggestion that the presentsAaglo-l&amp;uaish Agrees me&amp;t should still be operative in the event of the new American-Danish&quot;Agreement being determined.    The United states War Trade Board are. in-olined to give way on those points, which they do not consider to,be materials* BQBIAI.    Under the now ftorwogian Agreement the Associated Goveramentg may not discriminate against Norwegian firm on the sole ground that they traded with - the enemy before the Agreement was signed.  The Hor-wegiaa Government have offered in gill eases where a suggest Norwegian, firm is admitted to the privileges of the Agreement to require a doc-laration that the firm in question will abandon, all trade, direct or indirect, with the. enemy so long eg the rc&amp;r continues.&apos; The Norwegian Government are not apparently disposed to support very warmly the cause if Mom&amp;p;itm. firms blacklisted or notified as under&apos; suspicion by the allies and aro showing- every desire to arrive at a speedy settlement of the question, whioh may be agreeable to the Associated Governments.The liorweglsn Government have asked that Uortvegion vosseels sail-, ing under German safe-conducts may not be brought into a United  ingdos) port and thus exposed to the risks of tho danger sons. Govern-wat h*svo intln&amp;ted that  hey will, accord the ordinary facilities to &apos;
such vessels clearing immediately inward or outward without prejudice to our final decision upon the Norwegian-German Agreement in regard to safe-conducts. This agreement has been transmitted to London and is now under consideration.

The Norwegian representatives who recently went to Berlin to negotiate the safe-conduct agreement were sounded by the Germans on the question of a new commercial understanding. Germany desired to secure (a) 1,000 tons of cod liver oil, (b) an undertaking that Norway would not discriminate against German trade after the war, and (c) an assurance that after the war Norway would allow Germany free transit for German goods over Norwegian territory. The Norwegian delegates could not agree to any of these proposals. M. Ihlen has assured Sir. M. Findlay that the Norwegian Government are strongly opposed to binding Norway by an Agreement with Germany in respect of post bellum trade.

SWEDEN. The Swedish Government have incurred responsibilities towards the German Government which involve a breach of their Agreement with the Associated Governments. The Swedish Government made an arrangement with Germany in April last under which they were to receive 150,000 tons of coal monthly in return for 25 tons of impregnated canvas (presumably for aeroplanes), 50 tons of animal hair, 100,000 tons of wood pulp, 27,690 tons of spinning paper and other commodities. It was also agreed in April that the Store Kopparberg Birgalage Company should send 40,000 tons of pyrites to Germany annually in return for coal and coke required by the Company. The Swedish Government granted export licences for the whole 40,000 tons of pyrites while M. Marcus Wallenberg was in London negotiating the Swedish Agreement with the Associated Governments. 18,000 tons were sent before the Allied Swedish Government was ratified and 7,000 tons were exported subsequently. The Swedish Government argue that the exports in question are covered by notes exchanged when the Allied-Swedish Agreement was signed to the effect that certain export licences already granted to Ger
lany in re turn xor o ompen eatl on goods should not be cancelled.  M. Ifallenberg., who is Chairman of the Hopparberg Co. has assured Bir. 2. low&amp;rd that he was not informed of the proposed exports of py itea to tor many and that on hearing of the matter bo udvised the Swedish Gov-;-rnmcnt bo suspend any iUrther deliveries,   i^lr $. Howard is not in-jllned-to &quot;believe that the Swedish Government have -acted in bad faith, but he hold out no hope that H.&amp;. Government would sanction any exports !iO Qem?j&amp;$ in hreaoh of the Allied-Swedish Agreement *i M&apos;M.ii-.L. $here have been further Informal conversations at tbe &apos;I ague regarding the proposed general Agrees at between Holland and the Assoeiated Govemiasnts,   M. Snouok has agreea to prepare .a short end frank memorandum xor il.ll. Government stating what supplies Holland must o tain from Germany, and what commodities she proposes to send to Germany in exchange.   B.U. Commercial Attache at the  eg us has warned M* Snouck that any vital mollifications in the. December proposals will re-quire to be aoasldered by all the Allies.  .lt is evident from li. 3nonek1s. remarks that the netherlands Government contemplate Important, exports of Butch produce to Germany, but that they are not. prepared to sanction any appreciable exports to the United Kingdom,   $he Netherlands Government continue to press for a speedy settlement *   She United States Minister at the Hague, who fears that tho Netherlands Oovernmsnt may he forced by popular agitation to seise Kelief cargoes proceeding to Belgium via Hotter dam, has again advocated offering Holland supplies of important commodities priding tbs oonolueion of a general Agreement, lir f. &apos;fownley has discussed this matter with M. -Lou(ion.   $he latter is not in favour of a modus Vivendij he would prefer to negotiate a general Agreement as soon as possible.    le assures us that tbsre is no real danger at present of any inWrforence -with iollef supplies..   -&apos; . &apos;&apos;       &apos;       - . &apos; . -.     *&apos;Bi. f *?S&amp;%&amp;A &amp;%iSlt &apos;     .-. ?i&amp;^VS 111^111 O^AIfta.   fbe following is a uumra&amp;ry of the losses to merchant shipping, due to enemy activity, which were reported in %eN  . period Aug. 16.  2, inclusive.
