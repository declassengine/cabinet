The training of &apos;the recently arrived&apos;dXvisions is being pushed on and, as wasindicated last week, another of the divisions which arrived in June has moved from the training area and has gone/into - the line in a. quiat sector.-   3 of these June divisions are therefore already being made use of,: Shipping.     In July the total number of troops which left America was 303,715, of wnich British tonnage, carried 191,715.     The programme , laid down for July was therefore carried out and it is expected that that for August will also be completed, except that, owing to the demands for aviation and-tank units and coloured troops not previously allowed for, about 68,000 service of supply-troops of the First American Army will not be brought over until September,No
No official programme for September has yet. been formulated but preparations will be made to ship in the following order :-Balance of service of supply troops c...... 68,000Replacement troops ,...,, a . 35,0004 Divisions complete,If tonnage permits 6 divisions will be shipped,   These preparations are entirely provisional as it is expected that a considerable amount of the September tonnage will be required for cargo.   If this turns out to be the case only service of supply and&quot;replacement troops will be shipped, the remainder of the tonnage being used for cargo.   This whole question however, will be brought up at the next meeting of the Supreme war Council,Operations.(a) The First American Army (consisting of the I and III Corps) under the temporary command of General Pershing has now taken over the command of the sector of the line between BRAINE and FISHES from the 6th French Army,   There are at present 7 divisions (all complete with Artillery) in these Corps, only 2 of which are in the line, the remainder of the First Army front being held by French troops,     4- of the remaining 5 divisions of the I and III Corps have been recently engaged in battle and are now in reserve,. The other division has just been relieved from the line in ALSACE.   7 divisions (3 completev&apos;*with artillery) are in line and one is in reserve on the French Quiet front,(b) On the British front one Regiment of Americans was in the line in the neighbourhood of ALBERT at the commencement of the AMIENS battle on 8th August,   Subsequently this Regiment was increased to one Brigade,   The other Brigade of the Division was engaged with British troops on the following day in the success-ful advance towards BRAY-sur-SOMME,(c) The following is a short summary of the operations engaged in by the 1st American Division south of S0ISS0NS from July 18th - 24th inclusiveAfter being relieved from the CANTIGNY Sector on 9th July the Division proceeded to its rest area,   During the night 15th/ 16th July the Division commenced to move towards the S0ISS0NS area with a view to relieving a sector of the front in the vicinity of C0EUVRES.   The movement was completed on 17th July on which day orders were received that the Division would-attack at 4.45 the next morning as the left front Division of the French Corps to which it was attached,   The right Brigade reached all its object-ives (three) on the 18th, but the -left Brigade only got as far as the second objective owing to the Division on its left failing to capture its final objective.   The attack was resumed on the 19th and continued till the 22nd when the Division had established itself on the line BERZY LE SEC - CHATEAU THIERRY - SOISSONS ROAD - Heights North of VISIGNEUX.   The infantry were relieved on the night 22nd/23rd July and the artillery on the following two nights.The total casualties suffered by the Division in this fighting were estimated to be about 7,000, the casualties among infantry officers, especially field officers, being very heavy.About 3,500 prisoners were taken and 68 field guns (77 mm, and 150 mm,) were actually captured by this Division. .  ^The
The points worthy of remark are(ij $he successful advance of 11 kilcsastres against determined resistance?(ii) that the division held all the ground it took.(iii) that it continued the attack longer than any neigh- . bouring Division without &quot;being reinforced, anc.(iv) the excellent arrangements for transmission of orders, It was very noticeable that orders for the attack from tho French Corps to whioh this Division was attached were issued in some cases 12 hours before the attack was timed to take place *     That the Division did so sell in spite of this reflects the greatest credit on the Staff work.5.   Casualties *     A more accurate return of casualties has now been furnisne3 and up to 31st July the total losses in the American Expeditionary Force (including died of disease but not including slightly wounded) were as follows :-Killed.
