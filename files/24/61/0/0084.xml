(1).Reference No-.------------21st August, 1918*Sir,I beg to submit the following Report on the work of the Pood Production Department for the week ended 20th August.-Weather and Condition of Props, The ideal weather experienced during the past week has enabled rapid progress to be made with the ingathering of the harvest.    Com crops, especially wheat, are reported to be heavy. Hay crops have nearly all been carried and pastures give promise of abundant keep.    The condition of potatoes and roots has improved.LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION. Cultivation of Lands Order* It has been found necessary to rescind the Cultivation of Lands Order, 1918, owing to the changes in procedure made by the Corn Production (Amendment) Act, 1918, especially the grantof a right of appeal in respect of certain orders made by-Agricultural Executive Committees and the transfer to arbitrators of the power to decide upon claims for loss in connection with such orders.    A new Order has now been made under Regulation 2M which provides that in connection with the orders, to which reference is made above, the occupier or owner served with the order shall have notice that he.may require a reference to arbitration.This Order alters the powers of Agricultural Executive Committees so far as they are affected by the Com Production (Amendment) Act.
An explanatory memorandum with regard to orders and apj ha3 been Issued and a further memorandum with regard to- the of claims for compensation Is being prepared. Credit for Farmers - Returns received show that up to the 30th J 1918, the number of applications approved by Agricultural Exeoutl Committees in England and Wales was 757, comprising a total sum; only  62,574. It is estimated that about nine-tenths of this s has actually been borrowed, the remainder representing loans whli have not been taken up. 1The Board have so far been called upon to discharge th( amount due in respect of only four loans, the total sum Involved being  136. 14. 3,HORTICULTURAL DIVISION,   &apos; Provision of Land for Allotments - Reports received from 1,184 distriots show that 314,924 applications have been made for plot under the Cultivation of Lands Order 1917 (Ho.2), and that 289,6 plots containing 20,934 acres have been provided.During the week three local authorities have agreed U acquire, in addition to the area mentioned above, 17 aores (253 allotments), including an additional 8 aores at Chislehurst.   I Beckenham 9052 of the 7,900 householders have gardens in whioh vegetable cultivation is being carried on, while in addition the are 2,200 allotment holders.    At Tavistock 75$ of the 800 house holders have gardens which are properly cultivated, while in addition rather more than half the householders have each an allotment of approximately 13 poles.    At Axminster 60$ of the 4 householders are cultivating gardens while 30$ are also cultiv&amp;t an, allotment of approximately 10 poles.A considerable area of allotments lying at the south west corner of Richmond Park has been inspected.    The vegetable, ,crops are very poor indeed, and show the need of proper instruot among the cultivators, as it is evident that they are ignorant * the fundamental principles which govern soil working.
Basket Making - Work is to-be commenced with German prisoners at Gore Farm next week and four of the men who are skilled basket makers are to be uaed as instructors.Fruit and Vegetable Preservation - The total number of glass jars ordered from the Ministry of Munitions up to the 10th August v,ras 6,973,002.

Small Live Stock - During the week 334 persons have been put in touch with one another for the purpose of sale and purchase of rabbits,   70 &quot;Doe Centres&quot; have been established by the National Utility Rabbit Association.TECHNICAL DIVISIOH, As evidence of the improvement which is being effected in tillage, the following reports on farms taken over by Leicestershire Agricultural Executive Committees are of interest:-(1) Stoke Lodge Farm, Stoke Golding (132 acres) taken over in July of last year,   had been, deplorably neglected by the previous tenants.   Much of the tillage land was over-imn with dock&apos;, the ditches had not been cleaned out: for many years, and the hedges were overgrown.     The present management i3 in the hands of&apos; the Hinckley District Committee, who have shown great energy in bringing the farm
into order.    The ditches have been cleaned, new drains put in, aM hedges cut down.   It was necessary to fallow the greater part of tho arable land, but the crops on the remainder look well,, and a large will be sown with wheat this autumn.(2) Whittington Grange &apos;Farm, Markfield (111 acres), was all un grass when taken over in May 1917. The drainage had been badly neglected, and it was necessary to lay between 15,000 and 16,000 pip The ditches have been cleaned out and the hedges cut down. The whol of the land has been broken up, and is now carrying 95 acres of whea 6 acres of oats and 10 acres of potatoes. The crops generally look extremely well, and the land is very clean.(3) Charley Hall Farm, Charley (88 acres) was taken over in Ma 1917. The soil is poor, thin and very stony, but in spite of this crops, especially the wheat, are very good.(4)   Ragdale Hall, Ragdale (387 acres), was to a large extent derelict when taken over in Kay, 1917.   This year the cropping inclui 155 acres of wheat, 38 acres of oats and 11 acres of mangels.    The wheat crop is a wonderful sight.    Special reference must be made to a field of &quot;Benefactor&quot;, 23 acres in extent, which was the best crop seen in the county and estimated by some local farmers to yield S quarters to the acre.    It is a magnificent crop,&quot; over 6 ft. high, with well-filled ears, and perfectly uniform,   The soil on the farm is mostly poor and the results of breaking up are, therefore, all the more striking.    There could hardly be a better illustration- of what may be done on derelict land with skilful&apos; management. Northamptonshire.(5)   Gawthrop&apos;s Farm, Kettering (60 acres arable), was wholly derelict and over-run with weeds when taken over last December, About 7 acres were cleaned in the Spring and sown with barley, which looks promising, and 8 acres are being bare fallowed in preparation for wheat.    Twenty&apos;acres have been relinquished to the owners for quarrying for iron, and the remainder (about 24 acres) has&apos; been let to the local Allotment Association: most of the land has been cleaned and is growing satisfactory crops.
9 r r &amp; t) U(6)   Wood Lane Farm, Weekley (178 acres), had been badly managed by the previous tenants.     Possession was taken last December, and the farm is now on its way to complete restoration, and will be given up next Lady Day on condition that the landlord finds a tenant whom the Committee approves. Devonshire.(7)   Great Bidlake Farm, Bridestowe ,(134 acres), was takenover by the at presentWest Devon &quot;Executive Committee last Ootober, and is used &quot;aa;&apos;a&apos; graining.centre for women.    The farm was all in grass, but 73 acres&apos;have been ploughed up and are now carrying corn, roots and potatoes.    Exciept for a certain amount of ploughing last autumn the whole of the work has been done by Women.    The buildings are kept in excellent and clean condition, and the farmyard is one of the best-kept that the Inspector has seen this summer. .&apos;, .LABOUR DIVISION.Agricultural Labour and Military ,Service.   At a conference between the Department, the Local Government Board and the Ministry of .
