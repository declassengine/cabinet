(THIS WCVMMl. 15 9Z.3I &amp; - B^ITAMI C. JAJESTV,&apos; 3 GOVERNMENT.)s ;E.;c R E, T*,    / 7/X. WAR CABINET..G.T. 5451. *177LEAKAGE 0]? INFORMATION.Memorandum &quot;by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.With reference to paragraph 2 of War Cabinet Minutes No. 460,  tho press were informed at the Press Lecture delivered on the afternoon of Thursday, the 15th instant, that British troops had reached Baku and were taking part in the defence of that place.   Thin announcement was designedly made in view of the fact that British troops had already been in action and had suffered casualties there.   It was,  therefore, quite certain that the presence of British troops was known to the enemy and it was considered, desirable to anticipate any enemy announce-ment in connection with the operations,   pur the-r details were mentioned in the course ef the lecture confidentially and not for publication, and there appears to have been some misunder-standing in this respect, but certain items of information were published which were distinctly stated to be confidential by the lecturer.   A case in point is the mention of the Caspian shipping, which was published only in the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; to begin with.   The verbatim report of the lecture reads as follows :-&quot;We cannot depend upon the force being able to hold &quot;Baku.   We hope at least (and. this is confidential) that &quot;one result of our going there will be that we shall be &quot;able to secure the shipping on the Caspian, ana in the &quot;event of necessity that we shall be able to withdraw &quot;our troops,.&quot;As regards this particular item, at any rate, there could, have been no room for doubt.Steps are being taken to guard against any repetition of such mi sunderstanding in the future.(Sd.)   p, de B. RADCLIFFE,D6M.O. for C.I.G.S.War Office,17th August, 1918.
