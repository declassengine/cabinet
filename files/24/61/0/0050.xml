NORTOIAN TOFJAGE AGREII&amp;fENT*This Agreement was finally concluded in June 1917, and has now been in effective operation for 13 months.The object of the Agreement was to secure for Norway the maintenance of her coal and coke supplies and to secure for Allied Service the whole of the Norwegian Mercantile Marine except such tonnage was was necessary to maintain Norway&apos;s essential imoorts.    A few rogular Cargo Liners have been left in tho North Sea trade by subsequent Agreement*The Norwegian North Sea tonnage requisitioned and time chartered has been engaged mainly in the coal trade between this country and Franco, whilst the remainder of the Norwegian tonnage securod has been engaged in British and Allied Service in various parts of the world mainly in the war zone,The Norwegian coal supplies have been maintained by armed British vessels under the complete   control of tho Ministry of Shipping,    Th$s central control has resulted in an efficient and economical use of tonnage.The British vessels introduced into the Norwegian trade number. 97*with an aggregate-gross tonnage of 162?600 tonsThe Losses have boon...

Until recently the Norwegian Government and private consumers wore   &apos; generally satisfied with the quantities delivered.    Butfife $he&apos; past two months, as a result not of lack of tonnage but&quot;     tho serious shortago of coal, shipments have been unsatisfactory, but it is hoped that with en increased out-put of coal,shipments; may/
may be maintained at a reasonable 3-evel from the point of view of Norwegian requirements*Freights are collected in kroner in Norway and are paid over to the account of the Treasury.    They have been successively reduced to correspond with the actual costs of the service as required by the Agreement.The control of tonnage by the Ministry of Shipping has facilitated control of Import8*    Approximately 600,000 tons of oargo were delivered in IT.X. between October j 1917, and June, 1918 by the British vessels in the service,    The following is a summary of these imports:-TonsFood.&quot;frish - Fresh )Salted &amp; ).. 42,190Canned )&apos; Fish Oil.3,241Other Food......      613Total46,044io of Total7.6MunitionsIron Ore....

I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,(Signed) JOHN ANDERSON.Heavy shipments of Iron Ore have recently teen made from Narvik to ensure reasonable supplies aespite the fact that tonnage previously engaged on the White Sea route was no longer available on account of Russia dropping out of the war.    His Majesty1a Government has secured control of the output of Norwegian pyrites mines and regular supplies of this commodity should be assured.As regards Timber, prior to the agreement rates if freight were about  22 per standard and the Government Timber Buyer was experiencing great difficulty in securing tonnage,    His wants are now met at a frei^kt rate not exceeding  10 per standard,With regard to imports of fish from Norway, 17461 tons of fresh herrings wore imported during the Norwegian Herring Season and it was found possible to make such arrangements that herring were   &apos; shipped alive in Norway and delivered In a marketable condition at East Coast ports ?/ithin three or four days.    fhe quantity which reached this country unfit for food was negligible.    I:; addition 2200 tons of salted fish were carried.For many of the commodities dealt with Horway Is our nearest geographical source of supply,&apos; and so long as coal is forthcoming to enable steamers to bo loaded without delay any essential supplies of oreSj timber, and wood pulp can be maintained in the shape of return cargoes,.The Eorth Sea convey system was completely re-organised In January 1918 and not only from the point of view of safety frf vessels but also from that of regular and quick passages the new arrangements have contributed greatly to the smooth working of the service.It may he stated that at the outset the War Risk was estimated on a basis of 15$ per round voyage.    The actual percentage of loss does not however exceed 4$ on the British vessels in the trade.   As regards length of voyage the actual time at sea between this country and Bergen is on the average about 48 hours or little above pre-war times. Over 2*700 vessels have been convoyed outwards and homewards,
