Hisi mi15-  ORAIN PRICES FOR 13.18 HARVEST. $Jj.$If )        Memorandum by the Food Controller.1.   By minute of August 27th 1917 (\7.C. 190 Para, i) the War Cabinet decided -that the mean price of wheat of the 1917 harvest shculd be 72/- for 480 lbs. and that the price cf barley and oats should be on a parity,   On this basis Lord Rhondda fixed the prices of grain by the Grain Prices Order 1917 in accordance with the following scale:-Y/heat and rye per 504 lbs.Barleyper 440 lbs.Oatsper 306 lbs.Commencing price 73/6.Flat rate for the whole season Milling 62/9 Malting 68/-Commencing price 44/3(--Average price 75/71.Average price 46/4^.--)Milling qualities 3/- extra.These prices were fixed on a generous basis far above the scale of the Corn Production Act with the express intention of encouraging the largest possible production.3,   In June of this year an Order was drafted by the Home Cereals Committee.of the Wheat Commission, fixing the prices for the 1918 harvest in accordance with the following scale:-Wheat and Rye per 504 lbs-.Barleyper 448 lbs.Catsper 336 lbs./9;Commencing price       Average price 73/6. 75Flat rate for whole season, 65/-Commencing price       Average price44/6.46VMilling qualities 3/- extra.These/
These prices are approximately the same as those fixedfor 1917 with the substitution of an intermediate, barley price,securing the producer a similar aggregate return to that of1917, for the differential rate for malting barley which hadexcited political criticism.     At the time the order was draftednotI had no roason to suppose that these prices were/accepted by the three Departments of Agriculture which are all represented on the Home Cereals Committee.    The prices are slightly higher than those which had been promised by Lord Rhondda in January in an announcement issued by him jointly with the three Agricultural Departments,3.   The publication of the Order was delayed until it had been considered by the recently appointed Agricultural Advisory Council.     They considered the prices inadequate and asked that the price of wheat should be raised to 80/- as a commencing price and 82/3 as an average: that the barley price should be a flat price of 67/6 for milling and 72/6 for malting qualities; and that the price of oats 3hould be raised to 50/- as a commencing price and 52/3 as an average with 3/- extra for milling quali-tiss.   The demand for increased prices was based on the increased cost of production and was supported by the three Departments of Agriculture.40   Although I yield to none in my anxiety to give every reasonable encouragement to the farmer to secure the maximum food&apos; production I was unable to agree to the prices suggested by the Agricultural Advisory Council for the following reasons:-(i)       I realise that nothing is more difficult todetermine than the cost of the production of grain, but 1 was not satisfied that tin prices proposed in the Draft Order failed to provide a fr-ir remunera-tion to the farmer.   The 1917 prices were, asstated/
stated above, fixed on a very generous basis, Tho increase in the cost of production is not so serious as is sometimes stated for though wages have risen this increase only dates back to the month of May and therefore only applies to a small part of the present year.   The cost of production is not materially affected by other factors.   Only a limited number of farmers have to buy agricultural implements now at the -present high prices. Fertilisers have only increased by a small percent-age.   Since last year much of the cereal crop is being groira on the accumulated fertility of tha grass lando which have been ploughed.    The yield of wheat tc the acre thi3 year is likely to be very exceptionally high while tho yield of barley and oats is, I am advised, above the normal,(ii) Increased prices will load to a domand forincreased wages and once more wc- shall be involved in the vicious circle which the policy of stabilizing prices was designed to prevent,(ill) Every additional shilling In the price of homo-grown wheat means an increase of  375,000 in the bread subsidy, while a shilling on barley means an increase of  ,140,000.   An increase in the price of oats will in the view of the Costings Department of the Ministry, who have carefully investigated the matter., necessitate an increase in the pri.o$ of oatmeal with consequential discontent, especially in Scotland and the North of England,(iv) The price suggested in the Draft Order forhome-grown wheat exceod3 the price paid to the American producers,    They have pressed stronglyfor/
I 118A-tIfor an Increase and a bill to effect this was actually1 $Ipassed by Congress.   This bill was vetoed by the Presl-dent on the ground, I am told, that allied consumers should not be further penalised in the prices cf essent-ial foodstuffs,   Lord Reading tells me that in his opinion if the price is raised in this country, it will be most difficult for the American Administration to maintain their opposition,   He strongly deprecates any increase   ctf the existing price for wheat in this country if it can be /avoided.   An extra shilling on the price of American wheat means a further increase in the bread subsidy of approx-Imately  1,000,000, (v) An increase in the price of American wheat as the re- .suit of an increased price to British farmers would be cer-tain to excite criticism and resentment in allied countries, 5,.;      In spite of the very serious objections urged in the last Iparagraph I was prepared, out of a gbnuine desire to do nothing to dis-bourage production, to allow, subject to Treasury sanction, an increase ftn the prices of barley and oats but I felt unable to make any concess-\don in the price proposed for wheat in view of the very exceptional yield Expected this year, I am advised that my proposal would not affect the parity enough to endanger the production of wheat; and its effect In I Imerlca would probably be negligible.   The Treasury has been asked to I sanction this proposal but has refused on the ground that there is no I :lear evidence of the necessity for an increase,   I am prepared to offer pin increase of 2/- in the price of barley and 3/- in the price of,oats jtasr the prices, fixed in the Draft Order if the Treasury consent. The (increase on barley would involve an increase of  280,000 in the bread : subsidy? oats are not used as a diluent In the loaf,6.       AB dealings in this yearls crops have already begun, It is fjf urgent importance that the maximum prices should be announced.Itrrjnedlatfelyt, .f - J, R, CLYNES.1 ministry of Food. 17th August, 1318.
