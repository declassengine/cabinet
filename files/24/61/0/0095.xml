24.8 IPITNAVAL EFFORT OF GREAT BRITAIN AND THE UNITEDSTATES OF AMERICAAdmiralty Memorandum for tho War Cabinet0I think that in view of tho matter I put forward inand cf tho s^seqr.ent Conference held y-S;^^^^e8&apos;llden5,of Secretary of state for Foreign an airs, the attached quotations from the &quot;EmerTenov fipS* News&quot; of the 11th July!l91S3 (a periodioll publishod at^ Philadelphia by the UftS9Shipning R^ard Emergency Fleet Corporation) may be      interostlrg and instructive&quot;Any doubts as tc the intention of America having &quot;the greatest merchant marine in the world following &quot;the war were set at rest by Mrjlurley in his &quot;address to the manufacturersn   The speaker told &quot;the manufacturers that -&quot;upon them, more than any other class of people, &quot;rested the responsibility of utilising to -their &quot;greatest advantage the ships that the country &quot;will have after &quot;the ware&quot;We bave depended upon manufacturers to &quot;build the ships, and noyf that they are coming &quot;along, and the new American mercantile marine &quot;is to be the largest in the world, we must &quot;look to manufacturers to find work for these ships after the war is over.&apos;,&quot;The more vigorously we fight the war., the &quot;more tonnage we shall have at our disposal when Hpeace is declared,,   I believe that wise fcre-hsight now, in utilising this tonnage after the &quot;war, to develop our own world trade, and develop -Hrade and industry in other countries, particularly the smaller and yc-viigev nations, will be a direct &quot;help to winning the war, not a hindrance,11As a farther illustration of the attitude of theUBS,, Government upon the questions dealt with in Paper GftTa 5307 I think the War Cabinet is aware that the Board cf Admiralty recently agreed that, having regard to the great effort which is being made in this country in connection with the repair cf American Naval Vessels, it would not be unreason-able to ask the UftStGovernment to compensate the British Government in kind for the loss of shipbuilding capacity entailed by the assignment tc the United States Naval Vessels of the extensive repair facilities involved, and in this view Admiral Sims concurred and stated that he felt sure that his Government would give most sympathetic consideration to any proposals which might be put forwardeThe Board cf Admiralty accordingly suggested tc theUtScGovernment, through Admiral Sims,, that t e compensation to be made in respect&quot;of the labour equivalent cf the UPS, repairs for 1918 should be 5 Oilers (being a portion of the 8 Oilers building in the UeS,,A, to our order at the outbreak cf war and which had been taken over by the American Govern-ment).   This request was forwardedby Admiral Sims to his Government and a reply has now been received from him to the effect that the United States rfovy Department is unable at the present time tc arrange for the assignment or transfer of
vessels fx%m the United States to the British Flag,,I regret that I could not be present at the Conference presided over by the Secretary of State for Foreign,Affairs which was appointed by the War Cabinet 6 I think 0 Iweverj that in view of the extracts quoted above and the answer of&apos;the U^S,,Government upon tho question of making compensation&apos;in kind for the repair of their Naval Vessels&quot;in this country 8 the War Cabinet may consider that the matter needs further consideration.(SgcfJ   ERIC GEDDES 024/8 A8.
