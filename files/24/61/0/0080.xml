O BE-6ltn ?b*&amp;. \7AR CAB DUST.^ 4 317*r-     tvPay of Officers of the Serbian Army.&apos; ^//Memorandum by Secretary of State for War.For many months past my attention has been drawn to  , the ^difficult position of the Officers of the Serbian Army in 1 Macedonia.   They are paid on a scale wliSUi was inadequate even , for tlie very simple conditions of life which prevailed in Serbia before the war, and the Skupshtina was in fact contemplating in 1914 an increase averaging about 30 per cent all round.   This , was never effected owing to the outbreak of thf war, and the old rates ranging frma 150 dinars (nominally  6) a month in the case of a 2nd lieutenant to 456 dinars (nominally  18) a month in the case of a Lieutenant-Colonel still prevails   Bven the present Chief of Staff, Voivode Misitch, only gets the equivalent of  324 a yeart and a Serbian Divisional Commander gets less than a British Lieutenant.In Macedonia  the coat of everything is inordinately high and  is further increased by the rate of exchange against the Serbian dinar.   The Officers are almost all men without any private means;   such tm as have had any have exhausted- them. In a very large number of cases the little pay they get is transmitted through Switzerland, at a ruinoue loss in exchange, to their families in Serbia to &amp;eep them from absoluteThey sr^ thus quite unable, for the most part, to take $art in such social intercourse as exists among the Allied Armies $ or even to procure themselves this smallest personal comforts or luxuries.  The effect of this upon wn who have now been exiled from their homes and families for nearly three years, under evesy circumstance tending toward! depressions can well bo imagined. It speaks greatly for their intense patriotism that the spirit of the. Serbian Army haa bs*in so well maintained in spite of fh&amp;m discouraging influences*  But I am assured By all the British Off ice re who have been in close touch with the Serbian Army that nothing could do so much to sustain the S&amp;rbian Army during the coming winter and for the rest of the war m an ail round increase i&amp; officerf8 W*  As the result of the new agreement concluded with the French Government, the -rank and iWa will now be bettor fad and otthod than in the past*   It is onijv the case of the officers that still urgently requires to be dealt with.The form whioh this increase should take is, I am advised, not that of a      scale of pay, hut that of a flat rate ^iven to all ranks, in.addition to tfcfrir pre seat pay, as a Macedonian allowance  This would both be fairer to the junior ranks, whose eaaa is th&amp; hardest, and avoid all questions of new legislation by the Skupihtinau   The total number of Serbian officers, exclusive of those in Algiers, Biserta, Corsica and Marseilles is 5,158,   If the i%cedonian allowance is fixed at an \        additional lOfranos a day which is the figure recommended by General Plunlcett. the h&amp;&amp;&amp; of the British Mission with the
9 1 hSerbian Army, that would amount to a little over  700,000 a year. But even a smaller allowance, say 5 francs a day. or  350,000 a year, would have a marked effect.The recommendation which I wish to make to the War Cabinet is that the British Government should provide an increase at the rate of 5 francs a day as a gift to the Serbian Army.   Our experience with the United States in connection with a previous suggestion for an addition to the separation allowances of the Italian Army shows the difficulty of getting anything of the sort agreed between Allies.   As a matter of fact the Americans are already contributing independently of ourselves to the assistance of the Serbian civil population, and, to a small extent, towards the pay of the rank and file of the Serbian Army*   There is nothing to prevent the French Government adding to the amount we give, or earning the gratitude of the Serbians by some other special form of assistance.   But % am sure that both from the point of view of remedying the present unsatisfactory position of the Serbian officers, and from that of improving Anglo-Serbian relations, it will be better if ukc act entirely on our own initiative and that the matter be kept apart from the general arrangement between France and ourselves for the supply and maintenance of the Serbian Forces.MILDER o22nd August^ 1918.
