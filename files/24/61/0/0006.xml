During the last few months there has been a revival of this agitation, which, it is suggested by journals of an opposite tendency, is inspired from the Consulta and has for its object to limit the actualisation of the policy proclaimed at the Rome Congress in April last and then approved by the Italian Government.The! following notes will give an idea of the charac ter of&apos;the agination and of the uneasy feeling it has created among the sincere supporters of Italo-Slav co -operation.On iune 30th I1Bpoca, after noting that to Signer Orlando belongs the credit of reviving the Maaalatan policy of enlisting the co-operation of the oppressed nationalities in the Italian struggle with Austria, continues - &quot;But if this policy is willed by Signor Orlando, who today represents the nation end personifies the Government, to wham are we to attribute all that is being dene in opposition to the policy of an I vale-Slav entente?    In fact, while we rasd in the papers with lively satisfaction praise of the- 0 echo-Slovaks for their gallant conduct in the battle on the Pi&amp;m, the expression of sympathy addressed by General Stefarlfc to the Minister Orlando and warmly reciprocated by him and the declarations of the Jugo-Slav Committee, which har practical-ly transferred its quarters to Rome, with the replies of the
President of Council and of the Commander in OMef, wo are at the same time witnesses of a curious spectacle.    y/e have circu-lars clandestinely printed which are sent about the country stirring up suspicions of the Slavs;   then there are rumours going about with suspiciously identical circumstantial details suggestive of a single origin;   campaigns, which obscure organs, no longer able to carry them on in their editions for foreign circulation, commit to limited issues for local consumption; obstacles placed by the bureaucracy in the way of complete de-monstrations of Slav co-operation with our arms;   finally pam-phlets, of which, though they have not the wide circulation hoped for perhaps by their authors, copies are d&amp;s^nrnated and which are manifestly in conflict with the sincerity oi the Congress of Home Agreements.    These things could not happen unless there were some organising will in the background, which seems to hope that it may he possible to go back upon and deny all that has been so solemnly affirmed.&quot;    After pointing out the use which Austria1s propaganda is sure to make of such publications 1&apos;Epooa continues -   &quot;It would be well in this connection if on the analogy of the Czechoslovak army we could see also a Jugo-Slav and a Roumanian army on our front. Appeals from these nationalities have been published in the papers expressing their desire to take part in the struggle against the common foe, and it is right that we should know what has happened to these appeals.     Among our Allies too, who have witnessed with so much sympathy the new orientation of our policy, these demonstrations of an opposite tendency cannot but arouse painful suspicions, indeed we already see symptoms of this in an article which recently appeared from the pen, we have reason to believe, of one of the chief editors of a leading British journal&quot;.Professor SaJLvemini in 1&apos;Unita of July ECth answers articles written for the Resto del Oarlino by Francesco Coppola,
who, until recently, was prominent on the staff of the Idea Naaionalo, maintaining the old 1nationalist1 thesis that the Croats are all Austro-phil, and that friendship &quot;between Italians and Jugo-Slavs is impossible.    Salvemini (like L^Qpooa in the paragraph nuoted above) sees official prompting behind this anti Slav press propaganda.     He talks of &quot;Coppola and the highly-placed persons who provide him with his documents&quot;;   and at the end of his article writes more explicitly as follows:-   &quot;Coppola does not fail to point out to us that 1 there is still a Ministry in existence in Italy responsible for foreign policy, obedience to whose directions is imposed upon us as a duty by the disci-pline of war1 - Yes;   it exists, and to it belong both Orlando and Sonnino.     which are we to obey?    We wish that Signor Orlando would be so kind as to explain to us once for all and clearly whom we are to obey.     Or are we to obey no-one?     Is the Constantine-venizelos conflict to be reproduced in Italy?&quot;On July 6th the Corriere della Sera, publishes Signor Ojetti&apos;s very complete refutation of statements made in an article of the Resto del Carlino, enlarging on the services rendered by the Jugo-Slav troops to the recent Austrian offen-sive with obvious intention to create prejudice against the Slavs.V Unita of July 13th nuotes from on article of simi-lar tendency in a paper published at Udine, La Oazzetta del Veneto.I^Unita of July 29th notices a pamphlet entitled fI popoli oppress! della konarchia Austro-hungarica1, which, while supporting the theses of the Rome Congress of A^ril last (at which it will be remembered nothing definite was said about adjustment of territorial questions), contains maps in which the distribution of population in Drlmatia and the territory North of the Adriatic is misrepresented in favour of the
Italians.    Of this pamphlet 1&apos;Unita remarks:   &quot;The new tactics, in faot, amount to this:   no longer openly to cppose the movement in favour of Italo-Slav friendship and Jugo-Slav national unity; hut to eombine systematic sabotage of the movement with profes-sions of enthusiastic support.&quot; &quot;Idea ffajaiorale (July 19th) in an article entitled &quot;Unprofitable polemics&quot; takes for its starting point a letter in which the london Correspondent of the Giornalfe. d - Itai i a (July 16th) draws attention to &quot;the impression prevailing in certain English circles with regard to Italian foreign policy in relation to the oppressed nationalities1, and urges the necessity of removing these impressions by making it clear that no one is more eager than the Italians to see the Habsburg Empire wiped off the map in order to make place for liberally constituted States. &quot;jftfflL.ff.%*jlPrJ^?. sa^s &quot;tiia&quot;t &quot;this letter has provided certain Italian journals with fresh matter for polemics which it deprecates.    The subject is a highly delicate one and had better be left as it stands, i0e^ as it was formulated at the Congress of Rome.     The controversy is only between extremists of opposed tendencies.     &quot;The point of view&quot; the article con-eludes, &quot;sanctioned by the Rome Agreement in harmony with the lines of foreign policy followed by our Government, remains unaltered.     Italy can not and should not give up during thewar any of the guarantees with which she entered upon it.-Italy can and should practise a policy of sincere collaboration with the nationalities subject to Austria-Hungary.    These two principles do not exclude one another and have the loyal support of public opinion, of Signor Orlando and of Signor Sonnino&quot;.Radical opinion as expressed by I,&apos;Unit a (July 27th) is in formal agreement with the nationalist journal in regard to the guarantees given to Italy by the Treaty of London.     It
toolda that Italy would- be unwise to renounce thera;   but must eventually&quot;translate thera Into terms of what it calls &quot;the Wilsonian conception&quot;.    &quot;The Treaty of London embodies a principle which Italy should on no account abandon and of which she can demand full realisation not only from the Allies who signed the document but also from Y/ilson who did not sign it, if the Society of Nations on a democratic basis is not an empty phrase:   the principle, namely, that Italy has the right to remain secure on the Alps and in the Adriatic and to share in proportion io her needs in the advantages of the Colonial read-justment which will result from the War&quot;.    The writer proceeds to show in detail how the objects which certain territorial claims were intended to secure may be secured in a manner more consonant with democratic principles, by exchanging territorial possessionsfor international guarantees.    Thus in regard to Dalmatia - &quot;The mainland and islands of Dalmatia were asked for and obtained in order to guarantee to Italy the security of her Adriatic coast-line and to avoid the burden of having to defend herself on this sea as v/ell as on the Ionian-Tyrrhenian,    The end was just;   the method was mistaken.    Italy can give up the Dalmatian mainland and islands on condition that the Eastern shore of the Adriatic is neutralised and that, failing general disarmament, the right to maintain fleets and arsenals in the Adriatic be acknowledged as belonging to Italy alone.    And since this right would be illusory unless Italy had some naval base half-way up the Adriatic, she asks for this base in the outlying islands of the Dalmatian archipelago&quot;,.Similarly, if Greece will give up her claia? to Southern Albania, Italy can give up hers to the Dodecanese, Serbia at the same time renouncing Northern Albania on the same grounds of nationality on which she olaims Dalmatia and on whioh Italy should renounce Valoxa.     &quot;But, since the
A3.baniana.are not in a position to defend themselves against the Greeks and the Serbians.., Italy demands that to her, as the nation which has a right to be unhampered in &quot;&quot;the Adriatic, the protec-tion of the whole of Albania should &quot;be entrusted.    Valona will be defended against Greece or anyone else by the Albanians themselves with the help of Italy.&quot;As regards the alleged difference of opinion between the President of Council and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I;1 Idea Mazionale (July 19th) poohpoohs it in not very convincing terms, La Perseveranza (July 17th., D.K. July 31, p.151) which has been consistently anti-Slav, denies it flatly.The karehese de Viti de Marco (h&apos;Unita July 6th, quoted by Corriere della bera July 7th) protests against the sweeping attack made by the New ..,urope (June&apos;20th) on Sonninors foreign policy which, he says, can only be construed as a desire to see him replaced.     &quot;But we,&apos; who have always criticised Son-nino&apos;s foreign policy, have never consented to giving his head on a charger to the Giolittians, Clericals and Socialists,in other words,to the neutralists of all the various shades.     Are v we to be obliged, in order to save our independence, to deny the head of ^onnino to our Allies?    This is the sole consequence, the sole reductio ad absurdum of the Mew Europe!s attempt to intervene in the parliamentary life of Italy&quot;.     While regretting that at the Versailles meeting (of June 3rd) Sonnino, instead of assuming for Italy the lead in anti-Austrian diplomatic action, had allowed her to be taken in tow by the Allies&quot;, the writer urges that this is only a secondary matter;   the Important point
tfabout the declaration was its collective character.     If the Declaration represented a compromise, a &quot;least oommon denomina-tor&quot;e that was rather a consequence of previous Anglo-American attitudes than of Sonnino&apos;s personal prejudices.
