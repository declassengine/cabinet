(See also G ,T i 5076, GyT, 5096 and G.T., 542s&apos;.)5 .96/c .A.S.War46. ;Cabinet iinute 8In submitting the Allocation programme for the Royal Air Force, I.desire to refer&apos;to the Air Ministry&apos;s letter of the 10th July (G.T,, 5096) asking for formal sanction of the main development programme on which this allocation is based.   Approval was &quot;asked for 48 squadrons additional to those sanctioned on the Rothermere programme.   The War Cabinet discussed, the matter almost entirely,from the man-power point of view and decided that &quot;for the immediate present ,  the requirements of the Royal Air Force in personnel should -be arranged from month to month between the Secretary     &apos;/ of State for the Air and the Minister of National Service &quot;,On this occasion, and. at a previous meeting, I indicated that the postponement of the discussion on man-power should not be allowed to hold up all the other concurrent arrangements with, regard to material and training of personnel, and I fully understood that this was accepted, and all arrangements are now in hand, except as regards man-power, for bringing up the total . strength to 34o squadrons.I think it is generally understood that this - -action is being taken, but in order to prevent any misunderstanding, I wish clearly to confirm this &quot;now.II wa5 also 31ated &apos;in the Air Ministry.&apos;s letter that it was expected that the aerodrome.programme already sanctioned would be made to suffice.   1 haveno reason to modify this expectation, but it should be understood that to carry through the expansion a-, considerable amount of extra accommodation at the , aerb $semes Is required and has been put in hand, al so some increase in accommodation for schoolsFinally, I desire to press for the. earliest decision with regard to the allocation of man-power, as if our requirements cannot be met other items of the programme now in hand would require to be cancelled at considerable loss,(Sd.)

ENCLOSURE -I   to G.T.-54S5,COPY1 0?&apos; LOITER NO, B. 96&quot;CvA, S.. DATED 13th AUGUST/ 1916,4Sir,I am commanded &quot;by the&apos;Air Council .to acknowledge receipt of Their Lordships&apos; letter, No. M.0598?) doted   18th July 1918, replying to Air Council letter, No, A.l.u/l2153/l8/F.O,2 61* the 20th June 1918,Since the date of the Air Council, letter quoted, above, the constructional possibilities for the next twelve months have been carefully studied, having regard to the latest figures as regards the delivery of engines from America;   the engine aircraft and equipment output by the Ministry of Munitions; the ground available for aerodromes; the construction possible of sheds, other buildings -and slipways; the possible man-power available for training as pilots, observers and other ranks, and the various other considerations involved in an undertaking of this magnitude&apos;.As a result, the Air Council propose to allocate for the use of the Naval Forces by September 30th 1919, the squadrons shown on the table attached, (Enclosure &quot;A&quot;)   This table should be read in conjunction with Air Ministry letter B,fc&apos;6 C*A*S, of the 13th-August 1918, and its accompanying schedule, from which it will be seen that the Air Council.propose to hold ah unallotted   emergen-cy reserve consisting of 22 squadrons, which will be available to meet emergencies as they arise and will be temporarily allocated at the discretion of the -Council to the Navy, Army or independent Forces in accordance with the exigencies of the air situation as a whole -during&apos;&apos; the coming months.     This reserve will comprise 15 high fighter, squadrons and 7 squadrons Of D.H.9 machines and should be borne- in mind throughout in considering the detailed Statement of proposed changes given in Para, 2, ?2, Their Lordships will observe that the above mentionedtable differs from the statement enclosed in Admiralty letter No. M. 05987 of the.18th -July in certain particulars as exp1airtc d i n d e t ai 1 below,(a)   Dover.- Dunkirk,   One squadron Fighter Reconnaissance . and one Squadron TwiiTEngine Day Bombers omitted.       xIt is hoped that it may bo possible to dispense with these in view of the.American Squadrons which - will be operating f or;- the.- Admiralty in this area. It has boon found possible, however,. to allocate one Sciuadron   of Single Engine Day. Bombers to Dover -Dunkirk which, if not required there, could be diverted to other Admiralty purposes.The Secretary, Admiralty, Whitehall
(b) Bfitish Isles. 27 Aeroplane . Squadrons reduced to 14.Provision has boon made for additional landing grounds which will bo available at short notice in the event of its being found necessary to allocate unite from the unallotted emergency reserve or the Independent Porea to Naval Anti-submarine work, as may happen if the German Submarine policy moots with a greater success than it is hoped will bo possible under the intensive bombardment to which the German Submarine bases and Building Yards will be subjected by the Independent Force.     Further, the Squadrons employed on Anti-submarine work will (except for 3 D.H.9 Squadrons) eventually bo twin-engine machines, capable of carrying a Wireless Operator and an Observer, besides the Pilot, heavy bombs and fuel for a 6 hours patrol.     Both the view and the navigation facilities will ho far superior to those in any existing machines, except the Twin Engine Plying Boats, and with those qualifications, in addition to their higher speed, their attacking power will,&apos;in the aggregate, bo far greater than that of a muoh greater force of aeroplanes of the typo used at present *36&apos; Flying Boat Squadrons reduced to SO.Tho shed,and slipway accommodation for these craft will only accommodate a maximum of 100 boats and it will be necessary to provide Pocking lighters and Moorings for at least .40 boats to accommodate the whole of the 20 squadrons.     In addition to this, Docking Lighters and Moorings must be provided at practically all the Stations for a certain proportion of. the boats operating to enable them to get away quickly when required, and because the accommodation is computed on a basis of close packing within the sheds, leaving no additional room for repair work.In addition to the  0 squadrons, of Flying Boats, however, it will bo possible to provide 3^- squadrons of small Seaplanes over and above the numbers asked for by the Admiralty..     This has the further advantage of allowing for Seaplanes to be carried by Merchant Ships on convoy, if this system proves successful.(e) Hoditerranean*   10 Squadrons of Plying Boats reduced to 8cQuestions of transport, accommodation and repair facilities, render the maintenance of oven 8&quot; squadrons ox Plying Boats in the Mediterranean difficult.4 Squadrons of small Seanlanes reduced to 3If desired, one of the Squadrons of small Seaplanes allocated to British Waters, could bo sent to the Llediterranean.     It is hoped, however, that the introduction of Aeroplanes for Anti-Submarine work in the vicinity of Port Said, combined with the re-distribution of the 3 squadrons already allowed, will render the latter number sufficient.
4 gSquadr or:s of sin ?lo- en atne ay^ 1101.1 oc r s^ sub01 i tutvd for&apos; 4\twijr. eJTpne0quadrons^it is re.,ret tod that considerations of supply and the general air situation render this substitution inevitable.NOTE, As affecting the anti-submarine campaign it is possibleTo arrange for a large increase in the number of working Kite Balloons at a comparatively, small coat in man-power.   It io Suggested that the increased use of Kite Balloons for Convoy and other purely defensive work, will assist to relieve the work of the heavier thai? air craft.W Grand FleetLAs regards the provision of aircraft to be Used from ships of the Grand Fleet, the Air Council recognise the importance of making an ample provision for an increase in the development in the art of flying from and possibly alighting on ship3.   More-over,  experience up to the present does not provide a sufficient basis to estimate possible wastage in either machines:or personnel, with any great accuracy. The machines to be used will be to some extent&apos; of special types and consequently it will not be possible to reinforce the Fleet Units in such cases by diver-si on from other Services,For these reasons the Air Council are arranging to allocate a permanent establishment of 100 per cent of spare machines and 20 per cent of spare pilots to all squadrons allocated for this.service.   The spare machines should suffice to meet any sudden demand which would result, for example, from a Fleet action or from the discovery or adr.ptfttlafof some improved facility for carrying new machines in warships, and will be in addition to the machines regularly supplied on a wastage rate computed from past experience.   The 20 per cent of spare pilots will form a convenient pool to allow for short training periods and refresher courses, and in addition to these, provision&apos;is being made for the supply of pilots at a normal wastage rate.It is considered that 5 squadrons cf High-        1 Fighters instead of 8 will be sufficient in view cf the foregoing considerations, and of the fact that the High Fighters to be used will be essentially similar to those in use on shore so that in case of emergency these squadrons could be supplemented from the unallotted res., rve.   On the other hand it is proposed to provide a total of 6 instead of 5 squadrons for Artillery and Fighter Reconnaissance work, the same type of machine being used for both services.( e) Unclassified Torpedo Aeroplanes.Information is desired as tc where Their lordships wish to use these squadrons.,   provisional arrangements are b\ ing made to train three to operate from ships and four from shore bases.3,     In sum,  the allotment of squadrons as approved by the Air Council allows of an increase of 33-1/6 squadrons on the present strength&apos;of 61-5/6 ( as at July 8th 1918).
The Air Council much regret that, owirr; to the demands made by the never-:,1 branches of the service, it is impossible to carry out the entire programme put forward by the Admiralty.   Should the Admiralty contemplate any re-arrangement of the programme ay nbv amended I aia to request that thu Air Council may be informed at the earliest possible date in order that the questions concerning training, landing ground, and the supply of equipment etc., -may be simplified.4.       I am further to inform you that the dates for the completion of the various units on this programme are based upon a conservative estimate of engine deli varies. . Should these deliveries improve it is hoped to anticipate the dates for completion.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,^Sde)    W.A, ROBINSON.

gljCLQBURJ II TO G.T.-5425. &apos;COPY 03? LETTER HO, E.96 C.A.S. DATED 1STH AUGUST, 1918 FROK SECRETARY, AIlTfliJISTRY, TO SLCRTTARY, WAR OFFICE.Sir,With referonce to War Office letter, No. 57/Aircraft/l (h.0,4.) dated July 27th, 1918, in reply to Air Ministry letter No, B./96/C,A,S.,dated June 20th, 1918, I am commanded by the Air Council to submit, for the information of the Army Council, the number of Squadrons it is considered that it will be possible to provide to co-operate with the Armies in all theatres of war, due regard having been paid to the question of man-power and the probable output of material This amended programme is summarised in Table &quot;A&quot; attached,.2, This table should be read in conjunction with AirMinistry letter No, B./96/C.A.S. of the 13th August, 1918 and its accompanying schedule, of which copies arc attached, from &apos; which it v/ill be seen that the Air Council propose to hold an unallotted emergency reserve consisting of 22 Squadrons,   This reserve will comprise 15 Squadrons of high lighters and 7 of D.H.9, machines, and will be available to meet emergencies as they arise;    it will be temporarily allocated at the discretion of the Air Council to the Army, Navy or Independent Forces in accordance with the exigencies of the air situation during the coming months.   Accordingly, its existence should be borne in mind throughout, in considering the detailed discussion of the programme as affecting the different theatres of operations which v/ill be found in Paragraph 2, particularly in regard to the demand for single-seater and long-distance fighting and day bombing Squadrons on the Western Front,3, It is proposed to deal with each theatre of operationsseparately.(a)      As regards France :(i) It is agreed that 4 Squadrons will be required for co-operation with long-range guns, but these Squadrons will have to be equipped with Bristol Fighters in the first instance and gradual replacements made by three-seat er machines, as these become available and can be spared.   It is further agreed that 14 Squadrons v/ill be required to co-operate with the 14 Corps.(ii) Seven two-seater fighter reoonnaissance Squadrons can be supplied,(iii) With regard to single-seater fighter Squadrons, it is noted that the Army Council desire that there should be 15 low and 40 ordinary single-seater high fighters, by   the end of September, 1919,Tho Air Council agree to the number of low fighter Squadrons but regret that it is only possible definitely to provide 35 high fighter Squadrons, in   &quot; view of the air situation as a whole and the universal demand for this type of machine.   The possibility of allocating the balance from the unallotted reserve v/ill, however, be considered,ecrctary. War Office,Whitehall,    S.YM,
n 9 * (0As regards the 5 night fighting Squadrons asked for, the Air Council contemplate the provision of 20 night fighting Squadrons to cover in this regard tho requirements of Homo Defence, Ireland and night fighting in Franco, and will agree to any allocation of theso Squadrons which the Army Council may put forward.As regards the 4 Squadrons of long-distance fighters, it is regretted that there is no type in production which fulfils this requirement; the type is, however, being taken up experimentally.   It is at the same time to be doubted whether 4 Squadrons will bo available to this end, though the Air Council will bo prepared to consider the temporary allocation of 4 Squadrons of D.H.9 machines from tho unallotted reserve above-mentioned, should the situation elsewhere admit.   In this connection, I am to say that, in the opinion of the Air Council, the best method of coping with enemy opposition to our long-distance bombing is to Increase the strength of formations rather than to attempt the provision of fighting escorts.(iv) Day Bombers :   With reference to the 3 additional Squadrons of day bombers requested, it Is regretted that these cannot be provided unless from the unallotted reserve.   In any case their provision must, as In tho case of the preceding, depend on the general aircraft&apos; position in the future.(v) Might Bombers ;   The Air Council regret that, in view of the urgont demands elsewhere for this type of machine, they must adhere to their original allotment of 10 Squadrons.   It is intended, however, that all these Squadrons should eventually consist of twin--engine machines;each of these Squadrons will have approximately twice the range and four times the lifting power of a F.E, Squadron.   (The two Handlcy Page Squadrons now in Franco were lent temporarilyj in Air Ministry letter No.&quot; B.2900 (F.0.1.) dated 2nd August, 1918, it has been requested that the &quot;Army Council will arrange for one of them, No.215, to be sent to tho Independent Force on the 15th August,-);(-b)   Palestine;   As regards the allotment of Squadrons Tov^Xoolim, the Air Coucil -regret that, they eannct provide more than 9 Squadrons.   It is proposed that these should be allotted as follows- 3 Corps Reconnaissance *   V :: &quot;. 2 Two-Seator Fighter-Reconnaissance.2. Single-Scater Fighters.2 Day Bombers.(o)   I With reference to Salonika, Mesopotamia,India and Aden, the proposals suggested by the Amy Council will be complied with.(d). With regard t0 Italy, the situation willremain a3 it is at present, which fulfils the suggested requirement, excopt in so far as a Hsndlcy Pago Squadron is concerned, which it is regretUid cannot bo provided.&apos; &apos;\
4.     Swnmarising ;        The allotment of Squadrons as approved by the Air&quot; Council allows for an increase of    t?7.l/6th Squadrons on the strength as at July 8th, 1918.The Air Council much regret that, -owing to demands made by the several branches of the Services, it is impossible to carry out the entire programme as put forward by the Army Council;   they have no objection, however, to Squadrons of similar types being re-allotted by the Army Council from one theatre of operations to another, if it is considered that by so doing they would be more suitably allocated tc meet anticipated requirements.I am commanded to request that, in the ovent of such a re-allotment being considered, the Air Council may be informed at the earliest possible date, in order that questions concerning the supply of equipment etc.   may be simplified.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sd. ) \7.A.
