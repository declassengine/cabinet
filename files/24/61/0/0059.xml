The course I would recommend for the consideration of the War Cabinet is that copies of all Papers, other than those of purely domestic interest in the United Kingdom, excepting Papers of extreme secrecy, the oir-culation of which is usually confined within the narrowest possible limits,.should be sent to the representative Ministers on the Imperial 7ar Cabinet in London, and that they should be asked to select those Papers which they consider, should be sent to the Prime Minister of their Dominion. To illustrate how this would work in practice, all Papers, other than the two categories mentioned, would be sent to Sir E. Kemp, and he would be asked to notify me of those which he thinks&quot;should go to Sir Robert Borden.I v/ould propose to meet the case of those Dominions who have no nominated representative Minister by detailing an Officer in my Office to submit to me the list of Papers to be sent,&apos;A further question arises in this connection.   Should the resident or&apos;visiting Ministers in London receive copies of the foreign Office and n/ar Office telegrams which have, during the last few weeks been sent to the Prime Ministers of the Dominions in London ?    This is a matter which concerns the Foreign Office and War Offloe rather than this Office, but it is&quot;so closely conneoted with the general question that I venture to raise it in.this Note.(Signed). h,P.A.HAMEY.   .Secretary.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I. August 30th, 1918.
MOLOSTOS   TO   G,1,-5458,Offices of the War Cabinet, 2, Whitehall Gardens,   S.W,16th August, 1918,Dear Mr. Lloyd George,It Beans very desirable that some arrangement should be made whereby, during the interval between the sessions of the imperial War Cabinet, important papers which are circulated throughout the year to the Kembers of the British War Cabinet could bo sent out to the Dominions for the information of the Dominion members, It is an almost impossible task on our arrival here to give careful attention to the mass of documents which we find confronting us,   Some of the papers could doubtless be sent out in the regular bag which goes from here to Ottawa; as to others, it would probably be necessary tc arrange for a special messenger service,   This, I should think, would not be difficult.Por myself, I should like to see all the important papers, and especially, perhaps, those relating to the United States of America, her forces and her war effort generally, the Siberian Expedition and Russia generally, and the League of Nations.     I do not, however, in mentioning these special matters wish to be understood as in any sense excluding other subjects.The arrangement would seem to be a natural consequence of the decision recently reached in the Imperial War Cabinet.Yours faithfully,(Sd.) B.L. BOREEN.
