CONFIDENTIAL. i      Political Intelligence Department.[August 12, 1918.] Foreign Office,Rumania /OOP5MEMORANDUMonTHE BESSARABIAN QUESTION AND THE ACT OF UNION WITHRUMANIA.FOR the first time in forty years the Bessarabian question has again become one of international importance. The fact that, whether in theory recognised or not. the union which has been brought about between Bessarabia and Rumania is an accomplished fact and regarded as such not only by the Central Powers but by the majority of Rumanians themselves, means that the Great Powers will have seriously to deal with this question, so important to the relations of Russia and Rumania and the surrounding countries, at the Peace Conference, or possibly before. For this reason it has appeared advisable to collect such data as are obtainable with regard to the union of Bessarabia with Rumania and the occurrences which preceded and followed it.The History of. the Bessarabian Question.To Rumanians Bessarabia is an integral part of their historic heritage. Southern Bessarabia was loosely connected with Wallachia at the end of the 13th and beginning of the 14th century, and shared with it the name which it has now exclusively appropriated of Basarabia, the country of the Basarab princes who then ruled Wallachia. In the 14th century it gradually passed under the sway of Moldavia, and the preponderant elements in the province are mainly Moldavian by race, dialect, and history. The occupation by the Turks at the beginning of the 16th century of Southern Bessarabia, which they converted into the two Sanjaks of Akkermanand Ismail, was the first step in the de-liumanisation of this part of the province since known as the Bujak which in the centuries that followed was repeatedly swept by Cossack, Turkish, and Russian invasions, and subsequently colonised by religious refugees from Russia, political refugees from Bulgaria, and German and Jewish elements settled there during thel9th century. The rest of Bessarabia, however, with the exception of the extreme north, remained preponderantly Rumanian in character. In 1812 by the first Treaty of Bucarest the Tsar Alexander I succeeded in securing the annexation of Bessarabia, to Russia under whose rule the greater part of it remained for 105 years. The only modification of the treaty was that effected by the Treaty of Paris in 1856, imposed on Russia by the victorious allies. Article 20 secured the return to Moldavia of a great part of the Bujak paradoxically enough the least Paunanian part of the province including roughly all the territory to the south of a line drawn from Akkerinan to Bolyrad and from Bolo-rad to Catamori on the Prut.. But the three Bessarabian departments thus restored were lost to Rumania twenty-two years dater by the Treaty of Berlin, when the Russian Government succeeded in securing the consent of the Powers to the return&apos; of this territory to Russia. The fact that Rumania was compensated with the undeveloped and waste province of Dohrogea did not reconcile Rumanians to this act of spoliation, which confirmed them in their antagonism to Russia, the foundations of which rested on Russians autocratic treatment of Rumania in the past and the first seizure of Bessarabia in 1812. The question of Bessarabia was not forgotten by any Roumanian, and this Rumanian grievance has been cleverly exploited ever since by German propagandists in turning Poimania against Russia,Racial and Political Conditions in Bessarabia.Historically, then, Bessarabia is Rumanian. In fact, there is practically no difference between the Bessarabian Rumanians and the population of neighbouring Moldavia, and the Bessarabians have no other name for themselves in common use- but &quot; Moldavians.&quot; Adequate statistics of the racial elements in the population estimated in 19)3 at 2,588,400 are unfortunately lacking.    Under the old regime Russian[367-34] B
propagandists commonly put the Rumanian percentage at only 48. This is strongly disputed by Rumanians. In. 1891 Russian statistical returns gave 1,089,995 Moldavians out of a total population of 1,041,559 that is to say, a percentage of about 66. The next most numerous nationalities, Ukrainians and Jews, were at the same time stated as 13&apos;6 and 9 per cent, of the population respectively. Presuming, then, that the same proportions have been since maintained, the number of Rumanians and Ukrainians respectively in 1913 would have been 1,725,600 and 349,380. In the central parts of the province the Rumanian proportion must be much higher, for Ukrainians are chiefly to be found in the northernmost department of Khotin, where they live in compaqt masses, and dispersed throughout the Bujak. Moreover, the Bessarabian Rumanians are almost entirely peasants, and therefore less subject to emigration than the more fluctuating population of the towns.By the Treaty of 1812 Russia assured the province of special conditions. As a temporary favour the population was promised exemption from military service and freedom from taxation for three years. It was allowed at first a Governor of Rumanian race, whose capital was at Chisinau (Kishinyov). The Church of the province was to be under a special Exarch nominated by the Holy Synod. These special privileges were soon withdrawn, and for a century a policy of complete Russification was adopted by the Russian authorities. The Rumanian language was proscribed in the Administration, Church, press, and schools, and the only means of advancement for the population -was through the. study of Russian. This policy had some success with the land-owning classes, the boyars, many of whom learnt to identify themselves with Russian reac-tionaries of their own class, but the peasant majority remained almost untouched. Unable to write or.read, and out of contact with the administration and with commerce, they went on with their old life, preserving their language and national customs. With them the Government had little reason actively to interfere, its attention being principally directed to the suppression of any nationalist movement among the Intelli-gentsia. From 1905 there was a slight relaxation of this regime of oppression, newspapers being allowed to appear in the Rumanian language, but only in Cyrillic script, while some degree of nominal local autonomy had been provided by the creation of the Zyemstvo in 1871. Nationalist agitation was confined to a few intellectuals like Constantin Stere, who associated himself with the 1905 Revolution, and was in consequence exiled to Siberia, whence after some years he escaped, carrying back to Rumania the bitterest feeling of antagonism to the Russian Government.The Events of miThe freedom of speech and action which the Revolution of March 1917 brought to all the peoples, Russian and non-Russian, of the Empire was soon felt in Bessarabia. By the end of May the National Moldavian Committee had been established, and a congress was held at Chisinau, which decided to demand autonomy and full recognition of the Moldavian language. The programme of the Moldavian Committee was at first a moderate one. During the early summer they contented themselves with asking for administrative and ecclesiastical autonomy; the use of the Rumanian language ; a fairer distribution of land among the Moldavian peasants; the right of Bessarabians to do their military service in Bessarabia and to form local military units; expenditure on the province of revenue raised there ; and the assurance of reciprocal religious, political, and economic rights for Bessarabians out of Bessarabia with those granted to non-Moldavians in Bessarabia. The Committee at the time showed no inclination towards union with Rumania. The Rumanian Parliament had not yet passed the sweeping measures of agrarian and electoral reform which it enacted in July, and Bessarabian reformers saw at the time more hope of securing a free and progressive development of the province as part of a Federal Russian Republic than as part of an undemocratised Rumania.Active educational work was at once undertaken. On the 4th June, 1917, the first Moldavian Peopled Library was opened in Chisinau, and schools for Moldavian children, in which the Rumanian language and Latin alphabet were used, were founded in the towns and villages of Bessarabia, By the end of August, 350 out of 418 candidates for teacherships had passed a test examination in Romanian language and history. Rumanian papers in Latin script began to appear, chief amoug them being the &quot; Cuvant Moldovenesc&quot; (&quot; The Moldavian Word &quot;). At the same time, the Moldavian Committee called on its fellow-citizens to defend their newly-won liberties against the Central Powers, and secured from General Shcherbachev permission for the formation of a reserve force of 40,000 Bessarabian-Moldavians under their own officers.
Early in August a territorial difficulty arose with the Ukraine. The Ukrainian Rada declared that Bessarabia fell within the frontiers of the new Ukrainian State. The Bessarabian Committee indignantly protested, and sent a deputation to Kiyev to point out that the Ukrainian demand infringed the principle of self-determination. The Rada finally gave way, and admitted that Bessarabia did not fall within the frontiers of the Ukraine a point of view which it subsequently confirmed on the 15th January, 1918, then went back on, and has only the other day once again admitted.&apos;&quot;&quot;Steps towards Independence.The Moldavian Committees original hope of finding a proper place in a reformed Russian Federal State broke down with the advent of the Bolsheviks to power. The latter showed themselves even more intransigeant towards the Bessarabian Committee than towards other Nationalist Governments in the Russian Empire. They denied that the Committee represented the true Bessarabia or the oppressed proletariat. TheCom-mittee were forced by this action to take more decisive steps. Un the 3rd November, 500 representatives of the population of Bessarabia met in Chisinau and declared for Bessarabian autonomy. On the 8th December a new &quot; Council of the Land &quot; (&quot; Sfatul Tarii&quot;), composed of representatives of all sections of the population of the province, was opened in Chisinau. There seem originally to have been 147 delegates; of these, 105 were Moldavians, 1.5 Ukrainians, 13 Jews, 5 Bulgars, and the rest representatives of the other nationalities. The character and credentials of these delegates must be discussed later, but a study of their names shows most certainly that the bulk of them are what they pretended to be, soldiers and peasants.The chief part in organising the administration and modelling the constitution was, however, played by a few intellectuals, among them the Moldavian tnculet, Professor at Petrograd University, loan Pelivan, and Octaviaii Ghibu. M. Stere, a still more important person, was of course absent, as he had preferred to go to Bucarest when it passed under German military occupation. On the loth December the Council of the Land proclaimed an independent Moldavian Bepublic, but even so, no final breach with Russia was decided on, for at a meeting of the Council on the 19th December a message was read from the representative of the Sovyet Government &quot; saluting the Moldavian Republic and the Council of the Land .... in which it sees the basis of a Federal Republic.&quot;It was becoming clear, however, to Bessarabians that in the midst of the chaos prevailing in Russia, and especially in the Ukraine, it was necessary for them to take their administration entirely into their own hands. The Council of the Land elected on the 29th December its own Cabinet with M. Erhan as President and eight Directors-General, most important of whom were Pelivan (already mentioned) for International Affairs, and loncu for Finance. The programme of the Government of the new republic has an entirely democratic ring. According to the plan drawn up by the administrative commission appointed, the Council of the Land pledges itself to the election of &quot; a constituent assembly of the Moldavian Republic on the basis of universal, equal, direct, secret, and proportional suffrage.&quot; Clause 2 provides that &quot; all the land is to pass into the hands of the peasants without compensation to the landlords.&quot; Until such time as this law can be applied, democratic committees will be entrusted with the control of the lands. Clause 3 assures the population that &quot; food and articles of primary necessity will be State-controlled and equally distributed,&quot; while the State will regulate employ-ment, introduce workmen&apos;s insurance, and an eight hours&apos; day, and generally control all oroduction and incomes. Other clauses pledge the Council to organise elections on the Dasis of universal equal suffrage for the local communes; to assure liberty of the press, belief, associations, and individuals; to abolish the death penalty; to maintain the equality of all nationalities on Moldavian territory ; to spread schools and preserve their national character for all the different nationalities; to organise national armies immediately for the defence of the province and prevention of anarchy; and, finally (clause 10), to &quot;work for a peace Avithout annexations and indemnities on the principle of full self-determination of peoples in agreement with the Allies and all the peoples of the Russian Federal Republic.&quot;The Rumano-Bolshevih War.The new Moldavian Republic was not, however, long left to itself. Early in Januaryf the authority of the Council was being questioned and undermined by the spread of* According to a Copenhagen report from Berlin (&apos;* Westminster Gazette,&quot; 31st July), t Account given in the Odessa &quot; Vestitorul,&quot; 2nd/loth January.
Bolshevik or anarchistic ideas, The small forces under the control of the Council were quite unable to cope with these disorders, which were fomented by the Bolshevik Government, whose point of view was that the Council was nationalist and bourgeois in character. The Bolshevik Government in Petrograd, through the soi-clisant Collegium under the presidency of the notorious Bolshevik agitator Bakovski, did what it could to help on the chances of Bolshevik revolution in Bessarabia, Russian armies retiring from the Rumanian front in disorder were ranging&apos; the province, and there was serious danger of the food depots, which the Rumanian Government had set up there, being seized and pillaged. In these circumstances the Council of the Land appealed to the Rumanian Government to send troops into the province to maintain order. M. Bratianu, with characteristic prudence, had hitherto hesitated to do this, but he now, with the approval of the Allied Powers, despatched certain divisions to Bessarabia with the announced intention of guarding life and property, This provided the Bolshevik Government with a further grievance against Rumania, and on the 29th January they declared war on Rumania and handed his passports to the Rumanian Minister in Petrograd. The declaration of war, however, remained merely a paper one,* since on the 9th February the representatives of the Rada at Brest-Litovsk concluded peace between the Ukraine and the Central Powers, who soon proceeded to send troops into the Ukraine, thereby separating Bessarabia and Rumania from Great Russia. This placed the Bessarabian Government internationally in a radically changed position, and they had consequently to make up their minds as to what their next orientation should be.The Coming of Union.On the 5th March the Rumanian delegates at Buftea signed the preliminary treaty of peace with the Central Powers, providing in principle for the conditions afterwards imposed in detail by the definite Treaty of Bucarest on the 7th. May. By clause 5 of this preliminary treaty the Rumanian Government is allowed to keep such forces in Bessarabia as are required to maintain security on the Russo-Rumanian frontier. These forces, all told, amounted to some 20,000 men. No mention is made either in this preliminary treaty or in the Treaty of Bucarest of the final assignment of Bessarabia to Rumania. There seems little doubt, however, that the subject had been at least informally discussed between the Rumanian and German Governments, and that General Averescu (who, after a month in ofnce, was succeeded by M. Marghiloman on the 14th March) and M. Marghiloman had both received some sort of understanding! from the Germans that their good offices might be relied on to secure the recovery of Bessarabia by Rumania. The object of the Germans was both to draw the Rumanian authorities into a readier acceptance of a ruthless peace by the promise of compensations elsewhere, and definitely to estrange Rumania from Russia. Above all, the Germans hoped by securing by force the union of Bessarabia with Rumania that they would make the Rumanian Government still more dependent for the retention of the province on German support. With characteristic duplicity they at the same time encouraged their proteges, the Ukrainian Government, to oppose this union.The question of the union, however, transcended any diplomatic deal between the German and Germanophil-Rumanian Government.The decision in the last instance depended on the Bessarabian Council itself. Its constitution has already been described. Of the 147 members elected in November, 105 were &quot; Moldavians,&quot; mostly representatives either of the soldiers&apos; committees or of the local peasants&apos; associations. Some 70^1 of these had by April formed themselves into a &quot;Moldavian Bloc,&quot; and possessed a bare majority of the total number of 1301 deputies who actually took part in the sittings of the &quot; Council of the Land.&quot; This Moldavian Bloc put the national issue above the economic. It was otherwise with the Peasants Fraction, which, though mainly composed of &quot; Moldavian&quot; peasants, obviously considered the land question far more vital than any national or cultural one. The Nationalities Bloc, lastly, included the delegates of the various small groups of racial minorities Ukrainians, Jews, Russians, Bulgars, Germans, and Poles. As has been described above, the Moldavian Bloc had come to see the necessity for an immediate decision as to its relations with Rumania. On the 9th February7 the delegates of the Rada signed their peace treaty with the Central Powers.   On the 1st March Austro-* II. is not yet certain that peace has ever been signed.I On June 26 General Averescu interpellated ihe Marghiloman Government &quot;to state what connection there had been between the peace negotiations of Bucarest and the incorporation of Bessarabia in Rumania.&quot; The Government appear to have answered evasively.   (&quot; Lumina,&quot; June 27.)I Article by D. D. Piitrascauu in the Bucarest &quot; Lumina&quot; (May 5). &quot; Lumina&quot; (April 14), however, states that there are 140 deputies in the Council.
-0German forces entered Kiyev ; on the 10th March Odessa fell, Bessarabia was thus surrounded on almost all sides by the Germanic armies; only to the south-west was there a friendly country from which overtures with a view to union were being made. It was obvious that Bessarabia, united with Rumania, would at least stand a better chance of more respectful treatment from the Germans than Bessarabia isolated. Consequently, the Moldavian Bloc did not hesitate to make up its mind to union. But, on the other hand, there was no wish for &quot; annexation &quot; ; union must be on Bessarabia&apos;s own terms. There was considerable suspicion of the reactionary character and designs of the new ultra-Conservative Marghiloman Government. Moreover, the Rumanian troops in Bessarabia had not been careful enough of the susceptibilities of the population. Though the &quot; entry into the country, at the request of the Council of the Land, of the armies of our Rumanian brethren, had brought about the establishment of relative order there,&quot;&apos;15 yet &quot; they behaved as though in a conquered country. Measures have been taken and officers guilty of serious offences punished.&quot;f An order issued I by General Brosteanu, commanding the 10th Division, warns his officers &quot;to behave as well and civilly as possible to the Jews,&quot; and &quot; on all occasions in towns, in the villages, and in trains to treat all the civilian population, of whatever nationality, in a polite, civilised, and agreeable manner, not with contempt, hostility, roughness, or ridicule.&quot; So they will &quot; win their sympathies&quot; ; otherwise they will &quot; incur their hate.&quot; Most of these incidents probably took place with the non-Ruman population. There are Jewish complaints, jj but not very convincing, of&quot; pogroms&quot; ; the Jewish population were accused of pro-Germanism. But even the native Moldavians had their fears, and therefore drew up their terms for acceptance by Marghiloman before pledging themselves to vote for union.   These terms, as accepted, were : &quot; The Moldavian Democratic Republic (Bessarabia), within its boundaries the Prut, Dnyestr, Danube, Black Sea, and the old frontiers with Austria, torn away by Russia over a century ago from the body of old Moldavia, in virtue of historic and racial right, on the basis of the principle that nations alone shall determine their own destiny, henceforward and for ever unites itself with Rumania, its mother.&quot; This union is made on the following bases : &quot; 1. The present Council of the Land (&apos; Sfatul Tarii&apos;) continues in power in order to resolve and realise agrarian reform in accordance with the needs and demands of the nation. These decisions will be recognised by the Rumanian Government,&quot; 2. Bessarabia preserves its provincial autonomy, having a Council of the Land (Diet), elected in future by means of universal, equal, direct, and secret suffrage, with an executive organ and administrations of its own.&quot; 3, The Council of the Land is competent to &quot; (a) vote the local budgets ;&quot; (&amp;) control all the organs of the Zyemstva and towns;&quot; (c) nominate all functionaries of the local administration throughits executive organ, while the high functionaries are confirmedby the Government.&quot; 4. The army will be recruited on the territorial principle.&quot; 5. The laws now obtaining and the local organisation (Zyemstva and towns) remain in force and can only he changed by the Rumanian Parliament after representatives of Bessarabia shall take part in its labours.&quot; 6. Respect of the rights of the&apos; minorities of Bessarabia, &quot; 7. Two representatives of Bessarabia will enter the Rumanian Council of Ministers.   For this once they will be appointed by the present Council of the Land, but in future taken from among the repre-sentatives of Bessarabia in the Rumanian Parliament.* Declaration of the Council of Directors in the Council of the Land on April 11 (&quot;Luraina,&quot; May 4). t M. luculetj Bessarabian Minister in the Rumanian Government, interviewed bv &quot; Luniina&quot; (May 31). j &quot;Lumina&quot; (April U).I An obviously exaggerated account but very possibly based on certain actual facts of outrages committed by the orders of two Rumanian officers on some Jews in the town of Yedintsy (department, Khotin) has been published as &quot; The Roumanian Reign of Terror in Bessarabia (The Account of an Eye-witness) &quot; as supplement to No. 70 of the &quot; Bulletins of the Copenhagen Office of the Zionist Organisation.&quot;[367-34] C
g&quot; 8. Bessarabia will send to the Rumanian Parliament a number of repre-sentatives in proportion to the population, elected on the basis of universal, equal, direct, and secret suffrage.&quot;9. All elections in Bessarabia for cantonal (volosti), village, and town councils, for the Zyemstva, and for Parliament, shall be made on the basis of universal, equal, direct, and secret suffrage.&quot;10. Personal liberty, liberty of the press, of speech, of belief, of assembly, and all communal liberties will be guaranteed by the Constitution.&quot;11. All infringements of laws made for political reasons during the troubled times which have passed are amnestied.&quot; As Bessarabia is uniting herself as a daughter with her mother Rumania, the Rumanian. Parliament will decide on the convocation without delay of the Constituent in which, proportionately to its population, there will take part representatives of Bessarabia, elected by universal, equal, direct, and secret suffrage, to determine, together with them all, the insertion in the Constitution of the principles and guarantees aforementioned.&quot; Long live the union of Bessarabia with Rumania for all time !&quot; Accepted in the Council of the Land on the 27th March, 1918, Chisinau.&apos;   - (Signed)        &quot; I. Inculet&quot; [President of the Council of the Land).&quot; I. brjzdugan&quot; (Secretary of the Council of the Land,).&quot;These were the terms which the Moldavian Bloc considered an indispensable preliminary to acceptance of union with Rumania. The distrust of other members of the Council had yet to be overcome. Above all, it was necessary to win to the cause of union members of the Peasants party (already described). This was the work of M. Stere, and no one but he could have done it. Himself an intensely patriotic Pan-Rumanian, he also enjoys the reputation of being a sincere social reformer, even a Socialist in outlook. On the 24th March he arrived in Chisinau and was cordially welcomed as a life-long champion of the Bessarabian cause. Within three days he had made thirty-five speeches in favour of the cause of union, and his enthusiasm was rewarded by his being elected honoris causa deputy for Soroca, and subsequently president of the Council of the Land.At the critical sitting of the Council held on the 8th April, M. Stere turned the scale in favour of union. He pointed out that this was a unique moment in the history of Bessarabia, alike for the Rumanian and for the other nationalities of the country. For Bessarabiau-Rumanians there could be no alternative to union with the mother-country. The non-Ruinan nationalities might announce their intention of leaving the country if union with Rumania were voted. They might find a congeuial place of refuge in other lands, but where could the Rumanians go ? &quot; There is nowhere for us to fly, and no one can chase us from our home.&quot; To the other nationalities he appealed on the ground that the great majority of the population was Ruman, and, whether the other nationalities willed it or not, union with Rumania was curtain. It rested with them to throw in their lot whole-heartedly with their fellow-Bessarabians. M. Stere&apos;s appeal to the other nationalities, however, met with no success. In turn, the representatives of the German, Bulgar, Ukrainian, and Russian groups declared that they had no mandate to discuss the question. The Jewish representative refrained from any declaration. The decisive voice, therefore, rested with the peasants&apos; party, and in this two opinions prevailed. The &quot; Labour fraction&quot; of the party took the standpoint of the national minorities; another fraction demanded union. An interval of fifteen minutes was allowed tor consultation on the point, and subsequently the motion for union was put to an open vote, with the result that 86 votes were given for union, 3 against, and 36 abstentions, while 13 of the 138 deputies were absent. Amidst prolonged applause, union with Rumania was therefore carried. M. Marghiloman, the Baimanian Prime Minister, who had come down to be present at the meeting, was then admitted, and on behalf of his Government cordially accepted the act of union, declaring, &quot;I have taken cognisance of your declaration, and, in the name of my Government, I accept it.   Long live Rumania, one and undivided !&quot;The announcement of the union was received with jubilation in Iasi, where a triumphant demonstration was held, followed by a solemn Te Deum.* In this demonstra-* A thanksgiving service was also held by the Jews in the chief synagogue.  (&quot; Lumina,&quot; May 2).
fi 0tion membersjof various parties, including that of the former Liberal Government, took part, the only absentees being M. Take lonescu and members of his party, who were presumably unwilling to give even an indirect approval to what they considered the policy of the Marghiloman Government. In fact, the two very different sides to this question must be kept distinct. It is true that Marghiloman hastened to claim the union of Bessarabia with Rumania as his own achievement.   In a public speech whichhe made lie declared : &quot; Yes, we are losing Dobrogea.....The responsibility for thisis not mine ; but as a soothing balsam for this we have given Rumania Bessarabia. This is my action.&quot; Curiously enough, his colleague, M. Arion, was wise enough to avoid any statement that the acquisition of Bessarabia was even indirectly connected with the loss of Dobrogea. &quot; Bessarabia,&quot; he said on the 8th May, &quot; has not returned to us as a compensation for our sufferings and our territorial diminution, but as our right, which has triumphed, thanks to the energy of the race, which has remained so Rumanian in spite of all the efforts of the Russians for a century and more.&quot;The Bessarabian standpoint is not that of Marghiloman. As we have seen, in the last resort the union depended not on the action of the Marghiloman Government, but on the free choice of the Bessarabians. Union they accepted on their own terms and on the assurances of M. Stere, whom they trusted. Nor have they any intention of putting themselves under the control of the landed oligarchy now in command of Rumania proper. Their attitude is just the contrary. The programme of M. Stere and his Bessarabian supporters is a clearly defined democratic one. They consider not that Rumania has annexed Bessarabia, but that Bessarabia in a sense is to control Rumania; that is to say, that the democratic programme to which the Bessarabian Government has committed itself shall serve as a model for the future reconstruction of Rumania. &quot;A full union of souls can come about only when the whole Rumanian people, together with its leaders, shall share the democratic ideals by which, thanks to the revolution, the Bessarabian nation is permeated, since the nation cannot return from light to darkness.^ M. Stere is an advocate in Rumania proper of universal suffrage, expropria-tion of the big landed proprietors, a fair solution of the Jewish question, and sweeping measures of administrative decentralisation. On all these matters he hopes that Bessarabia will serve as a model to Rumanian statesmen. Bessarabians, following M. Stere, demand that as soon as the newly elected Rumanian Parliament shall have settled the urgent question of the ratification of the Peace Treaty, it shall be at once dissolved and a constituent assembly elected for the whole of Bessarabia and Rumania, to deal with the urgently needed question of reform. Two Bessarabian Ministers, MM. Inculet and Ciuhureanu, are, in accordance with the terms of union, taking part in the deliberations of the Rumanian Cabinet, and in interviews they have given they proclaim a whole-hearted democratic policy, universal suffrage, and land for the peasants. As to the details of the agrarian reforms, they are not perfectly clear. They obviously realise the difficulty of the complete expropriation without compensation., which had at first been promised. The standpoint taken up now by these Ministers is that the peasants are quite able to work the land, but that progress in this direction must be gradual, As much land must be handed over to the peasants as they shall themselves be able to work, while a great proprietor must similarly be left with as much as he proves able to develop. In the meantime land committees, consisting of five peasants, a representative of the big proprietors, and an adjudicator are appointed to deal with the question. All this is very well in theory. The really interesting-question is how far the Council of the Land is sincere, as it certainly appears to be, in working for an impartial solution of this urgent question. How far does it represent the wishes of the majority of the population ? This we do not know. What is perfectly clear is that it certainly does not accept the reactionary standpoint of the Marghiloman Go v eminent.&apos; Since the elections at the beginning of June, M. Stere has continuously voiced his discontent with Marghiloman&apos;s evasions of his promise to introduce complete agrarian and electoral reform. He points out that this is an urgent question, and that there can be no going back either on Marghiloman&apos;s promises or on the standpoint from which the Bessarabiau Council accepted union with Rumania, Yet it is perfectly clear to the impartial outside critic that Marghiloman has not the faintest intention of really redeeming his promises. He has qualified his original promise of a democratic franchise by the reservation that literacy is an indispensable qualification. Again, with regard to agrarian reform, he obviously cannot alienate his boyar supporters, nor, if he wished to, could he do so at present, for his German masters not only prefer, for political* MM. Inculet and Ciubureanu, Bessarabian Ministers in the Rumanian Cabinet, interviewed by the Iasi paper &quot; Arena &quot;&apos; (April 11/24) [quoted by &quot; Lumina &quot; (April 28) ].
reasons, a small clique of landed proprietors with whom they can easily negotiate, but they are strongly averse to any. agrarian changes which might affect the output of agricultural produce on which they depend. This attitude, which cannot be indefinitely disguised, must before long, if it has not already, be realised by the Bessurabians. It is clear that an oligarchic Rumania and a democratic Bessarabia cannot exist side by side in the same kingdom. Each side would willingly impose on the other its own political conceptions,^ While the standpoint of the Rumanian Government is endorsed in Rumania only by its few political supporters, while the bulk of the population is politically inclined to the Bessarabian standpoint, the Bessarabi:ms, on the other hand, quite possibly demand even more for themselves than their Government has claimed.First-hand evidence goes to show that Bolshevism has left considerable effects on the Bessarabian population. The Bessarabian peasant lacks education, has little positive conception of nationality, and so is liable to fall a victim to radical views if put in au exaggerated form. He has, it is true, no pro-Russian proclivities, but in the event of a rapid political change in the Near East, the danger is not to be overlooked] that a Rumanian Bolshevism of a very extreme and dangerous sort may gain a following amongst the peasants. How far this will do so depends in large measure on the wisdom and progressiveness of the governing elements. In Bessarabia they certainly have foreseen and to some extent obviated this clanger by sweeping concessions.In Rumania proper things are just the other way. The only way of compromise is the acceptance of the principle of expropriation, together with compensation for the proprietors. It is on these lines that Ententophil democratic Rumanian opinion abroad is working, and it is in this direction, as far as can be ascertained, that the Bessarabian authorities have been moving. Whatever the defects of individuals, whatever the drawbacks to the union of Bessarabia with Rumania in the circumstances in which it came about, it is clear that the only future for Bessarabia and Rumania on the lines of democratic national development lies in their union in one State, in a State in which the Rumanians of Austria-Hungary are also included.Bessarabia is too small to live alone. It is difficult to see what conscious and serious part she could play even in a reconstituted Federal Russia. Her hope of progress lies in union with Rumania, but in a union in which she will play not a subordinate but an influential part. Though sentimental objections have been raised from the Russian side to the transfer of Bessarabia from Russia to Rumania (chiefly in the two opposite groups of Monarchists and Bolsheviks), it is certain that before long al! sides must accept the accomplished fact should it be shown to be the wish of the populations concerned. Latest reports show that even the Ukraine Government has agreed to the union of Bessarabia with Rumania, demanding only for itself commercial concessions in compensation. Possibly in the future adjustments of territory may be claimed, especially in the northern department of Khotin. But the bulk of Bessarabia is likely to remain, as it always should have remained, Rumanian. The Entente Powers have naturally committed themselves to no approval of an action brought about under the apparent auspices of the Central Powers, Their attitude is presumably that further investigations are necessary before it can be certain that the union is justified on international grounds. In making such investigations the essential line to follow is the ascertainment of the wishes and needs of the Bessarabian population.August 9, 191.8.* There have already been dissensions between the Marghiloman Government and the Bessarabians. The former attempted to impose a civil&quot; and military Governor-General, Geueral Arthur Vaitoianu, on Bessarabia (&quot; Lumina,&quot; June 24), The Bessarabiaus opposed this strongly. MM. Inculet and Oiuhureanu actually resigned from the Rumanian Cabinet, but subsequently withdrew their resignations. (According to the Sofia paper &quot; Voyenni Izvestiya,&quot; July 1.)
