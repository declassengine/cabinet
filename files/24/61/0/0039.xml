lmeniSECRET.^\      MINISTRY  OF   FOOD.Report for Week ending Wednesday, August 14, 1918.PART I.-ACTION TAKEN.Inter-Allied Food Control.The Committee of Representatives have held several meetings during the week, and prepared a general programme for the cereal year .1918-19, which was submitted to the Food Council in a report, and approved by them.They also submitted a report on priorities for food imports, which was adopted by the Council. The Committee was instructed to present this programme to the competent shipping authorities with, a request that it should be adopted and put into execution as from the 1st September 1918.Mr. Hoover returned to London on Thursday last, and further conferences of the Food Controllers have been held Mons. Boret was unable to come to London, and Mons. Yilgrain attended in his stead, while Professor Attolico represented Signor Crespi, the Italian Controller, whom illness prevented from coming to London.Two meetings of the Food Controllers with the Committee of Representatives took place.   The following decisions were arrived at by the Food Council: (1) That each Food Controller should approach his own Government with regard to a proposal of the Committee of Representatives that the agricultural authorities of the Allied countries should confer as to agricultural policy.(2) That the Committee of Representatives should prepare recommendations for providing the necessary foodstuffs to the inhabitants of recovered Allied territory with the utmost rapidity; that any food imports programme for 1918-19 should be subject to revision in the event of any emergency arising in connection with the re-victualling of recovered Allied territory; and that any agreed demand should have prior claim on any food supplies which were available.(3) That the Committee of Representatives should take immediate: steps to give administrative effect to the Agreement of the Food Controllers on July 29th, whereby they were empowered to supervise and ensure the Purchase and Shipping Programme.(4) That each of the four Allied countries should be represented on the Food Council by an additional member to act in the absence of any particular Food Controller.(5) That the Inter-Allied Scientific Commission should arrange a meeting not later than November, 1918, to reconsider the Allied Food Programme in the light of the ascertained yield of the harvests in the Allied countries., Mr. Hoover requested that he might be provided at the earliest possible moment with a statement of the quantity of cereals which it was proposed should be obtained from each exporting country during the cereal year 1918-19. He explained that he estimated that the United States would be called upon to supply at least 350,000,000 bushels of grain for export to the Allies and that it might prove necessary to increase this figure very materially. This being so, he desired to have provisional estimate so that he might be in a position to consider with his Government questions of internal organisation which bear upon the programme.Supplies and Prices.Butter. A distribution of butter was made to manufacturers on August 12th amounting to 50 per cent, of their applications for the month.Dried Fruits. The War Office have increased their demands for Persian dates from 13,000 tons to 21,000 tons. Unofficial reports from Basra are to the effect that the crop is not so large as was anticipated, and it may be difficult to obtain the exportA  (33)6275-3   Pk 1   135  8/18   E k S A
of the full quantities required for the various Government Departments. A cable has been sent to the G.O.C., Mesopotamia, to ascertain the present position and future prospects.Meat. Tho Calves (Sales) Order introduces as from the 26th August a new system of control in regard to the sale and slaughter of calves. The system of branding calves for slaughter which has been in operation some months past has not resulted in any marked diminution in the number of calves slaughtered, and the competition by buyers of calves for slaughter has raised the price of rearing calves to farmers. The new Order places no restriction upon the sale of live calves. A calf may, however, be slaughtered only at a Government slaughter-house, except in cases where slaughter elsewhere,. e.g., on a farm, is authorised by the Food Controller. Calves brought to a Government slaughter-house will be bought by a Government buyer, and calves slaughtered elsewhere than at a Government slaughter-house must, if intended for human consumption, be sold only to a Government buyer. The addresses of Government slaughter-houses will be advertised in local newspapers. The prices paid by Government buyers will be as follows : On the sale of a live calf (including the offals) by dead weight, Is. per lb.of.the weight of the dressed carcase; otherwise than by dead weight, 11. perhead.On the sale of a dead calf (including&apos;the offals) 8d. per lb. on the weight of the carcase, including the weight of the head, skin, feet, and pluck.The existing prohibitions on the sale of veal are removed. The Order does not apply to Ireland;Milk. Major Astor&apos;s Committee on the Production and Distribution of Milk met on Friday, August 9th, and passed the following resolutions : (1) &quot; That the Report of the Winter Prices Sub-Committee, as received, together with the observations of the general Committee thereon, be forwarded to the Ministry of Food and the Boards of Agriculture for England and Scotland.&quot; &apos; \-(2) &quot; That April be regarded as a winter month.&quot;(3) &quot; That there should be a flat rate for the whole of the winter months.&quot;(4) &quot; That a flat rate is advisable for all areas except in the case of stall fed cows and town dairies.&quot;(5) &quot; That the Committee, on the evidence before them conclude that the estimated average cost of producing milk for the winter of 1918-19, exclusive of interest on capital, managerial expenses and profit, would be in England Is. 9a&quot;., and in Scotland Is. 11a. per gallon. They therefore recommend that the basal figure for use in arriving at the producers&apos; price shall be Is. lOd. per gallon.&quot;(6) &quot; That in the &quot;opinion of the Committee 550 gallons per annum average milk yield is an outside figure, and under present circumstances it is unsafe to estimate a higher average figure than 500 gallons.&quot;The Committee recognise that such a modification in the figure of yield affects the sum to be added to the nett cost of production per gallon by 0&apos;24d., making this sum. 2&apos;Qid.(7) &quot;That the Committee consider that interest, profit, and managerial expenses are so inter-dependent upon each other that they may be taken as one whole, and in the opinion of the Committee an allowance of id. per gallon is appropriate under this head, such an allowance representing in the view of the Committee approximately 15 per cent, on the capital invested.&quot;(8) &quot; That Id. per gallon be added to the price already arrived at owing to the conditions under which milk is produced.&quot;(9) &quot; That this Committee recommend that the producers&apos; price for milk from October 1st, 1918, to April 30th, 1918, be 2s. 3d. per gallon.&quot;(10) &quot; That a small Committee be appointed at an early date (a) to consider the costs of production and other factors affecting milk production, and to advise as to the dates when announcements of future prices should be made and the nature of such announcements; (b) to try to devise some system of producers&apos; prices whereby the unfairness associated with a flat rate for the whole country and the consequent high profits in districts of
cheap production and low profits and even losses in districts of high pro-duction could be remedied ; (c) to consider the possibility of obtaining more reliable costs of production of milk from a number of farms repre-senting varying methods of production in different districts.&quot; The question of milk prices was also considered at a meeting of the Central Agricultural Advisory Council on August 13th, when it was agreed to recommend that the price of milk during the seven winter months should be 2s. id. per gallon.Potatoes.- The scheme for the distribution of the 1918 potato crop may be briefly summarised as follows : (1) On and after November 1 the crop becomes the property of the Ministry of Food.(2) The actual fixing of -prices in each of the well defined potato districts will be made by a joint Commission appointed by the Food Controller and the President of the Board of Agriculture as under :  Rigby Swift, Esq., K.C., M.P., Chairman.Lawrence Weaver, Esq., C.B.E. ) Nominated by the President of the Professor ,R. G. White, M.Sc.    j    Board of Agriculture.Horn^KKFkW C&apos;B&quot;^&apos;] Nominatecl by the Food Controller.(3) The country, so far as England and Wales are concerned, will be divided :-j into what are known as surplus and deficit areas, i.e., surplus areas which produce niore potatoes than they consume, and deficit areas which consume more potatoes than they produce.Scotland will be regarded as one area, but it may be found necessary to regulate internal railway transport by dividing the country into several districts, and by making each of these districts self-dependent for its supplies.In each area or zone there will be internal free trade, but exports from and imports into areas will be controlled by means of a Committee. In a surplus area there will be a zonal Committee which will consist largely of collecting dealers and will have a chairman appointed by the Ministry of Food, and all exports from the zones will pass through this Committee.In a deficit area there will be a Potato Control Committee under the chairmanship of the Divisional Food Commissioner or his representative, and this will be composed principally of representative dealers and growers. The functions of this Committee will consist chiefly of receiving weekly orders from dealers to the zonal Committee of the surplus area from which they are to draw their supplies.(4) The prices will be fixed and potatoes will be classed into two grades (a) first grade potatoes consisting of&apos;&quot; King Edward &quot; and the &quot; Golden Wonder&quot; group will he sold in the early stages of the season at T d. per pound; (6) Second-grade potatoes will comprise other varieties, and will be sold during a corresponding period at Id. per pound.Potatoes in Bread. Although no general instruction has been sent out to the Food Control Committees, the use of potatoes in bread has been dropped for the present, owing to the small quantity available and the unfitness of these for the purpose. : New potatoes, at present, are not sufficiently matured for use in bread.Spirits. The Spirits (Prices and Description) No. 2 Order, 1918, dated 13th August, 1918, revokes and repeats with certain modifications the Spirits (Prices and Description) Order, 1918. The Order applies to whisky, British gin, British brandy, and rum. A maximum retail price of 9s. per bottle is prescribed for spirit of a strength of 30o under proof and on this standard the maximum price will vary in proportion to the strength of the spirit. Sold in bulk the price per gallon for spirit 30o under proof is raised from 47s. Qd. to 50s., except to licensed traders. After September 1, on a sale in a public bar, the maximum price and the strength must be legibly marked and displayed. The effect of the Order will be to reduce the price to the consumer, to cut down the profits of the retailer, and to give slightly higher profits to the wine and spirit merchants and brewers.Sweetmeats. Under the Sale of Sweetmeats (Restriction) Order, 1918, and the Sale of Sweetmeats [Restriction) (Ireland) Order, 1918, a general licence has been authorised until further notice for the sale of chocolate powder and unsweetened chocolate free from any restrictions contained in these Orders.
Organised Distribution.Considerable difficulty lias been experienced in North Wales since the national rationing of butter was introduced. The 5 ozs. of butter and margarine combined, which is the authorised ration, is much below the amount of butter to which workers in North Wales, especially- quarrymen, have been accustomed. These workers have not been in the habit of eating meat or cheese to any extent, but make up for this by a large consumption of butter.Similarly the ration of lard is found too low in Cornwall, where the people have been accustomed to use lard for pasties.There is no great difficulty in effecting a satisfactory adjustment in particular cases, but the general question as to how far the habits -of specific localities can be made to square with the adoption of a uniform system is of considerable importance.The hop^picking season begins in Kent about the end of August, and there is consequently a large influx of workers to these districts from the towns, estimated at about 30,000. Arrangements have been made for supplies of food to meet this influx, but the question of handling these supplies is causing some difficulty, as the shopkeepers have not sufficient staff to cope with any abnormal demand.District Reports.It has been found necessary, for naval reasons, to prohibit herring fishing from Scarborough. The Commissioner points out that though the situation must be accepted as a necessary one, it involves a serious financial loss to the ports, and must also cause some hardship to the poorer classes in the North of England, as it will mean that the supply of herrings to that part of the country will practically cease until the end of September.The influx of visitors to North Wales is said to be the largest on record ; 55,000 have arrived at Llandudno alone. The Commissioner reports that the arrangements as regards food supplies are proving most satisfactory, verj few complaints reaching him, and those received being readily dealt with.The question of the utilisation of the supply of venison is having close attention in Scotland. Two and a half million ibs. of venison passed into the market from the deer forests, and, in order to conserve the source of supply, arrangements have been made with the Board of Trade in cases where no other transport facilities are available, to permit the use of private motor cars for the conveyance of game from the shooting ground, and to allocate a limited quantity of petrol for the purpose. All applications for petrol are being strictly scrutinised by the Divisional Food Commissioners, with the assistance of expert advisory committees. The arrangements for the distribution of cartridges are giving satisfaction.Enforcement of Orders.The number of prosecutions for the week was 719, of which 666 resulted in convictions.The responsibility for the prosecutions was as follows : Cases.Food Control Committees ----- 255 Police       -        -        - -        -    80Local Authority     -        -        -        - 74Procurator Fiscal ----- 27 Div.

PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.Imports.The slight improvement in imports of the two previous weeks did not continue during the week ending August 10th (Table A). Wheat and flour together fell, on the week, from 73,000 tons to 51,800 tons. In equivalent grain the falling off on the aveek before amounted to 16,900 tons, and on the corresponding week of 1917 to 77&apos;,500 tons. Rice was a little lower, but barley, oats and maize, were all higher than in the previous week. The import of oats, 29,800 tons, though but 200 tons higher than the quantity received a year ago, was the highest since September last. The aggregate for all cereals (including wheat) 101,900 tons, was 3,400 tons lower than that of the week before.Bacon and hams rose from 13,300 tons to 14,200 tons. The total for all other meat was but 2,900 tons, little more than one-third current civilian consumption.Lard improved to 4,000 tons; only 300 tons was received in the week ending August 1.1th, 1917. Less than one ton. of butter arrived, and cheese was lower than for some weeks past and below the relatively low average of the year. Nearly 5,000 tons of condensed milk were imported, against 1,300 tons last week and 1,400 tons a year ago.Sugar declined from 53,500 tons to 34,000 tons; in the corresponding week of 3917 the total avas 9,500 tons less. The next few weeks should see substantial head-way being made towards the accumulation of a winter reserve. A large consignment of tea was received, hut only negligible quantities of coffee and cocoa.. Arrivals of oilseeds during July were lower than in June, but 12,400 tons above those of a year ago. Compared with a net import last July of 14,900 tons of oilseed cake this July saw a small net export. Importations of oil, both vegetable and fish, were much above average and well above the figures of a month and of a year ago.Consumption.Meat. The amount of frozen meat distributed by the Importers Committee for&apos; civilian consumption during the week ended August 3rd was 6,334 tons. During the same week the effect of the recent rains in restoring the natural feed from pastures was reflected in the number of stock coming forward for slaughter; cattle decreased 9 per cent, on the week before, sheep 12 per cent. (Table C).Provisions. The returns from a large number of co-operative stores and multiple shops of sales in the four weeks ended August 3rd, 1918, may be summarised as follows: Provisions.Butter: Multiple ShopsCo-operative Societies Lard :-Multiple ShopsCo-operative Societies Bacon and ham : Multiple ShopsCo-operative Societies Cheese: Multiple ShopsCo-operative Societies Eggs :-Multiple ShopsCo-operative SocietiesSales, Four Weeks ended-		August 3rd, 1918.

The number of cases this week is 091 less than last, but the average of convictions is 1&apos; 9 per cent, higher.
The most marked feature is the increased consumption of lard, amounting to 37 per cent.; the index (Table E) is for the first time this year ahove that of 1917. Sales of butter, for the seventh consecutive four-weekly period, are again higher; a similar seasonal increase was observable last year. Bacon and hams have fallen 10 per cent., and are now only 13 per cent, above the figures of the corresponding period a year ago. Increased prices for eggs have again accompanied a decrease in sales.Margarine. The average weekly output of margarine in Great Britain during July was 3,960 tons as compared with 3,840 tons during June and with ^,950 tons, the output in July 1917. Adding to these figures net exports from Ireland, the weekly quantities available for distribution without drawing on stocks were approxi-mately 4,000 tons during July, 3,900 tons during June, and 3,000 tons during July 1917. The actual quantities issued by the Ministry week by week for civilian consumption during the past two months are given below : 		england and wales.	scotland.	great britain.	iweek ending 		Tons.

Whereas on July 1st the stock of wheat was 354,000 tons higher than a year before, a comparison with last year now gives a fall of 194,000 tons. The favourable prospects for the cereal year 1918-1919 depend not on any likelihood that it will open with usually large accumulated stocks in the granaries, but on the promise that this year&apos;s harvests in England and America will be good. As&apos;compared with a year ago, barley shows a fall of 89,000 tons, oats a fall of 80,000 tons, and maize a fall of 42,000 tons. Stocks of rice have increased to 217,0U0 tons, and are now almost double those of last year.Large imports of sugar have raised the stock to within 4,000 tons of the record stock of May 1st, and to nearly five times the stock of August 1st, 1917. Tea, coffee and cocoa have fallen ; the aggregate shows a decline of 59,000 tons, or 37 per cent, on a year ago.Stocks of butter in Great Britain have so far been maintained fairly intact by the heavy home-make in the summer and by importations from Ireland, but these will
soon fall off, and unless imports from abroad improve considerably over recent weeks&apos; figures the drain of current consumption will soon make very appreciable inroads into the stocks. Cheese has increased during the month from 11,600 tons to 20,700 tons, the highest for any war month.   Condensed milk is 2,000 tons higher.Beef has again fallen, and at 28,100 tons is the smallest since last September, though higher than a year ago. Mutton, bacon and hams, and miscellaneous meat, were, all higher at the end of July than at the beginning, so that the total for all meats together on August 1st was but 4,000 tons lower than on July 1st.Stocks of oilseeds and cake have increased but are still strikingly below stocks on August 1st, 1917.Prices.Wholesale. The wholesale prices of home-grown cereals&apos; have all increased slightly, but in no case more than a few pence per quarter. English cheddar cheese has fallen to 163s. M. per cwt., the same price as the imported variety.Retail. There were several important increases in retail prices during July (Table G). The substitution of new crop potatoes instead of potatoes of the old crop as the kind commonly on sale raised the price on August 1st 37 per cent, above that on July 1st. Margarine and cheese rose nearly 17 per cent, following recent Orders authorising increases in the maximum prices of these articles. Eggs advanced a further 13 per cent., or 6fd!. per dozen, against 4^. per dozen during last July. Other prices were either unchanged or varied by not more than 1 per cent.On the basis of current consumption the general level of prices on August 1st was 5 per cent, higher than on July 1st.
