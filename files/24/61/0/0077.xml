[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.!   vprinted for the war cabinet.   august 19J8.SftCRKT.n TNAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION-No. (55. Week ended 11th August, 1918.NAVAL OPERATIONS.Minelaying operations in the North Sea have been continued. &quot; North Sea.On 11th August six coastal motor boats operating to the west of Terschelling were attacked by 14 enemy aircraft. Three of the boats were sunk and three, which were damaged and abandoned, were afterwards towed to Holland by the Dutch authorities and interned, the crews being saved and landed in Holland. Four officers and two men were wounded.A Zeppelin, which was following our coastal motor boats, was attacked by a British aeroplane flown from a. special decked lighter, and was brought down in flames from a height of 19,000 feet 15 miles north-north-east of Ameland. Our aeroplane subsequently alighted on the water and was hoisted on board the lighter.In addition to, reconnaissances and patrols, which have been carried out in various Flanders areas by R.A.F. machines employed on naval duty, the following raids have been made Area, by machines from Dunkirk : ApproximateDate.

Mediter-Tftnean.Casualties.Our machines when on anti-submarine patrol have also attacked enemy destroyers on several occasions.In the course of aerial fighting during the above raids 20 enemy machines were destroyed and 23 driven down out of control. Six of our machines are missing, and one has landed in Holland after a bombing raid on Zeebrugge.On 11th August four Allied machines carried out a bombing raid on Durazzo, sixteen 112-lb. bombs being dropped, four of which exploded on the railway and sidings, from which volumes of smoke were seen to rise. - Only two hangars instead of four were observed at the seaplane base, and it is therefore assumed that two were destroyed as the result of the last raid when six direct hits and a large fire were reported. All machines returned safely.On 16th August a force of 13 machines from Otranto carried out a further raid on Durazzo, l  tons of bombs being dropped. Six bombs were dropped on the seaplane base, where three fires were started and only one hangar now remains. All machines returned safely.On 15th August the flotilla leader &quot;Scott&quot; and the destroyer &quot; Ulleswater &quot; were sunk, it is believed by torpedo, in the North Sea whilst escorting west-bound Dutch traffic, 27 men being lost.On 16th August a fire at Howden Air Station caused the destruction of four of our airships including one of the Rigid type.ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.Submarines During the week under review the number of large enemy submarines operating operating, was considerably below the average, only 12 of a type which operates further afield than the North Sea having been located. Included amongst these were three of the &quot; cruiser &quot; type, one being in the vicinity of the Azores and the other two off the coast of North America, where also an improved U-type vessel was working. Activity in Home Waters was experienced chiefly off the east coast of England between Lowestoft and the Tyne, and in the Bristol Channel area.Actions The following Table shows the number of actions between Allied craft and enemywith enemy submarines which are reported to have taken place in all waters during recent weeks submarines. an(j ^ B^me pf the craft which have been engaged ; and also the number of submarines which have been destroyed or lost to the enemy as the result of such actions : 	Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		July 27th.

The percentage of losses to sailings of such vessels engaged in Overseas trades which arrived at or left United Kingdom ports during the week is -78 as against 1-49 in the previous week, in Cross-Channel trades is -27 as against -48, and in Coasting trades is -15 as against -29 last week, while the percentage, reckoning all the United Kingdom trades together, is this week -40 as against -75 jn the previous week.The Table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all merchant vessels, Foreign Areas as well as British, sunk, damaged and unsuccessfully attacked in the last two weeks by in which enemy craft and by mine, classified according to areas. vessels lost.It will be noticed that enemy activity in the Atlantic areas is this week limited to one successful attack, but submarine activity of! the American coast is maintained. As regards attacks in the English Channel a great reduction on the high figure of the previous week is recorded.The number of British and Foreign merchant vessels sailing in organised Convoy Vessels which completed their voyages during last week, and the losses sustained whilst in such convoyed.

Enemy attacks in July olassified.The three losses in the Mediterranean were one in the Port Said-Alexandria Convoy and two in the Gibraltar-Bizerta Convoy, one of the latter, however, having taken place in May last but not hitherto been included in these Returns.The total number of enemy attacks made upon steamships of all nationalities of over 500 tons gross during the month of July was 114 as against 123 in June, 155 in May, 160 in April, and 213 in March.

It is not definitely known that any enemy mines have been laid in Home Waters during the week under review, but it is believed that a large submarine minelayer may have laid a cargo of 36 mines to seaward of the east coast of Scotland and an extensive search is being carried out.

No enemy ships have entered or left men-Rotterdam, but one additional enemy vessel has arrived at Harlingen from the Rhine.FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. Russia.The Russian cruiser &quot; Askold,&quot; the armed yacht &quot; Gorislava,&quot; eight armed trawlers and two ice-breakers, which are in the White Sea, are to be commissioned with British personnel and will fly the White Ensign. The &quot; Askold &quot; is to be known as H.M.S. &quot; Glory II.&quot;In the Caucasus the Cossack Volunteer Army, whose sympathies are pro-Entente, occupied Ekaterinodar on August 16th, and expect shortly to occupy Novorossisk.12,000 Japanese and 1,500 American troops have arrived at Vladivostock and have started moving westwards to relieve the Czech forces. General Kikuyo Otani (formerly in command of the troops at Tsingtau) has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese forces, and the British contingent of 500 have been placed under his orders. Six-inch and 12-pdr. guns with naval crews from &quot; Suffolk &quot; are being mounted in armoured trains and sent to the Ussuri front.Feance.The French cruiser &quot; Dupetit-Thouars &quot; was sunk by an enemy submarine in the Atlantic on August 7th whilst escorting a convoy. She was an old type cruiser completed in 1905, and fortunately the casualties were very few.The submarine &quot; Floreal&quot; has also recently been sunk as a result of a collision with the British armed boarding steamer &quot; Hazel.&quot;Italy.On 13th August an explosion of British ammunition occurred on board a lighter in the harbour at Livorno, causing damage to the Italian light cruiser &quot; Etruria &quot; and sinking the Italian minesweeper &quot; Gaeta.&quot; The total casualties are believed to be four killed, seven missing and 140 wounded, including one killed and six wounded on board the French destroyer &quot; Mangin.&quot;Naval Staff,22nd August, 1918.[Appendices.
