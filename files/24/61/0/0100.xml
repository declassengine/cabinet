STRAND, W.C. 2..21st July, 1918.Sir,I am commanded by the Air Council to submit for the con-eideration of the War Cabinet a proposal in regard to the em-ployment of Indian Army personnel with the Royal Air Force in Egypt, which is outlined in the attached precis,2.       The shortage in personnel of the Royal Air Force in Egypt is most marked..   After all substitution by natives has been allowed-for, the present deficiency is more than 2,700.3.      Until recently the expansion of the Royal Air Force in the Middle East was mainly effected by means of drafts from British regiments serving in Palestine, Mesopotamia, Salonika and India,   owing, however, to the transfer of so many white divisions to France, this source of supply has practically ceased, and the large development of the Royal Air Force in Europe makes the provision of sufficient drafts for the units serving in the Middle East a matter of great difficulty.4,      Native Egyptian personnel is being employed as much as possible, but the supply is limitedt5,      The men obtained from India under the proposed scheme would prove of great benefit to the Royal Air Force, and would prevent in a material manner the withdrawal of British personnel from this country which could otherwise be allocated to meet requirements in theatres other than the Middle East.   -6.       The Air Council request that, as the question is one of a very far-reaching nature, it may be considered and a decision given by the War Cabinet.I amSir,Your obedient Servant, (Sgd.)   W.A. ROBINSON.The Secretary, War Cabinet.
ENCLOSURE TO (i) - G    . 5499. jq wPrccis of propoea 1^ in regara to tJveJEm]) 1 oyment of an * Indian Army Air Force ConTfn^en t. 1 n&quot;Egypt.On 5th Juno, 191R, the G.O.C. Middle East Brigade, &quot;-loyal Air Force,  submitted tho following proposal to the Chief of the General Staff in IndiaIn view of the difficulty in supplying men from England for the expansion of the HiA.F, in.Egypt, and cvdn- to the limited supply of Egyptian native labour (which is obtained on a civilian basis), it wan suggested that the Government of India should be ashed to con-aider the question ao to whether they could assist by forming an Indian Army contingent for service with the R,A,F, in Egypt.There are in Egypt seven distinct training stations, each con-sisting&apos;cf a total personnel of 565 men, together with 56 aeroplanes.It was proposed to allot to each of these seven stations a detachment cf 100 men from the suggested Air Force Contingent from India.   The trades or other duties for which these men are required are as shown in Appendix f&apos;A&quot;. .One British Officer of the Indian Army and a disciplinary sergeant-major would also be required for each detachment.Except for the above, the men would be sent to Egypt as private soldiers.After a certain period of training in Egypt they would be promoted according to merit in accordance with an approved establishment.Rates cf pay could he determined in India, hut it is desirable that the rates should be slightly higher than those normally laid /down for the.Indian Army, in order that good men be attracted.One great advantage of this scheme to India would be that this personnel would form a valuable nucleus to meet future requirements as. regards an Air Force in India.If these proposals received the concurrence cf the Army Authorities in India, it was requested that the Air Ministry should be notified accordingly.In regard to the foregoing, the C.-in-C. India telegraphed as follows to the G.O.C. Middle East Brigade, to the V/ar Office and to tho Air Ministry :-We are prepared to find personnel laid down in Appendix &quot;A&quot; for seven detachments for Royal Air Force, but as Indian Army Act takes no cognizance of Air Force.,  suggested they be designatedhTos. 1 to 7 Indian Air Companies.All technical, non-technical and miscellaneous personnel will be civilian, but subject to Indian Army Act, enrolled for two years service in Egypt, or for the duration of the t-ar, whichever is loss, as any longer period would be detrimental to recruiting.It is difficult to estimate within what period we could supply the technical personnel, but the following is a rough guide only1 company within 3 months. 3 companies &quot; 4 months. 7       &quot; &quot;6 months.
With reference to the telegram from C.-in^C. India, the G.O*C. Middle East Brigade wired that, if the scheme were approved, he was very confident of its success *   He requested that priority in India be given to Air Force over demands for similar categories from other overseas forces.but if it be held by War office that priority is -to be given to Air Force over demands for similar categories from Other oversea forces, it may be possible to speed up programmeIt must be realised that the recruiting of some cate-gories such as coppersmiths and fitters will present greater difficulties than others, whereas, of the miscellaneous personnel, interpreters will present considerable difficulty in view of large demands now-on hand.Special shipping may be necessary, but this will be arranged with War Office in accordance with priority to be given to shipment.It&apos;is important that question pf priority should receive concurrence of War Office.
