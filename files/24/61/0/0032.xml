IS DOQUHDiiT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAtUilC UAJESTY&apos;S OQBhilLiEBO:.RET. &apos;7AR CABINET.$Mft)43 .        USE of IBiag labourers foe agricultural...............1S&quot;U frauds.Ho to &quot;by rir. Balfour covering Memorandum by French ChargeAffaires.At the Imperial &apos;7ar Cabinet on August 12th I called attention to a scheme of recruiting Irish labourers for, agricultural work in j?rance and to certain dangers which, in my opinion, might arise if effect was given to the proposals.I found, that the general opinion was that the French would not find it possible to enlist any considerable quantity of Irish-men for the purpose and I did not press the matter further,This view does not however altogether coincide with the inform-jation contained in the accompanying memorandum from the French Charge1 a&apos; Affaires and the question therefore seems to me to [require further consideration.(Intd.)   A.J.B.FOREIGN OFFICE,August 15th, 1918.
Translation.109MEMORANDUMCommunicated &quot;by French Charge d&apos;Affaires on August ICth, 1918.Confidential.The French Mission sent to Ireland for the purpose of recruiting agricultural labourers both for immediate ser-vice in Prance and also for the period after the war has achieved a real success.   The Mission was composed of M. Ricard, an agricultural specialist of the French Minis-try of Agriculture, and Of Abbe&quot; Flyrm, a French priest of Irish origin.   These gentlemen have travelled through a part of Ireland, notably the Counties of Donegal and Galway, and they entered into relations with the clergy and the peasants themselves.   The reception given to the Mission, whioh was often very reserved at first, always ended by be-coming most sympathetic.     All the Irishmen, especially the priests of the country parishes, put highly technical questions of agriculture to the &quot;Mission which&apos;lit. Rioard was in a position to answer.   Having once established relations with the Irish on the question of agriculture, the French Mission were able to discuss other subjects, and the Irish-men spoke to them very freely on the subject of the war. The French Mission also expressed themselves freely on this subject and, from the point of view gf propaganda, this Mission has more than any other French Mission penetrated intimately into Irish Circles and most satisfactory results may be expected from it in future.   It is now necessary to continue the work which has thus been started by organise ing the recruitment&apos; of agricultural labourers for France where these   Irish peasants will be able to judge for them-selves of the effects of the war,ft. Ricard and Abbe Flynn have received assurances that it will be possible to recruit a considerable number of Irish labourers for France; but M. Ricard considers it would be imprudent to accept the very numerous offers which he has received.   He thinks it would.be best to start by an experiment of sending one hundred labourers from Donegal and Galway.   Theso labourers would spend two or three months in France, and would there b.e divided up in small groups in the most Catholic districts of France among a certain number of landed proprietors ohosen with care.   M. Ricard thinks that he can obtain the necessary assistance in this matter, as he will ask the proprietors who receive the Irishmen and the French clergy to be careful in their relations with the men in view of the influence which, on their return to Ireland, the labourers will exercise in favour of the war and of France.The French Government are sure that they can count on the co-operation of the British Government in an enterprise the success of which is in the interests of both Govern-raents and which has formed the subject of conversations between M, Clemenceau and Mr. Lloyd George at Versailles, Such co-operation should now take a concrete form in order that the transport of the agricultural labourers from Ireland to France and later from France to England may bo facilitated..The
The first oondition laid.down for the engagement of Irish labourers is an undertaking by the French and British Governments not to apply the. military service laws to the Irish during their passage through&apos;Great Britain and during their temporary stay in prance.     The French Government are ready to accept this undertaking so far as they are con-cerned, and&apos;they hope that the British Government will also be prepared to accept it.The one hundred labourers who are expected to be sent to France this year should be forwarded in one or two parties.     It-would be well to send them by rail to South*-amton and above all to make the necessary arrangements for their passports and visas to enable them to leave Ire-land, to cross England and to leave England.   The same arrangement would be applied in an inverse sense for the re-turn of the labourers,A special passport exists in France which is issued to foreign labourers who make a short stay on French territory, and this passport could bo used in the,present oase if the British Authorities consider it appropriate. The lists of the Irish labourers would be drawn up and the necessary documents for France issued by the,French Consulate at Dublin: and that Consulate, and the-French jjmbassy in London would communicate the, lists to the British Authorities v/ho would then facilitate the..-journey of the labourers to France,In view, however, of the present state of Irish feel-&apos; ing, it will be necessary to let these men understand that no obstacle will be put in the way of their journey by the passport administration: and it will therefore be well to organise with care and in advance the journey of the labourers to France and the French Charge d&apos;Affaires would bo glad to obtain the support of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to this end.Albert Gate House,August 10th, 1918
