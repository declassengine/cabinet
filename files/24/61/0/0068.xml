^EEfai^ is the Property.of His Britannic Maiestys Government]Printed for the War Cabinet.   August 1918.SECRET. G.T.-5467.THE LABOUR SITUATION.Report from the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 21st August, 1918.Summary.Part I: General Remarks.The omission of this portion of the Report is explained.Part II: Press Comments:::ff-The opinion of the Labour press on Russia, on France, on pacifism, on the refusal of passports to Mr. Henderson, on the embargo strike, and on sundry other matters is described.Part III: District ReportsThe general situation is less quiet than in the previous week, and considerable unrest is reported from several quarters on the subject of womens wages.Part IV: Disputes.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work. The most serious strike is that of the female omnibus conductors in London and some other towns.(b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work. The most serious case is a dispute at Messrs. Beardmores, Parkhead, on the question of arbitrary treatment of workers by a foreman.I.-General Remarks.Equal Pay for Women.This is by far the most important question connected with the Labour situation at the present moment, and whatever solution is arrived at of the difficulty in connection with trams and &apos;buses will certainly have far-reaching effects. As a separate memo-randum is being submitted to the Cabinet on this question it is unnecessary to deal with it in this report.II. Press Comments.Russia.A good deal of criticism is directed against the Proclamation addressed to the Russian people, though the &quot;New Witness&quot; thinks it is good on the whole. The I &quot; Herald&quot; describes it as emotional, and the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; as hypocritical. Several papers, discussing the promise that the allied armies have no intention of seizing Russian territory, refer to the similar promises of the British when Egypt was first occupied. The &quot; Herald &quot; declares that the most precious possession of the Russian people is not their[1100-43] B
land but their revolutionary freedom. * There were no German troops near Archangel. Our guns silenced a Bolshevik battery, and our landing troops forced Bolshevik troops to evacuate the town. In spite of all this, and the possible failure of individuals like Lenin and Trotsky, the revolution will prevail in the long run. The &quot; Labour Leader&quot; thinks the object of the Allies is to establish a Government which will assume responsibility for the debts of Russia contracted to the Allied Powers under the rule of the Czar. This paper also publishes a resolution of protest and appeal from a general meeting of Russian socialist groups in London, and says it received a similar complaint a fortnight ago from Russian socialist soldiers in the British Army. Opposition to the Bolsheviks, and particularly to their misrepresentation of opinion in this country, is voiced by &quot;Justice,&quot; which analyses a statement published by Leo. Shames in a Russian paper about the situation on the Clyde. His description of &quot; revolutionary &quot; meetings there is flatly contradicted by the secretary of the Glasgow branch of the N.S.P.France.A good deal of attention is devoted to political and socialist matters concerning France. Both the &quot;Herald&quot; and Mr. Morel in the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; fasten on the statement made by the Prime Minister regarding an understanding with France, and his subsequent explanation that it constituted only an obligation of honour. Mr. Robert Dell, writing in the &quot; Labour Leader&quot; on M. Malvy&apos;s prosecution, says that his real crime was the failure to shoot down women strikers in the spring of 1917. An article in &quot; Justice&quot; regards the recent voting in the socialist conference in France as very menacing to socialism generally. For long during the war the socialist party was strong and united. Unfortunately it refused to eject&quot; a small handful of pacifists who gradually increased into a faction, formed a minority party, and have now become the majority. The process is traced through the journey of Longuet and Renaudel, first to Switzerland to consult German Social Democrats, then to London to fraternise with our pacifists, next to Bordeaux, and finally their attempt to go to Stockholm. Writing on the same topic in the &quot; Herald &quot; Mr. Dell asserts that the minority has really had a majority ever since the war began.India.The &quot; Herald &quot; publishes an article which it describes as a very well-informed Indian review of the Reform proposals. This opens with a complaint that the decision on the form of government to be introduced is not left to Indians but is reserved for Parliament, which is to be-the final arbiter eveu in the remote future. The scheme is merely a sort of county council autonomy for the provinces. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; is satisfied with the temper of the debate in the House of Commons, but fears the opposition which is shown to exist by the debate in thy House of Lords.Pacifism.The &quot; Herald &quot; continues to moan over the prospect of a seven years war with its sum of misery and addition to indebtedness, only to end in the desolation of Europe. Mr. Balfour&apos;s speech in the debate on the adjournment was merely a railing accusation against the enemy, and a refusal to hold out any reasonable terms at all. The only ro.nl to peace is over the body of the present Government.The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; also criticises Mr. Balfour in the same strain, though it found some cause for hope in Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s remark on the possibility of peace.Passports for Mr. Henderson and Mr. Bowerman.The subject receiving most notice is the refusal of passports to Mr. Henderson, Mr. Bowerman, and other representatives of the Labour Party and of the Trades Union Congress. The &quot;Herald,&quot; the &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; and the &quot;Cotton Factory Times&quot; censure Government, and see in its refusal insults to, and humiliation of, the executive of the Labour Party and Trades Union Congress, while the latter paper suggests that the present position can only be altered by the breaking away of Labour from the Government. &quot;Justice&quot; and the &quot;Clarion&quot; oppose this view. The latter paper in particular asserts that neither Mr. Henderson nor any of his friends has been chosen to speak for the British nation, or even for British Labour&apos;
or British Trade Unionism. Both papers think the action of the Government thoroughly-justified. Mr. Thompson in the &quot; Clarion &quot; says there is ample room for interchange of views between representatives of the allied peoples, and therefore welcomes the promised visit of Mr. Gompers. The Trade Unionists and Socialists can no more decide terms of peace than could an international conference of Episcopalians, Methodists, or Esperantists.The &quot; Woolwich &quot; and &quot; Merthyr Pioneers &quot; also express great indignation at the refusal, the latter believing that this is only another indication of the Governments fear of democratic diplomacy.The &quot; Nation &quot; considers the refusal the more outrageous since the commission Avas merely one of enquiry, and its leader, Mr. Henderson, a Cornier member of the War Cabinet.Socialism.While it admits that the war has caused employers and employed to act together in the trenches, &quot; Justice &quot; thinks it necessary to point out that the class struggle still exists. Mr. Clynes&apos; speech at Cambridge is criticised from this point of view, because he laid stress on unity between the classes. Surely Mr. Clynes should recognise that profit-making is a basis of capitalist production, and profiteering is merely taking advantage of exceptional opportunities. The&apos;*Russian example in no way affects the soundness of socialist criticism of wage slavery.Fuel.The &quot; Gas World &quot; notes with satisfaction that advisers are being appointed by the Coal Mines Department to deal with the scheme of fuel rationing, though it would prefer modifications in the Fuel Orders through personal visits to works. Further, in many cases the men appointed are already exceptionally busy, and so&apos; can only advise on the broadest lines. It also objects to the appointment of local gas engineers to such positions, since the Order distinctly states that they must be filled by independent and impartial persons.The &quot;Herald&quot; is confident that Mr. SmilhVs appeal to the miners for increased output of coal will not be ignored. It ascribes the present position to mismanagement by Government and bureaucrats, and says that the miners have been doing their best.Aircraft Terms.In discussing the final settlement of the Bock dispute, the &quot;Herald&quot; foresees difficulty over the clause which lays down that shop stewards should be elected by the workpeople in the shops. It would prefer that such elections should rest with Trade Unionists only. It-also regrets the action of the Ministry of Munitions in restoring the factory to the employers.The Embargo Strike.A review of the embargo dispute appears in &quot; Justice.&quot; it is urged that if Govern-ment had agreed to postpone the working of the embargo for fourteen days pending negotiations no strike would have occurred. In any case the embargo must be administered by Trade Union officials, and the settlement must be a settlement for all time, leaving no room for grievances to accumulate and lead to a further strike.Wages.The &quot;Railway Gazette&quot; observes with regret the enlargement of the &quot;vicious circle &quot; of wage increases as instanced by the recent advancement in war wages given by the Committee on Production to employees in the engineering and foundry trades. The Committee has in many cases done well in settling disputes; but its decisions have frequently been used as an argument for forcing the railway companies to grant increases, while Government does not use it. as they should, to secure greater uniformity between the several departments and large industries. The most disturbing feature in wage concessions, in this papers opinion, is the abandonment of the basis of cost of. living.
III. District Reports.London and South-E astern.Considerable unrest prevails among the women workers of this area, though the conditions are otherwise normal.Apart from the strike of omnibus employeeSj which is dealt with in Part IV of this report, the women workers at the Arsenal are expressing much discontent at the difference of their own wages and those of the men, and a mass meeting at Plumstead on the 15th passed a resolution calling attention to the unrest existing among all women workers owing to this cause, and urging equal pay for equal work.At Cubitfs, again, a rumour is current that the women should have received a rise of 3s. Sd. some time ago, and trouble is feared, since the concession of an advance to men in the engineering departments.A mass meeting of the Woolwich Workers&apos; Union on the 14th, which was attended by over 2,000 people, decided to apply for an increase of 20s., owing to the cost of living; it was stated that the present rate of 40s., including 20s. bonus, was no longer a living wage.The Committee appointed to discuss the administration of the Arsenal is not apparently received with great favour ; a suggestion has been made that, as its members are mainly directors of large contracting firms, the men should advise the Government to abolish the Committee.West Midlands.The situation in this district is on the whole satisfactory, though much discontent is still said to exist among the skilled day-workers. In many cases this is inducing the men to leave their present positions in order to secure a position elsewhere on piece-work.The Birmingham Corporation Workers are applying for increased wages. Dis-content among the women tramway workers in Birmingham is also becoming acute, and the question is aggravated by the fact that in Wolverhampton the women as well as the men are stated to be receiving the full 5s. bonus.Some indications are evident of opposition to the formation of Whitley Committees by A.S.E. branches in the Coventry area, and it is stated that the shop stewards are being asked to take no part in the formation of these Councils, but, instead, to direct their efforts to securing a strong workshop movement.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Little unrest is reported from this area, with the exception of the dispute of the surface workers.The question of the embargo now arouses little interest, and the great majority of the workmen are said to be in favour of the Government upon this point.Unrest among the women tramway workers is reported to be acute at Nottingham. A meeting of members of the Tramway and Vehicle Workers&apos; Association recently considered the disputed point of equal pay for men and women, and it was suggested that a national conference should be called to consider further action, while blame for the present condition was cast chiefly upon the men for failing to support the women&apos;s claims. The difference in the rate of pay for men and women at Nottingham seems to amount to 10s.&apos;a week.The agitator, Gallacher, addressed a meeting at the A.S.E. Institute at Sheffield recently in somewhat extreme terms, abusing Mr. Lloyd George freely, and condemning the war as a capitalist device for keeping down the working classes.It is suggested in this area that more detailed explanation of the orders for fuel rationing is needed, since danger exists of serious trouble arising ultimately owing to misunderstanding of these orders.North-W estem.Some unrest is manifest in this district, though it is not of a very serious description.The timekeepers, cost clerks, and storekeepers at Liverpool in the engineering and metal trades are showing considerable discontent owing to the refusal by the Committee on Production of their application for a rise in wages.   Their discontent is- increased
owing to the previous grant of these rates to their members employed by the Mersey Shiprepairers&apos; Federation, and they are now demanding a local board of enquiry.The discontent among the dockers, owing to the shortage of beer, is increasing, and the men&apos;s wives are now showing much resentment.As regards the dispute between the Mersey Trades Federation and the Recon-struction Committee, it has now been suggested by the shop stewards that a new organisation should be constructed to supersede both. An outline of such an organisation is therefore being distributed by the latter body among the men for their consideration.The recent wage award is still considered unsatisfactory, and the Reconstruction Committee are anxious to cease all overtime until an additional grant is made.The Liverpool I.L.P. Federation resolved at a recent meeting that it was now time for the I.L.P. to sever its connection with the Labour Party. This resolution was passed by about 200 representatives of Liverpool, Birkenhead, Bootle, and Wallasey.The resolution of the Manchester District Committee of the A.S.E. refusing to permit any extension of dilution in view of the Government&apos;s embargo scheme is still in force, and is creating a good deal of trouble in some places, while it is said undoubtedly to restrict production.The Carpenters and Joiners&apos; Union in this area are opposing any scheme of payment by results in the aircraft or any other industry.Northern.This area manifests an almost abnormal calm and no unrest is reported. No indication of further trouble upon the subject of embargoes is noted, and it is said that even the shop stewards are no longer in opposition to the Government.South Wales.Except for the strike at the Cleaves Collieries, where work was only resumed on the 20th, the situation continues quiet.Scotland.No disputes of a very serious nature have occurred in this area. The district is, however, in a somewhat unrestful condition.The miners of the Cambuslang area are demanding a rise of 2s. 6d. a day, and failing this concession they- threaten to work only five days, or, if necessary, four days a week.Again the Lanarkshire Miners&apos; Reform Committee is once more active, and is trying to induce the Executive to demand considerable rises. At a demonstration on the 10th, which was not, however, very largely attended, speeches were made in favour of such a policy, of the democratisation of mines, and of the creation of one Union instead of county Unions.A meeting of the C.W.C. was held on the 17th, but no very important business was transacted. It was decided to make all possible efforts to secure the acquittal of Tom Mooney. A letter was then read from the Aberdeen Workers&apos; Committee, stating that a strong committee had been formed, to which most of the men at Messrs. Henderson&apos;s Works belonged, and desiring to become affiliated to the C.W.C.The result of the meetings now being held as to the Coventry dispute will be known on the 24th. In the meantime, Gallacher stated on the 17th that he is in possession of information leaving no doubt of a strike in Coventry, Birmingham, Manchester, and other places should the findings of the Embargo Committee be unfavourable.The Annual Conference of the Scottish Mineworkers&apos; Union was held last week in Edinburgh. The main subjects dealt with were an advance of 50 per cent, on present rates to all workers in and around the mines, the abolition of the contracting system in Scotland, and the formation of a National Union. With regard to the last, it was proposed that the Executive should bring forward a scheme for closer unity at a future conference. The treatment of soldiers&apos; widows was also discussed with some warmth, and was considered completely inadequate. It was finally agreed to put forward the name of Robert Smillie as permanent president of the Miners1 Federation of Great Britain.[1100-43C
IV. Disputes.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work.The general situation is somewhat disturbed, as considerable unrest among the women tramway and omnibus workers has arisen throughout the country. The Admiralty Labour Department has six new stoppages to report.About 600 employees of Messrs. Napier and Miller, Glasgow, ceased worked on the 12th, in sympathy with a foreman caulker, who was to be evicted from his house. The firm had promised to supply a house, but had failed in purchasing one; hence the man cancelled the notice to leave his present house, but the cancellation was not accepted by the agent. One of the trustees of the estate, however, promised subsequently that he should not be evicted without further notice, and the men accordingly returned to work.In the Belfast area a strike of joiners has occurred at Messrs. J. and E. Thompson^, owing to a demand for the 124- per cent, bonus, which, the firm contends, is included in the wages paid.   The case has now been referred to arbitration.Joiners and labourers at Messrs. J. and W. Stewart, London, ceased work on the 14th owing to the refusal of the firm to pay the 3s. (kl, advance awarded by the Committee on Production. It was anticipated that work would be resumed on the 19th.The Ministry of Munitions reports a total of 3,910 men involved in strikes for the week ending the 14th August.The Building Trade operatives at Taunton have struck, demanding the 12  per cent., 1 though they had previously agreed to a 2tf.-an-hour increase, to include all Government awards up to May 1918.  The matter is complicated by the fact that one firm of builders is also a sub-contractor for aircraft work, and their men accordingly already receive the .1 %\ per cent.At Plymouth 600 dockers have struck to enforce a demand for a flat rate of id. a ton. The firm apparently refuse arbitration until the Committee on Production^ rehearing of the dockers&apos; general rates, which is not due until the 3rd September.The War Office Contracts Department has only qne new stoppage of work to report.This concerns the garment workers at Messrs. Bertish and Co., Bristol, who have struck owing to an objection to the introduction ot piece rates. The case is now under investigation.The Coal Controller reports five new stoppages of work, involving in all 10,980. men.   In three of these cases work has already been resumed.Work was resumed on the 20th at the Tirydail and neighbouring collieries.A serious strike of women omnibus employees has occurred in the London area owing to an increase of 5s. a week being granted to men only.On Saturday (17th) the Executive Council of one union broke away from the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation and proclaimed a general strike, though previously numerous women had ceased work without instructions. It has now been resolved that no resumption of work shall take place until all demands are met and all members who have come out are reinstated. Hitherto the strike has only affected the tramway workers to a very small extent, though a meeting of the vehicle workers and tramway workers was to be held on the 19th in order to determine what action should be taken as regards the latter. The railway workers have also expressed sympathy with those on strike. The strike spread on the 19th to Bristol, Bath, Brighton, and other places.(b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work.The Admiralty Labour Department has few controversial cases of importance tonote.The forge-helpers and furnacemen at the Darlington Forge Company are threatening to cease work on the 17th owing to the dissatisfaction with the Committee on Production^ award regarding the payment of overtime. The firm reports that certain adjustments in wages are being made which it is hoped will result in a settlement.The dispute at Messrs. Thorneycroft and Co. is still unsettled.The Ministry of Munitions reports a case of Trade Union intimidation at Messrs. Dick Kerr and Co., Preston, where certain employees disobeyed an order of the Carpenters and Joiners&apos; Society to hand in their notices as a protest against piece-work.
???k) (j hiHaving refused to pay a fine for this offence, they are now threatened with expulsion from their Society.Serious discontent has arisen at Messrs. Beardmore&apos;s, Parkhead, owing to alleged arbitrary action of a foreman. A circular was finally addressed to the Ministry of /Munitions upon this subject by the shop stewards of the firm, when two girls had received more than usually arbitrary treatment. It was feared that a strike would develop upon the 20th unless the foreman in question was removed, but no report of this has yet been received.The War Office Contracts Department has one new controversial case to report: This concerns the price paid for socks at Messrs. Fleming Reid and Co., Greenock. The matter has been referred to the Ministry of Labour.The Lancashire Operative Spinners&apos; Amalgamation have by a ballot vote resolved to strike against the abolition of the rota system. The agitation in this case seems to have been engineered by shop stewards, who desire to overthrow their Trade Union leaders.The Coal Controller has no new cases of dispute to report.The surface workers&apos; dispute is still unsettled, and it is feared that a strike may develop on the 22nd. The miners are willing to negotiate a compromise by a reduction of the time allowed for meals, provided that their interpretation that the 54-hours week includes meal times is accepted. To this the Coal Controller refuses to agree, owing to a fear of the extension, to other industries of a principle which practically involves a reduction of hours.The Gommittee on Production has heard 60 cases during the week, 29 in London and 31 in Scotland. The principal of these concerned the Building Trade, Railway men, and the Engineering Trade.The Chief Industrial Commissioner reports 171 differences for the week ending the 17th August, 16 &quot;of which are claims for the 12^ per cent, bonus.G.
