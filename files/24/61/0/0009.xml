3 i-pCRET.      I  i/ WAR CABINET.It.5409. FINANCIAL TREATMENT OF PERSONS OF ENEMYIN GOVEm^MEfOFraE^ Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Treasury has to issue instructions to Departments with regard to the treatment of employees in Government Departments who will be suspended from their employment during the War in consequence of the recent decision of the War Cabinet against the employment of persons in Government offices who are not the children of t;ence      natural born subjects of this country or of an allied lablnet   country.*   It is proposed to lay down the following rules.-Jinute 7.(1)   Persons who are taken into His Majesty&apos;s Forces will, receive the same treatment as other Government employees who join the Forces.(2)    Those persons not taken into His Majesty&apos;s Forces but who may lawfully be pensioned, shall be pensioned forthwith or so soon as,(during the War) the statutory conditions become fulfilled.The statutory conditions are(a) The attainment of sixty years of age, or(b) for persons under sixty years of age permanent incapacity owing to infirmity of mind or body: such infirmity being medically certified? or(c) removal from office on the ground of inability to discharge efficiently the duties of the office concerned,(3)   Those persons who are not taken into His Majesty&apos;s Forces and may not lawfully be pensioned, shall in the case of Civil Servants with established rights, receive half their ordinary remuneration during the period of their suspension - subject to the conditions stated below. This proposal is suggested by the practice of placing officers of the Navy and Army on half pay.It will also be open to Departments to make similar arrangements in the cage of persons serving in a non-established capacity.    This will leave it open to Department to decide whether they wish to avail themselves of the services of such unestablished employees after the War.Persons will only be entitled to receive half their ordinary remuneration subject to the previse that they shall not engage in any employment without the previous approval of the Head of their Department, and subject to the further condition that where a person&apos;s income from his approved employment is more than one half but less than the total amount of his previous remuneration whilst employed under Government, the amount payable from public funds shall-not be more than will bring his total income from these two sources up to the amount of his previous remuneration, and where the income from the approved employment is equal to or greater than what he was previously receiving from the State&apos;, no payment shall be made from public funds.I shall be glad to receive the approval of the War Cabinet to the above proposals.Treasury.August 14th,1918.(Sd). A. BONAR LAW.
