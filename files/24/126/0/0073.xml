-   535Document i&amp; tho Property of His Britannic MaJosty&apos;a Government, and shouldbe returned to the Foreign OlhTlco if not required for official mac]1 71   JDespatch to Sir M. Cheotham (Paris).Foreign Office, 27th July 1921.Sir,The French Ambassador called upon me this afternoon, to present the official reply of his Government to the latest propositions which I had made to His Excellency two days ago .A forecast of this reply had reached the foreign Office in the morning, in the shape of the telegram in which you reported the results of an hour&apos;B conversation with Monsieur Berthelot the previous afternoon,   I had hoped that the attitude taken up by Monsieur Berthelot - which had seemed to all tho members of His Majesty ls Government who had read the report to be one of a very serious and even menacing description - might find some modification in the instructions despatched to the French -Ambassador.  But, when the latter &quot;began to speak, and still more when he read to me the contents of the document which he had been instructed to present, I was rudely disillusioned.  Perhaps it would be well that I should append at once a translation of the document which he handed in, and then proceed to summarise the observations with which he accompanied it.The Ambassador said that the situation had been changed by the overwhelming effect that had been produced in France hy the reply received by the French Ambassador in Berlin, This had been published in the French Press, and had produced
-    536produced an emotion which could not &quot;be exaggerated.At first I was under tho impression that the Ambassador was alluding to some new reply from Berlin, which 1 had not seen, and which after the advice that I had given to the German Government only two days ago with regard to the further rejoinder that they were to make to the French representations yesterday morning, seemed, to xae quite inexplicable. His Excellency, I said, would r QMriber that, upon Ms initiative, I had telegraphed to Berlin a formula which he had himself accepted and which was designed to remove all tension between Berlin and Paris, &quot;by suggesting to the German Government that, instead of standing, as they had a perfect right to do - as the Comte de St 9 Aulaire himself had admitted - on the legal validity of their case In refusing transmission to large Allied forces across Germany unless facilities for them were demanded by the Allies In conjunction, they should withdraw this claim, on the ground that the question was a political one, which it was for the Powers to decide. The only information I had since had from Berlin was that the German Government proposed to act upon this advice.   I was accordingly at a loss to understand how the reply could&apos; have produced the impression which the Ambassador ascribed to it.It presently turned out, however, that he was alluding to the original reply of the Berlin Government, in which they had taken the line of refusing the French request as inconsistent with the terms of the Treaty, unless it was endorsed by the other Allies.   He represented this reply as one of extreme and intolerable insolence.I said that I was rather surprised to hear this,because,
&quot;because, when we had our conversation two days ago, he had not made this discovery, and I found it difficult to believe that a communication which had not struck the Ambassador in that li^ht should have produfced such a profound impression in France,His Excellency replied that public opinion in France, in cases of this description, was a factor which no Ministry could disregard, inasmuch a3 the matter involved the honour of France and the safety of her troops.   She could not allow herself in these respects to be treated in such a manner by Berlin,  French opinion would be all the more excited and the results would be all the more seriouB because it would be universally believed in France that Germany would never have acted in this manner, were she not convinced that Great Britain was behind her,I warmly repudiated this suggestion, as one which the Ambassador himself knew to be totally destitute of foundation, I reminded him that, not only had we no knowledge of, and no responsibility for, the first German reply, $uite apart from its juridical soundness, (which appeared to be in-contestable,) but that I had devoted my best efforts to ameliorating the German attitude, and to removing any suspicion, in even the most sensitive quarter, that France could be regarded as having been humiliated by anything that was said or done in Berlin,   In these circumstances, it seemed to me intolerable that Great Britain should be made the victim of these charges .His Excellency said that, of course, he did not make or entertain them for one moment, but that nothing would alter the impression that would exist in France, Accordingly,the
* 4 ;**the French Government rested their case, firstly upon the alleged unanimous demand for reinforcements by the Allied Commission ten days ago, and secondly upon the imperative necessity of not giving way to BerlineI pointed out to the Ambassador that both he and I were placed in a very embarrassing position, because, as far as I could see, he had been entirely thrown over by his own Government, and the efforts I had made to conciliate Monsieur Briand had been barren of any result,   I had, after our conversation of two days ago, at once despatched the British exports to Paris to meet Monsieur Briand&apos;s wishes; I had agreed to the meeting being held in Paris instead of Boulogne; I had persuaded Hr . Balfour to alter his arrangements in order to go to Paris with me; I had exerted myself with the German Ambassador to remove all ground of difficulty in Berlin; and now Monsieur Briand turned round, threw in my face all these concessions, and actually - because we declined to acquiesce in a movement of troops for which we saw no need, and which the body which originally recommended it no longer considered to be required - threatened, not merely a cancellation of the Meeting of the Supreme Council, but even, to use hi3 own words, a conflict &quot;between Great Britain and France,I then turned to the docunent itself, and first enquired Y/hether I was to take it as representing the decision of Monsieur Briand and the French Cabinet ?   I had heard that Monsieur Briand was only to arrive in Paris this evening, and was to hold a Cabinet Council to-morrow,   In these circum-stances, I was entitled to ask whether this was the con-sidered Judgment of the French Government, or whether it was merely a repetition of the reply of Monsieur Berthelot ?To
To this the Ambassador replied that Monsieur Briand, though in the country, had ample opportunities of communication by telephone with the Qua3 dlOrasy and his colleagues, and that there was no ground to suppose that his meseage did n/;t represent tho considered view of the French government$his, I said, seemed to me to aggravate the gravity of the case.   I would not, on the spur of the moment, having only heard th3 paper read through rather hurriodiy by Kis Excellency, say,more on the present occasion than that it struck me as deplorable that teuoh a communication should have been presented to me by our Ally,   Any further observation upon it I must reserve until I had consulted my colleagues. The matter was bo serious that it could be dealt with only at a Cabinet Council.  I would take steps to see that such a meeting was summoned for to-morrow morning, in order that full consideration might be given to the communication made to me by His Excellency. I hoped to hand him cur reply to-morro7f afternoon.^en I asked him whether the French Government had fully measured the seriousness of the step which they had threatened, and its consequences upon the Alliance, he replied that public opinion in France - which seemed to be the decisive factor in his entire argument - took a very different view about the va3ue of the Alliance from that held a few years ago,   A series of events had considerably shaken the con-fidence which Frenchmen had previously had in the Alliance. He did not make these remarks upon instructions from his Government, but he thought it his duty to communicate them to me, as expressing his own opinion.  Firstly, great disappointment
**    q    fc*disappointment had been caused by the failure - for whioh he did not personally attribute any blame to us - of the Anglo-American guarantee, in return for which Prance had been willing to make great sacrifices, gsJning nothing whatever in return.   Secondly, there was the conviction that existed in Prance that every Conference that had taken place had resulted in a French defeat and a British victory, while nevertheless France was liable to be&apos;taunted in public speeches with having failed to observe the Treaty of Versailles.   Thirdly, there was the Russian policy of Great Britain, which, owing to the Trading Agreement we had made, and the decisions of our Law Courts, had resulted in what was regarded in France a3 a spoliation of the property of the petty French capitalists.   All these circumstances had produced an atmosphere which no French Government could possibljr ignore, and of which the present situation was a test.Before leaving, the Ambassador, who was I think conscious of the extreme gravity of the positioniwhich the attitude of his Government had created, implored me, in the interests of the Alliance to which we jointly attached so much value, to see whether His Majestyls Government could not make a concession which would enable everything to go on as before.   All we had to do was to withdraw our objection to the march of the French Division to Upper Silesia. We should have conceded nothing of any value; Berlin would receive a deserved rebuff; and French &quot;amour-propre&quot; would be consoled.I listened with respect to the concluding words of His Excellency, and replied that a response, taking into full consideration all the facts of the case, would be handed to him by me to-morrow afternoon, .
