Juvenile Employment Inquiry.tfo tho Right Honourable David lloyd George, M.P., Prime Minister,Sir,1.      I have the honour to present a report on my inquiry into certain questions relating to the Choioe of Employment for Juveniles in England and Wales.2.       I undertook the inquiry at the request of the Seoretary of State for India fto whom the matter had been referred by the Cabinet) and with the concurrence of the Minister of labour and. the President of the Board of Education.    Associated with me as assessors have&apos;been Sir Walter Kinnear, representing His Majesty&apos;s Treasury, Mr. E.K. Chambers, representing the Board of Education and Mr.A.Paterson, representing the Ministry of Labour. 3.        The terms of my reference are&quot;To inquire into the difficulties which have arisen in giving effect to the Joint Memorandum of the Presidents of the Beard of Trade and Board of Education of 3 d January 1911 relating to the administration of the labour Exchanges Act (1909) and the Education (Choice of Employment) Act 1910,* and to make recommendations as to the arrangements which should be made under these Acts for advising and assisting young persons in choosing and obtaining suitable employment, regard being had to the Eduoation Act 1918 and the Unemployment Insurance Act 1920.&quot;4.       In the course of the inquiry I have examined 26 witnesses.    These included officers both of the Ministry of labour and the Board of Education; representatives of local Education Authorities and of their officials and the National Union of Teachers;
and members of various Juvenile Advisory Committees of tho Ministry, among whom wore representatives both of employers and employed.      In addition several memoranda have been laid before mo.5,       The position as regards choice of employment may be sumlnarised thusOver 300,000 boys ana girls leave the public elementary schools in England and !7ales each year and of those a large and increasing number seek help from the bodies established to deal with the choice of employment for juveniles.   These bodies are   -(a) Juvenile Advisory Committees appointed and. maintained financially by the Ministry of labour..     These Committees are established in 130 areas.(b) Choice of Employment Committees acting as Sub-Committees of local Education Authorities under the Education (Choice of Employment) Act 1910.     These Committees are established in 100 ureas.   They are maintained by the Authorities and tho Beard of Education and tho Hinistry of Tabour bears certain expenses in respect of work assigned to thorn by the schemes of co-oporation.6.       In 1911 a iiomorandum was issued signed by the Presidents of the Board of Education and Board of rl&apos;rado which attempted to secure co-operction between the interested i/parties and to lay dorm principles of administration.    That Memorandum laid down the principle tint    &quot;tho employment of juveniles should be primarily considered from the point of view of their educational interests and permanent careers rather than from that of their
immediate earning capacities&quot;.   The Memorandum further urged that Lodal Education Authorities should undertake the responsibility offered by the Choice of Employment Act and indicated lines of co-operation between them and the Ministry of Labour.   Unfortunately, however, the administrative arrangements contemplated in the Memorandum in respect of co-operation have proved to be, in important respects, unworkable and the existence of dual responsibility has led to conflicts between Certain Local Education Authorities and the Ministry of Labour which have seriously jeopardised the success of this important service.   The interests involved are both industrial and educational and it has been suggested that the two types of Committee approach the matter from different points of view.   Moreover, certain local authorities are averse from sharing responsibility with a Government Department, other than that by which they are normally supervised.7.   In these circumstances I am clear that if the difficulties inherent in the present position are to be removed the methods of co-operation laid down in the Memorandum of 1911 must be abandoned; but I agree with the principle laid down in that Memorandum with reference to the employment of juveniles and I consider that Education Authorities should be urged to take up their powers under the Choice of Employment Act.8.    In arriving at my recommendations as to future policy I have had regard to two main considerations:-(a)   Juveniles of 14 to 18 years are in a period midway between the educational life of the child and the industrial or commercial life of the adult.    They occupy a debateable ground in which both educational
and industrial interests are present butneither is paramount,   The two parties claimthis ground as their own; the educationistspoint to their intimate knowledge of thecharacter, capacity and physical condition ofthe juvenile, the industrialists (if I may sostyle them) to the importance of wide knowledgeof industrial conditions.   The extremeeducationists would deny access to theschool and extreme industrialists to theworkshop unless their respective claims tocontrol are upheld.   The difficulties have largely arisen because in many cases the zealof the contending parties is too great to admitof compromise.(b)    For practical purposes the choice in each area as regards administration lies between a system of central administration by theMinistry of Labour acting in co-operationwith Local Education authorities and a systemof local administration by the Authorities,supervised, like other parts of their administration by the Board of Education andreinforced by help from the Ministry of Labour.To make either system universal would require legislation which would undoubtedly provecontentious; the former would mean the repeal of the Choice of Employment .&apos;.ct) the latterthe amendment of that **ct so as to make itobligatory instead, of permissive,9,     I may sa^ that on the evidence put before meI am convinced that there is no inherent reason whyeither a Juvenile Employment Committee of the Local
Education Authority or a Juvenile Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Labour should not perform the work with complete efficiency.Indeed I have been much impressed by what I have learned of the excellent work done by Juvenile Advisory Committees of the Ministry of Labour in co-operation with Local Education Authorities.     Even in these oases, however, the potentiality of friction exists and should be eliminated. j10.    The difficulties which have arisen have been mainly lobal and therefore the remedy should be local. I propose then that full responsibility and control should be offered in the first instance&apos;to the local authority as the best method of removing the prime cause of the difficulty.    This full responsibility and control would involve the assumption by the Authorities of the executive and.financial responsibilities which at present fall to the Ministry of Labour under co-operative schemes.      Moreover, I feel bound to take into account the fact that while the Choice of Employment Act relates expressly to Juveniles the Labour Exchanges Act does not, and that when the Labour Exchanges Bill was before Parliament the Minister in charge, Mr,Churchill, said:&quot; I would like to say that it is very necessary in dealing with young people that educational interests should predominate over any commercial interests.   - We have no intention whatever of placing upon the Labour Exchanges the prime work of placing young people in employment.      That must be regarded much more from the educational point of view than from the purely industrial point of view.&quot;11.    Accordingly, I have the honour to suggest that all Local Education Authorities for Higher Education except those already possessing approved Schemes should
tbe invited to submit to the Board proposals for the exercise of full powers under the Choice of Employment Act 1910 and that those who have already adopted the Act should be given the option of discontinuing the exercise of their powers or of exercising them fully and effectively.12.    1 also recommend that any scheme for the exercise of powers under the Choice of Employment Act should ontain provision inter alia   (i) for the adequate representation of industry on the side both of employers and employed,   (ii) for the attendance of senior officers of the Ministry of Labour at the meetings of the Committee.      These officers should not be allowed to vote and provision might be made for the attendance of an accredited representative if the senior officer is unable to attend, and (iii) for the regular meeting of the Commit taw entrusted with this work.13*    The invitation thus extended to Authorities should remain open for a period of 6 months with a possibility of extension in the case of County Authorities.      I appreciate the urgency of the question but it would be unreasonable to hurry the decision of the Local Education Authority in so momentous a matter.14.    The decision of the Local Education Authority should be binding for a period of 5 years from the coming into operation of their decision, and the decision should be regarded as operative for an additional term of 5 years unless the Authority gives notice 6 months prior to the date of the expiry of the first term of 5 years that it wishes to vary its original decision.If.    I have suggested a period of five years because it will be possible during that period for Local Education Authorities to review their position especially with reference to their responsibilities under-   6  **
the Bduoation Act 1918.   I think it is clearly equitable that Authorities should have this opportunity of varying their decision but I should depreoate the fixation of any period less than 5 years as some of thti difficulties ok tile present position have undoubtedly arisen through the uncertainty item year to year as io the polloy of the Government in ihis matter.16*  BepreaentativeB of the Ministry of Labour have expressed the view that it is both difficult and undesirable to separate the general administration of the Unemployment Insurance Act as regards Juvemilee fron the other work of employment committees.   With this view I concur, and X consider that Authorities who have adopted, or now decide to adeptf the Choice of Jtapleyment Act should be required to carry cut these duties. Acceptance of this obligation should be a condition precedent to the adoption or continuance of eteroise cf powers under the Choioe of Employment Act,   I am convinced by the evidence I have received that these duties would be accepted willingly by the Local Sduoatlco Authorities, but Inasmuch as such a requirement has probably no statutory sanction I recommend that any necessary amendment of the Choioe cf Employment Act and the Unemployment Insurance Act should be undertaken^ The cost of qay part of this work which falls outbids Authorities powers under the Choioe of Employment Act should be repaid by the Ministry of Labour and suitable arrangements for apportionment of common expenditure should be mads. It goes without saying that this will Involve the observance by Choioe of Employment Committees of general regulations mads by the ministry of Labour under the Act In connection with Unemployment Insurance*17,   I hope that this scheme may ensure peaoo. It is true that the dual system will continue to exist in the country as a whole, but in each local area theB*      ^      M N
oontrol will bo- undivided, for if the choice offered is taken in favour of looal administration the local authority will have decisive control wllthin its area, subject to the approval of the Board of Education of its arrangements.   Ir\ on the other hand, the looal authority decides to relinquish the work to the Ministry of Labour the Ministry will control and the local authority has no ground for complaint that the servioe is administered centrally and not locally.18.   In view of the abandonment of the agreement of 1911 and of the oharaoter of the offer contemplated in the previous paragraph, I do not consider that it would be fair to expeot the Ministry of Labour to incur any charges otherwise than for the administration of Unemployment Insurance if an authority decides to set up, or to continue, a Choice of Employment Committee,   At the same time I regard the wide industrial experience of the Ministry as an important, indeed an essential factor in the success of any scheme and contemplate that they will continue, both oentrally and locally, to give any assistance and advice for whioh a looal authority may&quot;V,ask.   In the same way I contemplate that if a Juvenile Advisory Committee is set up under the Ministry of Labour the Local Education authority will appoint representatives to sit on that Committee and will afford all the help in their power.19.   finally,! recommend that the Ministry of Labour and the Board of Edueationsshould establish a small standing Inter-Departmental Committee to discuss questions bearing on the conditions of juvenile employment generally as well as individual difficulties which may arise, as for instance those involved in the necessity for oo-operation in placing juveniles between Committees in adjoining areas, and to supervise the collection of industrial information from, and the distribution of industrial information to, Committees of both types.
20*   I am deeply grateful to the Assessors for the assistance whioh they have given me out o  the fulness of their knowleage and experience and I must plaoe on reoord my appreciation of the oars and ability with whioh Mr. Wallis of the Board of S&amp;uaation has disoharged his duties aa Secretary to the Inquiry.I have the honour to bo, Sir, Your obedient Servant4 (Sa.)
