OF THSMote, &quot;by Mr.H gher*aIn this paper J propose to.set down some points raised during the recent Meeting of the Council of the League ofNations which imply action on the part of the BritishGovernment, and others to which special interest attaches0if ... .^    Mandates?   The Council decided to postpone the con-sideration of mandates ,TA&quot; and &quot;B&quot; until their next meeting in September in order that thejmandatory powers might have an opportunity of coming to an arrangement with the American Governments     The French are very reluctant to have their mandates passed until such an arrangement has been concluded, and the Spanish Representative on the Council has, I under-stand, received instructions from his Government that he is not to consent to the mandates until the American objections have been removed,I stated at the Council Meeting that, while the British Government are perfectly willing to acquiesce in the postponement of the consideration of the mandates, they regard it as important that the mandates should be passed by the Council at its September meeting, partly in view of the objections which would certainly be raised in the Assembly if the mandates were not passed, and partly because it was desirable, for local reasons, to put an end to the uncertainty of the regime to &quot;be adopted in Palestine and Mesopotamia.     It is therefore desirable that negotiation should be taken up with the Government at Washington without \ delay
delay and that the ,&apos;*mericans should be pressed to come to a speedy conclusion upon the points at issue.    I mentioned to M, Hanotaux. the French Representative, the desirability of pressing on negotiations on the French side*At the meeting of the -assembly off the League last November a Resolution was passed to the effect that the Mandatory Powers should submit reports of the adminis-tration of the conquered territories allocated to them during the period of effective occupation preceding the issue of the Mandate by the Council.    The Council will accordingly address an invitation to this effect td the Mandatory Powerse     I warned the Council, however, that though the British Government had nothing to con-ceal it did not consider itself bound by the terms of the Covenant to submit a report upon the government of the territories over which it had accepted a Mandate before the Mandate had been actually issuodo   A&quot;1 the same time X mentioned that it was the intention of the British Government of its own initiative and to moot the needs of its own public opinion, to publish such reports.     Similar declarations,were made by the representatives of aranee and Belgium0     I take it that there will be no objection to the transmission of a copy of these reports, when issued, to the Council of the Le&amp;guo for its information, but as to this I gave no pledgefc
2,1    International Opurt of Justice *   I mentioned to the Council that it was the intention of His Majesty1 a Government to ratify the Convention establishing the International Court of Justice, and that our ratification had only been delayed in order that we might take advantage of the Imperial Conference to associate the Dominions with us in the act of ratification,  his announcement was received with the greatest possible gratification by the other Members of the Council; it is therefore desirable that, before the Imperial Conference disperses, the ratifications of the Dominions should be obtained^3..    Aaland Islands.   The settlement of Aaland Islands dispute was based on (1) the recognition that the sovereignty for the Islands belonged to the Republio of Finland* (2) the concession^ to the Islanders of increased guarantees of autonomy by the Republic of ^inland, and (3) the recommendation that a new convention should be signed by the interested powers for the complete neutralization of the archipelago.The Republic of Finland has undertaken to give effect to the guarantees to the Islanders, but it will be neoessary toiftake action with respect to the neutralization convention. The Treaty of 1856, to which France and Great Britain were parties, is, I am advised, still in foroe.    The Council of the League proposed to suggest to the British and French Governments that this Treaty, to which they are parties, should be revised and ratified, not only by Sweden and Finland, but by the other Powers interested in the settlement of Baltic affairs.     It has been suggested that the Convention might be convenientlysettled^...
settled during the session of the Assembly at Geneva in the month of September,In view of the criticisms which are levelled at this League, it is important to notice that Finland made concessions to the Council of the League which she would have declined to make to Sweden,4.    Albania,   The Albanians made a strong appeal to the Council to send a commission to examine their local grievances., to report on the atrocities committed by the Greeks and Serbs respectively, and, in a word, to confirm them in the possession of their 1913 frontiers.     The Council of the League replied that the Council of Ambassadors was already seized of the Albanian frontier question, that it was already deliberating upon the question, and that it would be useless for the Council of the League to attempt to take up a piece of work which was already being done by a competent authority.      The -Albanian delegate passionately denied the competence of the Council of Ambassadors to decide the frontiers of a neutral power, and maintained that the Great Powers had planned to dismember Albania during the war and that they had consequently lost the confidence of the Albanian people.     He therefore entreated the League to take up the matter of the frontiers, or, in any case, to send out a commission.     The Council told the Albanians that they would watch the development of the Albanian question with care and that they would intervene if occasion arose, meanwhile it exhorted the three parties to the dispute to abstain from any provocative or hostile acts pending the decision on the frontier question by the Council of ambassadors;.., ..
11Ambassadors;   and at the instance of the Italian Representatives, th6 Council of Ambassadors was urged to settle the frontier question with as little delay as might be.It is perhaps worthy of consideration whether, in view of the very strong Albanian objections to the settlement of their frontiers by the Council of Ambassadors, some steps should not be taken to meet Albanian susceptibilities.   If, for instance, the Council of Ambassadors should determine to send a commission to Albania, it. might be desirable that it should invite the oS-operation of the Council of the League. It is clear in any case that the Albanians will be very angry if they get anything less than the 1913 frontiers,5.    Poland and Lithuania.     So long as General Zeligoweki!s troops remain in Vilna no settlement of the i-polish-L.lthuani.an dispute is possible.   Fortunately Colonel Chardigny, the head of the Military Commission, is violently opposed to the Poles, and under his influence M, Hanotaux was able to join me in a strong declaration to the effect that the Polish troops of General Zeligowski must be cleared out of Vilna and its region,   V?hether, in effect, any action will be taken remains to be seen,- meanwhile the Lithuanians are very sceptical ana are more obstinate because, as they say, every partyin Russia is behind them and Russia will never tolerate a Polish Vilna.On the whole the Council of the League       done as much as can be .expected with reference to this almost intractable problem.   The negotiations in Brussels are to be renamed in July, both parties to the controversy having accepted M. Hymans1plan ....
plan as a basis for further discussion, and if the Polish Government will fall in v,ith the proposal for the evacuation of the Vilna district the temperature will drop and the negotiations, which no^ seem very unpromising, may have a change of sucaetiB.   I suggest that His Majesty^ Government should take advantage of the Councilrs decision to press the Polish Government anew to v/ithdrat/ General Zeligowskifs  eroe.6*   Baar Valley.   The administration of the Saar Valley continues to provide food for German criticism and the Council was called upon to, consider several allegations of unlawful action levelled by the German Government at the Saar Commis-sion.   On the whole, M. Bault, the Head of the Commission, came out of the scrutiny v/ell.   He is a man of good sense, moderation and vigour, tfith a great reputation for ability in handling Labour and in settling disputes between Labour and Capital,,   He is a believer in the League of Nations and anxious to conciliate the inhabitants of the Saar.   Of his o\m initiative he has suggested that the i?french military contingent quartered in the Saar Valley should be reduced by half and that all the Black Troops should be sent aw&amp;y.   He told me privately that he considered that the sending of the\ Blaok Troops into the Saar v?as a very great mistake for, although their discipline had been good, their presence was regarded as an insult to the population.   He has also, after a hard fight with the French War Office, succeeded in lestrieting the military courts to jurisdiction over soldiers and our civilians accused   of espionage.   He gave me a satisfactory account of the public temper in the region which he controls and tells roe that he has practically had no labour troubles.7*    Dantz,iff.   *. considerable amount of the Council^ time v,as occupied with the affairs of Dantsig.   Fortunately vie hadthe
the,.advantage of the presence -of General Baking^, who made amost excellent impxouslon upon all the members of the Council,and fortunately also the Burgomaster of Dantzig and tho Polishmanyrepresentatives wore inducted to agree upon  /   of tho points in dispute.   The French are still foolishly apprehensive of the possibility of a sudden German attack on Dantzig and their members of the Military Commission made some unacceptable proposals.    But on the whole a marked advance has been made towards the adjustment of tho difficulties between the Free City and the Polish Republic.    Both parties agreed that the Oon-ventions necessary to give effect to full commercial inter-course between Poland and Dantzig should be concluded by a given date in July.   In General Hateing?s view this is a step     I of the very greatest importance.hi&apos;In general, the work of the Council was greatly helped by the fact that the French have now become aware of the serious shortcomings of their Polish Allies.    Colonel Chardigny, the Head of the Military Mission of the league for the adjustment of the Polish-Iithuanian dispute, told me, quite frankly, that the Poles were impossible, that their arrogance and folly made enemies for them on every side, and with the result that there had been a great ohange of feeling with respect to th&amp;xa in Paris.   I was-thus able to secure the assistance of the French Delegate in putting pressure upon the Polish representatives to withdraw General 3eligowskiTs troops from Vilna.   A Polish Vilna would certainly mean, sooner or later, a Russian V?ar* -(Sgd.) HJUHu FISHER.89th   June, 1921.
