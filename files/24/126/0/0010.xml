The proteotlon is required primarily as a military measure to prevent the supply of munitions to the rebe^foroea in Ireland? and more effective protection can be given in this way at a leas coat than by any attempt&apos;to employ paid special constables.4........ * ... &apos;.i,;. ^     *HI.

SUB*SQtfigMB*4Xn accordance with the request made yesterday by the Supply and Transport Committee, a meeting of the Protection SubHCommittoe (inoluding representatives of the War.Off ice. Admiralty and Scottish Off toe) was held te-day to consider what steps should be taken to protect depots and magaaines containing explosives and other munitions after the. withdrawal of the Defence Force and of the &quot;Hwrai ratings which have been guarding them during the Strike.The depots in question fall into three main groups j-(l) Depots in which explosives for use in mines are concentrated.These are in Scotland and number 11 (including five explosives factories)* 5 of them have been guarded by Defence Force troops,(9 officers and 180 other ranks) and the remaining 6 by Haval ratings (9 officers and 192 other ranks). The Defence Force guards have already been withdrawn and no other protection has been provided.  The Kaval ratings are still retained at the request of the Supply and Transport Oommittee. but the Admiralty are anxious to &quot;withdraw them at onoef otherwise it will be impossible for them to fulfil their commitments 1%  . in regard to Ireland.(2) Magazines and depots in1 charge of the Disposals Ooiomisslon.These number 24 and -oobtain vast&apos; stores of explosives Including filled &apos; sJRBnition, detonators, grenades and fuses.  During the coal dispute one has been proteotod by Naval ratings (2 officers and 60 other ranks) and the remainder by Defence Foroe troops numbering about 50 officers and 1100 other ranks;
but the Defence Foroe guards are either now withdrawn or about to be ifithdrawnf^^Aftfes^ fo^pfrft to,&apos;bq.&apos;pr^tooted by 370 watchmen of varying effioienoyi some of whom are armed and sone unarmed.   The Home Office hag already asked the Chief Constables, in: whose areas   these depots are situated to assist the Managers and advise them what further precautions are desirable.Steps orertiisb&apos;&apos; bellig taken&apos;by the Disposals Commission to destroy explosives - particularly aet&quot;proportionate&quot;ors,&apos;-&quot;v/hibh are surplus to requirements and to oonoentrate the reminder in as few depots ao possible, but the process is necessarily a altfw. one.   1(3) Private Faotories and Magazines.Apart from the 5 explosives faotories referred to under (l) above, the f ol\Lror/itig-contain oohsiderable quantities of high explosives, detonators * ov:&amp;mll arms ammunition.Messrs. Ourtiss &amp; Harvey&apos;s Magazines at Cliffe:(near Rochester)$ Messrs. Ely brothers, Waltham Abbey and Edmonton. Kyncohtowni near Thameshaven.British Eleotrio Detonator Company, Parr,- near St. Helens.Parent Electric Shot-Firing Company, Hewbold,, near Chesterfield.Yorkshire Eleotrio bstonator Company, Normanton.Messrs.   court ss &amp; Harvey&apos;s Gunpowder i&amp;igazino at Erith.Messrs. Kynoo^s, Birmingham. Troops have been stationed close to the last two., but they aro now withdrawn.We have excluded from consideration innumerable smaller stores of explosives, firearm,and ammunition faotories arid gun shops j and also petrol stores.We conceive that the dangers against whioh it is necessary to guard are -(l) Sporadic attempts to blow up the magazines or depots? (2) Pilfering for the purpose of obtaining explosives tobe oonveyed to Ireland, or to be used for outragesin iihis oountryj (3) Organised attacks made for a similar purpose.Of these dangers, (l) and (z) must bo met by the inaintenanoe of a close watch by patrols of armed men at all the plaoes.   To deal with (3) a Considerable force&quot; is required, but the danger may; be regarded    , as serious only In the neighbourhood of large centres of population.We havo, considered the following alternative methods by which the necessary protection might be-given --.(l.) Armed watchmen.   ... l;These are provided  in sicall numbers at the magazines and depots  . of the Disposals Commission; but ws do not think this in an efficient me thod-of protection. ,.?he class of * watchmen obtained has,&apos;hot always&apos; been satisfactory, and they are not, under effeo-tdve- 4ispipline, which is of the highest importance if they are to be entrusted.with firearms.
We cannot advise tho extension of these arrangements! and in the ease of private depots and magazines the owners oannot be required to adopt them,(g) Regular Police. Those cannot be spared from the existing foroefl in sufficient numbers to provide adequate protection.   If the looal polloo forces were specially increased for the purpose, the cost would be extremely heavy, not only immediately but for a considerable period after the need for them ho.d passed away, sinoe they could only be absorbed gradually into the normal establishment,  Looal polioe authorities would only agree to the appointment of such additional men on tho understanding that the Government would bear the whole cost.(3) Special Constables, These would not serve on work of this sort voluntarily and would therefore requiro to be paid.   They would not be muoh less expensive than regular polioet they would bo muoh less efficient! and it would be impossible to move them freely from one place to another aa their services were required,(4) Enlistment of a small force on the lines of the Defenoe PorCeiIt seems clear that such a force would be less expensive than either of the alternatives referred to under (3) or (J5) and there can be no question that it would be more mobile and more efficient, provided that a good olass of man was seoured.  We believe that trained men of good character who are at present out of employment would be ready to join, including the best of those who have served in the Defenoe Force, and that1 if permitted, many Reservists would also do so.   The moral effect of a trained military force, armed and in military uniform., is muoh greater than that of Speoial Constables or, for this particular purpose, of regular polioe.For these reasons we reooramend that tho Defenoe Force should be revived or a special Force on similar lines enlisted; and for tho purposes to which we have referred above it appears that a Force of some 2,000 would be sufficient.   The numbers and constitution of the force would, however, require detailed consideration in consultation with the military authorities, and the War Office representative was not in a position to commit that Department on the point.We may add that the existenoo of suoh a force would be useful for other purposes.   If unfortunately further troops should be required in Ireland, this foroe oould be expanded so as to relievo naval ratings now guarding naval stores (amounting to about 40^ offioers and over 1000 other ranks) and military foroes engaged in the protection of military stores.   Indeed, it has been brought to our notioe that tho military foroes are so reduoed that some military stores and barraoks aro now unguarded.   Further, if men should be required to guard internment camps, suoh a force would bo a nucleus from v/hich they oould be provided, aomOI, (Signed) EDWAKD TR0UP.5th July, 1931.
