In the event of the Allies attac/king the Turks in Asia Jfinor, it was decided that, by pushing forwa-rd numerous irregular bands, a new front was to be at ony&apos;s established in Thrace, in the direction of Constantinople,   At the same time the overthrow of the Bulgarian Government fras to be brought about by the assassination of Stambolls&amp;y,It was decided that agitation was to be started among the Russians in Bulgaria,1&quot;., with a view to inducing them either to ,join tho Ooniliaafiis in Thrace, to assist locally in the- Connranist rising5 or to enrol in the nationalist .;r.v forces in Asia MinorsBuTjG-AHaA.There is no doubt that Varna is developing into a very important centre of Bolshevism in Bulgaria,   it has been reliably ascertained that tho Communists have information as to the whereabouts of most of the secret arms depots in the country, and that they are very anxious that these depots should not be discovered by the Alliod Commission of Control.Ministerial orders have been issued strictly prohibiting the departure of anyoao, including British subjects from Smyrna for Ocrs tantinople./pBJAoIdrissi troops have occupied the village of Attar, the last place the Tsidis were holding on the borders between Jabei Raima and Bura0   They also occupied BaiWel-anama, an important place in Jab el RSima.The Imam is proceeding with the re-organisation and training of his army under&quot;Turkish officers.

He, Imam, has asked the Turks in Constantinople to supply him with troops and military stores and to rfr-ocoupy the Yemen before it is taken by tj-c&apos; &apos;r.:\sh
GREgE.Reviewing the situation as a whole, the Greek Army appears to be soundly organised on French lines;   the troops -are fairly well trained,&quot;practically equipped, morale and discipline very good.   High Command is weak?   coimunications and intelligence are poor,   The men are handicapped by not carrying entrenching tools;   there are no water ainmngameats other than water bottles, and no means of ^gett inrcjw^ either than wire cutters.   The Turkish Army is beiieved not to be well organised or equipped, and desertions are.,frequent. The odds are therefore in favour of the Greeks, who, at the worst, have a strong position to which to withdraw,   Commands and staffs must, however, be re-organised, and officers with war experience utilised in their proper spheres.raze?,The selection of the British prisoners released shows how little real satisfaction the Angora Government is prepared to give.   Of the 8 who have arrived, only four are British, one of these only technically so*   Two moro prisoners are supposed to be on their way, making 10 released in all, and 25 to 30 are still detained.Reports are current that Bulgaria may be tempted to causo trouble in the event of the Anatolian situation developing in favour of the KemalistSoThe High Commissioner., Constantinople, has little doubt that Hnver and the CJJ.P. are gradually taking charge of the situation at Angora and that the Kemaiist Government is entiroly in the hands of Moscow.UNITED STATICOn 2nd July the Resolution of Congress declaring war with Germany and Austria-Hungary to be at an end was signed by Pr e s ident Har d ing,The Idrisi does not consider the clauses regarding the Idrisian oil mines, in the Treaty of Sevres, apply to him, as the Island of Parisan was hie property before the European fito &quot;broke out, and as ho had already concluded a clear and unambiguous treaty, concerning them with the British Government,    He is emphatio in his assurances that he lias only friendly relations with Ton Saud and not an agressive alliance.
