18 -A-  m   &apos;This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,. ..SECRET.THE CABINET.battlefield&quot;memorials.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOB WAB (Chairman of the Imperial War Graves Commission).Since circulating my memorandum of 11th May (CP. 2927) I have had further opportunity of examining the question in my capacity as Chairman of the Imperial War Graves Commission.I agree with many of the observations contained in the memorandum by the First Commissioner of Works (CP. 2959, 23rd May), and particularly with his warning as to the danger of scattered responsibility.I think that the right course now is to invite the Imperial War Graves Commission to take over the responsibility to which the First Commissioner of Works refers in the first paragraph of his memorandum.It will be remembered that when in 1917 the Prince of Wales addressed a memorandum to the Prime Minister suggesting the creation of an Imperial body to he responsible for the construction and care of war cemeteries, the First Commissioner of Works submitted an alternative memorandum proposing that the Office of Works, assisted by an Imperial Committee possessing advisory powers only, should be charged with this duty. The Cabinet appointed a Committee to consider these alternative proposals and decided in favour of the Prince of Wales&apos; suggestion. The matter was then referred to the Imperial Conference, 1917, who, after full discussion, agreed to the draft of a charter (which was approved by the King in Council on 10th May, 1917) establishing the Imperial War Graves Commission.The Commission is thus, by its Imperial constitution, the most suitable authority to undertake this responsibility, the necessary powers are provided by its charter, and its competence has been proved by its efficient and economical administration since 1917. It should not be forgotten that the First Commissioner of Works is himself a member of the Commission, and during the last four years has been a very active member, placing the experience of mis Department at the disposal of the Commission.A step has already been taken towards the solution of the difficulty by Lord Midleton, who has formally asked the Commission to consider how far the object of the proposals of his Committee can be met by the Memorials to the Missing (i.e., to those who have no known graves), which are being erected by the Commission.The cost of these memorials (which is borne by the Commission funds, provided by the participating Governments of the Empire in agreed proportions and voted by their respective Parliaments) is based on the expenditure of an average sum of 5l. an officer or man so commemorated. There being at least 200,000 missing in France and Belgium alone, the expenditure contemplated is therefore considerable, and I am using every effort, in response to Lord Midletons suggestion, to ensure that this should be made to cover as far as possible the proposals of his Committee, for which separate expenditure was sanctioned by the Cabinet on 8th March, when information as to the Imperial War Graves Commissions Memorials to the Missing was not before it.It is indeed possible, if the Commission are given the responsibility I suggest, that the memorials to the missing may in some cases entirely meet the objects of Lord Midleton&apos;s Committee. Plans, for instance, have been prepared and are under consideration by the Commission for such a memorial to the missing at Ypres, the cost of which will be 100,000/., to be provided out of Commission funds, which might in great part, if not altogether, meet the Requirements of Lord Midletons Committee.I have reasons for hoping that the Dominion representatives on the Imperial War Graves Commission may support me in the line I am taking. In this case the responsibility of the First Commissioner of Works would cease, and the sum of 20,000/. put down in the Estimates for 1921-22 of the Office of Works to cover certain initial expenditure on battle memorials could be withdrawn.I suggest, therefore, that this Vote should be cancelled, and that I should be asked, as Chairman of the Imperial War Graves Commission, to advise the Cabinet how. far the Commission, in commemorating the missing, is able also to give effect to those proposals of Lord Midleton&apos;s Committee which have been approved by the Cabinet.L. W.-E.The War Opeiob,Sth July, 1921.
