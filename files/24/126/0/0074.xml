fTliia Documiant is the Property of His Bpitannto Majesty&apos;b Government, and shouldbo returned to the Foreign Office if not required for offloial use.]* DCT %oul..utranslation of note delivered by french ambassador on july 27th. - - -000-&quot;&apos;*M   61 f.in reply to the request put forward in the col-lective telegram of the allied high tewnissicners, the french government on july 16th notified the british and italian govermeras that they considered it in-dispensable to bond reinforcements to upper-silesia and that they were calling upon the german government to take the necessary stdps to secure the passage of these reinforcements through germary.at that time great britain, while declaring that she was not in a position to take part in the despatch of reinforcements, raised no objection in principle to the despatch of a french division.   since then she informed the french government that she could not assent to the sending of a french division.at the same time germary, in a note of scarcely disguised insolence, has requested france to indicate whether the demand addressed to her was made in the name of the three powers which had troops in upper silesia.in view of this note and of its publication, and in view of the british reply, the position of the french government is changed.    the despatch of french reinforcements to upper silesia will not now be made in the name of the allies and for the purposes of their common defence;   it is decided upon for the.sake
- 2 -sake of the security of the French troopp as to which Fiance in the exercise of her sovereign rights is the sole judge.The British assertion that there is not, and will not be, ary danger cannot satisfy the French Goverment. They consider the French troops to be in danger to-day, and still more go to-morrow.  For an ally to oppose the despatch of reinforcements would he an act neither correct nor friendly.prance clato no privilege in Upper Silesia, where, however, her allies have left her to hear all the cost and all the responsibility.The Allied Military Council had in fact originally decided, on the considered advice of the military authorities, that 60,000 men were necessary to secure the execution of the treaty in Upper Silesia.  France alone has Bads the necessary sacrifice and sent the number of effectives decided upon.    She does not understand that eho should now be required to accept the opinion of a British general,  and still less that the catemles of the Cern&amp;ns should be accepted without; challenge.The view taken by the French Goverrcnent, which iaone that no impartial or sincere advice could contest,is that, on the side of the Poles as well as on that ofthe Germns, the situation in Upper Silesia is unstable.&apos;and that the effectives which have been insufficient to disarm the insurgents are still less so to enforce the decision of the Powers.  There is a risk thatconflicts will be provoked? that the very existence of the French troops will be endangered and that thePowers
Powers will tie forced to Intervene with consequences of the utmost gravity, since France cannot contemplate allowing Germany to jeopardize the execution of the Treaty of Versailles.In spite of their desire to act only in concert with their allies, the French Government are unable to defer to the views of the British Government when the lives of French soldiers are at stake and when they stand committed at Berlin,  These are question of security and honour of which the French Government are the sole judge.    The French Ambassador in London has therefore been directed to inform His Majesty^ Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that they cannot agree to a meeting of the Supreme Council on August 4th if the British Government maintain their objection to the despatch of French reinforcements to, Ifeper . Silesia,The attitude of the British Government, if adhered to, would lfead directly to a Franco-British rupture (&quot;conflit&quot;);   for Great Britain would be seen to be as directly supporting Germany against France.   Germany has, in fact, mat France with a. scarcely disguised refusal ana the French Ambassador in Berlin has been requested to inform Monsieur Wirth that in acting in this way the German Government are assuming responsibilities of which they have doubtless measured the consequences, and that it is for the French Government to assume on their part-the responsibilities which devolve upon them.Lord Curzon is too well versed in international affairs not to realise how serious is the present situation.  He cannot fail to recognj.se that it isbeth
&apos; to   ^   *both the right and the duty of Prance to take steps to secure the safety of her own troops which is a question of her sovereign rights. Having regard to the attiiude openly adopted by Germany, the Ambassador would be glad to receive as soon as possible an assurance to that effect and to learn that Great Britain concurs in the view of the French Government.The French Ambassador trusts that His Lordship wiJJ use his great influence to prevent the present issue from placing in opposition to one another the two Governments who have such strong reasons for remaining united in conformity with public feeling in both countries and with the general interest.Albert Gate House.27th July,  1921.
