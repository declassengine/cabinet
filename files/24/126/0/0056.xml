-  in(THIS-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.SSCR3T C.fT1u\55CABINET.Vt&apos;&apos;&quot;&apos;&apos;REPORT BY THE GENIAL OJflOER g.c.m.g.^iNPING-IN-OHIEF ON THS SITUATION IN IRELAND FOR WESK ENDING 16th JULY, 1981,(Circulated by the Secretary of State for gar).The week has passed without any outstanding incident.   The terms of the agreement made by Mr. De Valera with me have been for tho most part loyally observed by the Sinn Fein organisations, with the exception of certain cases of drilling and of the collection of funds for the I.R.A. with regard to which enquiries are being made.Since 12 noon on 11th July, no military communiques on tho situation have been issued to the Press.   This course was adopted because it was c consideration cored advisable and in consonance with the spirit of the agreement to refrain from the publication of any reports, the wording or subject matter of which might be considered detrimental to the object to be achieved, and because it was considered that all controversial matters would be dealt with more amicably and more satisfactorily by the methods of liaison than if subjcctec to criticism and comment in the Public Press.Certain distorted statements bearing on questions raised by the individuals deputed by Mr. De Valera to carry out liaison duties, have however, appeared in the hostile press, and untruthful and scurrilous statements continue to appear also in the &quot;Irish Bulletin&quot;o If these mis-statements continue It may become necessary to issue an official communique.There are certain difficulties arising from the present situa-tion, which I wish to point out because I consider that they are probably not recognised.     The individuals appointed for liaison purposes to various Military Commanders have been received as the local representatives for Mr. Do Valera and his supporters, but it is obviously impossible to receive them as individuals holding rank in an organisation which cannot for one moment be acknowledged as an Army in any sense of the word.   Such recognition can only lead to a claim by Sinn Fein that tho belligerent status of the I.R.A. has been admitted, and any future operations would be made infinitely more difficult.The general tone of the press and public utterances appear to imply that Mr. De Valera demanded the cessation of Military activity and that, this having been agreed to, he on his side as Leader of tho &quot;Republican Army&quot; agreed to refrain from Warlike action, The not un-natural impression left on tho minds of the general public, of Sinn Fein and of the British Troops and Police, is that Mr. De Valera has found himself, owing to the pressure exerted by the I.R..A. in a position to exact terms from the Military authorities in Ireland, as a prelude to making demands from the British Prime Minister in London.   In my own mind I am quite clear that the present negotiations have only been made possible by the fact that the unceasing efforts of troops and police together with tho arrival of reinforcing units from England have brought home to the Sinn 1&apos;ein leaders the advisability of coming to\ some terms before the rebellion is openly and obviously crushed.   It is, therefore, most unfortunate that the desire to create an atmosphere of settlement, should have.......
have been carried so far as to give tho appearance that Sinn Fein io being treated as an honourable foe who has got slightly tho bettor of tho Crown Forces in tho field.   The Troops and Police, conscious of tho sacrifices they have been called upon to make, and of the progress thoy woro making towards crushing the I*R,A* and its barbaric methods, are showing remarkable self-control and loyalty to the opirit of the agreoment.   So far as tho mon and junior N.C.0!3 are concerned this attitude is to some extent the result of ano oasing off of arduous duties, but I feol bound to point out that amongst officers, especially senior and Staff Officers, to whom the realities of the situation are bottter known j there exists a certain resentment which is, in my opinion, unavoidable, and which will certainly be intensified if tho impression that Sinn Fein has gained a success through tho I.R.A. is allowed to stand unoontradicted.Further 1 would bring&apos;to your notice that there i3 no definite basis of agreement regarding the cessation of activity ios during the  present period.   In the absence of a clearly stated Government policy on tho subject, I made certain arrangements with Hr. De Valera, but I have consistently re-fused to enter into any signed agreement, feeling that I was not empowered to do so without moro definite Instructions from tho Government.   The complications arising from the lack of a definite basis of agreement are clearly shown in,the differ-once in tho interpretation sot upon the arrangements madet as exemplified in the two documents fbrming Appendix V of last week*s report, arid in tho representations made to me and my subordinates &quot;by the individuals aoting in liaison^ regarding alleged infractions of the terms of agreement,   domplaints have; for instance, been made that troops continue to bear arms and that Fairs and markets and Creameries in some districts remain closed.   I have pointed out to the liaison representa-tives that troops will continue to carry arms as a normal pai-t&apos; of their equipment, and that tho re-opening of $airs, M arkets and Creameries is dependent upon the repair of roads and -railways and tho restoration of oonfidenco.  lly reason for adopting this attitude is that I am convinced that any con-cessions or removal of restrictions on ray part must be the effect and not the cause of the cessation of illegal acts by Sinn Fein.Reports from Div^slonaill Commanders show that the troops are well in hand-^ that there is little or no feeling against ordinary inhabitants^ and that officers and men are loyally repressing their personal feelings *   There is no doubt, however that in the event of an outrage against troops or police occurring during the present agreement a serious situation might occur..  Reports from Belfast are satisfactory.   One Battalion was sent there from Dublin on the 15th. July at the request of the Cabinet of the northern Parliament.   Military patrols are still employed in the streets but their action is strictly limited to assisting the Civil power and I am confident that the colonel Commandant 15th Inf. Bde. has matters well in hand.(Sgd.)     C.l?.h\ MACRE ADY.
