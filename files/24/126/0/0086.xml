.   -   595In dealing with the problem of reduction in the Ministry of Health Estimates for 1922-25, the Minister thinks it well to make the following preliminary observations.In the first place these Estimates for the current year show*a reduction of over three million pounds on the estimates for 1920-21, i.e. a reduction of over 12 percent.In the second place the ctuwtacter of the chief services provided for on the Estimates and the method adopted for spending the money has to be remembered.     he chief services, housing, public health, national health Insurance, are services of the greatest value to the health and well-being of the people and should therefore stand high on the list of services which it is essential to preserve unimpaired, as far as it is humanly possible to do so.    The suspension of the housing programme renders It all the more undesirable to curtail the other services if any regard is to be paid to the needs of the people, ^he method of providing for the services is a method of partnership between the Ministry and the local authorities and-the insured population and their employers.    Laws have been enacted throwing responsibilities on or giving powers to the local authorities. Arrangements have been made with       Treasury sanction whereby the State shares the cost of the Services in varying proportions with its partners.    the schemes have gradually expanded as local authorities have appreciated their importance to the well being of the people and heavy commitments have been undertaken by these authorities ins reliance on the State contribution&apos;.    The sudden cessation or material reduction of that contribution, besides involving a breach of faith, would mean, in some casea, the entire abandonment of the services, and in other casea that a greater proportion or the whole of the charge would be transferred from the taxpayer to the rate*-payer1 and the total burden on the country would not be affected.It follows that a sudden reduction in the expenditure of thei1
Mlbistry of Health is attended with peculiar difficulty. Defore reduction there must come stoppage of the normal Increase ofwhat has been already done to atop such increase,,    Early in tho present year stops were taken to slow down the whole process of development in health services, so far as this could be done having regard to actual commitments, a system of rationing expenditure on administrative action was taken to curtail tho increased burden on tho rates resulting from increased capital expenditure by local authorities.    It is within the knowledge of the department that the above course   of action has produced material results in the way of stopping   increase of expenditure.    Incidentally the department has had to accept a retardation of the movement for improved health conditions on the part of local authorities, which on grounds of public health is a matter for the keenest regret.The nett figures of expenditure on the Estimates for 1921-22 is  24,010,598 and the main constituent parts of this figure ares-As regards (1) Housing., the Cabinet has already laid down a jpolicy, the effect of which on next year&apos;s estimates is that the nett provision this year of  10,100,000 is estimated to be reduced to about  9,400,000*    A closer estimate cannot be given till later in the year when it will be possible to judge the liabilities unddr the scheme of subsidy to private builders and the extent, if any, to which there may be a carry over under this head on to next year&apos;a estimates.Tlhen housing is excluded there remains a balance of about  14,000,000 provided for other services on this yearfs estimates.    If a reduction of 20 per cent on the total of  24,000,000 odd on this expenditure and justice should be done to  the Ministry in respbet ofhealth services during tho present year was introduced, and strong1) Housing   ... ... ... ....... ... ...2) National Health insurance .. * v. ...I] Public Health   ...     ... .... ......Administration (excluding war bonus)10,100,000 9,235,950 3,085,500 1,550,148

A preseiat saving of 20 per cent isaccording i^practicable but it is possible to make savings   to aless extent in the folding way.Cost of admjjsistration^      Arrangements are in progress by which it is anticipated that this will bo reduced by approximately  500,000 in the course of the present financial year - excluding war bonus.    This is a reduction of approximately 33 per cent.National Health Insurance. The question which obviously arises for consideration on this service la the possibility of relieving the burden on the State by increasing the contributions of theemployers and employed.    After very anxious consideration the Minister has arrived at the conclusion that such increase is impracticable at present, having regard to the reeont heavy increase in contributions and curtailment of benefits in connection with tfnemployj&amp;tint Insurancey When it is possible to ease the position on the Unemployment side I the Minister will be quite ready to take up Increase of contributionson tho Health side, ,and meanwhile he has In mind the reference to a Royal Commission of the whole question of the system established under the National Health Insurance Acts and particularly the question of 1 the heavy costs of administration recently discussed In Parliament,&apos;itUJOOjOOO,
-   598Por next year1 a estimates he considers that action will have to be restricted to the savings secured V the recent Act, to other minor economies of an administrative oharacter, and to a drastic revision of the capitation fee paid to the doctors.    This fee now stands at 11/- per head and the Minister proposes to secure the maximum reduPtlap possible on it.    The savings which would result according to the amount of reduction whioh may be obtained are shown in the appendix to this paper.Public Health Services.   The difficulty here is in the vote for tuberculosis.    Tho grant for capital expenditure provided under the Finance Act of 1911 will be exhausted in the next finan-cial year and money will need to be voted to meet what are con-contractual commitments in precisely the same way as the signed contracts for housing, whioh the Cabinet has accepted as obligations to be met even in the present financial straits.    These commit^ ments have been examined in detail, and the whole of the rest of the estimate for public health services, and the result is that an increase of  500,000 will be required for tuberculosis when full allowance is made for what can be saved on other services, by practically Stopping all development, suspending less essen&amp;Lal services, and restricting the expenditure on the supply of milk free or    *at leas than cost price to a total of  25,000 per annum for the whole country.The general result is shown in the attached statement - (a., minimum reduction of approximately 8 per cent following a reduction of approximately 12 per cent this year1 - of 20 per cent in two . years.The Minister regrets that, with any due regard to the duties of his office,, he cannot go further than the above reduction.    The necessary curtailment which has already been made in the housing programme is creating very grave difficulties with looal
suthpritioa and with the friends of reform in the country. It would be fatal to add to tho curtailment of housing a crippling of national health insurance or the public health Services, and the maximum amount which could be saved in this way would be out of all proportion to the storm of controversy and opposition aroused and to the damege inflicted on the national life.
