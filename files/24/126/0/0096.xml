PART   II.   G3T5PAL   INTHuLIGSNOH.IIE S QPQTA!,! I A.The Amir Faisal has received a very striking reception from the Arabs in Dulaim Liwah,Prom Pal In 3 ah, on the Euphrates to Raraadi his oar \ms escorted by bodies of -alloping horsemen.   At Raraadi a rrreat tribal -:atherinp was held followed by a gargantuan feast9   The Anir s speech was loudly approved.In the evening the leaflinr? townsmen of all the Euphrates towns from Fallujah to the frontier at Qualm tools the oath of allegianoe at Ramadl.EGYPT.There is evidence that Eemalist propaganda is producing more than normal excitement among fanatical and ignorant extremists, among whom Kemal s proclamation from Angora, promising independence to India and Egypt has made a great Impression.   Zaghloul himself seems now more inclined to seek assistance from the Kemalist movement.The damer of anti-foreign disturbances is evidently causing considerable unrest among the poorer olasses of Europeans, who are reported by the passport offices to be leaving the country in large numbers,     It is generally believed that if military control were removed a very small incident would suffice to precipitate another outburst.RUSS I A.The Finnish minister to Moscow has lately returned to Helsingfors and maintains that demobilisation of the Russian army has taken place and that only mobilisation of reliable communists has been effected, who are to be used chiefly in repelling the starving masses reported to he advancing towards Moscow...   Orders were issued on 11th July to use. poison gas if necessary *   The Soviet Government intend to use all available measuresto combat possible anarch!a1 conditions.     Pood and general conditions in Russia are considerably worse than they were in June.G E PRAIA.Reports have been received of the concentration of Russian troops in Georgia and that the Headquarters of the Caucasus Army will be transferred from Ro&amp;loff to Tiflis.. Attempts are being made to reorganise the railways in view of possible military operations.SIBES I A.wV a     ^:vI:^nls^eJ at Peldn reports that Urga was captured by Joint Soviet and Chita force on July 5th and that Ungern had retreated towards Manchuli.   This is a setback to the reactionary forces and will further retard Semenoffr3 schemes of co-opvration with Ungern.
A L B A N I A,The IvlircCites have entirely surrendered,,   Government troops have occupied Oroshi, and Mark-Joni has fled to Prisrend with a few followers.D A N U BE.The convention providing for the adminlstration of the Danube, drawn up by the Conference in Paris, was signed on 23rd July.T U REELThe second phase of the Greek offensive is about to begint   The Turks are occupying the line Sivrihissar -Gougouzdagh, but there are indications of a withdrawal of their left flank to a position behind the&apos; Sakaria River. This withdrawal is regarded by the Constantinople Turks as an indication of the state of the Nationalist army^ and General Earing ton is of opinion that it is incapable of much further resistance.The Turkish counter attack on Chlvril has been repulsed, and the Greeks have started an offensive towards Chai.   They are also advancing on Demirji and Ishikli..It is reported that Greek troops are being landed at Ineboli and that the 11th Greek Division is to be used to clear the Geive and Ismid areas..JUGQ-SLAVIA,In view of the situation created by the assassina&apos; tion of !v&apos;BDraskovitch, Parliament will be reassembled on 30th July to pass legislation for the protection of the State against communistic action.JAPAN.A serious strike is in progress at the Kawasaki Dockyard at Kobe, and a similar situation has arisen at the Fujingata Yard.   The point at issue is recognition of the men s unions.   Japanese Warships are under construction at both these Yards *   Negotiations have been opened and it is thought that the strikes will be settled without serious trouble.SPA IN.Morocco.No details have &quot;&quot;been received of the Spanish defeat in Morocco but it appears to have been a severe one and only about 200 men out of a force of 16 - 17*000 have returned to Melillao    The remainder with their guns and equipment will probably fall into the hands^f the RLffians.   Melilla Itself is considered to be safe at the present.There has been some rioting at Bilbao which prevented troops, who v/ere being sent as reinforcements, leaving.
CHI N A.There is some Tound for believing that Chang-tso- lin, who is supreire in the north, is planning to restore the Monarchy *     On the other hand, althougn Sun*-Yat-Sen* the recently elected &quot;President11, has no control and little influence outside the province of Kwantun^, yet the idea of converting China into a Pedoral republic has steadily gained ground during the last few months.
