In the former, the men have been voting upon the employers&apos; revised terms, and have decided in favour of accepting them ; in the latter, the employers and workers have agreed that the question of the withdrawal ot the &quot; standard ship cycle &quot; of advances shall be referred to a special board of arbitration appointed under Section 2 (2) (c) of.the Industrial Courts Act, 1919.A series of demonstrations of agricultural workers is being organised by the two unions concerned, with the aid of the national Labour organisations, against the proposed abolition of the Agricultural Wages Board.The most important group of disputes in progress during the week, as regards the number of men involved, have been in coal mines. At certain collieries, principally in South Wales and Monmouthshire, Derbyshire and Staffordshire, a resumption of work has not taken place, owing to local differences. A greater number of miners, however, have in all probability, been affected by the inevitable difficulties of resuming work, caused by the effects of the prolonged nature of the recent dispute.The Annual General Meeting of the National Union of Railwaymen concluded on the 9th July. At this session, much time was spent in discussing the conduct of the executive and officers as regards both the Triple Alliance strike proposed towards the beginning of the recent coal dispute, and the negotiations which determined the provisions of Part IV of the Railways Bill. The discussion resulted in votes of confidence and approval.The estimated total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 8th July was 2,120,201. This figure is approximately the same as that of the 27th May, at the end of the eighth week of the coal dispute. Unemployment insurance and live register figures for the 1st July are given in the statistical appendix below.(34128-31) WU4-R5 600 7/21 H.St. G.99/3
16.7.21FEATURES  OF  THE  WEEK.Industrial and Other Organisations.National Union of BaUwaymen. In last week&apos;s issue 61 this Report an account was given of the opening session of the Annual General Meeting of the National Union of Railwaymen, which was held on the 4th July. The meeting was continued throughout the week, and concluded on the 9th July.It was decided that the discussion on the failure of the Triple Alliance to support the miners in their dispute should be held in camera.&apos; A resolution was adopted protesting against the action of the Government in passing the Emergency Powers Act, declaring that it is a &quot; standing menace to freedom,&quot; and demanding its immediate repeal. A resolution on the unemployment problem reaffirmed previous declarations that it was the duty of the State to provide work or adequate maintenance, but declared that, in order to secure this, it would be necessary to change the existing social system. The first part of this resolution was severely criticised by Mr. Cramp, industrial secretary of the union, who objected to the assumption that economic conditions could be altered merely by legislation. The conference then discussed the Railways Bill, and endorsed the agree -ment made by the executive with the railway companies for the reconstitution of the National Wages Board and the establishment of local machinery for dealing with disputes. The executive^ refusal to accept minority representation on the companies&apos; directorates was also approved. Mr. Thomas made a speech dealing with the Bill and the railway outlook generally, and stated that it was essential, not only for railwaymen, but for the country as a whole, that the Bill should be passed ; otherwise, there would not only be industrial strife but financial chaos.A resolution was passed dealing with the position of railway shopmen, in which it was stated that the National Union of Railwaymen and the Federation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Trades had agreed to submit the shopmen&apos;s wages&apos; claims to arbitration, but the Amalgamated Engineering Union had refused to do so. Failing a satisfactory settle-ment of the shopmen&apos;s claims, the conference decided to take the earliest opportunity of using the full force of the union on their behalf.By 60 votes to 20, the conference endorsed the action of Mr. Thomas in cancelling the notices and abandoning the sympathetic strike of railway workers on the 15th April. The discussion on this question took a course which made the vote, in effect, one of confidence in Mr. Thomas.The inquiry into the shooting of railwaymen at Mallow, on the 31st January, was next discussed, and was condemned as biassed ; a resolution was passed demanding that the compensation awarded to the railwaymen by the Recorder of Cork should be paid at once.Mr. J. Marchbanks, of Glasgow, was elected president of the union for the ensuing year, and Mr, Lazenby, of Kentish Town, was elected treasurer.Next year&apos;s conference is to be held at Bradford.Scottish Council of Textile Trade Unions. The annual delegate meeting of this Council, which has a membership of approximately 50,000, and covers all unions confined to textile workers in Scotland, was recently held at Edinburgh. The following officers were elected for the ensuing year : President, Mr. John F. Sime, Union of Jute and Flax Workers, Dundee and District ; treasurer, Mr. David Inglis, Calender, Linoleum and Dye Workers&apos; Union, Dundee and District; and secretary, Mr. John C. Hendry, Brechin Mill and Factory Operatives&apos; Union.The new executive were instructed to make inquiries as to the hours of labour, wages and conditions of employment generally, that prevail in the various branches of the textile industry on the Continent and elsewhere, with power to send a delegation to inquire into the same if considered necessary, after consultation with the various unions, so that first-hand knowledge on these matters might be obtained.National Union of Genera1- Workers. It is reported that the General Council of the National Union of General Workers have decided that every member shall pay a special levy of 5s. to the union funds before the end of the year, in order to meet the increased calls in respect of unemployment. This is additional to the levy of os. decided on in April last, for the then current quarter, and is a further instance of the depletion of trade union funds, which wras recorded in last week&apos;s Report in connection with the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen./
Features of the YIeek-continued. General Topics.Agriculture Act. As a result of the attitude towards wages reductions taken up by the appointed members of the Agricultural Wages Board, the employers&apos; representatives have resigned from the Board. A further meeting is to be held on the 21st July, when the position will again be considered.A demonstration of 10,000 people, representing 56 branches of the National Union of Agricultural Workers was held at Ipswich on the 10th July, and a resolution was passed protesting against the action of the Government in proposing to abolish the Agricultural Wages Board, and declaring that every constitutional means should be used to break the Coalition Government, and replace it by a Labour Government pledged to establish a new Wages Board.Nationalisation of the Wool Textile Industry, A committee, representing the Labour Party, the Trades Union Congress, the Co-operative Union, the Triple Alliance and some of the largest trade unions of the country, have been considering the question of the nationalisation of the wool textile industry. Although the committee&apos;s full scheme has not yet been officially published, a forecast has been issued, from which it appears that the committee advocate that the principal raw material, wool, should be bought, imported and distributed by the State. The scheme also suggests that the wool-combing section, which has already been partly unified, might be nationalised at once, as well as the sorting, carbonising and shoddy manufacturing firms As regards worsted spinning and manufacturing, finishing and ancillary processes, hosiery manufacturing, and blanket and flannel manufacturing, it is proposed that they should, in the first instance, come under public control while remaining under private ownership. That is to say, profits would be controlled, costs records instituted, and the books of firms examined when thought necessary. The State would, therefore, take power to acquire the whole industry, but it would not exercise that power to the full immediately. The State would also provide woollen manufacturers with wool, wool-tops and shoddy at fixed prices. It is suggested that worsted spinners and manufacturers would be allowed a flat rate of return on their capital, and, in addition, individual firms would be entitled to an efficiency bonus. The remaining profits would accrue to the State, and would be used by a Board of Trustees, responsible to a Minister of the Crown, for the purchase of undertakings in the woollen and worsted industry. It would be necessary to set up a Ministry of Wool and Wool Textiles.Trades Union Congress and&apos;Labour Party: Co-ordination.-Th.e approval by the annual conference of the Labour Party of a draft scheme for the establishment, in conjunction with the Trades Union Congress, of a &quot;National Joint Council,&quot; and of a series of joint departments, marked a further step in the progress of what is popularly known as the Labour &quot;General Staff&quot; movement.^ The railway strike of 1919, and the part played in its settlement by the self-constituted &quot; mediation committee &quot; resulted in a movement, which had at its beginning considerable impetus, for a re-organisation of the headquarters of the Trades Union Congress, for the setting up of permanent bodies to co-ordinate the work of the national Labour organisations, and for the establishment of a series of &quot; common services departments.&quot;The scheme for the re-modelling of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trader Union Congress and of its office organisation was presented to, and approved by, the Trades Union Congress at its annual meeting last year.fThe setting up of permanent co-ordinating bodies has been complicitecl by the uncertain attitude of the co-operative movement. The &quot;General Staff&quot; movement, in this its wider aspect, set out to bring together the Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party, and the co-operative movement. This attempt found expression in.the proposed &quot; Labour and Co-operative Political Alliance,&quot; which was approved by the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress last year, but was rejected by the Co-operative Congress this year.J The scheme approved by the Labour Party Conference last month, and to be submitted to the Trades Union Congress in September, has no reference to the co-operative movement. The proposed National Joint Council is a combination of the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress only.* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 25, 18th June, p. W, and Vol. IV, No. 1, 2nd July, p. 2. . t See this lleport, Vol. II, No. 2,10th July, pp. 44-46, and No. 12,18th September, p. 360. X See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 22, 28th May, p. 448.
16.7.2140The text of the proposed constitution of the National Joint Council is given in the July issue of the Labour Gazette (pages 340-341). Briefly, it is proposed that the Council shall consist of five representatives each of the General Council of the Trades Union Congress, of the Executive Committee of the Labour Party, and of the Parliamentary Labour Party. The Joint Council will consult, where necessary, a Joint Conference comprising, as to one-halt of its membership, the full General Council of the Trades Union Congress, and as to the other half, the full Executive Committee of the Labour Party, together with the number of Parliamentary members required to make the two halves balance. The chairman of the General Council and secretary of the Labour Party will act, respectively, as chairman and secretary of the Joint. Council.The original proposal for setting up &quot; common services departments &quot; put before the Trades Union Congress in December, 1919, was for the establishment of three joint departments, namely, Kesearch, Legal and Publicity Departments, to be at the service of, and financed by, the Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party, and the co-operative movements The scheme as reported to the Labour Party at Brighton provides for control of the joint departments by the General Council of the Trades Union Congress and the Executive Committee of the Labour Party. The expenditure of the departments will be met equally by the two national bodies, and will be controlled by one of the secretaries of the two bodies, who will act as financial secretary for the joint departments, and by a joint finance sub-committee. The chairmen and secretaries of the national bodies will be responsible for the general control of the work of the joint departments, and each department will have attached to it a joint sub-committee to which its responsible officer will act as secretary. Four departments are proposed, namely, Research, International, Legal and Publicity Departments.The proposals really comprise two separate schemes, the scheme for co-ordination being essentially separate from that for common services departments. A common feature of im-portance about both is the non-participation of the co-operative movement. With regard to the first scheme the place of the co-operative movement in the Labour trinity is assumed by the Parliamentary Labour Party, and the ne*w &quot; National Joint Council &quot; is a replica of the &quot; Council of Action &quot; as first constituted on the 9th August last year. The draft con-stitution contains no provisions giving the National Joint Council power to summon on its own initiative a national joint conference representative of the constituent bodies of the Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party, such as met on five occasions from August, 1920, to February, 1921. When the National Joint Council needs to report to a joint body, it will consult the rather anomalous &quot; joint conference.&quot; On the other hand, it is contemplated that the Council may incur expenditure on distinct enterprises of its own.The second scheme is entirely separate from the first, in that there is no organic connection between the National Joint Council and the departments under joint control. The first scheme now only requires the approval of the Trades Union Congress in September before it is put into operation ; but, in the case of the second scheme, which involves internal office re-organisation, approval may not necessarily mean operation. In particular, difficulties may arise over the Labour Research Department, which is intended to be the new joint &quot; Research Department.&quot; The Labour Research Depart-ment is an independent organisation, free from the control cf either the Labour Party or the Trades Union Congress ; it is not a party at present to the &quot;common services&quot;&apos; scheme; and the immediate practical importance of that scheme depends to some degree upon the question whether the Labour Research Department be incorporated or not.NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Shipbidlders (National). As a result of a conference of representatives of the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation and the Amalgamated Union of Shipbuilding, Engineering and Constructional Workers, held at Montagu House on the 8th July, it was agreed that the claim of the. employers for the withdrawal of the &quot; standard ship cycle of advances should be referred for arbitration under the International Courts Act, 1919, the Court to consist of one representative from each side, with an independent chairman nominated by the department.Heating and Domestic Engineers. (National). Negotiations have been taking place between the National Association of Master Heating and Domestic Engineers and the* See this Report Vol. II, No. 6, 7th August 1920, p. 199.

No agreement, however, could be reached, and the employers issued notices that reductions would take place of \\d. per hour on the 1st July ; Id. per hour on the 1st August; Id. per hour on the 1st Septem-ber ; and a further reduction of \d. for each 5 points drop in the cost-of-living index number as from the 1st October.On the 24th June the union requested the department to intervene, and a conference of the representatives of the two sides was held at Montagu House on the 28th June. After considerable discussion, the parties agreed to recommend the following as a settle-ment of the dispute : A reduction of 2d. per hour on the 15th July, and a further Id. on the 1st September.In the event of the Lccbour Gazette cost-of-living index number for October being at or under 100 per cent, above pre-war cost, a further reduction of \d. per hour to take effect on the 1st November.No further variation of wages betore the 31st December, and a conference of the parties to be held early in December to consider the rate to be paid in January, 1922.A ballot vote of the men, which is to be completed by the 13th July, is being taken on these terms. Meanwhile, the employers&apos; association have agreed to suspend their notices.Bobbin and Shuttle Makers (National). A meeting of the Joint Industrial Council for the Bobbin and Shuttle Making Industry has been arranged for the 18th July, for the purpose of considering an application from the employers&apos; side of the Council for the following reductions in wages : Skilled workers 4s. %d. per week, semi-skilled workers 4s. per week, labourers 7s. Qd. per week ; women 6s. Qd. per week ; workers under 18 years of age 15 &quot;per cent, from the scale rate.Co-operative Employees (Scotland). The Scottish Co-operative Wages Board have approached the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers on the question of a modification of Sheriff Fyfe&apos;s Award dated the 17th February.^ Two meetings between representatives of the executive of the Board and the officials of the union have been held, but owing to the diversity of opinion existing among the members of the union, little progress has been made. A conference of branch delegates from the union has been convened for the 3rd August, and it is expected that a formal conference with the Wages Board will be held shortly afterwards.- Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services, Manual Workers (Scotland). It will be remembered that the Joint Industrial Council met on the 28th June, when proposals made by the employers&apos; side for an immediate reduction in wages were discussed. On the 5th July the discussion was continued, but no agreement was arrived at. The trade union side intimated that they could not accept the employers&apos; proposals immediately, and suggested that they should be referred to the executive committee of the Council for consideration. The employers&apos;, side, however, refused to accept this, and intimated that, in view of the failure to agree, the whole proposals were withdrawn and each local authority would now he advised to deal with its own wages questions. It is understood that an attempt is being made to persuade the employees&apos; representatives to meet and again discuss the position.Strikes and Lockouts.Shipyard Joiners (National). The ballot vote of the men on the employers&apos; pro-posals for reductions in wagesf has resulted in the rejection of the terms by 8,421 votes to 3,890.These proposals involved an immediate reduction of 12s. 9d. per week made up of the 6s. per week reduction agreed upon with other workers at Carlisle on the 19th April,J which, having regard to the operation of the 12J per cent, bonus, is equivalent to 6s. 9d. per week, and an additional 6s. per week, being half the amount originally intended to be withdrawn.
16.7.2142* See this Report, Vol. III., No. 25,18th June, p. 502.Settlements and Agreements.Builders (National). The National Wages and Conditions Council for the Building Trades met in London on the 6th July, when an agreement was reached respecting the difference between craftsmen&apos;s and labourers&apos; wages, as follows : Where the craftsmen^ rate on the 1st May, 1921, was over 2s. 2d. per hour, the difference between the craftsmen&apos;s and labourers&apos; rate on the 1st August shall be id. per hour, and on the 1st September bd. per hour. Where the rate was Is. ll^rf. and not more than 2s. 2d. the difference on the 1st August shall be id., and on the 1st September i\d. per hour. Where it was Is. 10c?. to Is. \ \\d., inclusive, the difference shall be id. The sliding scale,, will operate upon this basis, provided always that the rate paid to labourers shall not be less than 75 per cent, of the craftsmen&apos;s rate.Brick Makers (Sheffield). Following negotiations between the Sheffield and District Brick Makers&apos; Association and the National Amalgamated Union of Labour, an agreement has been reached for a reduction in wages of i\d. per hour in the case of adult male workers, making the new aggregate minimum rate Is. Id. per hour; Id. per hour in the case of male workers of 18 to 21 years of age ; \d. per hour in the case of boys under 18 ; \d. per hour in the case of women time-workers; and Is. 6d. per ordinary week of 48 hours in the case of girls under the age of 18. Proportionate reductions will be made from the piece-rates established at the various firms. The reductions will take effect at the commencement of the first full pay-week in July.Wagon Builders and Repairers (National).-At a conference held in London on the 15th June, an agreement was reached between the railway wagon builders and repairers, including representatives of the Wagon Builders Association, the Wagon Repairers&apos; Association and Wagon Repairs, Ltd., and the Associated Blacksmiths&apos; Society, the Amalgamated Union of Shipbuilding, Engineering and Constructional Workers, and the Amalgamated Engineering Onion, the Amalgamated Society of Woodcutting Machinists, and the Workers&apos; Union. The agreement provides for a reduction of 6s. per week in the case of time-workers and 10 per cent, in the case of piece-workers, in two equal instalments of 3s. and 5 per cent., respectively. The first instalment will operate as from the 1st July, and the second as from the 1st August, 1921.Sawmillers (Sheffield). Following on negotiations between the Sheffield Sawmill Proprietors&apos; Association and the Amalgamated Society of Woodcutting Machinists, an agreement has been reached for reductions in the wages of machinists of 2d. per hour, which is to take place in two instalments on the first pay-days in July and August, respectively.Agricultural Workers (Various Districts).
