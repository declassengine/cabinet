EGRETThis Document i3 the Property ofHia Brtt&amp;nnic Majeot/3 G .\ jrnmontCABINETCONTROL Off LIQUOR (PRICES AND DESCRIPTION)Memorandum by the President of the Board of TradermmI have formed the ojpinion that there is not sufficient justification for continuing control of liquor prices anddescription after the official date of the termination of the war,The control is embodied in three Orders:-(1) The Beer Prices and Description Order, which fixes maximum price&amp; for the sale of beer....        * * , &apos;. . *(2) The Intoxicating liquor Output and DeliveryOrder, which imposes an average original gravity on all beer brewed of 106l0 in the case of Ireland, and 10440 for the rest of the United Kingdom.(3) The Spirits Prices and Description Order, which mainly operates to fix manimum prioes for whis&amp;y at 300 underproof.SR. I am advised that the maximum prices of beer bend, if anything, to keep up the price of beer against the consumer,and I am not aware that anyone now desires this Order toremain.The restrictions on average gravity were adopted in order-. ito restrict the amount of grain used for brewing at a time when grain was scarce.   They have always involved considerable hard-ship on English brewers as compared with Irish, and as between English brewers individually on those wjio made their reputation by supplying a high quality beer as compared with those who sold a type of beer consumed in &quot;tied&quot; houses.   I understand thit one English firm paid over  60,000 last year to other brewers, ua&amp;er the pooling scheme, in order to secure their unused gravity so as to enable them to produce their standard beer in restricted quantities.   Irish brewers, who still brew up to 10510 as against 10440 in Great Britain, do not require to purchase  unusedgravity/

I am of opinion that the present high duty,combined with the increasingly reduced purchasing power of the-masses, will render impossible any reversion to pre-war gravity levels on beers, and this opinion would seem to be confirmed by the following table for the calendar year 1920kGreat Britain IrelandUnited Kingdom80 far as the spirits duty is concerned, I am impressed by the comments increasingly made by local Benches that it is unfair to control the price of what may be regarded as a luxury article when the prices of the necessaries of life are wholly uncontrolled.    It is unsatisfactory for a Department of State to persist in prosecutions which only result in the grudging infliction of a nominal penalty.  The only justification of the maintenance of the Spirits Prices Order has been the fear that the revenue would suffer if it were withdrawn.  The high duty on spirits will, I imagine, of itself reduce the anticipated revenue now that purchasing power has been reduced, and it may fairly be urged that the way to diminish this anticipated falling off in receipts is to improve the quality of the article sold, which will come to pass when the resolutions of the Parliamentary Conference become effective.Proa an administrative point of view the revocation of this Order on the termination of the war would free us from the necessity of restricting&apos; export, which restriction might be challenged on the ground that whisky is not food.   It would, moreover, save us from a complicated adjustment of scheduledprices /
prices to varying strengths of whisky.    And it would enable me to abolish altogether the Enforcement P.ranch of the food &quot;Department and thus effect a savinf, of  20,000 for the remaining period of its possible existence.For these reasons 1 ask for authority to revoke the Orders affecting the control of liquor under the Ministry of Pood Continuance Act.S.B.
