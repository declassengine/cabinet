SECRET.Afghanistan.&quot;nrr.v*?&quot;^vl)s%    (&apos;ii:cLM.a&apos;n:i) uv the Secretary of State for India.if ALLJ^r-The situation is as follows :-By a telegram of 11th May (see page t)&apos; the -Government of India were instructed that Sir II. Dobbs&apos; tirst objective should be a treaty excluding the Bolsheviks from Afghanistan altogether. Mis Majesty&apos;s Government would have infinitely preferred not to contemplate the alternative which which would leave the Afghans free to receive a subsidy and munitions from the Bolsheviks as well as ourselves; but they were prepared to acquiesce in it in the last resort if the Government of India &quot;remained convinced that it is better to conclude such a treaty than to have no treaty at all &quot; ; and even this pis (dler was to be conditional on disclosure of the Bolshevik treaty and refusal of Bolshevik consulates on the Indian frontier. Negotiations proceeded on this basis, and on 11th Jame the Afghan Foreign Minister informed Sir H. Dobbs that &quot;Afghanistan lias finally decided to trust British assurances&apos; &quot; and completely break off political relations with Russia.&quot; The difficulty of finding a formula that would save the Amir&apos;s face regarding the tribes-a point to. which the Afghans attach the greatest importance-was surmounted, and on 27th June Sir J:l. Dobbs handed in our final proposals. The Afghan representatives 11 were even more than usually polite in demeanour,&quot; but Sir H. Dobbs mistrusted their attitude and had the feeling that there were &quot; difficulties ahead.&quot; It was not until 14th July that discussions were resumed, when the Afghans developed insuperable objections to our proposal regarding the reciprocal communication of draft agreements with third parties affecting mutual interests. They could not agree to discussion or exchange of views on such agreements, or even to previous intimation of their contents. Sir II. Dobbs stated in writing that we must make previous discussion of these agreements a -sine qua non, and it is not; known what further developments there have been. It should be noted that the raising of this objection, and the announcement of the Afghans that they had decided not to apply for admission to the League of Nations, &quot; as they are not sufficiently advanced for the purpose,&quot; followed immediately on the arrival at Kabul of the new Bolshevik agent, Baskolnikov. Since then the situation has steadily deteriorated, and Sir H. Dobbs anticipates a final rebuff on the question of the previous discussion of treaties with third Bowers. 4455-1     100  8.21[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  August 1921.
-)If the negotiations for the complete exclusion of the Bolsheviks break down on this or any other point, the question arises whether we should allow them to lapse altogether and withdraw Sir 11. Dobbs from Kabul, or fall back on the pis alter; and this is the question which I now refer for the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The altitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government has been made quite clear from the lirst they have always realised that they may have to acquiesce in the pis alter ; but they dislike it intensely, and if they are to agree to it, it can only be on the formal assurance of the Govern-ment of India that it is better than no treaty at all. That assurance the Government of India gave on 13th July &quot;our attitude on this point; remains unaltered &quot; but T was so unwilling to accept it as final that 1. put the question again 10 them on the IOth, and they repeated on 22nd : &quot; We are of opinion, &quot;after carefully &quot;weighing political, military, and financial considerations, that &quot;we cannot afford to close the door on it. It is our considered opinion that a &quot;treaty, even on these lines, would be much better than no treaty at all.&quot; In my telegram of 27th July I said that &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government so much &quot;dislike pis altar that they could only approve it after being clearly satisfied &quot;that in actual circumstances necessity for acceptance has arisen&quot;; to which they reply (30th -Inly): &quot;If Dobbs&apos; reading of situation is correct, rejection of &quot;exclusive treaty is now passing beyond region of hypothesis, and we therefore &quot;urge on His Majesty&apos;s Government pressing necessity for passing definite &quot;orders on pis alter.&quot;It is in these circumstances that I reluctantly ask my colleagues to approve the course proposed by the Government of India in their telegram 1943 of 30th July, and circulate accordingly a draft telegram for consideration.E. S. M.India Office,3rd August 1921.
Draft telegram from Secretary of State to Government of India.His Majesty&apos;s Government have considered with the care it deserves the Afghan situation disclosed in your telegrams 1828, 1820, and 1850 ol! -8th July and .1858. of 1st August, and the views expressed by your Government in your telegrams 1843 and 1855 of 30th July.His Majesty&apos;s Government agree with you that there is no halt-way house between exclusive treaty and pis idler, and nothing has happened to diminish, their extreme reluctance to acquiesce in latter. But in my telegram of 11th May, 2431, they informed you that if, in the event of negotiations for an exclusive treaty breaking down, you were to tell them that you still remain convinced that it is better to conclude such a treaty than to have no treaty at all, in the last resort they would be willing to acquiesce. In your telegrams of 13th July. 1071, and 22nd July, 1778, you have given the considered opinion of your Government to that effect,&apos;and you. have based it on considerations arising mainly out of the political, and military situation on the frontier and in the interior of India. I assume that the (Jominander-Iin-Chief shares the. views of the rest of your Government. In any ease, it is the Government of India who are immediately responsible for the tranquillity of India, land if their opinion is that some treaty with Afghanistan is necessary to ensure this, jHis Majesty&apos;s Government have little alternative but to implement the assurance which they gave on 11th May.But in doing so they wish to put before you certain considerations, both general and particular. First, so great are the advantages which the exclusive treaty gives to the Afghans that when every allowance has been made for the psychological, factor it is difficult to believe that in refusing it they are influenced, by mere lack of I perception. Arrival of Raskolnikof and ratification of Turco-Afgban treaty having limmediately preceded Afghan change of attitude suggest an explanation which, if Correct, leads to inference that Afghans will bring to execution of pis adder treaty I same lack of goodwill which led them to refuse exclusive treaty. If that is so, what little value pis- aller may possess in itself will be greatly diminished, and His Majesty&apos;s IGovernnient would be glad to know if you have fully weighed this consideration.As regards particular points in your proposals, (1) His Majesty&apos;s Government, understand that full disclosure of Bolshevik treaty and cancellation of clause in it permitting Eastern Consulates or agencies are absolute sine qua non, and that tribal announcements will not be communicated until latter has been formally executed; (2) they would give no assurance, however modified, of support against Russian aggression and would listen to no Afghan appeals for this; (3) they agree with Dobbs that concessions uoav approved must be final; (4) theyT still attach great importance towTurco-Afghan treaty, especially in yiew4455-3
of indications given in my telegram of 29th July, 3831, and though military power of Nationalists may be diminished, His Majesty&apos;s Government think you cannot afford to disregard them. They think, therefore, that Dobbs should handle this question firmly, asking for explanations of military clauses, and making it clear that so long as Turks maintain their present attitude His Majesty&apos;s Government must regard their presence in Afghanistan as being as much directed against Great Britain as that of Bolsheviks, and he should say that while His Majesty&apos;s Government have-never asked for exclusion of Turks, because they appreciate Islamic sympathies, they will expect Afghans as evidence of good faith to render them innocuous and not to admit them to frontier region from which Bolsheviks are excluded; (5) there must be clear understanding as to Indian anarchists, encouragement and even official employment of whom by Amir is reported. Reference has been made in previous telegrams to Mafiz, who is now reported to have recently received 10,001.) kroner from Soviet Government. If Amir is not prepared to deport these people they should at least not be employed by him, and should be excluded from frontier; &apos;6) while His Majesty&apos;s Government appreciate advantages of time-limit they deprecate any tendency to whittle down real requirements in order to work up to it. (7) His Majesty&apos;s Government agree to conclusion of treaty without ratification provided that full text is seen by them before it is signed.Subject to these remarks His Majesty&apos;s Government approve course proposed in your telegram of 30th July, 1811.). But they expect that Dobbs, in whose capacity and tenacity they have full confidence, will fight to the last for exclusive treaty on basis already approved. Only if this fails will he fall back on pis oiler, trying so to manoeuvre that proposal, shall be made by Afghans, and only in last resort making it himself as a personal suggestion.
(P. 2.1.51)       From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department,llth May 1921.Secret. Afghanistan. His Majesty&apos;? Government have now given the most careful consideration to your telegram of the 5th May. I understand that your view is that the best form of treaty would be one which would exclude the Russians from Afghanistan ; but that if such a treaty could not be concluded, rather than no treaty, you would suggest, in view of the considerations you have brought to our notice, a treaty which would not exclude the possibility of the Afghans getting arms and a subsidy from the Russians.2. His Majestys Government entirely agree with you as to the first alternative. It is eminently desirable that we should administer a diplomatic defeat to the Russians at Kabul ; that Ave should convince the Amir that lie has nothing to gain from Bolsheviks and everything to gain by friendship with us, and that by taking our advice on his relations with foreign Powers he will avoid again getting into a dilemma like the present. We do not believe in the capacity of the Bolsheviks to continue payments of large sums of money. On the other hand, the Amir must kuow that he can rely upon any undertaking we make. In order to get rid of both the Bolshevik treaty and the Bolsheviks themselves, we would agree, and indeed urge you, to go to the very limits of your financial capacity in this direction. We note that you mention 3D lakhs, and that Dobbs suggested 4.0 lakhs annual and one crore initial. Having regard to the present value of money and the comparable cost of tribal warfare, we would urge you not to put too low a limit upon the expenditure necessan^ to produce so desirable a result. Promise him the arms that he wants ; give him every assurance of assistance short of direct military intervention against unprovoked aggression by the Russians, and real friendship if he will give up his treaty with Moscow and dismiss the Bolshevik Mission. We note that you think it impossible lo demand the latter. It is, however, the logical conclusion of the policy which we wish Amir to pursue, and Avhile Dobbs must determine by what means it can best be secured, he will naturally regulate his offer of money, &amp;c, according to the completeness of Bolshevik elimination.3. This, then, is the most desirable course, and no effort should be spared to get it; and, so far as we can judge the situation here, we cannot help thinking that a persistent and firm attitude will achieve success if negotiations are not hurried.4. As regards the alternative, His Majesty&apos;s Government still hold the view expressed in my previous telegrams, the view that you are familiar with from your presence at the Cabinet at which this matter was last discussed before you left England. That India should be paying a subsidy to the Amir, whilst at the same time he had formed a treaty under which he was receiving money^from the Bolsheviks, is a solution which we find difficult to justify, and to which we could assent only with the most extreme reluctance. It opens up unlimited possibilities for the Amir to play us off against the Russians, and the Russians off against us ; applying to each in turn for an increase in subsidy and seeking every opportunity to profit by any dissensions between Russia and ourselves. Whilst Russia is governed by a Bolshevik Government with its known hostility to the British Empire, with its known desire, to wound what they describe as a capitalist Government through the East, the objections are obvious, and even if Russia were once again animated by a similar policy to that which animated it under the Czarist regime, the objections would be equally, if not more, obvious.. We should, therefore, infinitely prefer that such an arrangement should not be contemplated, but His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise that you are thoroughly familiar with these views and that you must have appreciated their force in recommending such a course for our approval. Therefore, if in the event of Dobbs&apos; failure you tell us that you still remain convinced that it is better to conclude such a treaty than to have no treaty at all, in the last resort we should be willing to acquiesce, and we recognise that it is only right to inform you at this stage to that effect. You will, 1 presume, instruct Dobbs to do all in his power with force and firmness to get the exclusive treaty. How far you will take him into your confidence as to possibility of the pis oiler I must leave to your discretion. On the one hand, it is obviously desirable that he should be in full possession of our aims and purpose. On the other, we are so reluctant to assent to the second alternative, and so anxious 4455-2     125  8.21 A
to secure the first, that we do not want to risk weakening his patience or endeavour by too early a recognition that failure does not necessarily mean rupture. There is also to be considered that at Kabul, where everything gets known, the Amir may learn of the possibility of an alternative which may lead him to new bargaining with the Russians.   However, I leave that with complete confidence to you.In all that I have said, I have assumed your intention to be that even the second alternative should be conditional, upon disclosure of the Bolshevik treaty and cancellation of the Consulates on our frontier.In conclusion, we must take care that Amir does not give to Angora the facilities for threatening India which we shall be paying him heavily to refimse to Moscow,, and J should be glad to know how you propose to deal with situation created by Tunrco-Afghan Treaty.(P. 2551) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department,ikhJunc 1921.809 S.   Secret.   Afghanistan.   Following from Dobbs:         -, * First, 151 C., of 3rd June : u Muspratt, Pipon, Navvab and I conferred with Tarsi (? Mohamedi Ahmad Shah),: Abdur Rahman and Amiu-i-Nizam to-day. I informed them of the proposals sanctioned in Secretary of State&apos;s telegram of 30th May. Afghans said they had reconsidered the situation, and wished to point out that they would, by rupture wifcli Russia, lose not only Panjdeh and Russian subsidy, but also other benefits, such as telegraph lines, smokeless-powder factory, 5,500 rifles, held guns, anti-aircraft guns, and 12 aeroplanes, all to be given immediately, and not only in event oi an attack by a third Power. On the other hand, our offer of munitions was only contingent upon attack. Could we not, they asked, promise in addition immediate gifts equivalent to those of Russians, irrespective of contingency? .1 said we could give telegraph materials and initial lump sum of 10 lakhs with which they could buy munitions. (This does not appear to be such a large lump sum as the Government of India said in their telegram of 13th May, 684 S., they did. not wish to give.) I refused to contemplate gift of smokeless-powder factory, and, with regard to aeroplanes, I said they would be useless until aviators and mechanicians had been trained. I had no authority to promise aeroplanes, but if real friendship resulted from treaty it seemed possible that some might be given irrespective of Russian, attacks, and I. would, after signature of treaty, try to arrange this. Afghans seemed to think these offers sufficient to enable them to risk cancelling treaty with Russia. Tarsi said, to my surprise, they did not now see any objection to publication of complete details of treaty.&quot; 2. I then reminded Tarsi that at last meeting he had said that, if there were no treaty with Russia, there would naturally be no Russian Legation at Kabul, and asked in what form he thought an understanding to this effect could be recorded. He replied that he had reconsidered this point also, and believed that, so long as there were no actual war with Russia, she would claim to retain her Legation. For Afghanistan to demand withdrawal of existing Legation would be a provocative act almost certainly leading, to war, and inconsistent with our stipulation that Afghanistan shall not provoke Russia. To promise formally exclusion of Russian Legation would also be irreconcilable with Afghan independence. But if there were merely peace, and neighbourly relations between Afghanistan and Russia without Russian subsidy, &amp;c, British Minister would be in such a preponderant position as to make presence of Russian Minister innocuous. I said that such voluminous information has reached us of Russian bad faith that the exclusion of consulates alone can no longer satisfy us, and that we can only offer help on the scale mentioned in the event of there being no regular Russian Legation at Kabul. I could not, however, shake them from their position.&quot;3. Tarsi then said that he still anticipated that elimination of Eastern consulates would cause rupture with Russia and withdrawal of Russian Legation, but there was, of course, possibility that, after stormy protest, Russia would accept elimination of consulates, and still make treaty withdrawing all or some of benefits offered. He had not yet approached Surits on the subject, and must decline to do so until he knew precisely what we would do in this alternative. He could not at this advanced stage demand serious alteration in tho treaty, unless he knew precisely what we were prepared to do in every contingency.   If Surits did
eliminate consulates we would, lie said, have gained all that we originally asked for, especially as Afghanistan would allow no Russian of any kind, private or&apos; official, within the prohibited Eastern zone. Afghanistan would expect some compensation for loss or reduction of advantages promised by Russia. I replied that, as Afghans had so emphatically insisted that elimination of consulates would infallibly wreck treaty, alternative which they now put forward, viz., pis aller, had not been contemplated, and I could not discuss it. We meet again to-morrow, 3rd June. I shall maintain position that I. cannot discuss, pis alter. But Government of India&apos;s telegram of 13th May, 081- S., road with passage in Secretary of State&apos;s telegram of llth May, 2431, beginning with the words &quot; He will naturally regulate&quot; give me discretion to adopt oilers. Government of India would have been prepared for me to go beyond 40 lakhs to secure expulsion of Bolshevik Mission. I am convinced from to-day&apos;s meeting that this cannot be secured unless the Russians themselves withdraw Legation, vide last sentence to my telegram of 24th April, 103 0.&quot; I shall therefore probably tell Afghans to-morrow that we will give 30 lakhs, with assurances already mentioned, if they manage to cancel Russian treaty, and undertake not to receive from Russia any subsidy or munitions, directly or indirectly, but I shall, if necessary, go up to terms set forth, and j. shall not insist on exclusion of Russian Minister or abstention from purely commercial agreement with Russia, including consulates outside prohibited /one. 1 shall also ask for treaty undertaking, which I mooted to-day, that no further treaty shall be entered into without mutual consultation if it affects mutual interests. I am taking this responsibility on, as Surits has officially demanded, in a letter which Tarsi showed me, an immediate interview with Amir for ratification of the treaty, and crisis must be dealt with somehow.&quot;Second, 152 C., of 4th June :--&quot; At the meeting to-day same persons present. I made, after some discussion, following proposals : &quot; (1) If treaty with Russia is entirely scrapped and Russian Minister withdrawn, British Government will give assurances already mentioned, subsidy of 40 lakhs of rupees, initial grant of 10 lakhs, telegraph material from Kabul via Kandahar to Herat, only 1C0 miles being provided immediately, and six aeroplanes after six months, with the contingent gift of munitions already mentioned in the event of unprovoked Russian attack.&quot; (2) If all important parts of the treaty with Russia, including Russian subsidy and gift of munitions, are entirely scrapped, but Russian Minister remains, and agreement dealing only with commerce and securing ordinary neighbourly relations with Russia is made, Russian commercial agents being allowed outside prohibited zone, British Government will allow 35 lakhs of rupees, and initial grant of 10 lakhs of rupees and telegraph material as in the first. But as there will be no special risk of Avar between Russia and Afghanistan, British Government will give no assurance against unprovoked Russian aggression, and no contingent gift of munitions.&quot; Afghans at first seemed somewhat inclined to consider these proposals. They then, however, pressed for an offensive and defensive alliance with British, and on my flatly refusing to consider this, retired for consultation. They returned with the following proposals : &quot; Afghanistan will be prepared to bring about entire rupture of relations with Russia, including withdrawal of Russian Minister, if British Government promises subsidy of 40-lakhs of rupees, and immediate gift in any case of all munitions which I had offered to give only in the event of Russian attack, six aeroplanes after six months, and telegraph material mentioned, and further, if unprovoked. Russia aggression takes place, will help with additional money and munitions and also-additional aeroplanes and accessories to the extent deemed necessary by the two Governments after consultation.&quot; Tarsi said if we accepted their proposal they would sign at once, and inform Surits that they would have nothing more to do with Russian (corrupt group) make a clean cut. He explained that they felt great uneasiness about the British contingent gift of munitions, since they would be required for distant Northern Frontier, and if Russia made a sudden attack, Afghans could not possibly get them to their northern troops in time to be of any use. Northern Afghanistan might then be over-run like Belgium, and it would be poor comfort to :bel that eventually British help might
enable them to force Russians back. They could not take grave risks of invasion without immediate gift of munitions, and moral effect of immediate gifts would embolden them to give Russia this slap in the face with satisfaction. If British Government agreed to this, he would force rupture of relations onSurits by complaint of Russian action in Bokhara and Khiva without mentioning consulate question, and Afghanistan would thereafter work hand and glove with the British. Not knowing what view Government would take, I felt bound to say that I thought it unlikely (? British Government) would consider (? this proposal) (? as they) would fear that it would encourage Afghanistan to adopt aggressive attitude towards Russia, and would possibly drag British into war with Russia against their will. Tarsi swore they would not adopt aggressive attitude and reiterated his reasons above given for desiring immediate gifts.(i It was then settled that Tarsi should place my proposals 1 and 2 before the Amir, and we shall probably not meet for two or three days. I said that I should put forward (? later) proposals for (? mutual) consultation regarding treaties with other Bowers.&quot; Government of India will, I trust, consider urgently whether there is any possibility of adopting Afghan proposal. It secures clean cut for which His Majesty&apos;s Government are so anxious at a cost of immediate gift of about 25 lakhs worth of material and annual subsidy of 40 lakhs. But the question, of course, is not whether . this amount is too heavy, but whether Government is prepared to trust Afghanistan with these large immediate gifts of munitions. It must be remein-bered that if we gave Afghanistan immediate gift of 25 lakhs in cash . with unrestricted right of import through India already agreed upon, she would be able to purchase same munitions for herself only with greater delay and difficulty. I can see, therefore, little force iu the argument that it would be dangerous to present her at once with the munitions mentioned in return for enormous advantage of clean cut break with Russia. We must either trust Afghanistan and secure her friendship, or refuse to trust her and lose her friendship, as we have on some previous occasions when somewhat (? similar circumstances) have arisen. Afghan argument of danger of munitions not reaching Northern frontier in time seems to me weighty-. Every day is now of importance, as Surits is pressing hard for ratification, and delay will give new opportunities for intrigue and suspicion. Muspratt agrees with the foregoing.&apos;&apos;In view of urgent necessity for immediate action, and in belief that His Majesty&apos;s Government will be in complete agreement with making treaty on (corrupt group), we have to-day, after consideration in Council, sent Dobbs following instructions :- -&quot; Government of India highly appreciates your admirable handling of negotiations and skill in bringing them to this present stage. As regards Afghan demand for immediate gifts of arms, they feel that it is unduly high and difficult to&apos; justify, seeing that it is, as regards rifles, nearly three times as great as Afghans would have obtained under the Russian treaty, and that it is not easily compre-hensible why Afghanistan should require so large a quantity immediately on the Russian frontier, considering their forces there and considering further our contingent promise in the event of Russian aggression. Hence, if you think it possible and not inadvisable, you should try and bring demands for rifles and Lewis guns down to half. Having expressed these views, which they desire to press upon your consideration, however, the Government of India do not wish to fetter your discretion. They authorise you to (? close) with the Afghan offer for a clean sweep bf Russia, including withdrawal of Russian Minister, in. return for subsidy of&apos; Rs. 40,00,000, plus immediate gift of 10,000 rifles, 100 Lewis guns (or, if absolutely necessary, 20,000 rifles and 200 Lewis guns), 12 mountain guns and 2 batteries of&quot; 18 pounders, -plus 6 aeroplanes after six months, plus immediate gift of 160 miles of telegraph material, and gift as soon as possible hereafter of telegraphic material necessary for Kabul and Kandahar and Herat line, plus promise of assistance in ihoney, munitions, and aeroplanes in the event of unprovoked Russian aggression to extent deemed necessary by the two Governments after consultation. It is assumed, from your silence regarding arrears of subsidy, that this question has been dropped, in view of gift in arms and telegraph material. You will of course do all in your power to render exclusion of Russia, including consular and commercial agents, as complete and as permanent as possible. Russian consular and commercial agents would not be only propagandist media dangerous both to Afghanistan and ourselves, but obvious sources of constant friction and misunderstanding between us.&quot;
(P. 2551)       From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department,llth June 1921.29.10. Your telegram dated the Oth June, 800 S. I should be very sorry by intervention at this stage to impede in any way progress of negotiations at Kabul, to satisfactory conclusion of which at an early date I now look forward. But I would ask your attention to position in*regard to Afghan-Keinalist treaty. You have not replied directly to last sentence of my telegram dated the llth May, and I do not know precisely what instructions you have given Dobbs on this point, but last paragraph of your telegram dated the 23rd May showed that you shared view of Ills Majesty&apos;s Government as to possible dangers. Dobbs report of 4th June showed that he had reserved liberty to put forward further proposals regarding treaties with other Powers than Russia,- but i do not gather what exactly he had in mind, and I note that your instructions to him of 0th June did not refer to the matter. Question is, I realise, difficult, but I trust you have been able in consultation with Dobbs to devise some solution.(P. 2640) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department,12th June 1921.857 S. Secret. Afghanistan. Following from Dobbs, 162 0., of llth June :  &quot; Tarsi sent Abdur Rahman and Amir-i-Nizam to-day to say that Afghanistan has finally decided to trust British assurances and completely break off political relations with Russia. He is preparing statement for AmiYs Council pointing out reasons for preference for British alliance. Break will be engineered over Bokharan and Khiva questions. He desires me to prepare immediately final draft of treaty and of accompanying written assurances.. But the Afghans wish us clearly to understand that the affair must be arranged in four stages :-&quot; First. Signing of the British treaty and (corrupt group)s. &quot; Second. Delivery of munitions on the Indo-Afghan frontier. &quot; Third. Conveyance of munitions to the troops at Herat and Mazar-i-Sharif. &quot; fourth. Afghan refusal to sign treaty with Russia and rupture of Rnsso-Afghan political relations.&quot; They enquired whether British could manage to push up a portion of munitions beyond the frontier through Eastern Persia to Herat. I said that I thought this was out of the question.   Afghans desire to know urgently &quot; (a) Whether we accept this programme and will trust them so&apos;far as to deliver munitions on the strength of their written promise of rupture with Russia, and then wait for some weeks until munitions have been transported to the north before the rupture actually takes place.&quot; (b) If so, how long will elapse before signature of treaty and delivery of munitions either at Torkham or Chaman.&quot; They recognise that they must be delivered in batches, but ask when the first consignment can arrive, and what can be rate of delivery thereafter. Will you kindly inform me regarding this point without delay, as it is one to which Afghans attach, chief importance.&quot; Form of letter which the Afghans seem ready to write is something as follows : &quot; &apos; Although Afghanistan originally desired to enter into political relations with the Russian Government as well as with the British Government, she has now like many other States, owing to recent information as to proceedings of Russian Govern-ment, been forced to the conclusion that political relations with that Government are not for her benefit, and that she can enter only into trade relations with it. She has therefore decided not to ratify the treaty which had been proposed between her and Russia, and to break off political relations with Russia.&apos;&quot; We are to meet on 13th June, and I hope to be able to submit final draft treaty after the meeting. I presume I shall have to give some written.promise about tribes, and should be most grateful to be informed as to whether the proposals put forward in my telegram of the 4th June last, 151 C, are accepted.&quot;   Our comments follow.4455-2B
(P. 2692^ From &quot;Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department,UthJunc 1921.802 S. Secret. Afghanistan. Your telegram of Jlth June, 29.10. We had hoped that your reply to our telegram 729 S. of 23rd May would enable us to formulate definite instructions to Dobbs regarding Kemalist treaty. As it is, we have repeated to him your 2811 of .7th June with all connected telegrams. He is thus in full possession of your views and ours, and we await his proposals. Much will depend on form of clause regarding other treaties we can get inserted in our treaty (vide our telegram 811. S. of 6th June). Whole problem is, of course, extremely delicate and difficult. It would be dangerous for Dobbs to enlarge too much on disinterestedness of His Majesty&apos;s Government in contrast to France and Italy in refraining from snatching bargains from Angora Government (your telegram 2613, 25th May), as in the Afghans&apos; eyes this implies that we are less sympathetic, not merely to Turkey but to Islam, than Italy and France. For us co demand that Afghanistan, should make no treaty with Nationalist Government in Turkey seems impracticable.   To urge that(P. 2(391) From Vieeroif, Foreign and Political Department,lZth June 1921.860 S. Secret. Afghanistan. Our telegram of the 12th June, S57 S. Dobbs&apos; telegram, 162 0., 11th June, has been considered by me in Council to-day. Pro-gramme laid down by Afghans involves risks that we should not, in our opinion, be justified in taking. Nobody can foresee what may happen between signing of treaty and arrival of munitions on Russo-Afghan border. Interval, in any event, would be considerable; it is estimated by our military authorities, in most favourable condi-tions, at six weeks at least. Afghan procrastination, moreover, is proverbial, and every excuse to put off final rupture with Russia might be made full use of. In particular, we have to face the possibility of recrudescence or deepening of Islamic unrest. His Majesty&apos;s Government are in a better position than ourselves to judge whether there is any danger of our difficulties with Angora, which have already excited discussion and uneasiness in India, developing into serious conflict with Turkey. This might affect Amir, or at any rate his people, to such an extent as to make him shrink from rupture with Russia,It is thus clearly in our interest to make Afghanistan^ open rupture with Russia coincide as nearly as possible with our delivery of munitions on the In do- Afghan frontier. Ideal would be to hold them in readiness there, and not to deliver them until Afghan breach with Russia were actually made. We appreciate Afghan point of view, however, though we think that Dobbs should again impress upon them necessity for avoiding all provocative action on Russian border. Hence we recognise that it may be impossible to get them to accept this counter proposal. We recommend, &quot;therefore, that Dobbs be empowered to negotiate for best ten-ins, going as far as, but no further than, following compromise in three stages :-(1) Final conclusion and publication of treaty ; (2) Delivery of munitions on the border ; and(3) Open rupture by Afghanistan, 14- days thereafter, of political relations with Russia.This would involve risk, but we think it.may he taken. Until (3) is complete, Dobbs&apos; Mission should remain in Kabul.Afghan proposals are silent about ratification and publication of treaty. We shall be glad of a very early reply to our telegram of the 9th June, 840 S., on the former point. It is most desirable that ail (? avoidable) sources of delay should be avoided. ,Immediate publication we regard as essential, for the movement of munitions will at once become public property &quot;and give rise to wild rumours on the frontier and in India and Afghanistan.Rifles and ammunition will be delivered frontier within a week, and batteries within three weeks, and this is already being put in hand.We are asking Dobbs (to whom, this telegram is being repeated) to define precisely what is meant by the trade (? relations) Afghanistan contemplates entering into with Russia.   Form of promise about treaty is still under consideration.
would involve risk of wrecking our own treaty. Religious and Nationalist feeling worked up by Bolshevism might be too strong for Amir, even. if he could bring himself to consent. Probably utmost we can hope for is to edit treaty before it is actually concluded.In all earnestness we desire to imprSss upon His Majesty s Government the great desirability (? not omitted) from the point of view alone of the conclusion, and also the permanence of Afghan treaty, of coming to an understanding with Angora as soon as possible, still more of avoiding definite rupture, or at least of postponing it, until we have finally concluded Afghan treaty. Our exclusive treaty may possibly prove severe strain upon Afghan nationalism. It may provoke intensive Bolshevik propaganda against A mi rate, and it is essential, that such propaganda should not be given any religious or other handle that can be avoided. Afghanistan, and especially official Afghanistan, is at present very sensitive to politico-religions agitation in India, and this will inevitably be excited in acute form should our relations with Angora take a definite form (? turn) for the worse.(P. 2691)       From Secretary of Stale, to Viceroy, Foreign Department,m.h June 1921.2988. Your telegram dated the loth June, 860 S. I am very strongly impressed by objections to any interval between delivery of munitions to Afghans and rupture with Russians. Disadvantages of six weeks&apos; interval are very obvious and weighty. On the other hand, interval, of only 14 days seems from Afghan point of view not to go far enough to diminish appreciably danger they apprehend, while from our point of view it not only gives away our main safeguard but introduces fresh difficulties. As I understand position, Ave shall be precluded from taking openly the line that Afghan breach with Russians is the consideration for our increased subsidy. Afghan proposal is to engineer break over Bokharan and Khiva questions, and letter at end of your telegram of the 12th dune, 857 S., is, T understand, intended to be the only published explanation. Publication of treaty itself will not reveal true quid pro quo, and unless and until rupture with Russians takes place, reasons for generous terms of British treaty will not appear. If Afghans carried out promise to break with Russians at end of period, you will appreciate difficulty of defending position in Parliament during interval between publication of treaty and open rupture. And if after publication of treaty and handing over of munitions, Afghans refused to break with Russians, we should be placed in very awkward position. They could point to terms of published treaty and say that they were carrying obligations out in full. Could we then do anything effective either to bring pressure to bear on Afghans or to defend ourselves against criticisms on the one hand that we had made treaty without obtaining adequate quid pro quo, and, on the other hand, if we broke it off, that we were breaking faith with a Moslem State ?On the other hand, publication of treaty including clause regarding Eastern Consulates may perhaps in itself be sufficient to render Afghan break with Russians inevitable. For this reason it seems probable that Afghans will oppose publication before break with Russia takes effect.For all these reasons it appears to us highly desirable that not only delivery of munitions and rupture with Russians but also actual signature and publication of treaty should he simultaneous. I gather that all munitions promised will be on our frontier within three weeks. Could not, a day be fixed accordingly on which whole transaction as above would be completed? Advantages are so great that we hope Dobbs will be able to convince Afghans, and determined attempt should be made to do so before he falls back on what we regard as very unsatisfactory alternative. Are we not right in thinking that grounds for apprehending Bolshevik invasion are in. fact very slight ?I am sure you will inform me at earliest possible date of further progress of outstanding questions, in particular form of promise about treaties, attitude towards Afghan-Kern alist treaty, amnesty to tribes, and retention of trade relations between Afghanistan and Russia. As regards last question, I need not say more than that I agree entirely with view expressed at end of your telegram of Gth June, No. 809 S., and that point must be considered of first importance in view of heavy price we shall be paying for exclusion of Bolsheviks.
(P. 2615)      From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department,19th June 1921.3043. Afghanistan. You are aware that Afghan mission while at Home are-reported to have signed treated with Italian Government. Strong representations have been made by His Majesty&apos;s Government both at Rome and here. Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs on 14th instant explained that, understanding that Afghanistan now enjoyed full sovereign rights, he had received Afghan mission and signed protocol recording desire of Italy and Afghanistan for establishment of direct commercial relations and authorising despatch of Italian mission to Kabul, to negotiate commercial convention. This was in interest of Italian cotton industry, which had been pressing Italian Government to find new markets, and representative-of industry would accompany Italian agent. Buchanan expressed regret that we had not been consulted first and explained that object of our present negotiations with Afghanistan was to reaffirm our predominant political interests. Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs said he had not understood this, but would instruct agent to maintain closest possible contact with British agent aud do nothing except in agreement with him. The only non-political task of mission was to watch activities of Angora Government and Bolsheviks. Buchanan said he did not think His Majesty&apos;s. Government would countenance mission, however harmless, as it would create embarrassing precedent.Lord Curzon in course of general conversation with Italian Ambassador on 12th instant drew attention to independent policy of Italian Government in Middle East and made vehement protest against their Afghan negotiations behind back of His Majesty&apos;s Government. He explained nature of our relations with Afghanistan and said he regarded it as inconceivable that an allied Government, professing to co-operate closely with us in the East, should conclude such an arrangement without reference to ourselves.(P. 281.7) From Viceroij, Foreign and Political Department,25th June 1921.950 S. Secret. Afghanistan. Your telegram of 19th June, 3043. While strong protests to Italy for carrying on negotiations with Afghanistan behind our back in middle of our own negotiations was clearly called for, we cannot disguise our concern at Buchanan&apos;s statement to the Italian Minister for&apos; Foreign Affairs, that he did not think that His Majesty&apos;s Government would countenance mission, however-harmless, as it would create embarrassing precedent.We are not clear how far His Majesty&apos;s Government endorse Buchanan^. attitude, but whole question of foreign relations with Afghanistan, and of foreign representatives at Kabul, is so important that we venture to submit our views on it at once.Afghan policy, on which we are now embarking, is full of promise, but is also beset by difficulties and dangers. These difficulties and dangers will clearly not be over with conclusion of treaty. One obvious danger will be the raising of cry, which Bolsheviks will almost certainly endeavour to raise, that Amir has sold Afghanistan&apos;s independence to the British. Hence the necessity for the Amir to conceal fact that exclusion of Russia is a direct result (not to say the fundamental condition) of our treaty, and to claim it as his own spontaneous action, provoked by anti-Moslem attitude of Bolsheviks. But this danger would become incalculably greater if we-attempted an all-round sterilisation of Afghanistan. It would, of course, be idle to hope that we could keep such attempts secret. Italy, for instance, would almost, certainly be at pains to explain away cancellation of her acceptance of Afghan overtures by putting blame on us. Effect on Amir of such obstruction on our part might be very serious, so serious indeed as to make him malleable in the hands of anti-British party we have always to reckon with at Kabul. But even supposing that Amir still desired to adhere loyally to his engagements, popular temper, especially under Bolshevik stimulus,.might run too high for him, if, after all his parade of Afghanistan^ independence, and the well-advertised progress of Afghan mission through Europe, only results he could point&quot; to were a British treaty and a British-Minister at Kabul.In short, Afghan relations with other foreign Powers and the presence of foreign representatives at.Kabul, so far from undermining our treaty, seem to us (corrupt
group) to (corrupt group) it at any rale in the more immediate future. That intrigue will be the inevitable consequence (V Russians, ? Allies, ? we) may not recognise. But so long as we maintain friendly relations with Afghanistan, our position as primus inter pares will be unchallengeable. II&apos; we attempted to keep Afghanistan a close preserve for ourselves, we much doubt whether friendly relations could be maintained for long. In our opinion, therefore, we should place no obstacle in the way of other Powers, Russia excepted, from sending representatives to Kabul if they so desire. It is quite probable that after a short experience of Kabul they will come to the conclusion that advantages to be gained are not commensurate with trouble and expense and will withdraw them. This telegram was drafted before the receipt of Dobbs&apos; telegram on the subject, 180 C,, dated 23rd dune, repeated in our next following telegram. His remarks constitute strong confirmation of our own views.(P. 2817) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department,25th Jane 1921.951 kS.   Secret.   Afghanistan.   Following from Dobbs, 300 (J., of 23rd June :--.....&quot;It is obvious that certain amount of temporary inconvenience, competition, and intrigue against us must be expected from&apos;any foreign mission to Kabul, whether (? from) Allied or other Powers. But Afghan temperament is so unstable that they will probably soon tire of all foreigners who do not substantially advance Afghan material interests, and foreigners will even more quickly tire of the Afghans. It U impossible for us now to revert to the old policy of excluding all foreign inlluence(s) from Afghanistan, and the utmost that we can hope, if negotiations succeed on present lines, is to exclude certain influence(s) reported, to be hostile, such as Russian and Kemalist. Afghans will interpret any attempt to exclude Italian, Fre/nch or Ministers from other Powers not actively menacing our Indian interests as a subterranean plot to nullify their independence in foreign affairs, and suspicion on this point might easily wreck treaty at the last moment, even if we get over the present difficulty regarding tribes. Worrying as the presence of Italian Mission may be, I trust that, at any rate, if our negotiations proceed, satisfactorily, we may appear to acquiesce cheerfully in its despatch. If, however, obstinacy over the tribes breaks off negotiations and we are forced, to adopt policy of complete aloofness from Afghanistan, with the possibility of ultimately drifting into war, I think we should deny to all foreigners passage through India to Afghanistan, and leave them to find their wav as best thev can through Persia or Russia.&quot;t/ v O .....(P. 288(3) From Viceroy, hrjreign and Political Department,mh June 1921.991.

(P. 3096) From Viceroy, Foreign aud Political Department,Utll July 192J.106G S.   Secret.   Afghanistan.   Following from Dobbs, 202 C, of 9th July :-&quot;Please refer to iny secret letters Nos. U&apos;5 G. and 141 K. of 1st July, regarding possible Afghan plans, and our telegram of 3rd July, 198, regarding definition of Wana Wazir&apos;s territory.   There can be, I think, little doubt that Abdul Hadi has now reached Kabul from Bokhara, and as soon as I am able to give the Afghans reply to their enquiries about Wana Wazirs, they will have before them ail our offers and conditions and first-hand information about conditions in Central Asia.   They may, however, try to protract the negotiations, partly in order to see developments of Anatolia situation, and partly owing to the inevitable reluctance to come to a decision on abandonment of their tribal pretensions and clean cut with the Bolsheviks.   To the Afghans negotiations signify (? beyond question) postponing acceptance of an unpleasant proposition by the counter suggestion of an impracticable One, and further delay may produce all sorts of impossible conditions and dissipate present friendly atmosphere.   Moreover, we have now passed peak of hot weather, and the Afghans, while fairly confident that we should not attack them in the event of the failure of negotiations, dread above all things, especially in the present severe famine conditions, prohibition of cold weather immigration of Powindahs and labourers into India.   If they can protract the negotiations until the middle of September, it will be too late for us to stop immigration, forcible expulsion of scattered immigrants will be impossible, and we shall have thrown away our chief weapon for compelling peace-able evacuation of Arnawai, and for bringing home to Afghanistan immediately extent of her dependence upon India.    There is further danger that Afghanistan, while keeping Mission here, may secretly ratify treaty with Russia and delay informing us until she has strengthened herself with money and arms from Bolsheviks. Or, again, Raskolnikov, who seems to be forceful personality, may make the Afghans change their minds.   Lastly, delay will be very expensive to Government of India, since I. understand that they -wish to keep regular troops at Wana until the conclusion of Kabul negotiations.   All these considerations seem to point to advantage of forcing early decision, and (three corrupt groups) unprecedented scarcity on the frontier, and approach of the cold weather will now make the tribesmen reluctant to give us trouble and expose themselves to blockade.   I trust, therefore, that I may receive an early reply to Afghan query about Wana Wazirs, and may then be authorised, if Afghans show signs of further delay, to inform them that, unless they come to a decision by 1st August, I have instructions, to leave Kabul.&quot;Our comment follows. Abdul iiadi arrived at Kabul, 6th July. Dobbs has been sent information asked for regarding Wana Wazirs, Copies of his two letters will be posted by next mail.   They deal (1) with forecast of various courses Afghans may adopt with regard to negotia-tions; and(2) with suggestions for stopping pisses should negotiations end in rupture.protest has been that Italy acted without consulting&apos; us their ally. Exception has also been taken by His Majesty *s Government to sale of arms by Italian Government, possibility of which, as you know, has been mentioned by Afghans.Grounds for uneasiness in regard to Italian Mission are in my opinion sufficiently strong to make it a matter of satisfaction if proposal is now allowed to drop. Apart from general tendencies of Italian policy vis-a-vis of Great Britain in the East, .1 am disturbed by arms question referred to above. Clause VII. of the draft treaty will, I presume, be understood by Afghans as reserving to Government of India some voice in question of importation of arms into Afghanistan, even if quantities cannot be closely controlled. If we are ourselves to give Afghans large quantities of arms we shall he the less called upon to regard with complacency proposals to import from other countries additional supplies.Subject to these remarks I agree generally in your views as to attitude to be taken towards foreign representatives at Kabul. But I should be strongly inclined to except German as well as Russian representative. Afghans should consider objection to German representative reasonable in view of German proceedings at Kabul during war. We do not know what may have passed between German Government and Afghan Mission during latter&apos;s recent visit to Berlin.
it ( t(P. 3134) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department,&apos; ]3lh July 1921.If Dobbs&apos; premises were correct his conclusions would no doubt follow. If Afghans reject our offer for exclusive treaty, they will doubtless base their rejection very largely on tribal question. This would not only be their most dignified course, it would, be their safest course as it would range frontier tribes on their side. But on our reading of case this would not be their real cause for rejection. We believe what Afghans are (? unwilling) to face is definite break with Russia involving dismissal of Bolshevik Mission, relinquishment of Bolshevik gold now actually in Kabul -awaiting their acceptance, abandonment of what they called &quot; the glorious new policy of alliances with Great Britain and Russia both,&quot; and prospect of Russian retaliation in shape of disruptive Bolshevik propaganda against Ami rate, if not of actual military aggression. We are therefore of opinion that, if Afghans reject large advantages offered under exclusive treaty, it does not follow that they would reject (indeed that they would not invite) reduced offer including same tribal offer on basis of a pis aller treaty. Our reasons for advocating pis aller policy, should the worst come to the worst, are already before His Majesty&apos;s Government, and our attitude on this point remains unaltered.We are, however, entirely at one with Dobbs that we cannot either with safety or dignity allow Afghans to dally with our proposals indefinitely. Unfortunately unexpected departure of Afghan Mission for New York without visit to London may possibly give Afghans genuine grounds for wishing to delay final decision until they -can get into communication with it. Moreover, although we are not prepared to -express view that situation between His Majesty&apos;s Government and Angora Govern-ment will be deciding factor with Afghanistan; we believe that the Amir seeks to -avoid making a treaty with His Majesty&apos;s Government until, it has been established that no hostile action will lie taken by us against Angora.But we agree with Dobbs, that, if the Afghans show disposition to protract the negotiations needlessly, he should give them definite time limit. If they accept our offer for exclusive treaty by that date, well, if they reject it, and if they do not of their own motion revert to pis aller proposals, then we recommend that Dobbs should at the eleventh hour himself revert to them (sic), giving Afghans, however, a definite time limit, say, ten days, within which alone restricted offer should remain open.   If(P. 31.3-.1) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department,\2thJiihj mi.1.071 S. My immediately preceding telegram. Dobbs analyses possible course -of Afghan action in order of probabilities thus (1) Demand for further concession(s) especially for lump sum and evacuation of Mahsud country, followed bv refusal of our terms if we decline to vield over Waziristau.(2) Demand for further concessiou(s) followed by acceptance of our terms, if they see we will not yield.(3) Endeavour to extract further bid from Russia, followed by fresh bargain with us.(4) Intimation, that as their deliberations will take time, Mission should leave, mid Afghan decision would be communicated in writing a polite form of (1).(5) Secret decision to break with us over Mahsud question, coupled with (corrupt group) ratification of Russian treaty, protraction of the negotiations with us for couple of months, pending receipt of Russian arms, aeroplanes, &amp;c, followed by public rejection of our terms, including provision(s) against Eastern Consulates.It will be observed that Dobbs, who regards chances between (1) and (2) as -about even, does not include in his forecast possibility of Afghans reverting to pis oiler proposals. Yet, if they decide to reject our offer for exclusive treaty, we believe this perhaps the most probable line they will take. Dobbs asserts that if they refuse exclusive treaty, they will do so, though greatly attracted by our offer and prospects of alliance with Britain and exclusion of Bolshevik influence, on the definite ground that they are pledged to secure the evacuation of Waziristan. He therefore -argues that reversion to pis aller policy would be useless, as Afghans would d fortiori reject our lesser terms if we still declined to yield over Waziristan.
From Secretary of Slate to Viceroy, 16th July 11)21.356o. Your telegram dated 12th July, 1071 S. The problem with  which we are now faced is one which is not at all easy to decide. On the one hand, we have been very patient in our desire to achieve a Treaty of friendship) with, the Afghans, and it is only natural that we should seek a term to our patience and get a decision, (hi the other hand, it is quite arguable that having permitted so long a time to elapse,, there is no real ostensible cause to hurry things at this particular moment, The governing consideration should be our desire to secure an exclusive Treaty, but we must also take into account the risk of a break with all that it involves and choose in all the circumstances of the case the most convenient moment for such a break, if it should occur. It is largely a matter of Afghan psychology, and I am sure you will agree that Dobbs can best judge as to whether we are more likely to attain the exclusive Treaty which we desire by laying down a time limit immediately and showing that we would not be played with any longer, or by allowing Afghans a little more rope. I approve of his acting according to what he regards as the best course. I agree with you that events in parts of the world remote from Afghanistan, affect the, situation. I most earnestly hope and believe that the risk of our coming into conflict with the Angora Turks is getting less, and this may become clearer in the future. Then, too, you have the principle that there can be no real and lasting foundation for common action by Bolsheviks and Moslems. There are signs that the Turks are seeing this, and, whatever the temptation of the gold now arriving at Kabul, it is the longer view that we must hope will prevail. I need not remind you that in the effort to secure an exclusive Treaty. His Majesty&apos;s Government will only with the greatest reluctance contemplate a reversion to pis oiler. I can only put the proposal before my colleagues when I have received a further definite assurance from your Govern-merit that it is their considered opinion that in existing circumstances, military, political and financial, the pis aller is preferable to no Treaty at all, and the situation must, I imagine, largely depend upon the method of rejection of our exclusive Treaty if a rejection occurs. But surely it is most undesirable that, after rejection of our larger proposals, Dobbs should take the initiative in proposing the less satisfactory alternative. He might provide ail opening for Afghanistan to do so, but it is difficult to see how we could, with any regard for our prestige, go further in bidding for Afghan friendship. 1 feel convinced that you will agree with me that, apart from, comparatively unimportant details, like remission of fines, &amp;c., no further concessions, in respect of tribal policy can well be contemplated.With reference to proposed demand for evacuation of Arnawai, am I right in understanding that Afghans are still occupying a fortified post on the British side of the frontier on Peiwar Kotal ?   If so, what action is proposed in this connection ?I approve instructions to Dobbs reported in your telegram dated the 13th July, 1079 S. I shall be glad to receive full text of Treaty as finally proposed as early as-possible.(P. 3276) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department,22nd July 1921.1778 S. Secret. Afghanistan. We have repeated your telegram of the 10th July, 3563, to Dobbs, with following comments : &quot; What tactics are best calculated to attain our paramount object, which is to secure exclusive treaty, Government of India must leave to your judgment. Secretary of State&apos;s summary of pros and&apos;cons will assist you materially in coining to a decision upon difficult question whether to continue to exercise patience or to try and whetthis is in turn rejected, then there is nothing for it but for Dobbs to come away,, leaving behind the demand lor evacuation of Arnawai.Our action in the event of the demand for such evacuation not being complied with is being separately considered. Stoppage of passes on eve of great Powindah emigration is a serious question which cannot be decided without most careful consideration. Our views on this score will follow as soon as they have been finally formulated.
4455-2I)Afghan appetite by setting time limit within which they must accept our offer. Much, seems to depend on whether or not Afghans have any bona tide grounds for their procrastination, e.g., desire to await a clearing-up of Angora situation. Is there no means whereby you could put this to the test? If you are satisfied that they are wantonly playing for time, then balance seems prima facie on the side of forcing the pace. On the other hand, your proposal that Afghans should be given grace up to 1st August was in part based on understanding that Afghan rejection of our offer and. failure to evacuate Arnawai would be followed by closing of passes against Po wind ah migration. After careful consideration Government of India are unable to accept this suggestion. They appreciate fully force of your argument that, if we have to teach Afghanistan by peaceful blockade how dependent she is on India, our lesson should, be as thorough and drastic as possible. But while we have in the past stopped passes with good effect, we have never apparently attempted to stop them against great periodical Powinclali migration. So overwhelming are forces of nature which prompt this yearly moving to the plains of India, that no (? manifestos) issued against it, whether by the Government of India or the Amir, are likely to be effective in checking-it materially, especially in a year of scarcity like this. It could only be checked by force exercised at many points on the frontier. This, it is true, might secure Aniir&apos;s early submission. But unless submission were secured almost at once, inevitable result would he conflict at the most important points along frontier which might easily develop) into general conflagration. Mere threat to close passes, however, especially if made towards the approach of the critical season, could not fail to have great effect ou Afghan Government, and it is open to speculation whether they would be more perturbed at prospect of the passes being closed before Powindah migration has set in or after, in view of their traditional dread of being entrapped by us into war when Powindahs with their camels are as hostages in our hands. (Government of India are, therefore, led to the conclusion that the closing of the passes at any rate against the Powindahs must be ruled out.On the whole the Government of India are inclined to suggest your taking up some sort of attitude with the Afghaus as this. We cannot understand why they are not arriving at a definite conclusion. What is the cause and how long time do they want? If they lay stress on necessity for deliberations by the Council, you might suggest a reasonable period to cover them. Should they hint at outside causes, you might say you are entitled to know what they are in order to determine whether you are justified in assenting to further delay. There is not much difference between this and the course you yourself recommend. But it seems preferable that we should make the time limit come from the Afghans and not from ourselves.Government of India are again addressing Secretary of State regarding the possible reversion to pis aller in the last resort. It is, of course, possible that Afghans, in rejecting our exclusive offer, may do so in such a manner as to put reversion to pis aller out of the question. But while exclusive treaty is our para-mount aim, Government of India are convinced that the pis aller treaty would be better than, no treaty at all. If Afghans reject exclusive treaty, then next best thing-would be for them to reopen the pis aller of their own. motion. If they do not, and if His Majesty&apos;s Government acquiesces in the Government of lndia&apos;s proposals, you should as usual so manoeuvre matters as to make first offer for reversion to the pis aller to come from them. It is only at the eleventh hour, and in the event of failure to secure this move from the Afghans that the Government of India contemplated your mooting the possibility of reversion to it yourself (corrupt group). Unless Afghan rejection of our offer for exclusive treaty is couched in such terms as to render the pis aller palpably impossible, we are of opinion, after careful weighing of political, military and financial considerations, that we cannot afford to close the door on it. It is our Considered opinion that a treaty, even on these lines, would, be much better than no treaty at all.Afghans have no fortified position ou British side of frontier, they have fortified post on frontier itself, but strictly on Afghan side of it. We have already asked Dobbs to consider whether he cannot induce Afghans to remove this local irritant on the grouud that fortification on and up to actual frontier itself is not customary with civilised nations.   Militarily, we do not attach importance to the matter.
(P. 3277) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department,22nd July 1921.1780 S.   Secret.   Afghanistan.   Following from Dobbs, No. 209 C, of 18thJuly&quot;We had a meeting with Afghan representatives, including Abdul Ifadi, on 14th July, but electric disturbances have delayed transmission. Tarsi said that there had been further discussion in Council on British proposals, and main objection now centred round proposed addition to clause 15 providing for discussion or! agreements with third parties affecting mutual interest. Council, he said, had definitely decided that neither discussion nor exchange of views regarding future agreements could be promised, and that original clause undertaking not to enter into an agreement directed against the Interests of the other must suffice. I argued, as 1 have often-done before, that it is impossible for one Government to guess without consultation matter to which the other Government may take exception as being directed against its interests. But the Afghans pretended to be quite firm on the point, and said that they could not even agree to give previous intimation of contents of future proposed treaties with other Powers. They said that, whatever I might argue, their Council believed that Afghans, owing to their lack of experience, would be outwitted in diplomatic consultation with the British Government, and they must keep their hands free. I repeated and emphasised all the obvious arguments, and finally withdrew,, saying that 1 hoped after reflection they would be able to agree to a formula which would secure what we desire. Since then .1 have in continuation of my verbal state-merits sent an official letter stating that provision for previous discussion of contemplated agreements with third parties affecting mutual interests is a sine qua non, and that 1 hope we may he able to agree upon formula at the next meeting.. Tarsi in the course of discussion said that they had now decided not to apply for admission to League of Nations, as they are not. sufficiently advanced for the purpose. T pointed out that this is an additional reason for disclosure by Afghanistan to us of agreements with third parties likely to affect, mutual interests, since we on our part are bound under covenant of League to publish all agreements.&quot;I hope that Afghans may yield, but it may be again necessary to employ threats of departure before they do so. 1 understand that insistence on provision for previous consultation regarding agreements affecting mutual interests -would now form part of both exclusive policy and of pis alter policy, since, even if we fell back on latter, we could not permit Afghanistan to take the subsidy and other concessions from us, and to make some future secret treaty with Russia or Turkey containing provisions directed against our interests, which she might say, after they became known, she had not realised to be objectionable to us, or might keep) permanently secret, being free from any obligation to disclose them. Whatever may be decision, therefore, regarding pis alter treaty, I presume I am in any event justified in pressing point of discussion regarding future agreements up to rupture.&quot; I am inclined to think that Afghan object in raising this objection is mainly to-gain time till (corrupt group) Anatolian situation develops.&quot; Raskolmikov has arrived.&quot;If Afghans really mean business over exclusive treaty, we do not think we should be justified in pressing revised draft of clause 15 on them to point of rupture. In order effectively to exclude Russia, we require, even with revised clause, supple-inentary written admission that any Afghan treaty or understanding with Russia would necessarily affect our interests, and must, therefore, be referred to us for prior agreement. Original draft of clause would be equally suitable for public purpose(s), and, if hacked by similar supplementary written admission, equally effective for practical purposes. Indeed, we should be even better off if Afghans could be induced to run over wording of clause and admit that any treaty or understanding with Russia would be directed against our interests, and. therefore, barred under the clause. If, therefore, Dobbs fails to secure their acquiescence in revised draft, and if he is satisfied of the genuineness of Afghan objections to it, we recommend that he should seek solution on these lines. If possible he should endeavour to legislate against Turkey at the same time, but this is a-matter which we dare not press too far (vide our telegram of the 13th June last, 862 S.).We do not think that we should add to complications by considering exclusive treaty and pis oiler together. For one tiling, objectives of the two are different. For another, we do not yet know how-far Afghan objections to clauses under the exclusive treaty are genuine, or simply-devices to put off day for announcing decision, and to-
lead up to lit) a I non possnmus attitude. Clauses under pis allcr should, therefore, he reserved for decision on their own merits, jl and when revision (? sic reversion) to it should unfortunately be forced upon us.Crux of the whole problem is whether or no Afghans are in earnest. It is possible that course of negotiations will soon enable Dobbs to form a definite opinion on this vital point.(P. 3322) From Secretary of Stale to Viceroy, 27th -July 1021.3777.

I agree with you that crux of whole problem is whether Afghans are in earnest, and I cannot but feel that Dobbs&apos; last report raises serious doubts on this point. What plausible explana-tion is there other than Bolshevik influence for Afghan decision not to apply for admission to League of Nations ? And if Afghans were genuinely desirous of friendship is it conceivable that they would make serious difficulty over proposed addition to clause 15 which is so obviously reasonable in view of special relations which treaty will create between Great Britain and Afghanistan? Objection alleged by Afghans, and their procedure in bringing up this point at this stage as their main difficulty, do not strike me as honest. I suggest that Dobbs might draw Afghans further on question of League of Nations, pointing out that it is iu the interests of Asiatic countries to participate as early as possible in League which may be expected in future to be increasingly influential. As regards clause 15, I cannot see any satis-factory alternative solution along lines you suggest. Original, draft clause postulates not only good faith on part of Afghans, but also capacity of judging what is directed against our interests. I cannot regard this alone as adequate iu the circumstances, and as regards your suggested addition, even if Afghans would agree to supplementary written admission as sweeping as you suggest, it would only cover ease of Russia and would leave way open for equally objectionable agreements with other countries including subsidiary Soviet Governments which Russia uses as its tools. I consider therefore that, for purposes of exclusive treaty at least, we should adhere to Dobbs&apos; intimation that some provision for previous discussion of con-templatecl. agreements with third parties affecting mutual interests is a sine qua non.. It need not be decided for the moment whether this should also be a sine .gua non for purposes of pis alter treaty, or whether in that case we might be satisfied with disclosure of Bolshevik treaty as evidence of good faith. Dobbs need not, therefore, at present regard Afghan refusal to give way on clause 15 as necessarily rupturing negotiations altogether. As regards general question of reversion to pis alter, statement of your considered opinion contained in your telegram No. 1778 will enable me to put your proposal before my colleagues if necessary. But His Majesty&apos;s Government so much dislike pis alter that they could only approve it after being clearly satisfied that in actual circumstances necessity for acceptance had arisen. Much would depend on manner and attendant circumstances of rejection of our larger offer, and rather than submit question hypothetical!)- now I consider it preferable not to propose pis alter for acceptance by His majesty&apos;s Government unless and until choice is definitely between pis alter and nothing. Without assumiug ultimate acquiescence of His Majesty&apos;s Government in your proposals, Dobbs may, however, make it his aim to make proposal for reversion to pis alter come from Afghans in event of exclusive offer failing. If they make such a proposal he would say that his instructions from His.Majesty&apos;s Government Avere limited to conclusion of exclusive treaty, but that he would put before Mis Majesty&apos;s Government proposal for reversion to pis alter.   Decisiou could then be taken by His
Majesty&apos;s Government in the light of! the actual circumstances. I still consider it most undesirable that Dobbs should adopt your eleventh-hour policy of proposing reversion himself. Apart from other objections an attitude on the part of the Afghans such as to make this necessary would almost certainly at the same time make the pis aller completely unacceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government. Utmost 1 think he should do should be to put it forward as purely personal suggestion which he is willing to submit to Government of India- if Afghans wish..As regards Peiwar Kotal please consider effect on tribal opinion if, notwithstanding treaty, Afghans remain in occupation of post established just before war for no other purpose than menace to us.(P. 3381) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department,mil July 192J.1828 S. Following telegram has been received from Dobbs, 221 C., dated 25th July, received to-day, having been delayed by storm:  &quot; Afghan attitude towards us has greatly changed for the worse since arrival of Roskolnikov, and opening of Anatolian campaign, although I cannot say for certain that either of these or both together are real reasons for the change. First sign of the change was attempt of Tarsi to communicate with me by letters from his subordinate clerks, which I refused to accept. He has now verbally admitted to Acheson that he did so to annoy me. Secondly (? reference is made to) various paragraphs in Kabul paper. Thirdly, paper of 23rd July gives glowing account of banquet at Foreign Office on 19th July, attended by incoming and outgoing Russian Ministers, Anatolian and Bokharan Ministers, and puts us with Russian ladies and many other guests. Fervent speeches were made, especially significant being statement by Tarsi, &apos; if the relations of the two States have taken definite shape, it is due to efforts of M. Surits,&apos; and by Abdul Hadi at conclusion of the eulogy of Russia &apos; Dong live the Russo-Afghan Alliance.&apos; It almost looks as if Russian Treaty has actually been ratified, but in any case, publication of speeches is evidently intended as a declaration that Afghanistan will not give up Russian Alliance. 1 sent Acheson to see Tarsi to-day, to ask the reasons for the delay in the negotiations. Tarsi said they were waiting (to) get final decision of Afghan Cabinet on my statement that some arrangement for consultation (? about omitted) treaties with third parties affecting mutual interests was sine qua -non, but he could hold out no hope that their views would change, and he thought we had reached impasse.&apos;4Meeting of the Cabinet had been delayed by Amirs.indisposition, but it would probably take place to-morrow. He still hoped our negotiations might not be entirely fruitless. It is probable, therefore, that 1. shall receive in a few days official letter stating that proposal for mutual consultation is definitely rejected, ft will, be useless in that case for me to propose solution suggested in your telegram 1781, dated 22nd July, since I have already expressed my willingness to accept supplementary letter instead of an addition to clause 15, and have indicated that treaty with Russia is point of chief concern. There seems to be no prospect of inducing Afghans to agree that treaty with Russia of any kind is barred by clause 15 in present form. Your telegram does not even now enable me to act if it is (? approved by Secretary of State) since you express no definite opinion whether some kind of undertaking not to make -tre-ity with Russia, without consultation should be sine qua non of exclusive policy. I presume it must be, since without such undertaking Afghans could make fresh treaty with Russia immediately after receipt of our munitions and breaking off relations with Russia. If I am right in this, refusal to give such undertaking will mean final refusal of exclusive policy. 1 must again impress on Government of India extremely undignified position which we shall then occupy here unless prompt orders are received regarding the adoption or non-adoption of pis aller policy and maximum concession(s) to be made therein vide our telegram of the 24th July, 218.&quot;Our comments follow.
(P. 3370) Front Viceroy, Foreign Department, 2$lh July 1921.1829 S! Our telegrams of 25l.li -Juno, 950 S. and 951 S. Following telegram&apos; has been received from Dobbs, 224 0., 20th July : &quot; My telegram of 25th July, 22.1 0. Papers regarding British protest made in London and Home against Italian Afghan Treaty have just reached me. After careful comparison of dates these papers strengthen surmise already made by Muspratt and myself that our protests were communicated to Afghan delegation, Paris, probably by the Italian Ambassador there, and were reported to Kabul by the mail which reached here on the .17th June. This would amply account for the extra-ordinary volte face of Afghans aud their sudden bitterly anti-British attitude. We may be sure that French and Italians have made most of statement that our contem-plated treaty was act of Government reaffirming our predominant political interest in Afghanistan, and that though Afghanistan now enjoys ostensible independence we still regard her as within the sphere of our political influence.&quot;(P. 3381) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department,mil July 1921.1850 S. Following telegram has been received from Dobbs, No. 218 C., dated 24th July:-&quot; Your telegrams of 22nd July, Nos. 1777 and 1781 S. If, as I trust may not happen, I am eventually ordered to fall back on pis alter policy, it will be essential to avoid further lowering our reputation at the last moment by undignified indecision and delay for the purpose of discussion of scope and limit of this policy. These should therefore be decided immediately before necessity arises. There seem to be two possibilities.&quot;2. First, modified clean cut, set forth in my telegram No. 152 C., dated 4th June, as the second of my offers to Afghans, namely, refusal to accept money, arms or other help from Russians, no Consulates or Agencies of third Power in the prohibited eastern zone, but a Russian Minister at Kabul and Russian commercial agents in the rest of Afghanistan. Under this policy British Government to give initial grant of 10 lakhs of rupees, subsidy 35 lakhs, telegraph material, and assurance against unprovoked Russian aggression in the form of a supplementary letter specifying that assurance only covers case of aggression caused by refusal of. Eastern Consulates. No detailed promise to be made of nature of support offered and no contingent gift of munitions. Tribal concessions would remain as under the present offer, vide (&apos;? para. No. 4) of your telegram of the 13th July (? 10) 72 S., namely, clause 13 as it now stands in the body of the Treaty, plus letter setting forth proposed announcement about Wano Wazirs and Mahsucls. Issue of this announcement would be made dependent upon prior formal cancellation by Afghanistan of objectionable clauses of treaty with Russia, and formal refusal to accept Russian subsidy and arms. Opportunity would be taken to modify Wano Wazir announcement so as to allow for occupation by regular troops (vide your telegram of the 10th July, No. 1060 S. No attempt would be made to get rid of Jemal and Turkish officers who are constantly increasing. With regard to treaties with third parties, I understand it will suffice if I obtain Afghan letter admitting that any treaty with Russia would require discussion with us,&quot; 3. Second policy would be policy (C) in the Viceroy&apos;s telegram of 27th April, 594 S., namely, assurance of support against Russian aggression, limited as above, no telegraph material or munitions to be promised, and exclusion of Eastern Consulates to be insisted on. Russia]] Minister to remain at Kabul and Russian Consulates outside prohibited zone. Russian subsidy and arms to be allowed. Tribal concessions as in para. No. 2 above. Subsidy to be 25 lakhs, or, if I am hard pressed, maximum of 30 lakhs, with initial lump sum of (? 36) lakhs, vide para. No. 5 of Viceroy&apos;s telegram of 27th April, 594 S. Regarding treaties with third parties, full disclosure of Bolshevik treaty, including secret clauses, to be insisted on, vide Secretary of State&apos;s telegram 488, and letter of the same kind as (? required) under para. No. 2 above, to be obtained to provide against future treaties with Russia.&quot; 4. Please confirm this.&quot; 4455-2 13
Following telegram lias been sent to Dobbs, dated 26th July :  &quot; Your 218 0. is under consideration, which will be facilitated by your views on following points : &quot; (1) Under exclusive treaty, do you anticipate that you can clear denial and Turkish officers out of Afghanistan and exclude Turkish as well as Russian, treaty?]&quot; (2) Does modified clean cut consist of excision of clause 10 and supplement from unratilied Russo-Afghan Treaty, and of modification of clause 5 ? Or does it go beyond this ?&quot; (3s) If Afghans reject exclusive treaty do you anticipate that they will excise&quot; (4) With clean sweep of Russians out of Afghanistan under exclusive treaty,acceptance of money, &amp;c, will be attended by some physical difficulty.With. Russian Minister at Kabul, &amp;c, under modified clean cut, would itbe as easy as it seems at first sight ? &quot; (5) If reversion to modified clean cut, or policy 0. is eventually forced on. us,would you rule out consideration of retention of proposed addition to clause 1 of our draft treaty, vide my telegram of 30th May, 1774 S. u (6) Under policy 0,, could we get away from lump sum in whole or under covereither of contemplated increase in subsidy or of telegraph material forKabul-Kandahar ?&quot;Following telegram lias been received from Dobbs, 225 C, dated 27th July&quot; 1. Tarsi promised verbally that if we came to a satisfactory agreement, draft treaty with Turkey would be largely modified, vide para. 4 of my telegram of the 17th. J line, 167, and I had hoped to be able to curtail the activities of Jemal, &amp;c, on the ground of their anti-British bias&apos;; if not to exclude them. Removal ot Russians would have deprived them of support.&quot; 2. In addition to clauses mentioned, Tarsi suggested, at the discussion of 4th June, that the.Afghans would give an assurance that freedom of the Eastern nations, mentioned in clause 7, did not mean that Afghanistan would join with Russia in promoting overthrow of British rule in India.&quot; 3. Under the modified, exclusive treaty I should try for the alterations mentioned under 3, but cannot prophesy Afghan attitude, especially under the shock of developments mentioned in my telegram of the 26th July, 224 C, which have entirely altered situation.&apos; H 4. Afghans could in all circumstances get Russian money into Kabul easily.&quot; 5. Yes. There is no reason why we should incur an indefinite obligation to help Afghanistan against aggression if we get nothing more than the exclusion, of Eastern Consulates. English and Indian public opinion would hardly tolerate such a one-sided arrangement.&quot;6. Suggestion seems perfectly reasonable, but would encounter violent Afghan opposition. I see no reason, however, why we should not make the abandonment of the lump sum sine qua non, and break off negotiations if Afghans do not.;&quot; General. I beg, in any case, instructions as to pis-alter shall be final, and shall not admit of further yielding to Afghan pressure.&quot;(P. 3400) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department,307/i July 1921.1843 S. Secret. Afghanistan. It appears from Dobbs&apos; latest telegrams that he feels that, despite our utmost efforts, there is now little hope of Afghans accepting exclusive treaty. It thus becomes imperatively necessary to take fresh stock of situation. We are very alive to the great objection(s) His Majesty&apos;s Government entertain to a reversion to pis alter, especially as Dobbs is also obviously greatly opposed to it. Although we ourselves would naturally prefer to adopt high-handed attitude towards this petty State, and leave her to extricate herself as best she may from the tangle she lias got herself into, dispassionate review of the consequences convinces us that we cannot afford to do so. We must look ahead, not merely to the probability of very serious deterioration of our already disturbed frontier, though this is a factor which weighs heavily with us, but also and perhaps even more to our
future policy in regard to Afghanistan tan. If we quit Kabul without a (? any) settlement whatsover, what would be our future! objective? Could we reasonably hope that Afghanistan, with the Bolsheviks left in sole command at Kabul, would sue for au exclusive treaty three or six months hence, even if we ran risk of precipitating matters by closing passes against Powindahs? We believe that, while Afghanistan might he forced by tins proof of her essential dependence on India to sue for pis allcr, nothing short of another Afghan Avar and utter defeat is likely to make her accept an exclusive treaty, after her definite rejection of our friendly offers. Another Afghan war would be a severe drain upon our resources, adding seriously to our internal difficulties. Moreover, we doubt whether we could bring another Afghan Avar to a successful close without disrupting Am irate and providing Bolshevism with the anarchy after which she (sic) is striving to reach and threaten India.These are, in brief, the grounds on which Ave hold that in the last resort reversion to pis allcr is forced upon us, unless, indeed, Afghans themselves put it out of court. Offensive though recent Afghan manifestations may seem, especially in contrast vrith our high hopes under an exclusive treaty, they should not be allowed to cloud our judgment. It is only in accord with. Afghan pyschology to convey in a round-about manner an unpleasant decision which they shirk conveying directly. We feel that to attempt at this stage a modified clean cut, as suggested by Dobbs, Avould merely expose us to rebuff. If, as seems probable, Afghan rejection of exclusive treaty is based on determination to brook (?no omitted) impairment of absolute independence, any proposal open to same interpretation would invite same answer. Unless, therefore, Dobbs has good grounds for holding the contrary, Ave recommend that he should confine himself to the pis allcr, manoeuvring Afghans into making first move on lines of your telegram of the 27th July, 3793. Afghan Governments instructions to Wali Muhammad to proceed to London and arrange for a Minister to be left behind postulates definite intention, at any rate up till quite recently, to have treaty arrangements with us. Indeed, if our generous offers fail to induce them to exclude Russia, it seems to follow that they will shrink from excluding India, on whom they are so much more dependent.As regards pis alter itself, our recommendations are these : Dobbs, at the proper moment, should present Afghans with actual draft, giving them definite time limit (say 10 days, but definition should be left to Dobbs&apos; discretion) in which to accept or reject it. He should insist on disclosure of Soviet treaty in full as evidence of good faith, but should take his stand solely on expunging of Eastern Consulates, not because they are in reality much more dangerous than Soviet Minister at Kabul, but because &apos;(1) we have throughout taken  the line that they are purely anti-British in design;(2) they can be so denounced on Afghans&apos; own admissions ; and (3) both in England and in India they have been publicly described as being the (? main) obstacles.To cover possible whittling down of Russian concession over Eastern Consulates and in view of the decreased purchasing power of rupee he should set subsidy at 25 lakhs. If he is hard pressed (but he should bear in mind criticism of the Treaty will he strong on this point; he should go up to, but not beyond, 30 lakhs. But in view of increase to subsidy and to mark our reluctance to resort to pin alter he should rule out initial lump sum (representing arrears of&apos; subsidy). Instead, he should offer telegraph material from our borders to Kabul and on to Kandahar, as it is obviously desirable that this should not be provided by Russians.If time limit is to be short and adhered to, it is obvious that our offer must be shorn of all controversial matter non-essential to our interests.As Russo-Afghan Treaty would be of the nature of a fait accompli, and as we should be apprised of its contents it seems unnecessary to jeopardise the pis alter by insisting on written admission providing for prior reference to us of future treaties with Russia, and Aviser to content ourselves Avith clause 15 as it stands.We agree with Dobbs that proposed addition to clause 1 should be &quot;dropped. Though it would constitute open declaration of our special position in Afghanistan, it would involve us in liabilities which with existing public (? clamour for) cutting uur commitments would arouse severe criticism and be difficult to justly (? justify) in vieAV of scanty assets to which we could publicity (? publicly) point in the treaty. Our inclination is against giving Afghans an assurance in any form against Russian aggression. If Afghanistan and Russia have come to an understanding before Afghanistan in a treaty with us excludes Eastern Consulates, then the limited 4455-2 F
assurance suggested by Dobbs would be of no practical value for the purpose specified, but might be embarrassing to us as a serious liability without adequate return and because of its (? secret character). If, on the other hand, Afghanistan agrees to exclude Eastern Consulates without prior understanding with Russia, and if Russia takes umbrage and resorts to hostilities, Afghanistan would be compelled to turn to us for assistance, and here would be our opportunity for exclusive treaty.But this contingency seems to us most unlikely. It is of course conceivable that Afghanistan may be so uncertain of Russian attitude over Eastern Consulates that Afghanistan may really require an assurance from us as a condition of making the agreement. We scarcely think that this can now be the ease. But if it is, we must discuss it when it (? arises).If Dobbs&apos; reading of situation is correct, rejection of exclusive treaty is now passing beyond region of hypothesis, and we therefore urge upon His Majesty&apos;s Government pressing necessity for passing; definite orders on pis alter. We also ask for authority to empower Dobbs to conclude pis oiler finally, without ratification, after its full contents have received His Majesty&apos;s Government^ approval. The authority hitherto given extends to exclusive treaty only. It is undesirable that Dobbs should be kept in Kabul while ratification is under discussion, or should come away without a treaty finally concluded.We shall be as much disappointed as His Majesty&apos;s Government if we are forced to drop from our high expectations to these very modest proposals, but pressure of facts seems inexorable.From Secretary of Slate to Viceroy, Foreign Department,29th July1921.3831. Very Secret. Report by Karakhan, President of eastern section of Bolshevik foreign affairs, on situation in Near East went to D.I.B. by mail of 21st. It is not known at present to whom or for what purpose it was written. Further enquiries are being made. Report states that centre of political events in next few months will be transferred to Moslem colonies of Entente Powers. It describes Russo-Afghan relations as having been near breaking down owing to Afghans attempting to negotiate mutually exclusive agreements with Turkey and Russia at the same time. This was found to be due to British intrigue, and danger has been averted. Angora Government, by its skill in exploiting conflicting interests of Entente Powers has obtained very strong position, while its contact with nationalist bodies in Moslem countries makes it the administrative spiritual centre of movement of oppressed natives from Kile to Ganges. Particular importance is attached to Turco-Afghan Treaty, and Afghan policy has fundamentally changed since it was signed on 25th April. It has so tied hands of Afghan Government that there can be no question now of change of foreign policy, and has annulled everything British had achieved, and creates situation seriously menacing British rule in India. Any aggressive action by British against Turkish nationalist army or active assistance to Greeks can be explained by Turks as declaration of war which will be immediately followed by Afghanistan taking direct action against Great Britain in India Avhere a rising will immediately break out.(P. 3400) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department,mh July 1921.1855 S. Secret. Afghanistan. My immediately preceding telegram has been, repeated to Dobbs with following addition : &quot; Government of India are very reluctant to lengthen your stay in Kabul. But risks inherent in complete rupture with Afghanistan are such that they could not contemplate without gravest concern door being closed on policy C which you advocated and pursued with such skill at the opening of negotiations.&quot; Tribes all along the frontier are eagerly expecting treaty to put an end to present uncertainty, and there is the continued occupation of Amawai. If there.is a rupture, nothing we can say will prevent Amir from making fullest capital out of announcement that he has broken with us over the tribal question, and has rejected our unparalleled offer sooner than break his word with the tribes. Quite apart, therefore, from machinations of Bolsheviks, who would be left with clear field for intrigue, this alone would be bound to cause widespread unrest along our borders. Where we have trouble already, as in Waziristan, it would be intensified and the
0 iim *contagion would certainly spread, In the Khyber, in particular, wo should have to be prepared for intense agitation over the railway. If the Afridi fireproof curtain were to fail general conflagration would be upon us, and all Bolsheviks want at this stage of their campaign against India would have been gained. However loth the &quot;Amir, Afghan war might prove unavoidable.&quot; True, eventful (? eventual) result would he realisation by Afghanistan that she had backed the wrong horse. But; at what cost to India-. Even if Afghan war were avoided, Bolshevism, unfettered by our restraining influence, would be busy at her work of. undermining the constitution. Thus Afghan (? Afghanistan) might; learn her lesson, too late for us to be able to rebuild a stable Government out of the wreckage. Serious reaction of complete failure of our negotiations (? on omitted) internal India is obvious. It would constitute a fresh grievance for Islam, for Amir would,of course, proclaim to outside world that he broke with us over Angora, and our campaign against self-determination ami independence of Islamic nations, Afghanistan and tribes included.&quot; it is, of course, repugnant to have to revert to pis aller at this last stage. But there would be this advantage. If Afghans reject exclusive treaty it will prove that we have been more set on it than they. Under pis aller positions would become reversed. &apos; For over and above substantial benefits they would received (? receive) from us under it, Afghans require treaty with us to set off against their treaty with Russia, in pursuance of their set policy of independence, which is presumably their stumbling block over exclusive treaty. Government of India hope that; this tactical advantage will induce Afghans to revert&apos;spontaneously to the pis aller, and also ensure a swift conclusion to the negotiations, including evacuation of Arnawai. If they do not so revert, it is left to your discretion, if you think it presents a prospect -of success, to make the offer personally, as suggested by the Secretary of State.&quot;(P. 3400) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political department.rtm.cnl,]slAugust 19211858 S.   Following from Dobbs, 227 0. of 30th July :-&quot;After many attempts by Tarsi at evasion, I. insisted on seeing him to-day and led up to question of speeches delivered at banquet to Russians. I asked him whether these meant that Afghanistan had ratified Treaty with Russia. He refused infor-mation, but said that final decision of Afghan Council upon the British Treaty . proposals would be communicated not later than 3rd August, and I should be able to judge from that whether they had ratified Treaty with Russia or not. I warned him that no treaty of any kind with us would be possible unless Afghanistan disclosed fully and precisely state of her relations with Russia, and told him I could not wait longer than date mentioned. I said that unaccountable delay, coupled with demon-stration in favour of R ussia at the Foreign Office banquet and anti-British paragraphs in newspapers, had rilled me with suspicion regarding Afghan decision, and only very frank explanation could dispel those suspicions. Tarsi hinted that speeches at the banquet were intended to throw dust in Russians&apos; eyes. I also referred to public -anti-British speeches by Turkish officers at; Herat reported in Seistan Consulate diary for week ending 2nd July, and said that these showed the spirit in which officers engaged under the Turco-Afghan Treaty were apparently being invited into Afghanistan, and threw light on the intentions of the Treaty itself. Afghans pretended to be much, perturbed at news of these speeches, and said that, if true, those who made them would be dismissed. Afghans showed themselves depressed at the news from (? Anatolia), which may have unexpectedly chastening effect. I can do nothing more until 2nd August. If Afghan attitude then points to Treaty with Russia having been (corrupt group), and Afghans refuse to make definite statement on this point or to communicate the contents, I. see nothing for it but for me to leave Kabul, &quot;without further delay.&quot;Following sent to Dobbs to-day : &quot;Your telegram 227 C. Government of India quite realise that nature of. Afghan communication on the attitude adopted by Afghan Government may make it-definitely impossible for you to remain, in which case you should leave Kabul without delay. But in absence of conditions rendering it essential for you to leave imme-diately, Government of India trust that you will understand that they would expect you to report to them for orders before you left Kabul.&quot;
