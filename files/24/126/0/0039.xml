They are abandoning political action and devoting themselves to undermining the Unions from inside,   The Labour Party is about, to launch a campaign in anticipation of a General Election.The tour of H.R.R. the Prince of Wales in Lancashire has been an immense suooess. */Both in Great Britain and Ireland there is a burning hope that the Irish negotiations which begin to-day may bring about a lasting peace.
THE COM, MINERSReports from practically every coalfield agree in one particular:   the men are glad to he at work again and profoundly dissatisfied with the terms of settlement.   Since %ho last negotiations no efforts at explanation appear to have been made and the belief is almost universal that there will be a very heavy drop in wages when the  10,000,000 have heen spent.In South Wales there is a good deal of local trouble and the men allege that there have been oases of victimisation: my correspondent thinks that when they have a few weeks1 pay in hand, they will strike in various districts;   the disputes at tho Garnjooh, Tirdonkin and Tirpentwys Collieries are not yet settled.La Iianoashire and Cheshire most of the miners:are expected to have work in three or four weeks.   Pits at Great Harwood, A3tley and TyIdesley have, however, been-permanently closed; about 500 men and boys are affected1.   i?lie&apos; lodges have imposed a levy on all the men who have work for the benefit of theremainder.Work is being resumed gradually in.the Northumberland and; os   -     i la . .&quot;\ &apos; a ted l  -a/ m helDurham area, but there have been several disputes regardingthe signing on of men.   Most of the,Yorkshire, pits are working and there seem to have &quot;been very few hi tehee Vl considerable interest is taken in the Hedges - Aolett quarrel.In the Midlands d i s satis fact i on 13 evident, but the men now realise the folly of allowing the pits to be damaged and are blaming the extremists accordingly.   There ia the same feeling in Pifeshire.About 7,000 Nottinghamshire miners are stilliunemployed and there are frequent allegations of victimisation.Notices have been posted in several: anarkahire pits to the effect that work will cease for the Pair holidays from July 15th - 27th.   Only about 55$ of the miners have been able to start and many will have to remain idle for,months.In all the coal mining districts there haB been a rush to register for unemployment benefit.   -THE 00MMDNI8T8Apart from manipulation of the &quot;Free Speech&quot; agitation,the/
the communists have for the time being practically abandoned political activity and are devoting their attention to industrial matters. Among the miners they are particularly active and as many of the men are disgusted with their leaders they are meeting with some success: in the Clyde area communist propaganda has materially affected the ballot of the engineers and shipy? joiners. Special attention is also being paid to the agricultural workers, who are not, however, fruitful soil for communist propaganda: large quantities of leaflets are being circulated, 4,000 having been sent to each of the two Scottish divisions of the party.

There are, however, signs that all is not well with the party leaders: Dick Beech, who has recently been to headquarters, has sent the following account of his visit to a friend:

"I had a find? proposition ? this dept, but couldn&apos;t get nothing done, in fact it was impossible to find anyone, the would be leaders with their directive ability were directing things for some celles (?) I suppose.&apos; A dummy staff at H.O. to whom I wouldn&apos;t have gave a job to, licking stamps, were managing things, &apos;or trying to&apos; it appeared to me that the rest had all got the wind up, well they fed me up. I had a hell of a row, told a few of them my candid opinion of them and that was, they were not capable of running a hen farm. I resigned from the E.C. also the Party and also the job I had, told them to get some one else, as I refused to except any more instructions from a gang of politicians of this type etc."

As Beech has for some time been in charge of the courier service at Hull, his resignation will inconvenien? the party: it has not yet been possible to ascertain who will replace him, but McDonald of Glasgow, has just been selected for some important work, which may be connected with Beech&apos;s resignation.

Branches and districts are running very short of fu? and headquarters do not seem inclined to help, except in the case of the Glasgow branch to which they are now making an allowance of Â£10 per week for the payment of unemploye?
unemployed members who are to act as propagandists, in additionto a grant of  50 to moot tho expenses of the two divisionalcouncil meetings.   It is, however, probable that the lackof funds will be remedied when delegates return from the moscow Congresses.   Such money as is passing from headquartersto provincial officials is being sent in the form ofmoney orders, postal orders, or Treasury notes, a procedure which renders detection of the source practically impossible.The Coventry communists have arranged a &quot;Convict Sunday&quot;for July 17th, when a mass meeting will be addressed byDingley, Jackson, Shopperson, Socol and Josson, all latelyreleased from prison.   Most of the Coventry branch of theNational Union of Ex-Service Men Joined the Defence 3?orcein April and have now agreed to join the local communist partyen bloc,   my correspondent states that most of. these men boastthat they possess revolvers.   H. Wabb, a member of theProvisional Executive of the Communist Party, has boon in coventry for a week!s propaganda;   he is a particularly recklessspeaker and said at one of the branch meetings:&quot;Where are your Red Guards?   Why haven11 you a Company formed like other branches have ... I should like to see it formed, and I will be responsible for finding the instructor.   Comrades!   How would &apos;it be for us, in conjunction with the Workers1 Committee movement, to form our Red Guards, and seize control of the factories. Why not Coventry City as a jumping off ground for the Soviet Republic   Truly a good place for a start, with its factories and workshops.    Get into the Army * the Navy and the Police Foroe, snd preach communism to your acquaintances from morning to night ... The revolution must be a bloody one.     If Inkpin fails to win his appeal and goesvto prison, meetings of protest must be held up and down the country, and the Bed revolution must be preached in the Harket Places and in every hole and comer.&quot; , &quot;Leicester branch is in a bad way financially and numerically but Eottingham and .Mansfield are active;&apos;the members being, for the most part, miners.Iii Birmingham the Communists are coming to grips with the moderate leaders and there was considerable disorder at a &quot;FreeSpeech&quot;/
Speech&quot; meeting of the Trades and labour Council in the     \ Town Rail on July 10th.   The council had agreed with the Public Works Committee that only,certain people should be allowed to speak end that no protest, should he made against the recent local prosecutions; communists were present in force, led by Brain,and interrupted the proceedings through Brain, who is one of the Midland representatives on the national executive, has a considerable local following and has become the idol of the &quot;rebel&quot; element.The Edinburgh branch of the Communist Party reports a membership of 50: 38 meetings were held in June, mostly&apos;    in the Lothians, 160 doaen of &quot;The Communist&quot; were sold,.......   I- ., &apos;   . 1&apos; &apos; &apos;   * &apos;7 39 copies of the &quot;Communist International&quot;, and other literature to the value of  1.14.6.   Collections amounted to&apos;  10.7.4J-. and expenses to  25.13.4-1;.   Tne amount paid to headquarters as levy was  1.5.0. for the month and.as,this i a comparatively large branch, it is obvious that the income of the head offioe from legitimate subscriptions is out of: all proportion with the expenses: the salaries traced so far&apos; -alone amount to.over  150.a week. :THE RMJrM uiilOKIN-ri-REATIOUAli       &apos;&apos; \,J r  The. first- congress pf the.&apos;Red-&apos;-Trade Union International is: now in progress at Moscow&apos;and Lovovski, the general secretary, announced that the movement embraces seventeen million organised workers.   (This is, of course, a gross exaggeration).   A British delegate, whose name has not yet been asoertained,/delivered the following peroration at the opening session:i ,\ . ,fA,:far-reaching -change of &quot;heart has permeated&apos; -     the English working class.   Toilers are growing eve . -more eonaoio-us- that class-warfare is inevitable and that proletarian dictatorship is a necessity.&quot;The/
vIOSCOW AID TEE CO-OPERATIVE OTgGeorge Peet, the corresponding secretary of the British Bureau of the Red Trade Union International,.-&apos;haa received .   the following letter, &quot;No. 106&quot; dated,Moscow Hay, 86th, 1921, from the &quot;Bureau d!Initiative de:L1Internationale des Co-operatives, Moscow&quot;! ,. .   .;&quot;We hereby beg to inform you that, the. Internationa: Council of Trade and Industrial Unions by/mutual agreement with the Communist International have,decided to convene a Conference of the representatives *of all countries on the subject of Co-ope utives in July next in Mosoow.&quot;Enclosed please find the general themes treating the International Co-operative Centre, as expounded in the manifesto.&quot;It/&quot;The eoonomio crisis is revolutionising the British workers swiftly.&quot;For three months the valiant miners pursued their struggle alone, after having been abandoned by their leaders.&quot;England is rapidly being transformed from a country with a Conservative Labour movement to a land of revolutionary conflict.&quot;Tne &quot;British Bureau is in communication with extremists in most of the Continental-countries* chiefly with a view to the exchange of literature; but at the same time, efforts are being made to link up the Reu Trade union movement in Great Britain, G*m&apos;n$t Switzerland, Holland&apos;, Italy and Scandinavia.   Ian Maopherscn, in London, is in charge of this work, which he conducts in quite remarkable French.Since &quot;The Worker&quot;, which was the organ of the Clyde Workers&apos; Committee, has   been taken oyer. by the National Administrative Council of the Workers&apos;,Committees there has been considerable friction among tiie, Glasgow Beds, culminating In a quarrel which has caused;.the,, resignations of 97. Gallaqher and .X.U. Uesser.
&quot;It is therefore of the highest importance that amongst the delegates appointed for the journe; to Moscow to participate in the Congress of the International Council of Trade and Industrial Unions there should be several workers w.*io are acquainted with the Co-operative movement,&quot;Kindly transmit our invitation to the corresp ing organisations; wo entreat you to render us all available assistance in order to bring to a crowning issue tho work relating to the organisation of an International Co-operative Centre.&quot;All expenses connected with the organisation o this Centre will be borne wholly by the Central Unic (Centre-Soiouse).1 1 &quot;Waiting your early reply by wire, are remain-.. - Yours FaithfullyMember of the International Organising Bureau of Co-* operatives: &apos;J. Eosovsky:&apos;J Secretary:   Kramaroff.Accompanying this letter is a statement by G. Krimirt secretary of the &quot;International Co-operative Bureau&quot;, urg the immediate organisation of an international of the co-operative movement.   The orthodox leaders of the co-operai are attacked in the manner made familiar by Red Trade Unic literature and extremists are asked to form revolutionary nuclei or &quot;cells&quot; in all societies. This movement will al certainly be boycotted by the existing British co-operatic directors, but the extraordinary progress made by extremis last year&apos;towards the capture of the co-operative machines (they were defeated by four votes at the annual congress) will make tt necessary to watch this new Soviet plan carefully.f&apos;   &apos; UNMPLOYMEUT &apos;From the provinces my correspondents report a decreasi in unemployment, but it is doubtful if. this is more than e phase due to the shortage of fuel caused by the miners&apos;stoppage/
stoppage:   conditions generally are such that acute unemployment next winter is not unlifcely.   Meanwhile there are signs of effervescence, due in pert no doubt to the heat, among workers who have been unemployed for some months.   In London, where there is a good deal of hardship, extremists are trying to arrange demonstrations and marches and speakers are urging that the only cure for unemployment*     &quot; * &quot;       .t .,vv i x v&apos;       &apos;     fr&quot; ,&apos; &quot;.is the overthrow of the capitalist system.On July 11th a mass demonstration organised by the London District Counoil of Unemployed was held in Eyde Park; contingents marched from various parts of London arriving at the Park between noon and   p.m.; one was composed of about. 500 women who had come from Eoxton and the rest of men,   The women remained in the Park where they held a meeting, while the men marched through various West 2nd streets and then returned to the Park: the deputation had meanwhile interviewed the Minister of Labour to protest against the reduction of the dole to 15e.   Speeches were made in the Park by W. P. Watson of Wood Green, Lyle of Battersea, and White of Camberwell.   Lyle said that he believed that it was the duty^ of every unemployed, especially the&apos;married men with wives and children depending on them, to become morally criminals and ignore the law and help themselves to save their respective families from starvation in this land of heroes.   He believed   it was impossible to exist honestly on lfs. per week, therefore there was no alternative but to become moral criminals.   This man was a very poor speaker and had the effect of driving the listeners into the shady parts of the Park.      The deputation subsequently returned to the Park and announced that they had had a very courteous reception from the Minister of Labour but that he could not promise any alteration in the dole owing to the financialstate/
mm)    Q    tmstate of the country.    Other speakers stated that the only course open to the unemployed was to appeal to the Board of Guardians for poor relief and &quot;thereby make up the 5/- taken away by the Government.&quot;Unemployed demonstrations have ;een reported from West Bromwich, Smethwick and V/olverhrmpton:   in these, as in many other districts the communists are exploiting the workers and their activity is cut of all proportion to their numerical strength:   they are preaching class hatred with some ability, and urging that the various events of the London season prove that the country is far from bankruptcy.!4y correspondent states that in Sheffield there are threats of another large demonstration to procure a further extension of the maximum relief grants.On July 5th and July 7th processions of unemployed marched to the Council Chesabers at Middlesbrough and Sunderlan&amp;t there was no disorder but the men!s representatives presented petitio celling upon tho civic authorities to provide relief work.Enquiries show that the recent disturbances at Grimsby were not due to agitators but arose from acute unemployment, anti-Gorman feeling and antagonism to a trawler owner named William Grant.   This man has soveral sons, none of whom served in the war, but he was awarded the O.B.S. for war work, much to the annoyance of all classes, who maintain that in his case the letters stand for &quot;Own Boys Ifccmpted.&quot;   This rendering of the letters was exhibited in the neighbourhood of Grantfs office and the arrival of tho first of tho German trawlers for which his firm has been appointed agents brought matters to a climax.   The demonstration against Dutch and Danish trawlers w due to tho statement of Grimsby fisherman that thoy had seen the Gormans transfer their fish to these vessels at Yimiden.ily correspondent in tho 3ast Midlands states that theris
is a good deal of discussion of the Unemployment Insurance Act among the local workers. They say that the effect of the dole is most demoralising and that the Act does not benefit the proper persons; they also contend that the present contributions will prove a burden to employers and employed and that the Labour Exchange are "Useless extravagances". The men state that employers can rarely obtain the workers they want through the Exchanges and find it much simpler to advertise in a local paper: they further claim that the abuse of the dole is due in no small measure to the fact that employers get people to work at cheap rates because they know them to be in receipt of unemployment benefit.

The imprisonment of John McLean and "Sandy" Ross has noticeably affected the meetings of "unemployables" on Glasgow Green. Their lieutenants are however carrying on to the best of their ability, with smaller audiences, their stock speeches being scurrilous attacks upon the Government.



? PRINCE OF WALES&apos; TOUR IN LANCASHIRE

My correspondent comments on the extraordinary outburst of enthusiasm in Lancashire on the occasion of the Prince&apos;s visit. He was among the crowds in the streets and was struck not only with the sentiment and loyalty but with the real affection displayed by both men and women. He reports that the visit came at a very opportune moment and that it has entirely upset the plans of the revolutionary agitators.



?TREMISTS AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY

A correspondent, who was in close touch with the Labour Movement at Oxford last term, sends me the following report:

"On May 1st a split occurred between the Right and Left Wing supporters in the Oxford Labour Club. A very active individual with a large quantity of hair (called Kelly) has been largely responsible for the break. The reason of the split was a letter which was very &apos;red&apos;, sent to the &apos;New Oxford&apos; and published by them. The whole University was in an uproar about it and there were suggestions of blackmail made in connection with the Editor, Felix/
Felix Morley.   Morley and his assistant Neale (both t whom wore Americans) offered a compromise and this was rejected by a large majority of votes, chiefly female (from tho girl students).    After this there was a fortnight of furious speeches and rowdy meoti Morley and Neale resigned and a new board was formed, The Labour Club was then finally split into two camps and oaoh agreed to help each other fwhere possible&apos;, -  There are now two Oxford Labour papers.A.   The Kew Oxford (now merely the corpse of what it wai7 still exists under a new editorial board, The board consists of Miss Hardy, C.R. Be Gruchy (Jesus), G.J. Smith (Ruskin), S.S. Smith (Ruskin], -  H.V. Ueill (Pembroke).   This advocates apolitical Labour Party and is composed of &apos;moderates&apos;.-B.  The Free Oxford is an entirely new paper which has !    ftit&apos;&apos;f^&amp;voidable reasons1 only been published afti the term finished.     It is a paper which is &quot;!    wholeheartedly red and very similar to theCommunist in its opinions.   It has absurd semi-religious articles by the Thaxted Vicar, Conrad Wool.    It is not financed in any way at present -apfreals^ ostentatiously to undergraduates for fund! support it and the University Left &apos;Ylng.    It -   &quot;&quot;supports and advertises the University Socialist Federation and it has a joint headquarters with t &quot; &quot;-&apos;  ^bdeTetibn at 34. BBClestori Square.   One of its editors is C.H.

Peade of Worcester College, It has felt it necessary to break away from the Oxfori University Labour Federation and it is struggling to establish iVself as firmly in Oxford as it has already/ done in the northern Universities.    It did a great dt in Oxford during the strike last term and is really a much&apos;more vigorous concern than the Oxford Labour Federation, which is only Parliamentary - political.Activities of U.3.F. during strike.April 8th.

They regard her organising abilities as super-human, has organised a large number of meetings in Oxford The result of all this was numbers of leaflets. ; :; several thousands they state, which were distribute to Ireland, England and Scotland and Wales.   They ;;    urged all students not to blackleg the miners.   1-of these were opened and others stopped, together with copies of the New Oxford, before they left England, and this caused everyone concerned in Qrt /        to be wildly indignant.&quot;The first edition of &quot;The Free Oxford&quot; printed by theNational Labour Press at Manchester, on good paper, consistof forty pages, and was distinctly an expensive production.CONVICTIONS/
X - 11 -convictions on July 6th J.H. Binney and CE. Morley, both of Rotherham, were charged with having made speeches likely to cause disaffection among the civilian population at College Square, Rotberham, on June 20th.    Binney was sentenced to six weeks1 imprisonment in the Seoond-Division and Moriey to a fine of  20, or in default one month1 s imprisonment in the Second Division:   he elected to serve the term of imprisonment.    ... ,V On July 7th William Cogan was found guilty at Surrey Assizes of firing five ricks at Mit chain and of attempting to murder a constable end was sentenced to 10 years&apos; penal servitude. r&apos; At Chester Assizes on the same day two Irishmen, named John Kearney and John licPhillips were eaoh sentenced - to six years&apos; penal servitude for cutting telegraph wires between Birkenhead and Chester and for being in possession of fire-arms.   John C. Byrne was sontenced to ^ive years&apos; penal servitude for being concerned in the same offences and Dennis J. 0&apos;Kelly to eighteen months1 imprisonment for cutting wires. ticOn July. 18th- Michael McCann, a scaffolder, and William Whelan, a joiner, pleaded guilty at York Assizes to having in their possession at Middleahorbush a quantity of gelignite:   each was sentenced to five years1 penal servitude. - -   - -   .w . tSINN OMN IN CRS/iT BRITAIN -There has been little surface activity among Sinn Peiners in this country during the week:   on. July 11th the flalham branch of the Irish&quot; Self-Determination League held
- 12 - -    /&apos;/; 1a Dttatijig ^vrtiicVm Idartin^^and mrs. Eva Gore Booth.    About 350 people were present, but nothing of special interest occurred.On July 12th the Glasgow section of the Clan-na-Gael held a meeting to discuss the situation arising from the impendingpeace negotiations.   It is stated that the meeting was held on instructions from Devoy in Amarioa and that the possibility ofwrecking the peaos conference by means of outrages wes suggested,The members are opposed to any meeting between the British Government and the Irish leaders.IRELANDThe Truce and the Conference have evoked intense emotions in Ireland, and it becomes more evident every hour that the people, as a whole, will be glad to accept any terms thalj will relieve them of strife and yet preserve something of their amour nropye.   The majority would be satisfied with something short of a Republic, even with &quot;Dominion Home Rule&quot; if they knew what that meant. .Undoubtedly, de Valera has increased his power and prestige very markedly during the past week and, while the Party of violence is still unconvinced, de Valera seems now to be in the position to treat its opposition with less attention.   It is reported that Michael Collins showed so much distrust of de valera and Griffiths that during the Conference in the Ifension House he had a speoial watch placed upon them and tapped their telephones.   He is not at all opposed to the Truce because it is giving his &quot;Plying Columns&quot; a much needed rest and himself time to improve the arrangements for the importation of arms and ammunition.   special measures are new being taken to prevent the secret importation to Ireland-.... . , .* uOutrages continued up to the last moment.   In remote parts and in Belfast there were riots of the worst kind during the week-end. _^
