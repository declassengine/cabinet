ft     0[TM^fi^Mnent is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;^ Government.]1Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1921,SECRET./MEMORANDUM COMMUNICATED TO M. BRIAND BY LORD HARDINGEON JULY 29, 1921.THE note delivered to the Marquess Curzou of Kedleston by the French Ambassador yesterday has made upon tlis Majesty&apos;s Government a, most painful impression. It is couched in parts in language which must be rare in diplomatic intercourse, ;md rarer still in the relations&apos; between Allies who have only recently emerged from the stress of common sacrifice and common suffering during four years of war, and who in the two and a half years that have since passed have been co-operating, not unsuccessfully, in the scarcely less anxious task of bringing back a stricken world to peace.The note has been submitted to and carefully considered not only by His Majesty&apos;s Ministers, hut by a meeting of the Premiers of the British dominions and the repre-sentatives of India, now in London, whose title to a voice in anything concerning the relations between Great Britain and France, to whose battlefields they contributed many hundred thousands of men, is beyond dispute. The present reply represents their collective views.  -It is with no small surprise that thev have observed that, on the basis of a number of statements and particulars, of which the accuracy cannot &quot;be admitted, the French note sets forth a series of complaints against the action and attitude of the British Government for which there is no warrant whatever, and culminate5in a definite threat that, unless and until they definitely associate themselves with a measure which they are bound to regard as not merely uncalled for, but dangerous, the French Government will refuse to meet them in conference, and that the direct result will be an Anglo-French &quot; conflict.&quot; fSo grave and unprecedented a communication from an ally naturally gives rise to the suspicion that it has been made under a serious misapprehension of the essential factors of the situation. His Majesty&apos;s Government feel it to be incumbent on themselves, in the first place, to set out the facts in their true light.It was on the evening of the 16th July that the French Ambassador communicated to the Foreign Office a note to the effect that, on the strength of information received by them from General Le Rond and the Polish Government, the French Government proposed to send an additional division to Silesia, and that their Ambassador at Berlin had been instructed to ask, among other things, for facilities for the transport of the division across Germany. This happened to be a Saturday. The note was carefully studied on Monday, the 18th, and on the day following the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs replied to it in an interview with the Ambassador, in which he definitely stated that, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, additional troops were not required in Silesia and should not be sent until the matter had been discussed at the expected meeting of the Supreme Council, which he suggested should be summoned on the 28th July.It is therefore quite inaccurate to say, as does the French note, that Great Britain, whilst unwilling to send British troops, had raised no objection in principle to the despatch of a French division. The exact contrary is the case. The objection entertained by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the sending of French reinforcements was repeated by Lord Curzon to the Comte de Saint-Aulaire in a conversation on the 21st July, in which, on the strength of official telegrams from Silesia which he quoted, h3. stated that the situation there was not such as to justify the despatch of further French forces, the arrival of whom at this juncture might have an effect the very reverse of that desired.Two days later, on the 23rd July, in a further conversation, the Secretary of State read to the French Ambassador extracts from another telegram from &quot;the British Commissioner in Silesia to the effect that if there was to be an immediate decision of the Supreme Council more troops were unnecessary, and that if disaster were to be avoided, the sending of an additional French division should be stopped at once.437   [6685]
Furthermore, it is to be noted that the French demand for the despatch of a French division was, as originally reported to us by Sir M. Cheetham, after a conversation with the Political Director of the French Foreign Office on the 17th July, not a demand for its despatch independently of Allied opinion or support, but was contingent upon the assent of the Allied Governments, a condition which would appear to have been subsequently forgotten, but upon which His Majesty&apos;s Government relied all the more readily as it was in entire conformity with the assurance given by M. Millerand to Lord Derby on the 9th April, 1920, and repeated in writing on the 11th April, that, in all inter-Allied questions raised by the execution of the Treaty of Versailles, the French Government bad no intention of acting otherwise than -in accord with their allies.In their present note the French Government declare, not for the first time, that * their demand to the German Government on the 16th July to give facilities for the transport of the troops was based on &quot; the formal demand put forward in the collective telegram from the Allied commissioners.&quot; The only collective telegram of which His Majesty&apos;s Government have cognisance was that addressed on the 19th July to the Ambassadors&apos; Conference at Paris, to whom it was duly communicated in the form of a minute, dated the 20th July, that is to say, four days subsequently to the French demand put forward at Berlin. The French Government would appear, therefore, in their communication to the German Government of the 16th July, to have been acting upon some earlier report, possibly from their own commissioner.The French Government proceed to complain that the reply made by the German Government on the 24th July to the demand of the French Ambassador for transport of troops to Silesia was characterised by &quot;scarcely disguised insolence.&quot; As regards the legal validity of the/pkm on which this reply was based, there does not appear to be any doubt that the German Government were ol strong ground. As to the tone in which the reply was couched, His Majesty&apos;s Government are bound to state that it did not strike them in the same lijjht, nor did it seem to have produced the same impression upon the French Ambassador when he first discussed it with the Secretary of State on the 25th July.Whatever be the grounds on which the French Government justify their view that the immediate reinforcement of their forces m Upper Silesia is necessary, His Majesty&apos;s Government are quite unable to accept the position that the decision in such a matter is entirely in their own hands, requiring no previous understanding with their allies. Such a claim cannot be harmonised with the essential conditions governing the employment of the Allied forces in Upper Silesia. Those forces are placed at the disposal of the Inter-Allied Commission for the purpose of enabling them to discharge the duty entrusted to them under the treaty of ensuring the execution of those of its clauses which regulate the status of the territory..It is true that, in accordance with the arrangements made by the Supreme Council in 1919, the inter-Allied force has been composed in such a manner as to give predominance in number to the French contingent, a predominance reflected in the presidency of the commission being confided to a French general. But it will be remembered that this arrangement was but part of a general plan by which the predominance in the several areas subjected to plebiscites under the treaty was conferred upon each of the three principal Allies in different regions. The fact that in Upper Silesia the majority of the Allied troops and officials employed are French does not, however, justify the statement made in the French note that the Allies have left France to assume all responsibilities and meet all the charges. As regards the charges, they fall not upon any of the Allies but upon the countries to whom the territory in dispute will eventually be allocated, as provided in the treaty. The responsibility remains undoubtedly with the Principal Allied and Associated Powers, on whom it was laid by the treaty, and who could not, even if they would, divest themselves of this burden. If, in the present instance, the French claim to sole responsibility, and consequently to unfettered choice of action, were to be allowed, it would follow that one Ally could, in total disregard of the opinions and wishes of the others, proceed to the military occupation of whole provinces by his own forces, without restriction as to numbers, and without regard to the real requirements of the local situation.By applying this test of the extreme logical implication of the claim put forward in general terms by the French Government, its untenable character is at once revealed. Yet it is in reliance . on such unsound considerations that the French Government wish to deny to their allies any voice in deciding upon the despatch of a French division.   Nay, they go to the length of refusing to their allies the
opportunity of even discussing the matter in the Supreme Council, and they demand the unquestioned acceptance by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the proposition that France, on the mere statement, in this case unsupported by independent evidence, that her forces are in danger, is at liberty, in the exercise of what are described as her sovereign rights, to order what troops she may please to the scene of common action, regardless of the effect that may be produced upon the local situation, regardless of the opinion of her Allies, and regardless of the treaty itself. Further, if this view be not at once and humbly accepted by Great Britain, we are threatened with a breach between the two countries; and this challenge, couched in words which suggest the language of an ultimatum is explained and defended by the suggestion that a refusal on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government to bow to the French demand would reveal Great Britain as standing behind Germany and backing her against France.It would indeed be surprising if His Majesty&apos;s Government did not feel deeply wounded by an insinuation of such an unwarranted character. It is only three days ago that the French Ambassador, admitting as he could not fail to admit that the attitude of the German Government in the question of the transport facilities was technically and legally justified, begged for the Secretary of State&apos;s assistance in extricating the French Government from the difficulty in which they had become involved by their isolated action at Berlin. Not only did Lord Curzon immediately respond to this appeal by preparing, in consultation with the Ambassador, a formula designed to make the German Government, whose action he had categorically declined to support or defend in any way, give satisfaction to France as regards the substance of her demand, but His Majesty&apos;s Government thought they had the right to feel gratified at the readiness with which the German Government on their part in fact met their suggestion.The incident would never have occurred had not the French Government put themselves in the wrong by their precipitate and single-handed action. His Majesty&apos;s Government did their best to render innocuous the false step taken, and as a reward they are now practically accused of standing^ in the position of the instigators of what is described as an &quot; ill-disguised act of German defiance.&quot;This is an accusation which is destitute of the smallest foundation, and which His Majesty&apos;s Government profoundly resent. The attempt to convert the present issue, which is essentially one between the Allies themselves, into an issue between the Allies and Germany appears to His Majesty&apos;s Government to be equally lacking in fairness and wisdom, and to be fraught with dangers which they are reluctant to forecast.His Majesty&apos;s Government would fain believe that the sentiments to which this part of the French note gives expression do not correctly interpret the innermost feelings animating the Government of their Ally.His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot fail, before concluding, to revert once more to the very unusual language in which the French statement of their views has been expressed. In one place in the note we are told that for an Ally to oppose the despatch of reinforcements would be an act neither correct nor friendly. Elsewhere we are informed that the attitude of the British Government, if adhered to, will lead directly to a Franco-British &quot; conflict.&quot; It is not known precisely what meaning or value the French Government attach to these expressions which are of a character usually associated with the severance of friendly relations, if not with worse.- In the belief thai, the French Government cannot have fully apprehended the interpretation that is not unnaturally attached to these phrases by those to whom they are addressed, His Majesty&apos;s Government invite an explanation on this crucial point.The position which has been reached is manifestly one that concerns not France and Great Britain alone, but the whole of the Allied and Associated Powers. It is only by that tribunal that the matter in dispute can he resolved. Nor can it be admitted for one moment that it is in the power of one ally only, by the suspension -or withdrawal of an invitation, to postpone or prevent that discussion. It is imperative that it should be held without further delay. His Majesty&apos;s Government, ,who have already accepted the invitation to a meeting of the Supreme Council at Paris on the 4th August, deferring to M. Briand both as to- the locality and date of the meeting, and as to the enquiries which are to precede it, are prepared to contribute their quota to this discussion in the interests of a common understanding. But they cannot accept the proposition that the discussions of this conference should be anticipated, or its decisions taken out of the hands of the Allies as a whole, by the isolated action of any individual Power.July 28,1921.
