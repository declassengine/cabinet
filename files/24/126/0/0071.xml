532IL I   (This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government)WPRK1M!3 OOllPEiHSATION (WAR ADDITION) ACTS, 1917 &amp; 1919. Proposal that these Aota should bo included in Expiring Lawn continuance Bill.Memorandum by the Homo Secretary *These Aots will lapse six months after the end of the war, that is, at the end of next February, unless legislation is passed to continue them in foroe. The Aots were passed (by agreement with the chief employees&apos; organisations) to meet in some measure the increase in the cost of living during the war and their effect is to increase the compensation allowanoe payable under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts in cases of total incapacity, by 75$.    The 6&apos;compensation ifcts have, fixed 20/- as the maximum limit of compensation, and therefore the maximum compensation at the present time (including the war addition) is 35/-.    When the Act of 1917 was passed, it was impossible to estimate how long the rise in the cost of living would continue after the war, but it was expected that a rapid fall in prices would take place, and it was beoause of this that the duration of the Act was limited to 6 months after the end of the war*    It is clear now that no speedy return to pre-war conditions can be expected and very great hardship will. be oaused if the War Addition Acts are allowed to   lapse-    Further, the Committee which recently inquired into the working of the Compensation Aot has recommended a substantial increase in the compensation allowances and the continuance of the war additions in existing oaGes (par. 108), and the Government are pledged to introduce legislation as soon as the state of business permits.    There is a very strong case therefore for continuing the ,;far Addition Aots for the present, but as the limitation to the duration of the Aots was part of the bargain concluded with the employees&apos; organisations, I have thought right to consult with the chief organisations before submitting any proposals to my colleagues.Sir Allan Smith has been seen  and, on behalf of the Confederation of Associations which he represents, he agreed to the continuance for the present of the Acts.^)^The Mining Association and the Railway Companies Association remain to be seen.     Unless therefore any serious difficulties should arise, whioh I think is unlikely, I should propose that the War Addition Aots should be inoluded in the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill and continued till the end of 1922&amp;   and I shall be glad to have the concurrence of my colleagues in this oourse.E.S./qxt.8J105,
