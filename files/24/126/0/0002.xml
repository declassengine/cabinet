[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;a Government.] - - -v-^i&apos; a frijii     Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1921.Memorandum of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE American Ambassador called upon me at the Foreign Office on the 28th June to place before me a proposition regarding the above question. He pointed out that, while he himself and other prominent American statesmen, such as ex-President Ta-ft (Mr. Harvey was absolutely wrong in this particular), Mr. Elihu Root, and ex-President Wilson (as the well-known action of the latter,had shown), had always held to the interpretation of the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty maintained by Great Britain, other high legal authorities, such as Senator Borah and Senator Sutherland, had taken the opposite view. The exemption of American coastwise traffic from the payment of Panama tolls had forced its way he did not exactly know how into the Republican platform at the recent Presidential Elections, and President Harding had made a statement of the same character by which he was irretrievably pledged. A Bill to give effect to this policy had accordingly been introduced into Congress, had already passed the House of Representatives and had been reported to the Senate.He (Mr. Harvey) had used his personal influence with the Senators to retard its progress; but in a week or ten days&apos; time it would certainly receive the assent of that Chamber, and then the Presidents signature must inevitably follow.The Ambassador, whose attitude struck me throughout as very apologetic, and even somewhat ashamed, accordingly came forward with the proposition, which he said he had originated in a spirit of true amity, that we should accept the introduction into the Bill of a clause extending the same immunity as American vessels were to enjoy to Canadian coastwise traffic. Canada was, he said, the only part of the British Empire which was at all seriously concerned in the matter; and though Canadian traffic through the Panama Canal was at present very restricted, it might assume very large dimensions in the future, when the concession would turn out to be of great value.I at once asked Mr. Harvey whether this was an attempt to buy off our opposi-tion to the proposed volte-face on the part of the American Government, and whether, if we accepted it on behalf of Canada,- this would not be tantamount to an abandonment of the position which we had hitherto maintained and to which he had himself admittedly subscribed. Mr. Harvey somewhat lamely repudiated this interpretation, and persisted in explaining his own action as a friendly step intended to extricate us from a very difficult position, and promising substantial profits for the British Empire in the future.I thanked him for his solicitude, but added that I could express no opinion without consulting the Departments of Government who were concerned. I promised him as early a reply as possible.Arising out of this conversation, I have had the case examined, and now submit the following considerations: A provision similar to that contained in the new Bill for the exemption, of United States coastwise shipping was contained in an Act passed in 1912, and on that occasion strong protests were made by His Majesty&apos;s Government, with the support of the.Canadian and Australian Governments.The main ground on which our protest was based is the provision of article 3 (1) of the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty, which reads as follows: &quot; The canal shall be free and open to the vessels of commerce and of war of all nations observing these rules, on terms of entire equality, so that there shall be no discrimination against any such nation, or its citizens or subjects, in respect of the conditions or charges of traffic or otherwise. Such conditions or charges of traffic shall be just and equitable.&quot;406   [6524]CONFIDENTIAL:PANAMA CANAL DUES.
The principal objections to the exemption of United States shipping are:-(a.) If a large volume of tonnage passes through the canal free of charge, thedues on the ships which continue to pay tolls will tend to rise. (&amp;.) When once coastwise shipping is. exempt we have no security that the definition of such shipping in United States law may not be changed soas to admit of calls at foreign ports, (c.) We cannot well acquiesce without protest in the breach of a treaty provi-sion which guarantees equal treatment to shipping of all nations as wellas to British shipping.The United States Government, under Mr. Taffs Administration, maintained that they were entitled, in spite of the treaty, to exempt their own coastwise shipping. The President therefore signed the Act of 1912, with the exemption as stated above. After this Act had become law, a renewed protest was made by Sir E. Grey, setting forth at length the contentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government. In making this renewed protest we expressed our perfect willingness to submit the question to arbitration.The United States Government, however, maintained the legality of their Act, and showed a strong disposition to evade any reference to arbitration, partly on the ground that, as no one had yet been injured (the canal was, of course, not yet open) no case for arbitration could have arisen.The Administration of President Taft terminated in 1913. President Wilson took the opposite view of the treaty position, and an Act wTas passed in June 1914 repealing the provision for the exemption of United States coastwise shipping.The present Administration have now returned to the policy of the Taft Government, and, though they must be fully aware of our views on the question, they have made no endeavour to secure our agreement before reintroducing the exemption.It is at this moment that Mr. Harvey Comes forward with the suggestion that a compromise might be reached by according to Canadian coastwise shipping the same exemption as is to be granted to similar United States shipping. We are not at present able to estimate what this concession to Canada would be worth. Probably its present value would be small, but it might be worth something in future. The immediate advantage that would follow its acceptance would be the termination of the whole dispute. This advantage appears, however, to be outweighed by the disadvantages, of which the following may be mentioned : From a political point of view there are obvious drawbacks to a proposal by which a section of Canadian shipping would be differentiated from other British shipping, and assimilated to United States shipping. If the volume of Canadian shipping entitled to exemption reached serious proportions it would add, to that extent, to the amount of shipping on the free list for which other shipping would have to pay. According to a letter which I have received from Sir J. Maclay, shipping interests here regard the policy of - the United States Government as a serious threat.  If we compromise on the lines proposed we can no longer protest.The opinion of the Foreign Office and of the Board of Trade is therefore that Mr. Harvey&apos;s proposal should not be accepted, but that we should stand to our position and press for arbitration. The United States will no doubt make every effort to avoid this, but the point at issue is one which appears clearly to come within the terms of our Arbitration Convention with America of 1908, and of Lord Grey&apos;s Peace Commission Treaty of 1914, and we may be able therefore to bring them to it.It may be mentioned that a tentative suggestion for a compromise, either on the basis now proposed by Mr. Harvey or on some other lines, was put forward by the British Embassy in Washington in 1913.The Colonial Office are believed also to incline to the view that Mr. Harvey&apos;s suggestion should not be accepted, but I have not succeeded in obtaining the view of the Secretary of State.I circulate this paper to the Cabinet, who will decide whether the question ought to be brought before the Imperial Conference. I have not so far mentioned it to Mr. Meighen.From the wider point of view the Cabinet will doubtless recognise in Mr. Harvey&apos;s innocent proposal a further attempt on the part of the American Government to draw Canada -within the orbit of the United States.CURZON OF KEDLESTON.June 30, 1921.
