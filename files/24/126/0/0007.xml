Permission to fly the old ensign is given until 1st January 1922.An attempt to prolong the period in whioh it is permitted to fly the old colours was defeated in the reichstag after a heated discussion.1 ism-UhB six esoort gunboats building at Messrs. Patterson&apos;s Yard at Naples are to be inoreased to eight, and will be fitted as minelayers, and for carrying stores in peace time.   These eight Gunboats will thus beoome the eight minelayers budgeted for in the 1921/22 3st^imates, and will oagy 32 mines each.t
The armament remains unohangod.A further contract is being given,, probably to the same firm, for six eseort gunboats:Tonnage 450:    Speed 21 knots:   2500 H.P.:   Oil Fuel:Dimensions 230 ft, X 24 ft. X 8 ft.   To be armed with one 4 - inch and one 2 - pdr. Pom-Pomanti-airoraft.The reason for this change is stated to be the lack of speed of the original escort gunboats.It is not intended to construct any torpedoes for the Italian Navy except at the Naval Torpedo fforks near Spezia; trials have been oarried out with the 21 - inch torpedo.but, apparently, these have not proved very satisfactory as the torpedo filed to obtain an &quot;Effective range&quot; of 10.000 metres. For the present the Italian Navy will probably remain satisfied with the 18-inch torpedo.The Japanese Government have asked permission of the Italian Government to send S.S, &quot;Heimei ilaru&quot;, which is at present detained at Piraeus with Turkish prisoners on board, to an Italian port, pending negotiations with the Greek Government.The Greek Government have decided to institute a Prize Court for the purpose of dealing with contraband seized by the Greek Navy at Smyrna and Constantinople.Greek; Operations.&quot;Benbow&quot; has been sent to Yarimje to support the British advanced patrols operating on the neutral line at the extreme limit of the British area in the Ismid Peninsula.UNITED STATER *TTie U.S. Navy Department have decided on a redistribution-tion of the vessels composing the Atlantic and Paoifio Fleets, and it is anticipated that the changes will be effooted shortly.   Officially these changes are attributed to reasons of economy to be brought about by gradually concentrating the coal and oil burner vessels into separate Fleets, but it is more probable that the movement is primarily dictated by reasons of high policy.It has been apparent for some time past that the Navy Department were considering the concentration of the prinoipal U.S. Naval forces in the Paoific, and it is now dear that they are about to commence giving effect to this policy by a gradual process of redistribution.
It is their intention to pass all new vessels as they are completed into the Pacific for service in that Pleat, the older vessels thus replaced, &quot;being transferred to the Atlantic.In accordance with this policy the &quot;COLORADO&quot; and &quot;UARYLAND&quot; which should be completed this year will be drafted into the Pacific Fleet.The total battleship force to be maintained in full1commission is dependent on the strength of the personnel voted annually.    The personnel to be allowed for the current financial year^apparently only admits of 13 battleships being retained&quot;&quot;in full commission as against 16 heretofore. The obsolescent 12&quot; dreadnought vessels &quot;DELAWARE&quot; and &quot;NORTH DAKOTA11 are therefore &quot;to be paid off, while the &quot;UTAH&quot; and &quot;FLORIDA&quot;, also 12&quot; ships, are to be placed in reduced commission for service as flagships of the European and Asiatic  Squadrons0 replacing the obsolete cruisers &quot;PITTSBURGH11 and J,HUR0N&quot; in that capacity.The following table gives the present and future composition of the Atlantic and Pacific fleets respectively^ATEANTIO FLEET.-   AT PRESENT. &quot; &quot; &quot;  ---jTjM REDISTRIBUTED.All in Full Commission), (All in Full Commission,NAME,guns.

PART II.

GENERAL INTELLIGENCE.

PERSIA.

The British officers are being withdrawn from the Persian Cossack Division which is certain before long to become once more an instrument of Russia.



MESOPOTAMIA.

Two Turks are reported to be actively engaged in spreading anti-British propaganda on the northern border of Mesopotamia, and endeavouring to raise the tribes against us.

The Emir Feisul arrived at Basra on 24th June and received a splendid welcome from the populace.



RUSSIA.

Siberia.

Semenoff is shortly proceeding to Grodekevo. A section of his forces numbering about 5,000 men under General Notcharev, is about to advance on Khabarovsk from Spassk. Ungern will also co-operate with his forces. The Bolsheviks are reported to have sent two Army corps under General Parksy to Siberia to guard the railway and to assist Chita.



GERMANY.

The Bavarian Einwohnorwohr has been dissolved by a proclamation in the official Gazette.

Escherich, the founder of the ORGESCH, has addressed a letter to the leader of the force stating that resistance is useless and resigning his command.



ITALY.

In view of the smallness of their majority (34), on the conduct of foreign affairs, the Italian Government have tendered their resignation. It was reported that the King urged Signor Giolitti to stay, but the latter remains solid with Count Sforza, and refused to re-consider his decision to resign.

It is still suggested that Signor Giolitti will if not at present, in a few months time, return to power,



JUGO SLAVIA.

The Constitution was passed in its final reading on 28th June, by 223 votes to 35.

   
Tho Grown Prince took the oath to the Constitution on 29th June.   flhilst driving through the streets, a bomb was thrown by a man named Stejic.   The examination of the assailant has implicated, amongst others, three communist deputies, who have been arrested.General $ariiigton has arrested fifty-two suspicious characters, mostly Russians, who are sudpocted of trying to raise revolution in Constantinople, arranging terrorist&apos; measures, military espionage and planning assassination.Greek operationsL.The Groeks evacuated Ismid by sea on the night of 27-28th June, and the town was oocupied by small Komalist forces on 29th June.A commission, under General Pranks, has been sent to Ismid and reports that, while there was no evidence of any massacre of Christians, atrocities of an appalling nature were committed by Christian, Armenian and Circassian bands, assisted by drunken and undisciplined Greek troops, while the town was in Greek military occupation.    The Greek troops are retreating towards Yalova, burning all villagos in the coastal area.General Uarington has picketed the extreme limit of the British area in tho Ismid Peninsula, and the Kemalist command at Ismid and the Central Government have been informed that any troops crossing the neutral line will be disarmed.American Petroleum Companies in Mexico have agreed amongst themselves to cease immediately exportations of almost all grades of oil as a protest against /the new Mexican taxation which they are refusing to pay.   The stoppage will seriously reduce the income of the Government who are at present somewhat pressed for money.
