Memorandum by Parliamentary Counsel, coyering DraftThis Bill ia based on the conclusions of the Parliamentary Conference presided over by the Attorney-General.Subject as hereinafter stated, the recommendations of the Conference have been closely followed; although the Bill necessarily includes provisions to meet points incidental to those recommendations to which the attention of the Conference was not specifically directed.Part I provides for the enactment in statutory form of such of the restrictions imposed by the orders of the Liquor Control Board as the Conference considered should be permanently maintained.&apos;Part II makes the necessary provision for the abolition of the Central Control Board and the winding up of its affairs, including provision for the transfer to the Home Secretary or the Secretary for Scotland (as the case may require) of the properties in England and Scotland which are. at present being administered by the Board under a system of direct State management.Part III contains general and supplemental provisions.PART I..M .m mm mm mm mm .-41.     The most important provisions of this Part are those relating to the hours during which intoxicating liquor may be sold or supplied in licensed premises and clubs. 2.     In accordance with the recommendations of the Committee, the hours are the same for on and for off sales, and are to be fixed,, in the case of licensed premises by the licensing
licensing Justices, and in the oase of clubs, by the rules of each individual club, subject to prescribed general limits, namely -On week-days -(l) a maximum in London of 9 hours, and elsewhere of 8 hours.( ) A break of at least 2 hours in the afternoon.(3) The earliest hour to be 11 a.m. and the latest hour to be, in London 11 p.m., and elsewhere 10 p.m., with power, however, for the licensing justices (outside London) to fix for their dis-district -(a) 10.30 p.m. instead of 10 p.m. as the latestclosing hour; and,fb) a time earlier than 11 (but not earlier than 9 ) as the earliest opening hour.On Sundays -A maximum of 5 hours of which not acre&apos;than 2 are to be between noon and 3 p.m. and not more than three between 6 and 10 p.m. 3. pending an order of the Justices allocating the hours in any district, the Bill provides for a provisional allocation of hours.4. The proposals as to hours on Sunday are compll-cated by the situation in Woles and Monmouthshire.   Under the law in force before the war licensed premises had to fte closed on Sundays in Wales (not. l&apos;n&apos; Monmouthsire) Except for the supply of liquor to residents and to bona fide travellers. other -:. was no xFootnote.   The conference did not recommend any absolute limit&quot;on the power of fixing the earliest hour of opening, but such a limit seems consonant with the general spirit of their recommendations.&apos;
restriction on the supply of intoxicating liquor In clubs.Under the orders of the Central Control Board the supply of liquor, both in licensed premises and clubs, was confined to restricted hours, and was limited to supply for consumption with a mealj and these restrictions were applied to Monmouthshire as well as to Wales.The Conference made no separate recommendation as to Wales and Monmouthshire, and under the provisions of the Bill, which are submitted for consideration, the supply of liquor on Sundays, both in Wales and Monmouthshire, is limited to supply, (a) during restricted hours, and (b) for consumption with meals.5.    The Bill gives effect to the recommendations of the Conference so far as these were designed to meet the case of theatre suppers.   It is provided that in &quot;hotels and res-taurants&quot;, as defined, liquor ordered before the final closing time (in London 11 p.m.) may be consumed on the premises for one hour after that time.   This concession perhaps requires some further consideration,   It is at least doubtful whether the needs of a person requiring supper are adequately met, if he has to order his drink before 11 p.m. and, even If this were so, the definition of &quot;hotel and restaurant&quot; adopted by,the Conference (though it la difficult to arrive at a more satisfactory definition) does not cover some of the principal establishments in London to which resort is had for the purpose of supper.   It is questionable whether the supper difficulty in London can be adequately met except by providing that liquor for, consumption with a meal may be served as late as 11*30 p.m. or midnight and consumed as late as midnight or 12.30 a.m.   To this might be added a condition that all bars must he kept closed after 11 p.m.
6.    Clauses 6, 7 and 9provide-teepectively for restrictions on&quot; the &quot;hawking&quot; of liquor, the prohibition of oh-sales on credit, and of the &quot;long pull&quot;, all of which are probably uncontroversial and were agreed to by the Conference.7.    Clause 9 relates to the dilution of spirits.   The recommendation of the Conference on this subject was that the pre-war position should be reverted to.   Perhaps, however, the Conference hardly realised the full significance of their recommendation.   Under tho pre-war legislation spirits were regarded as adulterated, and could not bo sold without notice to that effect, if they rare more than 25 degrees u.p.   Under the orders of the Central Control Board as last revised -(1) the sale of spirits was permitted, without notice of adulteration, at any strength down to 35 degrees u * p.j and(2) the sale of spirits at a strength higher than 30 degrees uipl was prohibited.It is thought that the Conference in making their recommendation had in mind only the requirement under (2). They can hardly have intended, and probably few people would wish, that as soon as the present Bill passes it should be illegal, without notice of aduleration, to sell spirits of a strength lower than 25 degrees u.p., and lthe price alone would render impossible the sale on any considerable scale of spirits at such a strength.   The Bill as it stands abolishes the existing compulsory maximum strength, but fixes 350, as the minimum strength at which spirits may be sold without notice of adulteration.
8.    The Bill finally abolishes the bona fide traveller. The Conference made no definite recommendations to this effect; but as the bona fide traveller has been practically in complete abeyance since 1915 it seems to follow from the faot that no recommendation was made that there was no desire to restore this special privilege.Under the pre-war law, the bona fide traveller was only a Sunday problem, as on week-days there vas no restriction on the hours during the day-tine when a drink could be obtained; but under the hours proposed in the Bill, the bona fide traveller would become an acute problem on every clay in the week.       Any one who is in the habit of ^pending his day more than three miles from, the place where he habitually resides would become a bona fide traveller for the whole day, and exempt from any restrictions as to the hours of supply.The exemption in favour of the bona fi&amp;o traveller has given rise to considerable abuse in the past   -   an abuse which would in all probability be greatly accentuated now, even if confined to Sundays, having.in view the extension which has taken place since 1914 in motor and charabanc traffic on Sundays.9.     The Bill also abolishes finally the special exemption accorded under the old lav; (but suspended since 1915) in respect&apos; of the sale of liquor at railway refreshment rooms to persons arriving and.departing by train.     This was not the subject of any express recommendation of the Conference.      Under the old law this exemption only operated at night and on Sundays; it is submitted that now it would be impossible to allow railway refreshment rooms to keep open all day, at times when other licensed premises are closed, and that such a course would be strongly resented by the licensed trade      It is not in practice possible to distinguish customers who are &quot;arriving or departing by train&quot;.
PAET II.10.   This Part of the Bill provides for the winding up of the Central Control Board and the transfer of the State-managed areas in England to tho Homo Seorotary, and in Scotland to the Secretary for Soot land.11.   In accordance with what is understood to be the in-tention of the Conference, the government authority, in respect of its operations in the State-controlled areas, Will be subjeot to the general law as to restricted hours &amp;c., but it has boon presumed, and the Bill provides, that as long as the Government dontrol -is oontinued, the State will be free in the directly controlled areas -(a) to carry on as hitherto business on its own premises without a licence; and(b) to exclude the competition of private traders;If this is so, it will be necessary to preserve irt the hands of the new authority the powers of the Control Bo^d under the regulations set out in the Third Sohedule. 12.   It ia a question whether the existing power of the Board to accuire new premises by means of compulsory    pur-&apos;    -chase should be preserved; but to preserve them wauld undoubtedly involve the risk of imparting a controversial aspect to this Part of the Bill.   It is, however, the case that owing to difficulties arising from legal decisions, the scheme of State purchase in the Carlisle area has never been  . satisfactorily completed, and unless the power is continued of acquiring compulsorlly the licensed premises in the Carlisle district (quite few in number) which are still in private hands, there is no doubt that the part of the Carlisle district in which these premises are situated will continue to oifer, as they do now, a very unsatisfactory example of the effects of State management,(Intd. ) H.G.psury, S.VuiJuAy 16th, 1921.
