[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. IPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1921.SECRET.CP. blLhZ CABINET.I circulate to my colleagues a letter which lias been signed by the Indian Moslem Delegation, and of which they have forwarded me a copy, in regard to the present position in the Near East.15th July 1021. E. S. M.The 1 tight Honourable David Lloyd George, CM., A/./&apos;., Prime Minister of theBritish Empire, London.Sir,As representatives of India, we consider it our duty to respectfully inform you that the recent events following the Near Eastern Conference in London, have increased, instead of relaxing the tension in India. Before the Turkish Delegates had. arrived back in Angora, before the time of one month given by the Allies to the Turks and Greeks to make their reply to the proposed modifications in the Treaty of Sevres had expired, the Greeks opened a forceful offensive for which they were secretly preparing even when they pretended to be negotiating peace terms with Turkey in London. The Greeks committed unprecedented atrocities upon Muslim men, women and children in the occupied territories. They desecrated sacred mosques and even dynamited the Mausoleum of Sultan Ertougrel. In spite of all the preparations which they had made, and the free supply of money and munitions which they announced to have received from England, they were palpably beaten by the Turks. By this defeat the morale of their troops aud their people was shattered, and King Constantine, who had, at a critical time of the world war, stabbed the Allies at the back, began to make strenuous efforts to make a fresh offensive. It was then given out in British Press, that the British Cabinet was even discussing the proposal of England joining the Greeks against Turkey. Neither the Turks nor any Muslim people can tolerate the rule of the Greeks over &quot; the rich and renowned lands of Thrace and Asia Minor,&quot; which you, Sir, very correctly called to be the &quot;homelands of the Turks,&quot; and to be &quot;predominently Turkish.&quot; The Turks in Asia Minor, therefore, refused to be intimidated, and in utter despair were compelled to look elsewhere for support rather than allow themselves to be dominated over or dictated by the Greeks.When the Angora Delegation came to London, France and Italy expressed their willingness to come to terms with the Turks and treaties were signed by their representatives and those of Angora respectively.In the draft treaty thus signed, Italy went so far as to promise the Turks her support in their regaining Thrace and Smyrna. But England even then did not make any sign that the representations of the united people of India had made any impression upon her in respect of the restoration of Thrace and Smyrna to Turkey. The molestation of Muslim men, women and children by the Greek troops in Smyrna and their firing on the minarets of sacred mosques, which Sir H. Lamb admitted in a telegram, increased the resentment of Indians, because, you, Sir, had yourself said to the Indian Delegation that England ivas greatly responsible for the occupation of Smyrna by the Greeks.The fact of Marquis Curzon&apos;s coming over to Paris to consult with M. Briand for the peace in the Near East afforded some relaxation to the tension of feelings in India, and the people expectantly waited for the reply of the Greeks to the proposal of the Allied Powers. In the meantime public opinion in England made it clear that the English people, for reasons of their own, did not favour the idea of England joining the Greeks. As far as the opinion of the statesmen and public of France and Italy was concerned there was no doubt left that it was against the ambitions of Greece. Yet Greece had the audacity to spurn the offer of mediation by the Allied Powers and decided on the militarist policy of enforcing peace through bloodshed. They have met with their first defeat at Ismidt, but it is announced now in the Press that the whole of the British Mediterranean Fleet is being concentrated at Constantinople,4376     100  7.21
Tho Allies have made it quite clear that while they are willing to continue to remain at; war with Turkey as long as Greece chooses to remain engaged in her military adventures against that sorely-tried &quot;nation which lias been kept almost continuously in a state of war since 1.012, while they will in no way restrain Greece in her policy of bloodshed and even, butchery and will put no obstacle in her reaching iVngora, the Turks will not be allowed by them to cross over the Straits and to carry back the war home to Greece. Under these circumstances, Indians cannot be blamed if they doubt the avowed neutrality of the Allies in the Hellenic war of aggression against the Turks. You, Sir, promised an early evacuation of Constantinople, but now it is being proposed to increase the Allied garrison there.The present situation is causing,great anxiety all over the East. Because of certain political grievances in India, which are well known to you, the situation in India is doubly unsatisfactory and we beg to suggest the steps which in our opinion will go a long way to restore the equilibrium both in the Near East and in India.Now that the Greeks have twice rejected the terms of peace offered by the Allies, the Allies should give up favouring them, and even if the Allies do not now put the same amount of pressure upon the Greeks which they have been putting upon the Turks to accept peace, they should at least leave the Greeks alone to settle with the Turks as best they can, and the Allies should themselves make immediate peace with Turkey based upon justice and upon the pledges given by you, Sir, in 1918, and the declarations made by other English and iUlied statesmen.We consider it our duty to respectfully remind you that the Khilafat of Islam can never be secure unless the 1914 boundaries of Turkey in Europe are restored to the Turks with full sovereign rights of the Turkish nation over its Empire.Once this Moslem question is settled we assure you, Sir, that the atmosphere will become clear, but without a satisfactory settlement of the Turkish question it can never be possible to restore peace in the Near East or in India.We remain, Sir,Yours respectfully,(Signed)     Aoa Khan.M. M. j. M. Chotani.Shaikh M. II. Kidwai of Gadia.8lh July 1921.
