THIS DOCUMENT IN THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT .cabinet HOUSING POLICY. H.303111 Memorandum ,by the Minister of Health.3I have arranged to state the Government Policy on Housing in answer to a Question in the House on Monday next, which will embody the decisions of the Finance Committee of the Cabinet in the form settled by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and myself.There is no doubt that this announcement will create a very large amount of controversy and attack upon the Government;   this has already begun in certain hostile sections of the Press.   While it is possible to justify on financial and other grounds the action we are taking on existing schemes, I must repeat as I have already pointed out in my Memorandum of the 22nd June (CP .3087) that we are not dealing at all adequately with the acknowledged housing needs of the country, which unfortunately were specially mentioned in the King!s Speech on April the 11th, 1919, and stated to be 500,000 houses,a figure which I personally think considerably inflated.I am quite certain that it will be impossible for theGovernment to leave the housing position just where it is, and I am convinced that some further schemes will have to be evolved which I fear must contain an element of State assistance, in order to reduce the housing shortage to reasonable dimensions.Wbile I m not at present prepared to place a definite schemebefore the Cabinet I should like authority to indicate on behalfof the Government - what I have already indicated as my personal view - that the Government recognise that although they have madea very substantial and expensive contribution to the Housing needs   they intend further to explore the whole situation andto/
to ascertain whether It is possible to devise some alternative methods by which the Housing needs of the working classes can be adequately met in consonance with thefinancial difficulties of the nation.I might state that the present Housing programme will still take a very considerable time to complete;this period, I am informed, will extend to some time well over 12 months and this would give time to mature a new policy,A.
