[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1921.SECRET. . ^CP.-3130.CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY OE THE STATE OE IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 11th instant.General State of the Country.Statistics of Outrages.At the time of writing this report twenty-four hours have elapsed since the coming into operation of the truce agreed upon between the Government and the Sinn Fein leaders. So far as information is yet available the conditions appear to have been strictly observed by the forces of both sides, and for the first time for many years Ireland is how enjoying a complete freedom from violence. Whether to gratify their love of dramatic effect or afford, the world a final demonstration of the sinister power under their control the persons responsible for giving the arrange-ment effect on the Sinn Fein side appear to have allowed their gunmen a free hand until the latest moment, and the week-end during which the truce was concluded was one of the bloodiest on record. The murder of a policeman in Belfast at 11 p.m. on Saturday (the 9th instant) was followed by a fierce outbreak of rioting in that city. During the thirty-six hours from the announcement of the truce until the time at which it took effect no less than twenty deaths by violence occurred throughout the rest of the country. In this death roll were included 8 soldiers (5 of whom were murdered while unarmed), 2 policemen (1 a married man of 34 years service in the Royal Irish Constabulary), 6 members of the I.R.A. (killed in armed conflict), and 3 civilians (1 a girl of 15 and another a retired military officer of 70 years of age). The last revolver shot was fired at 11-55 a.m. on the 11th instant at a police patrol in Kingscourt, Bailieboro&apos; District, Co. Cavan and, I am glad to state, failed to find its mark. Apart from the casualties of the week-end, the outrage figures for the week presented no special feature. Fifty-four attacks upon the Crown Forces resulted in 8 fatal casualties (7 police and 1 military) and 28 cases of wounding (22 police and 6 military). In addition 11 Sinn Fein murders of civilians (including 3 ex-soldiers and 1 ex-R.I.C. pensioner) were reported, and 3 attempted murders.Ten unsuccessful attacks were made upon police barracks, and 1 courthouse (Castlepollard, Co. Westmeath) and 2 coastguard stations (Kilmichael, Co. Wicklow, and Morriscastle, Co. Wexforo!) were destroyed.Raids on mails fell from 95 in the previous week to 33, and furnished the only instance of rebel activity slackening during the progress of the negotiations.Arrests for outrages and political offences numbered 57 for the week.Disturbances in Belfast. .The murders of 2 policemen in Belfast, 1 fatally wounded on the 6th instant and the other shot dead on the 9th instant, resulted in the usual consequences of rioting and street fighting between the extreme elements of the Orange and Nationalist populations of the city. The disturbances commenced shortly after noon on the 10th instant, and raged fiercely throughout the rest of the day. The police and military turned out in their full available force and were heavily fired upon by sections of the crowd in the Falls Road and Springfield Road districts. Late[6605]
in the afternoon attacks were made by large Unionist crowds upon the Catholic quarters of the city, and, notwithstanding the efforts of the police and fire brigade, 52 houses were burned and 41 partially destroyed. As the result of sniping by civilians, and of several exchanges of fire between civilians and police, 13 civilians were killed and over 120 were wounded. The only police casualty was one Special Constable slightly wounded. Quiet was restored by about 10-30 p.m., and although a few sporadic outbreaks of rioting occurred the following day, the disturbances did not again attain to serious dimensions. According to the latest reports, the Military and Police Authorities have the situation well in hand, and the annual Orange demonstrations which commenced to-day are proceeding peaceably.Trials of Civilians by Court-Martial.Fifty-three trials of civilians by court-martial were concluded during the week, and resulted in 35 convictions and 18 acquittals. The following is an analysis of the sentences imposed in the cases of conviction: 6 sentences of penal servitude for life. 4 sentences of penal servitude (5 years to 10 years). 15 sentences of imprisonment with hard labour (6 months to 2 years). 4 sentences of imprisonment without hard labour (7 days to 2 years). 6 fines (105. to 10 I).Total  35The 6 life sentences were imposed for shooting with intent to murder, and the sentences of penal servitude for 10 years (2 cases) for the possession of arms and ammunition. The acquittals included the cases of 10 Auxiliary Cadets accused of robbery and looting at Trim, Co. Meath, in February last. Eight other Cadets concerned in the Trim looting charges were convicted and sentenced to terms of imprisonment with hard labour ranging from 6 months to 1 year. The results of their trials dispose of the famous &quot; Trim affair,&quot; which gave rise to General Crozier&apos;s resignation and subsequent allegations. I may here mention that only 4 of the Cadets convicted were among those who were placed under close arrest by General Crozier and that 18 of the Cadets whose services General Crozier proposed to dispense with were exonerated as the result of the preliminary official enquiry, there being no primd facie case against them to warrant their being brought to trial. Among the other convictions was the case of a constable of the Regular Royal Irish Constabulary, who was sentenced to 6 months&apos; imprisonment without hard labour for obtaining goods by threats from a shopkeeper without, payment, and among the acquittals the case of a constable charged with maliciously wounding a comrade in barracks.Internment Orders.The following statement shows the position as regards internments up to the 9th instant: Orders made    ...        ...         ...         ...        ...       3,795Orders cancelled for reasons other than release       127 Releases ordered ...        ...        ...       341- -  468Number of persons now interned ...        ...        ...       3,327The number of persons whose appeals are awaiting hearing is 41.State of the Police Forces.In view of the altered political situation and the cessation of hostilities agree-ment, instructions have been issued suspending recruiting for all branches of the Royal Irish Constabulary pending the issue of the forthcoming London conferences. The names of applicants are being recorded for use in the event, which I hope is now improbable, of it being again found necessary to have recourse to vigorous measures for the repression of violent crime. The following are the usual weekly statements showing the present strength of the Irish Police Forces:

Not the least of the many factors that have contributed to the present favourable situation has been the influence of Irish public opinion, which from the start has been exercised steadily and insistently on the side of peace. For the first time also for several years the Dublin Nationalist Press has spoken with an independent voice, and has dared to express its opinion in advance of the official pronouncements of a secret organisation. That the alliance of the Irish press and Irish public opinion has made itself felt in shaping the present policy of the Sinn Fein leaders I do not doubt, and I regard it as one of the most &apos;favourable omens for the future. Mr. de Valera&apos;s invitation to Lord Midleton and the Southern Unionists to co-operate with him in finding a basis for a settlement on which all parties in Southern Ireland can unite has been abundantly justified by the results. Their action at this crisis has won for the leaders of the Irish conservatism a new popularity with all classes and will enable them to continue to exercise a useful influence in the councils of the nation.H irish Office, S.W.1, July 13, 1921.Regular Force.Strength on the 3rd July, 1921 ......Deaths during week      ... ...          9Retirements      ...        ... ..;          5Resignations     ...        ... ...        67Dismissals or discharges ... ...        16
