The memorandum, which the British Ambassador presented this morniflg to Monsieur Briand, is drawn up in a tone so firm that, were the French President of the Council to reply to it, paragraph by paragraph, in similar terms, the discussion between the two Governments, upon the conditions and guarantees con-tinge nt to the meeting of the Supreme Council called to pronounce the decisions of the Powers on the problem of Ufcper Silesia, would be in danger of re-mailing on the ground of mutual susceptibilities and of losing sigit of its objective, which is to maintain the unity of the Allies vis-&amp;-vis Germany, and to instill into their definite decision on Ufcper Silesia, the character and force of a resolution taken in common.The French Govermeit would like, in its turn, to emphasize certain stages of th6 pourparlers and to rectify a certain number of points in the British note. Following upon repeated and precise reports from General le Rond (who declared that he repudiated all responsibility) drawing attention to the powerlessness of the Conftiission, on account of the weakness of the effectives at its disposal, to disarm the Polish and German insurgents, the provocations and risks towhich
- 2 -which the French troops, In particular, remained exposed, by reason of the maintenance of German effectives in Upper Silesia itself or in proximity to its frontiers, finally the statement that the allied continents would not be in a position to enforce the decisions of the Supreme Council, Monsieur Briand drew the attention of the allied and German Governments to the situation. At the same time, he enquired of General le Rond if his apprehensions and his suggestions were shared by his French and Italian colleagues. She telegrams addressed to London, Borne and Berlin are dated the 14th of July and all refer alike to a d$march* of the British OxargS df Affaires at Paris, who demanded a meeting of the Supreme Council for July 26th. Hie French telegram point out:U to the Allies, the impossibility of the Supreme Council being able to deliberate under the influence of a Polish or German menace, and the necessity of having, especially for the purpose of assuring the enforcement of allied decisions, suf-ficient forces in Upper Silesia;2. to the German Government, the responsibilities incurred on account of outbursts of violence against French soldiers and an account of the maintenance upon plebiscite territory, or in its vicinity, of concealed arms and troops:   no intimation of any kind was made, at this time, to the German Govennient and it v:aa merely stated at Berlin that, &quot;in the case of the despatch of troops, it would be racessary for the German Government to make the necessary dispositions for their rapid transport to Upper Silesia.&quot;    (M. Giarles Laur&amp;nth&amp;ndsd
handed in a note to this effect on the 16th of July, In which it was requested that complete measures should he taken for disarmament, disbandment and dispersal of self protection troops and that &quot;preparatory measures should he taken&quot;(&quot;pr parerM les mesures). with a view to ensuring the rapid transport to Upper Silesia &quot;of such allied reinforcements as might eventually he sent there&quot;)-  Thus the Allies were advised and consulted ahout our demarche.  The French Government had made no isolated intimation to the German Government of the despatch of reinforcements. At the same moment, it assured itself at Oppeln of the opinion of the three High Commissioners.In reply to the question submitted, to the Corn-mission, the telegram of the three High Commissioners arrived on the 19th.  The perusal of this telegram, even If certain lines are subject to misinterpretation, established that the three Comnissioners were in agree-ment at this moment, on the one hand upon the unstable character of the situation in Upper Silesia, which called for the immediate attention of the Allies, and on the other hand upon the desirability of a quick decision of such a nature&quot;*as to prevent further dis-turbance&amp;^rising and, in any case (whether the decision was taken immediately or postponed) upon the urgent necessity of reinforcements.  It was not pos-sible for the French Government to consider that Sir Harold Stuart had appended his signature under a misapprehension.On
* 4 f,On the 20th of July M. de St. Aulaire consulted with Lord Curzon about the French views, when bringing them to his notice.  According to the account of this conversation, which the French Ambassador gave, Lord curzon replied to him that nour suggestion to send allied reinforcements to Silesia had aroused the greatest emotion in political circles and that the British Government would experience great repugnance and encounter serious difficulties in augmenting its effectives; nevertheless, he would not give an absolute refusal but would reserve his decision, which would be pronounced after the results of the deliberations of the Council at Boulogne-sur-mer.&quot;    Upon the request that the British Ambassador at Berlin should be asked to associate himself with M. Charles Laurent in the latter !s representation, the British Minister appears to have raised objections, while declaring&apos;that he would think it over.  He then read telegrams from Sir H. Stuart, which expressed the opinion that reinforcements were not necessary, whils- admitting the possibility of fresh disturbances, as much on the part of the Poles as of the Gernans, demobilisation being equally fictitious on both sides.   Concluding, Lord Curzon once more expressed the opinion that the only way of easing the situation, which he considered fraught with danger, was to convene the Supreme Council without delay.The French government was, therefore, not confronted with definite opposition by the BritishGovernment
Government over the despatch of troops, but by an expression of strong repugnance to this step end of a refusal to despatch British reinforcements.  Nevorthe-less we were in possession of too opinion of the three High OMEdsaioners, expressing on the one hand the sood results which, according to than, to immediate decision would have upon proveiting a breach of the peace, and, in any case, the necessity for the despatch of reiBfor cements f which. In conformity with the French view, were ftaadla-pensable for assuring the execution of the imminent decisions of the Supreme Council as mutch from the point of view of the Poles as of the Germans  The opinion of Sir Harold Stuart on this point was further confirmed by tiie second note, addressed by the High commission to the Conference of Ambassadors, where the Anclo-Italian suggestion malces the abandonment) of the despatch of reinforcements subservient to the reduction of the Inter-allied aoine.  From the Italian side we have encountered &amp; lees definite point of view which drew attention to the impossibility of sending Italian reinforcements, and, whilst oxpressins certain doubts as to the advisability of the despatch of French reinforcements, did not raise any objection still less oppositionIt was under these circumstances that the French Government, on the 22nd July, that is to say six days after the communication of its first telegram to the Foreign Office, considered itself authorised, after consultation with its allies and without a definite expression of dis^nb on their part, to demand, for the first time, formally at Berlin, the indispensable facilities for the transport of a French reinforcementclivisieiy
division to Upper Silesia, and at once informed the Londqn Cabinet of this decision.  The German Government replied, on the 24th of July, &quot;that a demand to transport troops to Iftper Silesia cannot he made by one of the three Powers alone, in its own name, hut only in the name of the three Powers, who jointly safeguard the occupation of Upper Silesia.&quot;  On the 26th of July, it supplemented the reply by declaring &quot;that it behoved it, on its sido, to enquire of the Governmerits interested whether they also claimed the right to send troops to Upper Silesia.B    At the same-time, a press campaign was launched throughout Gerirarv with the object of dividing the Allies, emphasizing British opposition to Frenfo demands and expressing the h.-pe of attaining a great diplomatic victory ever the French Government.The latter believes that London as will as Paris will concur that it would be impossible to accept the situation of Prance remaining in a position so false as to compromise its authority, due to a lack of cohesion among the Allies-  This opinion appears to have been shown by Lord Curzon, wbo signalised it in a manner appreciated at its true value by the CaMinst in Paris,by letting it be known at Berlin that he was not prepared to give advice on the legal interpretation of the Treaty, this question being of a political nature and therefore one to be discussed at the forthcoming Supreme Council. He added &quot;the British Government has no intention of allowing this question to raise difficulties between . the Allies&quot;. Consequent on this demarche the German Government made a third reply to M. Charles Laurentin
in Which they declared that they had w intention of treatirg this question from an exclusively legal point of view and that in view of the imminent meeting of the Supreme Council the German Government did hot hesitate to declare &quot;that it would recognize its decision.11None the less on the 23rd July a short note was transmitted to the Quai d&apos;Orsay by the British Embassy:   the British Government declared that they could not concur in the despatch of allied reinforce-merits to Upper Silesia as this could only result from a decision of the Allies.   The misunderstanding which appears to have accentuated the divergence of views between the French and English dates from that moment, the British Government having refused to modi fir its point of view and having caused a decision to be framed by the imperial Cabinet on two separate occasions that the despatch of a French division could not be approved by England.The French Government, nevertheless, from that moment onwards has taken into account the English*desire for a rapid decision on the question of Upper Silesia.   They have even accepted the date proposed by the English Government, the 4th of August,, undertaking that the Committee of Experts, wi^ose first labours have demonstrated its utility, should complete its report before the meeting of the Supreme Council.   None the less, they have maintained their point of view which may be recapitulated as follows:-The Allied effectives are manifestly inadequate toensure/
- a -ensure the decision of the Supreme Council which can only be published when the troops in Upper Silesia h&amp;ve been reinforced.  It is thus that it came about that they were compelled to link their acceptance of the date of the 4th August to the acceptance by England of the despatch of reinforce-ments.The British Government having argued that its opposition was based on the fact that, in accordance with the Treaty an Allied agreement wa3 required before reinforcements could be 3ent to Silesia the French Government, admitting their point of view, only raised the question of the safety of their own troops (threatened in tipper Silesia on account of the insufficiency of effectives frequently foreseen by the Inter-allied Committee of Versailles and on account of the strong probability of Polish or German action as soon as the decision of the Powers becomes known, a decision which will doubtless satisfy neither one nor the other of the parties).They could hardly think that a pure and simple veto would be met with from one of the allies.  At the most one might conceive that this ally would draw attention to the inopportunity of despatch and would have expressed disapproval.  It is sufficient to transpose the question and consider it in relation to any other point of cormion occupation to appreciate the answer.   A negative, attitude among allies, or ofone/
tO     9     68one of them can only he explained by a feeling of lack of confidence which has found expression in opinions on the attitude and disposition of the French troops at present on the spot or vftiose despatch is contemplated, as irreconcilable with the facts as with the opinion which soldiers who have spilt their blood together on the battlefields of liberty ougvt to hold of one another. The increase of troops in Upper 311esia should only have met with the cordial approval of the allies, for no privilege was claimed and it was merely a question of further moans to maintain order and to assure the execution of the Treaty of Versailles.    The German Government Itself, when they feared trouble from the Polish side and before they had organised General Hoefforfs troops and anned them so strongly, did not cease to demand reinforcements.    It may also be mentioned that in reply to the recent Frerch Note drawing the attention of Berlin to the maintenance and dissimulation of German self-protection troops in Ufrper Silesia, Doctor Rosen replied by a counter Note claiming that a real danger did exist but fiua the Polish side, which is clearly a further justification for the despatch of reinforcements and not an argument in favour of refusal to assist them.  However that may be, the French Government cannot remain in the position it finds itself in vis h vis Berlin and in this connection awaits from their English allies, who heve very loyally manifested their intention of not allowing this Franco-British discussion to be turned to account at Berlin, a further effort in the same direction.Tie/
The French Government hopes that the conversation between Monsieur Briand and His Excellency L6rd Hardinge will permit of an agreement in that respect and will also facilitate an understanding on the method of despatch of allied reinforcements to Upper Silesia, to which the French Government attach the greatest importance, with a view to avoiding the risks, in their opinion very considerable, of notifying a decision of the Powers without being assured of the means of ensuring its being respected.  They are prepared on their side to take into account, as far as possible, the opinion of the allies with a view to maintaining between them that close union which has constituted their power in the past and which they also believe necessary in the future, if a compromise (conciliation) compatible with their dignity and with their essential interests can be found by a common effort of goodwill in understanding one another^ points of view..   A, BRIAND.
