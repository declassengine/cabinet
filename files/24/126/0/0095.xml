This document is the property oi His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.SECRET.CP. 3193.V    ) 4    *****THE CABINET.MILITARY LEGAL STAFF.memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate a note by the Judge-Advocate-General. I hope that when any of my colleagues have appointments to fill for which barristers or solicitors are suitable, they Gen will bear in mind these officers, who have carried out extremely difficult work for the &apos; 71 Government, often at grave personal risk.L. W.-E.The Wae Office, 3rd August, 1921.I am, as arranged, bringing to your notice, in order that they may not be over-looked,&apos; the claims of the Military Legal Staff who have been responsible for the administration of the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act. They are-all professional men, barristers or solicitors, who have temporarily given up their civil occupation and at very great personal risk and sacrifice have done invaluable service for the State. It is my deliberate judgment that without their help it would not have been possible to work the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act. The cases tried under that Act have been of the most varied, difficult and important character, including a large number of capital charges. As there is now a possibility of the services of these officers being no longer required, I think it would only be fair that they should receive every consideration from the Government both as regards appointments and as regards reasonable opportunities for rehabilitating themselves in civil life by the grant of leave on full pay and some form of special gratuity.Lieut.-Colonel MacGeagh of this Office has already been in communication with the Comptroller of the Appointments Department of the Ministry of Labour in connection with the question of appointments for these officers in the Civil or Colonial Service. A word from you to the Comptroller or to any of the Government Depart-ments would he of great assistance.F. Cassel.
