(THIS DOCUMENT IS TO PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAKHC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEEMSHT) SECRET,cTfT5l08. CABINETHOUSING   POLICY, v&apos;Memorandum by Dr* Addison.I have read with dismay the draft conclusions of the Pinanoe Committee of the Cabinet at their meeting held on Thursday, June 50th. (F.C 35th Conclusions).These conclusions, to quote the Note. &quot;involve the &quot;suspension of the Government&apos;s housing policy,&quot;Earlier in the year with a view to reducing expenditure, I (then the Minister of Health) reached an agreement with the Chancellor of the Exchequer (now the Lord Privy Seal) as to a greatly reduced housing programme.    We agreed upon a more rigid application of the veto on tenders at high prices which had been in operation for some months previously, on a limit of  15,000,000 for the liabilities of the State on housing, apart from the subsidy scheme, and on a total of 300,000 as a limit of the number of houses to be assisted under all schemes combined, including slum reclamation and the houses to be provided under the subsidy scheme. During the limit of time which applies to all the assisted schemes this seemed to be the least that could be done.When this figure of 300,000 is contrasted with the demands of the Local Authorities which totalled 800,000 houses, it will be realised what a drastic reduction it involved,,I feel, however, that it was justified in view of our straitened circumstances and the fact that in many cases the Local Authorities&apos; demands appeared to be inflated, and whilst admittedly it would not suffice to meet the full public needs, it would nevertheless represent a substantial aid during the whole period of the scheme to which we were pledged.
r2**If my colleagues will cast their minds back a year or so, they will recall that, at that time, I was being pressed from all quarters to get on faster, although the more drastic the pressure, the more prices went up.    When the houses began to appear on all the main roads of the land, then an outcry of an opposite kind arose.When I left the Ministry of Health on April 1st. the Prime Minister gave me an assurance that the policy of the Ministry of Health would not be altered. , At that time, contracts had been entered into for 155,000 houses and tenders had been more or less approved for 180,000 houses.After making necessary adjustments and substituting where possible, less expensive tenders, my colleague, the Minister of Health, finds himself at present committed to 176,000 houses,The first conclusion of the Finance Committee in this matter is,:-    thus far and no further at all.The second conclusion of the Finance Committee in respect to the subsidy scheme is to the same effect, although a Bill extending the scheme to June, 1922, has just been passed by Parliament and received the Royal Assent on the day following the meeting of the Finance Committee (Friday 1st July),The third conclusion of the Finance Committee was asfollows:-&quot;(c).   That if some quite moderate expenditure on the amelioration of slums were found possible after consultation between .the Minister of Health and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, it should be favourably cons considered.&quot;Seeing, however, that the proposal of the Minister of Health in this connection was not adopted, the contribution which may be made in this way will clearly be of an un-substantial character.
I think that the following are statements of fact which cannot be gainsaid(1).   That the pledge of a determined effort to assist better housing was given by the Government to the people at the General Election.     It was later adopted by the Government and by Parliament.(2).   That the shortage of houses is very acute and is a potent cause of avoidable physical disabilities and of social discontent.(3).   That the shortage has become more acute owing * to the fact that for some time before the war house-building was much below normal and during the war was stopped.(4).   That in 1911, 2,000,000 people were living in over-crowded conditions and that there are at least 180,000 houses now inhabited which are &quot;unfit for human habitation.&quot;(5).   That enormous State expenditure in cnher directions, as the Supplementary Estimates of the present year alone suffice to show, have greatly restricted our ability to undertake the restorative work to which we are pledged and for the failure of which we would be held responsible,(6).   That, as the Minister of Health said in his Memorandum, the decision recorded bears no relation to the housing needs of the nation and to what is essential to Its health; and that normal building by private enterprise is not in sight.(?).   That the nett effect of these decisions will be that when existing contracts are executed, house-building it I this country will practically be at a dead stop._I earnestly invite my colleagues to desist from reaching so disastrous a conclusion, but rather to assure
a reasonable, joontinuan&amp;e -of housing &quot;by-reduction -of expenditure less essential to the people&apos;s need.C... ADD IS ON.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.V/. 4th July, 1921.
