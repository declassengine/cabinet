......       *     79b Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Govemme&amp;fc]-Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1921. I--------SECRET.CP-3113.CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE STATE OF IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 4th instant.General State of the Country.Statistics of Outrages.Except in the Dublin area, which has been comparatively quiet during the week, the peace discussions have had no perceptible effect in diminishing the number of outrages throughout the country. The campaign of guerilla warfare against the Forces of the Crown has shown no signs of abatement, but on the other hand, there has been no indication that the extremist elements in the rebel councils are forcing the pace with the design of wrecking whatever prospect of a settlement exists. The total number of casualties sustained by the Crown Forces (40) was slightly below the average of recent weeks, Police casualties numbering 14 killed and 20 wounded, and Military casualties 1 killed and 5 wounded.Twenty-five ambushes of Police and Military patrols occurred during the week, and in several instances resulted in severe fighting, in which the rebels had considerably the worse of the encounter. On the 29th ultimo, a motor patrol, consisting of a Sergeant and 8 Constables of the Royal Irish Constabulary, under the command of a Head Constable, was ambushed near Glenties, co. Donegal, 2 Constables being wounded by the first volley of the rebel fire. The remainder of the party at once dismounted and engaged their assailants, who fled after losing at least 4 of their number wounded. Another engagement in which the rebels are known to have suffered heavy losses, took place near Cullens, co. Sligo, on the 1st instant, A cycling patrol, consisting only of 7 men, was ambushed about 11-30 a.m. by two separate parties of rebels stationed about 300 yards apart, and at the first onset lost 1 of their number wounded and 2 taken prisoners. The 4 remaining members of the patrol defended themselves gallantly against overwhelming odds until reinforcements arrived, when one of the rebel ambush parties withdrew, taking with them the 2 captured Constables, who were subsequently found murdered, On the arrival of further Police and Military reinforcements a running fight ensued, in which several of the rebels were killed, the pursuit being kept up until 6 p.m., when it had to be abandoned owing to the difficult nature of the country, which was mainly composed of mountain and bogland. On the 2nd instant, a convoy of 7 motor tenders, 4 occupied by Police under the charge of a District Inspector and 3 by Military, were attacked by a large party of rebels near Monreal, Ennistymon District, co. Clare. The Crown Forces at once replied with heavy rifle&quot; and machine- \ gun fire, and the rebels fled, after offering a feeble&apos; resistance. There were no casualties on the Crown side, but the rebels are believed to have suffered severely.Fourteen unsuccessful attacks on occupied Police Barracks were made during the week, but as usual the majority were merely sniping operations. In one instance, however (Frenchpark Barracks, Castlerea District, co. Roscommon), the attack was kept up for three hours and served as a cover for the destruction of the Courthouse and the old vacated Police Barrack in the same town, which were burned while the Police were engaged in the defence of the new barrack.[6561]
Two other Courthouses (Newcastlewest, co. Limerick, and Banagher, King&apos;s County), and 3 Coastguard Stations (Ballycroneen, co. Cork, Clogher Head and Annagasson, co. Louth, were destroyed during the week, and 2 Coastguard Stations (Dundalk, co, Louth, and Pigeon House Road, Dublin), were partially destroyed.Eight murders of civilians attributable to Sinn Fein were reported, 3 of the victims being ex-Service men, and 2 attempted murders.Arrests for outrages and political offences numbered 96.Trials of Civilians by Court-Martial.Sixty-one trials of civilians by court-martial were concluded during the week, resulting in 51 convictions and 10 acquittals. The following is an analysis of the sentences imposed: 1 sentence of penal servitude for life. 16 sentences of penal servitude (3 years to 20 years). 20 sentences of imprisonment with hard labour (3 months to 2 years).4 sentences of imprisonment without hard labour (1 month to 2 years).7 fines (105. to 25/.).3 sentences remitted.Total   51The life sentence was imposed for the offence of setting fire to a house, and sentences of 20 years&apos; penal servitude and 15 years&apos; penal servitude respectively were imposed for attempted arson of a house and for forcibly entering a dwelling-house with firearms. Sentences ranging from 3 months&apos; imprisonment with hard labour to 5 years&apos; penal servitude were imposed in the cases of 6 Special Constables convicted of looting at Clones, co. Monaghan, on the 23rd January last, and sentences of 2 months&apos; and 12 months&apos; imprisonment without hard labour on 2 Constables of the Royal Irish Constabulary convicted respectively of attempted robbery with firearms and misappropriation of money. Three other Constables tried on charges of theft were acquitted.Internment Orders.The following statement shows the present position as regards internments:  Orders made      ...        ...        ...        ...         ...     3,742Orders cancelled for reasons other than release 126 Releases ordered ...        ...        ...         ...       318444Number of persons now interned    ...        ...        ...     3,298 -The number of appeals awaiting hearing is 38.State of the Police Forces.The week&apos;s recruiting figures for the Regular Royal Irish Constabulary are again highly satisfactory and show a net increase of 118 in the strength of the force. The strength of the Auxiliary Division is slightly reduced below that of last week, but the wastage will no doubt be made good in the course of the next few days. The following are the usual particulars for the week :

Mr. de Valera&apos;s invitation to Sir James Craig to participate in a preliminary All-Ireland Conference in Dublin opened up an entirely new development of the situation, and, undoubtedly, caused disappointment and alarm to many of his own supporters, who realised clearly enough that the terms in which this proposal was couched rendered it impossible of acceptance. The invitation to Lord Midleton and the Southern Unionists stood on a different footing, and the patriotic willingness of these gentlemen to co-operate with their opponents in the effort to find some means of effecting a settlement on broad national lines won universal appreciation. Public confidence in the chances of peace received a further stimulus from the release from prison of Mr. Arthur Griffith and four other prominent Sinn Fein leaders, and whatever doubts,existed in the minds of Southern Irishmen as to the sincerity of the Governments intentions would appear now to have been dispelled. The conference between Mr. de Valera and the Southern Unionists was opened&apos; in the Mansion House, Dublin, yesterday, and has been adjourned until Friday. A guarded announcement issued by the Sinn Fein Publicity Bureau states that certain agree-ments were come to at yesterday&apos;s meeting, and I observe that Lord Midleton is reported, as having said to a Press Association interviewer that he saw no reason to be dissatisfied with the progress made. At the time of writing, the decision of the Sinn Fein leaders on the question of attending a London conference is still in doubt, but the prevailing feeling is one of optimism, and I find it difficult to believe that they will take the desperate course of committing themselves and their country to a policy of uncompromising republicanism.H.
