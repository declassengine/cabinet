(This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government JPrinted for the Cabinet.I UNDERSTAND that proposals may be made for the reduction of the salaries of Cabinet Ministers.It is both a delicate and a distasteful task to comment upon measures which involve my own pecuniary position, and to do so at the present moment is peculiarly invidious by reason of the obvious difficulties of the financial situation.I am of opinion, however, that such serious results would follow from any reduction in the salary of the Lord Chancellor and such grave injury would be caused to the general administration of justice, that I am bound to impress upon my colleagues the case for leaving the present salary unaltered.The Lord Chancellor at present receives a salary of 10,0007. a year, of which 6,000L is attributable to his office as Lord Chancellor and 4,000Z. to his office as Speaker of the House of Lords, and he receives a pension of 5,0001. a year. It is relevant to compare this both with the amount which Lord Chancellors have received in the past and with the salaries of other Judges.Before 1833, the Lord Chancellor was remunerated largely out of fees. Statutes passed in the 18th and the early part of the 19th century had from time to time endeavoured to regulate his position and had charged upon his fee income certain payments for the salaries of the Vice-Chancellor. In 1832, the whole of the fees were surrendered, his other sources of income were cut off, and his salary was fixed at lO,000L a year (2 &amp; 3 Wm. IV, cap. 122, 1832). The Act does not mention the Lord Chancellors salary as Speaker of the House of Lords, but in fact he received a further 4,000Z. on that account, making his total yearly emoluments 14,0001 In the same year, by 2 &amp; 3 Wm. IV, cap. Ill, a number of offices, a list of which is set out in the Statute, were abolished. The Act proceeds: &quot; And whereas by reason of the abolition of the said offices, the Lord High Chancellor .... will be deprived of the patronage and gift of the said offices which does by right belong to and have been exercised by him, and it is therefore just and equitable that all ample provision should be made for the Lord Chancellor .... on his retirement from office,&quot; and makes provision for the grant to the Lord Chancellor upon retirement of an annuity of 5,000i. The connection between the abolition of the offices and the institution of the pension was that in the past it had been the practice for Lord Chancellors to grant these valuable offices to their sons, and thereby make provision for their families.In the year 1851, the Act 14 &amp; 15 Vic, cap. 83, sec. 17, amended the Act of William IV and required that the salary should be a net yearly sum of 10,0001., the salary paid in respect of the Speakership being set off against an equal amount of the salary paid in respect of the Lord Chancellorship.In the following year, 15 &amp; 16 Vic, cap. 87, sec. 16, charged the Lord Chancellors salary, which hitherto had been payable out of the monies in the hands of the Accountant-General of the Court of Chancery, upon the Consolidated Fund.It. is very difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain what was the value of the office before the Act of 1832. It can, however, be inferred from the fortunes left by various holders of the office that the profits were at times very large indeed. Thus Lord Hardwicke accumulated during his tenure of office what was in those days looked upon as a great fortune. Lord Eldon was enabled to purchase very large landed estates and make ample provision for his family. He is said to have left 500,0001. The office, looked at from a financial point of view alone, apart from the great dignity and prestige which it carried, at a time when the holder was a member of a very small Cabinet and exercised patronage of enormous extent and great political influence, was a goal sufficient to tempt the most ambitious and the ablest members of the profession.It is easier to compare with the position of present and future Chancellors that held by those who have kept the Great Seal since the passing of the Act of 1832.   By[6642J
the statutes constituting the salary it was declared to be free of tax and all other deduction. Grave doubts may arise as to the effect of this provision upon the salary at the present day as regards income tax and super tax. Until recently income tax stood at such a figure that it was unlikely that any Lord Chancellor would claim exemption, and since it has risen, whatever the legal rights -of the matter may be, obvious considerations make it impossible for him to put forward any such claim. In the result, the Lord Chancellor receiving a salary of 10,000Z. a year finds himself, if he is a bachelor without private means, liable to an income tax of 2,866L and a super tax of 1,4621., leaving a net income of 5,672/. When regard is had to the alteration in the value of money since 1853, we reach the result that the present holder of the office receives little, if at all, more in value than a quarter of that which accrued to his predecessor seventy years ago.There is a further small change for the worse in the Lord Chancellors financial position, in that until recently it was the practice to pay to.him 1,8431.13*. as an outfit allowance upon his appointment. During Lord Haldane&apos;s tenure of office this payment was abandoned, the Treasury undertaking the burden of discharging the bill for the robes which are necessary in the discharge of his official and judicial functions-a far smaller sum.At the same time, the expenses of the office have rather increased than decreased. Immemorial custom lays upon the Lord Chancellor the duty of attending in state upon numerous ceremonial occasions, all of which involve him in some cost in addition to that which falls upon an ordinary Minister. It is apprehended that the public,- however zealous for economy, would view the disappearance of this picturesque pageantry with regret. Once in every year the Lord Chancellor has to discharge the cost of the service in the Abbey upon the opening of the Law Courts, and on the same occasion, following the example of his predecessors, has to entertain the Bench and Bar to what is nominally breakfast, but in fact is an expensive lunch. It is difficult for the Lord Chancellor, out of his official income, to discharge these necessary payments, and any reduction of the salary must result in their disappearance. In addition to these time-honoured ceremonies, he has to bear the ordinary cost of entertaining which falls upon nis colleagues as well as himself,&apos; and as the Chief Judge and as head of the legal profession he has of necessity to entertain largely classes of persons, including British, American and Colonial Judges, in respect of whom no similar obligation arises on the part of other Ministers of the Crown. If, therefore, the Lord Chancellor is in receipt of a nominal salary in excess of that enjoyed by his ministerial colleagues, he has to meet expenses to which they are not liable.I have hitherto considered the position of the Lord Chancellor as a Minister, but it remains to bring to notice the relation in which he stands towards his brethren upon the Bench, a relation which from the point of view of the present memorandum is of even greater importance, so far as financial considerations are involved.It is admitted as a principle that the Judges generally are underpaid in the circumstances of the present day, and that, whether it may or may not be opportune at the present moment to increase their salaries, a case has been made out for doing so which would be irresistible were it not for temporary financial exigencies. My colleagues are in possession of a memorandum upon this subject which was circulated to the Cabinet jointly from this Department and the Treasury. It is unnecessary for me to recapitulate the arguments therein adduced. I will only repeat that we are in the presence of a situation in which the emoluments of all those paid by salary have suffered a material diminution in value, while the class from which the person to he appointed to these offices is drawn is in receipt of very greatly increased fees and a very much larger income than a few years ago.If this latter fact is true in respect of the leaders at the Bar, from among whom puisne Judges are as a rule appointed, it is still more true of those few persons from among whom the Lord Chancellor must be selected.If it be conceded that the Lord Chancellorship should be the prize to be sought by the most pre-eminent of those leaders of the Bar who have had experience in political life, the difficulty of ensuring this result except upon the offer of substantial financial reward and great prestige is at once apparent.A barrister who has attained the very high political&apos; and professional position which comes only to one or two in each decade has before him two great prizes in addition to the Law Officerships, namely, the office of Lord Chancellor and the office of Lord Chief Justice. It has hitherto been the practice that these offices were in practice confined to those who had held the Attorney-Generalship or at least the Solicitor-Generalship.    Any Attorney-General or Solicitor-General having it in his
power to make a choice between these two offices must necessarily consider that the office of Lord Chief Justice is permanent while that of the Lord Chancellor is temporary, that the former office is by far less arduous than the latter, -and that upon the expiration of his term of office as Lord Chancellor, which may happen at any-time, he cannot in practice return to the Bar and is henceforth condemned to a life upon a pension of 5,0001. a year, less tax, with duties which are as responsible and almost as onerous as those ot the Lord Chief Justice.He will, in the first &apos;place, ask himself whether upon abandoning his Law Officership he should not prefer to resume practice at the Bar, to which he would return with his prestige and value increased by his tenure of office. But if he has reached the time of life at which security and some relaxation from excessive labour become tempting, it is hardly possible that lie should choose the Chancellorship in preference to the Lord Chief Justiceship if any change is now made for the worse in the remuneration of the former office.The advantages offered by the Lord Chancellorship disappear if it has a pecuniary value not more than equal to the Lord Chief Justiceship, and if, as an inevitable consequence, the latter comes to be looked upon as the more desirable prize, the prestige of the office itself will decline and the Lord Chief Justice rather than the Lord Chancellor will be looked upon as the chief judicial officer of the country. It may be said that it is a matter of no moment to the country whether aspiring lawyers seek the one office in preference to the other.   Such an idea is fallacious.In the first place, it is of vital importance to the Government of the day that they should have with them in the daily communications of the Cabinet and the conduct of official business a colleague who is pre-eminently the head of the judicial system, and is equipped with the very highest legal attainments.In the second place, tbe whole tendency of modern legislation and modern thought upon these matters has been to collect together the administrative and executive functions of the chief judicial officer in one set of hands, and those the hands of one who is in daily touch with the business of government and is responsible to Parliament. The risk of a conflict between the executive and the judiciary is never absent from any democratic country. There have been occasions in repent years, which will be fresh in the memory of my colleagues, when it has appeared that that risk would take effect in action. Such an event would be calamitous. It would shake the confidence of the country both in the executive government and in the administration of justice. The fact that it has been avoided in dangerous times is due almost, wholly to the arrangement of our judicial and administrative systems, under which by an anomaly, difficult to defend in argument but highly salutary in practice, the chief judicial officer has been also a prominent member of the executive government. He furnishes in himself a link between the two systems. Without interfering with the independence of each judicial officer, he is yet able to provide from his knowledge of administration a corrective influence upon the college of justice. On the other hand, m the Government itself he stands as the representative of pure law amongst colleagues whose primary, concern is the efficient despatch of business. Lastly, he brings as the President of the Supreme Appellate Court, both of the United Kingdom and of the British dominions, an experience of administration to the ultimate consideration of judicial matters.If such steps are taken now as to depress his position, and as a result to exalt that of the Lord Chief Justice, the division between the executive and the judiciary will be widened, and each institution proceeding on its independent course will suffer from the separation.For these reasons I would most earnestly press upon my colleagues that, whatever course may be taken with respect to the salaries of the Judges or of other Ministers of the Crown, the reduction in the salary of the Lord Chancellor would have constitutional results so far-reaching and so unfortunate as greatly to outweigh any small financial economy.I have only to add that, had I ceased to be Lord Chancellor, this memorandum would have been much more strongly worded.Counsel earning in rare cases 40,O00L or 30,000i. a year and not uncommonly 20,000Z. appear before me in the House of Lords.It was the calculated object of our ancestors in-dealing with my office to prevent this discrepancy upon evident grounds of public policy. To aggravate it would, in my opinion, lead to disaster.B.July 22, 1921.
