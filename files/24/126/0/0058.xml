49M.H.37.TIIIS DOCUKSilT 13 THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITAIN IC MAJSSTYTS GOVERNMENT,CABINET.7 ,M2DIOAL   SjGCR^CY.CT.QRANDUf.1 BY the MINISTER OF HEALTH ,I wish to bring to the attention of my colleaguesa question which has recently assumed great importance in connectionwith the campaign against venereal disease, though it also demandsserious consideration from a more general point of view.    I refer to the position of medical men as witnesses in courts of law, who,as the law now stands, are denied the privilege which I understandis enjoyed by lawyers in similar corcumstances, and who aretherefore compelled under threat of imprisonment to violate theconfidence of their patients and break the almost sacred rule oftheir own profession.It is no exaggeration to say that the success of the cam-paign against venereal disease depends upon the pledge of secrecyunder which treatment at the clinics (mainly financed by theExchequer) is carried on.    The Ministryra Regulations are verystringent on this pointy but cannot of course alter the general law of evidence;   and in several cases during the last eighteen months -doctors attached to clinics have been subpoenaed, most commonly indivorce proceedings, to five evidence against their own patients whohave been under treatment by them at a clinic    These cases, beingwidely reported, are having a most prejudicial effect not only inundermining the confidence of those attending the clinics, but alsoupon the doctors themselves.    A case Ocurred a few weeks ago in whicha doctor of the highest standing, a Fellow of both the Royal Colleges,was compelled to give evidence against a patient whom he had attendedat a most important clinic where he is the principal Medical Officer,and I am informed that both he and his colleagues, feeling their position/
position seriously shaken, are considering tho question cf resignation.    I have similar reports from all over the country.But apart from this particular aspect of tho matter, I would invite my colleagues to consider whether, on broad grounds of public policy, the time has not now come when the privilege of the medical adviser should be recognised equally with that of the lawyer.    The priest, whose position is analftgous, enjoys, I am told, a privilege, in fact, if not in law, and I confess that to my mind the claims of the doctor are not less meritorious in this respect than those of either lawyer or priest.    I am being pressed by the   medical profession to take the matter up, and, so far as 1 am able to ascertain, public opinion is with them.    The movement has my own entire sympathy.I wish to make it quite clear that my proposal does not extend to evidence ir. criminal cases, in which I have no doubt that it would not be right for any privilege to be given. I confine myself exclusively to the case of civil proceedings, and I annex to this memorandum an extract from the Hew Zealand Evidence Act of 1908, and I suggest that a short Bill upon the same lines would give the medical profession all that they can reasonably ask, though I would prefer that the enacting words should run - &quot;A physician or surgeon shall not, without the &quot;consent of his patient, he compeliable to divulge in any civil &quot;proceeding, etc.&quot;    Legislation on these lines has been passed not only in Now Zealand but also in Victoria and Tasmania;     in Hew York, Missouri, Michigan, Wisconsin, California and twelve other States of the United States.    The medical witness is also privileged In Prance and, I believe, in most other European countries.    These are respectable precedents.I have been in communication with the Lord Chancellor on the subject, but I have not been so fortunate as to secure his concurrence in my proposals.    He points out that theHew/
New Zealand, Statute Is directed only to evidence given in a court of law upon oath, and. that it is anomalous that a doctor should be forbidden to give evidence whioh will assist in the administration of justice, while apparently he is still free to divulge anything he likes so long as elvil proceeding is not in existence j and he quotes a report of the proceedings of the British Medical Association in 1920 as showing that in certain circumstances a doctor might feel it absolutely necessary as citizen or friend to make disclosure   of matters which had come to his knowledge in his professional capacity. I venture to think, however, that this objection is entirely met by the amendment in the wording 01* the New Zealand Statute which I have suggested above, by which a doctor would not be forbidden to give the evidence in question, but would only be not compeliable to give it.My colleagues have doubtless seen reoent references to this subject in the public press, and these have been almost wholly favourable to tho doctors&apos; point of view.   1 might add that there is a strong body of legal opinion on the some side and I may refer to a sympathetic article in the &quot;law Journal&quot; of 18th June last.Lord Lawson of Penn proposes on July 27th to draw attention to the subject in the House of Lords and to move for the appointment of a Select Committee.   I understand that the Lord Chancellor intends to take part in the debate and, as he informs me, to express himself strongly on the subject of medical privilege in criminal cases.   But in view of the difference of   opinion which unfortunately eacistt between ua with regard to the privilege in civil cases, It becomes necessary to invite an expression of opinion from our colleagues as/
as a whole.     If tho Cabinet do not for the moment feel in a position to express a definite opinion on one side or the other, I would very strongly urge that Lord &quot;Dawson*s motion for the appointment of a Select Committee be accepted, in order that the matter may be thoroughly gone into, and witness^ heard whose views, whether for or against the proposal, would carry weight,A, IOTD.
