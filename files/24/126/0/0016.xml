IRISH RAILWAYS (SETTLEMENT OF CLARIS) BILL.. 1 1 mm in iw n.......11       ..........&quot; &apos;.....*i       &quot; -..........in        .    a,&apos;......ii.....ijn5.P.3116.Memorandum by the Minister of Transport,I have effected a settlement with the principal Irish Railway Companies on the question of their claims against the State arising out of the possession which the state has had of their Railways, for purposes of the War.-The Irish Railway Companies have agreed to accept the sum of three million pounds, free of income tax, and to concur in giving to the State the same complete discharge from liability as that which has been settled, in conference with the Law Officers of the Crown, for the purpose of the corresponding arrangement made with the English Railway Companies.I have prepared and present for the consideration of my Colleagues, a Bill to give effect to the arrangement which I have made with the Irish Railway Companies.     It provides (Clause 1) for the composition at the above mentioned sum of the claims of the Companies under the Railway Agreements, the Regulation of the Forces Act, 1871, the Ministry of Transport Act, 1919, or otherwise arising out of the possessionby the Crown.   The Bill makes the same reservations with-respect to the settlement of the claims arising during control as has been made in the case of the English Companies.     It leaves open all adjustments of the payments which have yet to be-made as part of the guarantee of net receipts upon which the ^    agreements are founded. *The Bill also provides (Clause 2) for the distribution among the Irish Railway Companies, of the sum of three million pounds which will be payable under the Bill.
A sum of two hundred...thousand pounds is specifically ^allocated. as -a&apos;&apos;payment in advance to assist those Companies who, after control ceases, are likely to work at a loss during the remainder of this year.The balance of two million e ight. hundred thousand pounds is left for distribution as may be agreed or failing agreement as may be settled by the Tribunal named in the Bill.The gentlemen named have been agreed upon by the Companies with almost complete unanimity, and, although they may not be those whom after consultation with the Chief Secretary I should have suggested for appointment, I feel that it is inexpedient to interfere with a Tribunal selected with so great a degree of unanimity by the Railway Companies tbe*ns^m6*oClause 2 (4) provides that no sum received by a Railway Company under the Bill shall be charged to income tax,I have found it necessary to suggest that Railways which are worked by a Company other than the owners of the line should be specially dealt with in those cases in which the working agreement provides for payment by the working Company to the owning Company of a percentage of the gross receipts from the line.This class of Railway was specially dealt with under the Agreement with the Irish Railways, and statutory effect was given by the Irish Railways (Confirmation of Agreement) Act, 1919, to the provision of that agreement relating to this class.Under those provisions the owners of the line receive the same psyment per annum during the continuance of the Government possession as they received in the year 1913.I propose (Clause 3) to provide that this position 1 should be continued until the Council ,of Ireland- c4b&amp;rrl&amp;&amp;provide.
If this provision be not made, the owners of the lines in question will receive payment of the agreed percentage of gross receipts which have been very largely increased, not by any Increase in traffic, but solely by an increase in charges designed to meet the increase in the working expenses incurred by the working Company.(Signed) ERIC GEDDES.Ministry of Transport, 8th July, 1921,
