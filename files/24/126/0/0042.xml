That officer, in accordance with the recommendations of the Asquith Committee, has received  3,000 a year from the 1st March 1920 hut his statutory salary remains unaltered at  2,000 and it is urgently necessary to regularise the consequent unconstitutional position.The proposals in the Report and the Draft Bill have &quot;been fully discussed with the Public Accounts , Committee who have expressed general approval of them though individual members may wish to raiae minor points.The Public Accounts Committee have devoted! several meetings specially to the Report, and undoubtedly expect the Bill to be introduced at once.

COMMITTEE ON THE EXCHEQUER AND AUDIT DEPARTMENTS ACT, 1866 (29 &amp; 30 Viet. c. 39).To the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury. My Lords,1. Under the terms ol* our reference we were appointed to &quot; consider the &quot; provisions of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1866, and to report on &quot; any amendment needed therein.&quot; We have the honour to submit the following report accordingly.2. Except for the amendment relating to the shipbuilding and manufacturing and like accounts of the Army and Navy dealt with by the Army and Navy Audit Act, 1889, no substantial amendment has been made to the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act since it was passed over 50 years ago.3. The main structure of the Act of 1866 remains, and we should be the last to suggest or support any attempt to alter its main lines. With the lapse of 50 years, however, on the one hand experience has shown that some of the provisions of the Act of 1866 are unduly restrictive in present circumstances, and on the other hand new classes of accounts not required in 1866 have now become necessary.4. In the first place, at the time when the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act was passed the system of appropriation audit was new. Such audit was first established for Naval Services in 1832, extended to Military Services in 1847, to the Accounts of the Commissioners of Woods and Works in 1851, and finally by the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act of 1866 to the whole of the supply grants comprised in the Appropriation Act of each year, thus introducing a system of audit common to the whole of the public service.5. In the second place there has been a great expansion in the keeping of accounts in a commercial form. There is at present do provision under the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act by which the Comptroller and Auditor General is required to audit and to report to Parliament upon such commercial accounts.6. The circumstances in which the Act of 1866 was framed explain, we think, to some extent, the very inelastic provisions contained in the Act as to the nature of the audit to be applied to Appropriation Accounts by the Comptroller and Auditor General. By that Act he was required in his examination to have regard to the following points: 1. Appropriation.2. Arithmetical accuracy.3. Credit of receipts.4. Proof of payment.5. Authority governing payment.7. In particular, with the exception of certain accounts included in or to be added to Schedule B (in which case a test examination sufficed), no deviation from a full hundred per cent, audit of the accounts was contemplated by the Act.8. The consequence has been that practice has in certain respects tended to diverge, especially during the war period, from the provisions of the Act, which con-templated detailed audit to an extent both impracticable and uneconomical. With the experience acquired by over fifty years working of the Act and the establishment of a sound system of accounting in departmental finance branches, we think that the time has come to give more elasticity to the nature and scope of the audit of the Comptroller and Auditor General, leaving it to his discretion to decide how far a detailed audit should be applied in the case of a particular account, and how far it may be practicable or advisable to accept the Departmental examination as being a . sufficient safeguard, subject always to such further scrutiny as the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Treasury may think fit to impose. We consider that such a change in the system would leave the Comptroller and Auditor General more free to concentrate upon the major questions arising in the course of his duties, without, we are confident, leading to any deterioration in the standard of public accounting.9. It may be asserted that the power to effect such a change is already conferred upon the Treasury through the operation of the provisions of Schedule B of the Act of 1866, which have, up to the present, been applied only to the accounts of theA (38)15151    Wt8536- G 43  1000  7/21   E&amp;S A 2
Army, Navy, Revenue Departments, and Old Age Pensions. But the Act contem-plated a departure from the detailed audit as being an exceptional course, and we think that it would be undesirable in every way that the powers conferred upon the Treasury should be exercised with the object of giving to the Comptroller and Auditor General the right to adopt, should, he so desire, a universal test audit. While we strongly advocate the reasonableness of granting to him a discretion to dispense with a completely detailed audit, we consider that the change should be directly authorised by Parliament. This being our object, we proceed to set out seriatim the amendments which we think are required in the Act of 1866, including therein certain minor amendments.Audit or Appropriation Accounts.10. We recommend in the first place that the provisions of Sections 27, 29, and 30 and Schedule B of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1866, relating to the manner in which the audit of Appropriation Accounts shall be conducted should be amended so as to provide that the Comptroller and Auditor General shall satisfy himself (1) that the money expended has been applied to the purposes for which the grants of Parliament were intended to provide;(2) that the expenditure has been duly authorised;(3) that the accounts bear evidence that the vouchers have been examined and certified as correct by the accounting department.11. We recommend the retention of the provisions in the present Act requiring the Comptroller and Auditor General to apply, if so desired by the Treasury, a more detailed audit both as to the examination of vouchers and the due observance of Treasury authority.12. A suggested draft of the new Section 27 repealing Sections 29 and 30 and Schedule B of the present Act is annexed as an appendix to our Report (Appendix A).13. We suggest that, if our recommendation be adopted, the Comptroller and Auditor General should, where necessary, inform the Committee of Public Accounts of any changes in the extent or character of the examination made by his officers.Audit op Accounts other than Appropriation Accounts.14. Under Section 33 of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1866, the Comptroller and Auditor General is directed to examine and audit, if required so to do by the Treasury and in accordance with any regulations that may be prescribed for his guidance in that behalf by the Treasury, the following accounts, viz.: (a) The accounts of all principal accountants:(fi) The accounts of the receipt of revenue by the Departments of Customs, Inland Revenue and Post Office:(o) The accounts of every receiver of money which is by law payable into H.M. Exchequer:(d) Any other public accounts which, though not relating directly to the receipt or expenditure of imperial funds, the Treasury may by minute, to be laid before Parliament, direct.15. We have given some consideration to the question of how far it is necessary to maintain audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General on behalf of the executive (i e., the Treasury) as well as on behalf of Parliament, and while we have arrived at the conclusion that the powers of Section 33 must be maintained to cover certain classes of accounts in which public money may not be directly involved, we consider that the audit of the accounts of revenue receipts and of the accounts of other moneys payable by law to the Exchequer should be the statutory duty of the Comptroller and Auditor General, and should be conducted by him on behalf of Parliament, to whom his report should be made. We may add that in practice the Repout of the Comptroller and Auditor General upon revenue receipts has been presented to the House of Commons with his Report upon the Appropriation Accounts of the Revenue Departments for some years past, and we think it is clearly right that the House should be in a position to satisfy itself that the accounts of revenue receipts have been duly examined.
16. We recommend, therefore, that steps should be taken to impose a statutory obligation upon the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine accounts of revenue receipts on behalf of Parliament, in order that he may (1) ascertain that adequate regulations and procedure have been framed to secure effective check on the assessment, the collection and the proper allocation of revenue; (2) ascertain by test examination that such regulations are being carried out; (3) make a test examination of the correctness of the sums brought to account.17. It will probably be convenient to effect the change by a new Section and Appendix B to our Report shows a draft clause giving effect to these recom-mendations.18. With regard to the remainder of the accounts comprised in the present Section 33 we think that audit should continue, as at present, on behalf of the Treasury and subject to any directions given by that Department.19. We recommend, however, that Section 36 of the Act of 1866, which details the procedure for examining and passing the accounts audited under Section 33 and which is held to impose upon the Comptroller and Auditor General an obligation to make a complete and detailed audit, and Section 38 which provides for a certificate of discharge to be given to -the accountant, should be repealed, and that a discre-tionary power as to the extent of audit, subject to Treasury directions, should be given to the Comptroller and Auditor General in the same way as we have recom-mended in the case of Appropriation Accounts.20. We recommend also that the certificate of the Comptroller and Auditor General should be appended to such accounts, the ancient procedure of signing and passing them being discontinued.21. We append to our Report a draft clause covering these recommendations (Appendix C).Audit op Store, &amp;c, Accounts.22. Section 40 of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1866, empowers the Treasury to require the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine and audit the accounts of the receipt, expenditure, sale, transfer or delivery of any securities, stamps, Government stock or annuities, provisions or stores the property of His Majesty, and to report to the Treasury thereon.23. While we think that the duty of deciding whether transactions of this nature are of sufficient amount or of such a character as to necessitate the keeping of special accounts should rest with the Treasury, we consider that, wherever such accounts are kept, it should be the statutory duty of the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine them and to report to Parliament thereon. The certificate of discharge to the accountant provided for in the present section is not in practice given and we see no necessity for it.24. We recommend therefore that Section 40 of the present Act should be amended in this sense, and we append a revised draft clause to our Report (Appendix D).Audit of Trading, Manufacturing, &amp;c, Accounts.25. The Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1866, does not provide for the maintenance or audit of trading accounts, though the Army and Navy Audit Act, 1889, required accounts of shipbuilding, manufacturing and other like services of the Army and Navy to - be prepared in such form and by such departments as the Treasury might from time to time direct or approve, and to be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General on behalf of the House of Commons.26. Trading and analogous operations have been undertaken by Government Departments to an extent which could not be foreseen by the framers of the Act of 1866, partly on account of special services undertaken during the war and partly in pursuance of the normal functions of Departments. The policy of the Treasury, which the Public Accounts Committee has frequently endorsed, has been to require Departments to set up accounts in a commercial form in respect of all such operations, and a volume of trading accounts showing the results for 1918-19 of all War Services was presented to Parliament last year.   A further volume has just been issuedA3
comprising accounts up to 31st March 1920, in respect not only of War Services but of normal trading services of Departments carried out as a part of voted services, and the Comptroller and Auditor General has reported upon the accounts.27. At the present time, however, there is no statutory authority for the preparation or audit of these accounts.28. We recommend therefore that power should he taken to provide that  (1) Accounts showing the income and expenditure of trading or commercial services conducted by Departments shall be prepared in such form and by such Departments as the Treasury may from time to time approve or direct, with such particulars of costs as may be necessary. (2) The accounts shall be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General who shall certify and report upon them to the House of Commons.29. We append a draft section to our Report (Appendix E), in which we have incorporated, so far as is necessary, the principles of the Army and Navy Audit Act, 1889.Minor Amendments.30. The above recommendations, if carried into effect, will necessitate certain consequential amendments.31. We recommend, therefore, that the following amendments, consisting chiefly either of the repeal of sections which have become obsolete or of additions required to cover new services which have arisen since the passing of the Act of 1866, should be made: (a) Section 7. We recommend that this section be amended to read &quot; Anything which under the authority of this Act is directed to be done by the Comptroller and Auditor General may, in his absence, be delegated by him to the Assistant Comptroller and Auditor, except the certifying and reporting on accounts for the House of Commons.&quot;(b) Section 8 of the Act of 1866 provides for the appointment of the staff of the Audit Office by the Treasury, and for the regulation of the number and salaries of such staff by Order in Council. &apos;We recommend that the section be repealed, and that a new section in common form should provide for the appointment by the Comptroller and Auditor General of such staff as the Treasury may approve. We append to our Report a draft clause in this sense (Appendix E).(c) Section 9 deals with the conduct of the internal business of the Audit Office and gives the Comptroller and Auditor General power to prescribe certain forms, subject to Treasury approval, a provision not, in fact, exercised.We recommend that the clause be repealed.(d) Section 15 provides that issues from the Exchequer for Army and Navy services shall be made under the general heads of &quot; Army &quot; and &quot; Navy &quot; respectively.In view of the creation of the Air Eorce it is necessary to&apos; make a formal amendment in this section to provide that issues for Air Eorce services should he be made under the head of &quot; Air Eorce.&quot;(e) Section 23 provides that Departments shall keep such books of accounts as may be prescribed by the Treasury, but in its present form it is applicable to cash books only.We recommend that the application of the Section should be extended to cover all books of account by the repeal of the words from and inclusive of &quot; in order to exhibit&quot; down to &quot; each Vote &quot;; and that the procedure by Order in Council should be abolished by the repeal of the words &quot; and Her Majesty may from time to time by Order in Council prescribe &quot; and the substitution in their place of the words &quot; who (i.e. Treasury) shall prescribe.&quot;(/) Section 28, which gives the Comptroller and Auditor General a right of access to the books of account in accounting departments, is similarly limited by the word &quot; cash &quot; in the second and seventh lines. We recommend that the word &quot; cash &quot; be deleted, and that the word &quot; such &quot; in the first line be altered to &quot; his.&quot;(g) Section 32.-In vieAv of the alterations which we have recommended earlier in our Report as to the scope and nature of the Comptroller and Auditor General&apos;s audit of Appropriation Accounts, we think that the detailed directions of Section 32 are unnecessary and tend to be restrictive.
We recommend therefore that the whole of the section be repealed with the exception of the last paragraph, providing for the presentation by the Comptroller and Auditor General to the House of Commons of his Reports if the Treasury shall not have presented them within the prescribed time.As a consequential amendment the words &quot; as hereinafter directed &quot; should be deleted in the seventh line of Section 22.(h) Section 34. As the result of the provisions which we have incorporated in the new clause dealing with the audit of Revenue receipts (Appendix B) the portion of this Section concerning the rendering of accounts by public officers dealing with public moneys either in the nature of revenue or fees of office will become unnecessary.We recommend therefore that the words from and inclusive of &quot;and every public officer&quot; down to &quot; public service&quot; be repealed, and that the words &quot; every accountant&quot; should be inserted in their place. In addition, the words in Section 35 providing for the transmission of authorities and vouchers by Accountants to the Comptroller and Auditor General should be added to this section following the words &quot; Comptroller and Auditor General&quot; in the penultimate line. We append to our Report an Appendix showing the form of Section 31 as revised by these recommendations (Appendix G).(*) Section 35 provides that Accountants shall submit their accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General in accordance with regulations made by him with the approval of the Treasury.   The provision has never been exercised.We recommend that the section be repealed.(j) Schedule A states the dates on or before which Appropriation Accounts are to be submitted by Departments to the Comptroller and Auditor General, by him to the Treasury, and by the Treasury to the House of Commons.A formal amendment of the Schedule is necessary to prescribe dates for the submission of the accounts of the Air Force.&quot; We recommend that the dates for Navy and Air Force should be the same as at present for Army.Amendment or Section 4 of the Act of 1866 dealing with the Salary of the Comptroller and Auditor General.32. We have been informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided in accordance with the recommendations of a Committee presided over by the Rt. Hon. H. H. Asquith (Command Paper 1188) to increase the salary of the Comptroller and Auditor General to three thousand pounds per annum.33. We append to our Report a draft clause carrying out this alteration (Appendix H).Form of the Comptroller and Auditor Generates Certificate.34. While we do not think it is desirable to lay down by statute the form in which the certificate of the Comptroller and Auditor General shall be given, we have con-sidered this question carefully both in view of the large number of different forms at present employed, and also having in mind the difficulty of giving a certificate of correctness without any qualification, in cases when a test audit only has been applied.35. The present form of certificate given upon Appropriation Accounts is: &quot;I certify that this account has been examined under my directions and is correct,&quot; with the addition, where necessary, of the proviso &quot; subject to the observations in the annexed report.&quot;36. Modified forms of certificate are in use for accounts falling within Schedule B of the Act, accounts signed and passed under Section 36, Post Office commercial accounts, and various others chiefly examined in accordance with the directions of special Acts.37. After careful consideration, we recommend the form of certificate given below as suitable for adoption, if the main recommendations of our report are accepted, in the case of all accounts other than the exceptions noted below, which are governed by special Acts or special arrangements.
&quot; I have examined the above account in accordance with the provisions of the &quot; Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1921. I have obtained all the informa-&quot; tion and explanations that I have required and I certify, as the result of my audit, &quot; that in my opinion the above account is correct,&quot; with the addition, when necessary, of &quot; subject to the observations contained in my lleport.&quot;38. The existing forms of certificate should, in our opinion, be retained in the case of the Public Income and Expenditure Account, the Consolidated Eund Account, the Treasury Chest Eund Account, and the Civil Contingencies Eund Account.39. We wish to bring to lour Lordships&apos; notice the great assistance rendered to us by our Secretary, Mr. Ismay, in circumstances of great pressure.We have the honour to be, My Lords, Your obedient Servants,E. D. Acland (Chairman). H. J. Gibson.*0. E. NlEMEYER.Malcolm G. Ramsay.G. Ismay, (Secretary), 23rd June 1921.* I fully concur in the recommendation in paragraph 31 (a) limiting the duties and powers of the Assistant Comptroller and Auditor on the assumption that the post is retained. I wish, however, to point out that I have recommended to the Treasury, in response to their circular of the 13th ultimo to all Departments calling for a Reduction of Public Expenditure, the abolition of the post of Assistant Comptroller aud Auditor and its replacement by that of Secretary, thereby effecting economy and securing the full and undivided responsibility of the Comptroller and Auditor General.H. J. Gibson, 23rd June 1921.APPENDIX A.Draft Clause amalgamating Sections 27 and 29 of the Exchequer and AuditDepartments Act, 1866.Every Appropriation Account shall be examined by the Comptroller aud Auditor General on behalf of the House of Commons, and in the examination of such accounts the Comptroller and Auditor General shall satisfy himself that the money expended has been applied to the purpose or purposes for which the Grants of Parliament were intended to provide, and that the expenditure conforms to the authority which governs it.   The Comptroller and Auditor General in any case after satisfying himself that the vouchers have been examined and certified as correct by the Accounting Department may at his discretion, and having regard to the character of such departmental Examination, admit the sums so certified without further evidence of payment in support of the charges to which they may relate, provided always that if the Treasury should desire any such vouchers to be examined in greater detail the Comptroller and Auditor General shall act accordingly, and it is hereby enacted, that whenever the Comptroller and Auditor General shall be required by the Treasury to ascertain whether any expenditure included in an Appropriation Account is supported by the Authority of the Treasury, the Comptroller and Auditor General shall examine such expenditure with that object, and shall report to the Treasury any expenditure which may appear, upon such examination, to have been incurred without such authority ; and if the Treasury should not thereupon see fit to sanction such unauthorised expenditure, it shall be regarded as being not properly chargeable to a Parliamentary grant, and shall be so reported to the House of Commons.&quot; Delete Section 29, Section 30 and Schedule.

CORRESPONDENCE between the TREASURY and the COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS upon the foregoing REPORT.Treasury Chambers,Whitehall, S.W.I.F. 1997. 29th June 1921.Sir,The Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury desire me to enclose, for the information of the Committee of Public Accounts, copy of a Report which They have received from the Treasury Committee appointed to consider the provisions of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1866.My Lords are disposed to accept the recommendations of the Committee, and propose to introduce into Parliament forthwith the necessary legislation to carry them out. They are anxious, however, that the House of Commons should know that the changes proposed by the Committee meet with the approval of the Committee of Public Accounts, if, as They hope, that is the case, and in any case They would greatly value any criticisms or suggestions which that Committee may desire to make.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Signed)     Hilton Young.The Chairman,Public Accounts Committee.House of Commons,7th July, 1921.Sir,I have to thank you for your letter of 29th June, enclosing, for the information of the Committee on Public Accounts, copy of a Report on the provisions of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1866, and expressing the desire of the Lords of the Treasury to receive any criticisms and suggestions which that Committee might desire to make.The Committee at once considered the matter at its meeting on 30th June, and at subsequent meetings.With regard to paragraph 31, page 6, of the Report and the recommendation therein as to the powers of the Assistant Comptroller and Auditor, we learn that this recommendation is now out of date, inasmuch as the Government has decided to propose the abolition of the office. This being the case, it is perhaps rather late for us to say anything about it as a Committee, though we may, of course, iu due time express our individual views as Members of the House of Commons.I have, however, to say that if the proposed abolition is judged to be in the interest of economy, we do not as a Committee object, provided that the proposed Secretary should always be a person thoroughly competent to act in the place of the Comptroller and Auditor General in the event of the latter&apos;s illness or absence. In such cases he would have to undertake towards other Departments duties requiring much independence and strength ; and to render services of no easy nature to our Committee.As Mr. Wilkius has been an official of our Committee, and in his short time of office has done it good service, we feel we are entitled to expect with confidence that he will not be prejudiced by a change which has not been caused by any defect on his part.The proposed abolition is certainly not without some risks, but with the proviso above stated, we do not, as a Committee, object to it.With regard to the other proposed changes, we consider that the proposal in paragraph 13, p. 4, should be amended so that the Comptroller and Auditor General should have a statutory duty to report to the House of Commons all important changes in the extent and character of the examination made by his officers.   The words &quot; where necessary &quot; are, we hold, difficult of interpretation and not without danger.There are other points in the Report on which the Members of the Committee desire to reserve their right to express their opinion in the House of Commons.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Signed)     Aneurin Williams, The Financial Secretary, Chairman, Public Accounts Committee.Treasury, S.W.1.Printed under the authority of His Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office By Eyre and Spottiswoode, Ltd., East Harding Street, E.C. 4, Printers to the King&apos;s most Excellent Majesty.
