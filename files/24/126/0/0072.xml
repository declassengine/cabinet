[This Documeiitjs the Property of HisJ^tonic^ajesty&apos;secret^overnnient.]Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1921.SECRET. $CP.-3170.CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE STATE OF IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 25th instant.General State of the Country.The whole of Ireland is, for the moment, in a peaceful and undisturbed condition. The truce continues to be faithfully observed by both sides and the danger of its breaking down through the inability of the Sinn Fein leaders to main-tain an effective control over the rank and file of their followers would now appear to have passed. Although a few breaches have occurred they have been of a trivial and usually quite a technical character, and have in every case been disposed of promptly and satisfactorily. In the Martial Law Area certain friction has arisen between the Military and Sinn Fein liaison officers, owing to the latter being under the misapprehension that the truce necessarily carried with it the formal recognition of the belligerent status of the Irish Republican Army. The relations between the Police and Sinn Fein liaison officers in other parts of the country have been uniformly smooth and Successful, due, no doubt, to the fact that no question of the military status of the Irish Republican Army officers arises in their dealings with the Police, and it is therefore proposed to transfer all liaison duties to the Miartial Law Area from the Military to the Police, and so release Military officers from the invidious and embarrassing position of having to conduct such duties with men to whose pretensions to equivalent military rank and status they are compelled to refuse recognition.Under the conditions now prevailing it has been possible to reopen immediately a number of the branch railway lines which were closed in consequence of outrages, and this concession, together with the raising of curfew restrictions, has resulted in a notable revival of trade and industry throughout the country.I am glad to state that there has been no renewal of the Belfast disturbances which at one time threatened to endanger the truce in the Six Counties Area, and the leaders of all parties in Belfast now appear to be anxious to co-operate in preventing a further outbreak of disorder.Trials of Civilians by Court-Martial. /.Sentences in seventy-four Court Martial trials of civilians were promulgated during the week. The following is an analysis of the fifty-nine cases in.which convictions were obtained : 1 sentence of penal servitude for life. 35 sentences of penal servitude (3 years to 20 years). 12 sentences of imprisonment with hard labour (6 months to 2 years).1 sentence of imprisonment without hard labour (3 months). 10 fines (2/. to 3/.).Total  59 [61.921
The life sentence was imposed in a case of shooting with intent to murder, and sentence of twenty years&apos; penal servitude in three cases for the possession of arms and ammunition. Among the convictions was the case of a constable of the Royal Irish Constabulary charged with the larceny of a watch and sentenced to six months&apos; imprisonment with hard labour. Three other constables accused of housebreaking and robbery were acquitted.Internment Orders.The following statement shows the position as regards internments up to the 23rd instant.Orders madeOrders cancelled for reasons other than release Releases orderedNumber of persons now interned134 3823,795516 3,279The number of appeals now awaiting hearing is 39.

Present Political Situation in Ireland.Although the Sinn Fein leaders have as yet given no indications of their intentions in regard to the acceptance or rejection of the terms of settlement proposed by the Prime Minister to Mr. de Valera, the public confidence in the near advent of peace grows stronger every day. Since his return to Dublin on Friday (the 22nd instant) Mr. de Valera has been engaged in a number of conferences with the repre-sentatives of all sections of his supporters, and the Countess Markievicz, M.P., whose influence with the Women&apos;s Sinn Fein Organisation (the Cumman na m&apos;Ban) and with the extreme labour wing of the movement is still considerable, was released from prison, and Mr. Joseph McGrath, M.P., an important official of the Transport Workers&apos; Union, was released from internment in order that they might take part in the consultations. The secrecy of the &quot;terms of the Prime Minister&apos;s offer has been successfully kept so far as the general public are concerned, and the Dublin press has indulged in very little speculation as to their nature. The reticence of the press is no doubt the result of Sinn Fein injunctions, but the almost entire absence of any spontaneous public demonstration at a time when the future destinies of the Irish nation are awaiting decision is a singular phenomenon in a democratic country, and perhaps can only be explained by the general feeling that the issue of the leaders&apos; deliberations has already been placed beyond doubt by their knowledge that all classes and sections of the people have set their hearts upon peace.H irish Office, S.W. 1, July 29, 1921. &quot;    &apos; &apos;
