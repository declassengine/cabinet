PART I-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.The industrial situation has improved considerably during the week. A settlement of the dispute in the cotton textile industry was arrived at on the 24th June, and work was resumed, so far as the shortage of fuel allowed, on the 27th. An account is given below of the progress of the resumed negotiations in the coal mining industry which resulted in the provisional settlement of the 28th June. This settlement will be ratified by the miners&apos; executive on the 1st July if, as is expected, they receive the necessary authority from the districts.The ballot vote of the members of the unions concerned in the dispute in the engineering industry has resulted in the rejection of the employers&apos; proposals by 257,532 votes to 125,014, but, as reported below, a provisional agreement was arrived at on the morning of the 30th Jane. The continuance of negotiations in the dispute involving shipyard joiners is important, employment in the shipbuilding industry being seriously affected thereby.Particulars are given below of the proceedings of the 21st Annual Conference of the Labour Party, at Brighton, which terminated on the 24th June. The most important step taken by the conference, from the point of view of the future of the Labour movement in this country, appears to have been the approval of proposals for the formation of a National Joint Council representing the Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party and the Parliamentary Labour Party. Should the Trades Union Congress, in September, also approve the proposals, the political and industrial sides of the movement will then be provided with permanently established co-ordinating machinery. The endorsement by the conference of the executive&apos;s refusal of an application by the Communist Party for affiliation to the Labour Party has received much attention in^the Press, but, in this connection, it may be remarked that loyalty to parliamentary institutions was very noticeable, as might have been expected, throughout the whole proceedings of the conference, and this appears to have been the most important factor influencing the conference in their decision. Generally speaking, the conference appeared to be keenly alive to the difficulties of the present industrial situation ; this fact was particularly in evidence during the debate on the unemployment situation, the speeches in which showed a general appreciation of the fact that unemployment presents a difficult economic problem that can only be solved by hard constructive thinking; no particularly novel constructive suggestions, however, were brought forward by the conference. The strongest opposition was expressed to the provisions of the Corn Production Acts (Repeal) Bill.*The Unemployment Insurance Bill passed through the Report stage in the House of Commons on the 27th June, and received its third reading on the 28th. It will be read for the first and second times in the House of Jjords on the 29th, and pass through the remaining stages in that House on the 30th, and will probably receive Royal Assent on the 1st July,The Unemployment Position.Statistics.-On the 17th June, in the United Kingdom 2,150,653 unemployment books under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and out-of-work donation policies, remained lodged for workers totally unemployed, of which 1,597,373 were lodged by males and 553,280 by females. At the same date, 847,224 unemployment books and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers on short time, of which 504,210 were lodged by males and 343,014 by females. . These figures show a decrease on the previous week of 2,365 totally unemployed and 19,574 working short time.The total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 24th June was 2,178,000. The above are advanced figures provided by the Employment Department and are subject to revision.A full analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 12.* See p. 4 below; for the provisions of the Bill see p. 3 below.
FEATURES OF THE WEEK.General Topics.Com Production Acts (Repeal) Bill A Bill under this title was introduced into the House of Commons by the Minister of Agriculture on the 27th June. Its object is to repeal as from the 1st October next the Corn Production Acts, 19.17 and 1920, which guaranteed the prices of wheat and oats, and established minimum wage machinery for agriculture, through ,the operation of the Agricultural Wages Board, but it allows for guaranteed prices under those Acts in respect of crops of the current year Provision is also made for funds for agricultural development. The Bill contains clauses to promote the formation of voluntary joint conciliation councils and committees in place of the Agricultural Wages Board and District Wages Committees which it abolishes. The formation of such councils and committees for each county, on the lines of &quot; Whitley &quot; Councils, has recently been advocated by the National Farmers&apos; Union and the Central Landowners&apos; Association.Building Guilds. A report on the working of the building guilds has been published by Mr. Ernest Selley, of the Garden Cities and Town Planning Association, who has been making investigations to ascertain whether the guilds were making good their claims that industrial control by guild workers has been established, and that houses are being built better and more quickly and cheaply by the guilds than by private contractors. Mr. Selley is not connected with the guild movement, and it is claimed by the association that he is a skilled investigator of considerable experience. It is stated that he inspected guild housing contracts which are being carried out in various districts, and obtained information from foremen, architects, surveyors, borough councillors and members of housing com-mittees, as well as from, guildsmen and others not in official positions. Mr. Selley holds the view that complete democratic control by guild workers is made possible by the structure of the local committees and the central managing body, and he states that experience has shown that an efficient directorate can be chosen from, and selected by, the rank and file.As for the actual work carried out, Mr. Selley states that he found expert opinion unanimous in approving the output on guild schemes, some clerks of the works estimating it at 25 per cent, above the average ; and the quality of the work done is pronounced to be excellent. Men found to be slacking are liable to dismissal, but have the right, of appeal to the works committee or the union. It is stated, however, that there have been very few cases of dismissal. Mr. Selley states that the present situation may be summed up as follows: &quot; (1) The guilds have proved that they are organised on businesslike lines, and are able to carry out building operations in a workmanlike manner. (2) The quality of the work produced is distinctly - above the average. (3) The weight of evidence goes to show that the output per man on guild contracts is as good as that obtained by the best private contractors, and certainly higher than most. (4) It is not yet possible to make any definite statement as to comparative building costs, but, from the evidence obtained, there is ground for believing that the cost of building in guild contracts is likely to be lower than the average costs in the districts where the guilds are operating.&quot;At a meeting of the North-Western Federation of Building Trades&apos; Employers at Rochdale, on the 22nd June, there was a discussion of building guilds, which were con-demned. The president, Mr. Thomas Howarth, stated that it was an &quot;unconscionable thing that an experiment on such a huge scale should be made at the cost of the taxpayer, and that the guilds should be set up at the public expense.&quot; Mr. S. G. Hobson, in a letter to the Manchester Guardian of the 27th June, maintains, however, that the guilds have not caused any increased cost to the taxpayers, but that the local authorities are in debt to the guilds for work which has been well done at a less cost than would have been the case with a private contractor.Industrial and Other Organisations.Labour Party. The 21st annual conference of the Labour Party was held at Brighton from the 21st to 24th June. In the course of the consideration of the report of the Executive Committee, Mr. Hodges took the opportunity presented by a reference to the coal dispute to make a statement explaining the position of the miners, and a resolution in favour of financial support from the rest of the Labour movement was adopted. The report of the Executive Committee was discussed, and there was little criticism of the(b 17454T) A 2
Features of the Week-continued.paragraph dealing with the need for co-ordination of policy and effort within the move-ment, and the proposals for the formation of a national joint council of the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress, except as regards the Labour Research Department, upon which there was some debate. No decision could be arrived at, however, as nego-tiations with the department itself are still proceeding. The decision of the Executive Committee in refusing an application from the Communist Party for affiliation to the Labour Party was ratified by the conference. The abolition of the Agricultural Wages Board was considered, and a resolution was adopted, unanimously calling upon the Parliamentary Labour Party and local Labour organisations to use every means in their power to resist the Governments policy. It was announced that a conference to discuss the question of agriculture was to be called, and that organisations specially interested in agri-culture would be asked to send representatives. There was a discussion on the Governments Irish policy, which was condemned. Mr. Thomas, who was absent on his American visit, was strongly criticised in this connection because of an alleged speech in favour of Dominion Home Rule shortly after the last annual conference had decided against it. Resolutions demanding the revision of the Peace Treaties and protesting against an Anglo-French Alliance were also passed, and a motion demanding the repeal of the Emergency Powers Act was adopted. In this connection it was alleged that certain papers were circulating calumnious stories about members of the Government without any action being taken to refute or restrain them, the suggestion being that the powers conferred by the Act were not being used impartially.A further resolution was adopted without discussion denouncing any sort of alliance between the Labour Party and any section of the Liberal or Conservative Parties. The usual resolution on unemployment, calling for work or maintenance, and advocating schemes for industrial training, was passed after a debate in which reference to the con-ncction between the Reparation Clauses and unemployment was a salient feature.The new executive elected at the conference consists of 13 representatives of affiliated societies, namely, Messrs. F. Hodges, J. R. Clynes, Ben Turner, Sidney Webb, F. W. Jowett, A. G. Cameron, C. T. Cramp, W. H. Hutchinson, J. Bromley, C. Duncan, C. G. Ammon, F. B. Varley, and M. B. Farr; five representatives from local constituency organisations, namely, Messrs. Ben Spoor, G. Lansbury, Neil MacLean, R. J. Davis, and T. Shaw; and four women members, namely, Miss Susan Lawrence, Mrs. Harrison Bell, Mrs. Philip Snowden, and Dr. Ethel Bentham.The next conference will be held at Scarborough.Association of British Chambers of Commerce. The 61st annual meeting of the Asso-ciation was held at the Hotel Cecil on the 16th June, and was presided over by Mr. A. J. Hobson. The president, in his opening address, discussed the present state and future prospects of commerce and industry. He condemned the system of unemployment insurance, which he described as the &quot; endowment of idleness,&quot; and stated that some readjustment of wages was necessary at the present time. A resolution was adopted protesting against the action of Trade Boards in fixing rates which became practically maximum rates, and in fixing wages according to age. A motion was passed supporting the scheme of the Ministry of Labour for business training for ex-Service men, but objection was raised to the condition imposed that the training firm should guarantee the payment of a uniform rate at the end of training.It was decided to recommend to the authorities that bodies providing relief work should not be bound to pay the full trade union rate of wages under unemployment schemes. It was also decided that there could be &quot;no lasting improvement in the position of the wage-earners and no steady prosperity in the country until Labour recognised the fact that the only basis for the determination of wages was the basis of output.&quot;Sir A. Shirley Benn, M.P., was elected to succeed Mr. Hobson as president of the association.NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Engineers (National).-l:h.e ballot vote on the employers&apos; proposals for reductions in wages, referred to in last week&apos;s issue of this Report, resulted in their rejection by 257,532 votes to 125,014. This result was made known to a delegate meeting of the unions concerned, held in London on the 29th June, and further meetings took place
between the Negotiating Committees of both sides on the 29th and 30th. The employers expressed the opinion that owing to the present state of trade the following reductions, in the three stages indicated, were essential :-(1) 3s. per week on time-rates and 7  per cent, on piece-work&quot;]prices. ^ Being the amounts awarded under(2) 3s. per week on time-rates and 11 per cent, on piece-work f  Award No. 180 of 10th March,prices. &quot; J   1920.(3) \2\ per cent.&apos; and 7  per cent., being Ministry of Munitions bonuses.They made the reservation, however, that with regard to the third stage they agreed to &quot;meet the unions in conference in September to discuss whether the state and prospects of trade as at that date have so altered as to warrant a modification in the amount, and also to fix a period over which it should be spread.&quot;The representatives of the unions could not accept the &quot; opinion &quot; of the employers, but were prepared to recommend that the first proposed reduction should be given effect to on the 15th July, the second on the 15th August, and the third should be reviewed at the conference in September. These recommendations of the representatives of the unions were submitted to a delegate meeting of the unions concerned on the 30th, and were approved. The delegate meeting and the employers&apos; representatives also agreed to recommend their constituent bodies and local associations to accept them.Woollen Textile Trades (Scotland). Negotiations are proceeding between representa-tives of the Scottish Woollen Trade Employers&apos; Association and representatives of the trade unions concerned in the South of Scotland wool trade, with a view to a reduction in wages. It is understood that the employers proposed a 20 per cent, reduction in wages, which has subsequently been modified to a reduction ranging between 16 per cent, and 17 per cent. The operatives&apos; representatives are of opinion that the proposed reduction is too drastic, and consider that the only increases which should be withdrawn are those conceded by Awards Nos. 403 and 404 of the Industrial Court, of the 19th July, 1920. These awards provided that the increases of men time-workers, over 21 years of age, amount-ing to 32s. for a full ordinary week over the individual pre-war weekly earnings, should be raised to 38s.; that the increase to women workers over 18 years of age, of 24s. a week over the individual pre-war weekly earnings, should be raised to 28s.; and that piece-workers should have their percentage increased to 145 per cent, on their pre-war general district average earnings.Hide and Skin Workers (Liverpool). Employees of Liverpool hide and skin brokers have held a meeting and decided to reject the employers&apos; proposals for a reduction of Is. per day, and an increase of hours from 47 J to 51 \ per week. They have made a counter-proposal, offering an increase in hours from 47f to 50, if the employers will continue paying on the old rate of  3 6s. a week.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Shipyard Joiners (National). This strike which has lasted since the 1st December, 1920, continues. A further meeting between representatives of the Shipbuilding Em-ployers&apos; Federation and the executive council of the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers is to take place at Edinburgh on the 30th June. The last meeting between these bodies appears to have been on the 24th May.*Meetings were also held in London on the 10th and the 16th June between repre-sentatives of the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation and the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades, but negotiations were adjourned after the second meeting without a decision being arrived at.Settlements and Agreements,Coal Miners (National). The following are the chief events of the week leading up to the provisional settlement of this dispute, which was reached on the 28th June.The miners&apos; executive met in London on the 24th June, when the general situation was reviewed. Correspondence from the unions who had&apos;been invited to consider joint action with the miners was discussed, but, in view of the nature of the replies received, it was decided that the proposed joint meeting should be cancelled. The executive then decided to meet the owners and the Government with a view to arriving at a satisfactory wages agreement which the executive could recommend to their members for acceptance. This decision was communicated to the Government and the owners at the conclusion of the meeting, and on the following day a letter was received from the Prime Minister requesting that the miners&apos; executive should attend a joint meeting with the Government* See this Eeport, Vol. Ill, No. 22, 28thMay, p. 458.
and the owners at the Board of Trade on the 27th. This invitation was accepted; and the joint conference was opened by the Prime Minister who shortly afterwards withdrew. The miners and owners, however, remained in consultation, both separately and together, throughout the day, meeting the Prime Minister again at 10 p.m. Negotiations were continued on the 28th, when a provisional settlement was agreed upon. A difficulty arose in connection with the withdrawal of the Governments original offer of a subsidy of  10,000,000 to the industry, but it was ultimately agreed that the offer should be renewed, subject to the consent of the House of Commons.The agreement, which is subject to ratification by the districts of the Miners&apos; Federa-tion, consists of 13 clauses, and a schedule showing the 13 districts into which the coalfields are to be divided for the purposes of the agreement. The first 1.0 clauses of the agreement deal with the general principles under which wages will be settled during the period in which the agreement will be in force; and a long clause (Clause 1.1.) deals with the position during the &quot; temporary period,&quot; that is, the period from the date of the resumption of work to the 30th September, 1921. During this temporary period &quot; the Government will give a grant not exceeding  10,000,000 in subvention of wages &quot; for the purpose of making such increases &quot; to the wages otherwise payable in any district. as may be necessary to prevent the reductions below the March rates of wages being greater than the following amounts :-During July : 2s. a shift for persons of 16 years of age and upwards, and Is. a shift for persons under 16 ; during August, 2s. Qd. and Is. 3d. respec-tiyely; during September, 3s. and Is. Qd. respectively, provided that the balance of the subvention is sufficient for this purpose.&quot; Provision is also made during the temporary period for the calculation of costs other than wages; the disposal of surplus proceeds; the calculation of wages in districts where the proceeds available for wages are equal to or greater than the rate payable under the temporary scheme; and payments by the owners from profits in those districts where the wages calculated are less than the wages payable under the scheme.The principal permanent clauses of the agreement provide : That a National Board and District Boards, consisting of equal numbers of persons repre-senting owners and workmen, shall be established forthwith, with an independent chairman for each Board.The wages payable in each district shall be expressed in the form of a percentage upon the basis rates prevailing in the district, and shall be periodically adjusted in accordance with the proceeds of the industry as ascertained in each district.The amount of the percentage to be paid in each district during any period shall be determined by the proceeds of the industry in that district during a previous period, as ascertained by returns to be made by the owners, checked by joint test audit of the owners&apos; books carried out by independent accountants appointed by each side.The sum to be applied in each district to the payment of wages above the standard wages as defined, shall be a sum equal to 83 per cent, of the surplus of such proceeds remaining after deduction therefrom of the cost of the standard wages ; the costs of production other than wages, and standard profits equal to 17 per cent, of the cost of standard wages ; the share of the surplus applicable to wages shall be expressed as a percentage upon the basis rates prevailing in the district. Where the proceeds in any period have been insufficient to meet the standard profits the deficiency shall be a first charge on this surplus. The National.Board shall forthwith consider what items are to be included in costs of production other than wages, and in the event of agreement not being arrived at by 31st July, the matter is to be referred to the independent Chairman for decision.If the rates of wages thus determined in any district do not provide a subsistence wage to low-paid day-wage workers, such additions in the form of allowances per shift worked shall be made for that period as may be necessary for the purpose.The standard wages shall be the district basis rates existing on 31st March, 1921, plus the district percentages payable in July, 1914 (or the equivalents in any district in which there has been a subsequent merging into new standards); plus, in the case of pieceworkers, the percentage additions which were made consequent upon the reduction of hours from eight to seven.In no district shall wages be paid at lower rates than standard wages plus 20 per cent, thereof. &apos;.The wages payable by the owners up to 31st August inclusive, shall be based upon the ascer-tained results of the month of March, and the wages payable during September shall be based upon the ascertained results of the month of July. The periods of ascertainment thereafter shall be decided by the National Board. . -The period of duration of the agreement is from the date of the resumption of work until the 30th September, 1922, and thereafter until terminated by three months&apos; notice on either side. Provision is also made for the return of men to their work as soon as possible, and the protection of those men who had been keeping the collieries open.It is expected that the agreement will be signed on the 1st July, and that work will be resumed on the 4th.
Plumbers (Grantham). As the result of a conference between the G-rantham Master Builders&apos; Association and the Grantham building trade operatives, on the 20th June, with a reference to a demarcation dispute in connection with the housing scheme, which had resulted in a cessation of work on the 6th June, a resolution was adopted in the following terms: &quot; It is hereby agreed between the Grantham Master Builders&apos; Association and the Grantham Building Trade Operatives&apos; Federation that the following rule shall be added to the present local &quot;working rules: &quot; All w,ork in connection with gas services and fittings in all houses and buildings in the borough of Grantham shall be carried out by the plumbers, who shall be paid the standard rate of wages appertaining to the building trade.&quot;*This resolution has been communicated by the plumbers to their executive committee. Pending the decision of that committee, work has been resumed and the gas company have agreed to withdraw their fitters from the housing scheme for seven days.Cotton Textile Workers (National). As indicated in last week&apos;s issue of this Eeport, the Joint Negotiating Committee met in. Manchester on the 24th June. An agreement embodying acceptance of the. employers&apos; terms by the operatives&apos; organisations concerned, namely, the spinners, the weavers and the cardroom workers, was then signed by the chairman and the secretary of each organisation represented on the Negotiating Committee ; the mills re-opened on the 27th June. It is announced that short time will continue to be worked until a decision to the contrary is taken, and, in this connection, the General Committee of the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations, Ltd., will take the earliest opportunity of discussing the question of the state of trade, and of making a recommendation to the members as to the future working of the mills.It is reported that cotton operatives in Yorkshire resumed work on the 21st June in all the mills which were able to restart. The only mills remaining closed are those which are not at present in possession of fuel.Road Transport Workers (National). A joint conference was held at the Ministry of Labour on the 3rd June between representatives of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation and the National Federation of Road Transport Employers, to discuss the setting up of machinery to deal with adjustment of wages in the industry. A sub-committee representative of both sides was then appointed to investigate conditions in the industry and to report at a future date. On the 23rd June, the national delegate meeting of the trade unions concerned met in London, and was adjourned until the next day in order that the Negotiating Committee might meet the employers. This meeting was duly held, and the basis of an agreement to regulate the wages of carters and motormen was arrived at, and submitted to the delegate meeting which authorised the federation officials to sign the agreement.  The terms will be made public at a later date.Road Transport Workers (Bradford, Halifax, Nottingham, Leeds, Huddersfield and KeigUey). An agreement for a reduction of wages has been reached between the Bradford and District Commercial Vehicle OAvners&apos; Federation and the Bradford Branch of the United Road Transport Workers&apos; Association of England. The reductions, which came into operation in the week ending the 11th June, vary from 3s. to 7s. per week. The Halifax and District Horse and Motor Owners&apos; Association and the Halifax Carters&apos; and Draymen&apos;s and Horsemen&apos;s Association have also agreed upon reductions varying from 7s. to 9s. per week, to come into force on the first pay-day in June. At a meeting of the North Midland Road Board, which operates in the Nottingham area, on the 6th June, an agreement was reached whereby the increase of 4s. per week granted in January last will be withdrawn in two instalments, dating from, the first and third pay-days in June, respectively.In addition to the foregoing agreements, a reduction of 7s. per week has been put into force in Leeds, Huddersfield and Keighley, operating from the first pay-day in June.[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Industrial Relations Departments section of the Report, pages 8 to 10.]
PART IL-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DEPARTMENT.BUILDING AND WORKS OF CONSTRUCTION.Building Trade Operatives (Okehampton).-0ii the 17th May, building trade operatives struck at Okehampton in resistance to the employers&apos; decision to reduce wages by 2d. an hour and to increase the working hours by four per week. Of about 80 operatives originally affected, 36 resumed work on the employers&apos; terms before the 26th May. Con-ferences arranged by a representative of the department were held, when the workmen agreed to accept the employers&apos; terms. Work was resumed on the 6th June. The rates now in operation are Is. 6d. per hour for tradesmen, and Is. 3d. per hour for labourers, for a 48-hour week.MINING AND QUARRYING.Quarrying : Freestone Section. An agreement was reached on the 16th June, between the Yorkshire Freestone Quarry Owners and the unions concerned, as follows :-An immediate reduction of 3d. per hour for all grades of workmen, and a corresponding reduction in piece-rates, the rates to remain in operation until the 29th July.As from the 29th July, the adoption of the building trade sliding scale for the regulation of wages, on the basis of Id. per hour reduction for every 13 points drop in the cost of living, or \d. per hour for every 6  points, the basis line being 170 points. The first revision in the sliding scale to come into operation on the 29th July, with subsequent revisions every three months.The question of working hours and grading of men to be referred to the Yorkshire Area Council.The original demand of the employers was for 5d. per hour reduction for labourers and 4d. per hour reduction for masons. It is understood that the Workers&apos; Union only accept the three-monthly agreement as a temporary expedient, and intend to press for adjustment at a longer interval.FOOD AND DRINK.Fishing Industry. A conference was held on the 6th June between representatives of the department and of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, with a view to co-ordination -ing the work of the two departments in connection with labour questions in the fishing industry. It was agreed that action by way of conciliation in accordance with the Industrial Courts Act should be taken by the representative of the Ministry of Labour, but that the local officers of both departments should establish and maintain contact in any question that may arise.   The Chief Conciliation Officers have been informed accordingly.The possibility of establishing Joint Industrial Councils for the industry was discussed, but it was decided that, in view of the state of trade and the insufficient organisation on both sides, no attempts in this direction should be made for the present.Brewery Workers (North Midlands).--The assistance of the department has been given to further negotiations to reconstitute the Joint Industrial District Council for Indoor Brewery Workers, Beer Bottlers and Maltsters, for the North Midland area, so as to include representatives of brewery transport workers. A Conciliation Officer has interviewed the secretary of the Council, and attended the last meeting of the Council. He reports that the area of this Council is limited at present, to Nottinghamshire, excluding Newark, and to Derbyshire, the Newark and Northampton employers having resigned. No representatives of the employers from the other districts affiliated to the Council have attended since February, as they considered that the advance of 6s. given in December, 1920, was too high. The employers still represented on the Council, who are members of the National Trade Defence Association, have withdrawn from the North Midland Road Transport Board, as they wish to deal with all their workers on one Council. The labour side of the Council consists of representatives of the National Union of General Workers and the Workers&apos; Union.  An informal conference has been held between these representatives
Industrial Relations Department-continued.and those of the United Vehicle Workers, with the object of including representatives of the latter body on this Council. It has been left for the United Vehicle Workers to decide, before the next meeting, whether they will officially apply for representation.At the last meeting of the Council, on the -14th June, the workers&apos; side accepted a reduction of 4s. per week for adult males, and 2s. per week for adult females and for youths. These reductions are to cover all brewery workers, the reduction for brewery transport workers to be considered as that agreed on by the Transport Workers&apos; North Midland Conciliation Board, which has not hitherto been put into operation by the brewery employers represented on this Council.Brewers (Scarborough). The Chief Conciliation Officer, Leeds, reports that, with the assistance of the department, a settlement has been arrived at in this dispute, to the effect that wages should be stabilised until the 30th September, and that a month&apos;s notice on either side should be given to terminate the agreement.POTTERY, RUBBER AND GLASS.Rubber Manufacturing. At a meeting of the India Rubber Manufacturers&apos; Association, on the 16th June, the London section opposed the agreement concerning labourers in Lancashire and Cheshire arrived at by the Rubber Heel Sectional Joint Council. The Association therefore declined to ratify the agreement.The question of reviving the Joint Industrial Council was considered at the general meeting of the India Rubber Manufacturers&apos; Association, on the 21st June. It was decided that there was no advantage to be gained by such a step at the present time.Glass. It is reported in the Press that the general financial secretary of the National -Flint Glass Makers&apos; Society, at Dudley on the 17th June, &quot; stated that the society was in the most serious position it had ever been in since its inauguration in 1848. Ninety per cent, of the members were unemployed, and more than 50 per cent, of the accumulated funds of the society had been exhausted in unemployment allowances.&quot; This may be the explanation of the withdrawal of the society from the National and Sectional Councils for the industry.GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.War Department. Progress in forming works committees has been slower under the War Department than under other Government departments, owing to special difficulties, arising chiefly from the change from war to peace conditions. On the 22nd June a deputa-tion from the Council attended conferences, convened in accordance with the procedure laid down in the official scheme, at the department of the Chief Inspector of Small Arms, Enfield Lock, the Royal Small Arms Factory, Enfield Lock, and the Royal Gunpowder Factory, Waltham Abbey. Considerable discussion took place at all three conferences. In the case of the Small Arms Factory, the matter is to some extent complicated by the existence of a committee set up at the beginning of this year by the management, and elected by the employees, irrespective of whether they are trade unionists or not. , The constitution, therefore, is at variance with the whitley scheme. In the two other depart-ments, works committees, in accordance with the scheme, are to be established forthwith.PROFESSIONAL WORKERS.Entertainments.-The Executive Committee of the Industrial Council met on the 24th June. A communication from the department, enclosing a letter to the Minister from the Scottish Council of Women&apos;s Trades relative to the alleged low wages paid to cinema attendants in Scotland, was considered, and it was agreed to refer the letter tpithe Cinema Exhibitors&apos;Association for their observations.With regard to the resignation from the Council of the Theatrical Managers&apos; Association and the Association of Touring Managers, and the threatened resignation of certain other bodies, a resolution was passed recommending to the Council that the Ministry should be requested to convene separate conferences of the constituent organisations on both sides, with a view to the reconstitution of the Council. It was agreed that the Conciliation Board, which had been appointed to consider the present wages position in London variety theatres, and, whose proceedings had been suspended owing to a misunderstanding, caused by the London District Committee of the National Association of Theatrical Employees concluding a separate agreement with an individual employer, should meet again and give a decision.(b 17454T) V B
Industrial Relations Department--continued.It was pointed out that the action of the District Committee of. the National Association of Theatrical Employees was not in accordance with the policy of the executive of that body.MISCELLANEOUS TRADES.Cricket Ball Manufacturers (Toribridge). Arrangements have been, made for work to be resumed on the 27th June, and the difference lias been referred to the Industrial Court for arbitration.Bone Cutters [Sheffield). After a meeting on the 21st June, the employers informed the union that the proposed 15 per cent, reduction must operate on and from the 1st June. This decision is being placed before the men.Gas Mantles. The Industrial Council met on the 20th June. The chairman reported that, as the outcome of an interview with Mr. Clynes on the subject of the Safeguarding of Industries Bill, it was understood that arrangements would be made for a deputation of the Council to be received by the President of the Board of Trade. Exception was taken to the alleged action of the National Gas Council in endeavouring to obtain the exclusion of gas mantles from the scope of the Bill. A prolonged discussion followed on the further measures to be taken by the Council to safeguard the industry, and it was finally decided to circularise Trades Councils with the object of representations being made to the municipal authorities to purchase only British-made mantles.The chairman announced that, in view of the continued decrease in the cost of living, it was proposed to make a reduction in wages which would necessitate the withdrawal of the advances granted in September, 1920, with a consequent reversion to the rates provided under the Agreement of March, 1920. The proposal, which was ultimately agreed to, involves a reduction of \\d. per hour in the case of men and Id. per hour in the case of women, with proportionately lower rates for junior workers, a reduction of about 11 per cent. The employers stated that they intended to postpone putting these reductions into force until the latest possible date.[Reference to matters of interest m connection with Industrial Relations will be found also on $ages 2 to 7, 10 to 12, and 16.]GENERAL DEPARTMENT.TRADE BOARDS.PROCEEDINGS.Cotton Waste Reclamation Trade Board [Great Britain). The Board agreed to make representations to the Minister for the extension of their scope to include the operation of willowing when carried on separately.The Board considered the report of the District Trade Committee for Scotland, on the variation set out in the Notice dated the 13th April, 1921, and agreed to vary the rates as proposed, recommending the 9th July as the date from which the Minister should make them effective.The Board received a report from the Negotiating Committee on the question of the adoption of a sliding scale, and agreed to adopt the scale as proposed, the Board to give effect to the scale by the usual method of proposal to vary. Subject to the present variation being made effective, the Board further agreed to propose fresh reductions of the rates in accordance with the sliding scale as adopted, and to apply to the Minister for his consent.Flax and Hemp Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board decided to recommend the Minister to amend the definition of the Board so as to include oilers, sweepers and thread manufacturers. The advisability of including certain other branches of the trade within the definition was referred to the Administrative Committee.The Board resolved to give Notice of Proposal to vary the general minimum time-rates at present fixed, by a reduction of 12j per cent, in the case of adult female workers and 10 per cent, in the case of juvenile workers, and to fix a piece-work basis time-rate

Twine and Net Trade Board (Great Britain).--The Board agreed to classify male and female workers employed in the rope, twine and net trade into four grades, and to propose rates for adult workers accordingly. It was also agreed to vary the general minimum piece-rates in accordance with the variations proposed in the general minimum time-rates and piece-work basis time-rates.FIXING AND VARIATION OF MINIMUM RATES OF WAGES.Brush and Broom Trade Board (Great Britain). The Minister has made an Order, dated the 20th June, confirming the minimum rates, as varied by an alteration of the conditions attaching thereto, for male apprentices in the bone brush section of the trade, and has specified the 21st June as the date from which the rates are effective.Corset Trade Board.

Women.	Boys.	Girls.

There has been no substantial increase in unemployment during the week, but, as the hopes entertained in regard to the early settlement of the coal stoppage failed to materialise, it is feared that firms who have been retaining their employees in expectation of a settlement will have to restrict their working hours still further.The following are the principal changes reported..: Men&apos;s Employment.Iron and Steel. In Scotland a firm of engineers and ironfounders at Paisley have resumed full-time working, and at Partick, the British Hydraulic Foundry Co., Ltd., have increased their working time to four days per week. At Renfrew 1,500 men have been thrown idle by a fire at the works of Messrs. Babcock &amp; Wilcox, Ltd., but it is antici-pated that the majority will be able to resume in about 10 days.Practically all large works in the Tyneside and Wearside areas closed for the Newcastle race week. At Consett more men have been re-employed on reconstructing plant at the works of the Oonsett Iron Co., Ltd. On the other hand, at Middlesbrough the closing down of the engineering and construction departments of Messrs. Dorman, Long &amp; Co., Ltd., has resulted in the discharge of 900 men, and at Stockton, 150 workpeople are affected by the closing down of an engineering works. In the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division, a slight decrease in the live register is reported from Attercliffe, due in a measure to small supplies of coal coming through. At Ilkeston 116 workmen, principally moulders and foundry labourers, have been put off by the Stanton Ironworks Co., Ltd.In the West Midlands Division 600 men are affected at Bilston by the closing down of the boiler works of Messrs. John Thompson, Ltd., owing to lack of fuel. Further restrictions in working hours by firms in the Smethwick district are reported. In. the South Midlands and Eastern Division, 100 men have been discharged by the Crittall Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Braintree. At Luton, the Skefko Ball Bearing Co., Ltd., have closed down for three weeks.
Employment and Insurance Department-continued.Most iron and tinplate works in &quot;Wales are at a standstill, but the Ebbw Vale Steel &amp; Iron Co., Ltd., have commenced to put their blast-furnaces in order so that operations can be started at any time.Shipbuilding and Allied Industries. On the Clyde there is a decided lull in all shipyards, and the number of unemployed workers is steadily increasing. On the Tyne and Wear, most firms have closed until the 4th July. A slight improvement in repair work is reported from Willington Quay, and on the Tees a big repair job at West Hartlepool has absorbed a fair number of men.On the Mersey, the activity in the repairing yards reported from Bootle during the past few weeks continues, and has resulted in a further reduction of the live register. At Garston, Messrs. H. &amp; C. Grayson, Ltd., are expected to resume normal time again, the restrictions on the supply of electric power having been removed. The present labour troubles, however, are making it impossible for firms to guarantee delivery, or to quote prices for overhauling and repairing, with the result that many contracts are being diverted to the Continent. In South Wales, repair work at Newport has declined, but more activity is reported from Swansea.Textiles and Clothing. In the cotton trade the prospects are regarded as good, and a much better feeling exists, consequent on increased orders for abroad and the numerous inquiries received. Full advantage cannot, however, be taken of this improvement until coal supplies are adequate.Under-employment, due primarily to trade depression, and in a measure to shortage of fuel, is still the feature of the woollen trade. Inquiries for quotations, however, are more numerous, and, with the coal difficulty removed, it is felt in some quarters that there may bean appreciable brightening of trade. The signs of a revival of the lace trade are still apparent, and in Nottingham fairly substantial orders have been received. In the boot and shoe trade the improvement reported from Northampton is continuing, and at Stafford all boot factories are on full time.Transport.-Employment for dockers on the Mersey is very casual, and there is no immediate prospect of an improvement. There is a greater demand, however, for motor drivers from haulage contractors and, charabanc owners. At Avonmouth there is a fairly steady flow of employment for dockers unloading grain boats. On the Thames, work at Tilbury Docks is slackening, and very little employment has been available. Slackness at the Surrey Commercial Docks also continues, and the prospects of the absorp-tion of surplus labour are unfavourable.Miscellaneous Trades. More employment has been available in the pottery industry as the result of several firms obtaining supplies of coal. Messrs. Pilkington Bros., Ltd., St. Helens, have resumed glass casting.At Cambridge the Saxon branch of the British Portland Cement Co., Ltd., have re-opened their works, and the Norman branch is expected to re-open shortly, as a supply of coal is in transit.In the fishing industry a few boats are putting to sea from Wick, but the results are meagre and the quality of fish poor. At Fleetwood, the number of dock hands and firemen on the register has decreased by 102. The position at Grimsby is also more favourable, 270 fishermen having obtained berths during the week. Most vessels from this port are proceeding to the Continent for coal, and after a delay of some days are able to proceed to sea. At Milford Haven the majority of boats are laid up for want of coal, and very little fish is being landed.In the Metropolitan area, unemployment/in the leather, tin box and food products trades is very acute, but in the building trade the demand for bricklayers and plasterers is still good.  More activity is also noticeable in the decorating trade.Women&apos;&apos;s Employment.Local Reports. The North-Western Division report that all prospects of a general trade revival depend upon the settlement of &apos;the dispute in the cotton industry and the resumption of Work in the mines. A number of non-federated cotton firms in the division are not affected by the dispute. Employees of these firms are being paid benefit after information that work is being carried on as usual has been confirmed. The prevailing depression is reflected in all the distributive trades, from which many women are being discharged.
Employment and Insurance Department-continued.A marked improvement is noted in the hatting industry at Denton, and the glove manufacturing trade at Glossop also shows slight improvement.In the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division there are signs of improvement in the hosiery, boot, and clothing trades, but there is still marked depression in the woollen textile centres. There is a slightly more optimistic feeling in Long Eaton, Beeston and Basford in regard to the lace industry.In the South Midlands and Eastern Division the slight improvements reported in the boot and hosiery industries appear to be maintained. The live registers, however, remain high in the more important centres. A large number of women have been employed by Messrs. Chivers &amp; Son, Ltd., Histon, for jam making, and an order has been received at the Cambridge Exchange for 100 fruit pickers. The local supply has been exceeded, and it is hoped to import workers from neighbouring Exchanges.In London the depression continues, and high registers are maintained in the industrial areas.Grave and unabated unemployment is reported from the West Midlands Division in the staple and subsidiary trades. The Northern Division report that registers are decreasing, owing to a large number of claims by married women being disallowed.Scotland state that there are indications that, with the conclusion of the coal strike, there will be a fairly general improvement in the state of employment. Improved condi-tions are already reported in the hosiery trade, but there is still considerable unemployment in the textile industries. The Aberdeen Exchange report that the herring season has commenced, and it is hoped that many orders will shortly be received for kipperers. Firms engaged in the white fish and salt fish trades state that the demand is seriously affected by the severe unemployment throughout the country.LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Employment. The Selby Committee suggest that Local Employment Committees might be allowed to use their discretion in allowing a preference to married civilians before single ex-Service men without dependants.Unemployment Insurance. The Goole Committee are of opinion that, in some respects, the regulations relating to unemployment benefit are unwise, and tend to discourage the search for work. They recommend that when a person has put in his three waiting days, he should become entitled to benefit afterwards, provided he has not worked more than, say, 8j hours between one period of unemployment and another. They suggest that the Fund loses more by the present continuity rule than it would do under their proposed amendment, as, in their opinion, a large number of workpeople deliberately abstain from seeking work on the third or fourth day of continuous unemployment, realising that by obtaining employment for perhaps half a day, for which they may receive from 5s. to 8s.. they lose 10s. unemployment benefit or more.DISCHARGED AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS,National Scheme. Up to and including the 21st June, 26,502 certificates have been issued to employers under the Scheme. The undertakings given by these employers covered 290,796 disabled ex-Service men.The Divisional Controller of the South-Western Division reports that only 54 disabled men have been placed in employment during the last month. General trade depression is responsible for this very low figure, and there appears to be little hope of any increase until the position improves. The total on the live register for the division is now 1.020, which is a decrease of 26 on the previous period. This total includes many men almost unemployable on account of their severe disabilities.JUVENILE BRANCH.Centres for Unemployed Juveniles. During the week ending the 15th June, 15 approved centres for unemployed juveniles were open in Great Britain, the attendance being nearly 2,000. The West Midlands, Yorkshire and East Midlands and Northern Divisions are still without an approved centre.; [Reference to matters of interest to the Employment and Insurance Department will, also be found on pages 2, 4, 7 and&apos;16.]
APPOINTMENTS AND TRAINING.APPOINTMENTS AND CIVIL LIABILITIES DEPARTMENT.APPOINTMENTS.Statistics. During the week ending the 17th June the department placed 264 candi-dates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 56,109. Of these, 7,250 have been placed through the agency of the departments Interviewing Boards. Applications were registered from 587 ex-Service men and 28 civilians. The number of candidates available for appointments on the 17th June was 11,889 ex-Service men and 1,309 civilians. At the same date 810 live vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 317 having been registered during the week.BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.Business Training Scheme. During the week ending the 17th June, the department received no applications for training under this scheme. The total number of applications received is 3,295, of which 1,925 have since been cancelled. Grants have been sanctioned in 839 cases. At the same date, 157 vacancies were at the disposal of the department, four having been registered during the week.Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The deportment have dealt with a total of 1,245 cases, in 555 of which the training sanctioned is provided by the Appointment Department, and in the remainder by other Government departments. Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed training in 352 cases, and abandoned training in 47 ; 122 are still in training, and 34 are awaiting training.TRAINING DEPARTMENT. INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other ExsService Men.Statistics. On the 21st June, 23,633 men were in training, as against 23,668 on the 14th June, and 24,349 on the 24th May. During the week 345 men were placed in training. There were 16,725 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 14th June and the 24th May being 16,743 and 16,426. The number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 34,132, the totals for the 14th June and the 24th May being 33,752 and 32,243.Exhibitions.-An exhibition of work by men in training in tailoring at Bradford was held on the 1st June, in order to attract the attention of employers. Of the 18 men who form this class, seven have suffered the loss of a leg. There was a good attendance of master tailors and of the general public, and good results are hoped for.Space was allotted to the department, free of charge, by the organiser of the National Efficiency Exhibition, Manchester, which opened on the 31st May. Exhibits were arranged in tailoring, boot and shoe making, clogging, vehicle-building, carpentry and joinery, wood carving, cabinet making, monumental masonry, fibrous plastering, draughtsmanship, mechanical engineering, dental mechanics, painting and decorating, and turkey rug weaving. government Instructional Factories. At the Camden Town Factory there are now just under 450 men in training in the vehicle-building trade. The work here is entirely of a productive nature. A special feature in the coach-painting section is a class of one-armed men, who are capable of going through the whole course without assistance.The existing courses a,t the New Basford Factory, where there are over 300 men in training, will shortly be transferred to Derby. At the end of May the approximate value of contracts in hand at New Basford amounted to  1,200 and at Derby to  800.Premises at 69, Great Eastern Street, E.C., have been taken over by H.M. Office of Works on behalf of the Ministry, and will be considered as an annexe of the Tanner Street Factory, Bermondsey.
Appointments and Training-continued.National Trade Advisory Committees: Furniture. A meeting was held at St. Ermins on the 15th June. Application from the Ministry of Pensions for approval of training at the Convalescent Centre at Ducldington was given in principle ; the question of the numbers to be trained was referred to the Edinburgh Local Technical Advisory Committee.Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics. LTp to the 22nd June, agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 46,477 apprentices, under the 41 schemes approved. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 44,323 apprentices, employed by 17,625 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agree-ment between the parties, is now 26,895.Non-Observance of Conditions. It is reported by local headquarters for the South-Western area, that, with the increase in the number of apprentices whose period of renewed training has terminated, further evidence is forthcoming as to failure on the part of employers to pay the rates of the scheme. In certain instances, apprentices remain silent until they have completed their apprenticeship, or until they have transferred to a new employer.Trade Disputes. Local headquarters for the Northern area report that inquiries have been received during the week from Messrs. Parsons&apos; Marine Steam Turbine Co., Ltd., Wallsend, Messrs. C. A. Parsons &amp; Co., Ltd., Heaton, and other engineering concerns, as to the position of apprentices under the scheme, should a lock-out or strike take place in the engineering industry. The district secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering Union has given an assurance that such apprentices will not be interfered with in any wTay.Unemployment. A report from the South-Western area states that there is a substantial increase in the number of apprentices placed on short time owing to the lack of work, and that the number of apprentices desiring institutional training is in excess of the accommoda-tion at the departments disposal.Employers suspending apprentices in many cases do not notify local headquarters of the fact. , Arrangements have therefore been made in the Northern area for all Employment Exchanges to exhibit notices asking apprentices under the scheme to give particulars when they draw unemployment benefit. This information will be forwarded to the Chief Local Officer, who will give immediate attention to such cases.General Training.Apprenticeship : Building. A further meeting of the Leamington, Warwick and District Apprenticeship Committee was held on the 8th June, and discussed the terms of the proposed indenture. As the result of two joint conferences of employers and operatives at Newark-on-Trent and Worksop, the scheme has in each case been adopted, and apprentice-ship committees are to be formed.In the South Midlands and Eastern area, apprenticeship committees have now been established in six important centres, and in three others it is expected that committees will be formed. Oxford are awaiting the decision of the Southern Counties Joint Area Council in regard to the apprenticeship question. The position in Wales is now more promising; joint conferences are pending at Haverfordwest, Carmarthen and Llanelly, and the interest of the operatives at Aberdare and Pontypool has extended to the master builders. vAt Taunton, the president of the master builders&apos; association recognises that there are possibilities in the scheme apart from the question of recruitment, which has been quite adequate in the past, and has arranged for a meeting to be called. The president of the employers&apos; federation for Chester, however, is reluctant to take similar action, although it is acknowledged that the local scheme in operation is not as comprehensive as the National Scheme.Difficulty is experienced at Plymouth in bringing the two sides together owing to recent differences on other matters within the industry.[References to matters of interest to the Appointments and Training Departments will also be found on pages 4 and 14.] ,
