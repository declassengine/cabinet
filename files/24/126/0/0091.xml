This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.SECRET.CP. 3189 n n-61THE CABINET.PROTECTION OF EXPLOSIVES AND MUNITION DEP6TS.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I cannot agree with the recommendation made in the Home Secretary&apos;s Memorandum CP. 3110 that a small section of the Defence Force should be retained or revived for the protection of explosives and munition depdts. To accept this proposal would be to admit the principle that the armed forces of the Crown are charged with the protection of civil property, a duty which falls primarily on the civil police, and this at a time when, as is stated in the Protection Sub-Committee&apos;s Report appended to the Home Secretary&apos;s note, the military forces are so reduced that even military stores and barracks cannot be adequately guarded.L. W.-E.The Wau Office,3rd August, 1921.
