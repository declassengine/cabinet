This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.SECRET, 20 i /k    CP. 3118.THE CABINET.ARMY FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSED CHANGEIN THE STATUS OF EGYPT.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.Several financial questions of importance requiring settlement with the Egyptian     79 Government were laid before the Cabinet in a memorandum (CP. 1536) by my   Egypt predecessor, dated 25th June, 1920.   These are materially affected by the Report of     65 Lord Milner&apos;s Mission, and other matters of financial importance also call for notice in connection with the negotiations with the Egyptian Delegation now on its way to this country.The political and strategical questions involved in the Milner proposals are of such outstanding interest that they may tend to overshadow the effect of the proposals on Army Funds, while the invariable difficulty and delicacy of any financial negotiations with the Egyptian Government may operate in the direction of allowing these financial issues to go by default.The following note shows the financial importance of the questions involved, and their bearing on the future strength of the Army.L. W.-E.The War Office,5th July, 1921.I. Egypt&apos;s Annual Military Contribution to Army Funds.In principle this contribution has represented the extra cost of maintaining troops in Egypt as compared with home. Since 1907 it has been fixed at 150,000/. a year. The inadequacy of this contribution compared with the enormously increased cost of the garrison at the present day was pointed out in the Cabinet Paper mentioned above, but in die Milner proposals the abandonment of even this small contribution appears to be involved, as Great Britain is to have the &quot; right to maintain a military force on Egyptian soil for the protection of her Imperial communications &quot; (not for- garrison purposes).The total amount provided in Army Estimates, 1921-22, for the garrison of Egypt is 5,944,100/., excluding non-effective charges. This total includes abnormal charges, and the annual cost of the British garrison on the 9-battalion basis contemplated for the immediate future may be put, roughly, at 4,000,000/. The same British units, if maintained at home, are estimated to cost, approximately, 2,500,000/. a year. In other words, if Egypt pays towards the British garrison only on the basis of extra cost, as in the past, she should pay for the present at the rate of something like 1,500,000/. a year, instead of the existing 150,000/., while if she were to pay, as India does, the whole cost of the troops within her borders, she would pay at least 4,000,000/. a year, in addition to non-effective and home training charges. These figures are, of course, only a first approximation, and they are subject to future changes in the size of the garrison, but they show that the British tax-payer is now bearing nine-tenths of the extra cost due to the presence in Egypt of the troops there stationed, and all but a small fraction of their whole cost, which, under present financial conditions, will have to be found by striking other troops off the Army altogether.II. Military Charges for the Civil Disturbance of 1919.No definite claim against the Egyptian Government has yet been formulated in respect of the extra expenditure arising out of the retention in Egypt, owing to riots in the Spring of 1919, of British, Australian and New Zealand troops. The extra expenditure out of Army Funds due to these riots and to the continued unsettled state of Egypt has amounted to many millions. The Treasury have refunded to Australia, and propose to refund to New Zealand, the expenses thrown upon them on this account, amounting together to 635,000/., without prejudice to the question of recovering this sum from the Egyptian Government.It was pointed out in paragraph 10 of the Cabinet Paper mentioned above, that the principle adopted in the past has been that, while extra military expenditure
incurred on Imperial objects, such its the relief of Gordon, was wholly British, that incurred for the security of Egypt against raids by Dervishes, &amp;c, should be paid by Egypt, in addition to the normal annual contribution ; and this latter principle would seem to apply a fortiori to the cost of quelling civil disturbances.III. Futuee Garrison of the Sudan.In Section III. (D) of their Report, dealing with the Sudan, the Milner Mission remark : &quot; The military forces still employed in the Sudan are very large ... In our opinion, the question of the number and organization of its military forces should be reconsidered, and the financial burden upon Egypt which the maintenance of that force involves be reduced ... In general, it should be the aim of British policy to relieve Egypt from any financial responsibility for the Sudan.&quot;If this means that the Egyptian Army, of which the garrison of the Sudan is at present mainly composed, is to be withdrawn, or that in any other way Egypt is to cease to be liable for the greater part of the Sudan garrison, a large extra charge would be thrown upon the Imperial Exchequer, since it seems unlikely that the Sudan revenues will contribute anything. The cost of the present Egyptian garrison is understood to be about 1,250,000/. a year (in addition to about 200,000/. for the British contingent, included in the figures under I. above), and a force equal to the present garrison is, according to Lord Allenby, the minimum which should be maintained.It is understood from semi-official communications that the Foreign Office do not contemplate that Egypt will give up, or will wish to give up, her share in the duty of garrisoning the Sudan, nor that any change will be made in the existing division of the cost. If this view be maintained, it will be well to guard against any misunderstanding of the terms of the Milner report, the above quotation from which certainly seems to suggest a different view.IV. Egypt&apos;s Contribution to the Charges of the Great War.It was shown under Section A of CP. 1536, that a large part of the  E3,000,000 charged to Suspense, which was accepted by Egypt, could not be regarded as a real relief to the Imperial Exchequer. It has never been clear that Egypt regarded the railway and other material represented by the amounts in the Suspense Account as being now the property of the Imperial Government, and it is now reported that, owing to a general instruction issued by the Egyptian Ministry of Finance, inconsistent with the offer made by the Egyptian Government in regard to the Suspense Account, the Egyptian Government departments are claiming to recover from Army Funds the value of the stores included in the suspense account in so far as they were issued for Army purposes. The War Office has sent instructions to the General Officer Commancling-in-Chief that such claims are not to be paid.V, Provision of Barracks for the British Garrison.Since 1884 Egypt has recognized a general obligation to provide barracks for British troops, and to re-provide a building, or at least a site for one, in place of any worn-out or destroyed. The obligation is rather vague and ill-defined, and it has not generally been taken to cover improvements or additions to the barracks provided for us; these we carry out at our own cost. But Egypt placed at our disposal the Kasr-el-Nil barracks, and, shortly before the war, at a time when it was proposed that we should give up those barracks for&apos; the use of Egyptian troops, she paid for the construction of the new Abbasiyeh barracks for our troops in lieu. That transaction has, as a matter of fact, left rather an unfortunate memory behind it, because when it came to the point, Lord Kitchener, who was by that time High Commissioner, would not agree, in the interests of civil order in Cairo, to have no British battalion nearer than Abbasiyeh, and we are now occupying both barracks.If the change in our relationship with Egypt is to involve the evacuation of (or payment for) barracks at present in our possession, heavy charges for the provision of barracks will have to be incurred by the British Government.The question of Egypt&apos;s liability for providing barracks for the British force in the future is perhaps of sufficient importance to require definition in the Instrument resulting from the negotiations.VI.-Financial Concessions as Regards Railways, Telegraphs, Customs, &amp;c.The question whether these should be dealt with in the negotiations depends on the degree of detail to be embodied in the resulting Instrument. It appears unlikely that we should ever obtain any concession of value in separate and subsequent negotiations.
