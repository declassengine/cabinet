[This Document is the. Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government j,printed for the Cabinet.  July 1921.SECRET.CP.-3151.CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE STATE OF IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 18th instant.General State of the Country.I am glad to state that the truce, which has now been in operation for more than a week, has been scrupulously observed, both in the letter and in the spirit, by both sides. The instantaneous cessation of outrages throughout the length and breadth of the country at the time appointed for the truce to begin was undoubtedly a very remarkable feat of organisation on the part of the persons by whom they were controlled and directed, and, incidentally, furnishes striking evidence of the formidable nature of the conspiracy against the peace of the realm with which the Irish Executive have been contending during the past two years. On the part of the Crown Forces the most perfect discipline has been maintained. Notwithstanding the fact that the pressure of guerilla warfare and assassination was maintained against them with increased intensity until the last moment, not one single act of retaliation occurred, and if it was the intention of their enemies to provoke them into committing breaches of the truce with a view to discrediting them before the world the provocation only served to throw their demonstration of discipline into stronger relief. The much abused &quot; Black and Tans &quot; and Auxiliaries have given the lie in the most effectual manner to their critics, who will, perhaps, hesitate before again repeating the monstrous libel that these gallant men have made themselves the masters of the Government they profess to serve.Disturbances in Belfast.The outbreak of party disturbances in Belfast, to which reference was made in my last week&apos;s report, continued intermittently from the 10th until the 16th instant. The annual Orange demonstrations on the 12th instant passed off without any serious incident, but earlier in the day attacks were made on a number of Roman Catholic homes and several spirit groceries were looted. Rioting between the opposing crowds took place on the following days and several persons were killed or injured by stone-throwing and revolver-firing. The total casualties for the seven days&apos; rioting were 20 persons killed and 108 wounded, among the number wounded being Mr. W. Grant, a member of the Northern Parliament. Over 100 houses were wholly or partially destroyed, and a considerable quantity of furniture was burned. Owing to the strenuous exertions of the Police, supported by the Military, order was restored by the evening of the 16th instant, and although the City still remains in a dangerously excited condition, no further outbreak of disturbances has since occurred.Trials of Civilians by Court-Martial.The results of 46 trials by Court Martial were promulgated during the week, showing 43 convictions and 3 acquittals. The following ;s an analysis of the sentences imposed: [6653]
29 sentences of penal servitude (3 years to 20 years). 8 sentences of imprisonment with hard labour (90 days to 2 years). 6 fines (5/. to 50/.).Total  43Sentence of 20 years&apos; penal servitude was imposed in two cases for complicity in an attack on BaJlaghaderesa K.I.C. bari;ack on the 17th May last, and sentences ranging from 3 years to 15 years&apos; penal servitude for the possession of arms and seditious literature. Fines of 10/. each were imposed on two Constables of the Royal Irish Constabulary for the offence of assaulting a sergeant.Internment Orders.The following table shows the position as regards internments up to the 16th instant: Orders madeOrders cancelled for reasons other than release 131 Releases ordered ...         ...        ...       3553,795 486Number of persons now interned ...        ...         ...     - 3,309The number of appeals at, present awaiting hearing is 39.State of the Police Forces.iThe following figures show the present position of the Irish Police Forces.

Under the healing influence of the truce conditions of life throughout Southern Ireland are rapidly resuming their normal aspect, and the desire for a settlement which will secure to them the restored amenities of social existence by some less precarious tenure than that of a truce is everywhere manifest among all classes. A resumption of hostilities is declared on all sides to be unthinkable, and it is on this firm opinion that the universal optimism in the outcome of the negotiations appears to be founded. A notable feature of the situation is the entire absence of speculation as to the precise terms on which the settlement is to be brought about. Mr. de Valera&apos;s vaguely worded claim for the recognition of Ireland&apos;s right of self-determination is generaly regarded as a tacit, renunciation of the Republican principle for which Sinn Fein has of late years professed to stand, and it is significant that at no time since the present peace discussions commenced has the ideal of an Irish Republic received support in any section of the daily press or in the form of public demonstration.In Ulster Mr. de Valera&apos;s pronouncement was widely, although probably erroneously, interpreted as an attack upon the liberties of the Northern Parliament, and Sir James Craig&apos;s timely declaration that the principle of self-determination applies with equal force to the Six Counties Area received emphatic endorsement in the Unionist press of Belfast. It is gratifying to observe, however, that the Northern Premiers expression of satisfaction with the progress of the efforts that are being made for peace was equally welcomed by his supporters, as was also his promise of cordial co-operation with Southern Ireland in any matters affecting the interests of the whole countrv.H.
