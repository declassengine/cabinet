(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OJF HIS BRITAMIC MAJESTYTS GOVERNMENT) SECRETCABINETC.P.3167&quot;SHORT TIME&quot; inH.M. DOCK YARDS AND INDUSTRIAL ESTABLISHMENTS. Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty;It will be remembered that last winter the Cabinet decided (Cabinet 77(30) Minute 4), to introduce &quot;short time&quot; working into the Government Establishments for the purpose of alleviating unemployment.   &quot;Short Time&quot; working was accordingly commenced in H.M.Dockyards, and other Admiralty Industrial Establishments at Home, on 23rd January, 1921,The method of &quot;short time&quot; adopted in the Admiralty Establishments was generally to reduce the working hours in the week from the normal 47 hours to 40 hours by closing the Bstab-lishments altogether on Saturdayand by a slight reduction in the number of working hours on other days.By the adoption of &quot;short time&quot;, it was possible to engage about 7,500 men for temporary employment during the first three months of 1921.   Most of the work on which these casual entrants could economically be employed has now oome to an end, the number still retained being about 2,700.The effect has been to retard the discharges which were necessary to bring the numbers of employees down to the level of normal requirements.   The fact, however, that numbers remain inflated in relation to normal requirements, is being used constantly, in Parliament and the Country, to support oharges of wasteful expenditure brought against the Government.&quot;Short time&quot;, moreover, is prejudicial to the efficient and economical administration of the Establishments, for the following reasons(a) -
(a) The time required to carry out eaoh piece of work is necessarily considerably extended, and the periods of ineffeetIreness of ships are unduly prolonged,(b) Labour, Machinery, and applianoes are used to less advantage,(o) A general slackening and lowering of tone is engendered.Further, in the discussions that have taken place as to the application to the Dockyards of reductions in wages whioh have been agreed to by the Shipbuilding and Engineering Trades generally, the Trade Unions have made it dear that their policy is to treat the shorter hours as &quot;stabilised&quot;, and to argue that the lower weekly inoome due to the shorter hours must be taken into consideration when any further reductions in wages are made. Should this view be accepted, it would have the effect of retaining wages in relation to output at an unduly high figure.Taking all these considerations into account, it is most important to move in the direotion of normal working hours and conditions as quickly as oircumstances admit;   and it is proposed to do this by increasing the &quot;short time&quot; working hours from 40 to 42 per week during the precdmt month (say, on and from 14th August) with a view to reverting to full time (47 hours a week) later in the finanoial year.   Unless therefore, any objection is raised by the Cabinet, it is proposed to issue orders accordingly by the 5th proximo.   The mens1 representatives have already indicated their aoquiescenoe, and, in this connection I would draw attention also to the attached Answer whioh was given in the House of Commons on the 20th instant,I may add that these proposals will not involve any increase in the expenditure on wages already provided for in the JJavy Estimates for the current financial year,(Intd.)      of F.26th July. 1921,
PARLIA3TOARY DEBATES - 30th July 1921 Industrial Employees (Short Time)20o H.T.BRAMSDON asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty whether, in view of the fact that the Admiralty had put into operation the findings of the Industrial Arbitration Board as regards the reduction of the 6/- bonus awarded in April and June, 1920, to the industrial employes of the naval establishments, he will state if an immediate revision from the short time now being worked to the full working week will take place;   and, if not, will he say at what future date the normal hours of working will be put into operation^Commander BIEBS-MDWSELl:   The question of reverting to full working hours in the Royal Dockyards and other Admiralty establishments has been, and now is, under consideration.   I may inform the hon0Member that a resolution on the subject was adopted by the Admiralty Industrial Council, of which I am Chairman, on Friday last, in which the representatives of the employes1 side, as wen as of the Department, expressed the opinion that full time should be resumed at the earliest possible date, but that this should be done in stages, with-an increase from 40 to 42 hours a week in the first instance. It is anticipated it will be possible to make a further announcement on the subject in the near future
