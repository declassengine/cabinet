(THIS DPCUMBHT IS TH.8 EBOEBHTE OF HIS BRITAIINIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOYgRNMT)cdCABINETrfpcrt PY the general OFFICER COMMANDING-IK-CHIEF ON ibb situation ib iceland FOR wejsk ENDING2nd July, 1921. egret,^tp,5t09, ........................-(Circulated &quot;by the Secretary of State for War).ggepjx.....jo-i Ijgy SI TUATDff *The past week has been ccmparatively quiet a3 far as the troops are concerned.   In Dublin a search of some disused brack-works re sal tod in the capture of six revolvers,- seme shot guns and a certain amount of ammunition.   In the country the principal occurrences hare been the capture of 46 rebels attending a &quot;battalion&quot; meeting at Waterfall,&apos; Co..Cork;   the capture of four rebels and several rifles by a party of the l/fioyal Fusiliers at Beaufort, Co.Kerry; and the stirprlse of a rebel ambush by a patrol of Auxiliary RIG., 2 rebels being killed and 4 wounded and 11 rifles ana shot guns captured,,,    At Stacutnmy, Co.Kildare an attempt, to wreck a troop train was frustrated by a military patrol which came upon r,efrels laying mines on the &quot;line.   Four rebels are believed to have been wounded.   Six mines were removed and the train reached its destination unharmed.   There have also been a number of murders of police.The attention of the Press ana Public has been concentrated on the invitation,of the Prime Minister to Sir James Craig and Mr. De Valors, and to the subsequent developments.   Sir James Craig as was &apos;to be expected, has accepted the invitation, but whether the leader of the rebel party in Southern Ireland will do so or not, remains to be seen.   Several indications point to the conclusion that there has been but little change in the attitude of Sinn Fein and that they are not yet prepared to abandon their claim to a republic    De Valera in his invitation to Sir James Craig and four Southern Unionists to meet hint at a preliminary conference in Dublin on 4th July,refers to himself as the spokesman for all Ireland - this deliberately ignoring the existence of the Northern Parliament which was opened by His Majesty on June 82nd.   The proclamation published in the Irish Press on. Saturday evening (2nd July) directing that the American Flag is to be flown throughout Ireland on Independence Day in honour of the principle for whioh the rebels are fighM*g;, is another indication that the   dream of a Republic dies hard in the mind of the wouia-be President.   Such an attitude can only tend to make Conference and settlement more difficult.*
The Irish Government has during tho last few days released a number of rebel leaders from Mountjoy Prisonpresumably with the objects of proving their honesty of purpose, and of showing Sinn Pein and the world that every facility will be given to De Valera to meet ana consult his colleagues.   Of the four seleoted for release Mr. Arthur Griffith is the only one who is not or has not been directly involved in the I.K.A.   Professor McNeill was Chief of the Staff during the 1916 Rebellion and having failed, he lost favour aiiong the extremists, and consequently lost his appointment as well.   Michael Staines and E.T.Duggan are both important members of the I,R.A. &quot;Headquarters - the latter at the time of his arrest was director of Intelligence, while the last appointment of M.Stainesf who at one time&apos; acted for Michael Collins, was believed to have been Director of .&apos; Organization. , Robert Barton, who has been released from Portland Gaol, in addition to being &quot;Minister of Agriculture&quot; of the Dail Eireann, held the appointment . of Commandant in the Wicklow Brigade.  he was once a claims Offioer at GHQ. but his record as snob does not lead one to the belief tfcat he has claims to any Military efficiency.Although all these individuals are extremists,the$ are men of some education, and may during their &apos; * imprisonment have developed the sense to see.that their claim to a republic will never be   granted. here is no doubt that-the Prime Minister^ offer has raised a gleam of hope throughout the:-country,, and pressure will undoubtedly be brought, to bear both by the Press and the Church on the Sinn Pein leaders td induoe them to attend the Conference.   Vfhether the results of the meeting will be effective depends more than anything else on whether the I.R.A. realise that they are bound to be beaten, and that nothing will ever induce the British nation to allow them to secedoV There has been no sign of this in captured correspondence or in the &quot;official communiques&quot; and Journals of the . republican leaders.   On the contrary, every attempt  * at conciliation and settlement has hitherto been interpreted by them as a sign of impending victory. The recent losses of the I.R.A.,. the arrival of reinforcements, the fear of.-universal Martial Law, the knowledge that the present attempt at settlement is a final one, ,the sympathetic reception of Mr.Lloyd Georgers offer not only in Great Britain and on tae* Continent, but more especially in Americaand Ireland, may possibly induoe the dreamers and agitators who are responsible for all the present trouble, to realise that they are asking for the impossible, and induoe them to accept, for a time at, an$ rate, some arrangement which would restore peace to a country which has nothing to gain by a continuance of the policy of outrage and murder.   On&apos; the surface the outlook is not hopeful - but there is just a chance that . the Sinn Pein leaders may at last see reason, and risk the displeasure of their more fanatical followers.j.
