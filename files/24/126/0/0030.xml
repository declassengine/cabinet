W.-E.The War Office,\Wh July, 1921.1. In the report by Captain Brunton, General Staff (Intelligence), Palestine, recently circulated to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP. 3030), the writer deals at some length with the political aspect of the recent riots at Jaffa, and gives a sketch of the circumstances which, during the past three years, have been steadily leading up to an outbreak. In paragraph 6 of his report he mentions the inadequacy of the present British garrison to enforce our present policy. The Secretary of State for the Colonies, in his covering note, mentions the probability of &quot; serious military embarrassments &quot; in which we may. become involved.2. On 6th June the General Officer Commanding, Egypt, forwarded to the War Office a copy of a Memorandum (C.R./Egypt/i7820 G.) which he had addressed to Sir H. Samuel on 30th May, pointing out to him the inadequacy of the British force in Palestine to carry out its triple role, viz., to maintain order in the larger towns, to repel raids from Trans-Jordania, and to protect outlying Jewish settlements in the event of a general risine; of Moslems throughout Palestine. The General Officer Commanding states that in spite of a speech which Sir H. Samuel made on 3rd June, by means of which the High Commissioner hoped to placate the Arabs, the situation envisaged in his Memorandum probably remains unaltered, and we must be prepared for outbreaks of violence during the next few months.3. The folio win o- factors affect the situation : O(a.) The Palestine Defence Force has been abandoned, and the Gendarmerie, which it is proposed to form in its stead, cannot be expected to mature for some considerable time.(6.) The. High Commissioner, with the assistance of the General Officer Com-manding, is taking steps to form a species of &quot;Town Guards &quot; in the Jewish villages and colonies by issuing arms to selected men.   It is, however, problematical how far such organizations will be capable of the defence of. their localities. -4. The British force in Palestine is, at present, necessarily distributed in detachments, in order to watch the Jordan frontier and to deal with disturbances in the larger towns. In the event, however, of anything of the nature of a general rising, such unsound military procedure cannot possibly be adhered to, and it will be absolutely essential to concentrate. This will involve the abandonment of many of the Jewish colonies and the leaving of the Jewish population to conduct their own defence, if possible, against the Moslems.The General Staff, therefore, are compelled to endorse the opinion of the General Officer Commanding as given in his Memorandum, that we are faced with three alternatives, i.e. (a.) An alteration of policy as regards Jewish immigration ;(b.) An increase in the British garrison; or(c.) The acceptance of serious danger to the Jewish population.. 8th July, 1921.(B31/259)   100  7/X1   II&amp;S, Ltd.   9IMlwo
