[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]&apos;Printed for ike Cabinet.   July 1921.SECRET.CP. 3177.CABINET.SUPERVISION   OF   GERMAN   MILITARY   ACTIVITIES   AFTER   THE DISSOLUTION OF THE INTER-ALLIED COMMISSIONS OF CONTROL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State eor Foreign Affairs.No. 1.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues certain correspondence (Annexes I to V) dealing with the method whereby any possible development of German military activity in the future may best be controlled and supervised by the Allied Governments after the dissolution of the Inter-Allied Military, Naval and Aeronautical Commissions of Control As this question will have to be considered by the Allied Governments at an early date, I should be glad to know that the course which I propose to recommend is approved by the Cabinet.2. The Inter-Allied Military, Naval and Aeronautical Commissions of Control were established under the Treaty of Versailles to supervise the execution of the military, naval and aeronautical clauses of the treaty. With the complete execution of these clauses the commissions must disappear. The only heir to their activities, fore-shadowed under the treaty, is an investigation which, in regard to any particular matter, may be conducted under the auspices of the Council of the League of Nations, in virtue of article 213 of the treaty.3. Given the present status of the League, such an investigation appears of doubtful value. It is most improbable that it will satisfy the French. Indeed there are already signs that the French, while opposing the immediate dissolution of the existing Commissions of Control, are seeking to transfer their functions to new organisations containing all their disadvantages. The new organisations which the French apparently have in mind would be in permanent session and consequently costly to Allied finance. In them, moreover, would be inherent all the occasions for friction between Germany and the Allies, which it has been the constant policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, as far as possible, to remove.4. The type of organisation for which I would ask the approval of the Cabinet is of a less ambitious nature. It is described in detail in the War Office and Air Ministry letters annexed (Annexes III and IV). It would consist of military, naval and aeronautical commissions, each comprising echelons of officers of those Allied nationalities now represented on the Inter-Allied Commissions of Control. These officers would normally be employed in their own capitals in their ordinary work., Only when the Allied Governments themselves, or some such Allied body as the Conference of Ambassadors in Paris, acting upon the advice of the Allied War Offices, or of some joint military body such as the Inter-Allied Military Committee of Versailles, received reports of suspicious German military, naval or aeronautical activity, would these military, naval or aeronautical commissions respectively be ordered to assemble, to investigate and to report. These commissions, unlike the Inter-Allied Commissions of Control, would have to be paid by the Allied Governments.5. This, in brief, is the proposal which I have in mind. It is not covered by the treaty, for it is in temporary substitution, at least, of the investigation by the Council of the League of Nations, contemplated under article 213. It is therefore necessary to obtain German consent before it can be put into execution. This consent can only be, obtained by the offer of some quid pro quo to the German Government.6. The quid pro quo which I would recommend would consist, in part at least, of an undertaking on the part of the Allied Governments to dissolve the existing commissions of control by fixed dates. This undertaking must be immediate, for the time for the dissolution of the existing naval and aeronautical commissions of control is, I believe, almost if not already overdue, and the drastic reduction of the military commission of control cannot be much longer delayed.7. I would therefore suggest that the Supreme Council should at its next meeting-be urged to adopt the proposal outlined above, notify it to the German Government, and offer to the German Government, in return for the acceptance of this proposal at [6550 dd-l] d   [6687] B
least, the reduction of the existing commissions of control to skeleton liquidating committees by certain fixed dates and, by further fixed dates, their complete dissolution.C. of K.Foreign Oftee, July 27, 1921.[C 13421/13/18] Annex I.Lord WAbernon to Earl Curzon. (Received June 30.)(No. 789.)My Lord, Berlin, June 8, 1921.NOW that the reparation question is settled it would seem that the most important and urgent question before European statesmanship is the control over military preparations in Germany after the disappearance of the Disarmament Commissions.Until recently article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles has been regarded as the sheet anchor.   It runs as follows : &quot;So long as the present treaty remains in force, Germany undertakes to give every facility for any investigation which the Council of. the League of Nations, !     acting if need be by a majority vote, may consider necessary.&quot;Whatever the validity of this clause, if the League of Nations had developed, as its friends expected, it is impossible to feel any great confidence in it, under present circumstances.&apos;I have at frequent intervals suggested that, at some favourable moment, negotia-tions might be entered^ upon with the German Government under which certain advantages might be granted them in the matter of reparation or in the matter of immediate disarmament if they agreed to the establishment of a reasonable form of international insurance against future war dangers. But these suggestions have not found much support; I am told that the Admiralty and War Office are absolutely opposed to anything of the nature of military control.Now I fully recognise that there are valid objections to a long continuance of the present Military Commission; its expense, the danger of friction, the inquisitorial nature of its functions, &amp;c, all render it unsuitable for prolonged existence. But is there no device or compromise which would give the security or insurance required and which would not encounter military objection ?I gather from a letter copy of which I enclose from Marshal Foch to Admiral Charlton of the 3rd September, 1920, that the subject of future control has been at different intervals under consideration by the Allied Military Committee of Versailles, but that owing to the alleged opposition on the part of the English naval and military advisers, no definite action has been taken. 1 am not sure that some misconception does not exist in France regarding the precise views of His Majesty&apos;s Government. As I understand it the Cabinet was, in the first instance, inclined to adopt a recommenda-tion that a Permanent Advisory Commission of the League of Nations should establish -a Commission of Investigation in Germany, which should include : (a.) A president from among the members of the Permanent Advisory Commission. \b.) The local attaches and such other members of the  Permanent advisory commission as the Council may direct, (c.) Additional technical members to be asked for when required by the council for such Governments as they might decide.This scheme was dropped, as both the Admiralty and the War Office felt strong objections to allowing naval and military attaches to be employed for this purpose, on the grounds that they would be regarded in Germany merely as spies of the League of Nations, and their good relations with the German naval and military authorities would be destroyed. The validity of this argument would appear somewhat doubtful, and, in so far as it may be true, is susceptible of being met by minor modifications.The latest available information goes to show that the French Government now think that the Allied Governments individually would have at their disposal means of learning whether any serious infraction of the military clauses of the treaty had occurred, and, if such infraction did occur, would be able to bring it to the notice of the League of Nations. But the present status of the League of Nations, however, does not seem to afford grounds tor anticipating that such action would be particularly
Enclosure 1. Marshal Foch to Admiral Gharlton.Paris, September 3, 1920.BY a letter dated the 10th August, 1920, of which a copy is attached, the President of the Council has asked the Military Allied Committee at Versailles if it would not be to their interest to invite the Commissions of Control to put forward before their dissolution the proposals as to the manner in which the Council oi&apos; the League of Nations should eventually exercise in the ex-enemy countries the right of control which is granted to it by the peace treaties.The Military Allied Committee of Versailles has given on this question the opinion set forth in the attached copy. This opinion was, approved by the Conference of Ambassadors on the 31st August.In consequence, I have the honour to ask you if you would kindly let me know immediately, prior to the dissolution of the commission over which you preside, your proposals in so far as they concern-   ,1. The measures which it is agreed should be taken, after the dissolution of the Naval Commission of Control, to continue to exercise supervision in Germany in order to be assured that this power conforms well to the naval clauses set forward in the Treaty of Versailles.2. The liaison to be established by your commission before its dissolution with the Council of the League of Nations to grant it the permission to exercise in its turn the control hitherto exercised by the Naval Commission.(For the General of Division),Chief of Staff DESTICKEB,Enclosure 2.Question. Uncertain Work of the Right of Enquiry laid down to the League ofNations by the Peace Treaty.(Copy of Letter No. 5, dated the 10th August, of M. the President-of the Council, Minister for Foreign Affairs (French Service of the League of Nations).)THE treaties signed by the Allied and Associated. Powers on the one part, and Germany, Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria respectively on the other part,Article 213 of the Versailles Treaty, Article 159 of the Saint-Germain Treaty, Article 143 of the Trianon Treaty, Article 104 of the Treaty of Neuilly,effective. Any weight the representations of the League of Nations might have would he seriously diminished if it had to act on casual information obtained in. -a manner different from that laid down in the Treaty.Is it not probable that action by an international body with an impartial and non-national status would have greater authority in Germany and would arouse less resentment than action through the naval and military attaches of one of the Allied Governments. My strong preference, therefore, is for action by an international, as opposed to a national, body.The whole matter is of such vast importance that I trust it will be fully considered by His Majesty&apos;s advisers before it is too late. There is not much time. The Commissions of Disarmament have made such rapid progress with their work that their numbers will be largely diminished in the immediate future, and they themselves can hardly survive beyond the close of the present year. It is certain that any negotiations with the German Government will have a better chance of success if taken while the Commissions are in existence. Once they disappear I see little hope of any favourable : solution.The object of the present despatch is not to advocate any particular scheme. It is rather to draw attention to the lateness of the hour, and to suggest that the whole subject should be re-examined at once both in London and Paris, in the fullest and most Hinprejudicial manner.I have, &amp;c.D&apos;ABERNON.
have permitted to the League of Nations the right to exercise in the former enemy States all enquiries that it judges necessary.The C.M.A.V. is asked under which form it will be best to proceed if the Council of the League of Nations decided to exercise this right.The C.M.A.V. have decided unanimously that the Commissions of Control (representing the Government of the Allied Powers in the ex-enemy countries) should be asked to formulate proposals concerning 1. Measures which it is thought wise to take in order to provide after the dissolution of the Commissions of Control, that a supervision is exercised in the ex-enemy countries in order to ensure that they conform well to the military, naval and aeronautical clauses set forth in the peace treaty.2. The liaisons that the Commissions of Control at the time of their dissolution ought to establish with the Council of the League of Nations to allow it when it sees fit, to exercise in its turn the control exercised up to now by the commissions.Enclosure 3.The Ministry for Foreign Affairs to Marshal Foch.Paris, August 10, 1920.I HAVE the honour to put before you the attached copy of the report set forward by General Fayolle after the first meeting of the Consulting Commission of the League of Nations on the naval, military and aeronautical questions.I shall be glad if you will kindly let me know your opinion on the questions set forward by General Fayolle, in particular on the help that the Consulting Commission should be called upon to give to the League, in case it should decide in the future to proceed, conforming to its right recognised in the peace treaty, to an investigation in the former enemy States.In this order of events, it seems that the Inter-Allied Commissions of Control, taught by long experience, should be asked to draw up before they dissolve, some pro-posals aud methods of enquiry to be used eventually. Such proposals would be very useful to the Consulting Commission of the League of Nations when called upon to give advice on the methods to adopt, dependent on the nature and the object of all enquiries decided by the Council.In any case we have a share in the question put forward by the French Military, Aeronautical and Naval delegation at Saint-Sebastien, to see that a decision is arrived at on the matter which does not leave any doubt in the minds of the non-belligerent States becoming members of the League, on the duty which is imposed upon it to exercise its right of enquiry in the former enemy States each time that proofs are clearly established.I shall be much obliged, therefore, if you will let; me have all the suggestions on this subject that you consider useful.(Attached is only an extract of the said report.)Enclosure 4.Extract from a Report of the Consulting Commission of the League of Nations on theMilitary, Naval and Aeronautical Questions.Questions put forward at a Meeting at Saint-Sebastien on the 3rd, Uh and 5th August, 1920.4. The possible Exercise of Right of Enquiry admitted by the Peace Treaties to the League.THE French delegation has raised this question calling attention to the fact that it was brought forward by the report of M.

It was remarked on this subject that if the protocol of Spa was carried out by Germany, the responsibility of the League could be engaged
[C 12327/13/18] Annex II.Lord IV Abevnon to Earl Curzon. (Received June 14.)(NO.   817:)My Lord, Berlin, June 10, 1921.WITH reference to my despatch No. 789 of the 8th June, 1921, dealing with the possibility of control over German military preparations after the disappearance of the Disarmament Commission, I now have the honour to forward a memorandum drawn up by a writer who has special means of knowing the probable attitude of German political parties.I have, &amp;c.D&apos;ABERNON.Enclosure.Memorandum.IN view of the importance of the question of some form of permanent control over military preparations in Germany, the probable attitude of the German political parties to this question arises.During the political struggles of the past two years, the Socialist parties have carried on a violent and unceasing propaganda in favour of disarmament, and have attempted, by revelations in the press, the use of an extensive espionage system and other methods, to assist the Disarmament Commission. Socialist leaders have frequently expressed, in personal interviews, their satisfaction at the existence of the Disarmament Commission, and regret that their powers were not even greater.The intense fear of future military action by the reactionary parties was especially noticeable at the time of the Kapp revolution, and, although great progress in disarmament has since been made, hatred and suspicion of the future intentions of the Right parties has not diminished to any great extent. The experience of the past two years seems to show that the existence of Allied representatives in various parts of Germany does not decrease, but rather tends to increase, the influence of the Left parties.It is therefore most probable that the Left parties, up to and including the Majority Socialists, would not oppose some form of permanent control in Germany.The attitude of the Zentrum and Social Democratic parties is more doubtful, but here again the fear that the withdrawal of all Entente control would lead to increased reactionary activity might induce the majority to accept some form of control as the lesser of two evils.The Nationalist parties and the Volkspartei would probably oppose the idea.[6550 dd-l]Cfrom the 1st January, 1921.   The Commission has unanimously passed the following resolution : &quot;The Commission having been impressed by the resolutions of the Council of the League at Rome, with the necessity for organising in advance the method of exercising (in the case of necessity) the right of enquiry allowed to the League by the peace treaties, decides that the consideration of this organisation shall figure at the end of the questions already entered in the agenda of the next meeting.&quot;In consequence, and in anticipation of the next meeting of the commission, I havethe honour to ask if you will kindly let me have your opinion........(4) on theway in which one ought to proceed if the Council of the League should decide in the future on an enquiry in the old enemy countries.
(jAnnex III.War Office to Foreign Office.(Secret.)Sir, War Office, July 13, 1921.IN reply to Foreign Office letter dated the 6th July, 1921, relative to the control of the German army and of military preparations in Germany after the dissolution of the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control now at work in Germany, I am commanded to say that the views of the Army Council are as follows : 1. Some form of military control is necessary, and will probably have to continue for a number of years. Such control must be effective, but as inconspicuous and unostentatious as possible.2. No definite period is fixed for the termination of control in Germany under the Treaty of Versailles, but the Germans have always assumed that it would be removed as soon as the military terms have been fully complied with.3. On the 29th January, 1921, the Supreme Council came to the decision, with reference to aerial matters, &quot; that the Allied Governments shall assure themselves by constant supervision that Germany is fulfilling her obligations,&quot; Le., that Germany shall accept the definitions established by the Allied Powers to distinguish civil aviation from military aviation, forbidden by article 198.It is not known how it is proposed to carry out this constant supervision.4. From this decision it appears that the Supreme Council consider that the Allied Governments are entitled under the Treaty of Versailles to carry out &quot; constant supervision,&quot; i.e., to continue supervision for a number (apparently indefinite) of years.5. Article 213 of the treaty shows that the Allies originally, i.e , in 1919, intended control and investigation (subsequent to the completion of the duties of the present Inter-Allied Commissions of Control now at work in Germany) to be carried out by the League of Nations.It is now doubtful whether the authority of the League can be regarded as adequate, and in any case it is desirable that the work of control and investigation be carried out by Allied officers.6. In view of these considerations, it is recommended that the Allied Governments should come to an agreement with the German Government &quot;to induce the League of Nations to depute the investigation permitted under article 213 to a commission of Allied officers. No doubt a quid pro quo would have to be given to Germany in return for this concession.This commission would, of course, not Come into existence until the present Commission of Control has completed its duties in Germany. It should be a small body, composed of a total of some twenty to thirty members, including technical experts. In suggesting a composition for this commission, the Army Council desire me to say that they adhere to their opinion already expressed in earlier letters on this subject that British naval, military and air attaches should be expressly excluded.There is no need for the commission to sit permanently in Germany, and it is considered preferable for it either to be located in Paris, in close touch with the Allied Military Committee of Versailles, or, better still, for its members to remain in their own countries, employed on their ordinary work, until required to carry out any duties of investigation in Germany, which, it is hoped, will very rarely be necessary.7. It is presumed (an opinion shared by Marshal bbch) that the Allied Governments, individually, will have at their disposal means of learning of any serious infraction of the military clauses. of the treaty. Such infractions would at once be brought to the notice of the commission, with a view to the institution of an enquiry.8. It will be necessary for the German Government to bind itself to permit and to give every facility for immediate investigation by the commission, as soon as investigation has been decided upon.9. It remains to settle and this is a matter for the Allied Governments who should be empowered to order the investimation. The machinery for this must be simple and rapid.It is recommended that the power to order an investigation, on application by one or more of the Allied Powers, should, be vested in the Council of Ambassadors in Paris, on the recommendation of an Allied Military Committee such as that now functioning in Paris, under the presidency of Marshal Foch.I am, &amp;c.B. B. CUBITT.
Annex IV. Air Ministry to Foreign Office,Sir, Air Ministry, July 14, .1921.I AM commanded by the Air Council to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Tufton&apos;s letter of the 7th instant, enclosing copies of two recent despatches from Lord D&apos;Abernon, relative to the question of the future supervision of military preparations in Germany, and in reply to convey to you the following observations thereon for the consideration of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.2. The Council agree with the view expressed by Lord D&apos;Abernon as regards the disadvantages, in the actual position of the League of Nations, of placing too much stress on the possibilities of article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles being of sufficient efficacy to ,secure the observation of any steps by the German Government in the direction of rearmament. Whatever may be the future value of thnt article, it is clear that at present any Power (such as France or ourselves), which has a strong interest in keeping itself fully and early informed of any attempts on the part of Germany towards rearmament, beyond what is allowed under the Peace Treaty, will require to provide itself with its own machinery for such supervision as is necessary.3. On the question, however, of the method by which the necessary supervision can be obtained, the Air Council adhere to the opinion which they have previously expressed, and which was reiterated in their letter to the Foreign Office on the 20th ultimo. Their view, in brief, is that a standing Commission of Control as proposed by the French will be a constant source of friction with Germany, and would be no more likely to achieve its purpose than would the reliance on the ordinary sources of intelligence which the Air Council propose. It appears, however, to the Air Council that the German Government, having intimated their intention to accept the distinguishing rules, can reasonably be asked as evidence of the good faith of that -acceptance to offer facilities for full investigation in Germany by officers of the Allied countries appointed for the particular occasion in the event of any case of infringement of the distinguishing rules being alleged.4. The Air Council take note of the suggestion contained in the memorandum enclosed with Lord D&apos;Abernon&apos;s despatch No. 817, that the parties of the Left would not oppose some form of permanent control in Germany, in view of the attitude which they have adopted to the existing Disarmament Commissions. On this point the Air Council venture to suggest that such acquiescence as may have been enjoyed by the present Disarmament Commissions is not likely to extend beyond the time when the surrender of war stocks has been completed. The existence of these stocks, as the Air Council understand the position, has been regarded by the parties of the Left as adding to the possibilities of a militarist counter-revolution. When, however, disarmament is completed, any advantages in the way of insurance against rearmament, which from the point of viewr of the parties of the Left might be afforded by the existence of permanent Commissions of Control in Germany, would not outweigh the irritation in the country generally, and the occasion for unfortunate incidents which would be created.I am, &amp;c.W. F. NICHOLSON.Annex V.Admiralty to Foreign Office. Sir, Admiralty, July 19, 1921.WITH reference to your letter of the 6th July, regarding the future of control over military preparations in Germany, I am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaint you, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that they have always understood that the intention of article 213 of the Treaty of Peace was to give the League of Nations an opportunity of investigating suspicious cases and not of establishing a permanent and irksome system of control in -Germany.2. The Commissions of Control instituted under the Peace Treaty cease to function when a certain state of disarmament has been reached by Germany. After this date the Allied Powers must, in the opinion of their Lordships, rely upon their own watchfulness to prevent a breach of the disarmament clauses. In this connection it is extremely undesirable to use attaches for espionage work.
s3. As far as the navy is concerned, it would not be long before the Admiralty beard from one source or another of the construction of a battleship or a submarine. When such news was received, the organisation already devised under article 213 would be brought into play, (See Cabinet Minutes 62 (20) of the 18th November, 1920.)4. It is recognised that military investigation is a more difficult question, but it is thought that the French can be relied upon to prevent any dangerous progress being made. Once a breach of faith is established, the League of Nations can be invited to act; but it is unfair to the League, and contrary to the aims of the League, to put them in the position of permanent guardians of Germany&apos;s good faith in direct succession to the Commissions of Control, whose functions, moreover, has been the enforcement of measures against Germany.I am, &amp;c.ALEXANDER FLINT.
