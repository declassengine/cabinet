THB OOAI MINERSThe annual conference of the South Wales Miners Federation was held at Cardiff on July 23rd and 24th, Enoch Worrell presiding.   The delegates present numberod 216, representing 152,825 members.Morroll spoke on the general situation and on the difficulties that had arisen after the resumption of work.   He attributed some of these to the misunderstanding as to the proper interpretation to be put upon the terms of the national settlement, but added that there were other oases where wilful attempts had been made by colliery managers to take an unfair advantage of the present position to try to enforce new conditions.   The necessary steps had been taken by the Council to get these matters dealt with and to set up a district board for joint consideration of the disputes which had arisen.It was agreed that the 1915 Conciliation Board agreement should be renewed subject to the variations necessitated by the national settlement.   Morrell said that the workmen were very much incensed at some of the alterations that were being attempted to vary the conditions of employment and rates of wages which were entirely unauthorised by the national agreement. Resolutions were passed favouring amendments of the Coal Mines let so as to ensure more freedom for ohsckwsighers and that firemen be paid direct from the government.   IVwas also demanded that the supply of coal 3hould be either free or at privileged rates to widows of deceased workmen, injured workmen, etc the conference re-elected the following representatives for the national Executive, Messrs. J. WinstbnOj !U. Richards, Noah Ablott and A.J. Cook.It was resolved that a recommendation be made tothe/
mt     2the lodges that all workmen at present in employment ahonil be asked to contribute a levy of 5$ on their earnings for the relief of those out of work, and that they agree to thi moneys being retained at the colliery offices.A resolution was adopted expressing the view that in the opinion of South v.&apos;&amp;Ies the position of president of thqj Miners1 Federation of Great Britain should be ,Tan annual part time appointment.&quot;A resolution was proposed on behalf of the Ton Philip Lodge, Garw District, by its conference delegate &quot;That the Miners1 Federation of Great Britain at the annual conference of that body bo urged to affiliate and actively identify itself with the Third International(The secretary of thia Lodge is Hie fear d Be^netta, an extremist who was runner-up to Ted Williams in the ballot for the appointment of G&amp;rw District miners1 agent when the position was vacated by Fra.:fe Hodges.   Bonnotta has conducted propaganda at different times on behalf of the. National Union of Railwaymen and othor extremist organisations and he is anxious to oust Ted Williams from his position.)    The resolution was carried by 1:80 to 63.The decision of the ilieeutive of the Miners1 Poderatio of Great Britain to adopt the Coal Miners1 Act of 1920 has provoked the South Wales extremists to greater activity, especially in the Abertillery district, where the communists w&amp;e led by Hewlett, -just reverted to have been killed in to;The   &quot;moderate&quot; section of the workmen at the Nine Mile Point collieries met during the week and passed a resolution withdrawing any farther support to the Central Labour College.   The steadier members of the Tredegar Combine Lodge have agreed upon a similar policy.The extremist group which controls the affairs of the Hine Mile Point workmen is particularly active.   Jack Fisher, of Wattsvllle, the ex-Labour College student, is menacing looal industrial peace.   This man, as chiefspokesman/
spakesmn-of the local extremist group, le urging lessened.production as the only method to bring about absorptionin Ihoof tho unemployed/ captaine.   The group is out to wreck co-operation between coal-owners and workmen, and much industrial trouble is probable in this lower end of the Tradegar South Wales Miners&apos; Federation district&apos;as the result of Pi3her1s agitation.There is little change in the situation in the coalfields:   dissatisfaction with the terms and abuse of the Government and the owners are still much in evidence and the unofficial movement is gaining strength in somo districts;   A.V. Williams reports that he lias formed eighteen new workers1 committees in Lancashire.On June 25th,at Wigan Police Court, H. Twist, J.P., miners1 agent, R. Nixon, J.T. liars hall and T. Marsham were committed for trial at the next Liverpool Assizes,&apos; bail being allowed:   they are charged with obstructing or filling up the shaft of a mine which had been sunk 21 ft. to old workings in Dean Wood, Gathurst, by permission of the landowners.   The case is a sequel to demonstrations against the working of outcrops during the strike.Durham miners are complaining because their Executive is asking them to pay back the sum of  1 which full members received during the strike;   the Durham Miners1 Association borrowed  100,000 from the Co-operative Wholesale Society Bank in order, to pay out this money. The various Boards of Guardians are also asking the assistance of officials to, obtain the payment of money lent to relieve cases of distress:   many of the miners declare that they will not repay the money ard the ordinary ratepayers are opposed to any attempt to raise-the money by means of a special relief rate.THE CjggCTISTSFollowing a deputation to the Home Secretary on July22nd/
22nd a &quot;Proe Speech&quot; meeting was held in Trafalgar Square onl July 24th.   The speakers included Neil. MaoLoan, M,P., It. Commander Kenworthy, LLP,, Geor^o Lanabury, Arthur MoManus and Margaret Bondfiold,   The attendance waa about 1,000; very little enthusiasm was shown and only about  5 was thrown on the plinth.   The following resolution waa passed:-that this mass meeting of London citizens held under tho auspices of the Free Speech Defence Committee registers its emphatic protest against the Governments present policy of suppression and coercion; it demands the repeal of all emergency powers and considers that the Common Law of the land pi*ovidoa all thai; is required to uphold law and order; it asserts the right of every person to free and full expression of opinion on all matters of general and public interest, and calls upon the Government to grant a general amnesty to all persons imprisoned during the recent industrial dispute,The speeches contained little new matter, the main theme being an attack upon the &quot;tyranny11 of the Government and a repetition of Lord Carson&apos;s speeches.Neil J&amp;cLean voiced the disappointment with the meetingfelt by the extremists when he said;&quot;We call&apos; this a demonstration demanding the right of free speech, and we cannot fill Trafalgar Square. Why?   Because the Londoners have allow a! themselves to be doped by the northcliffe press, and t    oitoar Coalition papers.   When are the $cr&amp;lng classes of this country going to take some of the rl;:l:s l-hat the men in prison have t a Icon?  When, instead of aaliing leaders to lead them, are they going to a tow that they are worthy of being led?   (Interruption) *   When am I going to Inspire confidence in you my friend?   If I cannot inspire confidence in you, you cannot have any confidenc In yourself....,..! appeal to you not to let tbis be the end of your demand for free speech.   Vie are demonstrating in the Square and demanding that the rights of free speech shall be restored to the people; we are demanding that the right of free assembly chall be restored to the people, and that public opinion shall be expressed by the people, when, where and how they themselves desire,&quot;Albert Inkpin has since written to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; to say that he is not in prison as was stated in that paper&apos;s leader on July  5th.Money still soems to be scarce at the communistheadquarters:   an -&quot;important and urgent&quot; whip has been sentto all branches urging payment of subscriptions andannouncing that in future &quot;cash should accompany all ordersfor
for members hi j cards.&quot;The Party appears to be still in negotiation with the National labour Press whioh has instructed the Party&apos;s solicitors that &quot;the payment of  206 must be made prior to discussing the matter with the Communist Party,&quot;   It is probable that this sum represents the fine recently imposed upon the Press for which the Communist Party would have accepted responsibility had the Press not ceased to print the &quot;Communist&quot;,   There is little doubt that the Party is greatly inconvenienced by the change of printer for it is stated in the current issue that &quot;it ia a source of annoyance to us that for technical reasons we aro forced to go to press so far ahead of our date of publication that we aro unable to cormnent on happenings immediately prior to our appearance in print,&quot;London Communists are active at present among the unemployed, particularly in Kensington, Camberwell, Edmonton and Clapham but their statements that there is work end comfort for all in Ihissia will be discounted by the &quot;Herald^s&quot; admission of widespread famine in that country,?aH, Peet has wired  35.10 to the secretary of the Hull branch of the Communist Party for the payment of G,W.Turpin&apos;s fine:   it is not impossible that IVrpin vi 11 take over Dick Beech1a work, as he is well inside the movement and closely associated with the courier service.Information has been received from a foreign source thai the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; receives frequently, if not daily, through the medium of the Soviet liission at Biga, the following literature:   Soviet newspapers, other publications and propaganda, telegrams about the proceedings of the Third Congress of the Third International and a quantity of letters and packages addressed to some private person c/o the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.&apos;James Stewart, Midlands organiser, is concentrating on a more or less underground campaign:   he has arranged forthe/
tho distribution of a large number of leaflots among tho workers in varioua industries, and it is reported that he is now turning his attention to the Sorvices:   his idea is to get one man from each branch of the Party to join a uni so that leaflets could bo sent to him;   those men would furnish reports to communists who have not yet become notorious.The Birmingham Labour Party has ixtssod a long resolution condemning the recent   prosecutions of communists:   one labour alderman challenged a local detective to take down a speeoh in shorthand and alleged that convictions based u; notes taken by tho local polioo wero. caricatures of Brit tall justice.The Ittnndda Moderation of the Communist Party has decided to sot up special unemployed committees irnmediatolyl this has already been done in Porth, Mid-Raondda and Cwmparf A,J, Cook informed the Porth branch on July 17th that he wds definitely resigning his membership,of tho Communist Pa &quot;beoauao the Party wanted weeding, at present there were to many undesirables, as it wore, within its ranks.&quot;   Cook added that although he would be no longer a member of the p:\rty he was always there actively to support and assist it and, if necessary, to speak for it.On July 20th a deputation from the Communist Party waej received by the Glasgow Txvdes and Labour Council:   a gen ox strike on behalf of tho imprisoned extremists was urged; the Trades Council decided by 37 to 13 that a general strike was &quot;a ridiculous proposition at tho prosont juncture.&quot;The Glasgow brunch telegraphed last week to headquarter for 8,000 more agricultural leaflets: 2,500 copies only hai/ boon sent as those oxhaust tho stock but 5,000 copies of a reprint with slight alterations are to be sont as soon aspossible/
possible. The Glasgow Green audiences are still affected by the imprisonment of John McLoan and Sandy Ross, but as these men have nearly finished their sentences their followers anticipate larger meetings in the near future. It is stated that John McLean intends to visit South Wales and Sheffield for propaganda purposes.

On July 16th the Northern District Council (Scotland) of the Communist Party appointed J.B. Payne of Aberdeen chairman, P. McIntosh of Lochee secretary and G. Dalgety of Lochee treasurer.



THE RED TRADE UNION INTERNATIONAL

It is reported that on July 19th Losovsky laid down the following conditions for affiliation to the Red Trade Union International, which were subsequently accepted unanimously:

"(1) Realisation, not only in words, but in fact, of the class struggle.

 (2) Acceptance of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

 (3) Prohibition of the simultaneous adhesion to Moscow and Amsterdam.

 (4) Co-ordination of the action inside each country - action directed against the bourgeoisie.

 (5) Recognition of international proletarian discipline: that is to say, obligatory submission of national

     to decisions taken by the international Congress."

In the course of his speech Lesovsky emphasised the advantage, for revolutionary ends, of industrial over craft unions. Another form or organisation proved necessary by the experience of Russia and Western Europe was the workshop and factory committees. The bourgeoisie had endeavoured by adopting and regulating these committees to render them harmless by paralysing their revolutionary will. The German Industrial Councils were an instance of this. But these statutory bodies ought to be used. To oppose to such bodies elected by the mass of workers others elected by a few revolutionaries would be folly.

The third  question was that of the attitude of revolutionary/


revolutionary trade unionists to tho established unions, sot of extremists urged that thoy should leave tho unions any cost.   But the right policy was to remain inside the unions;, not to create feeble Lillputian now bodies.At tho. closing session Tom Mann was elected a member the Bxooutive Bureau of tho Rod Trado Union International this consists of seven members of tho larger Bxocutive Committee on which the following countries have represent Russia (4); Germany, England, U.S.A.;franco * Poland, Czo Slovakia, Italy, Spain (2 each); smaller countries (1 eacThe following extracts are taken from a lottor writtfrom Moscow by J,T. Murphy to his wife on 9th July:&quot;The Whole cloud of suspicion which was raised against rao, successfully enough to cut me out from m of the proceedings, besides tho mental and nervous s it engendered simply made it impossible for mo to do but little.   To-day I addressed the T.U. congress fo the fire$ time.   This I hear has had a good effect, may gaVfurther opportunities and if so   I shall certainly take them.   Tho Committee of Investigation cleared me all right.and that rolievod my mind (considerably and I am doing my best to got into my &quot;stride again.   But the main damage has been done and will moan hard work for many days to come to rub out everything that has been done a&amp;ainst me.&quot;What a terrific stru^lo is procoeding here, is to hand&apos; that a terrible drought has literally bur up the whole of the harvest east of tho Vol^a to the Urals,   For months the sun has blazed down intensely upon the vast plain without a drop of rain to relievi the parched,crops.  West of the Volga I believe is much bettor than last year, but it is evident that t) food situation is.not going to be relieved for a Ion; &apos; timo to come.   Meanwhile the armies of the unemployoi all countries outside Russia grow even greater and tl nations nmdly v&apos;pluhgod in ventures which make for further conflagrations.    ,&quot;The. new lines, of action laid down by the Congrc demand a&apos; service which v/i 11 tes % every rev oiuti onary adherent. ,ta t,he uttermost.

Leon sue 1 rare &quot;stormy $imas&apos;ahead for us in Britain. Rare fig in the Party, in, the unions ,and everjrwhero.&quot;The officials of the Red Trade Union Internationalapparently expect a period of Intense activity:   Jacksonhas/
has informed Crossley that &quot;there is every possibility that tho Rod Trade Union International organisers will receive instructions, as a result of the Congress just concluded at Moscow, to immediately arrange for an intensive propaganda campaign throughout the Trade Union movement,   The greatest problem will be to find a sufficiency of speakers to moot tho ne o 6 b s ary d emand,11John. Henderson, one of tho loaders of the Glasgow Amalgamated Engineering Union &quot;Bobol&quot; group, has interviewed one of my correspondents regarding employment in Soviet Kuasia:   he stated that six men, preferably engineers, are wanted and that they would probably be sont to work. In the machine-tool department of the Singer factory in Russia:   my correspondent thinks that William Leslie is behind this offer:   ho was given to- understand that tho Soviet Government contemplates tho manufacture of agricultural implements.Tho Stirlingshire district secretary of the Workers1Committee Movement has sont his report to A.V* Williams, thenational secretary:   he states that the movement is only inthe initial stage but that&quot;the annual election of branch officials and committees will considerably strengthen us, as we are quite sure that we will swoop tho board in some of the branches.   Re revision of county rules mentionod in your letter, being a member of tho B9C. of Scottish Miners (unofficial movement, H.W.C.1L Ktiners Section) that we are taking all steps necessary or possible in this section.   An official sub-committeo (of Scottish Mine Workers Union) have prepared a draft constitution and rules (which does away with tho county union) which has to gp before branches for ratification or amendment.   We have prepared a whole sorios of amendments (an entirely new draft) which we will print and circulate throughout all our groups in Scotland,&quot;Ho adds that committees have been formed and are doing fairly well at Shioldhlll, Cowio, Plean, Lenny, Carrenhill, Dennyloanhead and Eilayth:   the movement, on tho whole, appears to have made little progress in Piirlingshire but the, j?r^anij^s^r^^&amp;ing Energetically in these and other small villages,THE/
\THE UNEMPLOYEDTho decrease In tho mmCcxrr^o: iiZMz&amp;Juary^ ,,.&amp;mtim&amp;a^ a good deal of unrest is simmering.    Harrington of tho London District Council&apos;is responsible for the agitation i London and was present on July 25th when a procession of unemployed marched from Clapham Junction to ,;andsworth Workhouse, where a number of unemployed are housed.   There has been some friction at the Workhouse owing apparently * to an attempt by tho unemployed to take possession.It i3 reported that another attack on the headquarter of the Amalgamated UnGinoering Union i3 contemplated but the loaders arc doubtful as to their ability to procure a following.Although the numbers of unemployed In Birmingham and district have declined during the peat week or two the number of unemployed, throughout this district remains higl In the Old Hill.and. Baleaowen districts there is still much unemployment among those who were throtm out of work by the coal strike:   there is at present no prospect of a general return to work and tho local education committee has decided to feod necessitous schoolchildren for the next few weeks.   In the Rocditoh district tho unemployme position is acute and the Bromagrove Board of Guardians being asked to relievo cases of distress. .     SfeCrSer&amp;eant Major A.M. V/f/.;staff, known as &quot;the man chains&quot; led about 1,000 unemployed to the Council H%use, Birmingham  on 20th July and presented tho Lord Mayor wi a petition soliciting attention to their grievances.   Tli petition urged that there should be a spooial council ., mooting to take/immediate steps to remedy the starvation and deprivation that ex-soldiera, war widows and ehildrel are experiencing.   A general inspootion should be made flj once of those who, uadesirous of doles, wish    for worB:and/
and bettor conditions under which to live.   -Tho men also asked if some organisation could not- ho formed to visit those ex-soldiors who were still in hospital,Tho Lord Mayor suggested that since ox-3orvicc men wore now organised in one body, that body might advcmtagoously organise visitors.In regard to Wa;vstaff, who says that he is visiting Glasgow in tho near future, there is a strong suspicion among- local ox-Service men that ho is wandering about the country for his own ends, that he is getting a good living, in this manner and is not really genuine in his pleading on bohalf of ox-Service mon. . -The position in Lancashire and Choshire is improving, although the strike of shipyard joiners is hamporing trade: at Barrow a number of largo vessels are on the stocks but cannot be completed and Victors have issued a notice extending tho holidays until August 9th in consequence of the strike.   The cotton operatives expect to-be working full time In the near future.   In Yorkshire alsj there are hopes of a trade revival.On July 20th a procession of unemployed marched to the Town Hall in Sunder!and, where&quot; a deputation was received by the Council:   the men were informed  hat tho Council had agreed to start work immediately on schemes for the provision of a salt-water,bathing pool and for the improvement, of a number of thoroughfares in tho town. Tho procession dispersed quietly,COreCCTION UPHILLOn July 22nd tho Salford Recorder, In a considered judgment, found that the appeal of   George ?eet and Timothy  ime against conviction for the printing and publishing of&quot;the leaflet &quot;A Call to Action&quot;, had failed: tho Imprisonment will, however, be served&apos; in the second division/
Division.On July 20th Do Valora mot members of tho Executive of tho Irish Self-Determination Loajuo, the Gaelic League and other Irish societies at the Grosvenor Hotel, and load a consultation with them as to the working of their organisations in Groat Britain.   It is possible that he wished to ascertain the views of some of the Irish outside the ranks of Sinn Foin.(There has boon a lull in Sinn l^ein activity in this country, oiling to a general feeling that nothing should bo said or done which would interfere in any way with the prospects of peaco:   in London it is thought that the foundation of a settlement has boon laid and that it only remains to consult Dail I3iroann and work out details There is, however, a small section of extremists in        j England, and a larger one in Scotland, who are opposed to any settlement other than a republic:   in Liverpool, Manchester and hewart /oastie-on-Tyne it appears that any settlement   accepted in Ireland would be welcome. Agitators in the Liverpool and Manchester district ha vis boon remarkably quiet during tho wook owing, principally, to recent convictions and to tho truce in Ireland.Glasgow Sinn Joiners, who are closely connected with labour extremists, make no secret of tho fact that dominion Homo Rule would not be acceptable to them.   OnJuly 82nd, 18 of tho 31 prisoners detained for trial in glasgow in connection with the attack on a prison van and]tho nurdor of Inspector Johastone wore discharged.Anticipating thoir release groups of people assembledoutside tho prison during the afternoon ani greetedenthusiastically Father MoRory; James McGlinchey, whowas arrested in connection with the despatch of armspacked as eggs from Dundee to Glasgow, has also beenreleasolm
the Government&apos;s terms as a basis of discussion, and hopes to win over the representatives of the Northern element at the Conference tablereleased:   indictments of conspiracy and murder have been served on the remaining 13 prisoners.   The release of father McRory after several weeks detention has revived the controversy over the detention of prisoners awaiting trial and it ia possible that tho Roman Catholics of Glasgow will make some representation upon this matter to the authorities,IRELANDThe situation is still very obscure, although, generally speaking, a more hopoful feeling prevails.   The average Sinn Fciner is inclined to forego tho Republican idea if a broad measure of Dominion Home Rule can be obtained, but there remains a strong element whose cry is &quot;A Republic or nothing.&quot;   They think and say that the conference was a groat triumph for Sinn Fein and profess to see in it m. admission of defeat on the part of the Government.   Since tho truce, except for the rioting in Belfast, the country generally has been remarkably quiet.It ia said on good authority that before refusing an offer of Dominion status, de Valora will ascertain the wishes of the peoplo by plebiscite.On hie return de Vrlera first saw Collins and thanked &apos; him for the way in which he had kept &quot;the boys&quot; in hand. Collins will not hoar of any move unless the peace talk breaks down, but ho has prepared a full programme of operations to follow that event.-Dq Valera is reported to have advised the acceptance of
