It was as high as 7-8 per cent, in 1908 and 7-7 per cent, in 1909.throughout 1919 it ranged between 1-6 per cent, in September and 3-2 per cent.in December, and averaged 2-4 per cent, for&quot;the year.

GENERAL.Unemployment appears to be diminishing gradually, but in some areas the demobilisation of the Defence Force has produced a temporary increase in the local Exchange Live Registers. When larger coal supplies become available, the revival of trade will be more marked. It is estimated that there are approximately 100,000 coal-miners who have not yet been able to resume work. In the iron and steel trade no general resumption of work has yet taken place, but the outlook is considered to be brighter. Both in this and in the tin-plate industry many employers are reluctant to recommence operations until coal prices are fixed. The improvement in the cotton and woollen industries continues, but production is at present hindered by the shortage of fuel. The position in the boot and shoe trade is unchanged. Certain sections of the hosiery trade are working full time, but in the lace industry no -general recovery is expected at present, owing to seasonal depression. Many pottery firms have now resumed manufacture, but normal conditions are not expected to return for several weeks.II. EMERGENCY WORK.As announced by the Prime Minister on the 19th October, certain schemes have been put in hand bv the Local Authorities in conjunction with the Ministry oi Transport and the Ministry of Health, and by the Local Authorities themselves, designed to secure work for unemployed men, preferentially ex-Service men. The following is the result at this date: (a.) New Arterial Roads.20.938 men employed up to date (in and around London, 3.477; Provinces, 17,461).(b.) Road Maintenance.It is estimated that employment has been provided for approximately 20,000 men over and above those ordinarily so employed. .(c.) Housing (Acceleration of the Lay-Out of Roads and Sewers and Approved Housing Schemes).Men employed up to the 8th July, 2,682 (in and around, London, 264; Provinces, 2,418).(d.) Lord St. Davids&apos; Committee.Men employed on work other than the above up to the 8th July, 29,098 (in and around London, 4,555; Provinces, 24,543).(e.) Alternative Work in Government Establishments.War Office establishments: men employed up to the 9th July, 2,551 (in and around London, 1,982; Provinces, 569).Alternative work provided in Admiralty establishments: men employed up to the 9th July, 6,317 (in and around London, nil; Provinces, 6,317).(f.) Short-time in Government Establishments.Number of men who have found employment up to date as a result of the intro-duction of short-time system. Men employed up to the 9th July: War Office estab-lishments, 1,900 (in and around London, 1,802; Provinces, 98) ; Admiralty estab-lishments, 2,388 (in and around London, 180; Provinces., 2,208).(g.) Emergency Work found by Local Authorities.Total number of men employed up to the 8th July, 12,363 (in and around London, 2,404; Provinces, 9,959).Total labour employed on above 801161-1168 = 98,237.[6640]
As reports for the week ended the 8th July have been received from only 395 Local Authorities out of 436 who were asked to furnish information, it is probable that the Relief Schemes which have been inaugurated by the Government and Local Authorities are finding employment for a number of men in excess of the figures given.Bousing [Labour Position).On the 1st July there were 79,415 skilled men employed on housing schemes in England and Wales and 63,926 unskilled. (The additional labour still required was 4,353 skilled men and 139 unskilled.)III. 50,000 EX-SERYICE MEN TO BE TRAINED IN THE BUILDINGINDUSTRY.The industrial stagnation caused by the coal stoppage, and the consequent uncertainty of the outlook, have seriously interfered with the progress of this scheme. The employers, however, have set up District Committees in many of the more important industrial centres, and the National Federation has instructed its members to post notices on all jobs advising their workpeople that the job is only open to men willing to work with and assist in the training of ex-Service men taken on under the scheme. This action has already been taken in London by the Master Builders and also by the Office of Works.Intimation was made in the House of Commons on the 29th June that as from the 1st September next contracts, in which the Government is financially interested and on which bricklayers, plasterers, slaters and tilers are to be employed, will in general be confined to contractors who are employing men under the conditions of the scheme. Government Departments have made arrangements to draw the attention of all their contractors to this intimation, and steps have been taken to urge contractors to apply the scheme to current contracts as well.In the meantime, the total applications are 20,626. In the London and South-Eastern Division 8,907 men have applied, and the following are figures for other Divisions: South Midlands and Eastern Counties, 1,486: South-Western Counties, 1.907; West Midlands, 1,994; Yorkshire and East Midlands, 1,655; North-Western Counties, 2,604; Northern Division, 591; Scotland, 1,190; Wales, 292.IV.
