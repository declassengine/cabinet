The wholly unemployed, excluding miners, on June 24tb numbered 2,178,000, and short time workers 953,290.De Valara has not yet accepted the Government invitation. He himself desires e settlement, but Collins is uncompromising, and holding, as he does, the Irisn Republican Army, he is the stronger of the two.   If he allov s the invitation to be accepted it/will be r-ith reservations.   Meanwhile, the Sinn l^ein outrages continue.
THE COAL MINERS

The district returns made to the miners headquarters showed and overwhelming majority in favour of returning to work, the official figures being:-



 For           832,840

 Against       105,820

               _________

   

 Majority for  727,020



Lancashire and Cheshire miners, who followed the advice of their local leaders and rejected the terms, accounted for about 90,000 of the adverse votes.

Telegrams ordering a resumption of work were dispatched on Friday and the miners&apos; representatives signed the agreement on the same day.

As far as the state of the pits and economic considerations allow, work has been resumed in all coalfields. The difficulties of the national federation are, however, likely to be grave and lengthy. Debts and unemployment are two factors which will require careful handling by the leaders: It is estimated that 20% to 25% of the miners will not again be employed in the industry and for some time the percentage will be greater. The various co-operative societies have made credit agreements with the lodges, or the county associations, not the individual miners, although the latter have in many cases agreed to pay off 5/- per week. Under present conditions the men will not only not pay off the 5/- weekly, but will constitute an unemployment charge on their bankrupt unions.

There is friction between the leaders themselves which cannot make for unity in the Federation: Noah Ablett has stated that Messrs, Hodges, Smith and Robson want to Chequers without the knowledge of the Executive/

The Ablett type.^Parrot-like we were crying ^ool1 when we could have grasped wages with both hands.    &apos;c -&quot;Six Weeks, went byf; and in the presence of my two colleagues, I informed the House of Commons that we were prepared to. discuss any proposition as to wages.&apos; &quot;We could have had a splendid; wage settlement next day, but we lost the tide,&quot;Wny?  Because of the Ablett type of mind, already charged with stories of the *Sres.t Betrayal1,&quot;The, deroocratip guillotine  w&amp;a applied ,   Tho *8reat Betrayal1 mentality also lost us the support of the Triple Alliance.* - ;The faot remains, however, that the extremists have not yet lost their hold as is proved by the resolutions demanding the resignation of the three chief officials, andit/
it seems certain that they will exploit to the utmost the discontent which exists in the coalfields.



SOUTH WALES.

About 50% of the miners have been able to resume work in this area but many of these are restive and my correspondents state that as several colliery managements are inclined to insist on technicalities, a number of sectional disputes are likely before the men settle down.

At some of the collieries in the Western (Swansea) district, only a few men have started, owing to the damage caused by flooding, while Cory Bros. Ltd., have decided to close the Glyncastle Colliery Resolve, Vale of Neath, indefinitely as it is unremunerative: about 600 men are affected.

The directors of the Tower Colliery Hirwain, near Aberdare, have notified the local workmen&apos;s joint committee that they do not intend to re-open the colliery until the men have dispensed with the services of their extremist minimum wage agent and checkweigher, Gwilym Richards: the man decided at a mass meeting on July 4th to ask the management to open the pit and to "allow the charges against Richards to be dealt with in a constitutional manner."

There has also been a hitch at Ebbw Vale where the men allege that the Ebbw Vale Steel, Iron and Coal Co. Ltd., refuses to carry out the national agreement and is trying to make operative a local price list based on a scale 40 years old: the colliers affected are the Graig Fawr, Marine No. 1 and Marine No. II at Cwm, the Prince of Wales, Ebbw Vale and the Waun Llwyd Nos. 1 and 2 pits, Victoria Ebbw Vale: about 6,500 men are affected.

The Nine Mile Point Colliery was also idle on Monday owing to an alleged attempt on the part of the management/ 
management&quot; to&apos; impose &quot;local- -concfitions.

Som difficulty has arisen in itfte,; Sheffield district in conneotion with the engine; men who belong .to-.. the union run by ifcv Casey, M.P.    It wi&amp;l be.cpgeiflemberedrtjiat Mr, Casey has vigorously opposed the Minors8 peroration ..of Great Britain during the stoppage and /prew^tad,,hiskmen frm coming but with those en^nemen who belong to the Yorkshire Miners1 Association1.    Under t&amp;ev original terms of the owners theymre to get 10/- per week increase, but now they are to get a reduction of 10/-.    A meeting was held on the 2nd July at Sheffield but Mr. Casey could not give his men any satisfaction beyond a promise from the employers to consider their case at the end of the temporary period.115 miners1 lodges favoured acceptance of the terms and 69 were opposed and of the mechanics, 95 lodges, faroured acceptance and 3 rejection:   the englnemen were practically solid for acceptance.As several collieries in this county have closed permanently, it is estimated that only about two-thrids of the miners employed before the strike will secure re-employment.   In some districts work has been resumed and the output in one case is good;   in others, however, notably 811515 ?n ani Bishop :Auckland , several collieries willnot/
not open until sufficient orders are forthcoming. The management of the Harton Coal Company&apos;s colliery in the South Shields district announced that owing to the decision of the local miners not to accept the terms, no arrangement had been made to open the St. Hilda, Harton and Marsden pits: only two of the company&apos;s pits, Whitburn and Balon, were opened on Monday. Deputations from the local miners&apos; lodge have however interviewed the managers and the pits have now been opened.

About twelve young miners from the Tudhoe miners&apos; lodge joined the Defence Force and their lodge members decided that they should be the last to resume work: the management has declined to conform to this proposal and the colliery is idle pending an agreement.

It is proposed to make a levy on all men who have resumed work to an extent which will enable £2 per week to be given to unemployed miners.



NORTHUMBERLAND

61 miners&apos; lodges voted for acceptance of the terms and 5 against" branches of the colliery mechanics association and of the enginemen and firemen were practically solid for acceptance.

The resumption of work has been as general as the state of the pits allow.



MIDLANDS

The terms are considered unsatisfactory by most of the Midland miners who state that they have won nothing by the strike: indignation against the leaders is extreme, the men alleging that their obstinacy in regard to the pool was the cause of the strike.



WARWICKSHIRE

Many men resumed work on July 2nd: at Tunnel Colliery, ?, 500 tons of coal were drawn on this date/

This branch still has to find  150, the balance of the costs of their action over the Independent lahour  Party rooms.   The movement is making some progress in the Nottinghamshire mining district:   the branch at Mansfield is growing and new branches are being formed at &quot;Woodhouse and Eirby and at Bloswich, Staffordshire.    The sales of &quot;TheCommunist&quot;/
Communist" in Leicester, have dropped from about 100 to 34 copies weekly.

A Socialist Labour Party speaker informed a Castleford audience last week that the local communist leaders put forward "greenhorns" during the strike, in order to avoid arrest. These men, according to a well informed correspondent, all left their homes on May 15th (the day fixed for an unofficial general strike) and went into hiding, because they thought the revolution had come.

The Glasgow Communist Groups is protesting vigorously against "the harsh and brutal sentence passed on Guy Aldred" and is endeavouring to bring the case before all trade union branches.

On June 25th the following communists were elected, at a Kirkcaldy meeting, to the North Eastern Divisional Council (Scotland) of the Communist Party: Chairman J. Bird, Bowhill, Fife; Secretary J. Brown, Gorebridge; Treasurer R. Thomson, Buckhaven. The nine members of committee are: J.H. Payne, Aberdeen Vice-Chairman; G. Goodison, Perth; H. Sturrock, Dundee; A.J. Gordon, Leven, Fife; J. Peterson, Bowhill, Fife; J. Hope, East Wemyss, Fife; G. Allison, Musselburgh; W. McKie, Edinburgh and J. Parkes, Gorebridge. Bird and McKie were elected to represent the Council on the national executive.

Arthur Field has resigned the secretaryship of the Holborn Labour Party and considers that in view of the Brighton decision, all communists should sever their connection with that Party.

J.R. Wilson, who has recently been organising for the communist movement in Lancashire, has been elected organiser in South Wales for a period of three months; he is a propagandist of some ability.

A deputation then proceeded to Witshall and interviewed officials of the Ministries of Transport and Labour and members of the Middlesex County Council regarding the continuation of work on the arteri? road scheme. The deputation returned to Waterloo Bridge, where the procession re-formed and marched home. No disturbances occurred, but it is worthy of note that the "Daily Herald" reported that the marchers numbered 3,000, in consequence, possibly of a statement made by the Tottenham spokesmen. Some of the wilder leaders are advocating extreme action in order to attract the attention of the authorities and the public to the distress in the Tottenham district.



ARREST &amp; CONVICTION

On June 29th Samuel McCutchson, who was arrested as the result of information obtained by this Department, was found guilty of having explosives in his house without lawful authority and was sentenced to four years&apos; imprisonment.

On July 3rd William M&apos;Gill, of the Glasgow Herald League, was arrested on a charge of selling socialist publications on Glasgow Green without a permit.



SINN FEIN IN GREAT BRITAIN

On July 3rd a "Peace with Ireland" demonstration organised by the Women&apos;s International League, was held in Trafalgar Square. Nineteen speakers addressed an audience of about 5,000 from three sides of the plinth. The speeches were milder than those usually made on the Irish question and no disorder occurred.

On July 1st a length of wire fuse, measuring 18 feet, was discovered by the police ? to the Ministry of Pensions&apos; buts in Regent&apos;s Park: it is believed that Sinn Feiners intended to destroy these huts.

Sligo, on 1st July.  The two leading men of the patrol were made prisonersi and a third man was wounded in both arms.
