I. NOTE ON UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION IN UNITED KINGDOM ONJULY 22, 1921.1. The Trade Union figure of unemployment for July 1914 was 2-8 per cent. The average for the ten years prior to the war, according to Trade Union unemployment figures, was 4-7 per cent. It was as high as 7.-8 per cent, in 1908 and 7-7 per cent, in 1909.Throughout 1919 it ranged between 1-6 per cent, in September and 3-2 per cent, in December, and averaged 2-4 per cent, for the year.The figures for 1920 are :- Per cent.To the end of  2-9January   ...        ... ---February ... --- ^March     ...        ... --- q.qApril      ...        ... &quot;* -j.^May     ......... - 1-2June       ...         ...        - - ^.4July       ......... -        V 1-6August    ...        ... ---        :*: 2-9September ... -&apos;        &apos;.&quot;     ^October    ...        ... -,* 3.7November ... &apos;^.qDecemberThe figures for 1921 are :-To the end of  g.gJanuary   ...        ... g.gFebruary ... *&quot; ^q.qMarch     ...        ...        - - ---        &quot;&quot;APril      ..........&quot;&apos; 22-2May        ......... &quot;&apos; 231June2.

GENERAL.A further substantial improvement in the industrial situation is reported, but the full effects of the settlement of the miners&apos; strike will not be evident for some weeks. No general resumption of work has yet taken place in the iron and steel industry, although certain firms have restarted some of their furnaces. Several firms in the tin-plate industry have also recommenced operations, but this trade is still feeling the effects of foreign competition. Most of the shipyards on the Clyde are closed for the Fair holidays, and the shipyards in other areas are largely employed on casual repair work. Further improvement is reported in the cotton trade, and full time working is expected to commence shortly in the Egyptian spinning section. A gradual improvement is also reported in the woollen, lace, hosiery and boot trades. In the fishing industry a considerable number of trawlers have been able to put to sea. Manufacturers in the pottery trade expect to resume full time working next week, and the glass bottle trade has also resumed operations.II. EMERGENCY WORK.As announced by the Prime Minister on the 19th October, certain schemes have been put in hand bv the Local Authorities in conjunction with the Ministry oi Transport and the Ministry of Health, and by the Local Authorities themselves, designed to secure work for unemployed men, preferentially ex-Service men. The following is the result at this date: (a.) New Arterial Roads.20.897 men employed up to date (in and around London, 3,359; Provinces, 17,538)&apos;.(b.) Road Maintenance.It is estimated that employment has been provided for approximately 20,000 men over and above those ordinarily so employed.(c.) Housing (Acceleration of the Lag-Out of Roads and Seivers and Approved Housing Schemes).Men employed up to the 15th July, 2,828 (in and around London. 245; Provinces, 2,583).(d.) Lord St. Davids&apos; Committee.Men employed on work other than the above up to the 15th July, 27,430 (in and around London, 4,458; Provinces, 22,972).(e.) Alternative Work in Government Establishments.War Office establishments : men employed up to the 16th July, 2,302 (in and around London, 1,785; Provinces, 517).Alternative work provided in Admiralty establishments: men employed up to the 16th July, 6,176 (in and around London, nil; Provinces, 6,176).(f.) Short-time in Government Establishments.Number of men who have found employment up to date as a result of the intro-duction of short-time system. Men employed up to the 16th July : War Office estab-lishments, 1,607 (in and around London, 1,540; Provinces, 67); Admiralty estab-lishments, 2,101 (in and around London, 170; Provinces, 1,931).(g.) Emergency Work found by Local Authorities.Total number of men employed up to the 15th Julv, 13,007 (in and around London, 2,379; Provinces, 10,628).Total labour employed on above 801^168 = 96,348.[6076]
As reports for the week ended the 15th July have been received from only 399 Local Authorities out of 436 who were asked to furnish information, it is probable that the Relief Schemes which have been inaugurated by the Government and Local Authorities are finding employment for a number of men in excess of the figures given.III. 50,000 EX-SERYICE MEN TO BE TRAINED IN THE BUILDINGINDUSTRY.The industrial stagnation caused by the coal stoppage, and the consequent uncertainty of the outlook, have seriously interfered with the progress of this scheme. The employers, however, have set up District Committees in many of the more important industrial centres, and the National Federation has instructed its members to post notices on all jobs advising their workpeople that the job is only open to men willing to work with and assist in the training of ex-Service men taken on under the scheme. This action has already been taken in London by the Master Builders and also by the Office of Works.Intimation was made in the House of Commons on the 29th June that as from the 1st September next contracts, in which the Government is financially interested and on which bricklayers, plasterers, slaters and tilers are to be employed, will in general be confined to contractors who are employing men under the conditions of the scheme. Government Departments have made arrangements to draw the attention of all their contractors to this intimation, and steps have been taken to urge contractors to apply the scheme to current contracts as well.In the meantime, the total applications are 20,937. In the London and South-Eastern Division 8,995 men have applied, and. the following are figures for other Divisions: South Midlands and Eastern Counties, 1,518; South-Western Counties, 1.934; West Midlands, 2,013; Yorkshire and East Midlands, 1,678; North-Western Counties, 2,685; Northern Division, 601; Scotland, 1,209; Wales, 304.The number of men actually accepted is 202.IY.
