The socialisation of industry is likely to be a plank in the election platform in consequence of Labour&apos;s contention that until the workers control the price of commodities wape increases are practically valueless.Among the working classes there is a good deal of opposition to the curtailment of the Government housing plans; the workers maintain also that the fall in the cost of living has affected chiefly luxuries and that increases in rent, coal and gas, together with the price of essential foods do not accord with war:e reductions.Arrangements are being made to hold a &quot;Free Speech&quot; demonstration in Trafalgar Square on Sunday next.iIn.England and Ireland the truce is being maintained.
THE OPAL MIHERSL-. -       4;There has-he-en little change in the situation in the coal fields:   men are being taken on as the mines are being made fit for work, hut the percentage of unemployed is still high.Preparations have been made for the establishment of a district Board for South Wales and Monmouthshire and a committee has been appointed to deal with the disputes which have arisen at various collieries.Feeling is still running strongly regarding the Hodges-Ablett dispute;   it is alleged that, on the day after their visit to Chequers, Hodges, Smith and Kobson withdrew from the executive meeting to consider the issue of instructions for resumption of work over their own signatures only.About 7,000 miners are still unemployed in Nottingham and the liabilities of the Association were stated by Varley on July 17th to amount to about  140,000.Work has been resumed at twelve collieries in the Forest of Dean, hut work at the Cannop Colliery is still confined to pumping and road-mending:   the Howbeach Colliery at Wallsend is being dismantled and 2,000 of the 8,000 miners in the locality are still unemployed.. In Northumberland the majority of miners has been able to resume work but on July 11th 22,000 Durham miners were still unemployed and it is estimated that of this number about 8,000 will not be taken on again owing to the decision of the owners to eliminate as far as possible non-productive labour.My correspondent reports that the &quot;Sack the Loaders&quot; movement is gaining ground in Lanarkshire and the Iotihians and that there is much recrimination at meetings:   abott 18,000 miners are still unemployed in Lanarkshire and^hose in work are being levied 2/6 a week:   the miners do not   ... object to paying this levy but insist that the moneycollected/
collected shall be distributed locally.A.V. Williams is in Lancashire, organising workers&apos; committees:   he is an indefatigable worker and will do more for his movement in a few weeks than local organisers have done this year.    He is in touch with two of tho official delegates of the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners1 Federation is doing his utmost to give a definite revolutionary trendj the dissatisfaction with the coal settlement which is particularlykcute in these count!63*The &quot;D:.ily Herald&quot; reported yesterday that its fund for the miners, which has now closed, totalled about  05,000,My correspondents report a further slight decrease in the number of unemployed but the failure to settle the strike of the shipyard joiners has caused keen disappointment.    In Lancashire there are signs that trade is improving and a considerable increase in employment is expected in the near future.The Communists are again devoting a good deal of attention to the unemployed whom they keep in a state of perpetual ferment,Further demonstrations of unemployed are reported from the Sunderland district;   one on July 13th was attended by about 4,000 men who marched to the Town Hall carrying banners -with the following inscriptions:-&quot;Starving in the richest country in the world11, &quot;1914 a grateful country will never forget you - 1921 you can go to Hall&quot;.    A deputation interviewed the Council, who agreed to provide meals for the children and to consider the possibility of further relief measures.In South Vfales the communists are particularly active among; the miners who have not yet been absorbedton/
on July 12th about 2,000 men attended a mooting at Aberamah which was addressed by prominent local communists.    A resolution was passed dem.vncJ.ing food, clothing and shelter as tho &quot;ri&amp;ht&quot; of the unemployed and calling upon all the workless of the country to organise. corrosindent -is of opinion that in viewof the unemployment, which seems likely to continue for some time in the 3oivchW.rles coal-field, communist organisation may become a serious factor.On the vest coast of Ceotland there is some discontent owing to the influx of a considerable number of Irish potato ciggers,    Although these peoplo come annually to Scotland it ia thought that some of the many thousands of unemployed Scotsmen should, have the chance of doing tho work.       &apos; *- -WB G0l:i^ifl-ii^3.Tho communists are -still concentrating on   industrial organisation, but are devoting special attention to the unemployed,     T-;e free speech agitation has abated somewhat and my correspondent reports from South Ualea that the Trade and Labour Councils, which a &quot;short time ago, threatened trouble over recent prosecutions, are now allowing the ratestion to drop.At Manchester there is a noticeable decrease in the number of people who attend communist meetings:   on July 17th the audience in Stevenson Square varied from 30 - 100 persons, whereas a neighbouring;, patriotic meeting was&apos; attended by about 800 peoplo. .On the same day the Coventry communists, celebrated &quot;Convict Ounday&quot; by holding a meeting at which all the speakers&apos;were men who had recently-served terms of imprisonment:   they were L. Jackson, Jesson and Sheyperson of Birmingham, W. Gallagher and Tom Dingley.During/
During the speeches of the two last ndined there was opposition from the audience who objected to the glowing accounts of Russia under the Soviet regime.     The Coventry branch has nov; obtained the use of a building in whioh to hold meetings, the local branch of the Plebs League acting as guarantor *    Wobb*s propaganda campaign has been more successful than was V/. McLaine&apos;g and the collections, which amounted during the first four days to  4.15.3., were belter than is usual on those occasions.    Webb hopes to 2om the nucleus of a Red Guard at Coventry.Leicester branch was unable to pay its duos to the Divisional Council again last week and cannot settle thi literature debt of  1.7.^&apos;. due to headquarters, as theii credit balance in only 17s. Ey correspondent is, hoi of opinion that this branch will make much more progreffl if some of the locrd leaders who are unpopular can be si aside.In the vfest Midlands James Stewart is working actively to promote new brmches of the Party and progress has been made at West Bromwich, 3methwiok and Walsall:   in Derby the membership does not exceed 18 ai at Worcester and Bloxwich branches have not yet been I formed:   at Dudley Stewart*s attempts have failed owiaJ to lack of support and at V/olverh&amp;inpton the membership! only 13.    In Stirchle? there are signs of opposition I to communist teaching&apos;:   on July 15th five of the Bull I Ring orators held a meeting but were Informed by the I audience &quot;You are Bolsheviks, we aon*t wont you ana you Communist Party up here preaching all this rot&quot;.    Owil to the hostile attitude of the crowd the police advise! the speakers to leave as rapidly as possible. IThe Lancashire Divisional Council has bought a   I van in which tf.V. Jenkin will make a propaganda tour which/1
which is to be self-supporting,    A large, stock of books, including Jaok London^ novels, have been supplied, also &quot;a young comrade who is going to assist to got finance by exhibiting hi a parowess as a banjo player&quot;.    The van is to go to isolated places where communist meetings have never been held.    It starts from Barrow next week.The South Wales Divisional Council -has decided to run a candidate for the Caorphilly constituency and it is reported that the national axecutive has agreed that Robert Stewart, who is at present in Cardiff gaol, shall contest the seat,    Wilson has,commenced his activities as South Wales organiser and addressed a meeting of about 800 at the Plough Tip, Aberaman.*There is a lull in communist activity in Glasgow owing&apos; to the Pair holidays:   most of tho regular speakers have turned their attention to seaside places.The British communists do not appear to have contributed much to the Third Congress of the Third International in* *Moscow,    Kehrhahn, however, spoke at some length on theeconomic position of Russia on July Gth, saying inconclusion:-&quot;We Communist3 could assist Russia to establish her Indus toy by sending experienced workers here who conjoinbly wi oh &quot;ioe Russian workers would energetically begin co ^ -establish industry.    The welfare of Soviet .rfud;j;i.a is ahe business of the Communists of the whole, wjrld, and its destruction.would be a catastrophe   for all our ideas&quot;.It is reported that on June 20th a secret meeting of Russian anarchist communists was held in London, at which a number of oornmunists deported from America were present:   it was agreed to elect a special committee of five, who should devote their entire attention to propaganda in the british colonies/
colonies,    A list of Russian Bolshevik agents in this country has also been received:   several of these are alie Jews who have, been active for some time.THE R223) TRADE UNION INTJi/KNi TIONAli.The Congress of the Red Trade Union International is still sitting in Moscow:   on July 6th Rosmer presented his report on the activities of the Provisional Council and stated that the chief task of the International was to struggle against the Amsterdam Federation;   the experience of France and of England suggested that the best method was the capture of the unions from within.    On the following day the congress debated Rosraer1? report, Murphy and Harm being among the speakers.    Murphy stated that the aim of the proletariat was &quot;to seize the bourgeoisie by the throat and make it surrender its positions - to indicate the way in which this should be done, such is the task of the present Congress&quot;,    The folio win;;, extract from Mann1 s speech is of interest in view of his influence in this count ry:-&quot;The long experience of our struggle with the reformist tendencies of the old Trade Union leaders proves to us onoe more tho necessity at the present moment of making our tactics agree with the real necessity Of the moment,    I shall not speak of other countries, hut I affirm categorically that 20 por cent of the British workers are in a revolutionary state of mind.     It is not necessary to work in suoh a way as to spend the energy of our rather scanty forces, in order to set up an independent organisatioi consisting of these twenty per cent,    We must concentrate our efforts on bringing about radical changes also in the theoretical methods of struggle in the midst of the old organisations, which we have created and developed in&apos;common with the revolutions workers1 masses.    *Ve must not leave the old organisations, but we must recMuit more and more followers by gaining the confidence of tho workers, which form part of them.    In the name of theuflglish/
English workers among which it fill to my lot to carry on revolutionary propaganda of late, I express my firm conviction that not only shall we win tho confidence of organised workers, but that we shall acquire new forces among those who even now do not take any part in the revolutionary struggle.    Wo shall tear asundor the reformist ties, created by the. old leaders and together with the proletarians freed from their influence, we shall overthrow the foundations of the old world.&quot;The British Bureau of the Bed Trade Union International is still establishing connection with various foreign revolutionary centres:   the latest additions, to their list are Portugal, C% echo-Slovakia, Belgium, Athens, Rangoon, Madras and Brazil.Tim Kime has written to Tom Biagley in connectionwith the latterTs release from prison:   a passage inthis letter throws a significant light on the activitiesof the Rod Trade Union International in this country:-&quot;The work that lies before us is of a character that will land us inside for longer periods than 2 months, but we must face it and work for the day when these splendid institutions will be used by us to house the people who are * responsible for the crushing of the working class and the prosecution of those who fearlessly shoulder burdens of our class.    One of the first impressions I got when going Inside was&apos;the usefulness of the place whan used by our side, I expeot the same thing struck you&quot;*The dissension among the leaders of the Workers1 Committee movement has not yet been settled and the executive has demanded from Moaser details regarding the sum of  100 rrhleh was sent him for the purpose of building a new printing machine.THE COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL OP YOUTH *Orders have been issued from Berlin, the headquarters of this movement, for a special week of propaganda from August 26th to september 3rd.    The following extracts are taken from the instructions:-Every/
&quot;Every day of -this week is to be devoted to a special purpose.    So for instance are on Monday meetings to be held in the factories and trade schools during which the Young Communist International is to bo debated upon and.propaganda to be made for the 4th of September.    On Tuesday the press propaganda i3 to sot in, and papers, pamphlets, the &quot;Young International1 etc., are to be sold on the streets and in the factories and trade schools. Wednesday, posters are to be put up and hand bills distributed.    On Thursday outdoor and indoor meetings of adult and young workers are to be held where the comrades are to speak on;   The Young Communist International, its Objects and its purpose.    On Friday, if possible, propaganda demonstrations are to bo held in the different quarters o  the cities where great posters and signs are to be carried pointing out the object and the demands of the Young Communist International and tlid importance of the 4th of September.    During the whole week collections are to&quot;be taken up everywhere for the. International Fund, which activities are to broaden out into an extraordinary Day of Collection on Saturday&quot;.&quot;All party organisations are requested to participate&apos;in this Day.    Sympathising organisations 1 trade &apos;unions, smarting clubs&quot; or political nrganisation:.lmust also be asked to participate and to demons ^n/w for tho Slogans of the Young , Communist International, v&amp;ich later on will&apos;bo communicator to the respective organisations.    These slogans will in the first place.,take account of the decisions of the !,&apos;^rld Congress now sitting in Moscow&quot;.&quot;Y7e expect that all organisations affiliated &apos; with us will do their   utmost in preparing the&apos;Day,  I which is to be a black day for the bourgeoisie. Therefore,, young comrades, get &quot;busy;&quot;- - I&quot;Tho organisations in the English-speaking I coxuitries-Will in the course of a few days receive I special instructions&quot;. IArrangements have also been rrr.de to field an Iinternational conference about tho 4th September in london and the Young Workers1 League has been asked to   make the necessary arrangements. ITHE &quot;HMDS 03?j? RUSSIA&quot; MOVSMT.The various committees of this movement, which have functioned in a more or less desultory manner since theformation/
formation of the Communist Party, appear to be short ofmoney, and W..P, Coates has informed the Edinburgh branchthat the strain on the funds- of the national committeemake a grant impossible at present.    He adds:-&quot;Vfe are having to send a deputation to Poland, and in addition will probably have to support a vigorous campaign in connection with the Par Eastern Republic,&quot;As you.know the British Government have-refused to recognise the Par Eastern Republic, and Japan is now occupying the Republicrs only two ports in the Pacific, thus effecting a virtual blockade of tho country&quot;,SEIZURE Qg TRADE MI OH OB1! CES,On July 18th about 200 &quot;rebel&quot; members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union seized the headquarters of their union in Peckham Road:   they remained in possession until the following day when the police, at the request*of the executive, appeared to eject them.    The &quot;rebels&quot; thereupon walked quietly out as the police walked in.It is worthy of note that among the deputation who subsequently interviewed the officials were the communists W, McLaine and W, Harrington,    There is evidence that the action of the extremists v/as not unconnected with the Red Trades Union International,    S,G,R. Bowler, Secretary of the West London Worker^ Committee, who was associated in March 1920 with Kime, Ramsay and other notorious shop stewards has been in communication with Kline and requested him on July 13th to work up an agitation in other districts and to send delegates to the &quot;provisional Executive Committee&quot;.    He stated tha$ the plans arose &quot;out of a growing disgust of the Executive Committee^ general action&quot;. , .An S.0,3. was despatched to the &quot;Worker&quot; by Bowler on July 18th:- &quot;Took/
&quot;* io **&quot;Tool: A.E.U. Head Offices to-day (Monday) 1G.7.81 at 4 p.m. financial help rooulred limned i at oly&quot;.TH8 RAIJ;\MJCT.The position in regard to the railyaymen, who are rapidly approaching decontrol, was staged, probably with accuracy, b, Mr. Cramp at Bo 1 ton on July 17th. He said:-&quot;It is, I think, a matter for congratulation that the wages of rai+Yiaymon are regulated on a sliding scale ruu-d by the cost of living.   Through this railwaymea bare been safeguarded from the kind of calamities which have been forced on other industries.    Various speeches made by Chairmen. of Railway Companies, however, rather indicate that an attack on the basic rates of pay is intended. If such an attacre is made, I for one will do my beat to see tL,at every wheel on,the railways in the United Eirgdom is stepped, but 1 am hopeful that that wiU not be necessary,    1 think that 1 can discern a more conciliatory spirit amongst the railway companies, and I think I can predict that no wholesale attack will be made upon the basic rates;    The basic rate, as apart from the sliding scale, covers a 100 per cent advance over the pre war rates, but the wages in pre war days were such that no self respecting men ought to have been called upon to accept.    These wages could not have afforded the men a standard of existence; not to &apos; mention a living.    In the circumstances, however, &apos; I am looking forward to the future-with great confidence and 1 do not anticipate any great changes will be made on&apos; Auguafc&quot; 15th11..&apos;&quot;Ho Industry can pay adequate remuneration to the people in it unless it can be worked efficiently.   I therefore appeal to&quot;you, not only to take a pride in your trade union, but in the industry in which you are engaged&quot;.&quot;It- is. however, worthy of note that the Glasgowextremists are delighted with the election ofJ. ferchbanks to the presidency of the national Union \of Railwaymen:   they regard him as distinctly advanced in his views, but it is probable that the&quot;responsibilitywill curtail his tendency to make wild/speeches.:       . - : -ARRESTS/

IRELAND.It is reported that the feeling among the leaders of Sinn Fein in Ireland as to the fulfilment of their aims and objects at the peace negotiations in London is not so hopeful as was tho case a short time ago.* *There 13, however, as much propaganda as heretofore &apos;and the Irish &quot;Bulletin&quot; in its July issue continuos to writestories of alleged brutality by the Crown Forces and to laudthe achievements of the individual heroes of the Irish.Republican Army.    Tho pause in hostilities is being usedto organise the Irish Republican Army for the continuanceof hostilities should peace negotiations fail.It is known that a census of all Irishmen in Ireland *between the ages of 16 and 30 has been taken and that conscription will be enforoed.The militant party does not trust the delegates in London and fears the effects on them of the Prime Ministers persuasion.The reoent disorders in Belfast have been brought about by the gunmen of the Irish Republican Army, endure part of a settled policy to render impossible the good government of Ulster.     The Irish Republican Brotherhood is as powerful as it has ever been,is bitterly opposed to the peace negotiations and threatens drastic aotion, should the &quot;neoessity&quot; arise.
