War materiel surrendered by the Germans since the Spa Conference (5th July, 1920), up to 28th July, 1921.C. War materiel surrendered by the Germans since the Allied Ultimatum (5th May, 1921), up to 28th July, 1.921.I. General.On 5th May, 1921, the London Conference sent an ultimatum to the German Government, in which the complete execution of disarmament, in accordance with the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, was demanded.The German Government accepted this ultimatum, and On 12th May, 1921, General Nollet, President of the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control in Germany, notified the German Government of all outstanding questions relating to disarmament, and fixed the dates by which the various decisions of the Inter-Allied Military Commission, of Control had to be completely executed.The various decisions of the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control, enumerated in General Nollet&apos;s letter, and the progress in their execution, are given in detail in paragraph II. below.Although complete reports on all questions raised in General Nollefs letter have not yet been received, it is certain that the German Government has complied to a very large extent with the demands of the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control, and satisfactory progress is being made with the outstanding questions.II. Progress in Disarmament in Accordance with the Demands of the Inter-Allied Militaey Commission of Control.A.-The 100,000 Army.1. Wehrgesetz.The Wehrgesetz (Army Law) of March, 1921, contained various provisions to which the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control took exception; the Germans have now passed the necessary amendments to this Law, and these have been promulgated.(1521/270)   150  8/21  h&amp;s, Ltd.   9360wo
The 100,000 Army organization contained certain units and establishments, which were not in accordance with the Treaty. Orders have been issued by the Reichswehr Ministry to make the organization of the Army conform to the demands of the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control.B. Surrender of War Materiel.1. War Materiel in General.(a.) Excess war materiel in possession of units, dep6ts, &amp;c, of the Army.(i.) The German Government have accepted the maximum establishments for arms and equipment laid down by the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control, and orders have been issued by the reichswehr Ministry for the surrender of all surplus material.(ii.) An increased amount of war materiel has been surrendered since the ultimatum, and Major-General Hon. Sir F. R. Bingham, Chief of the Armaments Sub-Commission of the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control, in a report, dated 16th July, 1921, states that the deliveries of war materiel are extremely satisfactory, and constitute a record for any period, since the Commission has been in Germany.(iii.) General Nollet, President of the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control in Germany, in a report dated 1st July, 1921, makes the following reservations regarding the surrender of war materiel: &quot; The greater part of the surrendered war materiel has actually arrived at the Reichstreuhandgesellschaft dep6ts; transportation to the destruction centres is in progress.In general, units appear to have surrendered a large part of the excess war materiel; some reserve must be made, however, regarding the units in East Prussia. Although the delivery by the Army of the excess arms, which were not surrendered by the appointed date, now appears to have been carried out, the delivery of other material is far from complete, especially as regards optical instru-ments, goniometers, signalling material, equipment and harness.The armouries of units contain spare arms which are not authorized. The German Government has just forwarded a long report on this subject which is being studied. Anti-gas material has only been delivered in very small quantities. It appears that units&apos; have received orders to maintain two masks a man, plus a reserve of 25 per cent. The German Government has been&apos; asked for an explana-tion concerning this.The Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control has had to pay particular attention to the question of signalling material (telephone and wireless material), the delivery of which has been very small up to the present. The German Authorities have tried to keep it or to dispose of it to the Postal Administration, or sell it to various firms, instead of delivering it to the Commission.With the exception of pontoons and field bakeries, destruction is being carried out satisfactorily.&quot;(b.) Arms surrendered by the Civil Population.The German Government claim that this is complete, and the Law for the Disarmament of the Civil Population ceased to be operative on 30th June, 1921.The figures of arms surrendered by the Civil Population and taken over by the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control, are still considerably below the total of surrenders by the Civil Population claimed by the German Government.This discrepancy may in part be due to the difficulty in ascertaining whether arms surrendered emanate from the army, police, unauthorized forces, or from the Civil Population.It is. unlikely that the German Government will be able to obtain the surrender of any considerable quantities of arms from the Civil Population in the future; it is considered, however, that the hiding of a certain number of rifles and machine guns by various political parties and individuals does not constitute any serious menace to the Allies.2. Armament of Land Portresses.All surplus guns, Mineniverfer and machine guns have been surrendered; the remainder of the material is in course of surrender and is being checked.
3. Coast Defences.All surplus ,guns have been surrendered, with the exception of 156 at Wilhelmshaven; 76 of these are claimed for the German Navy, and 80 are required to replace older guns.Complete reports have not yet been received as to the surrender of othes surplus war materiel in coast fortresses.C. Unauthorized forces.1. Dissolution.Orders have been issued for the dissolution of the following : (a.) The East Prussian Grenz- and Ortswehren. (b.) &quot;The Bavarian Einwohnerwehr. (c.) The Orgesch Society.The German Government states that all other unauthorized forces have been previously dissolved.Certain difficulties may be experienced with local societies, formerly affiliated to the Orgesch. These are declaring that they have left the Orgesch, and that therefore they need not be dissolved, as they have no military aims or organization.2. Disarmament of unauthorized forces.(a.) A considerable quantity of arms has so far been surrendered by the unauthorized forces.The following arms have been taken over by the Inter-Allied Military Commissionof Control up to 28th July, 1921, from those surrendered by the unauthorized forces : Guns        ...      ...      ...      ... ...      ...         53Minenwerfer        ...      ...      ... ...      ...         96Machine guns       ...      ...      ... ...      ...     6,319Rifles and carbines......      . ...      ...  696,082. (b.) In East Prussia, the following arms had been surrendered by 2nd July :-Machine guns       ...      ...      ...      ...      ...       202Rifles       ............*    ...      ...    31,000The figures previously declared by the German authorities for this province were : Machine guns      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...       200Rifles        ..................    41,000(c.) General Bingham, in a report dated 29th July, stated that the following arms of the Bavarian Einwohnerwehr had already been taken over by the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control for destruction : Guns        ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 36Machine guns      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      2,680 ,Rifles...................   169,000(Note. It is believed that the 34 Minenwerfer mentioned below have also been taken over by the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control.)The following arms had been declared by the Bavarian Government to be in the possession of the Bavarian Einwohnerwehr in March, 1921 : Guns        ...      ...      ... ...      ...      ... 44Minenwerfer       ...      ... ...      ...      ... 34Machine guns      ...      ... ...      ...      ... 2,780Rifles......... ......... 240,000Considerable difficulties have been experienced in obtaining the surrender of their arms by the peasants in the Bavarian uplands, who have always been accustomed to keep arms, and it appears unlikely that any effective measures can be taken to enforce disarmament in these districts.\d.) In general the progress in the disarmament of the unauthorized forces can be taken as satisfactory.
ID, Police.The German Government has issued instructions with regard to length of service in the police, suppression of transfers between the police and the army, suppression of aerial formations and the limitation of annual discharges in the police, which are satisfactory.The German Government has accepted the total of 150,000 laid down for the police (to include both uniformed and un-uniformed personnel), and has issued orders for the surrender of all surplus arms and equipment held by the police.The Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control are still considering certain questions regarding the general organization of the police and of the police schools.E. Factories.The German Government has accepted the list of factories authorized to manufacture war materiel and has promulgated this list.F. Import and Export of War MatSriel.The German Government has promulgated a new law prohibiting the export and import of war materiel.III. Tables showing the Surrender and Destruction of War Materiel.&apos; -Table A.War Materiel surrendered  and destroyed since the commencement of Control, up to 28th July, 1921.1.
