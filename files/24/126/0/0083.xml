[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1921.CONFIDENTIAL.MEDICAL WITNESSES IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.AT the Cabinet on the 2ftth July the Minister of Health raised the question of medical secrecy in connection with the question which was then upon the House of Lords&apos; Minute Paper in the name of Lord Dawson of Penn. It was then agreed that no time would be available for the discussion of the question before the 27th, the day on which it was to be asked, and it was therefore decided that Lord Dawson should be asked to put off his question. I had then supposed that the question Avould be postponed until the autumn (before which time legislation could not be introduced), and that in the meanwhile I should have time to prepare a reasoned memorandum upon the subject and to circulate it to my colleagues, and that a Cabinet decision could be arrived at after discussion. . Lord Dawson, however, in withdrawing his question, intimated that he intended to put it down again at an early date. It is impossible at this stage that there should be any serious discussion in the Cabinet upon this lengthy and troublesome subject before the House rises, and I therefore think it right to inform my colleagues of the course which I propose to take if the question is asked before the holidays.So far as criminal proceedings are concerned, the Minister of Health, both in correspondence with myself and in communications to the Cabinet, has indicated that he does not support the claim put forward by the doctors. I propose therefore to repel this claim on behalf of myself and of the Government, and to explain and justify the conclusions at which I have arrivedSo far as civil proceedings are concerned, I propose to state that legal opinion as a whole, and particularly those judges whom I have consulted, are opposed to the claim, and that I myself share their view. I propose to set out and define the legal objections, and to inform the House that no decision has been come to by the Cabinet upon the matter ; but that as soon as opportunity allows, the relative weight of the legal and medical views will be considered by the Cabinet, which will reach, and in due time announce, a decision upon the whole question.B.July 29, 1921.[6684]
