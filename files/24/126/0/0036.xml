kilS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) I EC RET,CABINET. WREDUCTION OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURE.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council,The Treasury circular of May 13th requires the reduc-tion of the ordinary expenditure of Supply Services for 1922 - 1923 by approximately 20$.    This demand follows hard upon the heels of another which asked for a substantial reduction in the estimates for the current financial year, as compared with the estimates of 1920 - 21.I am Informed that the last mentioned of these requirements has occasioned a reduction of no more than one and a third per cent over the whole estimates for the ordinary Civil Services.    With this general average I would ask the Treasury to compare the reduction of 1$$, loyally, though very reluctantly, made by the Research Department.    Would ;lt not be fair in considering the further reductions to be made in the estimates of 1922- 23 to take into account the large reductions we have already made in the estimates of 1921-22?I quite admit that even if the labours of the two Advisory Committees, for which I am responsible, were in the long run as remunerative as I believe them to be, it might be necessary to sacrifice the greater ultimate gain in order to obtain the smaller immediate saving.    But I would point out that the greater gain is by no meens always remote.    The Medical Research Council claim that their
investigations into heart and kidney disease have directly saved the Ministry of Pensions, and through them the Exchequer, a sum of  400,000 a year.     I cannot promise . that this, or anything like this, will be repeated in 1922-25;   but there can be no doubt whatever that both in the domain of health and the domain of industry the work of the two Councils with which I am concerned add greatly to the wealth producing powers of the country.     This, I think, is capable of demonstration if anybody doubts it;   but I am net aware that any serious critic has so far brought it into question.I know that these considerations, however powerful in themselves, and with hoviever favourable an eye they may be regarded by the Treasury, are powerless against to argument that our present financial position is suiij !&apos;hat ovon r;!ie most necessary expenditure must be curtailed,     I th-y^-jfore limit my request to this - that in estimating tne total reductions to be made in my Department the savings which have already been made in the estimates 1.921-22 shall be taken into account in determining the amount of the further reductions which are demanded in 1922-23.     I hoptj this policy will receive the favourable consideration of the Treasury and the Cabinet Committee who are going to deal with this subject.       It seems fair in itself;   and the sum involved cannot be large, - important though it be from the point of view of industrial and Medical Research.(Intd).   A.J.B.July 13th, 1921.
