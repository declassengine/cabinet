general.The Communist movement, as even^ the Russians admit, is slowing down. There is little doubt that the internal situation in Russia, which is threatened by a great famine, is a valuable object-lesson. Doubtless the Soviet will play its last cards in a desperate gamble aimed at ctirring up revolution abroad.prance.The anti-Militarist campaign is being conducted with great violence, and appears to have had considerable effect in bringing about the demobilisation of the 1919 class. The Government has introduced a Bill in order to counter this campaign.The Communists have informed Moscow that the revolutionary Syndicalists are making rapid progress.belgium.The new Communist Party is reported to be making little progress. It is much distracted by the jealousies of its two would-be leaders, Jacquemott and Van Overstraeten.italy.There has been much internal wrangling in the Soviet Mission, which has been calmed by explanations from Moscow. Difficulties are probable in the trading activities of the Mission, since the Italian Government refuse to guarantee the immunity of the Russian gold sent in payment of material purchased.An attempt is being made to reach an agreement between the Fascisti and the Socialists to stop the hostilities, which threaten to degenerate into civil war.norway.The recent general strike should perhaps be described as a revolu-tionary trial mobilisation. It has served the purpose of the revolutionaries in that they now know the strength of the means which may be employed against them. The strikers have gone back to work in a mood of bitter disappointment, and widespread class hatred exists.sweden.Early in June a widespread plot was discovered for a Red revolt in Sweden, Norway, and Finland, apparently directed to the formation of a Soviet State in the northern parts of Sweden, Norway, aud Finland. Many arrests have been made.germany.Divisions still exist in the Communist Parties, but signs of a rapprochement are multiplying. A general movement away from the United Communist Party is apparent, and the membership is seriously declining.Trade with Russia does not appear to be prospering. There is talk of co-operation between important German and British firms.A movement is developing for crushing the Stiunes group, both politically and economically.a 2
SWITZERLAND.A Swiss Pro-Irish Committee has been established, and an Irish delegate is reported to be about to arrive in Switzerland.AUSTRIA.The Communist Party is passing through a severe internal crisis. The leaders are suspect and the partisans lukewarm. Great attention is being paid to the permeation of the trade unions, which has progressed so far that the Communist workers have formed an independent section of the lied International.CZECHOSLOVAKIA.The general result of the recent adherence of the Communist faction to the Third International is that negotiations will now be started with a view to amalgamating the Czech and German Communist Parties. A serious result is the loss to the Social Democrats of most of their more intelligent adherents.RUSSIA.The menace of famine is constantly increasing.The condition of the Soviet regime is reported to be very precarious. The government appears to have settled into three groups the extreme moderates, the centre, and the extreme left. Lenin, supported by Trotsky, Dzerjinsky, &amp;c, heads the centre, and is said to favour a compromise possibly resulting in a coalition government as a means of evading the impending catastrophe.M. Krassin, who is now openly fighting*the Third International, has returned to Moscow. It appears that if Krassin fails in his objects he may cut himself adrift altogether from the Communist experiment.The postponed congress of the Third International has at length been held. Ziuovieff has resigned from the Government, retaining the presidency of the International, and his position is now stronger than before.POLAND.The Third International seems to have decided for the time being to take no action to which the Polish Government would object. Illegal organisations are, however, being formed in Upper Silesia.BULGARIA.Moscow has called for an intensification of Communist propaganda.TURKEY.The relations between Nationalists and Bolsheviks continue to be characterised by much distrust and suspicion.The premises of the Russian Trade Delegation at Constantinople were raided at the end of J une, after the discovery of a plot, and certain members of the Delegation were deported.PERSIA.The Bolsheviks appear to be compensating the insistence of the Anglo-Russian Agreement on the cessation of propaganda in the East by maintaining the Russisfn military position in the frontier centres.
AFGHANISTAN.The real aims of the Afghan Mission are said to be to obtain the assistance of Russia, Turkey, Germany, and France in securing the complete independence of the country and its protection against any encroachment.CANADA.Money is said to have been promised to the Communists by the Third International on condition that they unite into one body. Steps are being taken to bring about unification.Considerable unrest still prevails in Vancouver.AUSTRALIA.The Independent Labourites and the Official Party are now reunited as the result of the All-Australian Labour Conference. The Party has elected a Council of Action to further the socialisation of Industry.NEW ZEALAND. ^Steps are being taken to form a Communist Party.UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.The membership of the American Federation of Labour is declining. The Federation has re-elected Mr. Gompers as President, and has repudiated the International Federation of Trades Unions and condemned the Russian Soviet regime as an enemy of Labour.MEXICO.Some steps bave at length been taken to restrict extremist activities, which are constantly growing bolder. There would seem to be little doubt that plans are being laid for establishing a Soviet administration.
CONFIDENTIAL.A Review of Revolutionary Movements in Foreign Countries.PART I.1. LATIN COUNTRIES. FRANCE.Krassin and Trade Relations.Early in June Krassin informed Tchitcherin that there was every reason to. suppose that a Soviet Trade Delegation would shortly he admitted into France. Talking of appointments, he suggested Burenin as trade representative and J. P. Goldenberg as political representative. Goldenberg is one of LitvinofFs entourage, and since he joined the party in order to get Litvinoffs secretarial post, may be assumed to be as much an individualist as his master.Krassin appears to have used as the intermediaries of bis indirect negotiations certain Franco-Russian business men and financiers. It was hinted that the concessions recently made by the Soviet Government were by no means conclusive, and that further modifications were under consideration which would make an agreement with Russia quite accept-able to France. The French Government is, however, stated to have emphatically declined Krassin&apos;s proposal, pointing out that it saw no reason to modify its attitude.The Anti-Militarist Campaign.The mutinies among soldiers referred to in the Review for May appear to have been confined to men of the 1919 class, worked up by Communist propaganda after their recall to the colours. In Marseilles the trouble was limited to a number of men assaulting two N.C.O.s. In a similar mutiny at Brest an officer was attacked. Two or three lorries of troops, sent to reinforce the police and cavalry at a Communist manifestation in Paris, refused to take action against the crowd, threw down their rifles and helmets, and sang &quot; LTntemationale.&quot; They were promptly withdrawn. A quieter spirit is now abroad. The troops of the 1920 and 1921 classes, who are serving their normal period, were absolutely unaffected.A number of anti-militarists have been arrested, including Grondin, a Young Communist and one of the most active militants. Such arrests, however, seem to stimulate the others.The campaign has been successful in that it has obtained the demobilisation of the 1919 class, the Government surrendering to the violence of the extremist press and to the disaffection of the men them-selves. &quot; L&apos;Humanite &quot; can take to itself no small credit for this victory of organised incendiarism. The anti-militarist campaign is now directed especially against the Minister for War.In order to counter the campaign of disaffection, the Government is considering a Bill designed to enable the Courts to deal with cases in which attempts are made to pervert soldiers and sailors, and making it an offence to excuse or justify acts of indiscipline.   The Bill also aims at
protecting &quot; the soldier of to-morrow,&quot; and the preamble insists that the laAv must repress provocations of soldiers to indiscipline, &quot; no matter Avhat form or means may be employed.&quot; The text of the Bill has been approved.The Progress of Communism.There now exist in France two practically distinct Railwaymen&apos;s Federations, one Communist and the other Moderate, but both of almost equal strength. It appears to be certain that the split in the ra il way-men&apos;s federation will be paralleled at each congress of each corporative federation which contains Communist cells. At the Congress of the Builders&apos; Federation, which resulted in a Communist majority, the Moderates submitted without resistance.The continual splits in the Socialist parties and the Trades Unions have resulted in the formation of four Socialist parties : the Independent Socialists, the Parti Socialiste Francais, and the Unified Socialist Party, divided into the Section de 1&apos;Internationale Ouvriere, and the Section de 1&apos;Internationale Communiste. There are two main Trades Union organi-sations : the C.G.T. and the Union des Syndicats de la Seine, Avhose importance has considerably increased since last year.The formation of Communist nuclei in the Trade Unions, known otherwise as &quot; noyautage,&quot; has made disquieting progress. There is some fear that at the Congress of the C.G.T. at Lille in July the Communists will upset the vote not to join the Moscow International taken at Orleans last year.The Congress of Postal Employees has forsaken Amsterdam for Moscow, declaring for the class war and the principles of the Third International. The Reformist Executive has resigned and will be replaced by a largely Communist Committee.Communist Plans.During the period of tension in Franco-German relations, rumour in Communist circles in Denmark was suggesting that negotiations had been proceeding between the German and the French Communists, and that a revolutionary rising in France had been arranged should a new war with Germany be started. The French Communists were said to have received large sums in gold ifrom Russia and arms from Germany. These arms came chiefly from Bavaria and were sent to Alsace-Lorraine. Large stores of rifles were also said to have been hidden in the suburbs of Paris. It would, however, appear to be an exaggeration to talk of a concerted plan between the German and the French Communists and the hiding of large stores of arms. International communism has naturally used the recent situation for its own ends, but police raids have discovered no organised international plot and no depots of arms.The Communists have informed Moscow that the revolutionary syndicalists are making rapid progress. If events are not realised before September they can at any rate be certain that at the National Congress of the C.G.T. Moumousseau, Tommasi and Monatte will replace Jouhaux and his friends. French syndicalism will then he in the hands of men who will lead it along the real revolutionary path.Oriental Intrigues.Dr. Reshad Nihad Bey, Chief of the Islamic Bureau in Paris, has been appointed representative of.the Angora Government in France. He has for French secretary, Jacques do Waldam, who was for many years in Constantinople and who is violently anti British and in touch with all anti-British elements in Paris, including the Indians.    The pair are
apparently used as the direct channel of communication between the Turks in Europe and Mohammed Ali in India and through two Oxford Indian students.One Leon Bouillon, a member of tho &quot; Comite La France ot lTslam,&quot; is keenly interested in the Near East and is said to be an agent of tho anti-Greek section of the French Foreign Office. He seems to be of considerable service to Dr. Reshad Nihad.Members of the Afghan Mission, headed by Colonel Muhammed Wali Khan, have arrived in Paris. No great desire has so far been shown to make the acquaintance of members of the Mission, which is being attended by an official of the Foreign Office during its stay in Paris.Miscellaneous.The French Union of Seamen has accepted a general reduction in wages.French opinion insists that no branch of the International Federation of Unemployed exists in the country.Bidegaray, the former general secretary of the Railwaymen&apos;s Federa-tion, has issued writs against Dejonkerc, Monmousseau and other Bolshevist leaders with a view to regaining possession of the Federation Headquarters. He is asking the Court to order the immediate expulsion of the intruders.There is shortly to arrive in Switzerland a special envoy from Trotsky named Krijanowsky, charged with studying on the spot the revolutionary situation in Western Europe, and more especially the position and chances of communism in France. He is to discover whether or not French trade unionism can be transformed into communism.BELGIUM.Correction.The reference in the April Review to a setback for the Socialists in the communal elections was based on a misreading of figures. As a matter of fact, before the elections the Socialists had a majority in 36 communes out of a total of over 2,600 ; whilst to-day they hold a majority in 218 communes. Neither Catholics nor Socialists seem, however, to have done as well as they expected. The Liberals escaped the defeat which many of them feared as the result of the women&apos;s vote.The New Communist Party.It was mentioned last month that a Belgian Communist Party distinct from existing organisations had come into being. The new party will seek to absorb the existing Communist groups in Belgium, and will ask for the assistance of Moscow. &quot;Noyautage&quot; otherwise the perversion to communism of members of the constitutional socialist and trade union organisations is to be actively continued. The Corn-mission Syndicate, the body to which nearly all Belgian trade unions are affiliated, is alive to the menace and has discussed measures both against &quot; Noyautage &quot; and the attacks of the Masters&apos; Federations.Trade Unionists are in most cases altogether out of sympathy with the proposals of the &quot; Exploite &quot; group to form a new Communist Party, and with its subversive proposals. Many resolutions have been passed protesting against attempts to divide the trade unions and affirming loyalty to the &quot; Commission Syndicale.&quot;The Parliamentary Labour Party and official circles are not displeased with the turning of Jacquemotte&apos;s group to communism.   The Labour
Party can now take definite action to exclude Communists from the &quot; Mai sons du Peuple.&quot;Even in the ranks of the &quot; Exploite&quot; group itself, there exists a well supported movement against the Communist proposals. The authorities have Jacquemotte, Massart, and certain other prominent agitators uudcr constant supervision, and they will not hesitate, if necessary, to enforce the law.   These professional agitators have a wholesome fear of prison.The new group numbers at present only about 1,000 members and is making little progress. The official Socialist organ, &quot; Le Peuple,&quot; attaches no great importance to its formation and doubts whether it has any chances of gaining recruits, unless the economic situation should become considerably worse. The party itself is torn with internal jealousies. Jacquemotte, the founder of the &quot;Exploite&quot; group, and Van Overstraeten, leader of the existing Communist groups, both covet tho leadership. They have gone separately to Moscow, Van Overstraeteu to plead his claim as leader, and Jacquemotte to seek financial help for the movement. Another Belgian subject, who has accompanied Jacque-motte, is J. H. J. Poulet, a member of the Brussels branch of &quot; Les Amis de 1&apos;Exploite.&quot;The followers of Van Overstraeten, as their leader is absent in Moscow, have adopted a waiting attitude, contenting themselves with voting against participation in the new movement. For their part, &quot; Les Amis de l&apos;Exploite&apos;&apos; have not tried to co-operate with these groups. Charles Massart, who is in charge during Jacquemotte&apos;s absence in Moscow, disagreed with his chief as*to the advisability of forming the new party with the aid of the Communist groups already existing. Jacquemotte favoured the seeking of financial assistance from Moscow before making any move in this direction, a course to which Massart reluctantly agreed. C. Van Hainme is the most active member of the new party at the moment. The situation has, on the whole, little changed, but things may move on the return of the leaders.The Labour Situation,The labour situation is considered &quot; satisfactory on the whole,&quot; though proposed wage reductions have stirred unrest amongst the metal workers, and small strikes have broken out in and around Brussels. In Antwerp and other parts strikes have commenced in the building trade against proposed reductions of salaries. These strikes are not, however, likely to spread.The 10,000 to 15,000 colliers who struck in the Borinage district on account of a further five per cent, decrease of wages from June 1st were not long out and resumed work owing to non-participation in the strike by miners in other districts. The reduction had been decided on by the National Mixed Commission ou Mines. A resolution was passed asking the owners of the pits working full time to pay a certain sum on each ton of coal extracted into the regional unemployment fund, to help in some degree to make the weekly incomes of the miners equal a national pool, in fact.The miners did not carry out the recommendation of their National Executive Committee to remain idle one day a week while the British miners&apos; strike lasted. Most of the men were glad to be able to work a full week again. The Miners&apos; Central Bureau sent 50,000 francs to the British miners.A congress of metal workers has passed a resolution that it is the duty of all workers to support the League of Nations.Certaiu members, tired of the political ambitions and Bolshevik ambitions of their leaders, have broken away from the National Federation
of Tramway Employees, and formed a &quot; neutral union,&quot; with headquarters at Brussels. The new union has several hundred members, but is not likely to influence the policy of tho Federation.ITALY.The Affairs of the Soviet Mission.It is reported that Vorovsky&apos;s threat to leave Italy, which resulted in his temporary recognition, was suggested by the Socialists. These were thus given a coveted opportunity of protesting and threatening agitation unless the situation were remedied.All is not going smoothly with the mission itself. The appointment, insisted upon by Krassin, of Vodovozoff to the delegation appears to have caused a great deal of squabbling. In the opinion of Moscow the appointment was&apos; a quite unnecessary challenge to Vorovsky and other members of the delegation. Krassin&apos;s argument was that Vodovozoff would be useful to Vorovsky during the negotiations for the agreement, after which Vodovozoff will be sent to Moscow. Vorovsky himself wrote to Moscow expressing his indignation at the squabbling among the members of the delegation, and giving warning that he would send away any member of the delegation on his own authority, a threat against which Lezhava sent a categorical protest. Lezhava has sug-gested that the collegiate system should be abolished in connection with the delegation in Italy. Naglovsky alone is in the capacity of and should enjoy the rights of plenipotentiary ; all the rest should be his subordinates, and one of them his deputy. A stern order has been sent from Moscow forbidding wrangling. Those who refuse to obey are to be sent at once to Moscow. Meanwhile, after the explanations received Vorovsky has calmed down.Vorovsky has complained that the milling firm of Braida addressed its offers to Krassin through Giannini, ignoring the Soviet Mission in Rome and that he, (Vorovsky,) learned about these offers not from Krassin but from the firm. Litvinoff has insisted on the desirability of carrying on negotiations with Italian firms only through the Rome Mission.As for its commercial activities, the Mission is reported to be negotiating for the supply of military and other material to Russia. The firm of Ansaldo is said to have concluded a 500,0007. contract for the purchase of raw materials, aeroplanes, agricultural machinery, motors, and electrical plant, all of which are ready to be shipped to South Russia. Negotiations have also taken place with the Spa di Torino for 1,000 military lorries, some of which are ready for delivery, and the rest of which will be delivered at the rate of 150 monthly, Difficulties are, however, ahead, for the Italian Government refuse to guarantee the immunity of the Russian gold sent in payment of the material purchased.The New Government, Socialists and Fascisti.Signor Giolitti having resigned office, Signor de Nicola was called upon to form a Cabinet. He declined, and the King thereupon offered the Premiership to Signor Bonomi, a Reformist Socialist, who has accepted.One of the most serious tasks before the Government is to bring about a settlement of the internecine strife between Fascisti and Socialists,
which has been assuming almost the character of civil war. Signor Bonomi is making energetic efforts for peace, and is in conference witli the leaders of both parties.During last month the Fascisti extended their activities to Parlia-ment itself. When the Chamber met to elect its President some Fascisti delegates, with revolvers in their hands, compelled Signor Misiano, a well-known Communist.and deserter, to leave Montecitorio.A recent development of Fascisti activity has been a campaign against the cost of living. Shopkeepers in certain towns, notably Naples and Florence, have been compelled to reduce their prices. For the rest, the tale of murders and destructions of property by the Fascisti and their opponents has continued to come from all the provinces of Italy.The Fascisti have also been paying attention to the Communists. Their vigorous action is said to have made Italy unhealthy for the Hungarian Communist refugees, who are drifting back to Vienna. These people were infesting Northern Italy at the beginning of this year, and receiving a good deal of help from Italian Communists.The Republic of San Marino, which has lately been burdened by an influx of Bolshevist sympathisers from neighbouring provinces, has been raided by Fascisti. The Republic asked the Italian Government for a &quot; loan &quot; of military police, which was granted, and most of the undesirables have now departed.D&apos;Annunzio&apos;s New Dreams.D&apos;Annunzio&apos;s fancy would appear to have turned towards the East-He has seen a prominent Indian revolutionary, whom he asked how all Orientals, and, indeed, all peoples dominated politically and economically by England, might be united in revolutionary action against England. D&apos;Annunzio was told that it was impossible for the Indian Revolutionary Party to take his help, as lie was a pure Nationalist, and was, moreover, siding with the Fascisti movement. In reply d&apos;Annunzio argued his aloofness from the Fascisti and the Socialist, declared that his chief aim was to unite workmen and Fascisti with the Nationalists, and to get a Government which would reverse the imperialism and intrigue which was ruining Italy, and proclaimed his championship of all oppressed peoples. There is little doubt of d&apos;Annunzio&apos;s hatred of France and England, and of his readiness to enter into negotiations with Germany and Russia. He is willing to join the proletariat movement, provided it is not run on Russian lines. Meanwhile he will allow the plan which he has prepared to be placed before the Berlin Indian Committee.Confirmation has since been received of d&apos;Annunzio&apos;s friendliness towards the Indian cause. Both Ismail iKasim and B. N. das Gupta are reported to have seen d&apos;Annunzio in Rome during their last visit, when they were also in touch with some members of the Italian Government.Eastern Intrigues.Abdul Hamid Said and the Egyptian party in Rome are said to be opposed to Adli Yeghen Pasha, of whose loyalty they have doubts. Propaganda in favour of the ex-Khedive and of the Turks is carried out in egypt with the help of some members of the Extremist Party aided by Turco-Egyptians.Enver Pasha is said to have sent Zia Bey to Rome in order to watch the activities of the Angora Delegation and to report on the attitude of the Allied Powers towards it, and to try to win the support of important Turks in Rome for Enver&apos;s organisation in Russia.   Zia Bey affirms that
Euver Pasha is altogether opposed to tho dynasty of tho present Sultan. He secretly favours a Communistic policy and is prepared to support Mustapha Komal and his Government as long as they do nothing to jeopardize the independence of Turkey.Miscellaneous.The Communists Onorato, Mauriello aud Miziano have left Rome for Russia.The police have traced to Rome one Henry Furst, apparently a former legionary of D&apos;Annunzio. Furst is without a passport, the American authorities at Trieste having impounded it to punish him for joining D&apos;Annunzio. With a view to securing his eventual expulsion, the police are watching Furst, who is a student at the Rome University, and has means of his own.The propaganda supplied to the Italian press by Gavan Duffy is reported to be headed &quot; Agency for Irish Information &quot;, a heading which the press is asked to suppress. The source is usually given as London. Duffy is appearing more in public, and has been in touch with diplomatic representatives accredited to the Vatican. He has been trying to fiiul premises for a permanent establishment.The police would appear to be by uo means delighted at Signor Giolitti&apos;s decision that the restrictions imposed during the war upon aliens in Italy should at length be withdrawn. It was difficult enough to control undesirables with things as they were ; the police say that it has now become impossible, and that it will be no fault of their&apos;s if every kind of undesirable alien makes Italy his happy hunting ground. The police still hope for some kind of compromise.SPAIN.The situation in Barcelona continues grave, and anarchist outrages are constantly reported. On June 30th four bombs were thrown among dense traffic in the centre of the town, wounding 12 persons.The Belgian authorities have received information that the &quot; Con-federacion Regional del Trabajo de Catahina,&quot; a body affiliated to the Third International, employs five men as couriers between Spain and various European countries. One, Jose Gil, believed to be identical with an individual who was sent to Portugal as propagandist, appears to have left Autwerp for London during May.The Juntas de Defensa have passed a vote of confidence in the Government. They agree that a modified form of Syndicalism should be legalised, but will take no steps in that direction until September. The Government will meanwhile be given a free hand to try to settle matters iu its own way. The Government does not officially recognise the Juntas, but has offered them a subvention which has been refused, the Juntas wishing to retain complete liberty of action.PORTUGAL.Inquiries have discovered no trace in Portugal of the so-called &quot; Union of Unemployed.&quot;The French &quot; Clarte&quot; group has entered into relations with an intellectual Communist group in Lisbon, which is to call itself the &quot; Seara Nova &quot;or &quot; New Harvest.&quot; The president of the Lisbon group is Jayme Cortisao, Director of the Lisbon Library ; another leading member is Mario Ribeiro, a novelist of anarchical tendencies.
2. SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES.NORWAY. The Failure of the General Strike.As was stated in the Review for May the general strike, engineered as a sympathetic strike for the seamen, collapsed after lasting for a fortnight. The seamen and their original supporters, the Harbour Transport Workers, remained out during negotiations instituted by the Government, and the Christiana Municipal Workers also remained out on a special dispute of their own arising out of the strike. There has been a serious slump in Moscow shares, and revolutionary speakers are keeping Moscow out of their mouths as much as possible. Signs of revolt against the domination of Moscow have become apparent among the rank and file. The fact that the railways wero not in it weakened the movement considerably, and the efficient work of the Volunteer Corps of citizen workers brought home to labour that Society is not helpless without it. This body, the &quot; Sarnfundshjaelp &quot; or Citizens&apos; Volunteer Working Corps, which probably numbers between 7,000 and 10,000 members in Christiania, did steady excellent work, with little interference from the strikers. Bread, which was at first lacking, was afterwards baked by members of the Corps to an extent not very mnch below the normal supply.There was never much real enthusiasm among the workmen in general for a strike, and the almost desperate conditions of Norwegian industry gives little ground for expectation that the present scale of wages can be maintained.The outstanding figure on the strikers&apos; side was undoubtedly Martin Tranmael. Tranmael is a fanatic idealist, of simple life and real devotion to what he conceives to be the interest of the masses, who trust him and listen to him. &quot; Social Demokraten&quot; since he took over his editorship, has become a force to be reckoned with, whatever exception may be taken to Tranmael&apos;s weapons of exaggeration or falsehood. It is not forgotten that he stayed at his post when other leaders slipped off to Moscow. The revolutionary movement will, suffer a severe blow should Tranmael be imprisoned as a result of the case against &quot; Social Demokraten.&quot;The Lessons o! the Strike  or Labour.There was little doubt from the beginning that Folkets Hus intended the strike to take a revolutionary turn. Its revolutionary enthusiasm was, however, damped by proofs that the &quot; Reds &quot; could not or would not stand up to the police. The leaders are likely to remain in office, owing to the remarkable discipline, patience, and reluctance to take drastic action for themselves that characterises Norwegian Labour, the rank and file of whom seem hardly to have realised as yet that they have been little more than paw us in the revolutionary game.The strike may perhaps be most accurately described as a revo-revolutionary &quot; Trial Mobilisation&quot; which was given the appearance of a &quot;wage movement.&quot; The object was apparently to find out if, and to what extent, the old Socialists could be persuaded to listen to signals from Moscow, with the result that all these people, not without local hesitations, answered the call. The revolutionaries know now how mobilisation is effected, the general plans for the disposition of the forces, and the organisation and functions of the &quot; Samfundshjiilpen.&quot; From a Communist point of view the results are more than satisfactory, as the
revolutionaries now know who are with them and who are against them. It is suggested that the real revolutionary coup will come in the autumn  in November. The strike leaders, during the arbitration negotiations, proposed that no reduction of wages should be carried through before October 1st. It will be. possible to find another reason for a final and decisive fight with the community.The Aftermath.The leaders may claim &quot;victory,&quot; in so far as they have learned their own and their opponents&apos; strength and weakness, and have seen their dupes return to work in a mood of bitterness and disappointment, which mood at present accuses the strike-breaking middle class rather than the leaders. Widespread class hatred now exists, and this, care-fully fostered and strengthened by the growth of unemployment, may grow dangerously.The Future Policy of Folkets Hus.It is realised that unless large quantities of arms are obtained and the Army and Navy undermined, any attempt at revolution may fail. There is no doubt that great efforts will be made to obtain arms, locally or by importation, and to persuade the workers that armed force alone prevents their obtaining their just demands, and that equivalent arma-ment is their only reply. It is stated that the smuggling of arms will be attempted both from Russia via Murmansk and from Germany. The liquor smuggling craft, which have been attempting illicit traffic along the Norwegian coast, may be used. Fights between the smugglers and the patrol boats will give &quot; useful practical training.&quot;The Revolution Committee has also decided to start a regular system of secret intelligence and other agents. The general idea is to make the nation totally dependent upon labour, firstly by introducing disloyal elements into the ranks of the &apos;&apos; Samfundshjaelp &quot; (Society Aid Corps) and other emergency organisations, and secondly by making it impossible, through sabotage, for volunteers to take over the services which labour has abandoned. The foreign press is to be influenced in favour of the Norwegian Labour Movement.The N.L.P. has worked its &quot;lags&quot; or small Communistic groups into several important branches of State and other functionaries ; the Post office, the army, and the press. The Party is thus treacherously supplied with information.Committees of Action (Aktionslag) within the organisations and groups affiliated with the N.L.P., are said to be rapidly increasing in numbers. They have ample funds. Their tasks are illegal activities, workshop sabotage, spying and employment as &quot; stormtroops &quot; in troubles or revolution and as instruments of terror and agents provocateurs. Each &quot; lag &quot; has between 10 and 15 members ; 10 &quot; lags &quot; form a group, and 100 a district council. The Christiania district council would appear to be practically complete. The work of the various &quot; lags,&quot; which aims at the seizure and control of power, is carefully defined.Norway and the Swedish Plot.The only important link between Norway and the Bolshevik plot in Sweden is to be found in the man Heimo alias Fried, who is under arrest at Trondhjem, and who has proved to be one of the most important figures in the affair. He had charge of the Soviet revolutionary bureau, and gave instructions to Norwegian revolutionaries on their visits to Stock-holm. Reports as to the excellent co-operation between the Norwegian
and the Swedish police rogarding Bolshevist schemes in Scandinavia are alleged to bo only diplomatic fiction.Delegates to the Red International.Olav Scheflo, E. Claussen, Sverre Stestad, J.akob Priis, C. 0. Carlseu, Jeanette Olsen, Professor Edv. Bull, Harry Nilsen, aud Arvid Hansen were the Norwegian delegates to the Congress of the Third Inter-national. A committee of loaders was appointed to carry out the duties of the absentees. There are rumours that Scheflo, after leaving, returned surreptitiously to Christiania.Miscellaneous.The Russian Commercial Delegation has arrived in Norway and will be allowed to remain a short time in order to buy material for fisheries.It is denied that Bcla Kun has been in Christiania, though he did in fact wish to come. He was told that he would be welcome as a private visitor, with a strong hint that Folkets Hus did not want his guidance in running the general strike and its possible revolutionary development.The Norwegian Post Office believes that the gold consigned to America by the s.s. &quot; United States &quot; was sent by registered mail from Stockholm direct. Certificates for the gold on certain later steamers were apparently executed in Stockholm, but the bars were stamped in Christiania by the Norwegian assayer.SWEDEN. Discovery of a Bolshevik Plot.Three Finnish and two Swedish subjects were arrested on June 8th in Stockholm, on a charge of attempting to subvert the constitution by violent means. Other arrests are reported to have followed. The compromising documents seized in the apartment of one of the arrested persons, V. Jakobsson-Heikinen, included plans for military espionage and secret political information, as well as information regarding Swedish military establishments and submarines, and orders for the supply of maps and charts to Petrograd. A widespread plot is indicated for a Red revolt in Sweden. Norway, and Finland, and, generally speaking, for the formation of a Federative Soviet state of the northern parts of Sweden, Norway&apos;, and Finland. It is stated in strict confidence that one document seized was a plan for revolution in Sweden and Norway, apparently drawn up by the Deutsche Rev. (Revolutionary ?) Kamp-fleitung. The Communist leader, Niemi, of Kiruna, has been arrested and brought to Stockholm. Niemi is a Swedish subject, who has for some time been observed by the Secret Service.Moscow has realised that Sweden is deaf to propaganda, and that England and Germany are not interested in the world revolution. A plot has therefore been conceived to encircle England and Germany, starting from India, and going through Russia, Finland, aud Norway. Moscow considered that a simultaneous revolution in Finland and Norway would by virtue of its strength effect the conquest of Sweden and Denmark. The capture of the Narvik-Boden-Haparanda railway line was decided upon, so as to establish a free line of communication between Finland and Norway. This line runs through the Kiruua district, where much agitation has been carried on. Details of organisation were left to Niemi, who had practically completed his organisation of secret arms and ammunition depots along the line ; the signal for operations was to come from Finland once preparations were complete.
A chain of arms and ammunition depots appears to have been placed along the Swedish and Norwegian frontiers, but those have little strategic value, save in the event of a successful Norwegian-Finnish coup. The arrest of Niemi has been followed by further arrests, and the expulsion of Wallenius, chief of the Stockholm organisation, as a specially-dangerous individual, has been decided upon by the State Council. The raids in the North have been followed by a flight of many Communists to the coast.Kerjentseff and the Plot.It appears to have been decided to send a special messenger by motor boat to deliver a warning to the Swedish Communists attending the Third International in Moscow. This means is said to have been adopted because the ordinary post was unsafe, and because Kerjentseff, who was applied to with regard to sending cypher messages by telegraph, enlarged upon the unwisdom of such a procedure, saying that he feared his codes were compromised. KerjeiusefTs reluctance was resented by the Communists, who thought he wished to retreat when trouble was brewing. Kerjentseff is believed to have had much to do with the plot in that he was supplying the funds. The revolution had been settled for the autumn, and the first point to be taken was the Boden fort. The Russians had promised to back up operations with 500,000 picked men. There is said to be a certain amount of evidence against Ker-jeutseff, though another report denies this, aud strong representations are being made to the Cabinet to have him and his mission removed from the country. The matter hangs in the balance, but the plot and the precarious financial state of the mission may have the desired effect. In any case, the prospects of a Scandinavian revolution are said to have been destroyed.Communist and Extremist Movements.Though the Government refused passports to Russia to Strom, Hoglund, and other Communists, they have nevertheless all gone. The difficulty was evaded by the obtaining of passports to Esthonia, whence these men will go to Russia without the Swedish endorsement. They meant to attend the Congress of the Third International.Numerous secessions from the Communist Party to Vennerstrom&apos;s Moderate Party are reported. It is noteworthy that these secessions have taken place on a large scale in the extreme north of Sweden. Financial difficulties have meanwhile brought about the stoppage of the Communist paper &quot;Vastmanland,&quot; aud the &quot; Vasterbotteus Folkbad,&quot; the Communist organ in the province of Vlisterbotten, has passed into the hands of the Vennerstrom party.No propaganda schools exist at present in Stockholm, but the Swedish Communist Party has received and accepted an offer from the German Communist Party to send 18 German instructors to Sweden in June and to receive a certain number of Swedish students in Berlin.A Society of Soldiers and Workers, controlled by a soldiers&apos; and workers&apos; council and affiliated to the Swedish Communist Party, is said to exist in Sweden. There is, however, no general communistic feeling among Swedish soldiers and sailors. This was not the case during the war, when a strong current of revolutionary ideas was noticeable. The men of the forces do not appear to relish following the footsteps of Russia. Recent propaganda includes the distribution to conscripts of a pamphlet addressed to &quot;Our Class Brothers in Uniform,&quot; and appealing for the creation of a Red Army.   No serious results are expected,,     O 15382 B
though a certain amount of unrest exists among tho newly-joined conscripts.A sudden considerable increase of the activities of the .I.W.W. is reported. The Stockholm secretary of the society is one C. G, Anders-son ; the local organiser of the Stockholm branch is one Goorgc Clarence, who was 15 years in America, and is paid for organising in Sweden by the I.W.W. Both Andersson and Clarence give most of their time to propaganda work amongst sailors^ Andersson had proposed to attend the Congress of the Third International, but was refused a passport. It was indicated that he might attempt to go without one.The Difficulties of the Bolshevik Delegation.Shortage of funds continues to embarrass the Bolshevik Delegation. The difficulties with the Ekonomibolagat, recently referred to, were finally got over by Klishko sending the necessary money from London. A message sent to Tchitcherin on May 31st stated that ,the representa-tive of the Commissariat for Foreign Trade in Sweden had not received funds for current expenses, and asked that 250,000 Swedish kroner might be immediately transmitted.Trade with Russia.The Soviet is reported to be suggesting the conclusion of a trade agreement similar to those which were negotiated with Great Britain and Germany, these being considered more advantageous for the Bol-sheviks than the present Swedish one. The Foreign Commissariat has placed the bulk of the contracts intended for Sweden in foreign countries  probably Great Britain and Germany-and the Bolsheviks have even considered cancelling old contracts.The Swedish concession recently referred to by Krassin appears to be au agreement of 40 years with the Swedish Ballbearing Company. The company before the war had large factories in Russia. It will be allowed to continue its operations, but after the 40 years have elapsed the plant will become Soviet property.A Swedish Match Trust is said to have been offered the monopoly of match manufacture in Russia, under Swedish management and with Swedish machinery.   A delegation has left for Moscow to negotiate.Lomouosoff has reported that the remelted gold bearing the Swedish stamp has been sold in America for 64 dollars without let or hindrance. Krassin has recommended Tchitcherin to make the greatest use possible of this.The Government and Chattopadhyaya.Chattopadhyaya has been refused permission to re-enter Sweden after a visit to Berlin. The Prime Minister has stated that the object of Chattopadhyaya&apos;s stay in Sweden was to carry on propaganda for the separation of India from the British Empire. He had broken his promises to discontinue his activities, and had previously served 2\ years&apos; imprisonment for being concerned in an anarchist bomb plot. He had also been to Moscow Answering a question in the Riksdag, the Prime Minister said that the Government did not intend to abolish the right of asylum, but they demanded that foreigners enjoying that right should not take part in plots against Sweden or make her territory the base for plots against another country.Miscellaneous.The number of unemployed has risen to 60,000 of whom 15,000 have been given work under the Government scheme.   The unemployment
Commission has asked the Riksdag to grant a further 36,000,000 kr. for carrying on work this year and next. The Government is much alarmed at the magnitude of the sum demanded, which may, iu fact, be far exceeded.Rumours are afloat in Stockholm that a German combine, with Stinnes in the background, is negotiating the taking over of one of the principal electrical works, the Luth and Rosen, which will be operated with German capital.An organisation called the &quot; Community&apos;s Aid&quot; has been formed to protect the public in future labour disputes, and is being well supported by all classes. The success of similar organisations in Denmark and Norway during recent strikes is largely responsible for the move.At its eleventh Congress the Swedish Railwaymen&apos;s Union accepted the proposition put at the Scandinavian Rail way men&apos;s Congress in 1918 regarding permament Scandinavian co-operation and mutual obligations of support between the Scandinavian countries. The members of the Union were forbidden to join the Trades Union Propaganda Association, which has a disruptive effect upon the Unions. The members will vote upon the question of joining the Landsorganisation.DENMARK.The Communist organisation for teachers has passed a resolution binding its members to spread Communism by instructing pupils in Communism and giving them an idea of what it means for the working classes.The Danish delegates to the Congress of the Third International were Poul Gissemann, Ernst Christiansen, Sigvald Hellberg, E. Stenstrup Jensen, Thoger Thogersen, Aage Jorgensen, and Thomas Christensen (from Aarhus).Kerjeutseff is reported to have recently submitted to the Danish Government proposals for a Danish-Russian Commercial treaty on the same lines as the Anglo-Russian agreement. The Government submitted these proposals to Danish financiers for. their comments. A report on the matter is being prepared.3. CENTRAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.HOLLAND. Extremism in the Dutch East Indies.A Communist Chinese schoolteacher, Ching Sien Bie, of Sumatra, has been sentenced to three years&apos; imprisonment on a charge of stirring up revolution by the distribution of Chinese pamphlets. Sneevliet is reported to have reached Vienna on his way to the East, but Avas arrested there and expelled from Austria. The native leaders in the Dutch East Indies appear to be lying low. Has Alimin, the well-knoAvn Sarikat Islam propagandist, has been sentenced to three years&apos; imprisonment on charges of perjury, and inciting other witnesses thereto, in connection with the trial in the &quot; Afdeeling B &quot; revolutionary conspiracy. Thu Sugar Mill Workers&apos; Bond is showing some activity, aimed at obtaining higher wages and shorter hours. Some of the leaders advocate co-operation Avith the Sarikat Islam Society so as to extend the scope of their movement.O  15382 O
GERMANY. The present Aims oii the Communists.Tho Communists ridicule the rumours of an approaching Communist putsch, and describe them as cloaks for Monarchist plots and excuses for delaying disarmament. The Communists dream just nowof the eslablish-ment of a Silesian Soviet Republic, which would serve as a bridge between Russian and German Communism and end the unquiet existence of Poland. Communism would then become a real menace to Western Europe. Moscow, for its part, is said to have urged the enlistment of as many Communists as possible among the irregular German formations in Upper Silesia, where Dr. Hillerson is directing Communist action. The well-known Communist, Krnsny, one time member of tho South Western Commission of the Third International acting in Vienna has been arrested by the Czecho-Slovak Government and handed over to the Pules. Ho was carrying directions from Moscow.Moscow has rebuked the V.K.P.D. because owing to the party crisis, certain members of the Central Committee permitted tho summoning of a Party Congress. It is pointed out that the orders for the fixing of an extraordinary Congress must proceed from Moscow. At this Congress a representative from Moscow will be present. Meanwhile, signs of the rapprochement of the V.K.P.D. and the K.A.P.D. are multiplying. Tho interior fusion would appear to be fairly wrell advanced, and the greatest obstacle to reunion the presence of Paul Levi has been eliminated. Tho Communist germ cells in the Trades Unions have achieved meagre results ; a change of tactics here on the part of the V.K.P.D. may be anticipated.Policy oi the United Communists.The United Communist Party seems to meditate a change of policy. The tone of its circulars has changed, and now talks of the distinction to be made between the final and the immediate aims of a revolt, so that a rising which fails may be written down as a matter of purely local importance. The immediate aims&quot; outlined are : opposition to war agitation, increased assistance for the unemployed, opposition to wage reductions, and to special laws aud regulations directed against Communist workmen : and endeavours to brinsc about the release of political prisoners and the disarmament of all bourgeois and reactionary organisations.The Party has circulated a pamphlet dealing with the work and organisation of the Party. The various groups are minutely sub-divided, fining down, in accordance with Communist practice, to groups of ten members. Every member of these groups has his appointed activities. He has one or more houses to deal with, and to discover sympathisers with Communism, or counter-revolutionaries, with the degree of their respective sympathies. He must know which side every man he knows will take up in the coming struggle.Levi&apos;s New Organisation.Levi has now set up a rival organisation to the Communist Party. A general movement away from the United Communist Party has been in progress since the collapse of the March rising. In Greater Berlin the membership of this party has declined from 35,000 to 20,000. In many factories half the members of the Communist Party have joined the Independent Socialists. 500 Communist Party officials have been dismissed by various Hamburg factory managements without any opposi-tion from the workmen.  The party organisation has collapsed in Central
Germany. Lovfs published material goes to show that the March &quot; putsch &quot; was not provoked by the Saxon authorities and especially by President Horsing, but that it had been long preparing.The Position in the Provinces.Out of a population in the Rhine area of over 7,000,000 persons, only 20,000 are reported to be Communists, and the Communism of most of these docs not go beyond their voting papers. The actual number of those who are ready to suffer for their Communistic faith is much smaller. The youths&apos; and men&apos;s movements are also poorly supported, In general, Berlin is greatly dissatisfied with the middle-Rhine area, the most retrograde in the whole of Germany. An intelligence service, joined with more intense propaganda work in factories and industrial under-takings, mainly distinguishes the new Communist organisation. Apart from its primary object of spying on reactionary organisations aiid collecting material respecting working conditions and unemployment the intelligence service Avill probably develop in occupied territory into a fairly big illegal organisation, working in secret until the last moment.The Hamburg representatives of the United Communist Party, together with representatives of the Syndicalist General Workers&apos; Union, are said to have met secretly at the end of May, in order to discuss a proposal of the Central Executive of. the United Communist Party in Berlin that the Hamburg Executive should prepare for further disturbances. The meeting had no result. The Workers&apos; Union declined collaboration with the Communists, and suggested that the Central Executive, as a prclim-inary to action, should ascertain the feeling of the workers. Revolutionary action in Hamburg is only possible in conjunction with the General Workers&apos; Union, which is chastened by the failure of the last Putsch. The Hamburg Geueral Workers&apos; Union, a strong organisation, numbers 12,000 members and recently absorbed the Hamburg group of the Communists Workers&apos; Party.Little importance is attached locally to reports that the Essen Branch of the Metal Workers&apos; Union has decided to join the Third International. Krupps themselves are not disposed to pay any attention to the decision. The present international situation would seem more likely to provoke a working-class movement away from Communism towards Nationalism.Communism: A Miscellany.Berlin papers were saying at the beginning of June that the Soviet had sent 5,000,000 marks to Germany, inviting the Communists to try their luck ajrain.Otto Brass, the Communist leader, is reported to have taken over large sums of money on the occasion of his recent visit to Moscow.Walcher and Fritz Riick, of the Berlin Communist Central Bureau, are reported to have gone to Russia to attend the Moscow Meeting. Walcher is to report on Kopp&apos;s activities, which the Executive Com-mittee considers to be very unsuccessful, in spite of the considerable amount of money which he has spent.Report has it that the propaganda department of the Western European Secretariat in Berlin has decided to demand from Moscow complete independence from the Soviet Delegation in Germany, and complete freedom of action. The events of March 1st proved that unco-ordiuated leadership is fatal to that movement.Communist propaganda, consisting of extracts from the French Press, has been increasingly circulated since French troops came into the. British area.   The French troops, especially the Alsatians, are aimed at.0 2
Iu the &quot; Role Fahne&quot; of Juno 26th the United Communist Party published an inflammatory proclamation calling upon the German miners to show their solidarity with the British miners, by calling a sympathetic strike of at least two days&apos; duration, and thus redeeming the Gorman workers from the scandal of international strike breaking. Transport workers and railwaymen were called upon to prevent the transport of German coal to England.The trial of Max Holz, the Communist Chieftain, on charges of murder and high treason ended in a sentence of penal servitude for life. An intended Communist manifestation was forbidden by the police.However low they had set their hopes, the organisers of ati inter-national meeting of juvenile organisations, convoked by the V.K.P.D., which took place at Stuttgart during May, were disappointed. Few juveniles attended and comrades from abroad kept away. Fran Rosa Block, who represented Switzerland, lamented her passport difficulties, and explained that the passport control in Switzerland is a great hindrance to the revolutionary movement.Relations with Russia-Political.The real aims of the Soviet Delegation Avere revealed at a meeting Avhich recently took plaoe in the political section. The trade agreement Avas discussed, Scheinmann arguing that propaganda could be developed without any fear of control if numerous sections and subsections of the Third International Avere opened under the guise of various business offices. Propaganda Avould thus be furthered, not in Germany only, but in the Avhole of Western Europe. An urgent communication from Moscow suggested the desirability of utilising, oAving to the critical situation in Germany, the political moment for propaganda among the Left Wing of the Independent Socialist Party in order to unite Avith the Communists, and together Avith the latter prepare a neAV rising.On the other side, certain Russians competent to speak, declare that Germany has entered into an agreement with the Bolsheviks in order to seize such present advantages as she can. She has used these advantages principally to penetrate Russia and consolidate her position there in good time, but she has at the same time got control of the anti-Bolshevik organisations which she thinks will be important in the future. German agents in Russia use all private means to help the people acainst Com-munist oppression, and are rewarded by the gratitude and confidence of the population. It is suggested that England might improve her position in Russia, and overcome the distrust Avhich is alleged to be unfortunately prevalent among Russian emigres, by making clear Avhat she has done iu the past for Russia, and her reasons for entering into the trade agreement, and by helping the Russian emigrant owners, not by buying them out, but by advancing them loans on their properties.Moscoav has sent its Berlin delegation a detailed scheme regarding the formation of neAV peasant colonies in Russia. German peasants can settle in Russia and receive a further grant of land for agricultural purposes, together with full religious and cultural liberty on condition that they acknoAvledge Soviet laws, undertake to abstain from national or German propaganda, bind themselves to remain at least five years in Russia, and bring agricultural machinery and implements, also live stock and some household equipment.Russian Personnel in Germany.Lutovinoff in Berlin has informed Tchitcherin that the German Government considers the Soviet representatives only as a delegation dealing with matters concerning prisoners of war, because the Soviet
government has not given the German Government even the name of the temporary chief of the delegation, which is being constituted in accordance with the recent agreement. The necessary declarations and the sending of credentials are absolutely essential to any accomplishment of the agreement.During his stay in Berlin Krassin discussed the question of German diplomatic representation in Russia. Dr. Rosen proposed three candi-dates : Dr. Adolph Koster, Dr. Sudekum, and Dr. Nadolny, German Minister at Stockholm. Krassin talked of Soviet preference for a member of a bourgeois or noble family as German representative, in preference to a Social Democrat, and asked Dr. Rosen to put forward a few more candidates for submission to the Sovnarkom.It is reported that efforts have been made to induce the Foreign Office to deport Reich as an undesirable alien, but that the chief of the Berlin police has refused to take action in the absence of authentic proof of illegal acts. Reich and Broido have been instructed by Zinovieff to do all in their power to remain in Germany. They are being helped by the local Left Poale Ziou and Jewish Bund, who argue that as they have been dismissed from the Soviet Delegation, they cannot do any harm in Germany. It should, however, be remembered that Reich and Broido have been given posts under the Third International. The pair have induced the Berlin group of the Russian Social Democratic Party to bear witness to their good faith.A Jew named Stepanov, speaking excellent German, French, and English has arrived in Berlin, where he will be chief of the Intelligence Service of the Soviet Delegation. Stepanov has been employed in the Extraordinary Committee, and was once Commissar of one of the Soviet armies.The Soviet is said to have at Frankfort an important agent named Stockel, a solicitor, who directs the Communist movement in the Ruhr region with agents of lesser importance at Wiesbaden.The suggested re-organisation of the courier service between Germany and Russia provides for six couriers, treated as diplomatic couriers on the basis of reciprocity. The permanent couriers and their official documents properly sealed and addressed are exempted from search, but the docu-mentsmust not exceed 15 kg. in weight.Relations with Russia : Commercial.It is said that little credibility attaches to reports of trading trans-actions, which are made for propaganda purposes. It rarely happens that the Russian representatives in Reval carry out a contract signed with private individuals, and the Reval Law Courts are overwhelmed with claims against them. A swarm of Bolshevik commercial agents has decended upon Berlin. These people have engaged in pourparlers ostensibly for the purpose of trade, really in order to create jealousy between various financial and merchantile circles. The Germans have no delusions left, as the detailed reports which they have received from Russia, emphasise that the Bolsheviks possess neither goods nor&apos; money.Krestinski&apos;s negotiations with the Bleicbroder Bank in Berlin for a loan to the Soviet Government have not yet materialised owing to the unacceptable guarantees demanded in gold and foreign securities. Krestinski, is, however, unwilling foreknowledge himself beaten.
Krassin is reported to have instructed Lomonosoff and StomaniakoH&apos; to continue negotiations with such leaders of German industry as Stinnes, the A-llgeineine Elektrizitats Gesellchaft, and Siomens and Sehuekert. IPrivate inquiries have been made, directed towards discovering whether the big German financial aud industrial concerns would like to come into the ltusso-Asiatic Consolidated Company and bring in some new capital for the purpose of restoring the Siberian mines belonging to the company. Max Warburg, the Stinnes group, and Krupp&apos;s concerns were approached. Opinion generally was favourable, but the financial problems besetting Germany were insisted upon. The head of Krupps, Herr Wiedfeldt, thought it very desirable that&apos;tho big industrial concerns such as Krupps should come to a working arrangement with British firms almost immediately as the only way of avoiding further industrial depression. From an international point of view Herr Wied-feldt was almost certain that every case against the Bolsheviks would be much stronger if there was mutual international interest. The big German manufacturers would appear for the present to be more pro-British than pro-American ; the bankers and financial magnates are pro-American.It is reported that a new limited company, called the German-Russian Transport Company, has been formed in Berlin to undertake the transport of German goods to Russia by land and by sea. The Hamburg-Amerika line will hold half the share capital but will have no monopoly of the business. The Soviet guarantees to the company an absolute monopoly, and will accept imports from Germany only if imported by the company. The main hope of the Soviet in supporting this new undertaking is that food may be imported from abroad for the starving population of Petrograd.A new Russo-german undertaking called the &quot; International Trading Company for the East&quot; has been established in Berlin, with the object of facilitating German trade with Soviet Russia and the Ukraine. This concern has bought the Disconto Banking Company, the capital of which is to be increased to 25,000,000 marks. The Foreign Trade Company of Berlin is reported to have established a branch at Reval, which is in business relations with Russia. A Border States Joint Stock Company has also been formed in Reval for the purpose of trading with Russia.The Tentacles of Hugo Stinnes.The growing aggressiveness of Stinnes is by no means passively accepted; indeed a movement is on foot for crushing the Stinnes group both politically and economically. Erzberger is the power behind Stinnes&apos; political opponents, who are in relations with the Government, through the medium of Dr. Ilemmer, private secretary to Dr. Wirth. Activities on the economic side centre round the iron firm of Ottoman, Strauss, and Wolff. The politicians seek to push Stinnes into the arms of the People&apos;s Party, with a view to splitting that party into a Stresemann-KardorfF and a von Lersner-Stinnes group; the economists seek primarily to eliminate Stinnes&apos; interests in the work of reconstruction in France. The opponents of Stinnes have to their credit the frustration of the participation of the Stiuuos group in the Hsimburg-Amerika line, and the prevention of the establishment of relations between Stiunes and the Skoda works in Czeeho-Slovakia. The promoters of the campaign, which is as yet very young, believe that, they can crush Stinnes in the course of the next five years.Stinnes&apos; attempts to buy certain Swiss newspapers, mentioned in the Review for May, seem to have had little result. The only paper over which be has gained any effective control is the &quot; Zjuricher Post.&quot;
Stinnes has bought about half the shares of this paper, and is trying privately to buy further shares, an attempt in which he is unlikely to succeed for the time being. He holds shares, too few to give him any serious influence, in the &quot;National Zeitung&quot; of Basle and the &quot; Berner Tageblatt&quot; of Berne.In Austria Stinnes is said to have recently made an unsuccessful attempt to buy the Vienna newspaper &quot; Deutsche Volksblatt&quot; and^to combine it with the &quot; Deutsch Oesterreiches Tageblatt&quot; into an enter-prise rivalling the &quot;Neues Wiener Tagblatt.&quot; Circles in Muuich which oppose Stinnes&apos; designs in Austria, frustrated this attempt. Further cast the Rumanian independent newspaper &quot; Dacia,&quot; which was ostensibly bought by Marghilomau&apos;s Banca Natiuuei, is said to have been in reality acquired by agents of Stinnes, but it is not at present to betray its change of ownership. The steadiness of the shares of the Banca Natiunei, in the face of rumoured difficulties, is attributed to the support of Stinnes, in return for underhand work on his behalf.Stinnes is reported to contemplate the building of 40 additional steamers, though his shipping investments are losing him large sums of money. He recoups himself, however, from other sources. Stinnes has opened an agency in Stockholm, at present occupied in exporting iron ore from Scandinavia to Stinnes&apos; works iu Germany, where it is becoming railway material for Russia.Financial circles in Budapest are rumouring that Stinnes intends buying the majority of shares in a number of Hungarian iron and steel works, notably those of Rima Murany, Woerner, Schlick, and Ganz Danubius.Oriental Intrigues.There is confirmation of the report that Bomanji is contributing to the non-co-operation movement in India. He is negotiating with Stinnes for advancing the scheme for boycotting English goods and establishing direct commercial relationship between Germany and India.B. N. Dutt, Chattopadhyaya, and Nalini Gupta, are said to have left Berlin for Russia. Dr. Hafis was to travel to Moscow under a diplomatic passport granted him by the Afghan Delegation.It is suggested that S, N. Kar, who has been invited to go to Stockholm or Berlin as soon as possible, will probably replace Dutt as head of the Indian Executive Committee in Berlin. One Louis P. Lochner, otherwise Lockmann, representative of the American Federated Press in Germany, which is connected with the Rosta Agency, is to be used iu his capacity as a journalist, as a courier for Chatto and other members of the Indian Committee. Lochner was secretary to Ford at the time of the Peace Conference, and is a well-known American pacifist and extreme Socialist.The present Afghan Ambassador in Berlin, who is said to know no European language, is on friendly terms with the members of the Berlin Indian Committee, who are training him in the way he should go. The extremists hope that this friendship may end in the appointment of some of their members as Afghan representatives in European capitals, with a consequent diminished risk to their activities.Miscellaneous.It was reported from Berlin at the beginning of May that a certain Rakitnikov had arrived in Munchen from Moscow in order to open negotiations with the Orgesch^ The subject of these negotiations is kept very secret.
Mrs. Roland-Hoist has left for Russia, crossing the German frontlet&apos; without a visa. In spite of their promises, the Germans did not try to prevent her from travelling across Germany, although they had every opportunity of sending her back to Holland.Au unconfirmed report states that Steklov-Nahamke^ daughter, known by the name of Georgesco, has passed through Berlin on her way to Paris accompanied by a Jew, Leo Hausper. The couple had with them large sums of money and jewellery, and many letters for foreign members of the Third International.A Russian woman named G. Shapira holds tho post of reader of reports in the News Department of the &quot; Institut fur Weltwirtsohaft mid Seeverkehr,&quot; which is attached to the University of Kiel. The News Department has for object to help the development of German foreign trade ; its activities are journalistic. Shapira works at England and her colonies, and would appear to be seeking u post with the Russian Trade Delegation in London.SWITZERLAND.Sinn Fein Propaganda.A Swiss pro-Irish Committee has been established&apos; under the tem-porary direction of Wolhauscr, Sury dApremont, and H. Ungcr, Fribourg remains the provisional centre ; the secretariat is at Zurich. Directions are to be received at Fribourg from Brussels and not from Paris. An Irish delegate is about to arrive in Switzerland, either from Brussels or from Rome. The Press Bureau at Fribourg for news from Ireland would appear to receive a monthly subsidy of 2,300 Swiss francs, of which Rome contributes 1,300 and Brussels the remainder. Five thousand francs monthly is available in addition for such branches of Irish propaganda as the publication and distribution of pamphlets. Arrangements are going forward for a pro-Irish demonstration, and the Pro-Irish Committee hope to secure forty to sixty thousand signatures to a resolution of sympathy with Ireland.Relation of Esperanto with Communism.Esperanto plays a disquieting part iu Communist propaganda and in the international revolutionary movement. The Russian Government has introduced the language into all schools, and has created a special commission to consider the employment of &quot; Ido &quot; (a perfected Esperanto) in the international relations of the Soviet. Geneva is the headquarters of the International Esperanto Association and the Director of the Association is Edmond private, a Socialist journalist, who is in corres-pondence with Lunacharsky. The Association is not officially engaged in politics, but it has close relations with the Russian Communists and with the militant revolutionary organizations of the world.Miscellaneous.A Communist meeting held at Lausanne during May discussed questions of propaganda and action in France and Italy.It is reported that the &quot; Sojus Soviet&quot; of Switzerland addressed itself to Krassin with a proposal to submit to him a project for a trade agreement between Switzerland and Russia. The leaders of this campaign were to go to Berlin.The diminishing importance which has of late marked Egyptian affairs in Switzerland, will be accentuated by the departure for Egypt of Yussuf Pasha Saddik, Abdul Hamid Shedid Bey, and Fuad Selim Bey.   Yussuf has stated that he goes to Egypt mainly in order to bring
about aii understanding between Adli Pasha and Zaglotil. Turks and Egyptians in Switzerland are not on good terms.AUSTRIA. The Crisis in the Communist Party.The Austrian Communist Party is reported to have about 15,000 paying members, each of them contributing 4 kr. monthly. The members of the Central Committee are paid 12,000 kr. monthly, and monthly current expenses amount to about 2,000,000 kr. The various party organisations are run at a heavy loss, but the deficiency has hitherto been met by Russian money and jewels. On May 31st the Financial Secretary, Fran Lohner, received 500,000 kr. for the party. The great question facing the Communists is to decide the division of the party funds if the two parties definitely split.The lack of money is so serious that Bronski-Warschavski has been in Berlin on a money-begging mission for his Legation in Vienna. The support of the Hungarian and Ukrainian Communists is a heavy financial burden, and Bolshevik propaganda in Austria cannot be maintained without further financial support. Although the results of Soviet propaganda bear no proportion to the amount of money expended Krassin granted Bronski 3,000,000 Austrian kroner.The internal crisis in the party is severe. The defection of the Levites under Schmeral and Strasser has weakened it, and the leaders who remain theoretically true to the advanced party lie under suspicion of lukewarmness and lack of integrity in money matters. Bronski-Warschawski is negotiating with the leaders, whom he accuses of paying 95 per cent, of their personal expenses out of party funds. Tomann, Frey, and Glass are to answer on this count before a special court of inquiry, which is also to deal with the attitude of the leaders towards the split. Bela Kim and Sinowjew have retired from the leadership of the Austrian section of the Moscow Soviet on account of Austrian Jack of activity and misapplication of the money sent from Moscow. Moscow means to pay increased attention to Austria, and insists on au exact account of the situation and of the Levi split. In order to overcome the inadequacy of its communications with Austria, Moscow is said to have determined to establish in Vienna a company known as &quot;Steinmann, G.m.b.H.,&quot; which is to act as cover for a Soviet information service in Vienna, and for a courier service between Moscow and Central Europe, particularly Austria and Czecho-Slovakia. Count SchafFgotsch, who is in the full confidence of Lenin, directs the company, working under the assumed name of Hans Volker.Korttschoner and Dr. Frey went to the conference at Moscow as official representatives of the Austrian Communists. Strasser and Stromer (a woman) went unofficially, but with full guarantees of security as representing the Levites. Radek was expected in Vienna after the congress.Remedial Measures.Efforts at mitigating the party crisis are ardent, and a noticeable tightening of discipline and inner mechanism is showing itself. Quality and not quantity is aimed at; many-members have been expelled for slackness. The Germ Cells and Fractions have been appointed a &quot; revolutionary opposition &quot; and more trained leaders and functionaries have been formed. The Party believes that, though its numbers are small, the pressure of economic conditions will bring it to its ends.
KarFs escapade was used lo exploit the irritation of the Socialists to Communist purposes. The permeation of the Trade Unions progresses, and Communist influence, working against reconciliation, is manifest in many strikes. In recent strikes on the electric lines in Salzburg and among the industrial employees in Upper Austria, Communist intrigues were not successful ; on the other hand they are playing an important part in the miners&apos; strike in Styria. Work in the Trades Unions and among women is to be intensified and a strong effort is to lie made to win over the intelligentsia. Meanwhile, propaganda literature pours in from Germany. The VVehrmacht show little Communist activity, though literature is distributed in the barracks. There have been many desertions to the Social Democrats, but a disciplined kernel remains.Lower Austrian Communists in Conference.Great fear of the Levites, hick of good leadership, and of trust in the present leaders, and place hunting were the chief impressions left after the conference of the Communists of Lower Austria, which was held in Vienna early in June. Reporting to the Conference, Tomann complained that the Communist Party was not tackling the question of the Socialist &quot; Ordnerwehr &quot; with the activity which it deserved. Social Democrats possessed -10,000,000 kr. worth of hidden arms, ranging from revolvers to heavy pieces, and they were organised on strictly military lines. The Communists, for their part, hardly disposed of an arms depot of five to six million kroner and (heir organisers had absolutely no discipline. Delegates were to arrange for Communists to enter the Social Democrat Ordnerwehren and keep the Communist Soldatenzentrale accurately informed of the situation and the amount of arms and ammunition there. Such men were .to consider themselves, not germ cells, but military intelligence men. More and more Communists must be represented in the Ordnerwehr and enter positions of command, at least the lower ones. Headquarters would deal with the higher command.A heated debate followed ou the question whether the organisation of Vienna was to be separated from that of the provinces. The party leaders, who put the motion, were defeated by 42 votes to 80, and a statute of organisation for the province of Lower Austria was passed. Ahti-Levite resolutions went through for communication to the Austrian Communist Party, and resolutions for the introduction of &quot; Communist Saturdays,&quot; stronger propaganda, &quot; Red Weeks &quot; in Vienna, and better printing for &quot; Rote Palme,&quot; were passed for communication to the Committee of Education.Communists and Trade Unionists.The permeation of the Trades Unions by communism, in accordance with the precepts of Moscow, is very well exemplified in Austria. After 18 months&apos; assiduous work the Trade Union Committee attached to the Austrian Communist Party has succeeded in entrenching Communist mem-bers in the unions. These disciples are first specially trained, and finally form germ cells, which do not in every case immediately reveal their true character. The first National Conference of all Communist Trade Union Fractions of Austria was held during May, and the Trade Union Council of the Austrian Communist Party has now been constituted. Each province of Austria has a Trade Union Committee, each Committee sending one representative to the Viennese Trade Union Council. This Council is thus a National Council, and becomes a competent member of the Red Trades Union International. The Communist workers as a whole form an independent section of the Red International under the
title of Communist Minority of the Austrian Trades Unions. The weekly Viennese paper, &quot; Der Arbeiterrat,&quot; is (he organ of the Communist Trade Unionists.The Hungarian Communists.The Austrian Communist Party is alleged to have found very faithful supporters in the Hungarians driven into exile after tho fall of the Bela Kun regime. These people are well organised in Vienna, and are in constant touch with Hungarian Communists abroad. They are markedly increasing their propaganda activity. Hungarian emigrants form a large proportion of the employees of the Communist Party in the secretariat and bookshop.Poale Zion.The right wing of Poalc Zion in Austria is devoting its attention chiefly to Palestine affairs. A Labour Commission for Emigration to Palestine has been formed, which helps Social Democrat Palestine immigrants during their stay in Vienna. A Palestine Workmen&apos;s Fund has also been founded to help the undertakings of the Jewish proletariat in Palestine. There has been a lively attack on England in connection with the bloodshed at Jaffa on May Day. The Left (Communist) Wing of Poale Zion is considering the changing of its name to &quot;Jewish Communist Workers&apos; Party of Austria &quot; it now calls itself the &quot;Jewish Socialist Workers Party Poale Zion in Austria.&quot; The Party is allied to the International Jewish Socialist Association Poale Zion, and adheres to the Third International. It has formed a separate &quot;Emigrants and Palestine Bureau&quot; to deal with Communist affairs connected with Palestine and to support its members in every way.Stinnes and the Anschluss Campaign.Hugo Stinnes is reported to be aiming at Anschluss on a large scale. Though he has not so far committed himself either to Austria or to Hungary, he appears to dream of uniting both countries to Germany and of turning Vienna into a great commercial centre. Should the union of Austria to Germany fail, Stinnes \\ill seek, in conjunction with the great landed proprietors of West Hungary, to unite Austria with Hungary.In spite of Stinnes&apos; able propaganda, thoughtful circles are not seduced by the Anschluss movement. The Christian Socialists oppose it; the Social Democrats favour it because of their ties with the German Social Democrats ; and the Pan-Germans work for it because they have no other plank in their party programme. Economic despair and dislike and distrust of Germany divide public opinion. It is estimated that a fair plebiscite taken in Austria would certainly not give more than 60 per cent, in favour of Germany. If economic conditions continue desperate, however, sustained Auschluss propaganda in Vienna would probably largely increase this figure.Miscellaneous.The difficulty of proving the charges made against him of defrauding the Czecho-Slovakian Gorernmerit has resulted in the release of Trebitsch Lincoln by the Provincial Courts. Lincoln has been handed over to the Vienna Courts, where he will be charged with using a forged passport. After serving what will probably be a light sentence he will he expelled from Austria.Glass, Gruen and Dr, Friedlaendcr, members of the Executive of the Communist Party, deal with the unemployed question in Austria. The Austrian Communist Party appears to have proposed to allow the
Austrian unemployed to co-operate in the German action, since no separate organisation on the German model could usefully be arranged in Austria. Friedlacnder is attempting to obtain figures of the unemployed, but lie is opposed by the Social Democratic Trade Unions, which desire to solve the unemployed question separately in each Trade Union.The great discontent prevalent in the Wehrmacht is reported to have issued in a number of defections. The depression would seem to be caused by a feeling that the organised workmen as a whole are deserting the Wehrmiinner. The Trade Union representatives are accordingly asking that measures should be taken to stir the workmen to take more interest in securing a decent existence to the Wehruuhmer, thanks to whom the workmen have their demands satisfied. It is pointed out that neglect to do this gives the political opponents of Labour an excuse for dissolving the VVehnnacht.Under the auspices of the Arbeiterwehr, a new organisation has been founded called &quot; Die Wanderer.&quot; It is a secret society, formed of specially reliable workers, and has for main object to counteract the activities of the Ileimwehr. It has no direct contact with the Social Democrat Leaders, and is administered entirely by the Workers&apos; Councils. The objects include the defence of the Republic and its institution and the organisation has nothing to do with the establishment of a Soviet dictatorship. &quot;Die Wanderer&quot; are well armed and are gradually spreading over Carinthia. They are in touch with the Wehrmacht, whoso co-operation has been guaranteed by the Soldiers&apos; Councils.CZECHOSLOVAKIA. The Czech Communists and Moscow.Now Unit it is possible to weigh dispassionately the consequences of the recent adhesion of the Communist faction to the Third Inter-national, it may be conceded that politically the chief result is that negotiations wjll be at once started with a view to an amalgamation of Czech and German Communist Parties. The Moderate or Central Party of the Left will probably form a separate party. The &quot;Centre&quot; group, representing railway workers and sane trades unionism is likely to found a political club directed to the practical interests of Trade Unionists rather than to those of doctrinaire Socialism.Moscow&apos;s view of affairs is expressed in the reported order of the Third International, with regard to future action. Moscow demanded a single Communist organisation, which would place itself on the basis of the Third International, a &quot;United Communist Party of Czecho-Slovakia.&quot; The ,SocialistjS are now expecting delegates from Moscow to discuss the lines of their actions. The Czech Communist Party itself is opposed to Moscow&apos;s orders. Many leaders are against the fusion, which Sineral himself is said not to favour. So strong is national feeling in Czecho-Slovakia that the Communist leaders fear that many members, refusing to join the &quot;International &quot; amalgamation, will leave the party and unite with the German Communists.Smeral, who thinks everything of leadership and nothing of nominal policy, is said by his cleverness to have had much to do with the sudden outward change of policy at the Conference. The propaganda methods used by Moscow and by the Czech Government respectively appear to have had an effect diametrically opposite to that intended. It will be remembered that the German Communist Party of Czecho-Slovakia joined the Third International months ago, and Kreibich, their leader, who dreams of succeeding Smeral, has been trying to dispossess the
latter of his leadership. Snioral seems to have had little difficulty in upsetting Kreibich&apos;s schemes. The Government counter-propaganda, which manufactured faked &quot;directives&quot; by Moscow, insisting on the artificial nature of the Czecho-Slovak State, had the wrong effect, reminding the parly of their probable fate between the German and Magyar Communists if they continued to flout Moscow by refusing to join the Third International. Smeral pointed out that the only way to safeguard national freedom and independence was, however strange it might be, to vote for the Third International and stop any unfair intrigue between Moscow and Kreibich. The result was that, with the exception of seven delegates, the entire party voted for joining the Third International. Czech official circles are highly pleased. Their anticipation, although they did all they could to prevent the Communists from joining Moscow, was that the party might join the Reds as converts or followers, and not, as actually happened, out of spite with a firm intention to thwart Moscow.The recent congress itself would appear to have been packed, and the resolution arrived at entirely misrepresents Moscow&apos;s influence in C/echo-Slovakia. Smeral himself sees as clearly through Moscow as does Paul Levi. One serious result of the congress has been the loss to the Social Democrats of most of their more intelligent adherents. It is doubtful whether their membership exceeds 100,000 members although 300,000 are claimed. Meanwhile the Communist Party intends to send a deputation to Russia to study conditions there, though the Communists are said to have no illusions in regard to these.After a warning from Moscow that a visit would not be healthy for him, Smeral seems at the last moment to have decided not to accompany the deputation to Moscow.Industrial Troubles.It was reported at the end of May that the strike in the &quot;metal industry had extended to nearly all factories. The Government had been unable to secure a compromise over the question of the competence of the Committees of the Workrnen&apos;s Councils in the administration of factories.. The Communists were showing some intention to use the dispute as a pretext for a general revolutionary strike, an attitude unsupported by the majority of the Socialist leaders, who saw that the industrial crisis forbade hopes of victory. The refusal of the workers to allow superfluous Avorkmen to be dismissed brought about the closing of the biggest tanneries in Prague.Ultimately the strike ended in a compromise. The shop stewards will not in future decide the discharge of a worker, but the question will be referred to a commission of seven, three of them appointed by the workers. The economic demands of the workers are reported to have been satisfied. The terms of settlement would, however, appear to satisfy neither workers nor employers, and they are regarded as a truce preliminary to a fresh struggle. One big employer has stated tha^t the masters will attempt the dismissal of the ringleaders of the strike, which action may reopen the quarrel.The Socialists&apos; Programme.800 Czech delegates and a number of Russian Social Revolutionaries. attended the congress of National Socialists held at Whitsuntide. The party decided to call itself the &quot; Socialist party,&quot; and voted for the socialisation of the coal mines and the big industries, the speeding up of Agrarian reform, and the separation of Church and State.   It affirmed
the national nature of its programme ami its intention of collaborating with the parties of lasv and order.Miscellaneous.A Prague report says that German agents are hiring workmen in Slovakia at 16 marks a day with food for reconstruction work in the North of Franco.The Minister of Railways is said to have secretly ordered that all railway employees shall be listed according to their politics. All Com-munists are to be discovered.Dr. Tucek, Director-General of the Skoda Works, is reported to have discussed with Krassin iu Berlin the question of exporting finished products from Czecho-Slovakia to Russia, It is hoped that these negotiations may result in an increase of the hitherto small quantity of exports.Two Czech Missions will shortly go to Russia, one for economic purposes, the other in connection with the repatriation of Czech subjects. The Soviet wishes to send au economic mission of 30 members to Czecho-Slovakia, but the Czech Government objects to so large a number.4. RUSSIA AND THE BORDER STATES. RUSSIA.Social and Economic.A census of the population reveals an uneven increase in the village population and a serious decline in the population of the towns, ranging from 51&apos; 5 per cent, in Petrograd and 44*5 per cent, in Moscow to 1 o * 7 per cent, in Saratov. Among the provincial capitals there is au increase of population only in those towns which have become provincial centres since the Revolution. The census gives a total population of 133,000,000, a decrease of 12,000,000 since 1914. Officials in Moscow number 228,000 against 223,000 for the whole of Russia in 1897.The reviving influence of the Church would appear to be greatly perturbing the Soviet. The &quot; Pravda&quot; roundly demands that Com-munists shall not take part in religious ceremonies and that they shall lay bare the &quot;root of religion.&quot; Responsible workers with religious weaknesses must be either expelled or reduced to &quot; candidates,&quot; and a serious propaganda carried on, especially in the villages. The best known priests are being prosecuted. At Petrograd they are accused of having taken part iu the insurrection at Kronstadt,At the recent Bacteriologist Congress at Moscow, it was reported that pucuuionic plague had penetrated into south-west Russia and that cholera was spreading rapidly in the Central and Southern Governments.The Soviet has decided to introduce a State monopoly of salt.*The Impending Famine.Moscow has been circulating optimistic reports as to the prospects of the harvest, but these have since been so modified as to have become au admission of the failure of the crops. The Soviet credits itself with the intention of taking few or no cattle from the peasants by avay of taxes to feed the cities, so as to allow the live stock to reconstitute itself.A significant light is thrown upon the conditions of famine by the strict orders by which the Soviet is seeking to check unauthorised travelling.   Martial law is to remain in force both on the railways and
the waterways, and unrestricted travelling is only permitted along the high roads. Moscow refers to tho daily increasing number of passengers travelling without tickets along the railways, which has assumed most grave dimensions. The enormous number of citizens travelling to obtain foodstuffs is overcrowding stations aud landing stages (there being over 1(X),000 assembled in the Ukraine) filling trains aud ports and damaging the roiling stock which, as it is, is badly in need of renewal and repair.The Internal Situation.The &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; which is not unaware of the precarious hold of the Soviet regime, was recently preparing its readers for possible developments by stating that it had good reason to believe that another plot was on foot for a White rising in Russia, to take place in August. There are in fact reports that an attempt at a great co-ordinated insur-rection may be expected immediately after the harvest. The Red Army will either join the insurrection or remain inactive. Informants from the interior lay stress on the prevalent disorganisation and internecine strife, anil on the hopeless position of the Soviet Government.The opinion is gaining ground that the Bolsheviks themselves are envisaging the possibility of a near end, which will be precipitated should au open split result from the differences between the right wing (Lenin) of the Government and the left (Bukhariu). No efforts have been able to compose these differences, which have resulted in bitter public quarrels. The last vanishing hope is of world revolution, and the last gold roubles are being spent on propaganda,All the Ukrainian political parties have now coalesced, under French patronage, on the basis of &quot;complete national independence.&quot; There are supporters of a Hetmauate, but Skoropndsky&apos;s candidature has been put aside completely. Few Ukrainians will have anything to do with Skoropudsky. In case of success Galicia will pass to the Ukraine, on condition that the Ukraine and Poland conclude a firm and stable alliance In view of the scarcity of oflicers in Petlura&apos;s army, energetic and successful attempts are being made to persuade Wrangel&apos;s officers to enlist in the Ukrainian army.The Position and Prospects of the Soviet.Private information indicates that the Soviet Government has settled into three groups, the first a strong group of Extreme Moderates  Krassin, Lunacharsky, &amp;c , very well supported by the Intelligentsia aud by the more educated workmen, the second the Centre, headed by Lenin himself, supported by Trotsky, Dzerjinsky, &amp;c., aud the third the Extreme Left, headed by Zinovieff and Bukharin, who are the most influential members of the Third International, stand in violent opposition to Lenin, Trotsky, and the rest, and are organising the workmen of Petrograd against Lenin. Tchitcherin and Litvinoff have no policy but perpetual opposition. Against Trotsky&apos;s and Krassin&apos;s desire Tehitcheriu has insisted upon choosing his assistants as he thinks fit. As regards the general situation, Lenin and Trotsky would appear to be earnest in their ideas of reconstruction, but the general disintegration proceeds so rapidly that their efforts are practically helpless against it. Krassin thinks the Soviet Government Avill remain established, provided nothing happens to it within the next year or 18 months, and provided foreign capital can be interested in Russia. Lenin&apos;s change of policy continues steadily, but in so far as he favours freedom for the trade unions and the workmen he is in conflict with Trotsky, who advocates an iron discipline.A report from Constantinople states that the control of military and foreign affairs has been entrusted to Trotsky, Dzerjinsky, and Bukharin.
LHvinolF succeeds Tchitclievin as Minister for Foreign Affairs and is to control internal affairs and economic reconstruction. Zinovieff is to devote himself even more to the organisation of the Third International.Rumours are about that Lenin is suffering from a nervous breakdown and that Trotsky has sent for Professor Bekhteroff, the well-known Russian alienist, in order that he may give an opinion on Loniu&apos;s mental faculties. A. Helsingfors report states that Trotsky is seriously ill, suffering from cancer of the lungs.Radek has returned to Moscow after a long time spent in organising propaganda posts on tho Indian frontier.The Position o! Lenin.The brief lull in the struggle over the economic policy has been followed by a fresh Left Wing attack upon Lenin and his group. The extremists of the Left Wing are pursuing a policy of obstruction and discredit, which in finding support among the anarchistically-minded workers. The more moderate followers of Trotsky are inclined to take up a &quot;wait and see&quot; attitude towards internal reforms, but the whole group is at one in its opposition to concessions to foreigners and is doing all it can to end them, holding that the Government is committing itself irretrievably.Lcuin is reported to realise more clearly than his extremist colleagues the parlous condition of tho Soviet regime. He would appear to bo engaged upon an attempt to reconcile the bourgeoisie and the anti-Bolshevist Socialist elements, and to evade catastrophe by a compromise agreement possibly resulting in a &quot;Coalition&quot; government. Lenin roundly told a confidential meeting of leaders of the Communist Party that the economic life of Russia was on the eve of a complete breakdown. The only hope lay in the Entente, which made the economic support of Russia conditional on the immediate convocation of a freely elected Con-stituent Assembly. They must accept those conditions and call a Constituent Assembly provided that a &apos;Communist majority was safe-guarded at the elections.Lenin on Communist Policy.Summing up the proceedings at the recent All Russian Communist Party Conference, Lenin made some frank admissions. Their aim was, he said, to ascertain whether the new policy had been understood in the provinces and if their policy were correct. Concessions had been made to the peasants that portion of the toiling class which formed the majority in Russia. These concessions would, however, only be given within certain limits which the Communist Party would itself determine. As regards the food shortage, Lenin, confessed that the food control dictatorship was more than ever required, so frequent were abuses. While the inhabitants of Moscow and Petrograd were starving, the grain-producing governments had produced twice as much as the supplies that were set aside for them, and had given the Soviet half of what it was entitled to. Without compulsion they would obtain nothing. Lenin pointed out that without a supply of at least 400,000,000 poods of grain there could be no question of any improvement in the large industries or in the work of Socialist construction. A very active organisation was required for the collection of the tax in kind, and any liberal talk in connection with the matter was entirely out of the question.The resolutions passed at the Conference affirmed that the principal political task of the moment was a complete change of the old economic policy and the carrying out of a new policy, the main feature of which was exchange of goods, to be concentrated in the hands of the Co-operatives.
Private persons and co-operative societies and unions might be allowed to lease State enterprises, and, local economic organisations had the right of concluding such agreements without waiting for permission from higher organisations. A few days ago, a Russian industrial magnate, M. Ber, had an interview with Klishko, who urged him to got his mines in the Perm Government to work. When M. Ber suggested going there himself Klishko dissuaded him on the ground that the Soviet Government could undertake to protect him only in Moscow and Petrograd. Generally speaking all measures must be concentrated in the one all-important task of the moment the collection of 400,000,000 poods of grain by means of the tax and by means of exchange.The Peasants and the New Policy.Reports continue that the peasants look with little favour upon recent concessions. Their surplus products can only be disposed of through the Co-operatives. The articles they require in exchange, such as clothing or a wheel for their cart, are never available. Surplus products in the factories such as boats, machinery, &amp;c, are refused by the Co-operatives, as they have no market for them owing to the general dislocation of industry.The peasants are not trying to increase the area under cultivation ; even in Central Russia, where propaganda in favour of the new decrees has met with rather more success than elsewhere, there is no appreciable increase iu the land sown. Iu South Russia the new policy is generally regarded as a sign of capitulation by the Government, and has, if anything, accelerated the insurgent movement. In the towns the workers are discontented over payment of premiums in kind, which are said not to be equitably distributed, since the produce of some trades is more valuable than that of others.The authorities secretly admit that the revenue obtained in 1920 under the &quot;contribution&quot; system was 260,000,000 poods only, not 420,000,000 as was officially stated. The revenue for 1921 under the new system of taxation is put at 240,000,000 poods, which is unlikely to leave any surplus in the hands of the peasants, A warning note states that there is no doubt that the organisation and collection of the tax in kind will be more difficult than the collection of the levy.Various mining and industrial concerns have been ordered to set aside a percentage of their output for the purpose of exchange and rewards in kind. These percentages appear to vary from 5 to ^ per cent., but it is hard to believe, in face of the extreme lowness of output, that they will reach any substantial quantity. Moscow states that a special stock of articles has been set aside for the issue of rewards in kind to peasant craftsmen. It is hoped that the deduction of percentages will make it possible to exchange the goods thus obtained for 120,000,000 poods of grain. This will give each workman approximately 20 (?) poods of bread per year.The Return to Capitalism.In logical sequence, the restoration of the banks and the return of factories and works is to follow the restoration of &quot; free trade &quot; and of &quot; small capitalist&quot; industry. The Commissariat of Finance has prepared a decree permitting private individuals to hold any amount of capital they may have either at home or in the banks. Another decree, simul-taneously drafted, orders that all sums deposited by private individuals in the institutions subordinated to the Commissariat of Finance or the Co-operative Associations can be confiscated only by decision of theO   15382 D
Revolutionary or People&apos;s Tribunals. Sums deposited by private iudi-viduals in such institutions are to be returned to their owners in cash immediately upon their demand. Tlie Commissariat of Industry has offered the owners of certain mills and factories the post of directors, with tho right to change and replace the administrative stall&apos; appointed by the Soviet Government, and to run the mills on their own account, guaranteeing the State a certain percentage of the goods produced.M. Krassin&apos;s Return to Moscow.M. Krassin&apos;s return to Moscow on July 8th appears to have had a two-fold purpose, his main concern being to make arrangements with the Soviet authorities for the resumption of the activities of Russo-Asiatic Consolidated. His second, on the political side, is to come to a settle-ment of accounts with Litvinoff, now the acting Foreign Minister in Tchitcherin&apos;s absence.The Germans, realising that for tho next 10 years at least they will be of small financial aid to Russia, are preparing plans and schemes to be financed by England or America, and since everything must have a beginning Krupp&apos;s are now understood to have made arrangements to deliver 1,000,000/. worth of machinery as a contribution to Russo-Asiatic Consolidated enterprise. On the other hand, the Schiff group in America are understood also to be interesting themselves largely in it, and are understood to be bringing pressure to bear on the American Government to start business with Russia. Max Warburg, the German financier, is negotiating with this group for the purchase of a portion of Mr. Urqu-hart&apos;s interest in Russo-Asiatic Consolidated, the Americans, it is under-stood, stipulating for a controlling interest and a majority of the shares. This it appears improbable that Mr. Urquhart will concede.With the German Heavy Industrials such as Krupp, the Allgemeine Elektrizitats-Gesellschaft, and Siemens Schukert, in sympathy with and in favour of working with England, it is clear in whose interest M. Krassin is making his journey. He goes as the emissary of a combine of American, British, and German manufacturers, probably ready to oppose on the one hand the influence of the mere commercialists and financiers in Germany, who are in favour of dealing not so much with England as with America, and certainly ready on the other to stand up both to the Bukharin-Radek group of anti-concessionists and to Lenin in so far as the latter may find it necessary to bend to their pressure.He is now openly fighting the Third International, whose intense hostility he has incurred by his disapproval of their attempts to foster unrest in England. His choice of specialist commercial and industrial subordinates, like Stomaniakoff in Berlin and Starkoff, whom he failed to get into England, his selection for the preparation of the new Russian Juridical Laws of Tagantzeff, a well-known senator and a notable lawyer under the Czarist regime, have all told against him with the Communists, who find ample material in all his activitiei for accusing him of capitalistic ideas.And in addition there is Litvinoff. The antagonism here is of a personal character. The leading motive of Litvinoff is his own personal aggrandizement, which requires the survival of the Soviet regime. This ruling motive fits in better with the designs of the extremists of the Third International than does Krassin&apos;s. LitvinofFs recall of Stomania-koff, Krassin&apos;s protege and head of the commercial delegation in Berlin, who had refused visas to certain Russian members of the Communist)
International carrying funds destined for England to Berlin (2,000/. were to be delivered to members of the British Communist Party there) is the issue upon which the personal antipathy of the two men will be mainly fought out. There is good authority for stating that if Krassiu does not get his way and is unable to maintain his positiou aud policy unaltered in the face of Litvinoff and the Russian Communists, he may cut himself adrift altogether from the Communist experiment, send in his resignation to the Russian authorities and devote himself entirely to the work of the International Consortium of Manufacturers and Financiers now planning a return to Russia.The Position of the Co-operatives.The hollowness of recent promises of emancipation of the Co-opora-tives is evidenced by the instructions lately issued that Communist party workers must take direction of all meetings organised by Co-operatives, and that at these meetings members of tho Co-operatives must agitate in favour of the new decrees. Furthermore, the chief positions in the Co-operatives are to be held by members of the Communist Party.The Non-Party Movement.The non-parly movement, unchecked by measures of repression, is said to be increasing steadily. It was helped by the Kronstadt rising, and is now so strong that the Bolsheviks cannot ignore its existence. It is significant that over 500 non-party members were elected to the Moscow Soviet. No leader capable of co-ordinating the various scattered groups has yet appeared, but he will doubtless emerge as time proceeds. The non-party organisation, which represents all those who are tired of parties and of the Communists in particular, is closely allied with the trades unions, from which it appears to draw most of its members ; it is also largely supported by the Anarchist and Syndicalist groups which claim to be in close touch with Makhuo. There is said to be much truth in Lenin&apos;s assertion that the Mensheviks and Social Revolutionaries use the non-party movement as a cover for their activities, though they represent a very small percentage of the actual non-party membership.As counter measures the Soviet is introducing Communists into the non-party organisations, and offering influential non-party members important positions in Government departments a snare which has usually been spread in vain.The Anarchist International.The Moscow Central Committee of the Anarchist International has instructed its branches and agents to set to work immediately for the establishment of the Fourth Anarchist International. The Committee dreams of replacing the Communist Soviet Government by an Anarchist Soviet Government, basing its expectations on the practical control of the important Soviet Committees by their Anarchist members, on the growth of anti-Semitism in Governmental circles aud amongst the Russian people generally, and on the general hatred of the inefficient and intolerant Soviet centralism. The Anarchists argue that Communism is alien to Western civilisation, though they do not explain how far anarchism is akin to it, that the general exhaustion and unrest favour anarchism, and that over-centralisation is likely to cause a reaction in favour of extreme decentralisation represented by anarchism. They intend to use the Syndicalist movement as a means of bringing aboutP 2
an International Federation of Trade Unions, including brain workers, aud independent of Socialist, Communist, or Christian trade unionism. Communist disturbances are to be influenced on lines of anarchist revolution.The Communist Women&apos;s Congress.The Communist Women&apos;s Congress at Moscow was opened by Alexandra Kollontay in the name of the Action Committee and Inter-national Secretariat on the Communist International for work amoiur women. Little that was new or striking was heard. Denunciations of capitalism, appeals to women to become active revolutionaries, and laments over the backwardness of the women of the East were the themes of many speeches. The German delegate, Gerten, said that the dictatorship of the proletariat was more necessary for women than it was for men, because it would release them both from the oppression of capitalism and from the family ties existing under the bourgeois regime. This amiable lady declared that it was imperative to teach women the handling of firearms, so that they would be able to participate directly in revolutionary battles.Trotsky told the Congress that world revolution was not so near as it seemed two years ago, and the tempo must be slower. The Third International had for task to stiffen revolutionary moral.The Congress of the Third International.The twice postponed Congress of the Third International has at length been held, but the reports that have been allowed to reach the outer world through the columns of such organs of Moscow as the &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; &quot; L&apos;Humanite,&quot; and the &quot; Rote Fahne &quot; have contained little but the threatening and sonorous platitudes of which a sceptical world is growing weary. The insecurity of the Soviet regime aud the fear of hostile demonstrations were responsible for the sober opening ceremonies. The committee charged with preparing the organisation of the Third Congress of the Communist International is reported to have been composed of Tomsky, for Russia ; Rosmer, alias Griot, for France ; and Murphy, for England.The sessions seem to have passed without disturbances, to have been indeed rather humdrum, but the proceedings were well managed, and the speakers and the matter of their speeches were carefully selected before-hand. There was strife, nevertheless, between the supporters of Lenin and the extremists. Lenin received considerable support from the German delegates. No secret was made of the fact that the Inter-national contemplates an &quot; offensive of the proletariat&quot; in the near future. Trotsky, who seems to have been the chief prophet, was predicting a naval clash between England and America, and Zinovieff, the chief apologist, was proclaiming that what reactionaries described as defeats for com-communism were in reality inevitable retreats. Loriot (France), Koeneu (Germany), Gennari (Italy), and Kolaroff (Bulgaria), were chosen vice-presidents ; Muna (Prague), Brandler (Berlin), and Inkpin (London) were named honorary members of the executive. Zinovieffs position in the International is greatly strengthened. He is said to have quarrelled with Trotsky over the activities of the International in Russian affairs, to have resigned his position as Governor of Petrograd, and to be no longer connected with the Soviet Government. The resignation had nothing to do with propaganda abroad.Before the Conference a secret meeting in Moscow of the Communist Party discussed the question of the Third International and recognised, however reluctantly, that the worldwide weakening of the Communist
movement rendered imperative a change in the conditions for joining tho Third International. These conditions should he so modified that the workmen&apos;8 organisations of Europe would accept Moscow&apos;s new pro-gramme. It is expected that this will strengthen Communist influence in Europe and eventually ameliorate the position at home.The Central Bureau of the Western European Secretariat of the Third International is reported to attribute the failing success of agitation to tactical mistakes committed by the centre and to contradictory circulars and orders.In Russia itself the Communist Party would appear to be stagnant, where it is not actually losing in membership. Many members, especially demobilised soldiers, are secretly ceasing to support the party, though they remain members of it.The Prospects of Foreign Trade.Confirmation has been received of Krassin&apos;s statements that the Soviet had no more gold for export to foreign countries, and that the collapse of the present regime was approaching. Lenin is reliably reported to have said recently that it was impossible to export anything from Russia, as there was not enough for the needs of the country, aud the stock of gold was not sufficient to allow any of it being sent abroad. Ignatieff, Chief of the Bolshevik Trade Delegation at Helsingfors, has also stated that purchases are impossible for lack of money.The only serious business which the Soviet is undertaking is said to lie in the purchase of raw materials for the railways. Soviet policy is first to re-construct the railways ; no purchases will be made for any other purpose until the transport system is in part repaired.In order to obtain the foreign goods which it needs the Soviet will be obliged to add 160,000,000 gold roubles to the foodstuffs which it can exchange. It has been decided to spend 35,000,000 roubles on agri-cultural implements, 25,000,000 on textile goods and cotton, 15,000,000 on iron goods, 5,000,000 on haberdashery, and 5,000,000 on leather soles.Frise, who came to Berlin with Scheinmann and Krestinski, has been appointed head of the purchasing commission of the Soviet Government. He is said to have been negotiating the purchase of war material with certain French merchants.Krassin&apos;s Negotiations.Reporting to Moscow, Krassin is said to put at 300,000,000/. the credits which he will seek to open in England, though he does not attempt to conceal the difficulty which the Soviet finds in meeting current accounts. According to the &quot; Echo de Paris &quot; he asks capitalism to furnish the Third International in return for scraps of paper.Krassin has informed Tchitcherin that his orders cannot be carried out in view of the telegram received from Moscow to the effect that all orders except those for food supplies are to be cancelled. In view of the fact that no special credits have been sent Tchitcherin has been asked in future to send all orders through the People&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Trade and to transfer the necessary money at the same time. As for food supplies, Krassin has reported that the purchase of these is progressing favourably. Goods are being sent via Reval as shippers are afraid of going to Petrograd. Krassin suggested that Petrograd repre-sentatives of Lloyd&apos;s should be sent to examine the approaches to the
port and tho port itself, but the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs seems to have refused its consent, which was finally obtained after tedious dolays. Krassin sarcastically remarks that tho Petrograd workers had received their food supplies a few weeks later because permission was not granted in due time for the representatives to examine the ports. &quot; It is time we dropped a policy that does more harm to ourselves than to anyone else.&quot;Krassin has been informed that another 2,400,000 tons of furnace coke are required for the Southern districts. In view of the critical situation in the extreme North with regard to supplies tho chief fuel department urgently demanded a certain delivery of not less than ten thousand tons of coal in Murmansk by the last week in June. Failure of delivery will prevent the Siberian Sea Expedition, which provides grain for the extreme North, from making its annual voyage, with very grave consequences. Moscow has informed Krassin that for food supplies and articles in great use by the workmen, including Petrograd, 25 million roubles have been set aside, six to seven million of this sum being for flour. There may possibly be an addition to transfers of money to Krassin, including one million dollars in March, three million dollars in May, and four million dollars in June. Krassiu has also been informed that for trading with the villages the purchase is absolutely necessary of iron for wheel hoops and for horse shoes, horse shoe nails, spades, rakes, pitchforks, hatchets and saws.Krassin has reported to the Soviet that Vickers, together with Krupps, are making an offer to the Soviet to start a company for repairing Russian locomotives, using, however, Russian Avorks or Avorks in the Baltic States. Krassin insists that this offer deserves great attention in view of the fact that it will eventually allow the Soviet to give orders with long-time credit. He asks Moscow not to conclude any agreement for the repairing of locomotives abroad without first com-communicating Avith London. Vickers and Krupps are considering the repairing of 1,000 locomotives. This must be borne in mind during negotiations Avith the Finns.Put in touch with Krassin through the intermediary of the Depart-ment of Overseas Trade, the Directors of the Russo-Asiatic Corporation, Ltd., were offered a concession of their old mines and other properties. They replied, after consideration, that the proposal could only be discussed if the Soviet Government returned all the properties in full repair and working order. All current accounts, deposits, &amp;c, and especially the gold taken from the Company&apos;s vaults, should be restituted. Negotiations Avere broken off on an unsatisfactory reply from Moscow, but Krassin now seems anxious to renew them.The Red Army and Navy.Reval messages talk of an organisation of rebellions throughout Russia. The Urals are said to have already been captured by Cossacks, who are negotiating with Cossacks elsewhere regarding a joint front against the Reds and co-operation with the rebellious troops in Ukrainia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. The Bolsheviks have organised three armies, one for South Russia, the second for Caucasia and the third for Transcaucasia. Brussiloff is Commander-in-Chief, with temporary headquarters at Kharkoff, Avhither Trotsky is going.The recent extensive demobilization has been followed by a general order for the mobilization of all classes up to 48 years in the Northern Governments, and probably throughout Russia. The official reason given for this order is the risings in Siberia, where the Soviet regards the situation as very serious.   It is also suggested that an advance against
Poland is contemplated. Serious riots have followed the issue of the order, and many persons have taken refuge in Finland. The effective strength of the Red Armies is put at 320,000.Owing to the immunity given by the Latvian Government, very large desertions from the Lettish battalions are said to have taken place. The Chinese, who do not number in Petrograd more than 2,000 to 3,000, remain.Litvinoff would appear to agree with the idea of selling Soviet naval ships for scrapping, although the Naval and Military Authorities have so far given no opinion. Whether the ships are taken back to Russia or sold for scrapping they could be taken over from the British Government at once. Litvinoff has asked Krassin for information as to whether it is technically possible to sell the ships for scrapping and whether it will be possible to hold an auction.The Soviet and Concessions.It is said that during Krassin&apos;s stay in Moscow Lazerson gave him the normal conditions for the exploitation by concessionaires of the oil bearing territories, consisting of 30 clauses with four technical supple-ments. During Krassin&apos;s absence in Russia a different addition of the same condition consisting of 40 clauses with several variations was brought to London. Krassin has now informed Tchitcherin that he considers as final the later edition given to him by Lazerson, especially in view of the fact that the lengthier edition contains certain conditions which cannot be carried out, such as an application on the part of the concessionaire to pay the government in money the cost of the existing plant.Soviet Gold.Three consignments of gold sent from Russia to Stockholm during May numbered respectively 146 cases (approximate value 10,000,000 roubles) ; 20 boxes and 83 boxes. Between May 15th and 19th two waggon loads of gold containing 500 boxes and one bag, total weight 2,000 poods, arrived at Narva from Russia.5,000,000 gold roubles are reported to have been shipped on May 17th via Murmansk to the United Kingdom, in support of the miners&apos; strike. The gold was to be landed in Ireland and thence transferred on a Norwegian steamer to England.The estimated output of gold in the Urals for 1921 is only 17 poods, whereas that of 1913 was 655 poods.Foreign Trade Notes.Mr. H. M. Hodgson, formerly Consul-General at Vladivostock and later commercial counsellor for Russia, has been appointed head of the British Trade Delegation to Russia.Moscow reports the arrival there of a delegation of Finnish manufac-turers and bankers. The delegation proposes to deliver large quantities of agricultural implements, paper, and metals. The Finns greatly need such raw materials as flax and hemp.According to Hillerson, the Brazilian Consul for the whole of Central Europe, has asked permission to come to Russia for the purpose of obtaining correct information and for the establishment of direct trade relations. Krassin has stated that the Brazilian should be admitted, close watch being kept on him.
In connection with tho allegation of Soviet dealings with Sinn Fein, it would appear that the Soviet Delegation intended giving a sharp reply, pointing out the alleged falseness of the facts published. Second thoughts appear to have convinced tho Soviet of the unwisdom of this action. It has been discovered &quot; by chance &quot; that early in 1920 the Sinn Feiners negotiated with Nuorteva in America, and presented the draft agreement which was published in the press and which Moscow professes never to have seen. The conclusion come to is that it would be well to present a note, pointing out that negotiations were actually carried on, but that this was before signing the Trade Agreement and that the Soviet Government knew nothing of the published draft agreement. &quot; A complete denial might place us in an awkward position.&quot; It is doubtful if any note will be presented.It is admitted that MacCurtan was in Russia, but he was not received with honours, and left at the suggestion of the Soviet.The Soviet is reported to have decided to begin legal action against the Morning Post over the Russo-Irish agreement published by that paper. There are hints of action against the Times in connection with the alleged inventions by a Helsingfors correspondent concerning Zinovieff, Dzerjinsky, and LitvinofF.Moscow and the British Miners.The Daily Herald of May 28th reported that the Fourth Trades Union Congress at Moscow had voted 200,000 gold roubles to the British miners. On June 27th, Krassin, writing to Lozovsky in Moscow, expressed his satisfaction that there was no official knowledge in England of this action. The money was not sent and he could not tell how the miners would regard its sending ; but the only effect of the assignment had been to give a further pretext to agitation against the Soviet Government for interference in England&apos;s home affairs.Whether or not it was intended to send the money, there can be no doubt of the effect of the announcement, or that it was an interference in British internal affairs. If the money was not sent, the announcement was propaganda tending to prolong the strike.Miscellaneous.Moscow is suggesting the formation of an International Union of Revolutionary Co-operatives.Several anarchists and members of the I.W.W., deported from America, were, on their arrival at Libau, refused permission to enter Russia.Russian miners are reported to have carried out a Subnotnik (Com-munist Sunday) for the benefit of the English miners on June 12th. The result of the day&apos;s work were given to the English miners.A strong anti-British feeling is reported to prevail among the ex-Russian landowners who are included in the remnants of wrangel&apos;s forces. In some cases Germans are said to have been buying the title deeds of such emigres in Constantinople.S. Das Gupta has stated that some 500 Indians, chiefly Punjabis and frontier tribesmen, are being instructed in the art of war by Bolshevik elements in Turkestan. Indians are mustered on the Indian frontier, engaged in general preparations for the day when revolution is launched in India.A Stockholm paper is responsible for a report that Tchitcherin has intimated to the British Government his hope that it will not assist plans
for helping, through the League of Nations, the anti-Bolshevik troops still in arms. The Soviet maintains that the assistance desired, which is for the help of pro-Russian refugees, would be a breach of the Anglo-Russian agreement.The People&apos;s Commissariat for Nationalities is said to have founded a new university for the Workmen of the East, chiefly of the tribes of Central Asia.Krassin has once again asked Tchitcherin to investigate the case of Eisenstein with all despatch. Eisenstein, an eminent expert on wireless telegraphy, was arrested by tho Moscow Extraordinary Commission on some alleged oversight. Krassin warns Tchitcherin &quot; that the arrest on &quot; a charge like this of a great expert enjoying European reputation &quot; jeopardises the business reputation of the Soviet in the eyes of &quot; European business circles.&quot;J. T. Murphy, who was recently sent by Moscow to Geneva to watch the Transport Workers&apos; Congress, appears to have been arrested, and to have to stand his trial by a special committee of the Third International. The charge against him is that he once acted as an agent of the British police ; he appears to have been employed several years ago by an unofficial organisation.FINLAND.The authorities have arrested Heikkila, an editor, one of the most dangerous leaders of the Communists.The Social Democrats, who are by no means well disposed towards the Communists, have considerably helped the authorities in their recent capture of arms and ammunition, &amp;c. One of the grievances of the Democrats is that the Communists, who cannot get them to join in their more active work, has ceased supplying the Democrats with funds.The Communists, who continue the development of their military organisation, are reported to have made a division into higher units, i.e., brigades. Communism is advancing concurrently, and the party is now said to number about 110,000 members. There are hints that a revolution may be attempted simultaneously with action in other countries.Baltic States. ESTHONIA.The danger of Communist disturbances seems to have been conjured by energetic police action. An Esthonian Communist named Raudsepp has been arrested on charges of issuing false passports to Esthonian Communists while in America. Three of his assistants had previously been arrested for anti-Government propaganda. Liegemetz, another Communist leader, assistant to Kingisepp, has died.The Bolshevik Trade Delegation in Reval have opened a new office in the harbour for the purpose of dealing with transit goods arriving from Russia. Seventeen members of the Delegation have gone into summer quarters at Nomme, a suburb of Reval. Their quarters are being closely watched ; at the end of May two men, Communists from the Kull Works in Reval, were arrested there.It is reported that local German agents are seeking to acquire factories and storehouses in Esthonia and Latvia. These places will be maintained under their original names, and may be used for the storage of German goods for re-exportation.
A certain Ivan Gorbov, who reached Roval from Hclsingfors towards the end of May, was found to possess a considerable quantity of money, and two telegrams in cypher addressed to the Assistant Chief of Customs, Verchinsky. Gorbov is suspected to bo an agent of the Helsingfors Bolshevik Delegation, and the money is thought to have been meant for the Custom House employees who at that time were on strike.LITHUANIA.Aralov, the new Bolshevik representative at Kovno, is reported to possess an influence far smaller than Axelrod&apos;s, and a considerable diminution of Soviet prestige is noticeable in consequence.The Agrarian Reform Bill is not in smooth waters. It has widened the split in the Christian Democratic Party, who are in conflict over the amount of land individual landowners should be allowed to retain and over methods of compensation. A compromise is, however,, hoped for. The National Socialists oppose all compensation and wish to see property divided into holdings of less than 50 hectares ; the Social Democrats stand for complete nationalisation of all land and the abolition of private ownership.LATVIA.Bolshevik Trade Methods.A representative of a factory for agricultural machinery at West-phalia, who recently visited Latvia for the purpose of attempting to negotiate orders with the Bolshevik Mission, found that business was impossible owing to the unacceptable conditions imposed. He also stated that Lettish firms which had been negotiating with the Bolsheviks concerning the erection by the latter of factories in Latvia had broken oflf relations, and that orders given had been cancelled.The Position of Communism.Litvinoff is said to have been ordered to Riga to take such measures as are possible in view of the wholesale arrests and consequent breaking up of the Lettish Section of the Third International, which have greatly alarmed the Third International. Litvinoff went to Riga with Ganetsky, and thence to Moscow for the Third Congress. Leonid Stark is acting for Litvinoff during his absence.The circulation by the Central Committee of the Lettish Communist Party of propaganda literature, introduced iu the diplomatic bags of the Russian representative, has resulted in the arrest of 17 members of the committee, including Schilf, the party secretary. Schilf is an ardent Communist, who was left behind by the Bolsheviks after they evacuated the country, with the duty of organising the Communist movement. The propaganda literature iu question is said to be printed at Pskov.The Windau Communist organisation professes satisfaction with the work it has done, but laments that repressions and lack of initiative have had an influence on the number of new members. Agitation among navvies is to be increased.Trades Union organisation in Latvia has been hampered by the too ardent affection for Communism of Libau Trades Unionists. The Government was in consequence driven to adopt repressive measures to counteract Communist influences.Lettish Communists in Moscow are reported to be trying, without success, to induce demobilised Lettish Red soldiers to carry on an
intensive agitation against tlie Lettish Government by participating in the &quot;germ cell&quot; organisation in Russian territory on the Latvian frontier. Out of 400 demobilised Letts only 10 were willing to fall in with this scheme ; the rest wished to return to Latvia as peaceful citizens. Most Letts, in civilian employ in Russia, are hostile to the Communist regime.Anti-Semitism is groAving strongly, both in the civil population and in the army. The primary cause is the arrival of large numbers of Jews from Russia, who are alleged to have entered the country on false passports, and to have indulged in wholesale speculation in Czar roubles.The subversive activities of the Jewish Arbeiterheim in Libau and Riga have been followed by an arrest imposed on its funds. Some of the money furnished by Jewish societies in America for the feeding oi children seems to have been used for propaganda amongst Jewish workmen.POLAND. Communist Projects and Policy.The Bolsheviks&apos; new policy of parallel action with the Government is slowly winning them ground. The Communists enlisted among the Upper Silesiau insurgents support the military ; the Bolsheviks seem to aim at encouraging the Poles in their headstrong career until their continued existence as a State becomes impossible.It is reported in confidence that at the end of April the Third International, through the Western European Secretariat, instructed Fochel, who is in charge of the Communist organisation at Danzig, that for the lime being no action to which the Polish Government could object was to be taken. Strictly secret work might be continued, but it was most important that the results of such work should not be apparent before the expiry of three months at least. Fochel did not very willingly transmit these instructions to the branches of his organisation in Poland. The agents were told that peace must be preserved for the present, so that the Polish bourgeoisie aud capitalists might convince themselves that the Communists had no hostile intention towards them. Party discipline necessitated compliance with these injunctions.The instructions given by the Third International, which involve the temporary abandonment of a policy of fomenting racial hatred between Germany and Poland, have displeased the Germans but pleased the Poles. Consolation is sought in the growth of illegal organisations on both sides in Upper Silesia, which will, it is hoped, lead to increased tension and internal dissensions, and in the hostility shown by the Poles towards Russian refugees in Poland. The people of Dantzig are re-ported to think more of trade than of armed defence of their proletarian rights.OneKazimir Erbansky is reported to act as liaison agent between the Polish section of the Third International and the Western European Secretariat (in Berlin).The withdrawal from the Socialist Party of the Deputy Lancucki appears to have raised for definite solution the problem of forming an official Polish Communist Party. Lancucki is a railwayman representing Jaroslau in the Polish Diet. His Communist sympathies are not new, and his personal influence is so considerable that his appearance at popular meetings and his advocacy of Communism in the Diet will
greatly further the development of the Polish Communist Party. The proletarisation of tho Polish masses is said to be making extraordinary progress.Relations with Russia.Moscow reports that the Polish Council of Ministers has decided to open two legations, one in Soviet Russia and the other in the Ukraine. Darovski will be appointed minister to Moscow and Kolanovski to Kharkoff.A note has been addressed to the Polish Government by Rakovsky, President of the Ukrainian Soviet, drawing attention to the help and co-operation which the Polish authorities are alleged to accord to tho Ukraine Counter-Revolutionary formation. This is looked upon as au infringement of the Riga Treaty ; the Ukraine Government insists upon au accurate fulfilment of the treaty.Krassin has asked Tchitcherin why Poland has not been approached on the subject of transit of locomotives and other goods, a matter which had been definitely agreed upon in Moscow. He adds that the Soviet could always make political use of Polaud&apos;s refusal, and show up before the Polish masses the entire futility of the economic policy of the present Polish Government.   Most energetic pressure is asked for.In accordance with the terms of the Riga Treaty, all the Polish prisoners of war are returning to Poland from Russia. Efforts were made to pervert them, but the scanty food in the camps and the decay aud disorder all about were sufficient to counteract all Communist pro-paganda. The returning prisoners were amply supplied with agitation material, and an &quot; agitation &quot; carriage accompanied each train.Wozniesienski, member of the Soviet Repatriation Commission to Poland, has reported that agitation among the Poles will meet with no success, as the antagonism towards Bolshevism is too strong owing to the short period which has elapsed since hostilities ceased. Hope is centred on the West, whence will come workmen sent to improve Polish industry and imbued with Communist ideas. The Commission asks for liberty of propaganda among Russians now in Poland, which is under-stood not to be prohibited by the Riga Treaty. The position in Russia is to be fully explained to these people, who, it is suggested, should not return if they will agree with Soviet policy.Miscellaneous.A so-called Russian Agrarian Society has been formed in Warsaw. It is anti-Bolshevik and composed of Conservative Russian elements, has no connection with Savinkoff s organisation, and appears to have been in some measure financed from Germany.Dimitri Rubinstein, the well-known Petrograd banker and speculator, has been in Poland on the invitation of Steczkowski, the Polish Minister of Finance. He has now gone to Prague. Rubinstein has hitherto never failed of trimming bis sails to the prevailing wind. Powerfully favoured at Court and financed by the Germans, he depressed the Russian valuta during the first years of the war. When the crash came he entered into relations first with Kerenski and afterwards with Lenin, who directed his (Rubinstein&apos;s) work from Berlin. After the revolution Rubinstein, anxions for his money, settled in Berlin, tie is now acting as a Bolshevik banker and is still in touch with Kopp. Steczkowski seems to have had the idea that Rubinstein would help him to raise the Polish valuta.
5. BALKAN AND EAST EUROPEAN STATES.GREECE.Communist Divisions.The third general meeting of the Greek Communist Party, which was to have been held early in June, has been postponed till September at the earliest. Mobilisation and imprisonment, and chiefly the interference of certain sections of the party with the business of the Executive Com-mittee, are the reasons assigned. Strong action is threatened against these people and blind obedience to the dictates of the Committee is insisted on. This action is directed against the members who argue that the 21 points are not necessarily suited to Greece. Everything is working towards a split of the Communists into two sections. Pappanastasion, a fanatical hothead, is leading the party while Benaroya lies in prison, and he is exacting unquestioning submission to Moscow. An influential section, led bv Sideris, do not wish to commit themselves at once.The Cypriote Communists.A few of the Cypriote students at the University of Athens have joined the local Communist Party aud formed a &quot; Union of Communist Students of Cyprus.&quot; They aim at preventing the union of Cyprus with Greece, at the shaking off of the British capitalist yoke, and the pro-clamation of Cyprus as a Sovietic autonomous democracy. They expect much help from the British Labour Party. On their return from Greece, Cypriote students are to form a similar union in Cyprus, and to work among the labouring and peasant classes of the island. They cherish no great hopes of real success, but they look to the Russian refugees in Cyprus for useful help.The Government and the Peace Breakers.Venizelist workmen, who centre at the piraeus, are observing a discreet silence, lest the Government should be provoked to close their unions. The machinery of the Piraeus Labour Centre has been captured by the Royalists. The Government dealt severely with the railwaymen, the chief Venizelist Union, when they went on strike, mobilised many of the men and sent them to Asia Minor. The capture of the Athens Labour Centre by the Communists was followed by strikes which were crushed by the Government, whose policy is now vigorously anti-Communist. Many Communists are in prison, especially in Macedonia and Thessaly.BULGARIA. The Position of the Communists.Moscow, which is not satisfied with things in Bulgaria, has intimated to the Communist Party that a revision of its political activities iu accordance with present revolutionary requirements is desirable. It is pointed out that revolution does not flourish on propaganda alone, but requires the support of illegal organisations. It is further indicated that the task of the party is simplified by the fact that the Balkan bourgeoisie is not so well organised as in other European countries, and that a Com-munist capture of the Governmental machine would react forcibly on neighbouring countries and hasten the revolution in Western aud Central Europe.
The chief outcome of the Communist Congress is likely to ho an intensification of propaganda in the villages and an effort to capture the peasants. There was a call for bolder action, and a complaint that there was in the party too much of tho intelligentsia and not enough of the manual workers. The leaders of the party seem to be a little embarrassed by the pressure of some of their partisans and the persuasion of foreign sympathisers in tho direction of revolutionary action. The Union of the Communists with the Left group of the Broad Socialists has been approved.The Government and the Extremists.Sinister rumours, without great support, are afloat that the Govern-ment instigated the recent bomb outrage in Sofia in order to make an excuse for drastic measures against the Communists. It should be remembered that the Government is not yet cleared of suspicion of complicity in the bomb outrage in the Odeon theatre a year ago. Another story has it that the Greek authorities suborned a Greek named Stephanos Doumanis to arrange the outrage, which was to pre-cipitate a couflict between the Communists and the Government, and so give the Greeks an excuse to enter the country and seize certain strategic points. Dimitri Girginoff, a tool of Doumanis, is said to have thrown the bomb.The Authorities have managed to dissolve the Communist municipal council of Varna, the most important town in the country after Sofia. The law now in force which imposes upon lawyers the choice of either representing the electorate or of practising at the bar, seems to have been of considerable service here. In fact, eight members of the 24. consti-tuting the Varna Council resigned rather than cease their practice ; two other Communist members were forced to resign for non-compliance with certain domiciliary regulations ; and two non-Communist members have also resigned, leaving the Communists without a majority. The Govern-ment thus secured the dissolution of the Council. A Commission of three new Communist members is now carrying on business. The elections will probably be held after the summer to secure the largest possible agrarian poll. Communism in Varna may no longer be at the flood, but the party would probably again return a majority at any reasonably conducted election.Alleged Bolshevik Plots.A meeting of members of the Thracian and Macedonian Committees and certain Bolshevik delegates is reported to have been held during June, at which the Thracian and Macedonian leaders came to an agree-ment between themselves, by which Macedonia is to be autonomous; the Thracian frontier the same as in 1913. A new front in Thrace will be created should the Allies attack the Turks in Asia Minor.Stambolisky will be assassinated and the Government overturned ; the Communists will seize the secret depots of arms and ammunition, aud make themselves masters of the country. The Bolshevik Headquarters in Sofia are said to talk of collaboration on the Black Sea coast. With a view to obtaining their help, propaganda is to be organised amongst the Russians in Bulgaria by, among others, one Aser Ostrovsky, a Russian Jew, director of the Bulgar-American Company. Ostrovsky was charged, with the help of Tiplitsky, a member of his firm, to choose a reliable agent, said to have been found in the person of a Russian, Mihail Zrensky, who is to go to Manchester to a certain Georgieff, a. Bolshevik representative there, with instructions to, provoke industrial trouble.   No trace of Georgieff has so far been found in Manchester.
Two Turks, Fikreb Bey and Shakir Bey, members of the Bulgarian branch of the Thracian Committee, are to go at once to India to carry on propaganda among the Moslems there.Miscellaneous.The Bulgarian Communists have sent a cheque for 10,000 leva, about 30/., to the &quot;Daily HerahTs&quot; fund for the British miners&apos; families.The Bulgarian Government is said to be sending a Foreign Office official named Abramoff to Berlin, with the object of making inquiries regarding the resumption of trade relations between Bulgaria and Soviet Russia. Abramoff is a personal friend of Stomaniakoff&apos;, the Bulgarian-born Bolshevik trade representative in Berlin.ROUMANIA. Alleged Revolutionary Plans.The raid which followed the recent Congress of Communists at Bucharest is reported to have resulted in the seizure of incriminating documents, which reveal the intention to bring about a revolution in Roumania. Communists of originally Hungarian nationality in Transyl-vania are said to be working on behalf of the Hungarian Government to provoke disturbances in Roumania in favour of Magyar irredentism. The police are said to have proof of the transmit tal of large sums by Moscow for the purpose of revolutionary activities. Four socialist deputies are among those arrested. Simultaneously with the raid on the Socialist Club tho &quot; Socialismul,&quot; the official organ of the Communist Party, was suppressed. It would appear that during the Congress dissatisfaction was expressed at the incompetent handling of the Roumanian Socialist press, and a proposal, which was not carried, was made to establish a central paper in Bucharest.Russian Intentions.The Bolshevik Army is reported to be concentrating on the Bessarabiau front and Red agents are organising Bolshevik forces in Bessarabia. This apparently indicates a repetition of the usual Soviet policy of preceding a Red attack by systematic propaganda, which overthrows the regular Government and establishes a Soviet Government.Tchitcherin himself is reported to have said that there was much more sympathy in Russia for a war against Poland and Roumania than for adventures in the East. The recovery of a fertile area like Bessarabia would greatly help both in the feeding of the army and the civil popula-tion. Tchitcherin nevertheless hesitated to say that Russia was on the eve of a war with Roumania. &quot; We shall most certainly make some &quot; severe demands of her, and our future relations with her will depend &quot; entirely on the nature of her reply.&quot;Miscellaneous.A fresh Communist outrage is reported in Bessarabia, where au explosion took place on a railway bridge, fortunately before the arrival of the train, which was, however, derailed. Five persons were killed and eight wounded.There are reports, possibly exaggerated, that a close connection exists between Jewish organisations in Bessarabia aud the Communist party of Kichinev and Bolshevik organisations of the Dniester. Propaganda agents are said to arrive in the guise of agents of the American Relief Committee.
6. NEAR EASTERN STATES. TURKEY.Angora and the Bolsheviks.The reports received during the last month go to emphasise the unnaturalness of the alliance between the Angora Government aud the Soviet. The story is all of jealousy, reluctance and suspicion. The Nationalists thoroughly mistrust the Bolsheviks and are constantly on their guard against any form of Communist propaganda or intrigue. This feeling has, if anything, increased since the signing of the Treaty, and is now so strong that the Turks refuse to have anything to do even with Mahomedan elements coming in from Russia. A prominent Russian Moslem has affirmed that Bolsheviks and Nationalists are separated by a gulf far too wide to be bridged by a mere treaty or agreement. The alliance had been brought about solely by external political circumstances. At the Eastern Congress in Baku, Zinovieff was trying to persuade the east to establish a system of Soviets on Russian lines as distinct from the mere playthings proposed by the Turkish Government. The Nationalists appear to argue that in their present position a bad peace with Bolshevist Moscow is better than a good war with the Allies.Another report, received at the end of May, described the anxiety of the Nationalists to keep Turkey clean from Communist infection, and the determined action taken to prevent the entry into Anatolia of any Communist agents or agitators. All such known to be in the country had been expelled, including the notorious Mustapha Subhi. The result had been to drive Communism underground. The Nationalists, who are under no delusions as to the proselytising intentions of the Bolsheviks, are closely watching the Bolshevik Mission in Angora and the Soviet Consulate in Trebizonde, as well as all individuals purporting to be trade representatives. The Bolsheviks, for their part, have capable individuals in their pay in all the Nationalist official departments, and they are said to have opened special propaganda bureaux at Tiflis and Batum, with the special object of disseminating propaganda in Anotolia. They are increasing the number of their agents and spending large sums of money in this connection, going to the length of printing counterfeit Turkish paper money.The Soviet/s alternations of flattery and threats are increasingly dis-quieting the Nationalists. The Bolsheviks talk of concentrating a strong force round Kars, which the Turks would be obliged to evacuate, and they threaten Erzerum. Kiazim Kara Bekir, the Turkish Commander there, is said to have been ordered to oppose any Russian advance.Tchitcherin is reported to be on his way from Moscow to Angora to confer personally with Mustapha Kemal on a vast scheme of Asiatic policy. Meanwhile, the difficulties of the Nationalists with their truculent allies are aggravated by internal dissensions. The Govern-ment is reported to be struggling with two hostile parties, the one composed of certain Unionist members of the Great National Assembly and a number of officers returned from the eastern front who are open supporters of Enver ; the other composed of scattered individuals who are working for the fall of the administration in order to establish the influence of the opposition parties in Constantinople. A considerable number of arrests have taken place, as well as some shootings.In general the Committee of U nion and Progress, instigated by Enver Pasha aud supported by the &quot;Bolsheviks, finds itself in sharp conflict with the Nationalists properly so-called.   Bekir Sami Bey is said to have
been sacrificed at the instance of Medvani, the Bolshevik agent, who alleged that Bekir had used hostile language in London against the Bolsheviks. The Government organ at Angora violently accuses Enver of an underhand attempt to seize authority, though he has already plunged the Empire into immeasurable calamities. ft is now divulged that Bekir Sami Bey wished to surrender himself as a hostage, when his Government refused to ratify the exchange of British prisoners.The Russian Trade Delegation and a Reported Plot.Kudish left for England on May 28th with a British ex-officer named Iluskinson, who combines the functions of personal bodyguard and general factotum. He appears to have brought with him certain papers relating to the Wrangelites, for the safety of which ho was much concerned, and to have gone iu terror of being watched by a Wrangelite spy. Brouck appears to have been appointed temporary president of the Delegation during Kudish&apos;s absence ; Zolotarev was to assist in commercial matters, and Fillipovich to be chief of the propaganda section. There were reports that Fillipovich and Augenblick, the former secretary of Kudish, were shortly to go to Athens, ostensibly to establish a Soviet Trade Delegation there, but really to arrange for Bolshevik propaganda in Greece. The woman Vostkova, formerly head of the Checka section of the Delegation, who was arrested by the French, has been replaced by a notorious international spy named Shopov alias Mishich, a Bulgar by birth. Another important new agent is D. L. Pavlovich, a member of the Russian Communist Party, who has lately arrived in Constantinople. Certain Englishmen named Colonel Rule, Major Nichol and Major A. M. McDonell are said to be working in with Kudish in the hope of obtaining concessions or commissions of different kinds.The schemes of the Delegation were shattered at the end of June, when the premises of the Delegation, together with numerous houses occupied by Russian Bolsheviks, were raided by the authorities, and great quantities of documents seized. According to a statement made in the House of Commons, the Commander-in-Chief (Lieut.-General Sir C. Harington) at Constantinople, arrested 52 undesirable persons, of whom 18 belonged to the Russian Trade Delegation, Of these 18 were released on the same day and nine were deported, The action of the Commander-iu-Chief was necessitated by the discovery of a plot to produce a revolu-tion in Constantinople, which was to begin with his own assassination.Reports from other sources declare that a vast plot existed, elaborated down to the minutest details. The murder of Lieut.-General Haringtou and of several members of his staff was to serve as a signal for the rising. The Bolsheviks had even foreseen the towing out of mines into the Straits in order to paralyse the British Fleet. These reports put the number of arrests at over 200, and mention specifically the names of Augenblick, Brouck, Zolotarev, Kovsky, Trukhly, and the representative of the Ukrainian Soviet Government, Filipitch. Kusnetzov, one of the most prominent Soviet agents in Constantinople, is said to have managed to escape.The affair has naturally roused the British organs of Moscow to extreme wrath.   Krassin has asked for an explanation.Miscellaneous.The spread of anti-British propaganda, especially among the Russian refugees, is becoming increasingly apparent in Constantinople. This propaganda would appear to emanate from semi-official French circles, and to be aimed at destroying the pro-British sympathies which were shown until recently by most of the emigrant Russians.0  15382 Til
The growth of the District Communist Committee in Constantinople from comparative insignificance to great hannf illness would appear to coincide with the arrival last April of Mme. Ostrovskaya, tho notorious woman Communist of the Crimea, and the instigator of countless atrocities. This woman took the committee in hand, regularised its relations with the Trade Delegation, of which it became an important adjunct for propaganda, and saw that adequate funds were obtained. The Committee has now been organised in three sections, dealing with information, agitation, and active demonstration.EGYPT.Zagliloiil had no direct concern with the recent disorders, hut the populace was excited by his political campaign, and general opinion inclines to believe that the trouble would not have occurred if Zaghloul had not returned to Egypt.The threatened general railway strike has not materialised. 2,500 men in the railway workshops who stopped work have been summarily dismissed. Even if they are reinstated they will lose gratuity and other rights.According to the Cairo press, there is imminent danger of the infiltration of Bolshevist ideas and organisation into Egypt. A person who was arrested in Upper Egypt was described by a native paper as an accredited Bolshevist propagandist, but he turns out to be a Turk who was previously expelled as undesirable and who, since his return, has been touring the country collecting money ostensibly for the Bolsheviks, but personally pocketing the subscriptions. It is uncertain whether this man is actually a Bolshevist agent or whether, hearing from Constantinople that an emissary from Moscoav was on the way to Egypt, and knowing the country, he conceived the plan of forestalling the real agent for his own ends.PERSIA.A New Cabinet.1,000 Bolsheviks remain at Enzeli, though a promise has been made that their withdrawal will be resumed now that a Government has been formed.   The British withdrawal is complete.Bolshevik Eastern Policy.Nariinanoff, President of the Baku Revolutionary Committee, who has been visiting Moscow, told Tchitcherin that the Russo-Persian Agreement was regarded with a considerable lack of confidence not only in Persia, but also in Mahomedan circles in Azerbaijan and elsewhere. The failure of the Bolsheviks to fulfil the conditions of the Treaty had lost them the confidence of the Persian people. Tchitcherin replied that the Soviet forces were not immediately evacuating Persia because it was necessary to compensate the insistence of the Anglo-Russian Agreement on the cessation of propaganda in the East by other measures which would prevent any weakening of Soviet Russia&apos;s position iu the East. Hence the necessity of establishing Russia&apos;s military position on all the frontier centres in the East. Kemalist successes over the Greeks had also greatly strengthened the national feeling in Moslem countries and weakened the influence of Communist propaganda there. The only concrete force which would back up Russian influence was a military one. Tchitcherin affirmed that the Soviet was not contemplating any military
campaign in the East in the near future. The Soviet attached tremendous importance to the agreement with Great Britain, and their future military activity would depend on how successful they were in profiting by this agreement.SYRIA.Poale Zion.The Left Wing of Poale Zion in Russia, taking for its grievance the disturbances which took place in Palestine on the 1st May, has urged Jewish workers in every country to unite under the flag of the Socialist Workers&apos; Party, or Poale Zion. The disturbances are attributed to the British, working together with the Arabian Nationalists.A section of Poale Zion in Palestine writes to the General Secretary in London enlarging on the critical position which prevails. Most of the teachers in the seminary are ill or have been obliged to go away on leave; the students fluctuate; there is absolutely no money. &quot;Every &quot; source of happiness has dried up. The whole business may at any &quot; time come to a stop.&quot;   Money is asked for.Communism in Palestine.The Palestine Communist Party, Section of the Third International, formed itself in April of this year, aud resolved to build up its organisa-tion on national sections, which must be led and controlled by the Communist Party. Every nationality in the country counting 50 members may constitute itself a national section of the Palestine Com-munist Party. Active propaganda against England, the creation of a nucleus for a Red Army and war against the hostile labour parties protected by England are the chief planks of the programme. The Arabs are also to be subverted. Meanwhile the third Conference of the Jewish Communist Party resolved to adhere to the Palestine Communist Party as Jewish section, and demanded the formation of a separate internal Jewish section of the Third International in Moscow for the Jewish world proletariat and the recognition of Palestine as the most important buttle front to-day. Proportionate support by Moscow is also required. The Trades Union movement in Palestine is to be exploited to Communist ends.7. CENTRAL ASIATIC STATES. GEORGIA. The Sovietisation of the Country.The Bolsheviks continue their policy of conciliation, although the Georgian Government has taken radical measures for the sovietisation of the country. The chief role here is being played by the Georgian Communist Party, which has for task to plead and expound the cause of Communism, chiefly among peasants and workmen. The land stolen from the big landowners has been given to the peasants, and the workmen have been given the best houses in Tiflis. This vicarious generosity has not made Soviet power popular, for land and houses do not fill empty stomachs, and food is much scarcer than it was under the Mensheviks. Moreover, prices are very high. Very few new members are joining the Communist Party. The political situation is dominated by a strong antagonism between the Bolshevik military command and the Georgian revolutionary committee.e 2
Miscellaneous.The economic situation in Baku has not greatly improved, and the workers in the oil Holds are still very discontented.Moscow reports that Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan have formed a joint independent Commissariat for Foreign Trade. Rabiuovitch has been designated as Soviet plenipotentiary on this Commissariat, also as representative of the Soviet of Labour and Defence. He will live at Tiflis.The Tiflis Revolutionary Committee is said lately to have given an official banquet to the German and Italian representatives. In replying to a toast in their honour they stated that they were pleased to support present relations with Soviet Georgia-; they believed the Soviet Govern-mcnt had come to stay and that Europe would be compelled to establish relations with it. The German representative, Rauscher, who returned to Tiflis when the Bolsheviks occupied the town, has retained his post as representative of the Soviet Government. A Tiflis newspaper states that 14 Italian trading firms have joined a. consortium of Italian merchants iu Trans-Caucasia in order to facilitate business with the foreign trade departments of the three Trans-Caucasian republics.AZERBAIJAN.The anti-Bolshevist rising is reported to be gaining strength. Azerbaijan bands hold the whole of Karabagh. Pressed by Soviet troops Armenians have crossed the Azerbaijan frontier and joined the insurgent Tartars in their struggle with the Bolsheviks.Lenin is said to have recognised that conditions in Azerbaijan are fundamentally different from those prevailing in Russia and to have recommended to the Azerbaijan Communists a policy of compromise aud leniency towards the educated classes, the peasants and the small bourgeoisie. Local industries must be upheld, and concessions and barter with the west encouraged by the Azerbaijanis themselves iudepen-dently of Soviet Russia.The arrival in Constantinople of Serebrovsky, President of the Azerbaijan Oil Fields Committee, with an autographed hitter from Lenin, was mentioned in last month&apos;s review. This letter seems to have radically altered the attitude of the French towards Serebrovsky, who was given various privileges. The French also tried to conceal the real object of Serebrovsky&apos;s mission, owing, it is said, to a desire to obtain oil concessions in the Caucasus, and to start the construction of a pipe line from Grozny to the Caspian or the Black Sea.AFGHANISTAN. Relations with Russia and Turkey.Suritz has stated that the Afghan Government insists on the rights of Afghan subjects, the surrender of criminals and commercial relations being cleared up without delay. Suritz has suggested that a commercial treaty be concluded between the Soviet and Afghanistan on the basis of proposals made by Russia on May 29th. He urges as a temporary measure that Afghans should hand over their merchandise to their Consuls, who will then only deal with institutions of official character.Reports mention that the Treaty concluded between the Afghans and the Nationalist Turks contains three as yet unpublished clauses, which are being kept strictly secret.   By one of these clauses the
Afghan Government agrees to contribute regularly to the expenses of the revolutionary propaganda organisations already formed or being formed in India, Baluchistan, Eastern Persia and Central Asia and to direct these organisations. Tho Turkish Staff Mission to Afghanistan is to prepare strategical plans for defence and offence on the various frontiers ; the Afghan Army will be reorganised by Turkish officers, and commanded, when the time comes, by the Turkish Staff Mission.The Aims of the Afghan Mission.The Afghan Mission left Rome for Paris early in June. The head of the Mission, General Mohammed Vali Kahu, stated that during their month&apos;s stay in Moscow they had concluded with the Soviet a commer-cial treaty which had not yet been published. The Mission is reported to have for real object to obtain the assistance of Russia, Turkey, Germany and France in securing the complete independence of afghanistan-stan and protection against any British encroachment. The Mission intends to return by way of the United States and Japan, aud has hopes of full recognition by the United States Government.Indian Revolutionary Policy.The Indian Revolutionary Party in Europe is said to have for policy to converge on Afghanistan, where they feel that they have a friend in the Amir. Help is expected from Euver Pasha, who is organising the frontier tribes on the Pamir side and an army in Bolshevik Turkestan. Enver is said to have seen the Afghan Deputation in Moscow during May. He is said to be now in Turkestan, and to be more in touch with the Provisional Government of India in Kabul than with the Indians in Europe.8. FAR EASTERN STATES. SIBERIA.The vladivostock Rising.In connection with the recent Soviet note ou the rising in Vladivostock, Tchitcherin has informed Krassin that it was absolutely necessary for the Soviet to bring the Far East adventure into the sphere of collective Entente policy. Tchitcherin argues that the present hesitation of Japan is partly due to the military preparations of the Soviet in Siberia and to its campaign of agitation in Europe. General Tamanashi, the newly appointed Japanese War Minister, is reported to have affirmed that Japan must pursue her own path and act independently in Siberia.Merkuloffs Government has now taken steps to establish communica-tions with Wrangel. The Japanese are said to have advanced westward from the coast and occupied some strategically important Siberian towns. Meanwhile the deadlock between the Semenov and Kappel groups is reported to continue. No section of the population is attached to Semenov, who was refused permission to land by the Japanese. Japan, indeed, summoned Semenov&apos;s supporters either then in Vladivostock or who might subsequently arrive, to lay down their arms. At the beginning of July a Vladivostock message reported that a Semenoff plot to overthrow the temporary Government had been discovered, and a number of semenoff&apos;s officers had been arrested. It was stated that Semenoff himself had fled to Kharbiu and that his forces were disintegrating.
The Peasant Rebellions.Western Siberia remains the theatre of sporadic peasant rebellions. There is only one disciplined anti-Bolshevik force that of General below. General PepelaiefF is in Harbin, where he has organised anti-Communist agitation amongst the Chita Government troops. Meanwhile, risings are reported under below&apos;s direction among tho Cossacks and peasants in the Cheliabinsk and Ishiina regions. The lied Army units in both areas, including the 26th Division, formerly commanded by below, went over en masse to the rebels.   The movement is spreading east of Omsk.JAPAN.The Russian population of Japan, which numbered no more than 100 before the war, has steadily increased since the revolution of 1917, and now numbers some 1,500. Suspicions of Bolshevism attach to some of these people, but no propaganda work has so far been revealed, nor are any Japanese known to be in direct communication with these Russians. There appear, however, to be indications of a crafty Bolshevik plan to cause an estrangement between America, China, and Japan, through political, diplomatic, and other means.CHINA.The Secretary to the Chinese Legation in London has been pressing Krassin for information whether the Soviet Government contemplate sending a Mission to Pekiu and whether it intends to reply to the Chinese Governments note containing definite conditions on which the Chinese Government would admit a Soviet Mission. Krassin was obliged to hedge and has somewhat irritably asked Tchitcherin to keep him acquainted with Chinese affairs so that he may at least be able to give polite answers to the Chinese.Russo-Chinese trade is reported to have re-opened locally since early last summer. The reason presumably lies in the easiness of trade between Russia and China and in the belief that revolutionary propa-ganda will be most effective after the rapprochement of the two countries. Shanghai is the Chinese centre of Bolshevist activity, which is gradually extending in all directions. Yulin would appear to be the recognised Bolshevik chief in North China and Michael Poprove to have been entrusted with propaganda work in Japan. A propaganda organisation exists formed by one Chen Chia-tin and called the Labour and Artisan Federation. It professes to work for the social salvation of Chinese labour ; actually it propagates communism and loses no opportunity of fomenting discontent and disorder.9. BRITISH COLONIES. CANADA.Communist and Revolutionary Movements.Money has been promised to the Communists by the Third Inter-national, but only on condition that they unite into one solid body. Funds will be sent through various underground channels, one being an Investigating Committee to be sent out by the various Russian Co-oper-ative Societies and Banks which are controlled, or will be controlled, by the Communists.  Diplomatic couriers will also carry funds. The promised
money would not appear to have materialised, the Central Executive Committee aud the agitators in Toronto, the centre of the movement, all being poverty stricken.In pursuance of the plea of unification, an executive body has been formed to carry on negotiations between the Communist and the United Communist Parties. This executive body consists of eight members, three Communists, three United Communists, one member of the Socialist Party of Canada, and one member of the Finnish Federation.The Pan-American Bureau formed by Martens before his departure is to be secretly in control of the Communist movement, and five provincial organisers are to be appointed in Canada, with a Press Committee of three editors to issue illegal underground papers in English, French, Yiddish, Russian, and Ukrainian. Germ cells are to be formed in all strong locals of the One Big Union, weak locals being entirely crushed. As many Communists as possible are to become members of Trade Union aud form a &quot; Caucus &quot; or germ cell in each union in order to oust all reactionary leaders and replace them by Communists. The Communists mean to capture not only the funds of the Socialist Party of Canada, but also their paper, the &quot; Western Clarion.&quot;Preparations are being made for a Communist convention for Ontario and Quebec, but members appear to regard each other with considerable suspicion. A secret committee has been formed to raise a fund to compensate Red agitators who are &quot; victimised,&quot; to print and distribute reading matter, aud to start three or four additional groups of the Communist Party. Efforts are to be made to get Communists into the Farmers&apos; Union and the National Union in Quebec and to form germ cells. The latter, which is dominated by the Roman Catholic Clergy, is considered very reactionary.A women&apos;s revolutionary organisation with headquarters in Toronto has been started. It is called the Women&apos;s Peace organisation and is said to have branches all over the Dominion and the U.S.A.The Ukrainian Communists.The discovery has recently been made of a new party known as the &quot; Ukrainian Federated Communist Party of America and Canada.&quot; This Party claims to have a membership of 8,000 in Canada, and about 900 members in Toronto. It is an &quot;underground &quot; affiliation of all Ukrainian radical societies and organisers are to be sent into every province in an effort to persuade all Ukrainians to join. Schools are to be maintained in which children are to be taught the principles of Communism. There are already five of these schools in Torouto. The Party claims to be well organised and ready for revolution, but they intend to Avait for a lead from the English speaking radicals. The latter are, however, compara-tively few, and the leaders bitterly deplore what they call the apathy of English-speaking comrades. It is said that qualified instructors might soon counter this revolutionary propaganda.The Ukrainian Labour organisation has meanwhile announced that all members of the Communist Party Avill be under the discipline of the Third International. Any member found drunk while on duty will get from three to six years&apos; hard labour, for they are liable to betray the secrets of the Communists, while all spies without exception will suffer the death penalty.Although the Ukrainian Labour Temple Society has not, as yet, adopted the platform of the Communist Party, the organisation is un-doubtedly based on Bolshevist principles. The Nationalists who were recently expelled by the radical element contemplated taking legal action
put have been advised to refrain as it was doubtful whether their case would be successful.Russian Designs.A resolution has been published by the Bolshevik Executive Com-mittee that all immigration from the U.S.A. and Canada is to cease. America being the next, country for International revolution, Soviet. Russia wishes her subjects to remain there and continue their work of spreading Communist propaganda and helping to establish Soviet rule. When they ultimately return to Russia they will be expected to give a strict account of their work.While it is thought probable that Krassin himself will confine his attentions solely to trade during his projected visit to Canada, his staff, it is believed, will be actively engaged in propaganda and fomenting disorder.The Situation in Vancouver.It has been decided by the revolutionary element in Vancouver to organise all available man power and prepare for any emergency. In the meantime the situation iu the older countries will be watched. Since the prosecution of Pritchard and others in Winnipeg speakers have been discreetly ambiguous.Recent propaganda in Vancouver has included the incitement of the unemployed to loot shops, and talk of special arguments addressed to the bourgeoisie, bank clerks, &amp;c, who are less amenable than the loggers and longshoremen.Radicals in Vancouver are reported to be considering with favour the suggestion that whenever a labour leader is imprisoned a prominent man of the capitalist class shall be kidnapped.Internal jealousies among the revolutionists are becoming very noticeable. In South Alberta and South Eastern British Columbia no signs have been detected of preparations for disorder, and little if any foreign money appears to be in circulation there. The latter report seems to be confirmed by the poverty-striken condition of the great majority of professional agitators.A proclamation has now been issued in British Columbia forbidding meetings of &quot; Reds &quot; in public places, and a by-law has been passed requiring that the Union Jack should be carried at the head of all parades. The by-law further provides that if any other flags are displayed in a parade, for each one so displayed there must be two Union Jacks.Labour Questions.Any concerted action between Labour in the Dominion and Labour in the United States seems unlikely. There appears to be some idea that the present trade depression in Canada has been deliberately brought about by American capitalists, and there is a strong and bitter feeling against American capital and what many term the &quot; Americanisation of Canada.&quot;   American labour too is viewed with considerable disfavour.There appears to be no difficulty in getting men in the lumber camps, and meu who agitate or speak openly in favour of the O.B.U. are finding it difficult to get work. The mills are working &quot;open shop,&quot; and are meeting with no opposition whatsoever.At a meeting of the Canadian National Union of Ex-Service Men held in the middle of May a communication from the Trades and Labour Council asking for co-operation in driving out oriental labour was received with hostility.
The President of the Firemen&apos;s Union and five of the Firemens Union who are on strike have been arrested on a charge of violation of the Municipal Strike and Lock-out Act. Warrants have been issued for the arrest of 20 others. The strikers have been notified by tho city authorities that drastic measures would follow any damage to city property, and men are being recruited to replace tho strikers. The strike of the police and firemen has now ended by their return to work on the municipality&apos;s terms.Some [disposition was shown by the miners to refuse to ship coal to England while the strike was on in this country.The Union of Ex-Service Men.An attempt is being made to extend the very dangerous Canadian National Union of Ex-Service Men from Vancouver to the rest of the Dominion, and the Ex Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Labour Council of Winnipeg-has announced its desire to reorganise as a branch of this association. There are rumours of some mysterious attempt made by John Kavanagh to gain funds for the poverty-striken Vaucouver section. Some obscure aud half-derelict I.W.W. fund is mentioned, but it seems probable that funds from Moscow may be the real objective. Recently one of the advocates of the Canadian National Union of Ex-Service Men urged his hearers not to be reluctant to handle Bolshevik money. Strenuous efforts to arrange a plan of campaign for next autumn or winter are being made.The Union has divided South Vancouver into &quot; zones&quot; with a captain or runner for each and an elaborate organisation to warn the members of impending action. The I.W.W. in Chicago have offered them support and co-operation for the overthrow of capital. The question of arms and poison gas has been engaging the attention of the Union, who intend to make themselves so strong that they &quot;cannot be dictated to by either civic, provincial, or federal authorities.&quot;Members of the Irish Self-Determination League of Canada have been declared eligible to serve on committees of the Union now that it is understood that Ireland&apos;s self-determination means &quot; the overthrow of &quot; capitalism and all forms of Government and the ultimate establishment &quot; of a Soviet Government in Ireland.&quot;The Irish Question.An informant who has been on an extensive tour of Canada was struck with the need for a presentation of the English view of the position in Ireland. As things stand, men who proclaim themselves loyal Britishers still volunteer the opinion that Canadians resent the treatment of the Irish at the hands of the English, whom they are accustomed to regard as indolent. They state that Canadian sympathies are with the Sinn Feiuers in so far as their effort is limited to obtain freedom to govern their own country, though they agree that for Ireland to maintain its demand for a separate Republican Government is going too far.SOUTH AFRICA.Native Unrest.Although the revolt in the region of Equatorville is virtually at an end the white population in the Congo is very disquieted at a novel movement towards black militarism. A sort of negro army, equipped with rifles and ammunition, is strong in the district of Kenshasa. American negroes employed by a local industrial firm receive a paper in which the blacks are incited to revolt.
The influence of the revolutionary Chief Masabalala has induced a number of natives to form a Governing Council, or &quot;Bunga,&quot; in the Snyklip Reserve, Humausdorp. The regulations drawn up show that these natives wish to be wholly independent of Government control, as they decreed inter alia that rates and taxes were payable to the &quot; Bunga,&quot; and that no policeman was to be permitted near the Reserve without authority from that body. The affair is now iu the hands of the Native Affairs Department.Underground work is to be undertaken among the coloured and native peoples of the country by the United Communist Party of South Africa.Miscellaneous.A secret press is reported to be used to increase the prevailing undertone of unrest among railwaymen. So far the press has not been located.One of the speakers at a meeting of the International Socialists told his hearers that the only opposition at their meetings came from members of the Fleet. However, this was gradually being overcome by pro-paganda, and at least one man-of-war now had its own &quot; shop stewards&apos; movement&quot; perfected.A rift has appeared among the Communists, a certain number of whom have refused to become incorporated in the &quot; United Communist Party of South Africa,&quot; and have styled themselves &quot; The Communist Propaganda Group.&quot; They favour aggressive tactics, and desire no association with those whose support is merely sympathetic and inactive.AUSTRALIA. The Premiers Straight Talk to Labour.Considerable excitement has been caused by the Premiers announce-ment advising the mining companies and employees to agree upon rates below the declared living wage. This advice is in reality an offence against the laAA% and Mr. Barwell says that he expects labour agitators to take proceedings. He lias, however, undertaken that employers and employees shall be fully protected, asserting that any law -which prevents many hundreds of idle workers from overcoming their misery and possibly starvation is ludicrous and unreasonable. The Premier asserts that the ea&apos;canny policy prevails in Australia to an alarming extent, and that the Labojir unions&apos; policy is to reduce the output to the standard of the least efficient worker. Industrial arbitration Avas placed upon its trial for the first time, and it was suggested that the question should come under the review of the Premiers meeting.The Labour Party re-united.The breaches betAveen the Independent Labourites and the official party were healed at the All-Australian Labour Conference, which Avas recently held in Melbourne, as both parties recognise that union is necessary for the next elections. Seven hundred thousand Unionists Avere represented at the Congress, which passed an anti-militarist resolu-tion, demanded representation of the Northern Territory, favoured a levy on all Unionists for the establishment of labour newspapers, and also asked for unemployment insurance and the endowment of motherhood. A Council of Action Avas elected to further the main object of the party, i.e.t the socialisation of industry.
A resolution of protest against the renewal of the Angld-Japanese and any other secret treaty which is purely a military treaty containing the germs of future warfare, was adopted. Outside labour there is a unanimous desire for the renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty in a form acceptable to America.The Melbourne Trades Hall Council has resolved to co-operate in the Australian Labour Party&apos;s anti-militarist campaign.The Irish Agitation.A motion concerning Ireland which was proposed in the House of Representatives by Mr. Considine, the pro-Soviet extremist, was lost by 36 votes to 9, the minority consisting of Labour members. Other Labour members refused to take part in the proceedings and remained outside the Chamber during the division. A protest against the intro-duction of topics which properly concerned the Parliament of the United Kingdom met with entire approval.An Australian who has recently returned to his own country sends a very gloomy picture of the way in which the Roman Catholic Church is being used for Sinn Fein propaganda, French and English priests are being replaced by extreme Sinn Fein Irish priests, and children are being taught in their school a virulent hatred of England. Loyal Roman Catholics greatly resent this, but seem powerless to alter it, as the machinery of the church appears to be iu the hands of the Sinn Feiners.Miscellaneous.In order to help the unemployed in Sydney the Trades Hall has decided to send a deputation to the French and Belgian Consuls, offering to send workmen to France or Belgium, if work could be found for them in rebuilding the ruined cities. The same people recently applied to the Federal Government for a ship to take them to Russia.NEW ZEALAND. The Commercial and Financial Depression.The position of the country is at present very unhappy. The main industries are suffering a greater depression than has been experienced since the bad times of the late eighties and early nineties of the last century. Public works are being stopped wholesale, retrenchment is taking place in public services, and the Government is cutting expenses in every possible way. There is no money, and next year&apos;s revenue is unlikely to equal last year&apos;s. Labour has lost caste in New Zealand through its taking as models the Bolsheviks instead of holding the balance of power in the House of Representatives, and is now but a paltry handful. Only if the Labour Party has the political sense to refrain from the use,of the strike and the &quot; go-slow &quot; policy is there any chance of its recovering lost ground.The Labour Position.The present system of organisation of labour into trade unions is viewed with disfavour by a large section of the community, and at a recent conference in Wellington of influential producers from all parts of the Dominion a unanimous motion was carried urging the Government to legislate in order to deprive the Arbitration Court of the power of granting preference to Unionists.The Watersiders&apos; Federation has accepted the employers&apos; offer of \d. per hour bonus made in December last, and the waterfront strike
is therefore at an end. Tho industrial agreement entered into between the two parties regarding wages and conditions of labour has been reaffirmed, and a commission to inquire into tho method of employment of waterside labour is under consideration by the Government.A conference has been arranged between employers and coalminers to consider the demands made by the latter for inclusion in the next agreement which is to replace the agreement which terminated on March 31st. The miners threatened a general strike in the event ot their conditions being refused. The course of events in Great Britain has been closely watched, the feeling being that if the Miners&apos; Federation with its strong organisation failed no other union is likely to succeed.A Communist Party coming.Several convictions have been obtained against persons circulating&apos; seditious literature throughout the Dominion, but now steps are being taken to form a Communist Party of New Zealand. So far the Labour Extremist Party has not attempted to carry out an organised programme for the overthrow of constitutional government, but has contented itself with establishing a &quot;Workers&apos; School of Social Science&quot; in order to fit the workers to take the power into their own bauds and overthrow the Capitalist Government.WEST INDIES.In spite of the unofficial reports which have been received that wages have been greatly reduced and that emigrants are being used as strike breakers the exodus of unskilled and agricultural labourers to Cuba continues.It appears evident from the perusal of the &quot; official documents&quot; of the original local representatives (self-appointed) of the Universal Negro Association that most of the money collected by these ignorant people and forwarded to the offices of the Black Star Line in New York for shares in the Company has been diverted into the pockets of various officials who decline to account for it, and that there is a systematic fleecing of the West Indian negro.10. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. The Labour Position.In the annual report of the American Federation of Labour the number of strikes in 1920 is estimated at 1,635 against 1,255 for the previous year. The organisation has lost 172,000 of its 4,078,000 members during the past year. The report urges war against the &quot;open shop&quot; policy. Mr. Gompers has been re-elected President of the Federation in spite of the attempt of the extremists to displace him.The Federation upheld its executive^ repudiation of the International Federation of Trades Unions by an overwhelming vote and adopted, amid confusion and turmoil, a report condemning the Russian Soviet regime as an enemy of labour, which was destroying self-government and imposing a vicious tyranny. A resolution opposing universal compulsory military training was passed.It is thought probable that a cut of 12 per cent, will be accepted by all the railway unions in view of the reduced cost of living. An adverse vote, however, has been given by Chicago railway-shop employees. It is feared that only a lock-out will bring the miners to take a reasonable view of the situation.   Great reserves of coal have already been stored
for the winter and it is impossible to sell at the rates necessary to sustain the miners&apos; demands. The miners rely on their contracts made when the cost of living was at its maximum ; the owners say that those must be revised.The shipping strike has at last been brought to an end by a vote of the local firemen and sailors&apos; unions in favour of returning to work.Confronted with the announcement that the directors of the American Manganese Company at Dunbar, Pennsylvania, intended to clo;,e their works on. July 1st, the men, realising that it was better to work for less pay than not to work at all, offered to accept a wage cut of 40 per cent, provided the Company kept the plant in operation. Not only did the directors agree to this, but in return they reduced the rents of their employees&apos; houses 40 per cent. The shopkeepers of Dunbar in emulation of this good example have decided to reduce the price of all necessaries.It is reliably reported that $100,000 has been contributed by Charlie Chaplin towards the Million Dollar Strike Fund of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers. The contribution is said to have been made by 10 different people, who each handed in over $10,000. It is also said that he gave $10,000 to the &quot; Liberator &quot; some months ago when he was in New York, and was very friendly with Max Eastman.The Russian Soviet and its Agitators.Reports have been circulated that the Russian Soviet is planning to send many agitators through England to the United States, the trade agreement with England facilitating the passage of Russians through that country. A considerable drift of undesirables to the United States from Russia through Poland and the Baltic States and directly from those States is also reported. The element which is leaving is discon-tentcd, unsuccessful, radical, and predominantly Jewish. It is well established that Polish and Russian Jews are undesirable immigrants. One of the 33 questions put to intending visitors to the United States puts, however, an easy check upon revolutionary undesirables. The question asks Avhether immigrants are in favour of overthrowing the Government of the United States or any other Government by force, or advocating such courses. Those who sign l&apos;No&quot; and are afterwards found airing subversive opinions are put into jail and then deported, not for their freedom of tongue or pen, but for having made a false declaration.A delegation of American workmen has passed through Berlin en route for Moscow accompanied by two American journalists. The object of their journey is to study the situation in Soviet Russia in order to give an objective opinion to the American Government as to Avhetlier it is worth while or not to conclude a commercial agreement with the Soviet Government. The services of skilled railwaymen in America are also to be offered to the Soviet Government in order to restore railway transport in Russia.Litvinoff has, however, informed Krassin that the Soviet cannot permit the arrival of the journalist Bitty and the kinema operator. Regarding journalists, the Soviet has in future to be informed which papers they represent, whether they have ever been in Russia, and whether they speak Russian. Short biographical notes are also to be provided.Haywood and Crosby, representatives of the I.W.W., arrived in Russia some time ago, bound for the Congress of the Third Inter-national. It appears that during April Janowski, a representative of the Central Committee of the Third International, met certain I.W.W. leaders at Chicago, and asked them whether the I.W.W. would be
prepared to carry out Third International propaganda in Europe as well as in America. The proposal was accepted after tho Russian Communist Party had agreed to pay all expenses. Representatives were then sent to Moscow, ami it was also decided to send agents to tho United Kingdom and to other European countries.   .The Pilgrimage of Senator France.Senator France of Maryland, who has for a long time advocated the establishment of normal relations with the Soviet Government, has been refused a permit to enter Russia. So, too, has Mr. William Johnson, president of the American International Association of Machinists. The latter, who was going to Russia on behalf of his organisation, is an active pro-Bolshevik inside the Gompers Federation. It is suspected that his exclusion from Russia is due to the presence there of William Hay wood.Tho main object of the intended visit of Senator France was to save Mrs. Harris, a fact of which the Soviet was aware. LitvinofF asked Krassin to do all he could to dissuade the Senator from his journey to Russia, hut Krassin considered it a mistake to refuse a permit of entry: &quot; With minimum exertions on your part for a courteous reception he will give a favourable report in America.&quot; Krassin was later asked to tell Senator France, without the slightest compunction, that the time for investigating and nosing round Russia had passed, and it was now time to talk business.The Irish Agitation.A decided reaction against Sinn Feiu has set in, chiefly through the growing disgust on the part of the average American citizen that the country should be constantly disturbed and exploited by what the majority of the people consider a matter primarily of British domestic policy. Mr. J. H. Thomas. M.P., lost no chance of assuring Americans that while England is prepared to give Ireland the fullest measure of self-government, she will not in any circumstances yield to the separatists and asks Americans how &apos;*if we at home cannot solve the problem of Ireland let me ask how do you, 3,000 miles away, expect to solve it ?&quot;The decision of the Resolutions Committee of the American Federation of Labour to substitute another resolution for that introduced by Irish sympathisers was the occasion for a bitter discussion. The new resolu-tion ignored the effort to initiate a boycott against British manufacturers&apos; imports aud merely asked the Convention to reaffirm its sympathy with Ireland. The following day the Irish sympathisers were overwhelmingly defeated when they asked for a reversal of Mr. Gompers&apos; ruling.A large number of machine guns of the latest type and ammunition were seized by the Customs Authorities at New York on a steamer destined for Ireland. These guns were hoisted aboard in bags marked &quot; engine room supplies.&quot;Miscellaneous.A number of the members of the United Communist Party of New York have been arrested and a private code seized in addition to their books.One of the first sections of the by-laws of the I.W.W. provides that &quot; no working man or woman shall be excluded from membership because of creed or colour,&quot; aud in this way all coloured workers are placed on a footing of absolute equality with white men.Organised reprisals are threatened by returned soldiers against any members of the Socialists who attempt to raise the red flag on their platforms.   One hundred ex-soldiers wearing their war medals recently
invaded the Socialist Convention at Detroit, and announced to tho meeting through their spokesman that there is only one Hag in the United States, and that&apos;s the Stars aud Stripes.&quot;An effort is being made by the Naval Secretary, Mr. Denby, to cure the growing tendency to introduce Soviet methods into tho American Navy. Two commanding officers who permitted the crews of naval vessels to vote, in one case on questions of discipline and in the other to decide where the ship should dock, have been removed from their commands. Votes of this nature which were formerly permitted are now declared to be contrary to law and discipline.11. CENTRAL AMERICAN STATES. MEXICO.An Uneasy Situation.It is evident that the Bolsheviks are growing bolder., A revolu-tiouary spirit is steadily rising, and it is feared that serious disorders may break out before long. There has already been a clash between Socialists and religiously disposed inhabitants of the capital of the State of Michoacan which resulted in many deaths. A few days previously Bolsheviks had forced their way info some of the churches, above which they raised the Soviet emblem, and in which they committed sacrilegious excesses. On Labour Day the Bolshevik flag was flown over the cathedral as well as the Town Hall of San Angel. The Bolshevik flag has, in fact, beeu adopted as the emblem of the labour unions.It is generally believed that the President is losing any grip he may have had on the situation, and is giving up the control of affairs to Calles and de la Huerta, both of whom are strongly imbued with the spirit of Bolshevism and too inexperienced for the positions they hold. A protest has been presented to the President signed by a large number of senators and deputies in consequence of the invasion of the House of Deputies recently by a large group of Socialists. After drawing atten-tion to the Presidents own sympathy with these extremists, the memorial recommeuded that both Calles and Huerta should be dismissed from the Cabinet. In the press the removal of the Legislative Powers to the city of Queretaro has been threatened unless Congress is adequately protected.The President, however, has at last taken steps to restrict extremist activities, and some ten of the most pernicious agitators of foreign nationality have been expelled, while agents of the Government have been directed to attend meetings of the labour unions and to report provocative speakers. The extremist agitators have been exploiting the lack of employment to foment trouble among the labouring classes. The I.W.W. organisation is strengthening the influence which it obtained during the war, and the confederated labour unions are being directed by dangerous extremists, who are laying plans with a view to establishing a Soviet administration in Mexico. The plans of these people to manu-facture explosives have already been mentioned. It is not unlikely that their lack of union, courage, and funds will ruin their plans for revolution when things are put t) the test.It is feared that the prevalent unrest may increase when Congress fulfils its promise and undertakes to issue the Labour Law based on Article 123 of the Constitution. It is generally believed that the new law will grant to workmen a share in the profits of all industrial enter-prises.  It may be noted in this connection that more than 90 per cent.
of the industries of Mexico represent foreign capital and management. When the serious defects of Mexican character, especially marked among the ignorant classes, are taken into consideration, it may well be that a compulsory distribution of profits will provoke a situation calling for diplomatic protests by foreign Governments.The Agrarian Laws.The results of putting the Agrarian Laws info operation has already caused a somewhat serious situation. The best portions of estates, especially of estates that have been hitherto well worked, have been taken away from the former owners in order to be given to tho Indians.The Governor of Jalisco appears to be bent upon the subdivision of all estates, large or small. It is doubtful whether the Indians will actually benefit, but there is no doubt that glaring favouritism is being shown to persons other than Indians who are being put into possession of the land thus vacated. Hacendados are afraid to sow crops and foretell starvation and misery as the result of this law. The Indians who have been put into possession have neither knowledge nor capital with which to effect shipments of products.12. SOUTH AMERICAN STATES. ARGENTINE.Early in June a general strike was declared by the Maritime Workers1 Federation and the large union known as the Argentine Regional Federa-tion of Workmen as a protest against the Governments decision to protect non-union labour in the port. The response to this order was particularly partial and the movement has proved a failure. Energetic measures were taken by the Government; the headquarters of the Mari-fcimo Workers&apos; Federation were closed and several union leaders and agitators were arrested. The strike ended within two or three days and the Maritime Workers&apos; Federation returned to work.At a secret reunion of the International Communists it was decided to address a petition to the President for the official recognition of the Soviet Government of Russia and all its representatives and for the establishment of trade and commercial relations between Russia and the Argentine.BOLIVIA.The Government has discovered what if believes to be a revolutionary conspiracy and has arrested several officers among other ringleaders.BRITISH GUIANA.No Bolshevik agitation or unrest is reported in the Colony, and the under current of feeling on the colour question which was so strong a year ago has apparently disappeared. The East Indian League, which threatened troubled on the sugar estates, has broken up through the failure of its leaders to agree as to policy. The Labour Union, while it appeals to colour prejudice, conducts its propaganda iu an orderly manner and is more interested in wages than politics. It is backed by the leading negrophiles of the colony.CHILE.At a moment where there is almost complete stagnation of the freight market and when shipping companies and trading concerns generally are faced with a serious situation, the exigencies of the ships&apos; crews and
port labourers are becoming exorbitant. Unfortunately their use of the successive strike has the tacit support of the new Government, which usually intervenes and grants concessions to the workers, through the nominal agency of Courts of Arbitration (where the Government delegate has the deciding vote). At times these strikes have nothing whatever to do with the companies concerned and are purely political. The Com-panies have been forced to omit certain ports where the perpetual strikes have given rise to enormous losses. In others they have declared a lock-out until the workers come to a saner frame of mind. The Minister of the Interior requested tho Valparaiso Association of Merchants to refrain from taking any drastic action until he had investigated matters. But no notice was taken of the Association^ request for the removal of paid agitators and the annulling of the decree establishing the system known as the &quot; lietlondilla&quot; (a Federation list from Which workmen are supplied by the Federation irrespective of their merits), under which the employers are rendered practically powerless to control or dismiss em-ployees. In defiance of the efforts to produce industrial peace the workers at Iquique declared a general strike merely to await the result of the municipal elections. In the circumstances the shipping companies consider that their only alternative is to put into effect a general lock-out.Inquiry has been made by the Antofagasta Courts into the attack of the workmen on the San Gregorio Nitrate Qficiua at the beginning of this year. The loss of life whioh followed was largely attributed to the action of labour agitators, amongst whom Senor Recabarreu was prominent. The Courts have found that a large measure of responsibility attaches to Senor Recabarren and have recommended that application should be made to the Chamber to waive his privilege as Deputy and to allow him to be tried by the ordinary tribunals. The Socialist press is very indignant at this action, which is approved by all moderate-minded persons.Iu connexion with the trial of certain members of the Valparaiso branch of the I.W.W. the judge of first instance has now decided that the. I.W.W. is an illegal association and has condemned eight of the accused to various terms of imprisonment. An appeal has, however, been lodged, and the case will be carried to the Supreme Court.O   15382
PART II1. THE THIRD INTERNATIONAL AND THE BRITISH COLONIES.Plans for propaganda in British Colonies, and primarily East Africa, were laid in Moscow at a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Third International in January last. The letter which follows addressed by Karl Iiadek to the Comrades of the Communist Parly in Great Britain (jives a conspectus of Communist aims in this regard.Communique&quot; No. 01574 to the Comrades of the Communist Party of Great Britain.&quot; Comrades,&quot; On the 12th and 14th January, 1921, an Extraordinary Meeting of the Executive Committee of the Third International, with represen-tatives of the All-Russian Soviets and with delegates of different revolutionary Committees, was held in Moscow. Comrade Radek, as president, opened the meeting with a speech in which he explained that the meeting had been called to deal with revolutionary propaganda, in the different countries of Europe and the East, as also in the English Colonies.&quot; Comrade Radek indicated that the moment had come for the Third International to exert all its strength to prove its influence not only in Europe but also in the Far and Near East; should this not happen the Third International would have to be declared bankrupt. We must not lose a moment in taking measures to make evident to England, principally England, that our influence is great and that our ideas to fashion a Communist order in the world are founded, not upon dry ground, but on actualities. The past has already taught us to be practical in our work and we have therefore come to the conclusion that if we do not exert an influence upon English Imperialism, English Imperialism will press in upon Soviet Russia and choke the revolution which was brought about with the blood and bodies of our Comrades. The Executive Com-mittee of the Third International has therefore decided at one of its last meetings that a definite plan should be worked out in our meeting to-day and that we should lay down in detail Iioav revolutionary propaganda is actually to be carried out in the English Colonies. I therefore urge the Comrades present at to-day&apos;s meeting to help us to bring our Avork to fruition.&quot;&quot; A discussion followed Comrade Radek&apos;s speech in which Comrades Bukharin, Dzeijinsky, Kameneff, Jorgensen aud others took part. The trend of the speeches shows that Radek&apos;s motion regarding revolutionary propaganda in different parts of the world was to apply specially to the British Empire, In the first place as a warning to England against Avhom it Avould be a protest for its unAvorthy dealings with the Soviet Government and its attempts to obtain a footing iu Soviet Russia (German very faulty precise meaning uncertain), and secondly as a proof for certain parties in the Soviet Government that the Third Inter-national Avould not desist from continued revolutionary action.&quot; Comrade Radek then further explained that the Executive Com-mittee of the Third International, having some time since obtained diverse proposals concerning the manner in Avhich revolutionary propa-ganda should be carried out in South and East Africa, these countries
being propitious ground for the work on account of the mixture of black and white population, had decided that a plan of revolutionary action should be compiled from these different proposals. Comrade Radek made a technical proposal, founded upon proposals received from England, that about 50 persons (experienced agitators ?) should be sent to Africa to begin the work forthwith.&quot; Since the Comrades destined to carry out the work in English Colonies were, however, sure to encounter difficulties on their way from Russia to the place specified, it might be advisable to ask the English, American aud German Comrades to indicate to the Executive Committee of the Third International which persons could be transported to undertake the work in Africa and how they could be taken there.&quot;After a short discussion in which all present took part, Dzerjinsky&apos;s motion was accepted that the following appeal should be addressed to the English Communist Party :&quot; Comrades, the Russian Executive Committee, together with some delegates of All-russian Revolutionary Soviets, assembled in Moscow on the 12th January, has decided that you should help us in carrying out our work in pursuance of the above given memorandum of our sitting. At the same time we are empowered to inform you that it would be desirable that a number of our best comrades in England, to whom revolutionary work could be entrusted, should be sent to East Africa, in order immediately to begin the work for the projected revolution. We draw your attention particularly to our commencing our revolutionary work in the English Colonies with East Africa. We are in fact informed that conditions in that country are most favourable to carry the work to a successful issue. We therefore beg you that if you are willing to send a party of Comrades to the districts named below, that the persons there sent should be absolutely trustworthy and preferably English citizens. As for Russian citizens sent there, it would be desirable, if possible, that they should travel with English passports to minimise suspicion.&quot; In the course of the coming months a portion of our trustworthy Comrades will arrive in England, specially empowered and suitably provided with means, and we ask you to help these Comrades to attain the desired end. We draw your attention to the fact that we have already a number of excellent Comrades in Cape Town who will go further afield from there to carry out the revolutionary work. In the course of a short time you will be informed regarding Comrades Jaworsky, Robert Wyllie and Henry Anderson, who are now in Cape Town and will shortly be proceeding respectively to Mombasa, Zanzibar and Bangamaio.&quot; We hope in the course of the coming six months that with your help we shall be able to convey the desired number of persons into the different parts of Africa, which we will indicate in a communique shortly to be issued.&quot;At the same time we inform you that there will arrive, in all probability very soon, in London, the American Comrade Haywood, and some Lettish comrades with extraordinary powers from our Executive Committee, and to them we will deliver further details about our plans in Africa and in other English Colonies where we desire to prepare the soil for the coming revolution. We ask you, as the opportunity presents, to inform us whether you have duly received our communique of to-day and at the same time to let us have, if possible, a short survey of your activities since your last communique No. 852 of 15th November 1920.&quot;For the All-Russian International Executive Committee.(Signed)     Kakl Radek.
2. THE THIRD INTERNATIONAL MILITANT.An important communication, dated the 7th May, from the depart-ment of Western European Propaganda of tlie Central Committee of the Third International, to the Western European Secretariat in Berlin, has been obtained.The document explains that the Third International is devoting its attention mainly to countries in the East, where natives are struggling against European rule. At first all efforts were directed towards exploiting Pan-Islamism, through the medium of the Angora Government. This was successful up to a certain point, in weakening the Treaty of Sevres and shaking the stability of the Entente ; but Angora has wearied of its &quot; role of Red advance guard,&quot; and is &quot; at an end as a fighting centre for the Rod staff in the East.&quot; Consequently, &quot; new fighting bases&quot; in Egypt and in Tudia are necessary; and the writers proceed to show how the national movements in those countries are to be exploited to bring about the overthrow of the British Empire, which &quot; remains the same dangerous enemy to Soviet Russia and to the Third International as it always has been.&quot; A. successful rising in Egypt is to be the signal for setting the &quot; whole Mahommedan world ablaze.&quot; Bolshevik efforts in that country are to be devoted mainly to the Nile Delta and the Suez Canal area; Moscow cannot give much material assistance, but the Communist nuclei can support the rising ; and the Western representatives can assist through communications established via Marseilles, Messina, and Crete.In conclusion, it is laid down that English public opinion can only be influenced by threatening the Empire&apos;s vital points, India and Egypt.3. RUSSIAN EMIGRES IN JUGO-SLAVIA.The following translation of a document shows the attitude of some representative Russian emigres in Jugo-Slavia towards the Trade Agreement, and the ignorance of what England did for Russia during the ivar even among Russians who have been in a public position.It also raises the interesting question of&quot; re-insurance &quot; with the former landowners on the part of big capital in its re-invasion of Soviet Russia : the suggested means of such re-insurance to be advances to the landlords on the security of their title deeds. Many Russian ex-landlords believe, and can, they profess, shoio proof, that after the &quot; inevitable &quot; fall of the Bolshevik Government the peasants by their own wish will return a certain percentage of their landed estate, on receipt of a deed from their ex landlord confirming them in the lands they have seized.It is interesting to note that this policy of &quot; re-insurance &quot; is now being applied by the Dresdner Bank as regards the ex-owners of &quot; nationalised&quot; industrial enterprises.As a result of economic causes, into which it is unnecessary to go in these notes, the British Government has concluded a Commercial Treaty with the Bolsheviks. It is already becoming increasingly ciear that no benefits, either economical or political, will accrue to England from this Treaty.1. Neither grain nor raw material are to be obtained from Russia under the present regime.2. As regards concessions, if such be obtained it would be necessary to sink -a vast amount of capital without the possibility of receiving a
return earlier than in .10 to 15 years (thanks to the destruction of the Transport and Economic systems in Bolshevik Russia).Moreover, a period of 10 or 15 years cannot he counted on. Bolshe-vismis already shaken aud will fall when, no man can say hut certainly before 15 years.No new Russian Government, whether it be from the Extreme Eight or the Extreme Left, will recognise, under any circumstances, a treaty concluded with the Bolsheviks.On this question not only are the emigrant circles, without regard to Party, entirely solid, but also the population of interior Russia.Thus at best the economic results of the Anglo-Bolshevik agreements amount to nothing. But politically there is a risk that the results will be worse than negative.The mere fact of having concluded a trade agreement with the Bolsheviks has roused (rightly or wrongly is outside the scope of these notes), but it has roused the hostility of every Russian in non-Bolshevik circles.The opinions of emigrants can be judged by scanning the proceedings of the Economic Council of Russian Traders in Paris, and also the Emigrant Press.In Russia itself, the population (although unable from the very fact of being in Russia to express an opinion) felt the Anglo-Bolshevik agreement eveu more deeply than those outside Russia.From the above-mentioned facts it can be seen that the relationship between England and Russia (not temporary, transient &quot;Russia of the Bolsheviks, but the Russia of the future) stands at the cross roads.It is highly desirable to direct the steps of both countries along a path mutually beneficial to both, otherwise Russia will fall, logically and inevitably, under the exclusive economical, and therefore political, control of Germany.What will happen when, sooner or later, the Bolsheviks fall ?The new Government (of whatever complexion it may be) having repudiated the Bolshevik Agreements will be forced to seek capital abroad.It will be compelled (regardless of its personal sympathies or anti-pathies) to follow the feelings of the mass of the population. This feeling will be Germanophile because at the present minute Germany is showing the greatest political foresight. Germany also has entered into an agreement with the Bolsheviks in order to take such present advan-tages as she can and she has used these advantages principally to penetrate Russia and make herself strong there in good time. But at the same time Germany has got control of those anti-Bolshevik organisa-tioiis, which, in her opinion, are going to be important iu the future.Every German agent in Russia tries to assist the population against Communist oppression by whatever private means he can. As a result Russians are grateful to the Germans and put their hope in them.The knowledge that it was the German himself who introduced Bolshevism into Russia becomes of less and less account. It is under-stood (that it was a means to the end of weakening an enemy much the same as poison gas.If England wishes-in any measure whatever to prevent the German subjugation of Russia it is absolutely necessary for her to begin to operate in two spheres.1. The Psychological.By making clear to the Russians (particularly the emigrants) that England does not regard Russia, now half dead, as a hunting ground for
this or that commercial advantage. Unfortunatoly nothing has been done in this direction on the part of the English.Nevertheless the method of doing so is simple enough, it is this :  Publish in the emigrant press details of what England has done in the past for Russia and Russians, and give the reasons why England has entered lately into the trade agreement with the Bolsheviks. The effects of such an announcement would be great, even in Russia itself. Russians would get to know what is either not known at all by the mass or known so incorrectly that much suspicion has ensued.II. The Practical.Get into close and direct touch with the Russian emigrants (not with individual leaders of political parties and not with the parties themselves). That as a first step.Be it understood that the aim of such a rapprochement must be honest and above board. Help to the Russians in their difficult position, emphatically not by means of charity, but help on a business basis advantageous to both sides.There are several methods of arriving at the object in view ; take one of them.The great majority (sic) of Russian emigrants&apos; have property, business concerns, or landed estates in Russia.At tho present moment these emigrants are leading a miserable existence abroad ; such help as they receive is by way of charity. Could not a group of financiers be formed in England with the object not of buying out the Russian emigrant owners, but of advancing loans on those properties legal possession of which can be proved by deeds and documents.The moral aspect of the proposal is sound because it could not be said that the English Avere taking advantage of the situation to buy interests cheap, on the contrary, the English Avould be looked upon as benefactors, helping the Russians to develop their resources with English and not German money. England would then gain a large number of loyal supporters, materially and morally indebted to her.With the assistance of such supporters England would be in a position greatly to extend her economic activities in the Russia of the future, not only in connection with the properties already subsidised, but in new directions.In conclusion it must be remembered that these are merely notes intended to outline a method by Avhich those interested in furthering a better understanding between England and Russia may begin to work.Such a method is feasible at present, but the initiative lies entirely Avith the English. Facts and figures can be obtained (that indeed is all the Russians can do).In the event of such a plan ever being seriously considered there are a considerable number of reliable Russians of ability ready to assist with the necessary information and statistics.(Signed)     Serge Constantinovitch Kerbet.

4. THE NEW ORDER.A recent letter from Preobajenski, assistant secretary to the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party, to Reich, the propaganda agent for the same organisation in Berlin, is a curious commentary on affairs in Russia.&quot;Greetings, old Comrade,&quot;I am availing myself of an opportunity and am sending you this letter with a trustworthy person, whom you probably remember from the old times of our emigrant activities abroad. I am not sending the letter by courier bag as I have not the slightest desire that our friendly correspondence should be digested and weighed up by Dzerjinsky&apos;s valets. Do you know, Ylya Lvovich, that these gentlemen are as abhorrent and repulsive to me and many of our mutual friends as the Blue&apos;9, army of the bulwarks of the Tsarist throne. During your last visit to Moscow you had tho opportunity of meeting only the first offspring of this new generation of watchdogs, and even then, you remember, we discussed them and came to the conclusion that these new &apos; buds &apos; of the revolutionary tree when they bloom will not surpass in every way the old Tsarist &apos;Okhrana&apos; (Secret Police).&quot;I am rather inclined to think that in every revolutionary organisation there sits a gendarme, who sooner or later crawls out. The first example we see in Burtzev, the second in Dzerjinsky. He has many good qualities, but he has also one fault, which is particularly noticeable lately  he is continually trying to find counter-revolution everywhere. Having collected his staff of old Tsarist police spies, he first of all has instructed them to spy on all of us.&quot; Everything here is as of old, I am talking about the party. Squabbles, party gossip, and quarrels are continuing, and the party activities are somehow or other &apos; carrying on.&apos;k&apos; Our younger generation is completely demoralised and is concerned only with careerism, looking for soft jobs all over Russia, having rolled up aud put away into a dusty corner the old party banner. They have all become great administrators, but the resultB of their administration are very poor. 1 am inclined to believe that if for another year they are allowed to rule Russia, she will be overgrown with weeds and wild shrubs, there will be literally no roads or means of communication left, and it will be impossible to tempt any foreigners from the East or West to come to us, whatever concessions or mountains of gold you promise them.&quot; Our older comrades realise this perfectly well and are trying hard to find some means to restrain the administrative temperament of our young hooligans. Our affairs are not very bright. At present I am in a very pessimistic mood as T have just returned from a two months&apos; tour of the provinces, where I was sent to inspect our party organisations and the local administration and report on them. Well, I can tell you that there were nine of us sent out on this job aud each one brought back the same conclusion that under such an administration as Russia has at present, her future is dark and uncertain, and there are no hopes for improvement. Yes, my old thing, friends are very bad, everybody has become so bureaucratic, so conceited, that we old party workers are not even allowed to speak at our meetings. I am sorry to confess it, but we are approaching degeneration. The Soviet of People&apos;s Commissaries and our older comrades on the Central Committee have something up their sleeve, are preparing for something, and it appears very soon* The Tsarist gendarmerie or political police wore bright blue uniforms.
enormous changes will take place not only in the Central Government but also in the provincial administration. Of course it is quite easy to change and replace individuals, but there is really nobody to put in the places of those that are to go. The workers are uneducated and unprecedented-parod, the &apos; experts&apos; are still at their policy of sabotage, and the sloppy provincial intellectual or simply the man in the street, who for genera-tions has been trained not to live but merely to exist, has to-day quite lost his head from all our revolutionary squabbles and quarrels and does not bother about anything but finding a piece of bread somewhere.&quot; One, naturally, of course, in these circumstances begins to look to the West where the most enterprising of our intellectuals have escaped, have settled down and, I believe, have preserved their remnants of knowledge and energy for useful work. I believe that sooner or later we shall have to face this problem very seriously, as with the forces at our disposal in Russia we are totally unable to do anything. The&apos; return to Russia from the West of this enormous White brigade will mean cou-siderable, real and practical help. By the way, I heard recently from Lunacharsky that he intends to invite back to Soviet Russia many of our best writers, painters and actors who have been dispersed by the revolution all over the world. He intends first of all to invite tli9. Moscow Art Theatre to return, guaranteeing to the whole company a complete amnesty and non-punishment. I hope, Ylya Lvovich, that you will help Lunacharsky in this his task.Yours,Preohajenski,&quot;Printed, by Eyrb and Spoehswoodb, ltd., East Harding Street, E.0; *.
