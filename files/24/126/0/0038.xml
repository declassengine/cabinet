This Docimibnu is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.SECRET.CP. 3137.CABINET.THE GOVERNMENTS NAVAL POLICY.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.A SERIOUS position has arisen in connection with the naval programme, already approved and announced by the Government, which calls for the immediate attention of the Cabinet.In my Memorandum &quot; Explanatory of the Naval Estimates,&quot; which was presented to Parliament on the 12th March, the previously declared naval policy of the Government, &quot; to maintain the Fleet at a strength not inferior to that of any other Power,&quot; was definitely reaffirmed, and it was announced that the Admiralty, &quot; recognising to the full the necessity for reducing expenditure to the lowest limits compatible with national security, have effected drastic economies and agreed to assume risks which, in ordinary circumstances, they would regard as difficult to reconcile with the full maintenance of the &apos; one-Power standard.&apos; &quot; A summary of the proposed reductions was then given, with the intimation that they were &quot; dictated, almost entirely, by the pressing need for economy,&quot; and it was added, as a corollary and a condition, that, &quot;as the Fleet is. reduced in numbers, the ships of which it is composed must be of up-to-date type and of the highest efficiency.&quot;In pursuance of this policy it was explained to Parliament that four new capital ships, embodying the lessons of Jutland, would be laid down this year to replace obsolete ships which were being relegated to the disposal list.The Memorandum went on to say &quot;It cannot be too strongly emphasised that, in making this long-delayed beginning with the replacement of obsolete ships, the Government neither commits itself to, nor contemplates, any building &apos; Programmes&apos; in answer to those of any other Power. Indeed, it trusts that it maybe possible, as a result of frank and friendly discussion with the principal naval Powers, to avoid anything approaching to competitive building, either now or in the future. But, meanwhile, it would be a dereliction of duty on the part of the Admiralty to allow the efficiency, training, or morale of the Royal Navy to deteriorate through neglect to provide it with materiel which is equal to the best and in which it can feel confidence. It is also imperative to avoid an irrevocable loss of time and building facilities which might make it impossible to main-tain our sea security if it should be threatened.&quot;This policy was approved in principle by the House of Commons on the 17th March, with the understanding that its details could be discussed, later, on the the Shipbuilding Vote.On the strength of this approval, and in good faith, the Admiralty proceeded to effect the promised, but conditional, reductions in the Fleet. They have further, with Treasury sanction, incurred the necessary preliminary expenditure, and. taken all customary steps towards starting the construction of these ships this autumn. They have, moreover, reaffirmed to Parliament on numerous occasions, and announced to the Imperial Conference, that this programme stands and will be proceeded with.Now, however and this is the point at issue-the Treasury declines to sanction any further expenditure, and proposes that &quot; the whole question of the construction of[6621]
these ships should be considered by the Cabinet in the light of the financial position.&quot; Pending such reconsideration, the Treasury refuses even to discuss the form of building contract submitted by the Admiralty.The result is a complete deadlock, which can only be solved by a Cabinet decision.This being the position, and in view of the very grave considerations involved, I feel it my duty to submit to my colleagues the following observations: The Government is deeply pledged to Parliament, the Country and the Empire to maintain the &quot; one-Power standard.&quot;This standard is already seriously challenged, and unless the British navy is provided with modern and up-to-date capital ships it must inevitably sink to the third place, i.e.t below both the United States and Japan, by the year 1925.The gravity of the present position is sufficiently indicated by the following facts and figures.No new capital ships for the Royal Navy have been built since 1916, and at the present moment (since the launch of the light cruiser &quot; Efiingham&quot; on the 8th June), there is not a single warship of any description on the slips in this country.With the solitary exception of the battle-cruiser &quot; Hood,&quot; the Navy therefore possesses no capital ship which embodies the vital and momentous lessons of Jutland, which battle revealed that all ships designed before that date are liable to instant and complete destruction by the exposure of their magazines to the new developments of shell-fire. This being the case, it is imperative, if the morale and fighting efficiency of the Fleet are to be maintained, that it should be provided with ships that are free from these grave defects and in which the Navy can feel confidence.A satisfactory design has now been evolved, after four years of research and experiment, audit is this type of &quot;replacement&quot; ship with which the Admiralty desires to proceed without further delay.Meanwhile, other countries have not stood still, and, taking advantage of the knowledge and experience which the British Navy itself gained at great cost of blood and treasure-and placed at the disposal of its Allies during the war, both the United States and Japan are building, and are well advanced with, new battle-fleets embodying the latest lessons of the war.These foreign programmes, unlike ours, are not merely projects, and their state of progress is sufficiently indicated by the following tables : First-Glass Capital Ships.

These credits are available to the Executive independently of any future action by the Diet.Compared with the above, as already stated, the British. -Navy possesses, at present, only one first-class capital ship (the &quot; Hood&quot;) and even when the four projected ships of thisyear&apos;s programme are completed (early in 1925) would have only five to America&apos;s twelve^and Japan&apos;s eight. By no stretch of the imagination, if we do nothing more, could this be called maintaining the Governments declared policy &quot;that our Navy should not be inferior in strength to that of any other Power,&quot; nor is it possible to drop our &quot;replacement&quot; programme without breaking faith with, both the country and the Empire.It is, of course, unfortunate that this, question should have arisen just at the moment when an International Conference to discuss reduction of armaments is under contemplation, and much play can be made with the query, &quot;Is this the time to commence building battleships, and should we not at least wait until the result of the Conference is known ? &quot;I can understand, and even sympathise with, the impulse which prompts such an enquiry, but the hard fact remains that the American and Japanese building programmes are already well advanced, are being pushed with all speed, and are not going to stop in anticipation of the Conference. Meanwhile Great Britain alone, of the three Powers concerned, has set a practical example, and given a substantial lead in the limitation of naval armaments, by the heavy reductions in ships, men and money which were approved last March.If, in addition to this, we alone stop building we shall enter the Conference stripped naked, so to speak, and with our future position hopelessly and permanently prejudiced. Assume, for example, that the proposal were made and agreed to at the Conference that no more capital ships should be laid down from that moment by any of the contracting Powers, or, at any rate, that only already approved building programmes should be proceeded with. Such a proposition would be difficult to resist, and yet, if accepted, it would relegate us permanently to the third place and put both America and Japan for twenty years-in a position, without fighting, to dictate to us diplomatically.Under such circumstances our prestige would be fatally injured and the Empire, as *a community of free nations linked together by the seas and sea-power, would disintegrate and cease to exist.This is a contingency which, I cannot believe, we are yet forced to contemplate, however black the financial position may at the moment appear. Nor is it one, I am convinced, to which either this country or the Empire will yield if the issue is placed fairly and squarely before them. But the decision must be taken now in order that, if we can no longer afford to preserve our Empire or  the sea-power upon which it
depends, we should make confession of that fact before the Imperial Conference closes and be prepared to face the consequences.In any case, the issue will be forced when vote 8 of the Navy Estimates comes up for discussion in the House of Commons, as it must do very shortly. I understand it is already being pressed for.For these reasons I feel bound to ask for an immediate decision by the Cabinet.July 15, 1921.L of F.
