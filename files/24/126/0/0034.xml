(StlS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 01? HIS BRITANNIC MAJBSTFS GOVERNMENT).CONFIDENT! AIi,CP. 3133,CABINET. HDtiSlKS policy,3AMENDED DRAFT STATEMENT 0.1? THE MINISTER Off HEALTH.(As agreed at Conference of Ministers held July 13th 1921 at 5,30 p.m*)The number of houses built, building, and contained in approvedtenders under the housing scheme for local authorities and public utilitysooieties is now about 176,000,    Under the scheme of subsidy to private builders the number of houses built or to be built is estimated afc aboutf 23,000. . The annual cost &quot;to the State under the looal authorities andpublic utility societies is about  10,000,000 per annum and the amountI required for payment of subsidies to private builders is about  5,000,000In view of the immense difficulties confronting the nation during and after the war the Government think that they have no reason to bedissatisfied with the scale of their contribution to the housing prob-&amp; lem - a contribution, notwithstanding the grave embarrassments of the war,without precedent in our history.      The Government is under its housingschemes performing at great cost a work of supremo national importance which private enterprise could not carry out.    At the present timo thehouses which are being built or are to be built under the Governmenthousing scheme will utilise all available labour for at least twelvemoaths including a considerable number of ex-service men to, be absorbed in the industry,-    By the end of twelve months conditions may have changed very greatly, prices may be stabilised and the considerationsvcgop which Government aotion should be based may be fundamentally4itered.    Reconsideration is moreover imperative when regard is paidtorthe present financial condition of the country,    Very grave finan-oial difficulties will confront the nation for the remainder of thepresent and throughout the next financial year owing to the unparalleledpd world-wide Repression in trade and the unfortunate industrial^roubles which have so seriously-affected both expenditure and revenue.
. The Government Oaavo..eccoTdingly *oecided that, for the time being at any rate, the following limitation,Jnuat be placed on housing expenditure.&apos;    The number of houses to be constructed by local authorities&quot;and public utility societies with Government assistance under the present scheme will be limited to 176,000, that being the number built, building, or for which tenders have been approved, and assistance will not be given under the scheme in respect of any houses in excess of that number.     It would appear that on a final examination of the present approved tenders some adjustments will be possible to meet cases of hardship with-out exceeding this total.All expenditure in connection with the housi^sf schemes which has already been incurred by local authorities with the approval of the Ministry of Health will rank for financial assistance under the present scheme, which limits the liability of local authorities to the produce of a penny rate, and where work undertaken by local authorities with the approval of the Ministry of Health cannot for reasons outside the control of the authorities be completed by July 1928, the time for completion will be extended by the Ministry as may be necessary.As regards the scheme of subsidy to private builders, thepowers taken under the recent Act will be exercised to the extentof making payment in full for houses completed within the four months after the expiration of the previous Act, i.e., by April23rd last, and additional houses will be sibsidised only if l)egunbefore the 1st July under a certificate or the promise by a. localauthority of a certificate.      There will be eases in whick;commitments have been entered into, although construction haV\uotactually been begun, in anticipation of the continuance of the *subsidy.     In order to meet these cases I shall, in the exerciseof my discretion, pay subsidy where commitments have been;enteredweeksinto if work is started within sixmrod&amp;g of the present &amp;ate.
The GoYeraira:nt...rec^ fl^ of making whatimprovements are possible uncler present JTinancdal.^ircra3ns1;disturbances in slum areasa      To this end they are prepared to provide an annual contribution not exceeding  200,000 towards the deficiency on local authorities&apos; accounts for the improvement of slum areas.This annual contribution will continue for the whole term of such loans as may have to he raised by local authorities to defray the necessary expenditure.It is the intention of the Government to keep the housing problem closely under review.   They fully recognise the importance of that problem from the point of view of tho health and social conditions of the people hut it is impossible to incur greater commitmsnts than our finances will allows2, Whitehall Gardens^ S.W0 July 14th, 1981,
