GENERAL.With the settlement of the coal dispute a more optimistic feeling prevails with regard to a general revival in trade. The position in the iron and steel industry and in the metal trades generally so far remains unchanged, but discharges from the shipbuilding yards have increased, and very few orders are at present in hand. The settlement of the wages dispute in the cotton trade has given general satisfaction, and, as soon as coal is available, a considerable revival of business is anticipated in this industry. There is also a prospect of improvement in the lace trade, and both the hosiery and boot and shoe industries are fairly busy. Employment in the fishing industry has somewhat improved, and the arrival of coal supplies from outcrop workings has enabled a number of workpeople in the pottery industry to resume work.II. EMERGENCY WORK.As announced by the Prime Minister on the 19th October, certain schemes have been put in hand by the Local Authorities in conjunction with the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Health,- and by the Local Authorities themselves, designed to secure work for unemployed men, preferentially ex-Service men. The following is the result at this date: (a.) New Arterial Roads.20.405 men employed up to date (in and around London, 3,224: Provinces, 17,181).(b.) Road Maintenance.It is estimated that employment has been provided for approximately 20,000 men over and above those ordinarily so employed.(c.) Housing^ (Acceleration of the Lay-Out of Roads and Sewers and Approved Housing Schemes).Men employed up to the 24th June, 2,715 (in and around London, 220; Provinces, 2,495).(d.j Lord St. Davids&apos; Committee.Men employed on work other than the above up to the 24th June, 31,808 (in and around London, 4,540; Provinces, 27,268).(e.) Alternative Work in Government Establishments.War Office establishments: men employed up to the 25th June, 2,769 (in and around London, 2,070; Provinces 699).Alternative work provided in Admiralty establishments: men employed up to the 25th June, 6,301 (in and around London, nil; Provinces, 6,301).(f.) Short-time in Government Establishments.Number of men who have found employment up to date as a result of the intro-duction of short-time system. Men employed up to the 25th June: War Office estab-lishments, 1,980 (in and around London, 1,844; Provinces, 136) ; Admiralty estab-lishments, 2,915 (in and around London, 187; Provinces, 2,728).(g.) Emergency Work found by Local Authorities.Total number of men employed up to&quot; the 24th June, 8,645 (in and around London, 2,467; Provinces, 6,178).Total labour employed on above schemes ^ 97,538....&quot;...!, &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; .   &apos; .  ,    .........As reports for the week ended the 24th June have been received from only 396 Local Authorities out of 420- who were asked to furnish information, it is probable that the Relief Schemes which have been inaugurated by the Government and Local Authorities are finding employment for a number of men in excess of the figures given. ,[6549]
III. 50,000 EX-SERYICE MEN TO BE TRAINED IN THE BUILDINGINDUSTRY.The industrial stagnation caused by the coal stoppage, and the consequent uncertainty of the outlook, have seriously interfered with the progress of this scheme. The employers, however, have set up District Committees in many of the more important industrial centres, and it is understood that they wijl shortly be posting notices on all jobs advising their workpeople that the job is only open to men willing to work with and assist in the training of ex-Service men taken on under the scheme. This action has already been taken in London by the Master Builders and also by the Office of Works.In addition steps are being taken to make it clear that contracts for building and constructional work in which the Government is financially interested will in general be confined to contractors who are employing men under the conditions of the scheme.In the meantime, the total applications are 19,536. In the London and South-Eastern Division 8,295 men have applied, and the following are figures for other Divisions: South Midlands and Eastern Counties, 1,381; South-Western Counties, 1,805; West Midlands, 1,944; Yorkshire and East Midlands, 1,643; North-Western Counties, 2,506; Northern Division, 552; Scotland, 1,147; Wales, 263.IY.
