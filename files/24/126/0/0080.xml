This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,    566SECRET.CP. 3178. yoTHE CABINET.IRISH -SITUATION.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.There are several matters which I think require immediate consideration by the     79 Cabinet, in case the present negotiations with the Sinn Fein leaders break down. Irlsh1. I have already asked that some substantial guarantee should be obtained that,     775 if the present conversations fail in their object of obtaining peace, we shall be given at least 24 hours&apos; notice before the end of the truce.2. The terms of the announcement of the imposition of Martial Law upon the 26 Southern Counties of Ireland need to be considered and approved. A draft, No. III., has been prepared by the Irish Situation Committee and is in the possession of the Cabinet Secretariat.Definite authority is required to issue the Proclamation of Martial Law and for the other measures mentioned in the memorandum on the expiration of the truce.3. In the event of Martial Law being declared throughout Southern Ireland, it is proposed to institute a system of permits for passengers travelling to and from the Martial Law area, and preparations are being made in conjunction with the Home Office.   Before proceeding further, however, it is necessary to be assured (a.) That the institution of these blockade measures are definitely sanctioned bythe Cabinet, should the present negotiations fail; (b.) That the six Northern Counties of Ireland are willing to co-operate in thescheme, and to control the traffic to and from the ports within their area, . and movements and traffic between the Northern Counties and the rest ofIreland; and(c.) That the Navy will definitely assist in the blockade.4. The questions regarding the internment of Irish rebels have been stated in my previous Memoranda, CP. 2996, 3082, 3082a and 3164.Decisions are required (i.) that the War Office should be responsible for feeding and guarding internees placed in civil prisons; (ii.) that the Admiralty should be responsible for internees at Scapa and Osea Island, and that they should take over and make ready these camps.5. The General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, the Forces in Ireland, has submitted that, should the negotiations fail, it will be necessary to move all families of officers and other ranks from Ireland. If no settlement is reached, the conditions in Ireland will be those of active service, and the presence of women and children will be dangerous. General Macready recommends that the evacuation should take place as soon as possible, and will notify the numbers of the families of other ranks for whom WT accommodation will have to be provided.  Authority is asked accordingly.6. General Macready reports that in the South of Ireland the population is being imbued, through the Press and in other ways, with the idea that the Irish Republican Army is triumphant, and the liaison officials of the latter are, in some cases, refusing to take notice of communications not addressed to them in their &quot;army&quot; rank. This is a matter in which compromise is impossible, since if any communication from one of our Army officials is couched in language recognizing the Irish Republican Army in any way, the fact will be used as a proof that they are belligerents and not rebels. The general attitude of the Sinn Fein officials renders the position very difficult.General Macready adds that Martial Law cannot be abrogated entirely, since all persons undergoing sentences of Military Courts would then be automatically released, and, further, he presumes that an Act of Indemnity is necessary at the same moment as the removal of Martial Law. &apos;L. W.-E.The War Office, 29^ July, 1921.(B2L/272)  100  7/21  H&amp;S, Ltd.  9362wo
