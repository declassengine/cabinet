IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S OOVEFNMFMT).REPORT BY THE GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING-IN-CHIEF ON THE SITUATION IN IRELAND FOR W ENDING   30th July, 1921.(Circulated by the Secretary of State for War).1. QENSRAL SITUATION*   The general situation In Ireland is, that the agreement has been kept and that there have been few serious outrages during the period under review.   It is difficult however to forecast the future and to know whether the terms offered to Mr. de Valera are likely to be accepted or rejected, quite apart from what those terras may actually be.   These difficulties are found partly in the complexities of the Irish character which include their visionary and impractical outlook on political problems, their capacity for practical organisation and their intensely materialistic, almost sordid, outlook on ever-;day matters. It is not easy to calculate how the first of these characteristics may overcome the last and induce them to grasp at a shadow when the substance is within their reach.Another factor \ftiich makes it difficult to see how they will act in present circumstances is their fundamental ignorance of the English character.    They have boasted so much of their victory over England that many really believe that they can successfully demand any terms and they do not realise that there is a certain point beyond which public opinion In Great Britain will not allow any Government to be forced end that that point has very nearly been reached.Finally much of the information received is tainted.    For instance letters from internment camps are carefully censored fromP. 3196.CABINET.E C R &apos;  T.
within and the brave words about I.R.A. determination to continue the struggle are worth nothing seeing that they are closely scrutinised before they are sent out and are written by men most of whom will continue the struggle from the comparative luxury and absolute safety of the camps.    Oil ihe other hand in Ballykinlar Camp an attempt has been made since July 11th. to effect the escape of 20 men vide para. 3 below.    This attempt, however, was frustrated just before the tunnel was completed.The Propaganda Campaign is continued with great vigour.    It Is aimed at emphasising the &quot;Victory^ and stiffening the discipline and raising the moral and eSjprtt de corps of the I.R.A.    It is perhaps significant that there is little or no mention of a republic though there is much repetition of the comfortable but nebulous phrase &quot;free natural self-determination&quot;.    The reasons for this propaganda are hot difficult to find.    A united front by all shades of opinion in Sinn Fein Is essential in present circum-stsnces and it Is evident that the leaders of I.R.A. are determined o do all they can to maintain discipline, even at the cost of self-determination, since discipline will be desirable if the terms of the Government are accepted and essential if they are refused, when an Immediate resumption of hostilities by the extremists must be expected.    Moreover they cannot be anxious at the [enthusiasm with which peace has been received throughout the Country and they have in some cases taken steps to damp down the ejoicings of the people.    They know too that there are many who Ire nervous about the possible activities of the Crown Forces in ase of a resumption of hostilities and who look forward to a enewal of a life &quot;on the run&quot; with its attendant risks and Increased discomforts during the winter months with such dislike hat thev will not willingly respond to the call of their leaders.The extremists are anxious.    At the moment many of them jave no position to which they can return and a cessation of
hostilities would perhaps leave them without employment.    At the moment they do not appear to he looking for regular work partly for obvious reasons and possibly because from an employer&apos;s point of view they would not be entirely satisfactory.     Propaganda there-fore is necessary to soothe any anxieties they may feel.A most determined -and organized attempt is being made to show that the cessation of military action by the Grown Forces is tantamount to a recognition of the I.R.A, as a belligerent force. The &quot;Liaison&quot; officers, most of whom have sprung from comparative obscurity, and of whom one at least has signed a declaration to the effect that he has never had anything to do with the I.R.A. are now all Commandants I.R.A. and some of them have actually refused to Continue their functions because the military authorities of the Crown Forces have steadily refused to recognise their military status.     It is not clear indeed that their leaders have realised what would be the effeot of our admitting the belligerent status of the I.R.A. and of Insistence on a rigid adherence to the Laws and Customs of war.Finally there are a certain number among all classes md sections who are genuinely afrals lest they should be deceived &quot;once again&quot; and induced to accept anything under a misapprehension.2. ACTIVITIES OF THE I.R.A.There have been a certain number of cases where the I.R.A. have demanded free food and. lodging and more where they have committed minor outrages to collect money and stores.Their main activities have been in the direction of reorganiz-ing their various units and in taking such steps as they can to stimulate recruiting.    In some areas they have conscripted all men and boys between the ages of 15 and 50, but this does not appear to be general throughout Ireland.
All railways havo now been repaired, but the I.H.A. have not allowed the repair of roads and bridges except where their destruction was inconvenient to the public.There have also beer, a good many cases of drilling and a certain number of searching for arms.3&apos; ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE PROM BALLYKINLAR INTERACTT CAMP *On the 27th July, in consequence of information received, a search wag made at Ballykinlar Internment Camp and revealed the existence of a cleverly constructed tunnel some 215 feet long leading under both the obstacles surrounding the camp.     This tunnel has been under construction for probably five or six weeks, and there is evidence to show that an escape of at least 20 of the most important Internees was planned for the night of Monday 1st./2nd. August.Evidence exists that Joseph McGrath, who was conveniently released at the instance of the Government on July 24th, has, since his release, been in consultation with Michael Collins regarding the selection, for escape by this tunnel, of those internees who would bo most valuable to the I.R.A. in the event of hostilities being recommenced.4, JUDGMENT OP THE MASTER OF THE ROLLS..Last month counsel for two men, Egan and Higgins,the former sentenced to death for carrying ammunition and the latter for taking part in the Clonmult ambush, applied to the Right Hon. (Jharles O^onnor, Master of the Rolls in the High Court ot Dublin, for a writ of Habeas Corpus, which has been granted, although previous similar applications to the High Court of the King*s Bench in Dublin had been refused by a fuD. bench on the ground that it had been established that a state of war exists justifying Martial Law.
Seeing that such action on the part of a civil Judge was at variance, not only with the Judgment of the King&apos;a Bench, but also with the established Army practice by which it is understood that the officer administering Martial Law (which is no Law) ia responsible only to the House of Commons to whom he looks for indemnity to cover all such acts as he considered It was neces-ary for him to take, I directed my subordinate officers to ignore the action of the Master of the Rolls.lhere&quot; upon a writ of attachment v/as issued by the Master of the Rolls against myself and subordinates concerned.    I again directed that no notice should be taken of this writ.The situation will have to be cleared up as it affects the powers of the British Army all over the world and as ragards Ireland, if one Irish Judge, contrary to the judgment of his colleagues, can make a decision of this nature, the position is one of grave importance.(Sgd)   C.F.N. Macready.General, Commanding-in-Chief, IRELAND.2nd August. 1921.
