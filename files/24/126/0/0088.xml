(C.P.3159)Note by the President of the Board of Education.I cordially welcome Lord Chelmsfordf8 Report and am prepared to give effect to it.As regards paragraph 16, some difficulty may possibly %      arise (the removal of which will require legislation) if the Board of Education mates it a condition of approving the pro-posals of Local Education Authorities to exercise their powers under the Choice of Employment Act that they shall undertake Unemployment Insurance work for the Ministry of Labour;    I thfcnk the Cabinet might be well advised in adopting the Report to qualify it by directing that effect should be given to paragraph 16 in the first instance eo far as possible without legislation.I have no doubt whatever that I may count upon the co-operation of the Ministry of Labour in overcoming any adminis-trative difficulties that may arise in giving effeot to the Report.(Sgd.)
