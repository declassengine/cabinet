ITHIS &quot;DOCUMENT .LS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BHITAMIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT),CP. 3 00,C A B 1 I 1 T./NEGOTIATIONS FOR .A :TBEATY &apos;BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENTS OF INDIA AID-AFGHANISTAN.The attached tele grain from the Viceroy of India dated August 3rd, 1921, ^as considered at the Meeting of the Cabinet held at 12 noon -on -August 5th, 1981 (Cabinet 63 (Si), Conclusion 1.),.(Sgd)   MA, HANKS T.Secretary to the Cab met.2 Whitehall Gardens,, .8.W. 6th August 1931.
From Vl-eroy, 3rd August 1021. 8276\1 Waived 41rtli, 9 a.m.)Clear the line.1.877 S. Secret. Afghanistan.   Following from Dobbs, 229 C, of 1st August:-&quot; It seems unlikely that H:p-;u has already agreed to drop Eastern Consulates, and if it comes to renewed discus^ku of pis aller it is practically certain that Afghans will revert to their original portion, viz., that - they cannot promise elimination of Eastern Consulates without guarantee from us against Russian aggression over that question. They will again refuse to propound question to Russia until they have received guarantee.&quot;To postpone decision on this point,-as your telegram proposes, means that I shall not, even at this late hour, have final and clear policy to put to the Afghans which they must accept or reject, hul that most vital point which we know will be raised will be left uncertain and subject to further reference to London. I fear that this will put me in a very unpleasant position. Another uncertainty in Govern-ment of India&apos;s proposals is contained in the ambiguous sentence; &apos; He should insist on disclosure of Soviet Treaty, but should take his stand solely on the expunging of Consulates.&apos; Does this mean that I am to make the disclosure of treaty with Russia sine qua non or not ? -I confess that I do not entirely share forebodings of the Government of India regarding our position. Everything in Russian and Afghan attitude, which I can gather here and from secret papers, points to their being much more afraid of us than we of them. Abdul Hadi has specially reported, as you know, that Russians greatly fear us, and recent events in Russia can only increase their consciousness of weakness. Afghans were excited a fortnight ago by the belief that Greeks had been beaten and that Kamalists would seize Constantinople. They are now in corre-sponding state of collapse, and received with extraordinary meekness very plain speaking, almost amounting to rudeness, in which I indulged at last meeting. Frontier, other than Waziristan, seems quieter than it has been for years, in spite of famine troubles (? and omitted) rumoured aerial raids. Fact that the Afghans of Ningrahar are flouting Governors orders, and insisting on working on the Khyber Railway, considered together with attack(s) by tribesmen on Afghan regiment at Hazarnao, is very significant. My impression is that all our tribesmen are tired of Afghan promises and will not easily be stirred up by them again. Tarsi has himself confessed that the whole of opposing tribesmen might quite as probably attack Afghans as British, and has asked whether we can give guarantee against this. There is renewed trouble in Khost between tribesmen and Afghan Government, and much discontent with the authorities along-whole tract between Kandahar and Farah. Tarsi and other representative Afghans have several times lately admitted that in Afghanistan (sic) agitators are a broken reed on which they cannot rely. Thus I still think there is a chance of Afghans accepting exclusive policy, or something near it, if I push it home with apparent determination to break with them in default of it. I shall, in accordance with the instructions contained in your telegram of the 13th May last, 1684 S., continue to press for exclusive policy, with every possible demonstration of unyielding purpose, up to the eleventh hour, and shall then, if it appears hopeless, try to induce Afghans to propound pis aller, or, in last resort, myself execute volte face with what grace I may. I hope that Afghan communication promised for 3rd August or 4th August may make whole situation clearer, but I am confined to bed and may not be able to attend meetings as early as that.&quot;We are relieved that Dobbs now thinks that there is still a chance of Afghans accepting exclusive policy or some (&apos;? tiling omitted) like it. But position is so critical, and, in case of Afghan rejection of our exclusive treaty, decisive action so necessary, that we shall be glad of His Majesty&apos;s Governments orders as soon as possible on our recommendations on pis aller,In the sentence which Dobbs finds ambiguous, we meant to recommend (1) that disclosure of Soviet Treaty should be insisted upon as a sine qua non; (2) that while provision regarding the gift of money, arms, &amp;c, from Russians should be admitted, debarring of Eastern Consulates should be definitely provided for in our treaty as in present draft. Of course, should Soviet Treaty prove to contain some hitherto un-disclosed article that is definitely anti-British, Dobbs should challenge it at once, and report for orders.
.As regards limited assurance against&quot;Russian aggression, we are still averse from giving it. We find, it difficult to believe that Afghans in the altered circumstances would really want it from bond-fide motives. It seams more probable that if they still demand it their real object will be to secure either a document with which they could make mischief between Russia and ourselves, qr else j&apos;? omission) from us that Russian aggression over the, consulates is a serious-confiagency in order to base on that admission a demand for arms in advance. Howevetf, as Dobbs; is the best judge of; what is at the back of their minds, and as .he, is raturally anxious to. have everything&apos; clean-cut beforehand, we think he should be given discretion to grant or refuse limited assurance if the Afghans press forgone.We do not think that over much stress shouK be laid on Hazarnao incident (of which no account has reached us from Khybei) or the reported trouble with the Afghan authorities in Khost and south-western A afghanistan. Such trouble is endemic in Dotanni, nor do we attach undue importance to fact that, in existing famine conditions in Ningrahar, economic stress is proving more potent than prohibition of local Governor. ... .        . - * - . .
