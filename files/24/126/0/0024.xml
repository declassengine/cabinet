This document is the property ol His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.SECRET.!*0CP. 3124.THE CABINET.POSITION IN ANATOLIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate the following appreciation of the position in Anatolia, in accordance with the request of the Committee on the future of Constantinople (3rd Conclusions, 4(a) and (6).)L. W. E.llth July, 1921.Secretary of State,In accordance with the wishes of the Cabinet, I put up a short appreciation on the Greek Army and the chances of Greek successes in the coming operations. This appreciation is, to my mind, quite unsatisfactory, but it is the best we can do at the moment. It is unsatisfactory because we are unable to compare the two contending armies and therefore our forecast may be wholly misleading. I am sorry for this, but as I cannot send officers to report on the Turkish Army I can only do the best possible within the limited information at my disposal.Henry Wilson, Field-Marshal,Chief of the Imperial General Staff.7th July, 1921.AN APPRECIATION OF THE VALUE OF THE GREEK ARMY. 1. The object of this paper is : (a.) To appreciate the value of the Greek Army, on the hypothesis that it isfighting alone and unsupported, as is the case at the present time.(See paragraphs 2-8.) (6.) To appreciate the value of the Greek Army, on the hypothesis that it isfighting with Allied support in the form of munitions, war materiel and money.   (See paragraphs 9-10.) (c.) To give particulars of the assistance in the form of munitions and war materielwhich could be supplied, if His Majesty&apos;s Government decided to helpGreece.   (See paragraph 11.)2. In order to obtain the latest information on the subject, two senior officers, Major-General T. 0. Marden, C.B., C.M.G., and Colonel E. S. Hoare Nairne, C.B., C.M.G., were ordered, in accordance with the instructions of His Majesty&apos;s Government, to make independent reports, as the result of personal observation, on the present condition of the Greek Army in Anatolia. Their reports are attached as appendices to this paper, together with the observations on each by Lieut.-General Sir C. H. Harington, K.C.B., D.S.O., Commanding-in-Chief, the British Army in Constantinople, as follows : Report by Colonel Nairne       ...      ...      Appendix A.General Haringtons comments ...      ... B. 1, 2 and 3Report of General Marden      ...      ... ,,      C. 1, 2 and general Haringtons comments...      ... ,,      D.3. It is evident from these reports that the Greek Army must be regarded as well-trained, well-equipped, and eager for battle.   It would appear that the Greek General
Staff have taken steps to remedy the causes of recent failures, and although certain weak points exist, it is probable that the Army, in so far as its size permits, will give a good account of itself, at any rate in the initial stages of the operations which are about to commence.4. It is unfortunate that we are unable to secure similar reports on the present condition of the Turkish Nationalist Army, as it is only by comparing the condition of the opposing armies that we can predict the probable outcome of future operations. The evidence of recent operations, supplemented by reports from British, French, Italian and Greek sources, leaves no possibility of doubt that the Nationalist Army has been greatly expanded during the past few months, and that its training has been methodical and efficient. Furthermore, great quantities of arms, ammunition and military stores have been received from Russia, and there are indications that Russia is prepared to help with man-power also if the Russophil Government of Mustapha Kemal will accept it. Tchicherins visit to Angora at this moment is of special interest in this connection.5. The first paragraph of Appendix C 1, and the fifth paragraph of Appendix C 2, contain the Greek estimate of the Turkish Nationalist forces. This estimate agrees with our information as to Nationalist divisions in actual contact with the Greeks, but takes no account of Turkish forces in reserve. If Turkish divisions in close reserve are taken into account, as they should be, the relative superiority in infantry of three to two, which is claimed by the Greeks, disappears altogether; while the relative superiority in guns of more than two to one is not borne out by the information at our disposal, as will be seen from the following tables : (a.)

Even if we were to accept the Greek estimate that they have a superiority of three to two in infantry, we consider that this superiority is altogether too small for the task in hand. It may be quoted as a fact that, during the Great War, even the British Army did not succeed in defeating the Turks in prepared positions, except when we had considerable numerical superiority. By skilful grouping of units within the battle area, the Greeks may contrive to concentrate great superiority at certain points, and may thereby gain local successes, but no possibility of a great victory can be envisaged. If great local successes are to be gained when numbers are so nearly equal, superiority of leadership is necessary, and we have no reason to believe that Turkish leadership is inferior to that of the Greeks.G. If we consider the moral factor in the opposing armies, we find nothing to indicate an advantage on the side of the Greeks. Both armies are convinced that their cause is just, both armies are eager for battle, both armies are inspired with a hatred of their opponents ; but the Greek Army cannot ha\e altogether outlived the depressing effect of their failure in the April operations, and this will be accentuated when the facts become known concerning their forced and undignified retirement from Ismid. Added to this, there is the under-current of political intrigue inherent in the Greek Army, which must have a bad effect on morale. The Turks, on the other hand, appear to be actuated by a single purpose, and recent success will have heightened their morale.7. Attention is specially drawn to the latter half of Appendix C 3, in which General Marden gives his appreciation of the value of the Greek. Army as a whole. The opinions therein expressed, except in so far as they give the Greek estimate&apos;of the Turkish Army, agree very closely with the opinion formed by the General Staff, as the result of reports received during the last few months.The plan of operations which the Greeks are about to put into effect is one which demands intimate co-operation, and independent action by subordinates, These have hitherto been two of the weakest points in Greek tactics. As regards co-operation, General Marden considers that &quot; means of communication between detached forces are not sufficient.&apos;&quot;&apos; As regards independent action by subordinates, he says : &quot; The units themselves will probably save the situation.&quot; The General Staff are of opinion that the Greeks are leaving much, to chance,8. The General Staff are, therefore, of opinion that, although it is possible that the Greek Army, fighting alone and unsupported, may obtain some initial success in the operations which are about to commence, they see no prospect of any decisive victory being gained which would bring peace to Anatolia.9. It must next be considered whether Allied support to Greece, in the form of munitions, war materiel and money, would enable her to bring about peace in the Near East. It is evident that without Allied support in munitions, war materiel and money, the Greek operations cannot be continued indefinitely. It is also evident that Allied support of this nature will be of no avail unless we are sure that the Greek Army is in all other respects capable of the task which it has been given by the Greek Government. Fighting so far from their base, Smyrna, in a country where transport is extremely difficult, they are, according to their own figures, able to maintain on the battle front only 51,500 rifles, although they have about 200,000 men in the country. These numbers are insufficient to give them a sufficient margin of superiority to command success. It is, therefore, man-power that is their greatest need. If they succeed in dislodging the Turks from their present positions, the Turks will almost certainly retire and continue the war further east. It will then be necessary for the Greeks to fight with still longer and increasingly vulnerable lines of communication, which will make, a still greater demand on Greek man-power, a demand which, so far as we are informed, Greece is not in a position to meet.L0. It would, therefore, appear that no good purpose would be served in supplying Greece with munitions, war materiel and money unless we are in a position to prevent similar supplies being received by the Nationalist Turks from Russia. If the Allies are prepared to munition the Greeks, and at the same time to prevent the Turks from obtaining munitions, a time may come when the Greeks, if they do not grow war weary, would be in a winning position. The General Staff, however, see no way of cutting off the supply of munitions to the Turks from Russia, and are, therefore, of opinion that Greece&apos;s great need is man-power rather than munitions, war materiel and money, and that as the Allies are not prepared to render assistance to Greece in this form, no support in munitions, war materiel and money would enable the Greeks.to win peace in Anatolia,11. As regards particulars of the assistance in munitions and war materiel which could be made available if His Majesty&apos;s Government were to decide to support the
Greeks, the Army Council have received no list of Greek requirements later than that dated August, 1920, a copy of which is attached as Appendix E. It is not known to what extent this list represents the present needs of the Greek Army, but it is known that many of the items mentioned, such as horses, mechanical transport vehicles, clothing, &amp;c, have already been purchased in the open market. As regards armament, we could supply the rifles, rifle ammunition, hand grenades and 60-pr. batteries. We could also supply a portion of the engineer materiel and technical material, and most of the medical materiel asked for; but it is impracticable to compile a table showing what is available until the Greek requirements are known.General Staff,War Office,London, S.W.6th July, 1921.APPENDIX A.REPORT ON GREEK ARMY BY BRITISH MILITARY ATTACHE, ATHENS.Telegram No. 93, dated loth June, 1921.In Ushak region British Military Representative and I stayed at 1st Army Corps and 2nd Division Headquarters and visited various troops of 2nd and 5th Divisions. We saw many details and spoke to officers at railway stations on xhe way. Bad weather limited opportunity, but I saw quite enough to disprove pessimistic statements of French military mission and others in Athens.The following report is based on information given by Colonel Pallis, Chief of the General Staff, Asia Minor, heads of bureaux, and 1st Army Corps and 2nd Division staffs, checked by my own and British Military Representative^ observations. There is probably some optimism but no serious exaggeration : General Condition. -The Greek Army is now a more efficient fighting machine than I have ever seen it. Cessation of foreign supplies has enforced careful admini-stration. The failure of last March taught folly of inadequate arrangements. Hard facts have quenched antagonistic (group undecipherable) and political bigotry, hard work has created reliance. Troops are well clothed and shod, camps neat (group undecipherable) communication improved though means are lacking, advanced units being systematically formed, transport reorganized and sufficient for immediate requirements. Troops are fairly well trained and staff work co-ordinated. Of those troops I have seen moiale and discipline are excellent. Troops and staff are confident and keen to meet Nationalists. Morale of 3rd Army Corps declined after retirement last April but recovered, Chief of the General Staff says, when reinforcements arrived and is now good.Present admirable morale throughout the Army is founded on confident hope of winning final settlement of Asia Minor strife. If these operations, however successful, do not bring about settlement and army has to remain another winter in the field, morale will be severely strained. The King by his presence, or even influence, might be able to maintain it, but no one else could.Command and staff. General Papoulas seems to be a figurehead, but he supports his staff who serve him well and so he inspires confidence.Colonel Pallis is a good Chief of General Staff, quiet and practical.Colonel Saryannis, Deputy Chief of the General Staff, is brilliant arid energetic and is the driving power at Army Headquarters.First and artillery bureaux are well run.Second bureau weak and needs shaking up.Head of third bureau does not impress me, but he has been recently appointed and British Military Representative says work has been well done hitherto.Fourth bureau excellent. Its head, Colonel Spiridon, served under M. Venizelos and has energetic personality and administrative talent. He has overcome great difficulties and is doing first-rate work.Evidence here and at the front shows that the medical service has been considerably improved.Seeing that the morale is maintained, I agree with Pallis that, balancing losses and gains the army has benefited on the whole by the last eight months&apos; changes in the
command. New commanders of the 2nd. and 3rd Army Corps are greatly superior to the old. Removal of General Nider from the 1st Army Corps, and of Tsoroulis from the 7th Division is a great loss, but Pallis declares their health necessitated it. Perhaps Niders successor is not brilliant, but he appears to be sound and reliable. General Valettas, commander of the 2nd Division, is said to be brilliant. He appears to me to be well above the average, and he showed courage and decision during the April operations. In the crd Army Corps, Tricoupis. of the 3rd Division, is a great asset; Platis, commander of 7th Division, is the weak horse in the coach. Leonardopoulos, late commander of 10th Division, is to supersede a Royalist commander of 9th Division, which Leonardopoulos formerly commanded under Venizelos. The other commanders of formations I have not met. Pallis says they are capable and have experience, except Colonel Dimaras, who is new to command of a division. Prince Andrew is to command 12th Division.I have seen Army Headquarters, 1st Army Corps and 2nd Division staffs. British Military Representative knows the 3rd Army Corps and 3rd Division staffs. If their quality is maintained in the other formations the army is well staffed. 1st Army Corps staff is very good throughout; 2nd Division and 3rd Army Corps average ; 3rd Division very good.   Greek staff work hard, but need firm hand when things go wrong.Commanders of units did well in last operations, but Royalist officers were naturally not so good at handling their men in action as those who had fought in Macedonia. Fortunately, large majority of junior Venizelist officers have remained, and Royalist officers with Balkan war experience now have had time to relearn their work. On the whole, I think command and staff of army and army itself considerably improved since last year, and, judged by Balkan standards, very efficient. I cannot imagine the Turks developing so good a machine without extensive foreign help.Composition of Army. Asia Minor army consists of 11 divisions in 3 army corps, 1 cavalry brigade, 2 regiments of army troops, and line of communication troops, including 5 special battalions. For operations which begin about 3rd July, Army Headquarters of 1st Army Corps, with 1st, 2nd and 12th Divisions, 2nd Army Corps, with 5th and 13th Divisions, will be in Ushak area. 3rd Army Corps, with 3rd, 7th, 10th and 11th Divisions, will be in Brussa area. 4th and 9th Divisions will be in reserve.Exclusive of sick total strength in Asia Minor, June 14th, was 169,000. Add 11,000 for 12th Division and 20,000 for 1912 Class, still to come from Greece, then total before (? operations) will be 200,000. After completing units there will be in army corps depot in Asia Minor 17,000 available for replacement of casualties. Number of 20,000 still expected from Greece may be optimistic, but in any case total represents a far better result of recent mobilization than I estimated.Infantry.  Rifie companies, 160 rifles, exclusive of light machine guns. Machine gun companies generally complete.Cavalry brigade. Useless horses have been excluded and replaced by requisition. General Staff estimate of 1,000 sabres plus machine guns probably correct. Nicolaides, a good officer, has been re-appointed to command.   Divisional cavalry complete.Artillery, All divisions are complete or completing, except 4th, which will have only one group. Army corps complete, except 3rd, which has only seven batteries and a country cart ammunition column.Arms and ammunitions. All fighting troops armed with Mannlicher rifles, except 7th Division, which has Lebel. Light machine guns and St. Etien heavy machine guns take Lebel ammunition, other heavy machine guns take Mannlicher. Rounds now in Asia Minor per gun or rifle are : Mannlicher rifle, 900 ; machine gun, 25,000 : good further supply available from Athens factory. Lebel rifle, 400; light machine gun, 4,000; heavy. 25,000; no reserve in Greece, but 5,000,000 rounds are expected from France.Artillery. Mountain 65-rnm. 120 guns, 1,700 rounds each. 75-mm. 48 guns, 1,350 rounds each.Field. 75-mm. 104 guns, 2,200 rounds each. Heavy, 120-mm. 36 guns, &apos;750 rounds each. 6-inch 12 howitzers, 360 rounds each. Skoda, 105-mm. 6 guns, 1,400 rounds each.Arms are well kept. Many guns are very old, but are serviceable for some time to come. (Ona group undecipherable) French Mission report that carriages are steady, but there is a shortage of spare parts.   Bores have no signs of coppering.(? Transport). Probably the greatest difficulty has been Ushak railway. With .some additional engines from Greece sufficient trains are now running to feed the troops and to form advance dep6ts.   For service beyond advance depots there are at
Ushak, lorries, heavy, 300 ; light, 75 ; camels, 1,000 ; country carts, 2,500. At Brussa, lorries, heavy, 150 ; light, 45; camels, 1,000; carts, 2,500. Divisions are complete with pack transport. Animals are generally in good condition excpt pack ponies which contrast badly with pack mules.   There is a reserve of 3,000 animals.Aviation. Not good and weather in forward areas had been impossible for the last month. Air photographs are indifferent and taken from about 10,000 feet, and staff&apos; is not very good at reading them. Staff officers complain bitterly of the last consignment of aeroplanes from France and think naval air service better equipped and trained.Communication. Good use made of existing means, but Greeks need more wireless sets. (? It appears that) English short range sets work well, but French sets are said to be unsatisfactorary. Establishment of army headquarters at Ushak will facilitate communication with main operations, but will render co-ordination of the 3rd Army Corps&apos; movement difficult. Existing long-range wireless is indifferent and good installation is badly needed.Finally. Work shown on the few recent air photographs available does not suggest tliat Kemal.means to accept decisive action at Kutahaia. I have just seen M. Sterghiados whose information foretells Kemafs retreat after delaying actions. He contested my opinion that the Greek Army would resent being kept on another winter in the field, pointing out that this idea has constantly recurred in the past and proved false. He declares that if Greece receives financial and political support the army will cheerfully keep the field for two more years if necessary.Reverse last March and April and subsequent isolation was probably the best thing that could have happened for the Greek Army. It has shaken them out of false security. They have set themselves to develop their own resources and effort has made them more efficient and capable of utilizing help if they deserve it.APPENDIX B 1.From General Harington, Constantinople, to War Office. -Telegram No. 451, cipher, 18th June, 1912.Your No. 89260, MI. 2. I have seen Parts 1 and 2 of Colonel Nairnes report-I can only express my opinion that he is very optimistic. The picture painted by Colonel Nairne, after a very short visit, is at variance with my personal impression of the Greek troops who were under me and with reports received by me continuously for months past from four of my officers wTho have lived with and been present at actual fighting of the Greek troops. If I have given )rou and Cabinet wrong military opinion I shall be the first to admit it but I do not think I have. I said quite clearly that I was impressed by what I saw of the Greek troops, and if they had been properly taken in hand 6 months ago and their preparations made thorough, I have no doubt strength could have been obtained, but they wore committed when ill-prepared as they say themselves for political reasons and the high command failed, the troops and the Greek Army has steadily declined as an effective fighting machine, both in my opinion and that of the French.There is a wave of optimism at the present moment and, I believe, Greek soldiers recover their morale quickly. I think the men themselves are good and are obedient, but after the last two attempts they have little faith in their leaders. I gave you picture and figures of both sides in my telegram No. 415, 10th June, and only the actual fighting can determine result. There is almost an indecent rush to gain our sympathy and support at every turn. I am sending General Mardon off to-morrow to form independent military opinion. He will spend 2 days on the Brusa front and 3 days on the Ushak front. I have every confidence, though time is short, in the opinion he will form though it is very difficult to judge real value of commanders, and unless they are seen actually handling the troops in action. Many of the commanders are untried men and this applies to the staff&apos;.I have seen Major Strover, my liaison officer, from Brusa, to-day. He tells me soldiers ,are keen and have recovered better than he expected, but many commanders and staffs are weak, and, in his opinion, operations may go through if things go well to start with, but if a serious check is encountered, he does not trust ability of the
higher command, and if another failure results he thinks it would be very serious to army. He tells me definitely that the Brusa Corps in not so good a fighting machine as it was last year.In order that I may see Colonel Nairne on arrival here on Monday I have postponed my visit to Chanak, and I will wire again my impressions. I notice he makes no comments on value of artillery. 1 shall spare no efforts to get you correct picture, as I consider information you require is so vital.On relief by other Greek troops, 11th Division leaves Ismid to-morrow for Brusa, and my information points to offensive operations beginning 4 days after its arrival at Brusa.   I have seen what I believe to be nature of operations contemplated.APPENDIX B 2.From General Headquarters, Constantinople, to War Office. Telegram No. 472, cipher, 23rd June, 1921. Continuation my No. 451, 18th June.1. The fighting strength available for front line appears to be the only total which matters. My estimate of this is given in my No. 415, dated 18th May. Nairrie&apos;s estimate of 160 rifles per company approximates to my estimate of 1,500 rifles per regiment, and upon this important point we seem to agree.A detailed estimate, No. 45445 I., of 16th June, of the Greek Army, which I had prepared before receipt of Colonel Nairne&apos;s report was sent you by bag yesterday. This explains estimate given in my telegram No. 415, if allowance is made for arrival of 12th Division, destination of which was not declared when No. 454451. was prepared.It seems total of 60,000 rifles, which in my No. 415 I was prepared to accept for an approximate maximum, must be too high in any case, and that Colonel Nairne&apos;s figures agree that the actual number of rifles available for offensive operations will be more like 45,000 than the 55,000 indicated in my telegram No. 415, if the 6,500 rifles mentioned therein are to be retained as protective troops.Number of front line rifles will not be affected by the 3,000 rifles mentioned in my telegram No. 445, dated 18th June.2. As regards ration strength I think (?) figures may be between 190,000 and 200,000.3. Estimate as regards artillery approximately agrees with Nairne&apos;s, but my doubt regarding completeness of divisional artillery appears to have been justified as 4th Divisional has only one group. Colonel Nairne&apos;s figures as regards artillery ammunition are (?) those provided by Greece.I would (?) draw attention to my No. 471, dated 23rd June, in this connection, with which Colonel Nairne is in agreement. This does nOt point out liberal scale of ammunition for offensive operations. It will also be remembered that Greek transport arrangements failed to feed front line effectively in the last offensive, and Turks have had ample time to obstruct communication (?) arrangements Greeks will require for advance. General Gramat at Athens also reports unfavourably on Greek ammunition stocks, though his report is distrusted by Colonel Nairne.4. In consequence of plan envisaged, separate columns and converging operations will call for close co-operation if they are to be effective. Inter-communication between columns is weak point with regard to Greeks, and that arrangements are still deficient in this respect is indicated by Colonel Nairne&apos;s report.5. As regards command. Nature of Greek plan will call for determined leading and acceptance of responsibility by column commanders. There are many weak links in the chain, and whether the Greek commanders as a whole can rise to the occasion the fighting alone can show, but, from what I know of some of them, I am not confident. To my mind Turkish commanders must have advantage in continuity of purpose. Their object is clear, but in the minds of many Greek commanders there must be uncertainty.
Extract from General Harington&apos;s Telegram No. 461, dated 21st June.To-day I have had a long interview with Colonel Nairne.   Generally his figures of Greeks agree with mine.   The Greek troops were considerably better than he had expected, but he was shown the best corps and the best divisions.   I have no wish to discount his report, which has been made in all good faith.   The fighting alone can tell. He tells me that the recent rain has made the ground in Ushak area in dreadful state.   It looks now as if operations will take place between 3rd July and 10 th July;, not before.   I cannot see how either side can have a decisive success.   Even if the Greeks gain preliminary objective(s), which they may, it will not lead them anywhere. The Turks may accept battle or withdraw and entice (?) Greeks into the blue.  1 cannot foresee any (?) military Gallipoli for decision which will help the future.   I am off to-Chanak and Gallipoli for a couple of days, as the local situation is certainly much, better.APPENDIX C 1.From General Mardon, Smyrna, to War Office. Telegram No. T.M. 2, cipher, 2lst June, 1921.1. Have interviewed Colonel Pallis, Chief of Staff, Colonel Suryannis, Sub-Chief of Staff, and have also discussed details with bureaux of intelligence, personnel, artillery,, aviation and engineering.   It appears that plan of operations, which aims at destruction, of Turkish forces, is best that can be devised in the circumstances.   Present Greek distribution, exclusive of troops for lines of communication and troops for guarding southern front, is 4 divisions Brusa front and 7 divisions and 1 cavalry brigade Ushak front available for operations.   According to Greek information, Turkish distribution is 1 division Adabazar, 6 Eskishehr front, 7 Kutaya front, 2 Karahissar front, with 1 cavalry division Eskishehr, 1 south of Kutaya, 1 west of Karahissar.   Greek divisions are considerably stronger than Turkish divisions.   Greeks claim total superiority of 3 to 2 in infantry, rather more than 2 to&quot;l in artillery, 4 to 1 in aeroplanes, and 3 to 1 in machine guns, while Greeks have automatic rifles and Turks have (?) none.2. Superiority in infantry will, at the decisive point in operations, rise at the outset to 2 to 1, with other arms in proportion, but Turks will be on interior lines. Greek plan aims at avoiding fighting Turks in prepared positions. Their operations, therefore, depend on mobility and accurate information &apos;of Turkish dispositions. Owing to inexperience and want of organization of the Intelligence branch, which is under a young and inexperienced officer, and owing to continuous bad flying weather on the front, I am not satisfied that the Greek High Command has sufficient knowledge of Turkish dispositions or of possibility of their utilizing their interior position(s). Plan involves certain detached operations, with accompanying necessity for good communica-tion and initiative on the part of some divisional commanders. Communications are a point, but the Greeks have done their best to remedy this defect, and for detached work have selected their experienced commanders. Only three of the Divisional Generals,, and none of the Corps Commanders, have had experience in the Great War. General Headquarters seemed very confident, and, as far as can be judged at present, adminis-trative arrangements appear to meet requirements. Operations may be great success if all goes well, and if they fail, military position of Greeks will not be worse than at present, since the Turks are reputed immobile. Am proceeding to-morrow to Ushak front.
From Smyrna to War Office.Telegram No. T.l . 3, cipher, dated 26th June, 1921.1. During the course of my visit to Ushak front I have seen the following : Commanders and staffs of 1st and 2nd Corps, 1st, 2nd, 5th, 13th Divisions and Cavalry Brigade. Units of all arms and services in camps of 1st, 5th and 13th Divisions. Cavalry Brigade and 5th Infantry Regiment carrying out separate tactical schemes. Commanders of 4th and 9th Divisions. 25th Regiment of the 9th Division, 7th and 34th Regiments of the 2nd Division, together with mountain and heavy artillery in position on outpost lines. Field artillery at driving drill and on the march. Automatic rifles, rifle grenades section and several types of machine guns fired. Ammunition column and wireless section. Both naval and military air squadrons and aerodromes, supply and transport dep6ts at Ushak and Banaz. Tactical schemes were carried out at short notice; programme was not previously arranged; and I am satisfied I saw average units.Commanders and staffs. 1st Corps. Capabilities of General Kondoulis are difficult to gauge, as he does not speak English or French, but has very good staff who .have been together for 3 years. He appears to have common sense and to trust them. During last operations he showed judgment, withdrawal of his corps being well carried out.2. 2nd Corps. During last operations towards Eskishehir, General Vlachopoulos was in command of the 3rd Corps. He is a well educated officer, with good military knowledge, but apt to be excitable. His corps headquarters have only just been reformed.   Staff, which wants time to get together, appears average.Commanders of 2nd, 5th, 9th, 13th Divisions, and Cavalry Brigade, all seem to be very capable soldiers and well up to their work.Commanders of 1st and 4th are old, and have no recent war experience.Staffs.  1st Division entirely new; Chief of Staff fairly average, but without experience. All three regimental commanders have lately taken over. They look old and soft, and have no recent war experience.2nd Division. Staff has remained on, and is good. Regimental commanders quite satisfactory. 5th Division good. Commander of 43rd Regiment appeared quite satisfactory. Shortly, divisions all new and without recent war experience. Commander of 25th Regiment appeared satisfactory. 13th Division good. An excellent impression was created by commander 5th Evzone Cavalry Regiment. Cavalry Brigade : brigade major and regimental commanders appeared well up to their work.3. The manoeuvres which we saw carried out by cavalry, infantry and artillery were all very well done. Unit commanders and commanders of squadrons, batteries and companies up to their work, and had their men well in hand. Non-commissioned officers very good, and their sections were commanded by them in a very satisfactory manner. Formations adopted were suitable to the ground and scheme. In the contemplated operations cavalry brigade should be a very useful weapon. Horse batteries, machine-gun groups and cavalry were well handled, and all worked well together. Turks have only mounted infantry. All camps that I inspected were admirably laid out and camouflaged with trees and branches, very clean, with horse lines very well looked after and animals in very good condition without exception. Discipline evidently excellent; men were cheerful and saluted extraordinarily well. They looked very hard, practically no sickness, and by training and games kept them-selves &quot;in good health. In spite of adverse weather conditions morale very high. Men are perpetually asking when the King, whose picture is very prominent everywhere, is coming to start the operations.4. General impression existing outside that Greeks were defeated is not held by officers and men themselves who in this section feel that they have always beaten the Turks whenever met in spite of inferiority of numbers; this force has also had a great accession in strength, both in new formations and effectives. Among battalion commanders and junior regimental officers few changes have taken place, while 80 per cent, of the rank and file are trained old soldiers who have seen fighting ; I consider units themselves form an efficient fighting force, their marching powers are of a high order, their equipment is serviceable but they have neither the same idea as to its
maintenance nor the means thereof that we have. Great deal of the pack saddlery is new and generally in good order. Machine guns are very well kept and the Schwartzlose is an excellent weapon.Artillery. Batteries on the front are well sited and camouflaged. Heavy artillery have excellent platforms and emplacements. Appear well trained and commanded. Majority of corps, division and group commanders are unchanged and with good war experience. Against prepared positions, however, Go millimetre mountain gun is a poor weapon. 120 millimetre long guns that were inspected were in good condition and good shooting results have lately been given by this gun. There are not enough tractors so a proportion are being bullock drawn.5. Reference my remarks in my No. T.M. 2, 21st June, reference intelligence work. It is obvious that the 1st Corps who are holding this front have been entrusted with the task of obtaining information with regard to Turkish positions. This is being very capably carried out by Major Phillipov who was trained by us in Salonika and has been doing this work ever since. His information, which is probably correct, shows three divisions at Afiun Karahissar and live on Eskishehir front instead of as stated in my No. T.M. 2, Turks have evidently organized position(s) round Kutahia against attack, but there is little wire and there will still be possibility of outflanking. Around Afiun Karahissar they are showing renewed activity. It appears from aeroplane photographs they have not increased capacity of railheads at Kutahia and Chekurlar station.To the lack of really good machines, difficulties of repairs, lack of spare engines and distance from heavy workshops, which are at Smyrna and Salonika, can be attributed the restricted use of aeroplanes for reconnaissance by Greeks. Commanders of naval and military air service state their airmen know the country intimately.6. Colonel Nairne&apos;s figures appear to be correct regarding ammunition reserve supply and transport. I have gone into this ammunition expenditure by mountain and field artillery with 2nd Division during last operations, and to judge from this there should be an ample supply of ammunition for the main operations, and, if matters came to a deadlock, sufficient to last 2 or 3 months. Except as regards 6-inch howitzers, which are rather short, same remarks apply to heavy artillery. Ammunition supply appears very well organized. Ample supply centre now at Ushak, which Colonel Mangedlaris commands; his duties are really a combination of advanced base and lines of communication from advanced base to fighting troops; he is very capable and has been continuously engaged on this work since (?) 1912, has good organization and appears well served. The following are the transport arrangements for contemplated operations: (a.) Motor transport, 166 light F.I.A.T. lorries and 400 (3-ton) lorries. (6.) Two camel groups of about 600 each.(c.) Wheeled transport,  1  group of 1,000  (two-wheeled) carts and, to be requisitioned, 1 group of trailer (?) bullock carts.7. This appears adequate but only 60 per cent, of heavy lorries and 35 per cent, of light lorries have arrived at Ushak so far, whilst of two-wheeled carts there is a 30 per cent, shortage. It is understood that all these are available now at Smyrna. In general, lorries are not being used for the supply of troops but are parked awaiting operations. From first day of operations delivering capacity of railway at Otourak will be 600 tons per day. Excellent bread is being turned out by the field bakeries at Ushak and, generally speaking, rations are very good. I estimate that administrative arrangements cannot be completed under another fortnight. Medical arrangements appear fairly satisfactory, hospitals being improvised as required, but are not on anything like same scale as ours. Inspected pack ambulance which was well equipped with medical stores and operating instruments. Greeks have two hospital ships and a hospital train.8. Divisions have a strength of 11,000 12,000 rations, with a fighting strength of 7,300 and a rifle strength of about 4,500. Last figure excludes automatic rifle and machine-gun men. My general impression is that Turks expect attacks both at Kutaya and Afiun Karahissar and will make their stand at the former place and Eskishehir. Greek attacks cannot be a surprise and round Kutaya position I forecast heavy fighting. As far as formations I have seen are concerned, I consider southern group of the Greek Army to be quite efficient fighting machine, but higher command of 1st Division is very indifferent and staffs of 2nd Corps and 9th Division are yet to be proved efficient. I have not seen 12th Division and 4th Division, but the 4th is likely to play a minor role.
9. Hank and file cannot understand why they do not move forward and are eager to commence operations. They are confident they can beat the Turks and are anxious to finish the war and return to their homes, as they have been in the field so long. All the above (one group undecipherable) the southern groups where lighting has been tactically successful and where very large reinforcement have arrived. To-morrow I leave Smyrna for Brusa, and expect to return to Constantinople on 30th June when I shall send (one group omitted) (?) report. Every courtesy has been shown us by commanders of 1st and 2nd Corps. We have been given all facilities for seeing what we wanted at shortest notice. Our visit was marked by cheering for England, the National Anthem and displays of Union Jacks.APPENDIX C. 3.From Major-General Marden, Constantinople, to War Office.Telegram No. T.M.    cipher, &apos;60ih June, 1921.I have seen at Brusa commanders and staffs of 3rd Corps, 3rd and 7th Divisions arid the majority of the regiments of (?) 1st Division. I was unable to visit 10th Division as it is undertaking operations towards Ismid. which 11th Division quitted yesterday. I have also seen supply dumps and aerodrome(s). I paid a visit to the front line which is naturally very strong and is well wired with trenches excellently (? group omitted). I saw a battalion in marching order also half squadron of divisional cavalry and field and mountain gunners doing gun drill on guns in position. Commanders and staff. General Polimenckos, commanding corps, is an unknown quantity but has a (? group omitted) Chief of the Staff and 3rd Bureau. General Tricoupis, commanding 3rd Division, and a first rate officer well known to us and he has a good and experienced staff. 7th Division commander, Colonel Palis is either eccentric or nervous, but he has a very good Chief of the Staff and an average staff otherwise. Regimental commanders in the corps appear average with exception of two, who are excellent,100 officers from 7th Division, who were in original national defence force division, have been transferred to other division in the corps. Morale and discipline of troops appear much same as on Smyrna front. The information regarding enemy is not very definite as there is such a long distance between Greek and Tuikish outposts but he undoubtedly has his main force round Kutaiya. Polimenckos commands 7th and 10th Divisions, and Tricoupis 3rd and 11th Divisions during operations, both with separate missions. There are only five aeroplanes with only four pilots and four observers, no wireless apparatus. Situation reviewed as a whole is that Greek Army is soundly organized on. French lines, that proper preparations have been made for the task in view, that the troops are fairly well-trained, are practically equipped, and have very good morale and discipline. High command is weak and in many cases staff work wants co-ordinating. Capable staff officers are likely to be overworked, Means of communication between detached forces are not sufficient. Use of Intelligence branch is not fully appreciated and arrangements for distributing information are poor. ,Men are handicapped in prolonged fighting by the fact that they do not carry entrenching tools, and by the absence of any water arrangements beyond water bottles. They have no means of getting through wire except wire cutters. Turkish Army is, however, believed to be not well-organized or equipped, and to have insufficient troops while desertions are frequent. Odds are, therefore, in favour of Greeks, who at the worst have strong position to which they can withdraw. If it is decided to help the Greeks the order of importance is moral, financial and material assistance. Staff officers, wireless sets, aeroplanes and workshops, ammunition tanks, are the chief necessities for the army, but all will be useless unless commands and staffs are reorganized, and officers with war experience are utilized in their proper spheres. Officers who were already fairly senior in the Balkan, wars and who lack all the experience gained by other officers during European war have been brought back to important commands after 5 years&apos; absence from military duties. Artillery Commanders are the exception.   The units themselves will probably save the situation.
From General Harington to War Office.Telegram No. 5Q9, cipher, 28th June, 1921.General Mardens report on the Greek Army on Ushak front has been seen by me,, and I have every confidence in what he says. (?) He is an officer of great (8 groups omitted). Since the last offensive it is evident that great strides have been made, but I still am sceptic of the untried commanders and staff. I do not think General Marden or Colonel IN airne will find the same high standard on the Brusa front. The first opinion I formed of the 11th Division has been justified by recent events. They simply threw away Ismid for no reason whatever. General Marden puts date of offensive as 6th or 8th July.   The real value can be determined only by fighting.APPENDIX E.SUPPLIES FOR GREEKS.A.
