This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.664SECRET.CP. 3199.4 &quot;ITHE CABINET,THE MILITARY SITUATION IN UPPER SILESIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR. I circulate herewith a memorandum by the General Staff on the situation in Upper    0154Silesia.The War Office,5th August, 1921.L. W.-E.1. System of Command.The Allied forces in Upper Silesia consist of French, British and Italian contingents, under the supreme command of General Gratier. a French officer, who is junior in rank to Major-General Sir W. G. Heneker, the British Commander, and inferior in tact and ability. The position is further complicated by the fact that although, theoretically, General Gratier should take his orders from the High Commission, he is actually directly subordinate to General Le Rond, the French President of the Commission, who is senior to him in the Army and gives him orders direct.2. Zones of Command.The plebiscite area is at present divided into three zones, i.e., a British, a French and an Italian zone, vide map A (only six copies of this map have been reproduced).The British zone is the territory lying north of a line funning roughly south-east from Oppeln to Beuthen, and then due east to the Polish frontier. The French zone is bounded on the north by the southern boundary of the British zone, on the east and. south by the Polish frontier, and on the west by the line of the Oder. The Italian zone is all territory west of the Oder up to the Oppeln-Breslau railway.3. Strength and distribution of the Allied forces.(a.) The Allied forces.The following Allied troops are at present in Upper Silesia :  (i.) French, under the com-   9 battalions of infantry    ... ]mand of Brantes.General de(ii.)

The distribution of the Allied troops and location of units are shown in Appendix I. and Map A.The British locations are accurate; those of the French and Italians may not be absolutely up-to-date, but are generally correct.(b.) Local Upper Silesian Forces under the Control of the High Commission.(i.) The Apo or Plebiscite Police Force. After the Polish rising in September, 1920, the former German Upper Silesian Police Force (the Sicherheitspolizei) were transformed into a mixed force of Plebiscite Police (Apo), recruited in equal numbers from Poles and Germans.During Korfanty&apos;s insurrection in the early part of May, the Polish members of the police deserted and joined the rebels. Subsequently the Commission enlisted some 3,000 Germans to fill up the ranks, and these fought against the Poles in May and J une.A number of these men proved ill-disciplined, and 1,300 of these have now been discharged. The present strength of the Plebiscite Police is about 4,500, practically all Germans.(ii.) The Gemeinde Wachen (Voluntary Communal Guards). After the evacuation by the Poles of the Eastern districts, subsequent to the May rebellion, the Commission decided to organize Gemeinde Wachen (i.e., Voluntary Communal Guards) as a further protection against disturbances. Little reliance,can, however, be placed on this force in most districts as, at all events in the Southern (French) area, Germans have been excluded, and the Gemeinde Wachen are mainly composed of Poles who have, taken part in the last insurrection.The existence of these armed Polish organizations, which are thus officially recognized by the Commission, presents a considerable danger, as the Gemeinde Wachen in the French area would form a nucleus immediately available for a new Polish insurgent force. Owing to their duties, the Gemeinde Wachen are bound to be in close liaison with the French Authorities ; owing to their police duties they are in a favourable position to provoke isolated outbreaks by the German population, by means of illegal oppression.4. Present Military Situation.At present, in spite of alarmist rumours, all is quiet in Upper Silesia. There is little danger of a German rising, though organizations exist to combat a Polish outbreak.On the other hand, the Poles have undoubtedly made all preparations for a fresh Putsch, and General Heneker wired on 30th July that he was in possession of the Polish plans for this new rebellion. Before leaving Upper Silesia, General Le Bond appears to have requested the Poles to keep quiet, but the exact measure of his authority over them is not known, nor how long this peaceful state is intended to last. Korfanty himself is now in Paris and has been there since 18th July.Considerable friction has been caused by the action of Allied flying columns, owing to the activities of the French leaders of these columns. As a result of certain incidents (Krappitz and Cosel), British and Italian troops were withdrawn from the columns, and the Commission gave instructions that no more columns were to be sent out.A few minor incidents have also occurred, mainly due to the provocative attitude of the local French authorities.There has been no trouble of any description in the British zone for the last 3 weeks.Poles have been leaving the German area, and some 6,000 Germans have left the Polish districts of Pless and Rybnik. Many Germans are also leaving the industrial area.It is important that all frontier roads and railways should be closed. This has been done efiectivelv in the British area, both towards Germany and Poland, but there is much evidence to show that, in the French zone, the Polish frontier remains open, and that there is no check on men or material coming into the French area from Poland. In fact, a perambulation of the High Commission en cirque along the frontier on 17th July, disclosed the fact that the posts in the French area had only been placed on that day. The Director of Military Intelligence, then on tour, met the lorries with the frontier posts going to their positions.All roads and railways in the French area are held by Korf&apos;anty&apos;s police, who are usually west of the frontier. .
5. Probability of a fresh rising.(a.) As lias already been stated there is little danger of a German rising. It is true that the surrender of arms by the Selbstsohutz organizations in Upper Silesia has been unsatisfactory, and no doubt fairly large numbers of machine guns and rifles would be available in case of need. It is not, however, believed that the Germans will be the aggressors, or that they will initiate any attempt to dispute the decisions of the Supreme Council by armed force. On the other hand, they are undoubtedly preparing to oppose any fresh Polish rising, and there is always the danger that, if exposed to too much provocation by the French or Poles, they will be driven to isolated acts of reprisals, which might develop into a general conflict. It is reported that Major-General v. Lequis, who commanded a Eeichswehr Brigade in the Polish rising of Augus&quot;t, 1919, has been selected to replace General Hoefer in case of a new outbreak. He is said to be of the old Junker type a brute and a bully.There is no risk of a German rising being supported by the German Government, or reinforced by regular German troops, except by a few deserters. The German Government is doing its utmost to calm the German population, and to prevent any interference with the Allied troops or resistance to the decisions of the Supreme Council.The German Government have despatched Dr. Dominicus, the Prussian Minister of the Interior, and Dr. Peters, Commissioner for Disarmament, to Upper Silesia, to bring pressure to bear on the local German Upper Silesian leaders to adopt a peaceful attitude.(6.) There have been frequent reports of an impending Polish rebellion, and. there is no doubt that all the plans for a fresh rising are ready. General Heneker reported on 30th July that he had obtained possession of the organization and plan to be adopted for the next Polish insurrection, which are on the same lines as those of last May&apos;s Putsch.On 27th July several hundreds of armed Poles were seen near Myslowitz, in the French area.It may be taken as certain that no fresh Polish rising will take place if seriously opposed by the French authorities, and if the Poles know that the French troops will co-operate actively and loyally with the Allies in dealing with the insurgents.6. Plan for dealing with a German or Polish rising.It is essential that a plan of action against rebels or invaders, whether Germans or Poles, should be adopted forthwith, and before any decision of the Supreme Council is made known. General Heneker has drawn up a plan, and it has been approved by General Gratier in writing.This plan would ensure joint Allied military action in case of either a Polish or German rising.   The plan consists generally of concentration in the Industrial area.British area      ...   Tarnowitz and Beuthen.Italian area       ...   Peiskretscham and Tost.French area       ...   North of the line Gleiwitz-Myslowitz.General Heneker can concentrate in this area in 6 hours. Three Allied infantry battalions, two French cavalry squadrons and a group of French field artillery are to garrison Oppeln and remain there to hold the town.According to the plan, combined Allied offensive action will be taken either against Germans or Poles, as the case may be. Important railway stations on the Polish frontier are to be held by Allied forces.On 27th July, General Heneker wired that the Commission had not by then accepted the plan, owing to opposition from General Le Bond. On the 28th, the plan was discussed in Commission, and the Italians then refused to concentrate further east than Eatibor or Cosel. General Le Rond continued his opposition to the plan, and it is not quite clear if it was adopted finally by the Commission. General Heneker warned Genera] Le Rond that, in case of any outbreak, the British troops would take measures immediately to suppress it by force. The Commission should be instructed to adopt the plan without delay, if they have not already done so.It is important to put an end to the present arrangement, by which General Le Rond exercises supreme authority over the French troops. He is the President of the Allied Commission, but should have no authority other than that of mouthpiece of the Commission, i.e., to convey the majority decisions of the Commission to General Gratier, the Commander of the Allied Forces.
There is believed to be no danger of a German rising at the present time. If there is loyal co-operation between the Allied forces, they are quite strong enough to deal with any local Polish rising, unless supported by a large number of Polish troops from across the frontier. These would not move unless they knew their action would be countenanced by France. If both Poles and Germans know that the Allies will act together in perfect unison, there is no danger of serious trouble, even in the event of a decision greatly adverse to either side., There is therefore no need for further Allied reinforcements, from the purely military point of view, if we can be certain of loyal co-operation among the Allies.If no such certainty exists, reinforcements of French troops only, cannot fail to complicate the present situation, and render it more difficult and dangerous. In the May rising the Poles were encouraged by the attitude adopted by the French, who did nothing to oppose them. All Germans and, indeed, practically all the British officers in Upper Silesia, believe that General Le Rqnd was throughout the May insurrection in close touch with Korfanty, and he has supported the Poles during the entire period of his stay in Upper Silesia. In these circumstances, it is considered a military danger to send fresh reinforcements of French troops, unless British and Italian troops can be sent simultaneously. British troops could ill be spared. It is essential not to alter the present military equilibrium in Upper Silesia by strengthening the French, as this would increase the chances of a fresh Polish Putsch, and it is doubtful whether the French would in this case offer any resistance to the Poles, in view of the close relations existing between them.Note. Appendix II. is a letter from General Sackville-West as to theFrench statements that 40-60,000 Allied troops are required for Upper Silesia.8. Summary.To sum up, the situation is as follows : (a.) No German rising need be apprehended, if provocation is avoided.(6.) A fresh Polish rebellion will only take place if encouraged by the French.(c.) No further reinforcements are required if the Allies co-operate loyally.(d.) The military situation can only be improved and simplified by handing over immediately to Poland or Germany any territories regarding which there can be no doubt as to their ultimate ownership, i.e., Pless and most of Rybnikto Poland, and the western and north-western districts to Germany.

I know also that Monsieur BertheTot made a statement to the effect that the Versailles Committee had also maintained that some 40,000 were necessary. As you may wish to know the real facts of the case, I send you the following information ; An &quot; ad hoc&quot; committee was appointed in October, 1919, to consider the strength and composition of the Allied contingents necessary for the Plebiscite Areas. The British members were Sir Eyre Crowe and General Sackviile-West, Monsieur Laroche and General Weygand for France, Genera] Bliss forimerica,. and, I think, a Japanese representative. So far as Upper Silesia was concerned, the Committee recommended that a force of 18 battalions with etceteras would be necessary, each battalion to be six to eight hundred strong. Since that date the question has never been discussed by the Military Committee of Versailles. I spoke to General Weygand yesterday on the subject, and he agreed with what 1 have said above.It is true that Marshal Foch has, at various times, spoken to the Conference of Ambassadors, and possibly to the Supreme Council about Upper Silesia, and may have expressed an opinion with regard to, the strength of the Allied troops there, but, if he did. it has never been as a result of any discussion on the subject by the Allied Military Committee.I informed the Embassy here of the above as soon as I saw Monsieur Berthelofs statement quoted, above.(Sgd.)     C. SACKVILLE-WEST, Major-General,British Representative, Allied Military Committee of Versailles..
