[This Document is tile rToperty ot His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Gojrernment.]Printed for the Cabinet   July 1921.SECRET.CP. 3173.THE CABINET.THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES IN EGYPT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.THE following letter has been forwarded to me by Lord Colwyn, and I think this aspect should be seriously considered by the Cabinet.w. s. c.Colonial Office, July 28, 1021.To the Right Hon. Lord Colwyn.You have &quot;been good enough to state that my views concerning the present situation in Egypt-as it affects the lives, property and interests of the various European communities resident there also concerning some possible results of the proposed British evacuation of Egypt, may be useful to you. I shall accordingly try to confine myself to such matters, and to give reasons for the anxiety felt by many people who have been connected with Egypt for a considerable time past, and who have their families and interests there, at the prospect of that country being handed over to the Egyptians, without any British authorities to whom they could appeal, when necessary, for justice and protection.The present delegation may represent the views of part of the Egyptian people, but the great majority of the Egyptians live &quot;on the land&quot; and are much more interested in the progress of their crops, and the price their cotton will fetch, than in anything connected with politics, although they would no doubt occasionally shout for &quot; Independence,&quot; now that it has become a catch word.Since December 1918 there has been no shortage of plausible &quot; orators &quot; in Egypt  self-seeking and imbued with a hatred of every European and non-Mohammedan  who have done their best to develop in the native a hatred of everything British or European. Their efforts led to many excesses in 1919 and 1920, and to the more serious riots which occasioned considerable loss of life and damage to -property in Alexandria and Cairo during May this year.It seems to me that the fanatical behaviour of the Egyptians in the recent riots in Alexandria has hardly been realised yet in this country, and that we have not yet learnt the lesson of what Egyptian hatred may at any time mean to the Europeans resident among them. That Europeans of any nationality should be attacked at sight in the main streets of the town and butchered under revolting conditions, while the Egyptian police watched unconcernedly and even helped the mobs ; that Egyptian troops on being drafted into the town to restore order should look upon it as their chief duty to fire upon the Europeans and to incite the mobs to further looting and murder;, that these riots would have become even more widespread, to the grave danger of every European in Egypt, had not the British troops eventually stepped in and restored order these are not pleasant topics for one&apos;s mind to dwell upon, and residents in Egypt will have cause for anxiety if the Egyptian police force and troops are to provide the &quot; protection &quot; in future !Many such people are leaving Egypt, or, when possible, disposing of theirlanels and interests there ; and this week I have had a letter from an importer of British goods in [6677]
Alexandria stating that lie is anxious to transfer part of his -capital to some other country, so as to be able to leave Egypt, should that become necessary.Everything to-day is uncertain in Egypt, as the people who are interested financially in the country are waiting to know the results of the discussions that are now going on concerning its future. But if it were certain that Great Britain had decided not to evacuate Egypt, 1 think there would be little doubt about a continuation of that country&apos;s prosperity. Egypt has made wonderful progress during the past twenty years or more, yet there can surely be few countries where the natives have had so little to do with the results obtained.Practically all imports and exports are dealt with by foreign firms, who originally founded these businesses. The finest buildings in Cairo and Alexandria are the work of European architects, and are owned by Europeans. The big banks, hotels, &amp;c, are in no way due to native enterprise.The attempts made to found purely Egyptian banks or commercial concerns have generally been doomed to failure. The Egyptians, or a good many of the Egyptians, would like to have control of a country they have clone little to develop ; but the Europeans, who have achieved everything under British law and justice, would run the risk of seeing their life&apos;s work ruined.The chief cotton-exporting firms of Egypt are British. Many of the most important banks and land companies are British. They are viewing the prospective change of Government with real concern. If it is not too late, I should like to express the hope that some of the prominent English residents in Egypt men who have spent a lifetime in the country-should be consulted before any decisions are finally arrived at with the Egyptian Delegation in London. Great Britain has done fine work in Egypt, and continental countries recognise the fact, however much they may at times try to belittle this work.The British and foreign communities out there have created vast business houses, and have done their share in making Cairo and Alexandria two of the most prosperous towns in Africa. Surely the people who have achieved so much are entitled to some protection from the corruption of the native Law Courts and from outbursts of hatred on the part of the Mohammedan mobs and military forces!Great Britain has done much for Egypt, and she can do a great deal more by not allowing her good work to be ruined ; whilst there may be commercial and political advantages to be derived which will make it worth any country&apos;s while to be strongly represented there. But if Great Britain should decide to withdraw from Egypt, many of us will fear that the days of Egypt&apos;s material well-being are at an end, and that there will in the future be anxious times for many living in that country.
