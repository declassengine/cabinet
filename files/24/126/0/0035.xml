,   THIS DOCUMENT IS TEE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS GOVERNMF!!&amp;7 cabinet.R^TORT BY THE gggRAL OFFICER C0MMANDING-INrCHI5FON TO? SITUATION IN IRELAND FOR OTK ENDING9th   JULY, 1921. (Circulated by the Secretary of State for War).1, G&quot;&apos;^RAL SITUATION.Murders of individuals, the burning of houses and attempts to wreck trains carrying troops were the principal activities of the rebels during the early part of the past week.Between Killaloe and Ennis, Co.Clare, an attempt to blow up a train conveying an Auxiliary   Coy. R.I.C. was frustrated by a Military patrol, which dispersed the rebels,   A passenger train conveying a party of troops was bombed between Clondalkin and Inchicore, Co. Dublinj there were no casualties to troops but several civilians were wounded or injured..2.      The event of outstanding interest during the week developed after the second Conference between Mr.De Valera and the four Unionist representatives of Southern Ireland.   About 1,30 p.m. on Friday 8th, July, Lord Midleton and his three colleagues called at my Headquarters,    After these gentlemen had left, I held a ,   Conference with the Chief of Police, General Boyd, CommandingDublin District and Mr. Cope Assistant Under Secretary; as a result . of this Conference I wrote to Lord Midleton, Informing him of the extent to which I was prepared to ease down Military and Police activities, and of the guarantees which I considered Mr.De Valera should be required to give.3.      Subsequently in order to explain certain points raised on this letter by the Conference I went to the Mansion House. After a conversation I agreed to suspend certain activities of the Crown Forces and to withdraw certain restrictions and I required Mr.de.Valera to give certain undertakings on his part.    These are embodied in a revised letter written by me to-Lord Midleton. Mr,. De Valera having agreed in principle to my demands, a communique was Issued from G.H.Q. on the next morning to the Press, setting forth the conditions which had been agreed upon with a view to creating an atmosphere in which peaceable proposals might be discussed in London,    A copy of the communique is given in Appendix V (a) of this report,4.      On the following morning, July 9th. two of Mr.de Valerafs supporters,. Messrs E.T.Duggan and R.C.Barton, were brought to my Office by Mr. Cope.    These two gentlemen expressed themselves as surprised and aggrieved that the G.H.Q. communique to the Press should have referred to the instructions which Ivlr.de Valera was issuing to his supporters.     I explained that the terms of these Instructions had been discussed with Mp. de Valera and agreed to in principle by him, and that it was on this understanding that I had agreed to curtail the activities of the troops under my Command.    The point in the official communique were then discussed seriatim, and Messrs Duggan and Barton then left, I     It was also agreed at this Conference that Mr. Duggan should be available as Mr, de valera&apos;s representative for communication with G.H.Q. arid that a representative should also be available for each Division and Brigade.5,      The Evening papers of July 9th. contained an extract from a special edition of &quot;The Bulletin&quot;, in which the official communique was referred to as &quot;a draft&quot;, and the undertaking entered into by me as well as those by Mr, de Valera were,3134./interpreted
Interpreted differently.   Although the general spirit of these undertakings was not to any very considerable extent affected, there were certain obvious points of difference on which disagreement might subsequently occur.     In order, therefore., to obviate future misunderstandings I issued to the troops an explanation of the discrepancy between the two documents -copies of which will be found in Appendix V (b) and (o) of this report.     A copy of this explanation was also sent to Mr. Duggan as u&apos;ir. de Valera &apos;s representative, but at the request of Mr. Cope, Assistant Under Secretary, who took exception to my wordin no copy was sent by me to the Press.6.      In everything that has been officially said or done during the last few days I have been careful to ensure that there should be nothing which might in anyway be interpreted as a recognition of the Irish Republican Army as a belligerent, force.     1 consider this of prime importance as such apparent recognition would have a most disastrous  effect on any future operations which may become necessary should negotiations break down.7.      The feelings of Officers and men under my Command at the turn events have taken may I think be described as somewhat mixed.    The prominent features are feelings of humiliation, disappointment, anxiety and, at any rate in the South West, of ^eebtid&amp;Ewi.   Humiliation that) even in so worthy a cause as the restoration of peace in this distracted country, it should be necessary to discuss terms with men they have been taught to consider the organisers of the murders of their comrades; disappointment&apos; that, just as it appeared possible that firm and decisive steps in dealing with the situation were about to be initiated, those responsible for the orgy of outrage of the past eighteen months should escape their just punishment^ anxiety lest the snowball of concession should develop into an avalanche - and scepticism as regards the ability of the leaders of the I.R.A, to control their more militant followers.8,      I regret to say that from the date of the publication in the Press of the undertakings entered into by Mr. de Valera and myself up to noon July 11th, when these undertakings took effect there has been an increase in the number of outrages perpetrat-ed by the rebels.     These will be found tabulated separately in Appendix 1(a) of this report.Serious riots occurred in Belfast on the night of July 10/lltht as a result of the shooting of two policemen, in the city and at the request of the Cabinet of the &quot;Northern Parliament, I hi.re authorised the Colonel Commandant of the 15th. Infantry Brigade to re-impose Curfew and to take such measures as he may deem necessary to deal with the situation.    At the time of writing some 80 -90 buildings are reported to have been destroyed by fire and about one hundred persons killed or injured.(Sd) C.F.N.
