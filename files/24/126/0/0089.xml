THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.RET.CABINET.GQVERNIiEHT SOHEHE FOR THE EMPLOYMENT OF gX^SgRVIOE MEN TO BE TRAINED IN THE BUILDING INDUSTRY.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OP LABOUR.(1).    My Colleagues will be familiar with the efforts ?Ll which.the Government have made Bince July 1919, to seourean increase in the number of Bkllled operatives in tho Building Trades with a view both to the aooeleration of the housing schemes and tho provision of employment for ex-Service men.    There wore prolonged negotiations between various Ministers and representatives of the Building Trade Unions and eventually in October 1920, the Minister of Health (Dr. Addison) In a formal communication on behalf of the Government to tho National Federation of Building Trades Operatives intimated that in the Government1s view 50,000 ex-Sorvlce men could bo absorbed into the industry.    Further diocussions took place but it was found impossible to reach an agreement.&apos;-, (2).    The matter waB reported to the Cabinet on the 7th February by the Committee, over which the Secretary for Scotland presided (CP. 2570), and it was decided that the Prime Minister should see the representatives of the National Federation of Building Trades&apos; Employers,    Two interviews took place on the 11th and 18th February, as a result of which the Employers1 Federation decided to proceed/with
with the scheme for the absorption of 50,000 ex-Service men into the Building Industry; but the present position is so unsatisfactory that I think the Oabinet should have the whole position under review.(3).    The details of the Scheme were worked out by my Department and tho Employers&apos; Federation in conjunction, and arrangoments wore made for Government Departments to co-operate with the Building Trade^Bmployere in employing ex-Service men under its provisions.(4).     Tho National Federation of Building Trades&apos; Employers and the Associated Employers * Organisations in Scotland decided that the Scheme should come into operation on 18th April.(5).    The date fixed was undoubtedly unfortunate. Trade at the time was depressed and the arrears of urgent private building work had been overtaken.    Added to this difficulty oame the coal dispute and the attendant complete-stagnation of industry.If the result of these difficulties had been shewn only in slow progress in the engagement of ex-Service mon applying for employment under the Scheme, the position would have been intelligible.    What, however, has concerned me has been the laxiiy of the employers in setting up their machinery to work the Scheme.I have been in olose touch with them throughout and have made it quite dear to them that the Government regards as a matter of vital importance the fulfilment of the obligations to ex-Service men under tho Scheme which the employers have assumed by pledging themselves to co-operate in working it.    I met representatives of the/Federation
Federation on 29th\Tune and pointed out to them that, whilst appreciating the difficulties which had been caused by the coal dispute, I could not see that any reason existed why they should not have made more progress in Betting up their machinery of District Committees.    They admitted that they had been lax in this and they undertook to exert every effort to see that tho machinery was completed as soon as possible.    I told thorn further that, the coal dispute having now been settled, they Bhould proceed as quickly as possible with the engagement of sx-Servi*e men.(6).    Four weeks have now elapsed and I regret that the results appear still to be quite inappreciable.    Only very few additional Distriot Committees have been established in the interval, and the number of ex-Service men reported as accepted under the Scheme by private employers is not more than about 126 out of over 21,000 applicants, or little more than \$ of the applications received.(7).    The present position with regard to men accepted for employment may be summarised as follows ?-Numbor of Men London.   Remainder of Total.Accepted by Country.TajPrivate Employers 83 43 126(birGovernment Departments.      39 37 76202.Not a single private employer is recorded as having engaged a man in the important North Western Division, in Scotland or in Wales, and in Yorkshire and the East Midlands only one man is reported to have been engaged by a private employer.
(8).    So far as Government-Departments are oonoerned there can be no question that they have worked the Scheme to a greater extent than private employers, as they have taken on 76 ex-Sorvice men as compared with 126 by private employers.    Tho Offioe of Works in particular has shewn itself active and it reports that Trade Union Officials are constantly questioning its action in working the Soherae in view of the alleged faot that private employers are doing nothing to forward the matter.    The representatives of the Employers&apos; Federation whom I have met admit quite frankly that the Office of Works has more than fulfilled the Government undertaking to co-operate with the employers. In addition to the steps which Departments have taken with regard to tho direct employment of ox-Service men, they have circularised all their contractors impressing upon them the necessity of employing ex-Service men under the Scheme on current contracts and they have drawn their attention to the fact that as from the 1st September, contracts for Government Departments will only he let, Bave in exceptional circumstances, on condition that the contractors are participating in the Scheme.    The Ministry of Health and the Scottish Board of Health have both taken * aotion on similar lines with regard to housing schemes.(9).    I have had a further meeting with representatives of the National Federation of Building Trades Employers and I have oome to the conclusion that the root difficulty appears to be the total lack of mutual confidence and loyalty among the ranks of employers.    Each is afraid to start because he doubts the baoking of his fellows.    If/only
only the can be overoome progroeo is possible.    The Office of Works has proved it by experience, for it finds that once ex-Service men havo been introduced on to a job and started work the hostile attitude of the trade unionists tonds to die down and the progress of some of the ex-Sorvioo men has been extraordinarily good, particularly amongst the plasterers.(10).    I think that evory effort will have to be concentrated on removing this mutual suspicion that prevails among employers and creating confidence.    Considerable prejudice will have to be surmounted as a result of the revision of the Government Housing Programme.    It will no doubt be suggested that this has so profoundly modified the circumstances that action on the original linoo of the Scheme is no longer possiblet    But in practice even the curtailed Housing Programmo offers ample openings for ex-Service men trainees.    According to Ministry of Health figures on housing operations in progress on 30th June,*3,408 bricklayers, plasterers, slators, and tilera (the classes to which the scheme applies at present) were required,and it is understood that of the 200,000 houses covered byhousing eohemes and subsidy assistance houses completed andin courso of erection account for only somo 60,000.    At my request the Ministry of Health has just obtained information with regard to the number of men engaged under the scheme on current housing operations.    The returns are veryfragmentary but from SOS returns reeeivod in respect of housing schemes of 50 houses and over apparently only 90/ex-Service
ex-Service men are being employed by private firms, and this figure undoubtedly includes some men who have been engaged under the Disabled Men&apos;s Training Scheme or under private arrangements.    It can be assumed that this is a fair cample.    The returns represent both federated employers and non-federated firms.     The latter are under no pledges, the former are, and nothing can he more discreditable to them.    Circumstances have not altered so profoundly since the scheme was launched as to absolve tho federated employers from all obligation to the 21,000 ex-Service men who have asked for training on the strength of the employers&apos; pledges. Ab I havo explained there is ample opening for ex-Service men even on tho revised Housing Programme and it is fair to assume that the reductions in the cost of labour and materials which have been taking place recently will revive the demand for building work other than housing.     In this connection I desire to point out that the.Employers&apos; Federation expressly stipulated with the Government that they should be allowed to employ ex-Service men under the Scheme on private work as well as on housing.(11).     I must confess to very great disappointment at the failure of the Employers1 Federation, to make good on this Scheme.     Their pledges to the Prime Minister were quite specific and the policy of the Executive of the Federation received the endorsement of the constituent members of the Federation throughout the country.    This policy has just been endorsed anew by the Federation at its half-yearly meeting on the 27th July, at Sheffield, when a resolution was passed unanimously expressing regret that circumstances have/prevented
prevented... the success of the Scheme and determination to proceed forthwith to put the Schemo into operation throughout the country.    It is one thing for a resolution to he passed unanimously, at a delegate meeting.    It is another thing to secure its translation into action by individual employers.    The Government cannot afford to have it said that they have invited applications for training from over 21,000 unemployed ex-Service men on the strength of explicit promises which the employers have so far done nothing to redeem.    I think the time has come - and the resolution of the Federation affords a valuable opportunity - when the Prime Minister should again see the representatives of the Employers and impress upon them the necessity for at last translating their words into immediate and effective aotIon,(Sgd.)
