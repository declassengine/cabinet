JThte Document Is the Property of ftla Britannic Malo3ty&apos;3 Government.Supreme Court Officers Bill.MEMORANDUM.1. The objects of this Bill are - ,(1) to fix an age for the compulsory retirement of certain officers of the Supreme Court;(2) to provide for the payment of pensions to certain of these officers on a more favour-able scale than that applicable to ordinary Civil servants; \(3) to provide for the appointment, conditions of service and retirement of the registrars and the clerks to registrars of the Chancery Division;(4) to give power to the Lord Chancellor to abolish unnecessary offices in the Supreme Court.2. Clause 1 of the Bill carries out the first of these objects by providing that any person holding any of the offices mentioned in the Eirst Schedule to the Bill shall retire at the completion of the year of service in which he attains the age of 72 years, or with the consent of the Lord Chancellor a later age not exceeding 75 years.At present there is no retiring age for these officers, and there is no power to remove them unless they are &quot;afflicted with any infirmity which disables them from the due execution of their office.&quot; The natural result of this system has been to retain in office men who were too old to discharge properly the duties of their offices. The -Royal Commission on the Civil Service which reported in 1915 recommended the imposition of a retiring age, but this cannot be done without statutory authority.The retiring age fixed by the Bill is the same as that fixed for county court judges by the County Court Judges (Retirement Pensions and Deputies) Act, 1919.3. Clause 2 of the Bill provides for the payment to persons holding the Supreme Court offices mentioned in Parti, of the Eirst Schedule of superannuation allowances on special terms.By s. 15 of the Supreme Court of Justice (Officers) Act, 1879, officers of the Supreme Court are deemed to be permanent civil servants for the purposes of pensions, but147-2A
1 4(  2  )Uby s. 17 of that. Act power is given to the Lord Chancellor and the Treasury to add years not exceeding 20 for the purpose of reckoning the number of years service which may be computed for pension purposes in the case of certain officers of the Supreme Court.Orders have Been made under that section adding different numbers of years in different cases. The numbers added appear to be based on no principle, e.y., the number of added years in the case of Kings Bench Masters is 7, and in the case of the Official Referees, taxing masters and Chancery masters is 10. The Official Referees and King&apos;s Bench Masters are drawn from precisely the same class, and there is no reason why 10 years should be necessary in one case and 7 in the other. Chancery masters and taxing masters are drawn from another class, in whose case it would be more suit-able that they should have the lesser rather than the greater number of added years.The principle of added years, however, has been abolished as regards the Civil Service generally by the Superannuation Act, 1914, and the power to add years for the purpose of Civil Service pensions no longer exists except in so far as it is authorised by section 17 of the Act of 1879. It is impossible, having regard to the age at which the officers in question are appointed and the neces-sity of maintaining a high standard of qualification among them that added years should be abolished, unless some equivalent advantage is given. Accordingly subs. (1) of this clause provides for a new method of reckoning pensions in the case of these officers, which will be more beneficial to them than the existing system. The new system gives an allowance equal to ten-sixtieths of the annual salary after five years service with an addition of one-fortieth of the annual salary for each years service after the first five.Officers appointed before the 1st January, 1920, or who, if appointed subsequently, are Civil Servants at the time of their appointment, are given the option of either continuing under the existing system or of adopting the provisions of the Bill. Existing officers who are at present subject to the provisions of the Superannuation Act, 1909, are given the further option of adopting the provisions of the Third Schedule to the Bill in substitution for those contained in the Second Schedule.
A pension ivill not be granted except upon medical certificate to an officer retiring under the age of 72 years unless he has served 15 years and has attained the age of 65 years.4. Clause 3 regularises the position of the Chancery registrars.By virtue of the Court of Chancery Act, 1841, there are 10 Chancery registrars who are appointed from among the clerks to the registrars; there are 12 clerks to the registrars who must be admitted solicitors or articled clerks who have served under articles for five years, and each of the clerks are to be promoted according to seniority unless sufficient objection is made to the satisfaction vof the Lord Chancellor. Many of these provisions have already been violated. The registrars have been reduced and at the end of the present year it is expected that their numbers will be three, and it is not proposed to fill up more than three vacancies.It is also necessary to get rid of the provision for the promotion of clerks according to seniority. Cases occur in which a clerk who is entitled to promotion is not a man whom the Lord Chancellor would select for the purpose, and although in the Act of 1841 &quot; sufficient objection to &quot; the satisfaction of the Lord Chancellor&quot; may enable such a person to be passed over, there have been grave doubts whether such a case would amount to &quot; sufficient objection &quot; or not.There is also the further difficulty that by the Act of 1841 clerks to the registrars must be persons who have been admitted solicitors or articled clerks or who have served under articles for five years. Some of the persons now exercising the functions of clerk to the registrar have not got these necessary qualifications. Accordingly it has been necessary to regularise these cases, and this is effected by subsection (5) of this clause.5. Clause 5 gives power to the Lord Chancellor to abolish any office in the Supreme Court which appears to him to be unnecessary.In certain cases, however, officers are appointed by the Lord Chief Justice, Master of the Rolls, and the President of the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division. In those cases it is provided that the office shall not be abolished without the consent of the person having power to appoint.147 A 2
5. It is essential that the provisions of the Bill relating to Chancery Registrars and their clerks should be passed into law this year, in the first place for the purpose of putting straight the very serious irregularities and sur-mounting the difficulties which have been pointed out above, and in the second place in order to take advantage of the vacancies among the registrars which are antici-pated at the end of the year, so as to reduce their number permanently from 10 to 6.6. As regards the rest of the Bill, it is also extremely desirable that it should be passed into law as soon as possible. Negotiations have been entered into with existing officers, who have been given to understand that legislation would be introduced at an early date, and numerous provisional arrangements have been made for the retirement of particular individuals. These arrange-ments cannot be carried out and these pledges cannot be fulfilled unless the Bill is passed.The reduction of Chancery Masters from 12 to 10 (or as it will be, 9 upon the next retirement), of Chancery Registrars from 10 to 6, of registrars&apos; clerks from 12 to 6, and of taxing masters from 11 to 6, was only possible upon the understanding that the officers in the reduced establishments would be persons fit for their work, and inefficient officers cannot be got rid of unless the Bill becomes law.There is at present a substantial amount of agree-ment between the officers of the Supreme Court in accepting the provisions of this Bill, but every year&apos;s delay makes such agreement less likely, and the position is complicated upon every new appointment made before the passing of this Bill.7. The provisions of the Bill will, it may be confi-dently anticipated, result eventually in a large measure of economy, and some saving will be effected forthwith.The fact that there has hitherto been no retiring age has, as has been said above, resulted in retaining in office men who were too old or too infirm properly to discharge their duties, and the establishment has accordingly been maintained at too great a numercial strength having regard to the amount of work to be done.
