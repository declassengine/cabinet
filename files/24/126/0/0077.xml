De valera with me have been observed by the Sinn 3J&apos;ein party with the exception of certain cases which have been reported of drilling, and of the collection of funds ill the streets, in restaurants, at church doors, and by house to house visits, for the benefit of the I,R.A,There has been some difficulty with the individuals selected for liaison purposes.    These individuals decline to accept any communications addressed to them except as officers of the I,R,A, entitled to the rank of Commandant.   This recognition of the I,R.A, I have declined to allow, as I consider it will mean th^t if activities re-commence, they will at bnce use this fact as a proof that they are belligerents and not rebels.   In Dublin the difficulty has been got over by restricting communications to the telephone, but in the Martial Law Area Mr, Thomas Barry and his colleagues have refused to answer calls on the telephone and have returned letters sent to them by hand and through the post with the result thatcommunication with them has been broken off.     This will., I anticipate, make but little difference, as 7!r, ThomasBarry, a student who appears to be about 23 years of age,with an exaggerated opinion of his own importance was not likelyto be of any assistance in making matters run smoothly,No difficulties in this connection have occurred in the 5thDivisional area, chiefly, I think, because the men selected bySinn 3?ein- for liaison work are desirous of making mattersNrunsmoothly during this somewhat difficult period, and because theyiare acting chiefly with the police authorities.   I am examining
the jp^3ETlMlit7s^ to thoMartial Lav/ Aroa, in the event of liaison being re^uiired^birt-at present we get on very well without it.Under instructions .from&apos; the Civil Government Madame MarlclovicB and Joseph MeGrath have been released from prison and internment oaffip respectivelya   The reason for their releases is that both these individuals hold appointments approximating to Cabinet Ministers in the Southern Parliament9 and having influence with the women and labour respectively, their assistance is required by Mr, De Valera in considering the. terms presented to him by the Prime Minister0As far as can be gathered the opinion of the country is in favour of the continuation of peaceful conditions, but until it^ is known what terms have been offered to Mr* De Valera it will, not bs possible to forecast the probable turn of events,  he cessation of activities appears to have affected the various classes of the community as follows       .TH3&quot; * is delighted with the possibilities of a permanent settlement and the prospect of saving his harvests   He does not care whether the terms of the settlement are Home Rule,or a Republic so long as it will not affect his pockets gEglgHOPMPKR w is anxious to establish friendship with the Crown 3?oroes and obtain their patronage *   Like the farmer they era not at present interested in the terms of the settlements They are tired of the rebellion but are afraid to say so and as usual are still trying to keep in with both sideSs. gag REBEL LEADERS,   Few have returned to their homes as they are apparently still doubtful as to their reception^   Those who have returned maintain a disinterested air and state that they do not mind what the result of the present &quot;conversations&quot; will be   They are ready to resume operations if necessary^ In this connection it is reported that in addition, to the drilling^ collection.of funds for IcJUAw purposes and
tintelligenoe&quot; and..,propaganda work,that..is,&quot;being actively^carried on, all young men are being warned that their services will he called upon in the event of the negotiations breaking down. RftBEL RANK &amp; FXLS.,   In most districts these are glad of tho opportunity of returning to their homes and it will be some time before their Commandants will succeed in mobilising them again, hut others who have had more experience of I methods know that they will have to go if called upon to do sa and would leave the country if they could afford lt0 In West Cork and in some parts of the County Limerick the rebels look upon tho present &quot;T^uce&quot; simply as an adjournment of operations which will enable them to recuperate and resume hostilities when Winter comes in and the conditions will be favourable to them.It is Impossible to say whether arms are stiS.1 being imported^TB3B LOYALISTa   The Loyalist is generally pessimistic0   He cannot understand tho present attitude of tho- Government in discussing peace terms with what he must-always look upon as a Murder. Gangs   few have any faith in the prospect of anything like a settlement whioh would be fair to them,,In the meantime training of an elementary nature is being carried out-, the main object at present being to exercirse as many men in musketry as the situation-and range accommodation will admit, for example ;i- eight infantry companies and one squadron are firing at KILBRIEEU   Artillery practice is being carried out by 4th Brigade R.H*A* at GLSI IKAAL practice Camp and the Worth Ireland Ocast Defences are carrying out gunnery practice at KI1S00T,Should&apos; there be no resumption of rebel activities it is intended that another Brigade R5J&apos;-,A?. and a Brigade RaGr0A* should attend the practice Camp at GLEN IMAAL0
