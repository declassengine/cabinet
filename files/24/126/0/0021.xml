This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. 112SECRET.CP. 3121.14THE CABINET.THE MILITARY POSITION IN SILESIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate a note by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, with which I am in entire agreement.L. W.-E.Sth July, 1921.01545755From Sir H. Stuarfs telegram No. 249, 6th July, it appears that the final withdrawal, both of the Polish insurgents and of the German forces, has now been completed.It may be taken, therefore, that the object for which British troops were sent to Upper Silesia, viz., the re-establishment of the authority of the Inter-Allied Commission, has now been achieved.In these circumstances, I suggest that General Heneker&apos;s force be now withdrawn to the Rhine, where they will be readily available in the event of future disturbances rendering it necessary again to send troops to Silesia. Unless the British contingent is withdrawn now, I see every probability of their being kept in Silesia until well into the autumn, or even longer. For it must obviously be some weeks or even months before a final decision as to the Silesian frontier can be given, and whatever that decision may be we may rest assured that it will be extremely unpopular with the malcontents on each side, and a period of great unrest will ensue, during which it would be impossible to withdraw Allied troops. On the other hand, from the present moment until the decision is promulgated, there is likely to he a period of quiescence, in view of the fact that the glamour of the insurrectionary movement has died, out, and the harvest which is now about to begin is likely to absorb the superfluous energies of the more turbulent elements.I would therefore urge that the present favourable opportunity may be seized to wind up our commitments in this area.H. W., C.I.G.S.8th July, 1921.(B21 /256)   100  7/21   H&amp;S Ltd.  9336wo
