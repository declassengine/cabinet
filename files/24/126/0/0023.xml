REPORT ON MIDDLE EAST CONFERENCE HELD IN CAIRO AND JERUSALEM, MARCH 12 TO 30, 1921.I.-EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE CONFERENCE AND procedure adopted.1. ON the 14th February, 1921, the Cabinet met to consider the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee which had been appointed by the Prime Minister to make recommendations as to the formation of a new Department under the Colonial Office to deal with mandated and other territories in the Middle East (Appendix 1).The Cabinet decided to approve generally the recommendations contained in the Report on the understanding: (i.) That this approval involved no modification of the present arrange-ments, under which the revenues of the Government of India bore a portion of Middle Eastern expenditure; and(ii.) That the Committee&apos;s proposals should, before being put into force, be communicated to and approved by the Government of India.They also agreed that the Secretary of State for the Colonies should be authorised to visit Egypt in the early part of March for the purpose of consulting with the British authorities in Palestine and Arabia as proposed.2. The Secretary of State for the Colonies immediately commenced the formation of the new Department, which was to take over from the Foreign Office, India Office and War Office on the 1st March. He had recommended to the Cabinet that, in order to ensure the immediate carrying out of the necessary measures to effect economies in the Middle East, it would be*necessary for him to hold a Conference at some convenient centre, where he could meet, and discuss outstanding questions with, the responsible civil and military officials in the areas whose control had been transferred to the Colonial Office. The most convenient meeting-place was Cairo, and, as soon as it was confirmed that there was no local objection, arrangements were made for the High Commissioners and General Officers Commanding in Palestine and Mesopotamia, the General Officer Corn-man ding in Persia, the Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Governor of Somaliland, and the Resident at Aden, with such staffs as they might consider necessary, to meet there early in March.3. Provisional agenda were at the same time prepared by the Middle East Department and communicated by telegraph to all concerned. The departmental view on the questions to be discussed was submitted to the Secretary of State before his departure, after it had been discussed confidentially with a number of officers of local experience who happened to be in London at the time (Appendix 2).4. On the 1st March the Secretary of State left London for Egypt, accom-panied by Air-Marshal Sir Hugh Trenchard, K.C.B., D.S.O., Chief of the Air Staff, and officials of the Middle East Department. Major-General Sir P. P. de B. Radcliffe, K.C.M.G., C.B., D.S.O., Director of Military Operations, Mr. J. B. Crosland, Finance Department of the War Office, and Sir George Barstow, K.C.B., Treasury, joined the party at Cairo.   During the voyage from Marseilles[6117] ^ B 2
to Alexandria, a programme for the Conference was approved by the Secretary of State (Appendix 3), and more detailed agenda prepared for the first discussions on Mesopotamia (Appendix 5). Lieutenant-General Sir Walter Congreve, V.C., K.C.B., Commander-in-Chief in Egypt and Palestine, who was returning to Alexandria by the same ship as the Secretary of State, most kindly consented to act as Chairman of the Military and Financial Committee throughout the entire Conference. To his unfailing tact and resource the complete unanimity, which was such a striking feature of the Conference, was very largely due.5. A list of Members of the Conference, by Missions, will be found in Appendix 4. The first session was held on the 12th March, when the Secretary of State explained his object in calling the Conference, and outlined the programme to be followed. The Conference then split up into Committees, the composition of which varied with the subject under discussion, but which may be classified under the two main heads of Political and Military. Mr. R. D. Badcock, M.C., whose services were lent by the High Commissioner for Palestine, acted as Secretary to the Conference as a whole, and also to all Political Committees. The services of Lieutenant-Colonel B. H. Waters-Taylor, C.B.E., were similarly placed at the disposal of the Secretary of State by the Commander-in-Chief, Egypt and Palestine, as Secretary to the Military Committees. It reflects great credit upon these two officers, and especially upon Mr. Badcock, who made all arrangements for providing a temporary Secretariat, that such a full and accurate record was kept of between forty and fifty Committee meetings held between the 12th and the 24th March.6. On the night of the 23rd March the Secretary of State left Cairo for Jerusalem, where further meetings were held to discuss questions affecting Palestine and Trans-Jordania, representative deputations were received, and visits paid to outlying districts. On the same day Sir George Barstow arrived in Cairo from London and presided over meetings .which considered various financial questions relating to Mesopotamia. The Missions from Mesopotamia, Aden and Somaliland left Cairo on the 25th March, the Financial Adviser to the High Commissioner for Mesopotamia remaining until the 27th in order to complete the discussion of financial matters with Sir George Barstow, who then left Cairo for Jerusalem.7. A summary of the conclusions arrived at will be found in the succeeding sections of this report, to which the minutes of the more important Committee meetings are attached as appendices.II.-MESOPOTAMIA.1. The main Mesopotamian agenda (Appendix 5). were discussed by two Committees: a Political Committee, presided over by the Secretary of State (Appendix 6), and a Military and Financial Committee, presided over by Sir Walter Congreve (Appendix 7). These two Committees also met together as a combined Committee, under the Secretary of State (Appendix 8), when the political and military proposals were considered side by side and co-ordinated. Sub-Committees of this combined Committee considered detailed questions relating to the distribution of troops and the respective roles of military and air forces.2. The Conference decided that political conditions involved the necessity for a Sherifian ruler to be selected for Mesopotamia, and that the most Suitable ruler was the Emir Feisal. It was fully realised that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not nominate Feisal, but that he must be chosen by the people of Mesopotamia. At the same time it was felt that without his actual presence in the country it was possible that the activities of local candidates might prejudice his claims. It was also necessary to consider French susceptibilities, and a detailed programme was worked out for the successive steps necessary to ensure Nthe best possible chance of Feisal being selected by the people of Mesopotamia as their ruler without His Majesty&apos;s Government taking too active a part in pressing for his acceptance (Appendix 9).3. On the assumption that the programme could be satisfactorily carried out, the Conference decided that the garrison of Mesopotamia could be reduced to a total of twenty-three battalions as fast as shipping could be made available. Proportionate reductions of staffs, auxiliary services of all kinds, followers and animals would follow.   It was estimated that the resultant saving in the estimate[6117]
for Palestine and Mesopotamia in 1921-22 would amount to 5  millions, provided that prompt action was taken at all points. A further saving would result if the Government of India could be induced to shorten the time during which Indian troops remained on Imperial charge after repatriation to India. It was not proposed that the garrison should be reduced below the twenty-three battalion scale until after the hot weather. Meanwhile steps were recommended in order to facilitate a further reduction in October.4. The Conference realised that any attempt to force purely Kurdish districts under the rule of an Arab Government would inevitably be resisted (Appendix 10). They accordingly recommended that, until such time as a representative body of Kurdish opinion might opt for inclusion in Iraq, Kurdistan should be dealt with direct by the High Commissioner, and kept separate from Iraq itself. The advantage of this solution would be that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be enabled to recruit Kurdish units under British officers, and thus to improvise a force which was more likely to be in a position to take over from the British garrison the defence of the frontier than an Arab army officered entirely by Arabs (Appendix 11). It was recognised that the existing force of Arab levies under British officers must for the present remain in existence, though political considerations demanded that measures should at the same time be adopted for the raising of a purely Arab army. It was accordingly decided that the existing Arab levies should be expanded by the addition of Kurdish and Assyrian units, and also by the recruitment of Arabs to replace the Kurdish elements in the existing organisation. By this means it w&apos;as hoped to effect the early withdrawal of the Imperial garrisons in Kirkuk and other frontier districts. Speed, combined with maximum efficiency, was the object of this arrangement, and it was anticipated that, as the Arab army grew and became capable of taking over the whole country, the levy organisation, except in Kurdistan, would gradually disappear. The cost-of the levy organisation would be borne on the Colonial Office vote, subject to a possible contribution by the Mesopotamian Government. The cost of the Arab army, on the other hand, would be borne entirely on Mesopotamian revenues, and would constitute for the year 1921-22 the contri-bution of that Government towards the cost of Mesopotamian defence.5. Assuming that the country remained quiet internally and was not disturbed from outside, that the Arab Government proved a success, and that good progress were made in the training of the local levies and the development of the Arab army, it was hoped that a further reduction in the Imperial garrison to a twelve battalion scale, with further resultant savings, might take place in October, but this would of course be contingent upon events (Appendix 12).6. The Conference then discussed the normal or permanent garrison for Mesopotamia, which it was hoped to reach some time in the year 1922-23.A scheme for the control of Mesopotamia by the Royal Air Force was submitted by the Chief of the Air Staff andvapproved in principle by the Conference - (Appendix 13). If this scheme were brought into operation, the Imperial garrison in Mesopotamia would eventually be reduced to 1 brigade and 1 pack battery. The&apos;alternative would be the retention in Mesopotamia of an Imperial garrison of 12 battalions of infantry, 1 cavalry regiment, 1 field battery, 1 pack battery, 1 sapper and miner company and 5 squadrons of the Royal Air Force. The Conference recommended that, in calculating the comparative advantages of these two alternatives, consideration should be given to the vital necessity of preparing and training an Air Force adequate to war requirements, the importance of testing the potentialities of the Air Force, the need for giving to superior officers and staffs experience in independent command and responsibility, and the provision of an all-British military and commercial air route to India (Section V, paragraph 3).7. The following recommendations were made for the immediate disposal of the various refugees who were being&apos; maintained at the cost of the Imperial exchequer in Mesopotamia (Appendix 14): (a.) Armenians. There were 14,000 Armenian refugees at Basra, who could neither be repatriated by land nor absorbed into the population of the country. No provision had been made for their maintenance during the financial year 1921-22. It was clear that they could not remain indefinitely in Mesopotamia, and the Conference accordingly recom-mended that they should be shipped forthwith to some port on the Black Sea, the Foreign Office being asked to recommend which locality was most suitable, in the light of the Turkish situation.
(b.) Russians. There were some 800 Russian refugees at Basra who had been evacuated from Enzeli by the War Office under conditions arranged with the local Bolshevik commander. The Conference considered that they were in exactly the same position as the Russian refugees awaiting repatriation in Egypt. They -would almost certainly be executed if they were sent back to Russia, as they were for the most part very obnoxious to the Bolshevik Government. It was realised that the time had not yet arrived for their repatriation, but it was considered desirable both from a humanitarian and from an economic point of view that they should be removed from Basra, where considerable mortality would be caused among them by the hot weather, to Egypt where their compatriots were being well looked after and assisted to some extent by local charities, the Conference accordingly recom-mended that they should be shipped immediately to Egypt with the exception of a few who might possibly obtain employment in Mesopotamia. The only alternative was that they should be shipped to Constantinople where the problem of the disposal of the large number of Russian refugees already there would not be materially affected by the influx of so small a number as 800.(c.) Assyrians. The High Commissioner for Mesopotamia had already warned all the Assyrian refugees that no funds would be available for their maintenance during the financial year 1921-22, and that on the 1st April steps would be taken to close&apos; down the refugee camps. The Assyrians fell under two categories : Urumians and mountaineers. The Urumians were those who had had already one chance of repatriation but had turned back owing to severe winter conditions. The Conference under-stood that there was no real prospect of these refugees being received either by the United States of America or in the French zone in Syria. They could not be absorbed into the local population of Mesopotamia, and no destination suggested itself to which they could be shipped. The Conference considered that there was no alternative but to give them some arms for their protection, and to turn them out to make their way back if they could to their own country. A small number might possibly be assisted by American charity, and some might enlist in the new levies.&quot;With regard to the mountaineers the Conference recommended that they should be settled locally in conjunction with the new levy scheme. It was proposed that a few Assyrian companies should be raised under British officers and distributed along the frontier in localities where there appeared to be reasonable prospect of small Assyrian communities being settled down. It was anticipated that this would involve a total maximum expenditure of 200,000Z. to meet the cost of providing them with agricultural implements, &amp;c. The Conference recommended that this should be done, the expenditure involved being included in the proposed grant-in-aid for Mesopotamia.8. Various financial questions were discussed in the first place by Committees under the Secretary of State, and provisional conclusions were arrived at, which were discussed with Sir George Barstow after the Secretary of State had left Cairo for Jerusalem (Appendix 15). Sir George Barstow&apos;s final recommendations as approved by the Secretary of State were on the following general lines: The Imperial Government to be responsible for any net difference between the expenditure and receipts (on a cash basis) whether civil or military, in Mesopotamia up to 31st March, 1921, Capital assets derived from military expenditure from vote of credit or army funds, e.g., railways, port, electric appliances, telegraphs, &amp;c, to be vested in the Colonial Office as from the 1st April, 1921, but as a general principle all properties which had been paid for by civil revenues, as shown in expenditure accounts of the civil administration of Mesopotamia, to be vested in the Mesopotamian Government. The Imperial assets to be disposed of as soon as convenient, as far as possible to the Mesopotamian Government at a fair valuation, failing this to private persons or companies. Payments by the Mesopotamian Government would probably not be made in cash, but would constitute an interest bearing debt due by Mesopotamia to the Home Government. Payment of interest might be deferred until the finances of Mesopotamia were in a position to bear them.  The Mesopotamian budget should in future meet all civil charges, and in
addition provide a contribution to Imperial military charges. This contribution would for the present take the form of provision made for an Arab army to enable Imperial forces to be reduced. The local levies, Arab, Kurdish and Assyrian, would be regarded as Imperial forces.9. Railway capital charges could not be met from current revenues of Mesopotamia (Appendix 16). An offer was made by Sir Arnold Wilson, on behalf of Messrs. Strick, Scott and Co., to purchase the Mesopotamian railways. The Secretary of State considered that it was inadvisable to accept this offer, more especially as the Company demanded a guarantee from his Majesty&apos;s Government. He was of opinion that if the hot weather passed quietly, and the policy suggested by the Qonference proved successful, more advantageous offers could be expected in the future than were then justified. It was estimated that an expenditure of 325,O00Z. would be required during the year 1921-22 as the first part of a scheme of reconstruction and reconditioning of the Mesopotamian railways, which might eventually require as much as 6,000,000Z. In order to relieve the administration of the liability of finding fresh capital for the railways, it was considered desirable that a bargain should be struck with private enterprise as early as possible, hut it was not anticipated that this could be done until the political outlook was more settled.III.-PALESTINE.1. The Palestine Mission under Sir Herbert Samuel arrived in Cairo on the 16th March &quot;and left on the 23rd for Jerusalem with the Secretary of State.The outstanding question to be discussed was the policy to be adopted with regard to Trans-Jordania, and its effect upon the strength of the Imperial garrison in Palestine. A combined political and military committee under the Secretary of State considered this question (Appendix 17), and arrived at provisional conclusions, which were then referred to a military committee (Appendix 18). The Conference recommended that Trans-Jordania should be constituted an Arab province of Palestine under an Arab governor, responsible to the High Commis-sioner. On this assumption they recommended the immediate military occupation of Trans-Jordania, without which they understood that it would be impossible to secure a settled government there or to stop anti-French action initiated in the British zone. These recommendations were, however, dependent upon the attitude adopted by the Emir Abdullah, and were subsequently modified as a result of interviews between the Secretary of State and the Emir which were held in Jerusalem on the 28th, 29th and 30th March (Appendix 19). In the course of these conversations it became quite clear, not only that the Emir was unwilling to become governor of Trans-Jordania himself under the High Commissioner, but also that he was not prepared to recommend a candidate for this appointment. He had himself announced his intention of taking a leading part in anti-French action, and the people of the district were expecting him to persist in this, policy. When the policy recommended by the Conference for Mesopotamia, and for Arabia generally (section V, paragraph 2) was explained to him, he realised that for him to persist in active measures against the French would conflict with the interests of the Sherifian family and permanently alienate them from His Majesty&apos;s Government. His own suggestion was that an Arab Emir should be appointed for Palestine and Trans-Jordania, who should be in the same relations with the High Commissioner for Palestine as the future Emir of Mesopotamia with the High Commissioner for that country. It was explained to him that His Majesty&apos;s Government were already too far committed to a different system in Palestine for them to be able to adopt this proposal. He reluctantly accepted this, but proceeded to suggest that Trans-Jordania should be incorporated with Mesopotamia. He was told that this was also impossible. He then agreed to do his best to keep Trans-Jordania quiet during the month which must elapse before his father and brother could be consulted about the original proposal that it should be constituted an Arab province of Palestine. It was realised that he was being asked to undertake a very difficult task, and it was eventually suggested to him that he should make himself responsible for Trans-Jordania for the period of six months, during which time he . would be assisted financially by His Majesty&apos;s Government, who would also help him to organise local forces under British officers. It was pointed out to him that if he succeeded in checking anti-French action for six months he would not only convince the French Government that, so jFar from being actively hostile to them,
the Sherifian family was prepared loyally to co-operate with His Majesty&apos;s Government in protecting them from external aggression, and would thus reduce their opposition to his brother&apos;s candidature for Mesopotamia, but he would also greatly improve his own chances of a personal reconciliation with the French, whicli might even lead to his being instated by them as Emir of Syria in Damascus. It was made perfectly clear to him that while they would do everything they could to assist towards the attainment of this object, His Majesty&apos;s Government could not in any way guarantee that it would be achieved. After full consideration he agreed to undertake responsibility for Trans-Jordania for six months. He preferred that military assistance should be given him in the form of aerial support, and assistance in the organisation of local levies under British officers, and said that he did not wish troops to be sent to Amman. As an alternative to the procedure recommended by the Conference this solution appeared preferable to the Secretary of State, both on financial and military grounds, and he accordingly recommended its adoption to the Cabinet on his return to London.2. The question of the composition and recruitment of the Palestine Defence Force was discussed by a committee at Cairo (Appendix 20).The recommendations made by this committee were reviewed in the light of the political decisions taken later at Jerusalem, where further committees were called to discuss this subject (Appendix 21). The original proposal of the High Commissioner for Palestine had been to raise a Defence Force on the militia system. He considered that the duties that would fall to a Palestine Defence Force were not such as to render indispensable the training of the men up to the standard of European armies, however desirable that might be in itself. He had suggested that a training of six months, followed by six months&apos; service in their stations, and then periods of three months in each of the three following years, should suffice to provide a militia effective enough for its purpose, and numerous in proportion to its cost. Two objections were offered to these proposals. From the military point of view it was urged that a training on the militia basis would not provide a force which would be capable of taking the place of Imperial troops. From the political point of view it was pointed out that the terms of service would not appeal to the Arab in the same way that they did to the Jew, and it was feared that the result would be that no Arabs would enter the force. The alternative of enrolling the two elements of the force under different conditions the Jews on a militia basis and the Arabs on a long-service basis was considered and rejected. It was finally decided that the same terms of service should be offered to all namely, short service of two or three years, with the option of extension to long service at the end of that period. As a result of the decision to regard Trans-Jordania as an Arab Province of Palestine, it was decided that the forces raised locally in Trans-Jordania should form part of the Palestine Defence Force. It was suggested that the Circassian element in Trans-Jordania might also be made use of for the formation of mounted troops. The High Commissioner pointed out that the effect of these decisions would be to make the Palestine Defence Force more expensive and to preclude the possibility of its being paid for entirely from Palestine revenues as he had originally suggested. There were two possible alternatives for dealing with the financial aspect of the force. It might either be regarded as a purely Palestine force paid for from Palestinian revenues, with the assistanee of a grant in aid from Imperial funds; or it might be treated on the analogy of the British officered levies in Mesopotamia and regarded as an Imperial force to the expenses of which Palestine revenues would provide an increasing contribution. No final decision was taken on these two alternatives and the Secretary of State desired the High Commissioner to prepare a complete scheme and submit it to him for approval. He undertook that the cost of the units of the force which were raised in Trans-Jordania would in any case be regarded as an Imperial commitment for the present.3. The question of the composition of the Commission on the Holy Places referred to in Article 95 of the Treaty of Sevres and Article 14 of the draft mandate for Palestine was considered by a Committee under the presidency of Sir H. Samuel (Appendix 22), which recommended that the post of Chairman would be most suitably filled by an Englishman of judicial experience and, so far as possible, world-wide reputation. They considered that, provided the members&apos; were not local people and were chosen as much on account of their impartiality as of their religious views, the best composition for the Commission, under a British
chairman, as suggested above, would be two Christians (one Catholic and one Orthodox), two Moslems (both Sunnis) and two Jews (one Zionist and one Orthodox). Sectarian views would be laid before the Commission by panels specially selected by the. respective communities, but forming no part of the Commission. The Committee agreed that the Administration should be represented on the Commission, and considered that the best way to secure this would be by the appointment of a secretary, who would act in a dual capacity as member of the Commission and representative of the Administration. With regard to the payment of members, they recommended that this should be under-taken by the League of Nations or, failing this, by His Majesty&apos;s Government. They did not regard the functions which the Commission would perform as a Palestinian interest, and considered that no payment should be made towards it from the revenues of Palestine.4. The Secretary of State received influential Moslem and Jewish deputations (Appendix 23), and assured them both that there would be no change in the declared policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Balfour declaration contained two distinct promises, one to the Jews and one to the Arabs; both would be fulfilled. He was convinced that the Zionist cause would bring good to the whole world and welfare and advancement to the Arabs of Palestine. He appealed to the Jews to dispel the exaggerated fears of the Arabs by a good and friendly attitude and by the exercise of due restraint as well as of enthusiasm. He advised the Arabs, on the other hand, to give help and encouragement to the Jews, whose success would bring general prosperity and wealth to all Palestinians.IV. ADEN AND SOMALILAND.1. The position with regard to Aden was that the Cabinet had only approved its transfer to the Colonial Office subject to the concurrence of the Government of India in the Report of the Masterton Smith Committee (Appendix 1). On the 21st March the Viceroy telegraphed to the India Office that so far as could then be seen the Government of India were likely to be able to accept the main recommendations of the Report in principle, subject to satisfactory financial adjustments. Any proposal to saddle India with financial liabilities for Aden on its transfer to the Colonial Office must be strenuously resisted. The Secretary of State for the Colonies, to whom this telegram was repeated, immediately informed the Secretary of State for India that there could of course be no question of the Colonial Office accepting the transfer of Aden unless a substantial contribution were made by India for the maintenance of Indian interests and responsibilities in Arabia (Appendix 24). It must be understood, therefore, that the recommenda-tions made by the Conference, other than those relating to the immediate reductions proposed for the garrison of Aden, are subject to a satisfactory agreement being reached on the question of financial adjustments between the Imperial Government and the Government of India.2. A Committee under the chairmanship of Major-General Sir Percy Radcliffe (Appendix 25) recommended that the present detachment at Nobat Dakim should be withdrawn in order to permit the infantry of the Aden garrison to be reduced at once to three battalions. A condition to this recommendation was that a flight of aeroplanes should be sent to Aden as early as possible, two machines to be available for use on either side of the Gulf of Aden as might be required. They also recommended that the orders already issued for the despatch of a pack battery to Aden should be cancelled; that the squadron of Indian cavalry should be returned at once to India; that two out of the four 6-inch guns, which form the main armament of the Royal Garrison Artillery at Aden, should be laid up; and that the defence light section should be reduced to the minimum required for keeping the instruments in a serviceable condition.3. In order to ensure a further reduction in the garrison it was necessary that satisfactory relations should be established with the Imam of the Yemen (Appendix&apos; 26). The following steps were recommended for the attainment of this object: the removal of the ex-Turkish Yali, through the good offices of the Emir Abdullah; the transmission of a friendly reply to the Imam&apos;s latest letter, which had been received at Aden at the end of February; and the despatch of a member of the Lahej family, with some intelligent ex-Turkish subject, to Sanaa with a view to preparing the way for negotiations. On the success of this mission would depend the prospect of more formal negotiations, resulting in aF6117] C
Treaty of Alliance. The Committee were of opinion that if these negotiations were successful it would be possible to reduce the garrison of Aden to one British and one Indian battalion. The battalion of Yemen infantry should at the same time be reduced to a strength of 400 and transferred to Somaliland to take the place of the Somalis of the Camel Corps, who would be organised on a retaining fee reserve basis. Arrangements would also be made to station one company of the Aden garrison at a hill station in Somaliland, provided that a station ship of about 1,500 tons, capable of carrying 600 troops, was always available at Aden. It was pointed out that the Chief of the Air Staff was averse from permanently detaching so small a unit as a flight of aeroplanes for service in Aden and Somaliland, and that he would prefer the force to be increased to one squadron. Financial considerations would render this impossible. unless the Aden garrison were still further reduced, and it was considered premature to propose any scheme with this object.4. The complete amalgamation of the Aden and Somaliland Administrations was recommended (Appendix 27). No conclusion was arrived at as to whether the Governor should be a military commander of Major-General&apos;s rank, as hitherto at Aden, or a purely civil officer. In the event of its being decided to separate the civil and military functions and to appoint a Civil Governor, the Committee considered that the Officer Commanding troops should not be of higher rank than Colonel-Commandant. It was agreed that a separate administrator resident in Somaliland would be unnecessary under present conditions, and that in the absence of the Governor the Officer Commanding troops at Aden should administer the Government. The political and civil secretaries, the political officers in charge of districts in Somaliland and the officers in executive charge of the towns of Aden and Shaikh Othman would be members of the political service recommended by the Masterton Smith Committee.5. The Governor of Bombay kindly agreed to send a financial representative to discuss the financial aspect of the transfer of Aden, but owing to the shortness of the notice given this officer was unable to reach Cairo in time for the Conference, though he had an opportunity of subsequent discussion there with Sir George Barstow. In the absence of precise information as to Aden expenditure the Conference were unable to make any financial proposals.V.-GENERAL.1. Middle East Services. The Secretary of State approved the recommenda-tions of a Committee which discussed the question of the civil services for the countries dealt with by the Middle East Department (Appendix 28). These recommendations provided for a distinction to be drawn between officers to be absorbed into the pensionable Colonial Service and those who should be offered a five years&apos; engagement on suitable terms. The latter category was practically identical with the political service recommended by the Masterton Smith Committee. It was decided that the respective High Commissioners should submit names of individuals whdse retention was desired, with details of services, if any, to which they belonged, and recommendations specifying under which of the two categories they should fall. The Committee recommended that individuals transferred from pensionable services under other Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government, or under other Governments, should be enabled to carry with them the pension rights which they had already earned, and that special provision should be made for the grant of a higher rate of pension to senior officers who were not already in the possession of previous pension rights. They considered that in the event of the termination of the mandates which had been vested in His Majesty&apos;s Government steps should be taken to safeguard the rights of British officials employed in Palestine and Mesopotamia and that a clause to this effect might be inserted in the mandates. The Colonial Office would work out a scheme as soon as possible which would be communicated, through the respective High Commissioners, to the individuals concerned for comment. Meanwhile individuals should be informed that their status would remain unchanged for a period of three months.2. Subsidies. The Conference framed a comprehensive policy for subsidies to the independent rulers of Arabia (Appendix 29). This provided that the subsidy to Ibn Saud should be increased to 100,000 . a year, paid monthly  in  arrears,   conditional  upon   his  maintaining  peace  with
Mesopotamia, Koweit and the Hedjaz. They recognised that King Hussein and Ibn Saud must be treated on the same footing, and accordingly recommended that the former should be paid a similar subsidy, con-ditional upon improvements in the pilgrimage arrangements, recognition of peace treaties, and the exercise of his influential help in maintaining order and good government in Arabian areas. In the event of satisfactory relations being established with the Imam they considered that that ruler should be offered a subsidy of 2,O00L a month. In order to control the aggression of the Idrisi against the Hedjaz and the Yemen, and thus to enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to increase their influence over King Hussein and the Imam, it was proposed to offer the Idrisi a subsidy of 1,0001. a month on condition that he preserved the peace and excluded foreigners from Asir. They also recommended a payment of 240,000 rupees a year from Mesopotamian revenues to Fahad Bey of the Anezeh and the continuance of the remission of date tax at present accorded by the Mesopotamian Government to the Sheikh of Koweit. They considered that no further payments should be made in respect of the lease of the Koweit foreshore, the appointment of a new Sheikh of Koweit being a suitable occasion for its discontinuance. *3. Cross Desert Route, Railway and Pipe Line. The Secretary of State impressed upon the Conference the necessity for carrying out a far-sighted policy of Imperial aerial development in the future. One of the main air routes of the Empire would undoubtedly be that connecting Egypt with Mesopotamia and India, which would shorten the distance to Australia and New Zealand by eight or ten days. He directed that a committee should examine the possibilities of opening up a motor route across the desert from Palestine to Iraq (Appendix 30). This committee, over which Air Vice-Marshal Sir Geoffrey Salmond presided, recommended that the route should run via Amman, Azraq and Ramadi. This line was preferable to the southern alternative running through Maan, Jauf and Baghdad, because the distance involved was shorter, the tribal conditions were, simpler, and the line was in close proximity to the projected railway line from the Mediterranean to Mesopotamia. Arrangements were made for a preliminary reconnaissance to be made at a cost not exceeding 10,000Z., and the Emir Abdullah undertook, at Jerusalem, to co-operate in every way.Sir Arnold Wilson was consulted by Sir Herbert Samuel about the proposed railway and pipe line. He anticipated that it would not be known for three years whether the prospect of oil in Mesopotamia would justify the construction of such a line, and that two years more would be required for its completion. It was arranged that a railway representative should accompany the desert route reconnaissance party, on receipt of whose report an estimate of the probable cost would be prepared, and definite proposals would be submitted for the whole project, including the port at Haifa.4. Mandates and Anglo-French Convention. Opportunity was taken of the presence of the High Commissioners for Palestine and Mesopotamia to discuss the draft mandates and the Anglo-French Convention (Appendix 31). Beyond the clause suggested by the Committee on the Middle Eastern Civil Services (see paragraph (1) above) the only modifications which suggested themselves were possible additions to the Palestine and Mesopotamian mandates respectively to deal with the administrative distinctions recommended by the Conference for the treatment of Trans-Jordania and Kurdistan. It was realised that it would&apos;be difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Government to suggest any addition to the mandates at so late a stage, but it was thought that in order to anticipate possible legal objections it would be advisable for legal advice to be taken on this point. As a result of a reference to the Colonial Office, additional clauses to the two mandates were drafted in London and the Secretary of State decided that, if it proved un-avoidable that some such addition should be made, these clauses should be adopted.With regard to the Anglo-French Convention, the question of the appointment of the boundary commissioner provided for in article 2 was discussed. It was decided that, as the Mesopotamian section of the boundary could not be delimited until after the hot weather, it was desirable that the delimitation should be begun from the Palestine end, and the Foreign Office were informed accordingly. They were also requested to represent to the French Government that the selection of a French Commissioner who was already on good terms with the British authorities would best serve the ends of both Governments, and the names of two French officers were submitted to them, with the request that they would approach the French Government for the nomination of one or other of them.[6117] C 2
5. Hedjaz Railway. The question of the Hedjaz Railway was raised at Cairo by Sir Herbert Samuel, who pointed out that some authority was required to organise the traffic on the railway, and suggested that this authority might take the form of a joint Board. The question was discussed by a committee at Jerusalem (Appendix 32), which recommended that the Hedjaz Railway, being constituted as a single wakf, and comprising the lines from Damascus to Medina and from Haifa to Deraa, should be treated as a single administration. They considered that, in so far as the territories subject to a British and French mandate were concerned, the general supervision of the line should be entrusted to Moslem representatives from these territories. There should be a Board of Control composed of these representatives, which would meet at Deraa -once a quarter. The management of the line should be vested in three managers, one appointed by each of the three Governments concerned, to whom an appeal would, lie in the event of difference of opinion. These managers would be responsible to the Board of Control in respect of the disposal and distribution of the properties of the railway, but in respect of management, running of trains, &amp;e., each should be responsible to his own Government. All rolling-stock belonging to the railway should be returned to it without delay. they recommend that the finances of the line should be treated as a whole, the allocation of revenues and expenditure being decided by the Board of Control subject to the approval of the Government concerned, and in accordance with the conditions of the wakf. There should be one auditor for the whole line, nominated by the Board of Control, and approved by the three Governments. The Secretary of State decided to take the matter up with the Foreign Office on these lines on his return.VI-CONCLUSION.On the 30th March the Secretary of State left Jerusalem and returned to England, having for nineteen days been engaged in examining and discussing the Middle Eastern problem in all its bearings with the officials concerned. Both at Cairo and Jerusalem the official meetings were supplemented by private and informal discussions which were of at least equal value. Not only did the Conference work out the measures necessary to ensure * an immediate and substantial reduction in Imperial expenditure, but opportunity was taken to frame a common policy for the future. Questions which would normally have involved protracted correspondence between Departments in London, and continual references to the respective authorities on the spot were settled in a few hours&apos; friendly discussion. The experiment was amply justified by its results, and when improved communications bring the various countries of Middle East into closer contact, it may perhaps be repeated with even greater advantage.

\If)SECTION I-MIDDLE EAST: EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE CONFERENCE AND PROCEDURE ADOPTED.Appendix I.REPORT OF THE INTERDEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE APPOINTED BY THE PRIME MINISTER TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO THE FORMATION OF A NEW DEPARTMENT UNDER THE COLONIAL OFFICE TO DEAL WITH MANDATED AND OTHER TERRITORIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST.TERMS OF REFERENCE.The Prime Minister desires that an Interdepartmental Committee, under the supervision of the Secretary of State for War, composed as follows : Sir James Mastekton Smith, K.C.B. (in the Chair), Sir Herbert Creedy, K.C.B., C.V.O., War Office, Sir Herbert Read, K.C.M.G., C.B., Colonial Office, Mr. Russell Scott, C.B., C.S.I., Treasury, Mr. J. E. Shuckburgh, C.B., India Office, .   Major H. W. Young, D.S.O., Foreign Office,with Mr. E. E. Bridges, Treasury (Secretary),shall meet To make recommendations for implementing the Cabinet decisions of the 31st December in regard to the formation of a new Department, under the Colonial Office, to deal with the administration of British mandated territories in the Middle East; this Department to comprise in principle Mesopotamia, Aden and Palestine.The Committee to recommend in outline the steps to be taken to form a Middle Eastern Service for the administration of such territories, and the discharge of British responsibilities in regard to them; to prepare a time table for the handing over to the Colonial Office of the said duties from the different Departments now concerned with them; and to advise on the question of accommodation, &amp;c.; to report to the Secretary of State for War by the 1st February for reference to the Prime Minister.January 11, 1921.
ToThe Right Hon. W. S. Churchill, M.P. Sir, ,1. We were appointed by Cabinet Minute of the 11th January, 1921, to make recommendations for carrying out the Cabinet decisions of the 31st December, 1920, in regard to the formation of a new Department under the Colonial Office to deal with the administration of British mandated territories in the Middle East. We were instructed to report to you by the 1st February for reference to the Prime Minister.I-DEFINITION OF THE TERRITORIAL SPHERE OF THE new department.2. In our terms of reference, which are set out in full on the opposite page, it is laid down that the Department to be set up is to &quot; comprise in principle Mesopotamia, Aden and Palestine.&quot; We assume that it was intended that the term Palestine should cover Trans-Jordania. We are, however, faced at the outset with the following difficulty : Mesopotamia, Aden and Palestine are not conterminous. The large inter-vening area is sparsely inhabited by Arab tribes, who depend in the main on One or other of these three territories for their contact with the outside world. The land boundary of the kden Protectorate is fixed on the West and North, but remains undefined on the East, and the land boundaries of Mesopotamia and Palestine on the south-west and east, respectively, have not yet been determined. Owing to the fact that the nomad tribes in the adjoining territories move freely to and fro between the desert and the more settled areas, it is questionable whether these boundaries can ever be defined in a final and satisfactory manner.3. We understand that Article 132 of the Treaty of Sevres provides that the disposal of this Central Arabian area, with the exception of the Hedjaz, is to be made by the Principal Allied Powers ; that it has been the intention of the Foreign Office to obtain recognition from the other Principal Allied Powers of the special political interests of Great Britain in these areas ; but that it has not yet been found possible to approach them with this end in view.Although the Kingdom of the Hedjaz has been recognized as an independent State, none of its land boundaries have as yet been fixed.We also understand that it was the intention of the Foreign Office to submit that the delimitation of the boundaries of Mesopotamia and Palestine should be undertaken by Great Britain as the mandatory for these two areas, in conj unction with the Arab rulers concerned.4. In considering the steps to be taken to form a new Department to deal with the administration of Mesopotamia, Aden and Palestine, we have found it essential to take into account the future of the intervening area, and the special difficulties arising out. of the absence of clearly defined boundaries. We have assumed that it was the^ underlying intention of the Cabinet decisions of the 31st December last that all administrative and political responsibilities which will devolve upon His Majesty&apos;s Government in respect of the Arab areas of the Middle East should, as far as possible, be placed under the control of one Department. The wording of our terms of reference quoted above has encouraged us in this belief.5. On the assumption that it is the intention of the Cabinet that the Middle Eastern, or rather the Arab, problem should be treated as one organic whole, we consider that the guiding principle should be that the new Department should be responsible for directing policy as regards the whole Arabian peninsula, subject to certain qualifications, which are discussed later, regarding the Kingdom of the Hedjaz.6. We accordingly recommend, subject to certain reservations to which we refer later, that the sphere of the new Department should include all the territories south and east of the newly defined boundary between the French mandated territories of Syria and the British mandated territories of Palestine and Mesopotamia. On the west this sphere would be bounded by the Mediterranean; on the south-west by the frontier of Egypt and the Red Sea; on the south and south-east by the Indian Ocean; on the north-east by the north-eastern boundary of Mesopotamia and by the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf.(9309)     [6117] d
7. This will entail the assumption by the new Department of all responsibility for the obligations resulting from the treaties which His Majesty&apos;a Government have from time to time negotiated with the Chiefs of the various districts of Arabia, and the responsibility for the negotiation of further treaties of this description. It will also entail the new Department having an influential if not a determining voice in the delimitation of the boundaries which have not yet been fixed, though the negotiations with the Principal Allied Powers would of course be conducted through the ordinary diplomatic channels.8. With regard to the north-eastern boundary of the area, for which we recommend that the new Department should be responsible, we offer the following observations : (1.) Kurdistan. We understand that Article 64 of the Treaty of Sevres provides that, if within a period of one year from the coming into force of the Treaty the majority of the Kurdish peoples inhabiting the areas between the Armenian and Mesopotamian frontiers shall demand to be independent, and if the Council of the League considers them capable of such independence, Turkey will renounce all rights and title over these areas. In this case no objection will be raised by the Principal Allied Powers to the voluntary adhesion to such an independent Kurdish State of the Kurds inhabiting that part of Kurdistan (generally known as Southern Kurdistan) which has hitherto been included in the Mosul Vilayet.We recommend that pending such a development the responsibility for Kurdistan should be vested in the new Department.9. (2.) Persian Gulf littoral.-These areas have for the last hundred years or more been under the political control of the Government of India, exercised for the past fifty years through an officer of the Government of India, with headquarters at Bushire with the title of Political &quot;Resident in the Persian Gulf who also controls the Northern (Persian) littoral as well as certain inland Consulates in South Persia. The Gulf is thus dealt with as a single administrative unit for all purposes. Posts at Bushire and .on either side of the Gulf are interchangeable. The officers at each political agency (including an Arab residency agent at Sharjah, on the Trucial coast) correspond with the Government of India through the Political Resident at Bushire. This post is always held by an officer of many years&apos; experience of the Gulf, assisted by an adequate staff.10. All the accounts of the stations in the Gulf are dealt with at Bushire, where there is a Treasury of the Government of India. The currency of the Persian Gulf is almost exclusively Indian and the amounts involved are very large (e.g., the Bahrein pearl trade alone aggregates over 4,000,000/. annually).Almost all trade is with India; the Gulf lives almost wholly on cereals imported from India.   Indian merchants handle the bulk of the trade.11. Quarantine, Postal and Telegraphic Services, Public Works, Lights and Buoys, Naval duties, Military detachments and Political and Administrative personnel through-out the Persian Gulf are provided, controlled and partly paid for by India. The transfer to the new Department of the Arabian littoral would entail an additional burden on His Majesty&apos;s Treasury and could scarcely be accomplished without much confusion and possible friction. At the same time, we realize that the fact of Ibn Saud&apos;s territory having an outlet on the Gulf renders it essential that the new Department should have a deciding voice in all questions of policy affecting the littoral.12. We accordingly recommend that the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf should remain under the control of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; that this officer should be appointed as at present by the Government of India, but should be authorized to communicate direct with the Colonial Office on matters concerning the Arabian littoral ; that, the functions of the Government of India in respect of the Arabian littoral should be confined to administrative and purely local matters, and that the prior concurrence of the Colonial Office should be obtained by them to any measures of political significance ; and lastly, that the relations of His Majesty&apos;s Government with Ibn Saud should be conducted, exclusively by the new Department through the Political Resident at Bushire in the first place. It may also be desirable to provide that the Political Agent at Bahrein, whom we understand to be the official in direct touch with Ibn Saud, should in cases of urgency be communicated with direct by the new Department.
II. SCOPE OF THE NEW DEPARTMENT.16. We have thought it necessary to discuss at some length the definition of the territorial sphere for which the new Department should be responsible, since it was clearly impossible for us to make effective recommendations while it remained uncertain what areas were under consideration. For the same reason we think it necessary to have some working definition of the scope of the new Department before proceeding to discuss in detail the steps to be taken with regard to its formation. If our interpretation of the intentions of the Cabinet in regard to the territorial sphere of the new Department is accepted, the Colonial Office will become the responsible British authority on all . matters relating to : (a.) Administration and policy in Mesopotamia, Palestine and Aden.(b.) Policy in other Arab areas within the British sphere of influence.(c.) The delimitation of boundaries between British spheres and the territories of independent Arab rulers. (d.) All expenditure, whether civil or military, which may fall upon Imperial fundsas a result of British responsibility for and interest in the areas concerned.17. Some of the problems arising out of this definition have been dealt with in the recommendations which we have already made.   As regards (d), we have not considered the question of financial adjustments with the Government of India.   Nor . have we examined the larger question of the incidence of expenditure in respect of the Mandated territories.There remain three questions of major importance : (1.) The arrangements to be made for carrying out British military policy in the Middle East, and the relations between the Colonial Office, and the War Office and Air Ministry.[6117]13. Relations with the Kingdom of the Hedjaz. If these arrangements are carried out, the Colonial Office will become the authority responsible for the direction of the Arabian policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, except in regard to the Kingdom of the Hedjaz. On geographical grounds, there would be obvious advantages in an arrangement by which negotiations with the Kingdom of the Hedjaz were entrusted to the Department which is to be responsible for the territories surrounding it on three sides. * It is also clear that the new Department will be seriously hampered in its dealings with Central Arabia if it is not in a position to exercise a direct influence over the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to the Kingdom of the Hedjaz.14. It may appear somewhat anomalous that negotiations with an independent Kingdom should be entrusted to any Department other than the Foreign Office. It has been suggested that the direct conduct of negotiations between the Government of India and Afghanistan presents a somewhat similar arrangement to that indicated above, but we understand it to be the view of the Foreign Office, that the case of Afghanistan does not offer an exact analogy with that of the Hedjaz.Afghanistan is not in general diplomatic relations with Western Powers ; it is not a member of the League of Nations; it has practically no means of access to the outside world, and geographical reasons alone would be sufficient to make the Viceroy of India the channel of communication between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Afghan Government. The Hedjaz, on the other hand, has only to ratify the Treaty of Versailles to regularize its position as an original member of the&apos;League of Nations&apos;; it contains the holiest cities of Islam, to which large numbers of the Moslem subjects of&quot; every power in the world make an annual pilgrimage,; it lies on the Red Sea, and thus has access by water to the outside world, and European Powers will continue to be represented there in the future, as they have been in the past. We cannot deny that there is considerable force in this argument. At the same time, we are impressed with the paramount importance of the general direction and control of the Arabian policy of. His Majesty&apos;s Government being vested in one Department of State, though we regard any arrangement by which the representative of His Majesty s Government in the Hedjaz should communicate with any Department other than the. Foreign Office as unworkable.15. We accordingly recommend that the channel of communication between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Hedjaz Government should still be the Foreign Office, but that in all questions affecting purely Arab politics the Colonial Office should be regarded as the responsible British authority.
(2.) The civilian Services which will be required for the Administration of Palestine, Mesopotamia, and Aden, and for political duties in other parts of Arabia. -(3.) The constitution of the new Department of the Colonial Office. We propose to deal with each of these questions separately.III.-MILITAEY ARRANGEMENTS.   RELATIONS BETWEEN THE COLONIAL OFFICE, AND  THE  WAR OFFICE AND AIR MINISTRY.18. The Cabinet decisions of the 31st December last contemplate that a fundamental change shall be made in the present position whereby the War Office and Air Ministry bear the cost of military operations in Mesopotamia and have to answer for such expenditure in Parliament, while the policy is in the main laid down by other Departments. We have, therefore, to consider what should be the relationship between these two Service Departments and the Colonial Office in regard to military operations in Mesopotamia.19. This question will of necessity be affected by the decision taken as to the force which is to be maintained in, Mesopotamia. We understand that a Committee has been considering this question under the chairmanship of the Adjutant-General to the Forces, and that the general policy aimed at is to replace the hulk of the regular garrison by an effective force -of armed Constabulary and certain specially raised Indian (or possibly African) units officered from the British and/or Indian Armies. We understand that it is contemplated that the Colonial Office should recruit this latter force through an officer holding a post of Inspector-General under the Colonial Office, and that the arrangements should in the main be similar to those already existing as regards the recruitment and maintenance of the King&apos;s African Rifles and West African Frontier Force. The Colonial Office would arrange direct with the War Office for the loan of officers and personnel to form the necessary cadre and would assume direct and full financial responsibility. We will return later to these proposals. The more immediate and important question is to decide upon the arrangements to be made to tide over the transition period before this eventual normal establishment is reached.20. We have assumed that for some time it will probably be necessary to maintain in Mesopotamia a considerably larger force than this eventual establishment. It is therefore necessary to devise means for putting an end at once to the present unsatisfactory system of divided responsibility.21. A possible solution would be for the Colonial Office to set up a complete military organization, which should be in a position to offer military advice as to the forces necessary to carry out the policy decided upon by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and should be responsible for all the military and financial arrangements necessary to maintain troops in Mesopotamia. This suggestion does not in any way commend itself to us. It would be uneconomical to the highest degree and would involve duplisation of work. Further, it is most undesirable to set up a large depart-ment to perform a task which it is hoped will be in the nature of a decreasing liability.22. We recommend during the transitional period that the War Office and the Air Ministry should continue to be the Departments responsible for advising as to the forces required to carry out the general,military policy decided upon.We trust that the Secretary of State for the Colonies may, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State for War and the Secretary of State for Air, have the advice of the departments of the War Office and Air Ministry concerned, on all questions affecting their respective forces.23. Further, we recommend that the War Office and Air Ministry should act as agents for the Colonial Office in maintaining such regular forces, and in conducting such military and air operations as may be required in Mesopotamia during the transitional period.
This question requires further explanation both on its financial side and in its military aspect.24. Financial relations.-In its financial aspect, the War Office and Air Ministry would be responsible for including in their estimates of the cost of the Army and Eoyal Air Force, as a whole, the expenditure to be incurred in Mesopotamia, and would show a recovery of that sum to be made as an Appropriation in Aid to Army and Air Estimates. The Colonial Office would at a later stage present to Parliament estimates which would include an amount to be repaid to the War Office and Air Ministry in respect of this expenditure, and would charge their accounts with the amounts certified by the War Office and Air Ministry to have been expended. As far as finance is con-cerned, the Colonial Office would have to repay to the War Office and Air Ministry within the financial year, but if accounts were not immediately available, we should recommend the payment of advances within the year up to amounts estimated by the War Office and Air Ministry to be required : certificates of actual expenditure would be required from the War Office and Air Ministry, but the total which they were able to certify before the accounts for a given year closed, to have been expended up to the 31st March preceding, would be finally charged in Colonial Office accounts for that year.Similar arrangements should be made in regard to the military and air expenditure of the War Office and. Air Ministry, respectively, in Palestine.25. For the purposes of securing adequate control, India Office military expenditure in respect of Indian Army troops serving in Mesopotamia should be charged in the first instance to the War Office. The latter would, therefore, in elude in their original estimates of cost to be incurred, and also as, part of the recovery from Colonial Office, such Indian Army expenditure.26. We consider that the Chief Financial Advisers to the High Commissioners in Mesopotamia and Palestine should be responsible for advising their respective. High - Commissioners in regard to expenditure generally.27. We recommend  that the   financial   arrangements   outlined  in the preceding paragraphs should take effect as from the 1st April, 1921.28. Relations between Civil and Military Authorities. We recommend that the High Commissioner in Mesopotamia should, as is customary elsewhere, have the titular rank of Commander-in-Chief, it being understood that the possession of this title will not confer on him any right to give executive commands to the troops. We recommend that the General Officer Commanding in Mesopotamia should be appointed by the War Office and Colonial Office in conjunction.29. On matters of principle or policy in their military aspects, the General Officer Commanding in Mesopotamia should only communicate with the War Office through the High Commissioner, but he should have the right to communicate direct with the War Office on questions of intelligence, training and preparation for war, as well as on matters affecting the routine administration of the Army.We understand that this is the arrangement.suggested to regulate the relations of the Commander-in-Chief in India with the authorities at home.It would also be well to ensure that the High Commissioner, and the General Officer Commanding in Mesopotamia on the one hand and the Colonial Office and the War Office on the other should exchange regularly telegrams of mutual interest.We think that these arrangements, which give effect to the principle of the ultimate responsibility of the military to the civil authority, will regulate satisfactorily the relations of the departments concerned, and that they should be adopted from the date on which the Colonial Office takes over the control of Mesopotamia.30. There is however, one respect in which we would delay the application of this arrangement.   We do not think it right that the Colonial Office should be called upon to assume any responsibility in regard to the military operations connected with the . withdrawal of the British forces in North-West Persia.31. We therefore recommend that the financial and military responsibility for the withdrawal of British Forces from North-West Persia should remain with the War Office nntil this Force has been withdrawn within the boundaries oj Mesopotamia, and become subject to the ultimate control of the High Com-missioner.
32. There would thus he three stages in the process by which the War Office will divest itself of responsibility for military policy in the Middle East.(1.) The withdrawal stage during which the War Office is to retain full responsibility for the operations in Persia, until the withdrawal is complete.(2.) The transitional period during which time the War Office and Air Ministry will act as agents for the Colonial Office in the manner indicated above.(3.) The stage when the normal establishment has been reached. This establishment is &apos;to consist mainly of personnel under the direct control of the Colonial Office. The special forces of white constabulary and Indian (or possibly African) units would be administered and controlled by the Colonial Office. Any regular Units required in addition in the early stages would be lent by the War Office and Air Ministry as during the transitional period.33. A similar arrangement as to the relations between the civil and military authorities is already in force in Palestine. There is, however, this difference, that the troops stationed in Egypt and Palestine are for certain purposes regarded as one force, under the Command of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Egyptian Expeditionary Force, who, of course, can transfer troops from Egypt to Palestine or vice versa, but delegates such powers as he thinks suitable to the General Officers Commanding in Egypt and Palestine. The High Commissioner for Palestine is. titular Commander-in-Chief, and is responsible for the general policy adopted in Palestine, subject to the special limitation imposed by these circumstances. ,IV.-CIVILIAN SERVICES.34. We are asked to &quot; recommend in outline the steps to be taken to form a Middle Eastern Service for the administration of British mandated territories in the Middle East; and for the discharge of British responsibilities in regard to them.&quot;35. Administration of Palestine. Arrangements for the formation of a Palestinian service are already far advanced. We understand that staff has been recruited by the High Commissioner on the basis of a provisional establishment, and that negotiations are now proceeding between the Foreign Office and Treasury as to the permanent grading to be adopted for the officials of the Palestine administration. It has been agreed in principle that posts in this service are to be pensionable, but the details of the pension scheme have not yet been settled. In the circumstances, we do not consider it necessary to make detailed recommendations. The final settlement of negotiations with the Treasury as to the details of the scheme would be handed over to the Colonial Office by the Foreign Office. ,36. We are of the opinion that having regard to the fact that His Majesty&apos;s Government, as the Mandatory for Palestine, have undertaken to give effect to the proclaimed policy of establishing a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine, and to the special international importance of the country, it would not in any case prove feasible to combine into one service the administration of Palestine and of the other areas within the sphere of the new Department.37. We therefore recommend that the Palestinian Service should remain distinct from whatever service it may be necessary to set up to fulfil British, responsibilities in other areas of the Middle East..38. In dealing with the civilian staff required for the other areas, we find it necessary to distinguish two main categories: first, the technical services which are necessary to carry on Government services in the settled districts,. e.g., irrigation and postal services, railways, customs, &amp;c.; secondly, the officers who will be required to act as advisers to the Arab authorities. It will be convenient to deal first with the technical services.39.-Technical services.-(1.) Persian Gulf littoral.-In paragraph 12 we have already recommended that for administrative and purely local purposes the control of the Government of India over the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf should be maintained.
It follows from this recommendation that the administrative and technical personnel at Koweit, Bahrein, &amp;c, should remain under the control of the Government of India, which would continue to be responsible for questions of recruitment, &amp;c.: 40. (2.) Aden. The existing civil administration of Aden is carried on by members of the Bombay Political Department, &amp;c, numbering in all about twenty-five officers: 41. Wc recommend that this administrative service should&apos;be taken over and organized by the Colonial Office on the lines of, and possibly as part of, similar services under that department.42. (3.) Mesopotamia. &quot;We understand that the technical services in Mesopo-tamia will, in the main, be organized as part of the Arab Government, and that officers in these services will not be in the employment of His Majesty&apos;s Government. We have not therefore made any recommendation as to these services.43. (4.) Trans-Jordania. We would suggest that it might at some later date be found convenient for the technical services in Trans-Jordania to be administered as part of the technical services of Palestine.44. Advisers and Political Officers.   Mesopotamia.   The political administration of Mesopotamia is at present being carried out by officers who have been recruited in a number of ways. Some officers have been loaned by other Governments who are now pressing for their return. A considerable number of Army officers have been seconded for definite periods. There are also a great many temporary officers who served in the East during the war and who are now engaged on a temporary basis with contracts varying for the most part from one to three years.We understand that the High Commissioner estimates that 40 officers will be required in the immediate future for political duties, but that the number may be capable of subsequent reduction to 30.45. We have considered whether it would be desirable to fix a definite cadre and to establish a Mesopotamian service on the lines of the Palestinian service. We think that such a step would hardly be consistent with our obligations as Mandatory for Mesopotamia, and that the proper course is for the civil administration of Mesopotamia to remain on a provisional footing. Further, the number qf British officials required in Mesopotamia is at the present moment decreasing, and it seems likely that for some time to come sufficient personnel of the right quality will be available on the spot.46. We do not therefore recommend setting up a Mesopotamian service or creating a pensionable establishment, unless it becomes clear that the necessary personnel is not obtainable on the special conditions recommended in paragraph 47. Nor do we think it necessary to suggest any special method of recruitment.47. It will, however, be necessary to give some security of tenure to officers not loaned from parent services. We approve in principle the suggestion made by the High Commissioner for Mesopotamia, that a certain proportion of such officers should be given 5 years&apos; engagements. Instead of a pension scheme we&apos; suggest that it would be desirable to arrange a system of gratuities payable in respect of each completed years service, such gratuity being payable both to officers who are given 5 years&apos; engagements and to the margin of officers whom it will be necessary to employ over and above those who are engaged for the longer period. The details of this scheme should be worked out between the Colonial Office and Treasury.48. As regards officers loaned from parent services, special steps are essential to secure- the loan of an adequate number of experienced officials for as long as may be necessary to fill a proportion of the more responsible posts. The exact conditions of engagement will have to be settled in each individual case, but we recommend that arrangements should be made in all cases to secure that service under the Mesopotamian administration will count for pension. -49. In addition to the Political Officers required for service in Mesopotamia, a certain number of officers will be needed to perform similar duties in other areas. We understand that there are at present five officers engaged on such duties in Trans-Jordania but that it may be necessary to increase the number. A certain number of officers will also be required for duty in the Aden Protectorate and on the Persian Gulf Littoral.    ;
We are of the opinion that the officers who will he needed for political duties in these areas will have to possess the same general qualifications as the Advisers and Political Officers in Mesopotamia.50. We therefore recommend that there should be one body of &quot;Arab Political Officers &quot; who should be liable for service in any part of the territorial sphere of the new Department outside Palestine. We recommend that the arrangements which are proposed in paragraphs 47 and 48 should apply to this, body of officers as a whole.V.-FORMATION OF THE NEW DEPARTMENT UNDER THE COLONIALOFFICE.51. The last question which we have to deal with is &quot; the formation of the new Department under the Colonial Office &quot; . . . . and the preparation of a time-table for the handing over to the Colonial Office of these new duties.52. From the definitions of the scope of the new Department which we gave in paragraph 16 it is clear that the new Department must contain sections or branches capable of dealing with questions of policy, administration and finance. The existing organization of the Colonial Office does not provide the expert advice which the new Department will require. Political and administrative questions affecting the Arab areas demand a knowledge of local customs and language. To effect the desired reduction in the expenditure which has hitherto been incurred in connection with the Arab countries, a very close scrutiny and control of local expenditure will be necessary. The formation of the special forces, referred to in paragraph 19, which will be required if Imperial funds are to be relieved of the heavy cost of maintaining regular units of the British or Indian armies in Mesopotamia and Palestine will demand expert military advice.53. We assume that the Secretary of State will exercise his control through an Under Secretary, and an Assistant Under Secretary. We do not think that it is for us to consider whether either or both of these officials will require to be specially appointed for the purposes of the new Department, or whether the duties involved in the new responsibilities of the Colonial Office will be discharged by one or other of the existing Under Secretaries and Assistant Under Secretaries. The point at which the political and administrative, military, and financial branches should separate is, in our opinion, immediately below the Assistant Under Secretary. There would be three sub- divisions, organized as follows : (1.) Political and Administrative Palestine. Mesopotamia. Aden and Arabia.(2.) Military-Relations with the War Office and Air Ministry on questions arising out of&quot;the employment of regular British or Indian units. Organization of local troops and consequent provision of British personnel.(3.) Financial.54. In addition to the above general outline technical advice may be required upon such subjects as Muhammadan Law, Commerce, Public Works, &amp;c.It will probably be found possible for this technical advice to be provided in the main by existing branches of the Colonial Office.55. We recommend that in forming the political and administrative sub-division of the new Department full use should be made of the services of officers with local experience, and that there should be free interchange between officers serving at home and abroad.56. In Appendix A we present a diagram showing in outline our conception of&quot; the provisional organization xequired to discharge the functions that we have assigned
VI.-SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS.60. Territorial sphere of the New Department (paragraphs 2--15).Subject to certain reservations the sphere of the new Department to include all the territories south and east of the newly defined boundary between the French mandated territories of Syria and the British mandated territories of Palestine and Mesopotamia (paragraph 6).Reservations are made as regards Kurdistan (paragraph 8), the Persian Gulf littoral (paragraphs 9-12) and the Hedjaz (paragraphs 13-15).61. Scope of the New Department (paragraphs 16-17). The Colonial Office to become the responsible British authority on all matters relating to : (a.) Administration and policy in Mesopotamia, Palestine and Aden.(6.) Policy in other Arab areas within the British sphere of influence.(c.) The delimitation of boundaries between British spheres and the territories of independent Arab rulers. (d.) All expenditure, whether civil or military, which may fall upon Imperial fundsas a result of British responsibility for and interest in the areas concerned.62. Military arrangements (paragraphs 18-33).Relations between the Colonial Office and the War Office and Air Ministry (paragraphs 22-23).The financial arrangements proposed to take effect as from the 1st April, 1921 (paragraph 27).The High Commissioner in Mesopotamia to have the titular rank of Commander-in-Chief (paragraph 28).The responsibility for the withdrawal of British forces from North-West Persia to remain with the War Office until this force has been withdrawn within the boundaries of Mesopotamia (paragraph 31).63. Civilian services. The Palestinian service to remain distinct from other civilian services in the Middle East (paragraph 37).The administration of the Persian Gulf littoral to remain under the control of the Government of India (paragraph 39).[6117] , e/tentatively to the new Department. But it is clear that the accuracy of any estimate of numbers must depend upon the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Arabian sphere, and the measure of control that it is proposed to exercise from London over the actions of the authorities on the spot. In any event we recommend that steps be taken immediately to provide accommodation on an adequate scale in order to avoid the dislocation that might otherwise be caused in the early days of the new organization. While it is difficult to make any close estimate of the number of officers required, we recommend that about twelve to fourteen rooms should be made available to accommodate the staff of the new Department. The necessary steps are being taken by the Office of Works in consultation with the Colonial Office.57. Decisions of great consequence will have to be taken in the immediate future by the Government on the recommendation of the Secretary of State for the Colonies and it is, in our opinion, essential that he should have at his disposal an adequate staff directly the new responsibilities are transferred to him, if British expenditure in the Middle East is to be reduced effectively.58. We recommend that in the first instance the new Department should be manned by officers loaned from parent Services and that no additional permanent commitment should be incurred until the future of the new Department can be gauged with greater precision.59. We anticipate that the arrangements for securing the loan of the personnel from their parent services, and for obtaining the accommodation required, should be completed by the 1st March next.We therefore recommend that the transfer of the new responsibilities to the Colonial Office should become effective upon that date.
Aden to be taken over by the Colonial Office (paragraph 41).No separate permanent establishment to be created for the Mesopotamian service (paragraph 46), but one body of &quot; Arab Political Officers,&quot; liable for service in any part of the territorial sphere of the new Department outside Palestine (paragraph 50).64. Formation of the New Department.-The new Department to he manned in the first instance by officers loaned from parent services (paragraph 58).In forming the New Department full use to be made of officers with local experience (paragraph 55).The transfer of the new responsibilities to the Colonial Office to become effective on the 1st March next (paragraph 59).* J.

Appendix 2,MEMORANDUM DRAWN UP IN LONDON BY MIDDLE EAST DEPARTMENT PRIOR TO CAIRO CONFERENCE.Agenda.1. Selection of ruler and his relations with His Majesty&apos;s Government under the Mandate.2. Foreign relations of Mesopotamia under the Mandate.Mesopotamia.WE regard the selection.of an Arab ruler for Mesopotamia as an essential preliminary to the establishment of satisfactory per-manent conditions in that country. This should not await the convening of the Assembly, but should be carried out by the Council of State, subject to confirmation by the Assembly when elected. We consider that Feisal should be the ruler, and that the first step is to ascertain from Sir P. Cox that he can ensure the Council of State selecting him. The High Commissioner may then be instructed to proceed accordingly. As soon as the Council have notified their choice, Feisal should be invited to proceed forthwith to Mesopotamia. (N.B.-Before putting FeisaTs name before the Council of State we should obtain his provisional acceptance of the draft Mandate on the understanding that as soon as the Organic Law has been brought into operation, we shall be prepared to consider any proposals the Mesopotamian Government may wish to make for readjusting their relations with His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment.)The Mandate provides for the control by the mandatory of the foreign relations of Mesopotamia and for defence of Mesopotamia by the mandatory from foreign attack. It follows, therefore, that pending any readjustment of relations such as is contemplated in paragraph 1, His Majesty&apos;s Government must retain control of foreign relations and remain responsible for external defence. A diminution of this responsibility is highly desirable on every ground, but it can only be secured by a corresponding relaxation of control over foreign relations. A division of control over foreign relations may be somewhat of a departure from established political theory, but the mandatory system is itself a new departure in political theory, and has introduced a new set of political problems demanding treatment for which past practice affords no perfect analogy. Mesopotamia is open to attack (1.) From the sea.(2.) From French Syria.  &apos;(3.) From Turkey.(4.) From Persia.(5.) From (a) Mohammerah and (6) the push-i-Kuh, which, though nominally part of Persia, are, in effect, inde-pendent.(6.) From Kurdistan.(7.) From the Arabian Desert.As regards (1) and (2) we must clearly assume, entire responsi-bility for defence. The position with regard to (3) must depend upon the- conclusion of an arrangement between ourselves and the Turkish Nationalists. If such an arrangement is concluded, we must assume responsibility as against Turkey.(4) is more doubtful. But the only practicable line of attack from Persia is along the Hamadan road, and we understand that this road could be defended by a comparatively small body of troops against any probable attacking force. The occupation of this line would have the incidental advantage of furnishing a hill station for British troops, well removed from the political centre of gravity in Mesopotamia.[6117] F
(5.) (a.) The Sheikh of Mohammerah is in an exceptional position. He has been in close and friendly relations with His Majesty&apos;s Government for many years. The interests of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are closely associated with his territory, and depend upon his goodwill and co-operation. The maintenance of direct relations between him and His Majesty&apos;s Government appears essential, and should, in our opinion, be conducted, as before the War, through the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire. We do not recommend that he should be placed in direct relations with the Mesopotamian Government. The risk of his attacking Mesopotamia appears to us to be negligible.(6.) push-i-Kuh stands on a different footing. Both from the diplomatic and the military point of view, an Arab Administration appears to us better qualified that the Mandatory Power to conduct its frontier relations with a ruler, such as the Wali.(6.) Provided Kurdistan is not directly administered from Turkey, we consider that once its political status has been definitely determined, both the conduct of diplomatic relations with that State and the responsibility for defence against Kurdish attack, should rest with the Mesopotamian Government rather than with the Mandatory Power.(7.) With regard to the defence of Mesopotamia from attack from the desert, we consider that the Mesopotamian Government should accept both diplomatic and military responsibility.The effect of the above proposals would be  .(a.) To place the Mesopotamian Government in direct relations with, and to make it responsible for, the protection of Mesopotamia against local attacks from 1. push-i-Kuh ; 2. Kurdistan ;3. Limitrophe Arab tribes ; and(6.) To impose upon His Majesty&apos;s Government the responsibility for diplomatic and military protection of Mesopotamia against 1. Overseas attack.2. French Syria.3. Turkey.4. Persia.5. Mohammerah.3. Future adminis- We assume that the British personnel employed in Mesopotamiatrative arrange- will fall under two categories : merits-(a.) British Politicalofficers. (a.) British Political Officers.These will consist of the High Commissioner and his personal staff, the Advisers to Arab Ministers and the Divisional Advisers and Assistant Divisional Advisers recommended by Sir P. Cox in his telegram No. 392 S of the 17th February. These officers will be under the orders of the High Commissioner and not of the Mesopotamian Government. The Divisional Advisers will normally communicate with him through the Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, though this will not preclude them from direct communica-tion with Advisers to other Ministries as circumstances may demand. All British Political Officers will be engaged and paid in the first instance by His Majesty&apos;s Government, whose servants they will remain. They will be regarded as members of the Political Service contemplated in the Masterton-Smith report, and will be transferable to other areas of the Middle East at the discretion of His Majesty&apos;s Government.
(b.) British em-ployees of Mesopo-mesopotamian Government.(c.) Judiciary.(d.) Finance.(d.) Finance.4. We consider that the permanent garrison of Mesopotamia for the years 1922-23, 1923-24, 1924-25 should be discussed. The forces to be considered would be British, Indian and local; the relation of the auxiliaries to the Imperial troops should be decided. The strengths, composition, distribution and housing of the troops ; possible recruitment of Assyrians; the question of the respective positions of the Army and the Air Force; defence schemes, &amp;c, will presumably be considered.5. The Secretary of State minutes that a Sub-Committee is &quot; To examine present military charges station by station, unit by unit, category by category. To formulate proposals for immediate economy, and report before Conference separates.&quot;44 Also to report on time table of reduction of present force to permanent garrison, as settled by Conference discussion on section 4 of agenda. My hope is that one-third of present troops can leave Mesopotamia before the hot weather, and another third immediately after it is over.&quot;&quot; You should have papers and means to give rough figures of saving to Army Estimates involved in various accelerations of withdrawal.   The shipping question must also be studied.&quot;We consider that as soon as the Conference has taken its preliminary decisions a Military Sub-Committee should be set up to consider sections 4 and 5 of the agenda, and to report their findings to the Conference in time for discussion before it separates.6. Special subjects- 6. YVe are strongly of opinion that purely Kurdish areas should (a.) Kurdistan.        not be included in the Arab State of Mesopotamia, but that theprinciples of Kurdish unity .and nationality should be promoted as far as possible by His Majesty&apos;s Government. The extent of the area within which it will be possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to carry out this policy must necessarily depend upon the final terms of the peace settlement with Turkey. Whatever the extent of this area may be, we consider that not only control by His Majesty&apos;s Government, but also negotiations with the Mesopotamian Govern-ment, as suggested in paragraph 2, would be facilitated if there[6117] F 24. Permanent garrison.5. Immediate mili-tary economies. Time table of reduc-tion of forces to permanent strength.(b.) British Employees of Mesopotamian Government.All British civil personnel other than the advisory staff mentioned in (a) above will eventually be servants of the Mesopotamian Government, engaged and paid by them on terms to be settled by mutual agreement, subject to the concurrence of the High Commissioner. So long as the mandate is in force, His Majesty&apos;s Government must, in our opinion, accept responsibility for the due fulfilment by the Mesopotamian Government of the terms agreed upon. This will entail some provision being made for an ultimate appeal to the High Commissioner. No readjust-ment of relations between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Mesopotamian Government should be contemplated which does not provide for a clause safeguarding the interests of British personnel engaged under this paragraph.(c.) Judiciary.We recommend that Sir Percy Cox be asked to expeditesubmission of his recommendations on Sir E. Bonham-Oarters Memorandum.
(b.) Amnesty for political offenders.(c.) Refugees.((/.) Indian labour.Agenda..1. Distinction to be drawn between Palestine and Trans-Jordan under the Mandate.Palestine.. His Majesty&apos;s Government are responsible under the terms of the Mandate for establishing in Palestine a national home for the Jewish,people. They are also pledged by the assurances given to the Sherif of Mecca in 1915 to recognise and support the iride-pendence of the Arabs in those portions of the (Turkish) vilayet of Damascus in which they are free to act without detriment to French interests. The western boundary of the Turkish vilayet of Damascus before the war was the River Jordan. Palestine and Trans-Jordan do not, therefore, stand upon quite the same footing; At the same time, the two areas are economically interdependent, and their development must be considered as a single problem... Further, His Majesty&apos;s Government have been entrusted with the Mandate for &quot; Palestine.&quot; If they wish to assert their claim to Trans-Jordan and to avoid raising with other Powers the legal status of that area, they can only do so by proceeding upon the assumption that Trans-Jordan forms part of the area covered by the Palestine Mandate. In default of this assumption Trans-Jordan would be left, under article 132 of the Treaty of Sevres, to the disposal of the principal Allied Powers. Some means must be found of giving effect in Trans-Jordan to the terms of the Mandate consistently with &quot;recognition and support of the independence of the Arabs.&quot;were some form of central Kurdish organisation to which a British Adviser could be attached. This Adviser would be under the orders of the High Commissioner for Mesopotamia, and would report through him. to His Majesty&apos;s Government.We are of opinion that the last act of His Majesty&apos;s Government before the installation of an Arab ruler is announced should be to authorise the High Commissioner to proclaim a general amnesty for all political offences committed by Mesopotamians or Kurds since the commencement of the military occupation.The moral obligation for maintaining the Assyrian and Armenian refugees in Mesopotamia until they can be suitably disposed of rests upon His Majesty&apos;s Government, as distinct from the Mesopotamian Government. The only practicable alternatives, short of a settlement which would enable them to return to their own homes, are, in the case of the Assyrians (a.) Transfer to the French zone ;(6.) Emigration to America under missionary auspices ;in the case of the Armenians (a.) Transfer to the new Armenian State ; (b.) Emigration to America as above.These alternatives are under active examination, and it is hoped that one or other of them may afford a solution. Failing this, we can only suggest that they should be absorbed into the general economic life of Mesopotamia, and that the cost of their maintenance should become a civil charge and be reduced to a minimum.
2. Policy in Pales-tine under the Mandate.3. Policy in Trans-Jordan under the mandate.4. Foreign relations.5. Future adminis-trative arrange-ments (a.) Palestine.(b.) Trans-Jordan.(c.) Judiciary.We do not recommend a separate judiciary for Trans-Jordan. It will probably he convenient to arrange for Trans-Jordan toThe general policy of the Palestine Administration calls for no observations. It is in strict accordance with the terms of the Mandate, and has been attended by the happiest results. There is however, one point on which the High Commissioner has made repeated representations and which we consider demands immediate attention. The development of the country has been seriously hampered by the reluctance of His Majesty&apos;s Government to give effect, pending the confirmation of the Mandate, to the provisions of article 11 relating to industrial concessions. We think it most undesirable that this delay should continue, and consider that cases of real urgency should he taken up forthwith.Certain provisions of the Palestine Mandate are clearly inapplicable in present conditions to Trans-Jordan. At the same time the Mandate is the legal basis of our position in the country, and we must be prepared to meet possible criticism if all its terms are not literally applied to the whole territory for which we accept responsibility. The Mandate itself supplies the answer. In the first place, the preamble provides that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities. In the second place, article 3 obliges the mandatory&apos; to encourage the widest measure of self-Government for localities consistent with the prevailing conditions. We consider that these two clauses, taken in conjunction, afford adequate justification for setting up in Trans-Jordan a political system somewhat different from that in force on the other side of. the river. If British promises are to stand, this system must be Arab in character. We consider that it should preferably be centralised under an Arab ruler acceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government and acting in important matters under their advice. . This would facilitate the appointment in Trans-Jordan of a responsible British Adviser acting under the orders of the High Commissioner for Palestine and reporting through him to His Majesty&apos;s Government.As in the case of Mesopotamia, the Mandate provides for the control by the mandatory of the foreign relations of Palestine and for its defence against foreign attack. Financial and military considerations render it undesirable that His Majesty&apos;s Government should undertake the defence of Trans-Jordan against attack from the desert&apos;or from the Hedjaz. It may prove simpler to leave it to the Arab ruler to conduct his own relations with his Arab neighbours.     . -The administration of Palestine is on a different footing from any other British administration. The High Commissioner is responsible not only to His Majesty&apos;s Government, but, through them, to the League of Nations, This makes it difficult for the Palestine civil services to be assimilated to any existing British service. We consider that it should be an independent service composed of personnel engaged and paid by the Administration of Palestine.We recommend that British personnel employed in Trans-Jordan&apos; should fall under two categories, as in the case of Mesopo-tamia. The British Political Officers will be regarded as members of the Arab Political Service contemplated in the Masterton-Smith Report. They will be engaged and paid in the first instance by His Majesty&apos;s Government, whose servants they will remain.

Arabia-(a.) Subsidies and commitments. .We concur in the general lines of the memorandum on subsidies prepared in the Foreign Office by Colonel Cornwallis on the 16th December, 1920, particularly in the principles that King Hussein and Ibn Saud should receive identical treatment; that financial obligations incurred under existing treaties or agreements should be respected; and that there is no question of immediate payment either to Ibn Rashid or to the Imam Yahya. We are not convinced that sufficient grounds exist for the payment of subsidies to the other Arab rulers who at present receive nothing, though the Resident, Aden, may have recommendations to make in the case of the Idrisi. We consider that all subsidy payments should be made monthly, in arrears, and should be conditional upon the fulfilment

Failure to meet any of the conditions should involve automatic stoppage of subsidy pending explanation, the burden of proof resting on the recipient of the subsidy. Apart from the possible grant of fresh subsidies, we are strongly of opinion that His Majesty&apos;s Government should incur no new liabilities or obligations of any kind, whether military, political, or financial, in the peninsula of Arabia.So far as is consistent with existing treaties we consider that His Majesty&apos;s Government should undertake no responsibility which would involve the despatch of British officers into the interior of Arabia for the purpose of delimiting boundaries or settling disputes.On the assumption that the Government of India concur in the recommendations of the Masterton-Smith Committee, we are of opinion that the Resident in the Persian Gulf should at once resume control of the littoral and of relations with Ibn Saud.We would welcome the early establishment of neighbourly relations with the Imam, even if this necessitated a friendly readjust-ment of the Anglo-Turkish frontier as laid down in 1905.The final separation of Aden from India (assuming that the Government of India accept the Masterton-Smith Report) will cut off the present source of supply of British political officers from the Bombay Presidency. Aden is not large enough to support a self-contained service. For purely political duties, officers of the Arab Political Service will be available, but some other source of supply must be looked to for the administrative staff. The solution may be found in the linking- of Aden with the neighbouring protectorate of Somaliland.We do not suggest that the present administration of Somaliland should be altered or modified in any way. It may however prove convenient for the administration of Somaliland to take the place of the Government of Bombay as the administrative authority for Aden. This&quot; would necessitate the separation of the civil and military functions which are at present combined in one individual at Aden, and &quot;the appointment, of. a civil, functionary there directly responsible to the Governor of Somaliland for administrative questions. He&apos;should have a member of the Political Service on his personal staff, and would communicate direct with the Colonial Office on all political questions affecting the Aden hinterland and adjoining territory. His position would thus be analogous to that of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf if, as recommended by the Masterton-Smith Committee, the latter is made responsible to one &apos; authority in respect of his administrative, and to another in respect -of his political functions. Whether the military command at Aden should be combined with that of Somaliland or not is a question on which this Department are not competent to advise, but the Somali-land Department have furnished a separate memorandum in which they point out that there are strong objections to this course.
PROGRAMME FOR CONFERENCE AT CAIRO.THE Conference will meet for the first time on Saturday, the 12th March. At the first meeting, which will be presided over by the Secretary of State, a general outline will be given of the programme to be followed. A Committee will also be formed to examine military and financial questions. It is essential that this Committee should be given certain data upon which to work. These data must &apos;depend in a varying degree upon political considerations. At the first meeting on Saturday, the 12th, as soon as the Military and Financial Committee has been formed, the first item on the political agenda will be discussed by the Conference. The Committee will immediately start work on the details arising out of the conclusions of the Conference, a Financial Sub-Committee being formed at the discretion of the Chairman (Lieutenant-General Sir W. Congreve, V.C.). The political members of the Conference will at the same time be formed into one or more Political Committees, which will proceed to the discussion of the succeeding items on the political agenda. The Committees will thus be sitting simultaneously, the Political Committee being always in advance of the Military and Financial, which can refer to them any points upon which the data given need amplification. The full Conference will thereafter be called by the Secretary of State as and when necessary to consider any question affecting all three aspects of the matter under discussion.Appendix 4.LIST OF MEMBERS OF THE CONFERENCE, BY MISSIONS.British Mission     ,The   Right.

SECTION II. MESOPOTAMIA. Appendix 5.AGENDA FOR DISCUSSIONS ON MESOPOTAMIA.Political Agenda 1.THE first consideration is the immediate reduction of British military commit-ments in Mesopotamia. No local interest,can be allowed to stand in the way of an immediate programme for reducing the British Army of Occupation. Whatever may be the political status of the country under the mandate, it is out of the question that forces of anything approaching the present dimensions should be supported in Mesopotamia by the British tax-payer. The Conference will consider whether a substantial reduction of say one-third of the existing forces can be*made before the hot weather, basing their discussions on the following general assumptions: (a.) That the area to be controlled will be that for which a mandate has been accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government under the Turkish Treaty.(b.) That it is unnecessary to take into account the possibility of organised military attack from outside this area.(c.) That military commitments outside Basrah. Baghdad- and Mosul and the lines of communication between these centres should be reduced to a minimum, internal tranquillity being promoted so far as possible by political means.(d.) That no force should be retained merely for the purpose of collecting revenue.(e.) That British Political Officers will not be stationed at places off the main1 lines of communication where they will need the support of detachments of Imperial troops.The first point for the Military Committee to consider will be from what garrisons and in what order this immediate reduction can be made. There appear to be three possible alternatives : (i.) To reduce to a minimum the forces now in occupation of the Euphratesline Basrah to Musayib and from Musayib to Hit. (il.) To.reduce to a minimum the forces now in occupation of the Mosul vilayet .   with those which are employed in maintaining lines of communication from Baghdad to Mosul, (iii.) To preserve in skeleton the forces now in occupation of the whole country, reducing proportionately from every garrison.In order to decide which of these alternatives shall form the basis of the detailed recommendations of the Military Committee it will be necessary for the Conference to discuss briefly their political aspect. This is a question which can be considered independently of the political steps which we propose to take in the future.Military Agenda 1.The Committee will discuss three alternatives outlined in paragraph 1 of the Political Agenda, having due regard to the political views expressed at the first meeting of the Conference. In addition to outlining a programme for the immediate withdrawal of a substantial part of the force in Mesopotamia they will consider the following points: (a.) Proportion of British to Indian troops to be withdrawn. (6.) Limitations imposed upon the withdrawal by the necessity for guarding theflank of the Norperforce, (c.) Shipping programme.(d.) Alternative merits of rail and river line of communications with Baghdad. (e.) Desirability or otherwise from the military point of view of entrusting to Arab forces the duty of guarding one or other line of communications.
(/.) Co-operation and respective roles of military and air forces, and provisionof aerodromes. (g.) Recruitment and organisation of Arab forces. (h.) Possible recruitment of Assyrian refugees. (i.) Provision of additional aircraft.(j.) Handing over of military stores and munitions to Mesopotamian Government.(Jc.) Time-table of withdrawal of British and Indian units.Financial Agenda 1. The Sub-Committee will consider the following points: (a.) They will examine present military charges&apos;station by station, unit by uni!and category by category, distinguishing between purely military charges and those arising from ancillary and non-military services. (b.) They will formulate proposals for immediate economies in respect of theforces which will remain in the country after the first withdrawal is complete.(c.) They will prepare rough figures of the saving to Army Estimates involved in the first withdrawal and also in the economies outlined in (&amp;).id.) They will prepare a rough budget showing which items should be regarded as purely military and which items should be regarded as civil and administrative charges. *(e) They will consider the question of a capital expenditure, and discuss the possibility of capital vote being required to meet non-recurring expenditure on such items as construction of barracks, provision of aircraft, &amp;c.Political Agenda 2.The second consideration is the further substantial reduction during the present financial year of the British forces in Mesopotamia. This cannot well be considered independently of the political future of the country, as the garrison so reduced would be dangerously small, unless satisfactory conditions had been, or were in process of being, established at the time. It is generally agreed that no satisfactory conditions can be established in Mesopotamia without the prior formation of a local Govern-ment of real prestige and authority. The form which this Government shall take must therefore be discussed and the following points considered : (a.) Whether there is to be an Arab rulei? or not.(&amp;.) If there is, whether he should be a member of the family of the Sherif of Mecca.(c.) If so, whether there is any member of that family who is clearly preferable to all others, both from the/British point of view and from that of thepeople of Mesopotamia. id.) Whether the Arab ruler should be selected by His Majesty&apos;s government or by the Arab Council of State. (e.) Whether it is desirable or necessary that the National Assembly should meet before the ruler assumes office. (/.) Whether he should offer himself as candidate or whether he should beinvited by Mesopotamia to accept office. (g.) At what stage the offer or invitation should be made. (h.) On what date he should proceed to Baghdad to take up his position as&apos;rulerof the country.Before entrusting to the Military Committee the task of compiling a programme for the withdrawal of the second portion of the British forces now in Mesopotamia, it will be necessary to discuss what prospect there is of it being possible to assume that by the end of the present hot weatheT the further withdrawal can proceed without danger of interference by local elements.Military Agenda 2.(a.) Proportion of British to Indian troops to be withdrawn. (6.) Replacement by local and air forces of all remaining garrisons in Mosul vilayet. -       ,[6117] ^ . G 2
(c.) Shipping programme.Id) Alternative merits of rail and river line of communications with Baghdad. (e.) Desirability or otherwise from the military point of view of entrusting toArab forces the duty of guarding one or other line of communications, (/.) Questions of command, air or military, and respective roles of military andair forces.(g.) Recruitment and organisation of Arab forces. (h.) Possible recruitment of special Assyrian refugees. (i.) Provision of special aircraft.(j.) Handing over of military  stores and  munitions to  Mesopotamian Government.,     (k.) Time-table of withdrawal of British and Indian units.Financial Agenda 2.Preparation of rough figures of further saving to Army Estimates involved in the second withdrawal.Political Agenda 3.Assuming that the Conference have reached general^ agreement on the points relating to the form of the future local government of &quot;Mesopotamia, it will be necessary to discuss the relative positions of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Mesopotamian Government under the mandate. It is not anticipated that an annual contribution of more than 5,000,000 . will be available from Imperial revenues for military expenditure in Mesopotamia for the years 1922-23, 1923-24 and 1924-25. The Military and Financial Committee will be asked to consider the composition and distribution of a permanent garrison based on these figures. In order to provide them with the additional data necessary for this discussion, the following political questions will first be considered, either by the Conference or by a Political Committee: (a.) Whether any modification in the terms of the mandate is desirable from thepoint of view of His Majesty&apos;s Government. (p.) Whether the Mesopotamian Government are likely to demand any modifica-tion from their own point of view. (c.) Whether a possible Arab ruler should be asked to accept the mandate as it stands before assuming office. (d.) Whether we should be content with his provisional acceptance, on theunderstanding that as soon as the Organic Law has been brought intooperation proposals might be considered for a readjustment of relationsbetween His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Mesopotamian Government. (e.) Whether such a readjustment should include a modification of the existing provisions by which the Mandatory controls the foreign relations ofMesopotamia and accepts responsibility for its defence. (/.) If so, in what direction should His Majesty&apos;s Government be prepared to relax their control of foreign relations and thus diminish their own responsibility for defence. (g.) To what extent should the Mesopotamian Government accept full responsibility for maintenance of internal order. .(h.) At what places in Mesopotamia should any British Imperial garrison be stationed, from a political point of view. (i.) Political arguments for the addition to the local forces of the following alternative garrisons :-British regular. Air Force. Indian regular.British irregular or special constabulary. Indian volunteers. ,African or other foreign units. Assyrian units. Yemeni or other Arab units.(i)(2.) (3.)(*.) 5.(6.)(7.) (8.)
Appendix 6. Mesopotamia: Political.FIRST MEETING OF THE POLITICAL COMMITTEE.March 12, 1921. Present:The Right Hon. Winston Spencer Churchill, P.C., M.P. Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., K.C.M.G., &amp;c. Major H. W. Young. Miss Gertrude Bell, C.B.E. Colonel T. E, Lawrence.Mr. R. D. Badcock (Secretary).Political Agenda (1).The Chairman explained that as Sir Percy Cox and General Haldane had already arrived at general agreement on the preliminary withdrawal of troops from Mesopotamia, it was unnecessary for the Committee to discuss the three alternatives detailed in the Agenda.Political Agenda (2).On the invitation of the Chairman, Sir Percy Cox described the steps which he had found it necessary to take when he arrived in Mesopotamia. It had been essential to set up some form of Provisional Government at once, and he had invited the Naqib to form a Cabinet. This Council was not only provisional, but nominated, and it was impossible for Mesopotamian affairs to be conducted by it indefinitely. He felt that he could not return to the country and let it be known that another long delay must ensue before the replacement of the Provisional Council of State by some more competent authority. It was generally agreed that this authority must be a ruler, and the following alternative candidates have been mentioned at one time or another :  1(1.) The Naqib.(2.) Sayed Talib.(3.) Sheikh of Muhammarah.(4.) Ibn Sa&quot;oud.  .(5.) Agha Khan.(6.) Bourhan Ed Din (Turkish Prince).With regard to the first of these, he was convinced that local opinion would never agree on a local candidate, and did not think either had a chance. As regards the Sheikh of Muhammarah, although the fact that he was a Persian subject would not of itself preclude him from consideration as a candidate, Sir Percy Cox did not consider that at present he commanded any very large following, ibn Sa&apos;oud seemed to him out of the question, if only for religious reasons.   He did notMilitary Agenda 3.[a.) Composition of permanent garrison.(b.) Distribution.(c.) Commanb1, air or military.(d.) Relations between Mesopotamian Government, High Commissioner and G.O.C.(e.)

recommend the selection of the Agha Khan, who would, in any case, be unlikely to accept office. There was now reason to think that the demand for a Turkish Prince had been due to specific propaganda by Nihad Pasha, which had since died out. In any case, he presumed that the selection of a Turk could not be considered. There remained as the last alternative a member of the family of the Sherif of Mecca. This solution would, he thought,. be welcomed by the majority of Mesopotamians, provided that it was not too obvious that he was&apos;being nominated by His Majesty&apos;s Government. All the machinery for the election of the National Assembly was in full swing, and if necessary it was possible that within six weeks of his return to Mesopotamia the Assembly would meet and be ready to vote. The question of the date of the elections was however materially affected by the incidence of the month of Ramadan (the 8th May to the 8th June).The Chairman asked whether it was really necessary for the elections to precede the selection of a ruler. He also enquired whether we could really be bound by the decision of the Assembly, as was apparently contemplated in a recent telegram from Baghdad. If the British Government were to spend money on Mesopotamia they could not be expected to acquiesce to the selection of whatever ruler the Assembly might choose. They must insist on the candidate^ name being put before them at some stage for their approval. This could not really be done after a Legislative Assembly had voted for him.Replying to Colonel Lawrence, Sir Percy Cooc said that, unless any more, speedy solution was raised, the selection of a ruler would undoubtedly become an election issue, but that it was common knowledge that our approval of the nominee was. essential, and the people wanted a lead from us. if possible.The Chairman pointed out that it was unprecedented for a Legislative Assembly,, which was theoretically a Government body, to elect the King of the country, and he strongly deprecated the idea. Sir Percy Cox explained that this was not a Legislative Assembly, but a Special Congress called for the purpose of deciding the form of the future Government (i.e., monarch or republic, &amp;c), and if a monarchy then to express their views as to the ruler. He (the Chairman) suggested as an alternative to selection by the National Assembly the immediate formation of a constituent body which could be approached by any candidate approved of by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and which could express a representative opinion for consideration by the Mandatory. Such a body might be to some extent composed of local men of affairs who would suffer by a British evacuation. It should include notables from all parts of the country, and should represent all shades of local opinion. It might number as many as 100 persons. Replying to Miss Bell, he agreed that a place should be found in it for prominent rebel leaders. He emphasised the necessity&apos;for a unanimous decision. Before proceeding to discuss the exact method by which the approved candidate should place his name before the Constituent Assembly, he would be glad to hear the arguments in favour of Sherif Faisal, as opposed to Sherif Abdullah. He asked Sir Percy Cox to explain the reasons why among the sons of the Sherif Faisal was preferable to the others from the Mesopotamian point of view.Sir Percy Cose, replied that he considered faisals previous experience during the war placed him in the best position for raising an army quickly, and his experiences with-the Allies made him better qualified as a ruler than his brothers.Colonel Lawrence supported the candidature of Amir Faisal not only from his personal knowledge of and friendship for the individual, but also on the ground that in order to counteract the claims of rival candidates and to pull together the scattered elements of a backward and half civilised country, it was essential that the first ruler should be an active and inspiring personality. Amir Abdullah was lazy, and by no means dominating.The Chairman pointed out that a strong argument in favour of Sherifian policy was that it enabled His Majesty&apos;s Government to bring pressure to bear on one Arab sphere in order to attain their own ends in another. If Faisal, knew.that not only his fathers subsidy and the protection of the Holy Places from Wahabi attack, but also the position of his brother in Trans-Jordan was dependent upon his own good behaviour, he would be much easier to deal with. The same argument applied mutatis mutandis to King Hussein and Amir Abdullah. The French Government had tried to convince him that by adopting a Sherifian policy he would risk being destroyed, like Frankenstein, by a monster of his own creation.
SECOND MEETING OF THE POLITICAL COMMITTEE. ;March 13, 1921.Present:The Eight Hon. Winston Spencer Churchill, P.C., M.P. Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E, K.C.M.G., &amp;c. Major H. W. Young. *Miss Gertrude Bell, C.B.E. Colonel T. E. Lawrence.Mr. R. D. Badcock (Secretary).The Committee had before them the Minutes of the preceding meeting of thePolitical Committee; A telegram drafted by the Chairman to the Prime Minister; A time-table drawn up by Sir Percy Cox on the procedure to be adopted in theevent of the appointment of the Sherif Faisal (see Annexure).The Chairman read over a draft telegram to the Prime ]\minister , which he had prepared from the previous meeting as a result of the discussion of the previous day. In response to a suggestion by Sir Percy Cox, the wording of the telegram with regard to &quot; British support&quot; of the Sherif Faisal was slightly amended and made somewhat less committal. Other slight amendments were made, notably &quot; in * response to enquiries from adherents of the Emir Faisal,&quot; and the telegram was then agreed to by all present.The Chairman decided to withhold the despatch of the telegram pending further decisions by the Military Committee. He remarked that if he received favourable replies to the queries raised in his telegram he felt sure that he could rely upon Colonel Lawrence to persuade the Sherif to act according to the sugges-tions. He then enquired whether it was necessary for the Council of Notables to be formed, and Sir Percy Cox replied that, in his opinion, the procedure already adopted must be carried out, unless a more prompt method of obtaining an expression of the wishes of the people could be devised.Sir Percy Cox then produced it suggested time-table to carry into effect the procedure recommended in the telegram to the Prime Minister.The Chairman agreed that it would be desirable that the Sherif Faisal should . arrive about Ramadan (the 8th May to the 8th June). It was generally agreed that it was unnecessary for the Council to be first asked to give its views upon the appoint-ment of the Sherif, and it was felt that his presence in Irak would have such an inspiring effect upon the majority of the population that there was little fear of any opposition to his candidature. It was impossible to give the Sherif&apos; a definite assurance to this effect, but he must take his chance.Miss Bell stated that Saved Talib might be expected to offer a certain amount of opposition, but it was probable that this would be negligible when contrasted with the -acclamation with which it was anticipated the Sherif would be received.Colonel Lawrence thought that perhaps the French point of view was unduly coloured by their own experiences in Syria, He did not himself anticipate that a Sherifian policy would have this effect on British interests. Miss Bell agreed, and pointed out that the only pan-Arab propaganda which was at all likely to make headway was the Sherifian propaganda. It was much better to turn this to our own use than to leave it as a potential enemy.The Committee briefly discussed the question of amnesties, and were in agree-ment that at some stage to be decided by Sir Percy Cox, a general amnesty for all political offenders should be proclaimed by His Majesty&apos;s Government. The question of the date for this proclamation and of the successive stages by which the French Government, the Amir Faisal, and the Mesopotamian Government should be informed that, if the Amir Faisal decided to offer himself, and was favoured by the people of Irak, His Majesty&apos;s Government would offer no obstacle to his selection, was reserved for further discussion.
Colonel Lawrence suggested that it would be inadvisable for the Sherif Faisal to make any announcement as to the modification of the Mandate, or the insertion of a saving clause for the future until he delivered his speech from the throne. He emphasised that it was most undesirable that the Sherif should in any way carry on an election campaign in person, and that it was desirable to proceed on the probable assumption that he would be received with unanimous, approval.The Chairman thought that Sherif Faisal should himself come to Irak, rather than that he should send Haddad or some other person to represent him. He suggested that Sir Percy Cox should continue his programme, for the period subsequent to the arrival of the Sherif in. Irak, and that he should submit it at the next meeting of the Committee. He trusted that immediate signs of the approval of the people would be manifested.In reply to a question by the Chairman. Miss Bell stated that she considered that the only possible opposition to be anticipated might &apos;be a movement in favour of the formation of a Commonwealth under the Presidency of the Naqib.The Chairman suggested that Ja&apos;afar Pasha and Sassoon Effendi should be called, and that their opinion should be asked on telegram No. 25 of the 10th March, 1921, from the Acting High Commissioner, to which it was necessary to send some reply.Sir Percy Cox anticipated that ,Ja&apos;afar Pasha would agree that whichever candidate received the support of His Majesty&apos;s Government would succeed. He added that he anticipated that Sassoon Effendi would have preferred to postpone a definite decision as to a ruler for three years, but that he had been inclined to the suggestion for the appointment oj: a Turkish Prince. Ja&apos;afar Pasha was unable to be present, but Sassoon Effendi was called, and an agreed reply prepared, to telegram No. 25 above referred to. The subject of faisals candidature was not broached.THIRD MEETING OF THE POLITICAL COMMITTEE.March 14, 1921.Present:The Right Hon. Winston Spencer Churchill, P.C., M.P. -Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., K.C.M.G., &amp;c. Major H. W. / Young. Miss Gertrude Bell, C.B.E. Colonel T: E. Lawrence.Mr. R. D. Badcock (Secretary).The Committee had before them the Minutes of the second meeting of thePolitical Committee; A revised time-table prepared by Sir Percy Cox on the suggestion of theChairman at the previous meeting..        i &apos;.The question of the foreign relations of Irak under the Mandate was discussed, and it was pointed out that the Mandatory Power was responsible for defending the country from external attack, as well as for the control of its foreign relations. Major Young suggested that it might be possible for the Mesopotamian Government to conduct its own foreign relations with limitrophe States. Sir Percy Cox agreed that the proposal was worthy of consideration, but he stated that until the new ruler was appointed it was a little difficult to formulate definite proposals. He thought, however, that if the future ruler had a British adviser it might be possible to allow him-to deal up to a certain point with the Wali of push-i-Kuh, Ibn Saud, the Shammar and the Wahabi. The Chairman considered that the time was premature to deal with this matter, particularly as it would be impossible for any department other than the Foreign Office to be responsible for relations with Persia. While the suggestion might facilitate relations with limitrophe Arab tribes, the responsibility for the defence of Mesopotamia in this direction miist for the present remain with the British military authorities.
The whole position could be reviewed in October.The&apos; Committee then considered the annexed time table, as revised by Sir Percy Cox, on which a general agreement was reached. The Chairman hoped that it might be possible to obtain the approval of the Cabinet before the Conference had com-pleted its sittings, and it was agreed that the following should be inserted in paragraph 4: &quot; Confirmation by the Secretary of State if approval had not already been secured from the Cabinet.&quot;The Chairman observed that as officials of the High Commissioners Staff were unaware of the proposals which had been agreed to at the Conference it might be possible that certain persons, notably Sayed Talib, might be carrying on personal propaganda with a view to securing the throne, and he suggested that Sir Percy Cox should draft a telegram to the Acting High Commissioner informing him that he should instruct his Staff that all members of the Government should use their best endeavours to promote the policy to be adopted. The telegram was, of course, extremely secret, and it should only be communicated to those whom the Acting High Commissioner considered necessary. But it should be clearly laid down that advisers must, as far as possible, be responsible for the actions -of Ministers.Major the Hon. F. R. Somerset was then called, and the Chairman briefly explained to him. the decisions which had been arrived at during the preceding meeting of the Political Committee. Major Somerset agreed that there was no other alternative to the appointment of a Sherif, but he considered that it would nevertheless be difficult to control anti-French propaganda in Trans-Jordania, owing to the fact that Sherifian supporters in Trans-Jordania came from the French zone. He considered that these were far more concerned with the future of Damascus than of Baghdad. He pointed out the difficulties which would be met in countering anti-French propaganda, owing to the methods adopted by our Allies.In reply to a question by the Chairman, Major Somerset gave his opinion that it would be impossible to effect greater control over propaganda, unless troops were supplied. He considered that it would be unlikely that the Sherif Abdullah would be able to check anti-French feeling. Colonel Lawrence suggested that it would be well to ask the Sherif Abdullah for his advice on the situation. Major Young suggested that it should be made clear to Abdullah that he was being consulted not as representing the Hedjaz, but as a member of the Sherifian family, as it was most undesirable to give the Hedjaz a voice in the discussion on Trans-Jordania. Colonel Lawrence was of opinion that Sherif Abdullah would not remain long in Trans-Jordania, He doubted whether another representative of the family would come there whilst Abdullah was there, and His Majesty&apos;s Government must be to some extent dependent upon his good graces.Major Somerset stated that we should have complete control if there were a small force of British troops, say one squadron of cavalry, in the country, and if two guns (not necessarily of British make) were given to the local forces. The Chairman observed that it would be advantageous if we could have a Sherif in Trans-Jordania whom we could control without troops. Major Somerset was of opinion that no control was possible without troops, and the Chairman preferred that the matter should be left until the arrival of Sir Herbert Samuel, but that in the meanwhile Major Somerset should discuss^the matter with Sir Walter Congreve. Major Somerset then left the meeting.Sassoon Effendi and Ja&apos;afar Pasha were then called. The Chairman explained to them the meeting had very closely examined the political situation, and were inclined to the view that of the several candidates in the field Sherif Faisal seemed the choice calculated best to serve the interests of Irak and the general policy of Great Britain in Arabia. It was suggested that possibly His Majesty&apos;s Government might feel inclined (if the people of Irak wanted him) to make an announcement that they would put no obstacle in Faisal&apos;s way, and if he were chosen by the people, would give him their support. The Chairman observed that there might be other candidates who might also receive support from His Majesty&apos;s Government, though, similarly, there might be candidates who could not receive that support, and it was essential that, whoever the ruler was, he must have the&apos; support of the Mandatory Power. He thought that it might be to the general advantage of the people of Irak if a policy on the lines of the association of the Sherifian family with the British[6117] H
rGovernment were followed in that country, and he pointed out that His Majesty&apos;s Government were anxious not only to establish peace and prosperity in the country, but also to give every assistance to the people. It was difficult at the moment to see another alternative to this proposition, though it was possible that the view of the people might focus in a different manner. He would be glad of the views of Sassoon Effendi and Ja&apos;afar Pasha. Sassoon Effendi considered that there was no objection to the candidature of the Sherif, but he thought that there might be some who would oppose him. J a&apos;afar Pasha remarked that he thought it was essential that the Sherif should visit the country in person, and in reply to a question by the Chairman, he added that it was highly desirable that he snould arrive before the forthcoming election. Sassoon Effendi stated that the Naqib and Sayed Talib might use pro-paganda against the Sherif, and he was doubtful whether they would support him, even if the Sherif communicated his desire to work in conjunction with them. He thought that it was quite possible that the Naqib and Sayed Talib would resign from their posts when they knew of the decision, even if a message were received from the Sherif that he in no way wished to disturb the present Government. He felt that the Shiahs would support the proposal.J a? afar Pasha had often heard people say that they did not dare to mention their desire for the appointment of a member of the Sherifian family, as when they had done so previously the, British Government had taken steps against them. Turkish propaganda had been somewhat active of late, but he thought there was no question of it ever receiving the support of the Shiahs.Both Sassoon Effendi and Ja&apos;afar Pasha agreed that the case of Ibn Saud could not be considered, and they were of opinion that of the three men whom they con-sidered as the most prominent candidates, namely, Sayed Talib, the Naqib and the Sherif Faisal, the last named would be the most welcome to the country at large.Annexuke.TIME-TABLE.1.

April 18. Mon,6. Sherif Faisal would have arranged to arrive at Mecca about the same date. He would after about a week, say on the 23rd, telegraph to Nuri, Ja&apos;afar and any other influential friends of his, saying that, having been repeatedly urged by his friends to come to Mesopotamia, and the British Govern-ment, in reply to his enquiries, having informed him that if the people of Mesopotamia wanted him they were not disposed to stand in his way, he had discussed the matter ywith his father and brothers and had decided to offer his services to Irak. That he was writing more fully the plat-form on which he was prepared to stand, but that he was prepared to accept the terms of the mandate as laid before&apos; the League of Nations, provided that the British Govern-ment would agree to an additional clause making it possible that, by understanding between the parties, the terms of the mandate could be modified at any time after the passing of the law of the Constitution and its approval by the League of Nations, into the form of a treaty, providing on the one hand for the continuance of. the help and support of the mandatory, and on the other for the adequate safe-guarding and maintenance of the latter&apos;s special interests and privileged position in Irak.

It is expected that faisals announcement, followed by his arrival in the countrv, would result in such a definite expression of public feeling on his behalf as would make it unnecessary for us to ask the Congress to discuss the question of the ruler; they would simply confirm directly or indirectly his nomination.9. Having done this, Faisal would dissolve the present Provisional Government, i.e., the Council of Ministers, and call the Naqib, or someone else, to form a Cabinet.Appendix 7. Mesopotamia: Military.FIRST MEETING OF MILITARY COMMITTEE.March 12, 1921. Present:Lieutenant-General Sir W. Congreve (President).General Haldane.General Radcliffe.General Atkinson.General Ironside.Air-Marshal Trenchard.Air-Vice-Marshal Salmond. %J. B. Crosland, Ksq.Colonel Stewart.Colonel Frith.&quot;Colonel Slater.Wing-Commander Gossage.Wing-Commander. Burnett.Major Eadie.Lieutenant-Colonel Waters Taylor (Secretary).The following proposals are made on the assumption that it is unnecessary for the G.O.C.-in-C. in Mesopotamia to take into account the possibility of organised attack or intrigue from outside or serious internal disturbance. It is understood that any reinforcements required to deal with such emergencies, if and when they arise, would have to be provided for from elsewhere.2. The G.O.C.-in-C, Mesopotamia, agreed that all outlying detachments could be withdrawn and the troops concentrated on the line Mosul-Baghdad-Basra, provided internal security and the maintenance of order outside the areas of opera-tion of the garrisons become the responsibility of the Civil Government, supported by the Royal Air Force (vide Air-Marshal&apos;s paper).On the assumption given above, the G.O.C.-in-C, Mesopotamia, agrees that the Army of Occupation can be reduced to twenty-two battalions of infantry, plus certain units of other arms as shown in the attached Table III.The limiting factor in the speed of reduction is at present that of shipping available at Basra. The Committee draw attention to the fact that while four battalions per week could have been shipped from Basra, commencing the 15th February last, shipping for approximately three per week only has been forthcoming. In addition to units approximately, there are some 23,000 demobilisable Indian sepoys and Indian labourers to be shipped oversea. At the present rate at which ships are becoming available, the units and men and the units from North-West Persia now awaiting transport will not be cleared off before the 15th August next.[6117] &apos; H 2

Shipping programme, for additional units it is proposed to reduce, giving dates available for embarkation from a zero date, is attached.6. The river line of communication with Baghdad is imperative from the military point of view, and owing to the large number of troops which would be required to guard the railway from Basra to Baghdad, it is not proposed to hold that line.7. It is not considered desirable that the communications upon which any British force depends should be entrusted to the protection of Arab levies for the time being.8. Ja&apos;afar Pasha&apos;s proposals for the recruitment and organisation of Arab forces have been submitted to a Military Committee composed as follows:  .General Ironside (President). Colonel Cornwallis. Colonel Slater. Major Eadie. Ja&apos;afar Pasha.9. The Military Committee are of the opinion that it is undesirable to incur capital expenditure upon permanent barracks and accommodation for the garrison - and Royal Air Force until a decision as to the ultimate strength and location of the troops of occupation has been arrived at. They consider that temporary hutments fitted with electric light and fans and all other practicable amenities should be provided for all British troops, and temporary cantonments for all Indian troops, such accommodation being absolutely necessary to maintain the health and content-ment of the army.Table III.

A Committee composed as under was appointed to consider Ja&apos;afar Pasha&apos;s scheme for the formation of an Arab army: -   General Ironside (President). Colonel Cornwallis. Colonel Slater. Major Eadie. Ja&apos;afar Pasha.3. Air-Marshal Trenchard handed in a paper with his proposals for the distri-bution and functions of the Royal Air Force in Mesopotamia upon the reduction of the garrison (Air-Marshal Trenchard&apos;s paper attached). The Air-Marshall proposals were considered and approved by the Committee.The Air-Marshal also handed in a scheme for the control of Mesopotamia by the Royal Air Force, which was issued to senior members of the Committee to be read and discussed at the next meeting of the Committee.4. A minute to the President from the Secretary of State was received and communicated to the Committee, The following points at issue to be discussed with the Political Conference were formulated on paragraph 2 of the Secretary of State&apos;s minute : (a.)&apos; Can we act on the assumption in paragraph 2 of minutes of the first meeting?(b.) How far can the garrison be withdrawn if not replaced by the Arab army ?
Distribution and Functions of the Royal Air Force when the present Garrison in Mesopotamia has been reduced by one-third before this hot weather, as mentioned in the first paragraph of Political Agenda I, and the Air Force are still under Military Control.1. Total number of squadrons, 6. (One more squadron to be ordered from India to Mesopotamia at once.)These squadrons to be distributed as follows : Shaibah.   No. 84 Squadron. D.H.9a.Baghdad. No.  6 Squadron. Bristol Fighter.No.  8 Squadron. D.H.9a.No. 30 Squadron. D.H.9a.   Snipe.Baghdad.  No.  1 Squadron. Snipe (from India).Mosul.     No. 55 Squadron. D.H.9a.Mosul has been selected instead of Shergat for the following reasons: (a.) There will be a British garrison at Mosul, according to the scheme outlinedat this morning&apos;s Military Committee. (&amp;.) Mosul is a better health&quot;station than SEergat. (c.) A supply of reserve stores will be located at Mosul.2. The functions of the army would be as follows : (a.) It is understood that at this stage the army will be responsible for the - following:  Mosul, Baghdad and Basra.lb.) The communications between these three places by rail and river. (c.) The supply of forces necessary at these places for the above work.The duty of the Royal Air Force would be: ;(a.) Routine visiting of all areas and political officers within radius of aircraft operating from these three stations, but only landing at certain specified -aerodromes which can be considered locally. (b.) Such action as is considered necessary by political officers, which would include demonstration of force, in this area. (c.) Punitive action as ordered by the High Commissioner, if approved by theG.O.C.-in-C, within this area if the Air Officer Commanding considers the force at his disposal sufficient for the work. (d.) Co-operation with the army within the immediate vicinity of their garrison. (e.) Supervision of all wireless.(/.) Visiting of all aerodromes in the country which the air officer commanding regards as suitable and the political officers consider of use.3. Distribution of responsibility between the army and the air force. 4For all operational purposes within a defined limit of Basra, Baghdad andMosul, the air officer commanding would act under the orders of the G.O.C.-in-C,Mesopotamia.For all operational purposes outside these limits the Air Officer Commanding would be responsible for the carrying out of such purely air operations as might be required by the High Commissioner under the general orders of the G.O.C.-in-C.(Signed)    ,   H. TRENCHARD,Chief of Air Staff.March 12, 1921.Note. I have still kept to the principle of the G.O.C.-in-C. being responsible for all operations, air and others, in the country during this stage, as the Air Force have not yet got the necessary squadrons and organisations, such as wireless, intelli-gence, &amp;c, in the country to start the Air Force scheme of complete control and responsibility. It is considered, however, that by the above method the Air Force would be employed under the G.O.C.-in-C. on the lines on which they will be employed when an adequate air organisation is set up.(Initialled)       H.

Appendix 8. Mesopotamia: Political and Military.FIRST MEETING OF THE COMBINED POLITICAL AND MILITARYCOMMITTEES.March 13, .1921. Present:The Right Hon. Winston Spencer Churchill, M.P. (Chairman). Sir Percy Cox, G.C.I.E., K.C.S.I.Lieutenant-General Sir Walter Congreve, V.C., K.C.B. (Chairman of theMilitary Committee). Lieutenant-General Sir J. A. L. Haldane, K.C.B., D.S.O. , Air-Marshal Sir H.

Lawrence. Colonel B. H. S. Waters-Taylor, C.B.E. Major H. W. Young, D.S.O. Miss Gertrude Bell, C.B.E. Major Eadie, D.S.O.Wing-Commander E. L. Gossage, D.S.O., M.C. R. D. Badcock, M.C. (Secretary).The Committee had before them the minutes of the meeting of the Military Committee of the previous day.The Chairman stated that as the Military Committee had been able to make such rapid progress under the able chairmanship of Lieutenant-General Sir Walter Congreve. he was pleased to be able to call a joint meeting of the Political and Military Committees. He pointed out that it was essential that the reductions of troops must be accelerated by all possible means, and that very considerable economies must be effected without delay. The modified garrison would cost approximately 25 millions per annum, and he trusted that expenditure would eventually come down to about two-thirds of this figure, provided the reductions continued. He emphasised-sised that he would spare no effort to supply the necessary shipping, and he hoped that it would be possible to meet the need from India and elsewhere.Replying to a question by the Chairman, Lieutenant-General Sir J. A. L. . Haldane stated, if shipping were available, it would be possible to reduce the garrison at the rate of 3,000 men per week. Lieutenant-General Sir Walter Congreve pointed out that if the garrison were rapidly reduced it would be down to the basis of twenty-two battalions before the force being raised by Ja&apos;afar Pasha was ready to take over. Sir Percy Coo; stated that such a rapid reduction would leave him in a very difficult position, and he emphasised the necessity for the maintenance of troops in stations other than the three -Mosul, Baghdad and Basra proposed by the Military Committee, until such time as the new force was trained and ready, which could not be before 1922.The Chairman, whilst agreeing that the situation was a somewhat difficult one, emphasised the fact that the British taxpayer could not be expected to continue to garrison the country at such high expense, and that rapid economies must be effected before the new financial year. He fully realised that the Military Commanders wished to refrain from placing a number of small detachments about the country involving long lines of communications, and risking the destruction of such forces in the event of hostile action, yet he thought that it must be possible to find a medium whereby the General Officer Commanding might meet the High Commissioner by slightly increasing the number of stations from the three suggested.  At the same
time it was essential that the training of the local forces should be accelerated as much as possible. Although the army might run slight risks, and although the local forces would not be so perfectly trained as was desirable before taking up their duties, the essential economies would be effected. He pointed out that the latest information with regard to negotiations with the Turkish Government gave hopes that we might perhaps expect to be immune from serious attack from that quarter, which would greatly improve our position in Mosul, and might make it more possible for the General Officer Commanding somewhat to amend his proposed distribution.In reply to a question by the Chairman, Air-Marshal Sir II. M. Trenchard stated that he was unable to take over the responsibility of guarding communications at present, as the Air Force was not yet in a position to do so. He hoped that a year hence it might be possible to lend more active assistance, which would then make it possible further to reduce the garrison.The Chairman suggested that it might be possible to arrange to subsidise the villages on the lines of communications and in return make them responsible for safeguarding the railway. Sir Percy Cox was of opinion that the time was scarcely ripe to place such a trust upon a populace which had so recently been in revolt against us.On the Chairman enquiring how it was that when approximately 50,000 troops had been sent into the country, and even now twenty-five battalions had not yet gone, he was informed that fourteen new battalions, six from Palestine and eight from India, were being despatched in relief of troops who had long been stationed in Mesopotamia.The Chairman pointed out that economy could be effected in this system of putting troops in with one hand and taking them out with the other, and he suggested that it should receive the special attention of a sub-committee.Replying to a question by the Chairman, Mr. Crosland stated that the estimates for 1921-22 for the garrisons of Mesopotamia and Palestine had been put (before the Cabinet reduction to 28-^ million pounds) at a round total of 30 million pounds, though, as a matter of fact, owing to possible charges for relief units in India in 1921-22 and Indian charges relating to reinforcements of 1919 still to be sent back to India, the total might be somewhat larger perhaps 31f millions apart from reductions and economies which this Conference were now considering. Taking the round 30 million pounds, Mr. Crosland was unable to say exactly what portion would represent the Palestine cost, but he thought about 3-^ million pounds; this would leave 26-^ millions for Mesopotamia. He stated that the G.O.C. had already commenced to effect very considerable reductions in Indian labour, which would show corresponding reductions in expenditure, apart from the proposed reduction in the number of troops. Secondly; he trusted that a further saving on labour coujd be effected by the actual reduction of troops; when the troops were reduced it would be necessary to cut down correspondingly the labour and departmental charges, but it must be remembered that many of these charges inevitably continued for some time after the reductions in troops had been effected. He pointed out that we had to pay charges for Indian troops for three months after their return to India.The Chairman was of opinion that no definite decision could be come to at this stage, and he requested that Sir Walter Congreve would form a special committee during the afternoon composed ofSir Percy Cox,Air-Marshal Sir H. M. Trenchard. Lieutenant-General Sir J. A. L. Haldane. Major-General Sir P. P. de B. Radcliffe. Major-General S. W. E. Ironside. Major-General H. H..de V. Atkinson.and that they should consider in regard to Table III, attached to the minutes of the first meeting of the Military Committee, in what way it could be applied place by place to the present situation, in order that assistance might be given to the local Government without undue risk to the number of &quot; concentrated forces&quot; advocated iby the Chief of the General Staff.The Chairman requested that Major-General Sir P. P. de B. Radcliffe would draw up, in consultation with Colonel Stewart and Colonel Frith, a telegram to the War Office, on the assumption that the scheme for the maintenance of the twenty-two
battalions should be adopted, asking them to defer despatch of the fourteen battalions destined for Mesopotamia, while relieving so far as possible those units which must necessarily leave the country. The amount of shipping required to carry out the immediate reduction of the garrison should also be worked out.SECOND MEETING OF THE COMBINED POLITICAL AND MILITARYCOMMITTEES.March 14, 1921. Present:The Right Hon. Winston Spencer Churchill, M.P. (Chairman). Sir Percy Cox, G.C.I.E., K.C.S.I.Lieutenant-General Sir Walter Congreve, V.C., K.C.B. (Chairman of theMilitary Committee). Lieutenant-General Sir J. A. L. Haldane, K.C.B., D.S.O. Air-Marshal Sir H. M. Trenchard, Bart., K.C.B, D.S.O. Major-General Sir P. P. de B. Radcliffe, K.C.M.G., C.B., D.S.O:    .

Mia j or Eadie.Wing-Commander E. L. Gossage, D.S.O., M.C. Ja&apos;afar Pasha,R. D. Badcock, M.C. (Secretary).The Committee had before them the minutes of the previous meeting of the combined Political and Military Committees, and advanced copies of the minutes of the Special Committee assembled to enquire into the possible redistribution of the forces in Mesopotamia.In response to an enquiry by the Chairman as to whether Mr. Crosland had made any computation of the relief to expenditure which would be afforded by the reductions foreshadowed in the discussion at the previous meeting, he was informed that, provided shipping were made available and local charges cut down, it would probably amount to about 2^ million pounds for Indian troops and 1 million for British.The Chairman pointed out that, although the number of troops was being reduced by about one-third, yet the reduction in expenditure on Mr. Crosland&apos;s estimate would only amount to one-seventh of the total, a very low proportion. He directed that further enquiry should be made with a view to ensuring that ooncur-rently with the reduction of troops a proportionate reduction in expenditure would be effected. Similarly, he trusted that a saving would be effected throughout the establishments, particularly in regard to stores, and by the substitution of junior for senior officers as the responsibility of commands became modified with the reduc-tion of numbers. He stated that he proposed to accept the second report of the Military Committee as a basis, and that he now proposed that the meeting should take measures to make those reductions effective. He asked Major-General Sir P. P. de B. Radcliffe to reassemble his sub-committee of the previous day, and to expand the draft telegram which had been prepared by that Committee, for despatch by the Chairman to the Secretary of State for War.The additional points for consideration were: (a.) To calculate the maximum rate at which the troops specified could arrive at Basra, provided the necessary shipping was available. The Chairman took upon himself the responsibility of arranging the latter.   There[6117]. &apos; I
would of necessity be some slight delay at the best in the arrival of the shipping, but he emphasised that troops should continue to assemble at Basra so as to be ready for embarkation immediately shipping was made available.To consider the best method of obtaining the shipping, which the Govern-ment of India might be&quot; able to arrange. For this it would be essential to give a definite statement of the amount of shipping required. To report on the best method of making, concurrently with the reduction of troops, a proportionate saving in expenditure on stores and equipment and administrative charges, embodying any necessary recommendations&quot; in the telegram mentioned. To enquire into the best method of disposing of the 25,000 animals which would become surplus to establishment, bearing in mind that an estimate should be made of the greatest number available for disposal, and that this figure should only allow of the barest minimum required by the garrison. All surplus animals should be disposed of prior to the 31st March, 1921, and it would be necessary to embody the recommendations of the Committee in a telegram for the consideration of the Director of Remounts at the War Office.Replying to an enquiry by the Chairman, Mr. Crosland stated that the estimate for feeding the animals now in Mesopotamia amounted to If million pounds. The Chairman pointed out that a considerable saving could therefore be effected, not only by the sale of some of the animals, but also by reducing the number to be fed.(e.) Mr. Crosland explained that there was an expenditure of over 2 millions for Indian relief units in India. It was decided that recommendations for reduction under this head should be included in the telegram.The Chairman asked that Lieutenant-General Sir J. A. L. Haldane and his staff should commence to consider the order of departure of the units, bearing in mind that certain Indian units especially required relief.(/.) Lieutenant-General Sir J. A. L. Haldane pointed out that the forces in Mesopotamia were living upon the accumulation of stores in the country, and that there was a large surplus.The Chairman suggested that the Civil Government might welcome the oppor-tunity of purchasing those not required by the army, and he suggested that the matter should be discussed by Sir Percy Cox and the General Officer Commanding. He emphasised that it was false economy for the Disposals Board to keep a large staff to look after surplus stores, and that it would be better to arrange for their immediate disposal, even if they were sold at a very low rate.The Chairman said that his general policy was to continue to reduce on the lines proposed until October 1921, when the whole question could&quot; again be reviewed in the light of political developments of our relations with the Turkish Government, and of progress achieved in the formation of local forces. He emphasised that the present reductions were only to be regarded as a temporary measure up to October, when it would be essential to endeavour to make a further saving, which he hoped would bring the forces in Mesopotamia down to approximately the permanent garrison of about 15,000 men. This would make it possible to consider the question of canton-ments and housing for the permanent garrison.
THIRD MEETING OF THE COMBINED POLITICAL AND MILITARYCOMMITTEES.March 15, 1921.Present:The Right Hon. Winston Spencer Churchill, M.P. (Chairman). Sir Percy Cox, G.C.I.E., K.C.S.I.Lieutenant-General Sir Walter Congreve, V.C., K.C.B. (Chairman of theMilitary Committee). Lieutenant-General Sir J. A. L. Haldane, K.C.B., D.S.O. Air-Marshal Sir H. M. Trenchard, Bart., K.C.B., D.S.O. Major-General Sir P. P. de B. Radcliffe, K.C.M.G., C.B., D.S.O. Air-Vice-Marshal Sir G. Salmond, K.C.M.G., &amp;c. Major-General S. W. E. Ironside, K.C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O. Major-General E. H. de V. Atkinson, C.B., C.M.G., C.I.E. J. B. Crosland, Esq. Colonel J. H. K. Stewart, D.S.O. Colonel G. R. Frith, C.M.G., D.S.O., R.E. Colonel T. E. Lawrence. Colonel B. H. S. Waters-Taylor, C.B.E. Major H. W. Young, D.S.O. Miss Gertrude Bell, C.B.E. Major Eadie.Wing-Commander E. L. Gossage, D.S.O., M.C. R. D. Badcock, M.C. (Secretary).The Committee had before them : (1.) The report of the Sub-Committee, presided over by General Sir P. P. de B. Radcliffe.(2.) The report of Major-General Ironside&apos;s Sub-Committee on the formation of the local forces in Mesopotamia,The Chairman stated that as Sir Percy Cox had not had the opportunity of being present at the meeting of General Ironside&apos;s Committee, and had not been able fully to consider the report submitted by it, it would be left over until the following day.The Chairman then read the report of General Radcliffe&apos;s Committee. In reply to the Chairman Mr. Crosland pointed out that he assumed that the reduction of the 10 battalions from the 33-battalion to the 23-battalion scale would commence in June next, and that the Indian troops would therefore cease to be a charge sub-sequent to September 1921. He trusted that there would be a large saving in countermanding the order for units proceeding to Mesopotamia to relieve units there. The Chairman noted that the Committee had amended the proportion of British and Indian units so that the garrison would now be 4 British battalions and 19 Indian battalions to complete the 23-battalion scheme. He observed that the expenditure would be somewhat increased by this alteration, but as he fully appreciated the view of the general staff in their desire to maintain a sufficient number of British battalions, he was anxious to do his best to meet them.In reply to an enquiry by the Chairman, Lieut-General Haldane stated that he preferred Indian battalions to British at the present time, and Mr. Crosland pointed out that the cost of an Indian battalion in Mesopotamia was approximately one-half that of a British battalion.General Radcliffe pointed out that with the exception of the Welsh Guards, there were exactly the same number of British battalions in the army to-day as in the pre-war army, and that there were no reserves, though we had far greater commitments.After further discussion it was found that further savings could be effected elsewhere, and the Chairman agreed that the new establishment should stand. He noticed that there were still *dx units which were proceeding to Mesopotamia in[6117] I 2
relief of others, and he felt that it was impossible to justify this expenditure, as it meant not only an additional charge, but also the temporary prevention of the reduction of the number of troops now in Mesopotamia awaiting embarkation.General Sir J. A. L. Haldane pointed out that six of the battalions in Mesopotamia were not only weak but comparatively inefficient, and he was anxious, in view of the proposed reductions, that the remaining units should be of a high standard of efficiency.General Radcliffe observed that the political difficulties in India which arose from the retention of Indian units long since due for relief were of great importance, and it was finally decided to meet the charge half way by only sending three battalions instead &quot;of six..The Chairman enquired whether batteries had been reduced from a six to a four-gun establishment. General Haldane replied that this had already been effected, and that he preferred to have more batteries, but smaller ones, rather than larger units, even though the total number of guns in the force were the same. He gave his opinion that howitzers were far preferable to field guns as it was found by experience that owing to the low trajectory the latter were not so effective as the former, particularly in the fighting in canals and steep wadis.Crosland thought that the charge of millions for Indian troops main-tained in India to provide reliefs could not be entirely debited to Mesopotamia, half-a-million might be assumed to relate to Indian troops in Egypt, Palestine, &amp;c.General Haldane gave his opinion, in reply to the Chairman, that it would be impossible for the followers and labour companies to march down to the base, as they would only be a source of public insecurity.The question of the rate at which troops could be made available at the base for embarkation was then discussed. General Atkinson stated that the first train should have got through to Baghdad from Basrah in about one month after his departure from Mesopotamia, which would be at about the present time. The efficiency of the line was, however, not great. Political officers had already been endavouring before his departure to make arrangements for the safe custody of the route by local forces.The Chairman emphasised the necessity of actually getting the troops out of the country, as it was only by this means that immediate savings could be made. He requested Sir Percy Cox to despatch a priority telegram to the Acting High Com-missioner in the sense that every effort should be made to accelerate the repair and efficient running of the railway. It was agreed that in view of the possibility of - improved communications it might be possible to raise the maximum rate of delivery of troops per week from 5,000 to 6,000. The Chairman hoped that the despatch of the auxiliary personnel could be accelerated, and that Indian followers would be given preference, not only because they were more expensive, but because it was necessary to pay them daily, whereas local labour was only paid for the number of actual working days.Colonel Frith observed that it would be false economy to keep large numbers of Indian labour idle at the base awaiting shipping, whilst employing local labour, but it was to be hoped that economies could be made in this direction.The Chairman requested Mr. Crosland and Colonel Prith to discuss the matter embodying their conclusions in the final draft telegram.The Chairman enquired whether it would not be possible to effect a reduction in the charge for petrol consumption, which amounted to one million pounds. It was pointed out that this figure included the transport for the withdrawal of the forces in Persia as well as those in Mesopotamia. He observed that from experience in Prance it was found that it was an economy to dispose of cars at once rather than keep them in depots under the control of the Disposals Board where the engines deteriorated.   There was a continual demand for men to guard them.The Chairman then read the financial report, submitted by Mr. Crdsland.Replying to the Chairman, Air-Marshal Sir Hugh Trenchard pointed out that the squadron which it was proposed to bring from India would be able to police outlying districts, and that it would be a saving to the Indian Government who were already reducing by two squadrons, but he thought that it would scarcely be possible
FOURTH MEETING OF THE COMBINED POLITICAL AND MILITARYCOMMITTEES.March 16, 1921. Present:The Right Hon. Winston Spencer Churchill, M.P. (Chairman). v Sir Percy Cox, G.C.I.E., K.C.S.I.Lieutenant-General Sir Walter Congreve, V.C., K.C.B. (Chairman of theMilitary Committee). Lieutenant-General Sir J. A. L. Haldane, K.C.B., D.S.O. Air-Marshal Sir H. M. Trenchard, Bart., K.C.B., D.S.O. Major-General Sir P. P. de B. Radcliffe, K.C.M.G., C.B., D.S.O.   &apos; Air-Vice-Marshal Sir G. Salmond, K.C.M.G., &amp;c. Major-General S. W. E. Ironside, K.C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O. Major-General E. H. de V. Atkinson, C.B., C.M.G., C.I.E. J. B. Crosland, Esq. Colonel J. H. K. Stewart, D.S.O. Colonel G. R. Frith, C.M.G., D.S.O., R.E. Colonel T. E. Lawrence. Colonel B. H. S. Waters-Taylor, C.B.E. Major H. W. Young, D.S.O. Miss Gertrude Bell, C.B.E. Major Eadie.Wing-Commander E. L. Gossage, D.S.O., M.C. R. D. Badcock, M.C. (Secretary).The Committee had before them the report of the Sub-Committee held under the presidency of Lieut.-General Sir Walter Congreve, at which Sir Percy Cox was present, and which was held on the 15th March, 1921.. It hadto obtain any compensation from that source. Tt might, however, be worthy of consideration.The Chairman asked General Radcliffe to look into the question of veterinary services and the Army Chaplains Department, and to ensure that a proportional reduction was made. He asked Mr. Crosland to frame an estimate of the cost of the Kirkuk garrison, which would probably amount to approximated 1 million pounds. Such a charge was hardly justified in view of the value of the Kirkuk Division which compared unfavourably with much larger districts in certain other Colonies. for which nothing like so large an expenditure was sanctioned. He wished to emphasise this point, and he trusted that every effort would be made to replace the garrison by the local forces.General Haldane brought forward the question of disproportionate expenditure on such public works as electric light and power stations, &amp;c, which, although necessary in the past, could not be justified with a reduced force. He submitted that some of these should be taken over by the Civil Government, who might find them of considerable value.The Chairman asked that a financial committee should meet under the presidency of Mr. Crosland to enquire into this matter. Mr. Crosland said that an immediate saving could be made by the disposal, either by destruction or otherwise, of animals, and also by the disposal of the large accumulation of useless stores and surplus ammunition.The Chairman directed that a telegram should immediately be despatched requesting sanction from the Home Authorities for the local destruction of such stores, due precaution being taken to ensure that they could not, at any time, be used against our forces.The Chairman then stated that when the committees had completed their reports, it would be possible to pass to the second stage of the Conference, and he read some observations which he had made for the information of members, and which were being circulated.
been impossible to complete the report in so far as no consideration had been given to the Air-Marshal&apos;s proposals for the control of Mesopotamia by Royal Air Force.The Chairman stated that he had had a further consultation with Sir Percy Cox and General Ironside, and that he had decided to reconstitute the Sub-Committee formed under the presidency of the latter.The Political Committee had discussed the Kurdish question, and although no definite decisions had been made, it appeared probable that it would be preferable for the High Commissioner in Iraq to deal direct with the head of a separate Kurdish State rather than to place the Kurds under an Arab Government.The garrison for Kirkuk and Mosul under the twenty-three battalion scheme amounted to eight battalions, and as there appeared every possibility of a plentiful supply of suitable material from Kurdish sources to create local forces, he trusted that it would be possible to relieve the British garrison in the near future. He would ask Sir Percy Cox to preside over the revised Committee, which should include :--General Sir P. P. de B. Radcliffe General Sir W. E. Ironside. Colonel Slater. Major Eadie. Ja&apos;afar Pasha.and which should have in view the formation of these Kurdish forces.The advanced copy of the report of General Sir Walter Congreve&apos;s Sub-Committee was then read over. The Chairman stated that a Committee formed by the Adjutant-General had already considered certain recommendations for the forma-tion of a class of gendarmerie similar to the Cape Mounted Rifles, which had been regarded with favour by the Prime Minister. General Radcliffe reminded the Chairman that the Adjutant-General&apos;s Committee had not recommended the adoption of the suggestion, which would cost 250/. per head extra per annum, as compared with local police.The Chairman wished to emphasise that it must be the aim of the General Officer Commanding to obtain the maximum number of actual fighting troops ready for the field, and he suggested that it might be more efficient and economical to employ local or Indian labour for the menial duties, on which the fighting men of units were often employed. British troops, which were the backbone of the British Empire, were extremely costly and therefore every endeavour should be made to make the best use of them. He felt that this was not being done so long as they were being employed upon menial duties. In fact many units were only actually at half their strength on this account. He did not wish to press the point, but he was anxious that Sir Percy Cox would give the suggestion his close consideration. General Sir Walter Congreve observed that there was always the danger in the employment of Indian and local personnel-^-of their deserting as soon as fighting commenced. 4-nother difficulty was that, for medical reasons, doctors were averse from the employment of local or Indian labour in cook-houses.The Chairman stated that he fully appreciated the folly of maintaining weak units with excessive overhead charges, and it should be an axiom in deciding the composition of the garrison, that the smallest number of units should be employed with the largest possible fighting strength. He was of opinion that, particularly in Mesopotamia and similar unhealthy countries, the Government would do well to employ a proportion of local labour. Good barracks should be provided, and by keeping the troops in good health we should thus maintain maximum strength ready for emergencies, and the minimum establishment with concurrent expenditure.General Haldane observed that it would be unwise to expend large sums upon barracks when&apos; it was possible that the future garrison might be greatly reduced by the substitution of local forces and by the Royal Air Force taking over control. It was decided that this should receive consideration when General Sir Walter Congreve&apos;s Committee reassembled to discuss the proposals of the Chief of the Air Staff.The Chairman asked General Radcliffe and General Congreve to discuss the possibility of the employment in Mesopotamia of Indian volunteers recruited for foreign service from the Indian army.
The Chairman then read a telegram which he proposed to despatch to the Prime Minister forthwith.The Chairman gave his approval to the suggestion of General Haldane for the further reduction of the garrison in Mesopotamia to sixteen battalions, to be followed by a further reduction of four battalions in three months. He instructed Mr. Crosland to prepare an estimte of the saving in expenditure resulting from the reduction in the first phase (a) Assuming it to commence in October next, with a second reduction in January.(&amp;.) Assuming it to commence in January next, with a second reduction in April.(c.) For both reductions to take place in October next, on the supposition that possibly local forces would be ready by then. (d.) For both reductions in January next, on the supposition that possibly local forces would be ready by then.In reply to a question by Sir Percy Cose, the Chairman replied that if the local Government were unable to pay for the local forces from the revenue of the country, it might perhaps be possible to make a small grant in aid, provided the total amount expended on the Imperial garrison, and the grant did not exceed the 5,000,0007. per annum, which as he had stated at a previous meeting had been agreed upon for Mesopotamia. The Air-Marshal stated that the present cost of the air forces in Mesopotamia was 900,000/., which was a charge on the air force vote, so that if this were transferred to the vote of the Middle East we should be that much in hand.The Chairman stated that he hoped there would be savings elsewhere, which had not been included in the reductions he had submitted to the Prime Minister, but it was almost inevitable that they would find in practice that it did not effect such actual savings as those estimated.The Chairman stated that there would be five or six squadrons of aeroplanes in Mesopotamia, and that the main repairing depot would be at Baghdad. He suggested that it would be well for the General Staff to give their closest considera-tion to the desirability, both from the point of view of efficiency and economy, of combining this repair depot with that of the armoured cars and mechanical transport.Mr Crosland stated that the estimated cost of the garrison for Kirkuk, which the Chairman had instructed him to prepare at the previous meeting of this Committee, was 1,000,000?. at a minimum.Annexure to Appendix 8.REPORT OF GENERAL RADCLIFFE&apos;S SUB-COMMITTEE.March 14, 1921..* President:General Sir P. P. de B. Radcliffe.Members:Colonel J. H. Stewart. Colonel G. R. Frith. J. B. Crosland, Esq.1. The maximum rate at which troops can be ready for embarkation is 5,000 per week.2. On the 26th February the situation was : At Basra awaiting embarkation : Troops .........        ...     10,000Casuals and labour       ...        ...        ...     10,000Total       ...        ...        ...     20,000
It is estimated that 9,000 of these have been embarked up to the present date, leaving at Basra some 11,000 to be embarked. There will remain in Mesopotamia, exclusive of the further reduction of ten battalions and other units which the Conference has recommended, 32,000 troops, labour, &amp;c. Thus, at the present date, there are in Mesopotamia awaiting embarkation 43,000 men. At the present rate of 3,000 per week, 18,000 can be embarked by the end of April, at which date it is assumed additional ships, to embark up to a maximum of 5,000 a week, would become available.Therefore, if shipping for 5,000 men per week is made available at Basra in six weeks from to-day (the 14th March, 1921), all troops and labour surplus to the datum garrison of thirty-three battalions should be clear by the 31st- May next. This calculation allows no margin for unforeseen details, nor does it take into account further reductions of non-combatants consequent upon the withdrawal of the above troops; this assumes that eight out of the fourteen battalions under orders for relief are not relieved from India. In addition to the above numbers, there are ten battalions and other troops which it has now been decided are to leave the country. These, with the Ancillary Services which can go concurrently, amount to approxi-mately 15,000. Their embarkation should commence, on the assumption as to shipping made above, by the 1st June, and at 5,000 per week should be clear by the 21st June.In the figure 15,000 given above, some 12,000 are combatants and 3,000 non-combatants; these 3,000 represent only a small proportion of the Ancillary Services, which are mainly transport, river and land. These latter are required to effect the withdrawal of the combatant troops, and as soon as completed their reduction will follow rapidly in corresponding proportion.3. The draft telegram to the War Office deals with the roster of units to be evacuated, which can only be settled between the War Office and the Government of India,4. A draft telegram from the Secretary of State to the Secretary of State for War is attached.5. The saving in the next financial year is estimated to be approximately five and a half millions.6. The surplus horses for Mesopotamia can only be dealt with in the following ways:-r-(a.) Officers to be allowed to purchase.(&amp;.) As many animals as possible to be disposed of by local sales.(c.) Animals in veterinary hospitals to be destroyed.(d.) All animals not fit for six months&apos; hard work to be destroyed.A telegram to Mesopotamia giving instructions as above should be sent at once.Horses which are surplus after the reductions which follow and the action proposed above can only be disposed of by destruction if the War Office do not require them elsewhere. In the draft telegram attached the War Office has been asked for an immediate answer on this point.Appendix 9.SUGGESTED PROGRAMME AND TIME-TABLE FOR MESOPOTAMIA.1.

6. Sherif Faisal would have arranged to arrive at Mecca about the same date. He would after about a week, say on the 23rd&apos;, telegraph to Nuri, Ja&apos;afar and any other influential friends of his, saying that, having been repeatedly urged by his friends to come to Mesopotamia, and the British Govern-ment, in reply to his enquiries, having informed him that if the people of Mesopotamia wanted him they were not disposed to stand in his way, he had discussed the matter with his father and brothers and had decided to offer his services to Irak. That he was writing more fully the plat-form on which he was prepared to stand, but that he was prepared to accept the terms of the mandate as laid before the League of Nations, provided that the British Govern-ment would agree to an additional clause making it possible that, by understanding between the parties, the terms of the mandate could be modified at any time after the passing of the law of the Constitution and its approval by the League of Nations, into the form of a treaty, providing , on the one hand for the continuance of the help and support of the mandatory, and on the other for the adequate safe- *guarding and maintenance of the latter&apos;s special interests and privileged position in Irak.He would also send tactful telegrams to Naqib and Saiyid Talib, saying that he hoped he would have their support and personal participation in the Government of the country ...        ...        ... &apos;       ...        ...   April 23.  Sat.7. Having seen the primary effect of this from his friends, Faisal would send a representative, or come himself, to Mesopo-tamia during Ramadan       ...        ...        ...        ...   May 8 to June 88. It is expected that Faisal&apos;s announcement, followed by his arrival in the country, would result in such a definite expression of public feeling on his behalf as would make it unnecessary for us to ask the Congress to discuss the question of tne ruler; they would simply confirm directly or indirectly his nomination.9. Having done this, Faisal would dissolve the present Provisional Government, i.e., the Council of Ministers, and call the Naqib, or someone else, to form a Cabinet.Appendix 10. Kurdistan.FOURTH MEETING OF THE POLITICAL COMMITTEE.March 15, 1921. Present:The Rt. Hon. Winston Spencer Churchill, P.C., M.P. (Chairman).Sir Percy Cox, G.C.I.E., K.C.S.I.Miss Gertrude Bell, C.B.E.Colonel T. E. Lawrence.Major H. W. Young, D.S.O.Major Noel (Consultative Member).Major R. D. Badcock, M.C. (Secretary).The Committee proceeded to discuss the question of Kurdistan.The position was reviewed in the light of the revision of the Treaty of Sevres, and it was suggested that the southern Kurds should not be included under the Government of Iraq. Sir Percy Cox stated that he had already intimated to his Council of State that during the year within which Kurdistan had the right under the treaty to opt for independence he would deal with Kurdish districts himself, and [6117] K
that at the end of that period the position would have to be reconsidered in the light of future developments. He had already received a protest from the Council against this decision. The area in which the Kurds were predominant was in the divisions of Kirkuk and Sulimanieh and certain districts north of Mosul. Kirkuk and Mosul were now administered by Mutesarrifs, advised by British Political Officers, and with a staff of Kurdish officials, of whom there was a plentiful supply. Fattah Pasha, a Turk whom the Kurds regarded with favour, had been appointed Mutessarrif of Kirkuk. Sir Percy Cox was of opinion that these divisions formed an integral part of Iraq, whilst economically they should undoubtedly belong to that country. He agreed with Miss Bell that the people of Kirkuk would wish to take part in the forthcoming election, and that their representatives should sit in the Iraq Parliament. He doubted whether the people of Sulimanieh would hold the same view. At any rate, he considered that they should be given an opportunity of co-operating if they so desired.Major Young pointed out that if they were to wait for the elections it would be some time before they would be able to give a definite expression of their wishes for the future. He suggested that it might be preferable not to delay, but to set up a Kurdish State which would be directly under the control of the High Commissioner, and would not be a part of, or responsible to, the Iraq Government.In reply to a question by the Chairman, Major Noel stated that the Kurds considered that they had been given what they had hoped for under the Treaty of Sevres. The Turks had not used the Kurds against us. but, now that the British forces were evacuating this area, he considered that the Turks might attempt to detach Sulimanieh from the zone of our influence. He thought that the Kurds would prefer Home Pule, and that they would demur to accepting any responsibility to the Iraq Government, especially if Turkish propaganda were used to intensify their objections to being placed under an Arab State. He considered that British policy demanded the setting up of a Kurdish buffer State which could be used to counter-balance any strong anti-British movement which might occur in Mesopotamia. He suggested that if there were no customs barrier between the two countries, the Kurds should be given a fair portion of the revenue.Major &apos; Young pointed out that the position was somewhat similar to that between Palestine and Trans-Jordania, where the latter had been given a form of local autonomy and the preservation of the rights of communities. He thought that it was desirable to keep the Kurds under our control, and he did not agree to an entirely separate Kurdish State which would not be responsible to the British Government.In reply to a question by the Chairman, Colonel Lawrence stated that it was his opinion that the Kurds should not be placed under an Arab&quot; Government, although he fully realised that the latter would endeavour to arrange this. He did not consider it desirable that there should be two Mutesarrifs in the area, and suggested that one should be appointed, though he should not necessarily be given the position of a Kurdish prince.Miss Bell did not agree with the suggestion that one Mutesarrif should be appointed for the two divisions. She suggested that the whole position should be left for a further period of about six months, after which she was of the opinion that the Kurds would be anxious to join the Iraq Government.Major Young suggested that possibly the present time was opportune, as the machinery had already been provided for the election, to arrange that the Kurds held a separate election for a Council for their own divisions. He thought that it was unnecessary to send Arab levies or British troops to this area, and that security might be maintained by the formation of a special Kurdish force.The Chairman was inclined to agree with the suggestion, and he put forward that it might be possible to subsidise a Kurdish chief and his more influential subordinates and to grant provisional trading facilities in consideration of an agree-ment that they would prevent the Turks from carrying out a policy in that area adverse to British interests in Iraq. Even if the Kurds wished to join in the elections, he anticipated difficulty if they were included in Iraq. A Sherif, whose breeding and family history probably led him to hold views on the Divine Right of Kings, might, while outwardly accepting constitutional procedure and forming a Parliament, at the same time despise democratic and constitutional methods. If this
were so, it might well be that, with the power of an Arab army behind him, he would ignore Kurdish sentiment and oppress the Kurdish minority. British policy would, on the other hand, be well secured by a friendly buffer State between Iraq and the Turks.Sir Percy Cox stated that the revenue from the divisions of Kirkuk and Sulimanieh did not pay for the administration of those areas, and Major Young observed that they would therefore be no loss to Mesopotamia, Sir Percy Cox was, nevertheless, inclined to think that it would be better, as he had already done some-thing in the direction of separate treatment for Kurdistan, to allow matters to take their course, in the hope of an ultimate fusion with Iraq.Replying to a question by the Chairman, Major Noel said that, if he were asked to draw a frontier between a proposed Kurdish province and Iraq, it would be roughly along the line of the foothills. He enquired whether any provision had been made for the future of Amadia under the revised Treaty of Sevres, and thought that it should be included in the British zone.The Chairman pointed out that there was a close analogy between the functions of the Governor-General of South Africa, in respect of the Union of South Africa and Rhodesia, and those now suggested for the High Commissioner in respect of Mesopotamia and Kurdistan. He felt that British policy was giving very great support to the Arab cause, and that it could not overlook the rights of the Kurdish minority. He suggested that it might be possible to form two Kurdish regiments, which he understood could easily be raised, to hold the divisions of Sulimanieh and Kirkuk. He trusted that, under the influence of the High Commissioner, who would superintend the affairs of the two countries, through entirely distinct and separate channels, Kurdistan and Iraq would be drawn closer together, and that they might form one State in the future. He thought that it was possible for the meeting to come to a definite &quot;decision on this matter, as there was no need to refer it to the Foreign Office, or to any other quarter, though it might have ultimately to be referred to the League of Nations.In reply to a question by the Chairman, Miss Bell stated that she considered that Mosul should undoubtedly be included in Iraq. The Chairman agreed with Major Young that it might be possible to form something in the nature of a frontier force of Kurds, under the command of British officers, and he suggested that this question should be referred to the Sub-Committee formed under the presidency of Major-General Ironside, with whom Major Noel might discuss the matter before his departure.Appendix 11. Arab Army and Levies.EXTRACT FROM MINUTES OF SIXTH MEETING OF COMBINED POLITICAL AND MILITARY COMMITTEE.March 19, 1921.(For remainder of Minutes and Composition of Committee, see Appendix 13.)The Chair mam, then passed on to the question of the levies in Mesopotamia. He pointed out that, in principle, the High Commissioner should bear in mind that in the future the Iraq Government should be prepared to pay a certain contribution towards the maintenance of British troops stationed in Mesopotamia. He quite realised that it would be impossible for this to be done for perhaps three or four years., during which time the surplus revenue of the country would be utilised in forming an Arab army. This should, in itself, provide a considerable relief to the Imperial garrison, but it would be well that every effort should be made to encourage the Council of State to adopt the principle of increasing contributions proportionate to the revenue of the country.The High Commissioner remarked that the Arab army would cost 85 lakhs per f annum. He agreed.with the Chairman that it was important for a contribution to be[6117] &apos; v K 2
62*made in the near future, and undertook to bear in mind that His Majesty&apos;s Government would ultimately expect the acceptance of this principle.The Chairman considered that it would be well that not only a larger proportion of British officers but also a stiffening of British N.C.O&apos;s. should be included in the levy corps. He felt that it had been a mistake to have so small a proportion of British officers in the Indian army. He was aware that the language was a difficulty, but he thought that the right type of man could quickly pick it up.It was generally agreed that the new levies corps should not be under the control of the Arab Government, but of the High Commissioner, through the General Officer Commanding.Sir Percy Cose suggested that it would be well for General Ironside to enquire into the formation of the Kurdish force on his arrival in Mesopotamia.In reply to the Chairman, General Ironside stated that he was prepared to take on anything for which he received an order.General Haldane suggested that in the meanwhile, as it was of vital importance that the relief of British troops in Southern Kurdistan should be effected as early as possible, instructions should he given for the raising of the levies to be proceeded with immediately.In reply to the chairman, J a&apos;afar Pasha stated that he was quite content with the suggestions made in the report, and fully agreed to the recommendations of the Committee. He was convinced that he would have no difficulty in raising the necessary number of troops.The recommendations of the Sub-Committee were then accepted.Proceedings of a Sub-Committee to Discuss the Question of a National Army in Iraq in accordance with the Agenda attached.Present:President *&apos; Sir P. Z. Cox, G.C.I.E., K.C.S.I., K.C.M.G.Members:Major-General Sir E. Ironside, K.C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O. Major-General Ja&apos;afar Pasha, C.M.G. Major Young, D.S.O. Major J. I. Eadie, D.S.O.1. Colonel Moens&apos; scheme was read and discussed, and the Committee considered it sound and should be accepted in principle. The Committee consider that the formation of an Iraq army is a matter of vital importance, and that every endeavour should be made to facilitate its raising and aid its efficiency.3a&apos;afar Pasha states that, in order to enable him to recruit quickly, it will be necessary that the levies should not recruit from the townsmen and settled villagers of Iraq. Also that the army must get the same pay as the levies, and the conditions of service in the latter must not be better than in the former.The Committee emphasise the importance of the co-operation of G.H.Q. in the provision of all military necessaries.It is recognised that it may prove expedient and also be preferred by the Ministry of Defence that they should first take over the Hillah-Nasiriyah. line instead of Kirkuk. This should be considered when the time comes in consultation with the G.O.C.-in-Chief.2. The Committee consider that any Kurdish or other units raised should be raised under British officers on the existing levy- lines, and distributed for the maintenance of security in other than Arab areas. The scale must be adjusted in accordance with the military requirements necessary for the taking over the areas. This is being considered now.The Committee recommend that the existing non-Arab elements in the levies should be transferred to this new frontier force as soon as the High Commissioner can conveniently arrange it.  If this can be arranged, Ja&apos;afar Pasha agrees to the x deficiency being made good by the enlistment of Arabs.  The numbers involved at present would amount to about 500.
Agenda for Discussion by Sir P. Cox and General Ironside and theirSub-Committee.1. To examine the proposals of the Baghdad Committee presided over by Colonel Moens (which formulated a scheme for raising a nucleus army officered entirely by Arab officers with British inspectors of 5,000 men to be recruited within a year from date of permission being given to start recruiting), and consider in consultation with Ja&apos;afar Pasha what modifications will be necessary, or are desired by him, in order to speed up the scheme sufficiently to enable him to take over the Kirkuk area by the 1st October, 1921, instead of by the 1st April, 1922.2. In the course of the Fourth Meeting of the Political Committee of the 15th March it was agreed that &quot;it might be possible to form something in the nature of a frontier force of Kurds under the command of British officers,&quot; and the Chairman desired that this Sub-Committee should develop the idea and formulate for the consideration of the Conference the lines and scale on which the force should be organised.3- It being accepted that these levies will have to be run and commanded by British officers pending transfer of their functions to the Arab army of the future. In these circumstances the National Government (which will have no control over them) cannot be called upon to maintain them! Indeed, they are not in a position to do so on their budget. Consequently, they will have to be financed, for the present at any rate, by His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Sub-Committee will accordingly frame data on which the financial representative of the War Office can estimate the sum which it will be necessary to provide for them in his financial appreciation.4. Always with the reservation that it entirely depends on the removal of Turkish hostility and menace from the north as result of recent London Conference, the High Commissioner has undertaken to accept the withdrawal of the existing British detachments from four Mosul outposts and to replace them by levies. The Sub-Committee will discuss this question and suggest the best course to pursue to effect the purpose in view.Temporary Kurd and Arab Levies in Mesopotamia, Opficered byBritish Officers.Note prepared, for the approval of the Secretary of State, on the 19th March, by a Sub-Committee, consisting of : Mr.&apos; -Crosland. Colonel Frith. Colonel Slater. Major Young.On the return of Sir Percy Cox to Mesopotamia, the existing Arab levies will be removed from the control of the Ministry of the Interior and placed under the command of the G.O.C.-in-C.  This transfer of command will not, however, involve3. The Committee recognise that, on the basis at present contemplated, i.e., as a force controlled by British officers and working under the High Commissioner, it cannot appear in the budget of the National Government as a Mesopotamian commitment. They consider that it should be financed in the first place by Imperial funds, the National Government making such contribution as they are in a position to do without prejudice to the progress of the National army on the lines recom-mended in paragraph 1. It is suggested that the financial aspect be discussed by the Financial Adviser to the High Commissioner in consultation with the Treasury and War Office representatives.4. The High Commissioner has received a telegram from the Political Officer, Mosul stating that the menace from Turkey has by no means ceased to exist, and he contemplated with grave concern the withdrawal of the Mosul-British outposts in two months&apos; time as contemplated. The Committee consider that by far the best course is that a senior officer should be specially deputed to proceed at once to Mosul and study and report on the situation and the best means of effecting the object in view.
the transfer to the G.O.C.-in-C. of the responsibility for the administration and accounting for the levies, which will remain, as at present, with the High Commissioner.Similarly the Kurdish and Assyrian units to be raised will be under the command of the G.O.C.-in-C, but will be administered by the High Commissioner, through the officer commanding the levies or otherwise.The charge, which is to be borne in the first instance by the Colonial Office Vote, with some contribution from local revenues, will be submitted by the High Com-missioner to the Colonial Office, for purposes of estimates and accounts, and there is no reason for it to pass through the books of the War Office, as will the charge for British and Indian troops in Mesopotamia borne.by the Colonial Office Vote, though the War Office should of course be ready to aid the Secretary of State for the Colonies with any military or financial advice he may require with regard to these levies.Proceedings of the Second Sitting of Sir P.

With reference to the new Levy Force the Committee consider that very little expenditure in the direction of building barracks will be necessary, provided that any Turkish military buildings at places to be held by levies under this scheme, and now in occupation of our troops, will be handed over as soon as possible.2. The Committee estimate that the new force will amount to about 5,000. For these are required 30 British officers and 15 British N.C.O.&apos;s.The cost of this force is estimated at about 70 lakhs for a year. - At the same time the existing force of 2,500 will be amalgamated with the above force and their budget transferred to Imperial Exchequer at an estimated cost of 40 lakhs.Total cost falling on Imperial funds for this levy force would thus be 70 plus 40, i.e., 110 lakhs, or say 750,000Z., replacing a British force costing far more.Present:March 19, 1921.(Signed)P. z.

To consider Table III (see Appendix 7), and to endeavour to apply it place by place to the existing situation with a view to aiding the Civil Administration to the utmost, without incurring undue military risk.1. The garrisons considered necessary by Lieutenant-General Haldahe were gone into place by place, and after considerable discussion were actually placed as follows with the approbation of Sir Percy Cox: Mosul 2 battalions infantry. 1 regiment cavalry. 1 field battery. 1 pack battery.Lines of Communication, Mosul to Baghdad 3 battalions infantry. 1 battery field artillery. 1 pack battery.Baghdad-Garrison and local defence, 2 battalions.Outposts Hillah, 1 company.

Kirkuk    .3 battalions infantry. 2 squadrons cavalry. 1 pack battery.Nasiriya 1 battalion infantry.Shaiba 1 battalion infantry.2. As Sir Percy Cox considers he can place Arab levies in the Mosul northern outposts in two months&apos; time, the garrison was reduced by 2 battalions.3. The question of placing six months&apos; supplies in Mosul in order to withdraw the L. of C. troops (3 battalions), and with them find the garrison for Kirkuk was considered and rejected as being unsound from a military point of view.&apos; 4. The proposal to find garrisons for Kirkuk, Nasiriya and Shaiba by abolishing the mobile column of Baghdad was considered and rejected owing to its leaving the Baghdad and Persian outposts beyond reach of support, as the Air-Marshal considered he was not yet in a position to maintain both outpost lines, but was prepared to maintain the Baghdad outposts during the absence of the mobile column. At the same time the Air-Marshal stated that he was prepared to replace punitive columns by aircraft, and his Excellency Sir Percy Cox considered that he would be satisfied with such action.5. The garrison required for Kirkuk (3 battalions, 2 squadrons, 1 pack battery), for Nasiriya (1 battalion) and for Shaiba (1 battalion), have been obtained by reduction of the Mosul outposts (2 battalions), the L. of C. to the Baghdad Mobile Column (2 battalions), and the addition of 1 battalion of infantry to the original Table III estimate. To summarise: The proposals involve the addition of 1 battalion of Indian infantry and the reduction of 1 battery field artillery. An amended table is attached.6. The question of the formation of an Arab army was raised, and Sir Percy Cox stated that for the time being nothing can be looked for beyond voluntary enlisted troops and levies.Modified Table showing Proposed Distribution of Troops on Reduction to twenty-three Battalion Basis.Place.;	Infantry Battalions.

FOURTH MEETING OF THE MILITARY COMMIT!!&apos;;:.March 15, 1921.President:Lieutenant-General Sir W. Congreve.Members:Sir Percy Cox. Air-Marshal Trenchard. Lieutenant-General Haldane. Major-General Radcliffe. Major-General Atkinson. Wing-Commander Burnett. Ja&apos;afar Pasha.&apos; Secretary: . /Lieutenant-Colonel Waters Taylor.1. Major H. W. Young, joins as a Member of the Committee.2. In reply to the President, Ja&apos;afar Pasha stated that if he started recruiting on the 1st April, he would undertake to have 4,000 troops of the Arab army prepared to take over the Kirkuk area on the 1st October. Ja&apos;afar Pasha to carry out his undertaking, made the following conditions: (a) that he is to be given the entire use of the towns and settled villages as his recruiting field; (b) that the levies should be drawn from the tribes, Nestorians, Lauristan Kurds and others outside the Irak population proper; and (c) that the Arab army should be on an equal footing to the levies as regards pay and allowances. i3. Sir Percy Cox agreed in principle to Ja&apos;afar Pasha&apos;s proposals, and under-took to do his utmost to assist in their execution, and they were considered and accepted by the Committee.4. The President here informed Ja&apos;afar Pasha that he would detain him no longer as he had supplied all the information desired from him by the Committee. Ja&apos;afar Pasha withdrew.5. The President here read to the Committee the Secretary of State&apos;s minute. Sir Percy Cox said he felt that he must state that in his opinion there was undoubted possibility that the methods pursued to establish a friendly Kurdistan might result in an unfriendly Irak, and that this point of view ought to be taken into consideration in the question of the internal security of Irak.6. The G.O.C.-in-C. Mesopotamia hands in a table of Provisional Proposals for the further reduction in the army of occupation to 16 battalions and subsequently to 12 battalions, on or after the 1st October, as the responsibilities of the Imperial Forces are assumed by the Local Forces (table attached). There will be a pro-portionate reduction in the ancillary services, 2 divisional generals and 2 brigadiers and staffs disappear on the 23 battalion scheme coming into operation, leaving 4 brigade commanders. The reduction in the senior commands and staffs continues side by side with the reduction in troops.7. The Committee recommend a further substantial reduction of the Kirkuk garrison as early as the political situation permits, and this reduction might under favourable conditions take place before the relief of the Imperial forces by local forces in the Kirkuk area. The reduced garrison being supported by air action by the air forces now available in the country.8. The Committee recommends the addition of a Vickers Vimy Squadron supplemented by one or two armoured car companies when the Mosul area is given up by the Imperial forces. This squadron could be found from Egypt, and would fly to Mesopotamia by the desert route. The arrival in Mesopotamia of this squadron in December would mean a charge on the Mesopotamian vote of 100,000Z. (one hundred thousand pounds) approximately in the financial year 1921-22. The annual recurring expenditure of a Vickers Vimy Squadron being 200,0O0Z. (two hundred and twenty thousand pounds).9. The Committee accept the C.O.C.&apos;s provisional proposalsfor areduction to the twelve battalions basis on or after October 1921. Sir Percy Cox accepting on the understanding, that he proceeds with the recruiting of levies under British officers, and that when the expenditure thus incurred exceeds his budgetary provision, the deficit will be met from Imperial funds.&apos; [6117] L

Note by the Secretary of State for Consideration of the Joint Military andPolitical Committee this Afternoon.The savings resulting from the immediate reductions now arranged are only estimated by Mr. Crosland to amount to 5 millions. This is quite insufficient. It is, therefore, indispensable to consider now the second stage of reduction this year. This stage will begin on the 1st October, assuming that a further review of the situation in September renders it possible. Whereas the first stage of reduction will be presented by the Secretary of State to Parliament as a definite fact, the second will only be mentioned as a contingent and hoped-for possibility. In that sense, however, and subject to that reserve, the economies resulting from the second stage will be aggregated with those resulting from the first.The Joint Committee is desired to prepare the second stage, specifying units, arms, administrative services, civil personnel, animals, &amp;c. In other words, covering the whole ground previously covered by the first stage. In principle, .the object should be to secure a further saving, if all goes well, of 3 millions in the financial year 1921-22.  For this purpose certain assumptions may be made : 1 1. Ample shipping will be available from the zero day to convey the troops and followers from the country at the maximum rate which the communica-tions can deliver them at the port. Consideration must be given to. the fact that communications, especially by railway, will on the favourable hypothesis have been Improved by then.2. The improvement and development of local forces capable of relieving the garrisons in definite areas. No sentimental or local considerations must stand in the way of the preparation of these forces in an efficient condi-tion by the most expeditious means that can be devised. This need is paramount and must have priority over other considerations, The detailed examination of this policy will be resumed by General Ironside&apos;s Sub-Committee when an agreement has been reached on principles by the Political Committee.3. Kurdistan. The Committee should assume that arrangements will be made in regard to Kurdistan, which will secure the general goodwill of its inhabitants, although no final decision has been taken by the Political Committee, they have viewed with favour the following plan: Mandatory Kurdistan to be administered directly under the High Commissioner, probably through a local Council or Kurdish chiefs, managing their interior affairs and enjoying a subsidy and other forms of support in consideration for guarding the marches of Mesopotamia from unfriendly intruders and opening the country for trade and encouraging recruitment for Imperial purposes. A force of Kurdish levies to be raised by companies under British officers and non-commis-sioned officers (one of each to the company). These troops to be ready by the 1st October to relieve the present garrisons of Kirkuk and Mosul. As a development of the above, companies of Assyrians to be raised, if possible, and employed as may be found suitable in association with the Kurds. In principle, therefore, the arrangement for Kurdistan will be similar to that which prevails in South Africa, where the High Commis-sioner stands in one relation to the responsible Government of the Union and at the same time has a direct executive authority over Rhodesia and certain native territories. It is not intended to offend the Kurds by putting them under the Arabs either in principle or locally, but, on the other hand, to secure Kurdish forces which can within the six months relieve us,in the districts specified.Proceeding on these lines, it is to be hoped that a further ten or eleven battalions, with a full proportion of other arms, can begin to leave Mesopotamia on zero day after the 1st October; and Mr. Crosland should calculate the effect on the finances of the year 1921-22 of such a further reduction if it took place on the 1st October or on the 1st January.In all cases the co-operation of the air in conjunction with local levies should be developed to the fullest possible extent.- March 15, 1921.[6117]

Somerset. ,Miss Gertrude Bell, C.B.E. Major Eadie.Wing-Commander E. L. Gossage, D.S.O., M.C. Captain F. G. Peake.R. D. Badcock, M.C. (Secretary).The Committee had before them the report (Annexure I) of the Military Com-mittee under the presidency of Lieutenant-Gemeral Sir Walter Congreve, assembled to enquire into the scheme (Annexure 2) submitted by Air-Marshal Sir H. M. Trenchard, for the defence of Mesopotamia by the Royal Air Force, in conjunction with local forces.The Chairman briefly reviewed the report, and presumed that the recommendations  -tions of the Air-Marshal would provide for the protection of the High Commissioner at Baghdad, as well as for a garrison at Amara. He enquired whether there were cantonments at Amara at the present time. General Haldane replied that there were only a few mud huts and temporary structures, which had been utilised by the army during the War. The reason for his&apos;recommendation that the garrison should be stationed at Amara rather than at Baghdad was that in the event of hostile action by the people of Mesopotamia, there would be 300 miles less of lines of communica-tion to guard. He pointed out that in considering this matter, he had to provide for the least favourable contingency, and to assume that the local populace, which was fully armed, was hostile. Reasons of health was another argument in favour of Amara, which, although as hot as Baghdad, was more healthy. General Congreve submitted that Amara was well placed to protect the oil fields, and that it could be used as a base, from which we could more readily reinforce the army in India should it be necessary to do so.The Air-Marshal stated that under his scheme he would have approximately 1,800 men stationed in Baghdad. He did not anticipate that it would ever be neces-sary to remove this force by air, as he thought it would be able to hold out until relief arrived, in the event of a general hostile rising.The Chairman was not entirely in agreement with the General Officer Command-ing in his recommendation. He thought that if the force were ever cut off, it would oe better if they were concentrated in Baghdad.    He thought that it would be
possible to overcome the difficulties of protecting the additional length of lines of communication. The troops would also be able to enjoy amenities such as electric light, good water supply, more efficient hospitals and improved conditions of recreational-tion in Baghdad to an extent that would be impossible in Amara.General Haldane stated that the difficulty of protecting troops moving up and down the river arose from the danger of their&apos;being fired at from the river banks, which rose 20 feet above the narrow channel of the stream. None of the boats which he now had were bullet proof. It would be impossible to embark troops upon the gunboats, though he thought it would be necessary to retain these if it were decided that the river line of communication should be kept open.The Chairman suggested that it would be possible to keep the bank clear of snipers by erecting some kind of platform on the vessels, on the top of which could be placed machine guns, which could sweep the banks and keep them clear of the enemy. General Haldane replied that during the operations time had not permitted of such an experiment being made, but he thought that it might be possible to arrange something of this nature, though it would need careful consideration owing to the shallow draft of the boats, which might be inclined to capsize- if the super-structure were too high.In reply to the Chairman, General Radcliffe stated that although he had not had an opportunity of consulting him, he felt sure that the C.I.G.S. would not agree to keep a military force in Baghdad which could not be moved by air, and whose communications were not guarded by British troops.General Haldane, Colonel Frith and Mr. Crosland agreed that it would be more expensive if the troops were stationed at Baghdad, owing to the additional cost of labour and communication service.The Chairman felt that the scheme was open to grave risks, as, if there were a concerted action against the British in Baghdad, it would be impossible for the aeroplanes to operate, as the,aerodromes and depots would be liable to attack.The Air-Marshal stated that if there were no serious risk owing to the extended lines of communication, he would prefer to have the troops stationed in Baghdad concentrated with the Air Force, and he ventured to remind the Chairman that although he had not assumed that the entire Arab army and populace would be hostile to us, he had also a force of armoured cars, which would be utilised to protect the aerodromes and depots, from which the aeroplanes would operate. The Air-Marshal stated that if it were decided to carry out his proposition it would involve an additional expenditure this year amounting, if it was necessary for him to be ready in May or June next year, to approximately 320,000/. for new machines and additional personnel, made up of 200,000/. for personnel, &amp;c, and 120,000/. for Vickers Vimy machines; this is, provided the Army can assist us with additional personnel when the Air assumes responsibility next year; but if the Army were unable to assist us with personnel, it would necessitate our spending at least 500,000/. this year additional. Even then it is doubtful if we could get the additional personnel or accommodate them in time.The Chairman stated that he anticipated it would not be difficult to obtain this extra vote, especially as such a small amount had been allowed for commercial aviation. He was inclined&apos;to think that if His Majesty&apos;s Government ran the risk of losing 1,800 men with very costly stores and machines, the risk would not be very much more serious if an additional 3,000 men were garrisoned with them at Baghdad, while this extra force might be strong enough to prevent the commencement of hostilities on a large scale in the first place. Assuming the worst aspect, it would be necessary to send an expedition to relieve either the 1,800 men of the Air Force or the garrison, if the latter were stationed at Baghdad, and he felt that he must ask that stronger arguments be given him before he could accept the Amara proposal. An alternative might be the provision of a British force of constabulary, which he had mentioned at a previous meeting. He asked that the Sub-Committee should again meet and formulate further proposals.
SIXTH MEETING OF THE COMBINED POLITICAL AND military committee.March 19, 1921.Present:The Rt. Hon. Winston Churchill, M.P. (Chairman). Sir Percy Cox, G.C.I.E., K.C.S.I.Lieutenant-General Sir J. A. L. Haldane, K.C.B., D.S.O. Lieutenant-General Sir Walter Congreve, V.C., K.C.B. (Chairman of theMilitary Committee), General Sir&quot;P. P. de B. Radcliffe, K.C.M.G., &amp;c. Air Vice-Marshal Sir G.

(Secretary).The Chairman read the report (Annexure 3) of the Sub-Committee reassembled to enquire into and advise on the formation of the Defence Force in Mesopotamia, and to make recommendations as to the most suitable station for the garrison in the event of the proposal of the Air-Marshal for the defence of Mesopotamia being accepted. It was decided to add to the report that Amara was capable of being made a more popular station by the planting of trees and by laying out a suitable station.The Chairman reserved his opinion on the comparative merits of Baghdad and Amara. He pointed out that it would be impossible to make any definite decision, certainly before one year, and perhaps before two, as it would be impossible to decide upon the extent of the permanent garrison until then. He suggested that the General Officer Commanding should nevertheless enquire into the scheme, on the spot on his return, in order that alternative proposals might be formulated for consideration when the time came.Annexure 1 to Appendix 13.MINUTES OF THE THIRD MEETING OF THE JOINT POLITICAL ANDMILITARY COMMITTEE.Assembled at 11-30, March 16, 1921.President:Lieutenant-General Sir W. Congreve.Members:Sir Percy Cox. Air-Marshal Trenchard. Lieutenant-General Haldane. Major-General Radcliffe. Major-General Atkinson. Wing Commander Burnett.Secretary:Lieutenant-Colonel Waters-Taylor. Major Young (absent).1. The minutes of the previous meeting are read and amended. 2. The C.A.S.&apos;s scheme for the control of Mesopotamia was considered by the Committee.
3. C.A.S. agreed to substitute in bis scheme the term local forces for Arab army whenever the latter expression occurs.4. C.A.S. agreed to amend sub-paragraph (d) of paragraph 1 to read as follows: &apos;&apos; Every effort will be made to reduce the numbers of small garrisons distributed throughout the area.&quot;5. The question of a site for the Baghdad Air Base on the W. or the S.W. of Baghdad was discussed and the Committee decided that the advantages of the Hinaidi site outweigh any possible advantages of the W. or S.W. ones, as light and water services are installed at Hinaidi and a considerable expenditure has already been made on the erection of permanent and semi-permanent buildings and the provision of roads.6. The Committee recommend that the L.A. Car Companies should be under the control of the R.A.F., both for purposes of unity of command and economy in upkeep, the resources of the repair shops for R.A.F. and armoured cars thus being pooled. The Committee recognise that a principle requiring War Office decision is involved, hut recommend, pending a final decision as to policy, the retention in Mesopotamia of all armoured cars and personnel.An urgent decision is necessary to enable the R.A.F. to recruit and train sufficient armoured car personnel to be able to function when the C.A.S. scheme comes into operation, estimated to be about April 1922.7. The Committee recommend also that the river gun boats and armoured (or protected) trains should be taken over by the R.A.F. The armoured trains in Mesopotamia have proved of small value owing to the ease with which they are isolated by tearing up the rail; several have been lost in this way. The Committee suggest, as worth of consideration, the means adopted by armoured trains in Poland to meet such tactics. The Polish trains carried with them Renault light tanks, capable of embarking the train crews and of driving off attackers and ensuring the recovery of the train.8. The Committee recommended that when the C.A.S. scheme comes into operation, the Imperial forces to be retained in Mesopotamia should be on the strength of 1 brigade plus 1 pack battery. The force to be located as follows: H.Q.&apos;s 3 battalions less 1 company, 1 pack battery at Amara, 1 battalion at Basra, 1 company at Baghdad as High Commissioner^ bodyguard. The Committee have selected Amara, as the garrison there is at the strategic point which covers the oil-fields, its communications are secure and it. is the healthiest spot obtainable. The force would not be mobile, and, in the event of grave emergency, reinforcements would have to be found from elsewhere.9. The Committee accept in principle the C.A.S.&apos;s scheme. The Committee explored alternate avenues, but came to the conclusion that the only means by which a reduction from the twelve battalion to the four battalion scheme could be effected was by the measures set forth in the C.A.S.&apos;s scheme.10. The Committee are most strongly of the opinion that an efficient centralised Intelligence Department is essential to the success of the C.A.S.&apos;s scheme.11. The Committee have requested Mr. Crosland of the War Office to prepare a statement showing comparative costs of (a) 12 battalions infantry, 1 cavalry regiment, 1 field battery, 1 pack battery, 1 S. and M. company, plus 6 squadrons R.A.F., plus local forces; (t) 1 brigade of infantry and ,1 pack battery, plus the forces set forth in the C.A.S.&apos;s scheme, plus.the local forces.v The Committee are most strongly of the opinion that, in calculating the advan- &apos; tages of these two proposals, consideration should be given to the vital necessity of preparing and training an Air Force adequate to our needs in war, the importance of testing the potentialities of the Air Force, the need for giving its superior officers and staffs the experience in independent command and responsibility, and the provision of an &quot;All Red&quot; military and commercial air route to India.12. The Committee point out that, to bring the C.A.S.&apos;s scheme into operation by April 1922, it is necessary to order the construction of a Vickers-Vimy squadron at once, as it will require one year from the date of the receipt of the order to complete.
Annexure 2 to Appendix 13. Scheme for the Control of Mesopotamia by Royal Air Force.1, Political State of the Country.In formulating the following scheme the assumptions mentioned hereunder have been taken : (a.) As a result of the selection of an Arab ruler satisfactory to the country, the country is free from organised rebellion, but is liable to ordinary spasmodic disturbances in districts that take place.(&amp;.) Political indications may be regarded as not pointing to the imminence of external attack from Turkish or Bolshevik sources.(c) The functions of such garrisons of Arab troops as exist, will be merely tomaintain order in the immediate vicinity of the stations, which are enumerated hereunder.(d) The necessity for keeping small garrisons distributed throughout thecountry for the purposes of collecting taxes need not be considered.(e) If any British troops are kept in the country they are stationed at a suitablehealth resort as a reserve for a great emergency, and not for the running of the country.2. Location of Main Base.Bearing the above assumptions in mind, it is considered that Mesopotamia can be efficiently controlled by an Arab army assisted by the Royal Air Porce and armoured cars, the two latter forces operating from not more than three main bases. Although, the actual places can only -be decided upon by local consideration on the spot, it would appear that three main, bases can be located in or about the following places: (i.) Baghdad. (Or Pelujah or some spot S.W. of Baghdad on the edge of the desert.) This should be the largest station capable of holding six squadrons in normal conditions to be increased by two more in an emergency. Here also will be located a portion of the repair depot and armoured cars repair depot designed to maintain those squadrons. Barracks and shed accommodation will have to be provided on the most economical scale that is possible without losing efficiency.(ii.) Basra or Shaibah. At this station there will be accommodation sufficient&apos; to hold two squadrons, but capable of taking four squadrons in an emergency. A large portion of the depots enumerated in (i) will also be accommodated here. The barrack accommodation here will not be for more than the personnel of two squadrons, and the added depot personnel.(iii.) Shergat or Mosid-This station need not always necessarily be occupied by aircraft and their personnel. It is intended only that two squadrons should be located here when required. The hangar and barrack accommodation will not be as efficient or complete as that mentioned in (i) and (ii), as the station will not necessarily be always occupied.3. Auxiliary Aerodromes and Landing Grounds.A certain number of aerodromes and landing grounds should be selected at various points throughout the country with due regard to political and military considerations. These aerodromes and landing grounds may be roughly classified into two types (A) and (B).Classification (A). 1 &apos;These aerodromes should be capable of taking a complete squadron under war time conditions. They would be guarded by detachments of the Arab army only, and should only he located at places where detachments of the Arab army are likely to be maintained. A certain amount of petrol and oil and spares sufficient to maintain a squadron for six days or thereabouts should be kept, and in addition it might be found advisable to have a workshop lorry or a portion of workshop machinery permanently left there. The provision of suitable defences for aerodromes, and such
protection as is considered necessary for a squadron of machines, and the various stores and machinery located at this type of aerodrome will be the responsibility of the Air Officer Commanding, working with the Arab army.  ,Classification (B).The same provisions which have been quoted as necessary in the case of (A) type aerodromes are similarly applicable to (B) type aerodromes, except for the fact that they need only be capable of receiving aircraft up to the number of six, which it is intended should only remain for the day or possibly a couple of days. This will necessitate the maintenance of a somewhat smaller stock of petrol, oil, spares, &amp;c.Suggested aerodromes which might fulfil the classifications are as under, but it is recommended that the actual grounds are decided upon after careful investiga-tion by the Air Officer Commanding in conjunction with the appropriate authorities on the spot.Arbil. Nasiriyeh.Kirkuk. Samawah.Kifri. Diwaniyeh.Khanikin Hillah.Kut-el-Amara. Hit.Amara, Ana,It should be clearly understood that no squadrons should be located at any time in a place where trouble is actually taking place or may appear imminent. This does not refer, of course, to the three main stations. The guiding principle should be to withdraw the squadron from such a place to the next available aerodrome or landing ground of a suitable nature if the main aerodromes are not suitable, and allow it to operate from there. Its maintenance and repair work can then be carried out without the additional complications which would be caused were it to be faced with having to deal with disturbance at its own doorstep. This may mean that detach -ments of the Arab army may be cut off from their normal sources of supply, and mav have to hold out. This they should be able to do for one month at least, and to assist them one or more of the Vickers Vimy Squadrons should be employed in keeping them supplied by air or actually carrying reinforcements to them when necessary. This will, of course, necessitate landings being made, which, in turn, means that aeroplanes while on the ground will require some form of protection.4. Aeroplanes required.With an Arab army properly equipped and trained and located to the best effect in the country, it is considered that the Air Control of Mesopotamia can be satisfactorily accomplished by the employment of the following squadrons: 4 single-engined two-seater squadrons.   (D.H.9a.)1 single-seater squadron.   (Snipe.)1 corps reconnaissance squadron.   (Bristol fighter.)2 twin-engined bombing squadrons (Vickers Vimy, converted to commercial type to take ten to twelve armed men, and capable of carrying a load of cargo for the purpose of supplying posts of troops by air).In addition it may be necessary to add a further two-seater reconnaissance squadron.5. Armoured Cars.Armoured cars should normally be stationed at and form a portion of the garrison at -the three main stations.It is advocated that from four to six armoured car companies be employed, and that the personnel and vehicles be maintained by R.A.F., and manned by R.A.F. personnel. The reasons for this contention are: (a.) The R.A.F. is bound to have its own transport workshop to undertake the constant repair of mechanical transport which they use, and in these workshops repairs can also be effected to the armoured cars.(b.) Technical personnel are required for the handling of armoured cars as well as for the handling of aircraft.  The personnel to man armoured[6117] M
cars could, therefore, be roughly of the same type and same categories as those belonging to the RAF. (p.) With R.A.F. personnel in the air and R.A.F. personnel operating the armoured cars, the closest possible liaison between them could be assured. It must be remembered that in the initial stages it may be necessary to attach a certain number of men from the Army to run the armoured cars. If they were willing to transfer to the R.A.F. this would be more satisfactory as it would take time to enlist and train sufficient men for this purpose.Stores and spares for the purpose of maintaining the armoured cars will always be held at main bases from which they will operate. It is, however, necessary that a small quantity of petrol and oil and assorted spares should also be held at selected (A) or (B) type aerodromes and landing grounds to allow for the occasion on which the armoured cars would be employed at some distance from their proper bases in conjunction with air units. The main repair units for armoured cars should be located at Baghdad, but again this may be investigated on the spot.6. Armoured Trains and River G[unooats.The provision of two armoured trains and three to four shallow draught river gunboats would prove of value in keeping open the rail communications in connec-tion with this scheme.7. Communications.(a.) Roads.The normal means of communication between the three main bases will be by the existing river and rail lines, but the simplicity with which these lines may be cut at any time must not be lost sight of. The alternative which must be considered is that of opening a road which bounds the fringe of the desert on the western edge of Mesopotamia and keeps clear throughout its course of the area under irrigation. Information which has been received points to the possibility that this can be achieved, and the road, capable of carrying fairly heavy transport occasionally, should be used between Busra and falujah via Samarah, following the fringe of the desert which borders Mesopotamia on the west. With experience and use this road could be of value if the garrison were besieged during times of stress.Another main road which must be considered in connection with the air route to be described hereunder is also considered as essential to the success of the scheme of air control.This is the route from Egypt to Mesopotamia starting from Amman in Eastern Palestine and running to Ramadie. This route is to be opened at once, and the method suggested is to make a jump forward of 80 miles or so at a time, establishing at each jump small dumps of petrol and suitable landmarks to assist in marking the route. The care of the dumps of petrol and landmarks should be entrusted to the local Sheikhs who should be paid for the services of personnel employed on their safe keeping and efficient maintenance.The next stage would be the establishment of somewhat larger dumps about 200 to 250 miles apart. The accomplishment of the placing of these dumps should be effected by ordinary light transport.The result would be that an efficiently marked out course across the desert would appear, and with constant use it would become familiar to its users throughout the whole length of its course. The civilising effect of an achievement of this nature is obvious.Occasions may arise on which certain dumps of petrol would be looted, and the road may possibly be cut. With the assistance of aircraft, however, the dis-advantage of this disappears somewhat. Aeroplanes acting in conjunction with armoured cars which are engaged in prospecting or patrolling the route can speedily take sufficient action to reopen the route.A necessary adjunct to the commencement of the operation with a view to the opening of this route is a satisfactory arrangement of the political conditions in Trans jordania or Eastern Palestine. The concurrence of the High Commissioner will have to be sought before the work could be actually commenced.
(b.) Air Route.The opening of a well-defined air route between Egypt and Mesopotamia is vital, not only to the Air control of Mesopotamia, but to the whole policy of our administration in the Middle East. The dumps of petrol supplied in the first instance by the somewhat laborious process of light transport could, in the future, be maintained by air from either end of the road route.(c.) Wireless.Wireless communication is already established between the two ends of the road route.The maintenance of efficient wireless communication throughout the route should go far to ensure that constant touch is kept with all aircraft (and possibly motor transport too) proceeding along the route, thereby enabling assistance to be sent by aircraft should they require it, or to occupants of motor transport in the case of breakdown or attack.Apart from the wireless equipment of the aerial route, wireless personnel and equipment should be distributed as widely.as possible throughout all aerodromes, landing grounds, and stations where detachments of Arab troops and political officers are located throughout Mesopotamia. The principal value of the air as a backing to the efforts of the Arab army in the maintenance of internal order is the fact that the air is able to answer requests for assistance with a celerity which no other arm is capable of. To enable detachments of the Arab army, therefore, to call for this assistance when they require it the ample provision of wireless equipment is most vital, and this particularly applies even in cases where political officers are isolated by themselves without any detachments of the Arab army in the vicinity. Native telegraphists may well be used in this connection.8. Intelligence.The Air relies upon instant action for the full realisation of its power. It is, therefore, most necessary that an efficient. intelligence system should be devised whereby the earliest possible information may be given of any signs of disorder or rebellion, so that the Air may be able to take militant measures and check it in its incipient stage.The best officers procurable should be selected for the control of the Intelligence Department as this will be qf the most vital importance to the success of the scheme.9. Political Officers.Political officers should not have to go to districts which are likely to prove troublesome. They should only be sent to places which are normally peaceful. If districts do become truculent it is then that the Air should apply such action as may be necessary to ensure their return to more peace conditions.Where any political officer is stationed, a regular routine programme or aero-planes visiting that station, if within range of a landing ground, should be carried out as part of the regular method of control.10. Arab Army Garrisons.An Arab army of 15,000 men, of which a proportion could be formed from refugees, is considered necessary for this scheme and will have to be maintained. The three main R.A.P. stations will absorb a good proportion of this force, and the remainder will be stationed at the places which are considered most essential from a purely administrative point of view, provided that a class (A) aerodrome or certainly a class (B) aerodrome is in the vicinity. In this connection it is pointed out that if for any reason it was necessary to retire from one of the outlying stations the loss of prestige would not be so great as the withdrawal of British troops would occasion. Even if it unfortunately happened that an Arab garrison was wiped out, again the loss of prestige would not nearly be so great as if it happened to a British garrison. It might always be possible to withdraw a garrison by air.The need for a large Arab garrison at Baghdad is not great, but the provision of white military mounted police would be advisable.[6117] M 2
11. British Garrison.It would be an advantage to the country if the expense is not too great, to have a British force, of all arms, stationed in some healthy place not too far from the coast as a semi-permanent garrison for the next few years as the moral effect of a force such as this would be very great and would ensure a continuous settled regime in Mesopotamia. It would only be wanted in a great emergency as if the arrange-ments indicated above were carried out they would not be wanted for the immediate running of the country and would not be vitally necessary even to save the country as if the situation got very serious and Baghdad was even cut off completely, Indian troops could be brought to the spot in the same way as was done in the last rising. With British forces in the country the moral effect might be such that a serious situation would not arise and the British trOops would be sufficient to deal with any but a really great emergency.12. Commands.To render the Air Force scheme of control a success after the conditions enumerated above have been realised, it is absolutely essential that the command of all the forces in Mesopotamia be vested in an Air Officer, who should serve under the superior political authority.Given the best will in the world it cannot be possible for the instructions of an Air Officer to be carried out through an intermediary Military commander. In an essentially Air scheme which has been propounded above, the lack of knowledge of the Military commander in Air matters would only tend to produce serious arguments as to the nature of any operations which might be required for any purpose, and also with regard to the actual means of the carrying out of the operations themselves. Should a Military commander prove to be very strong willed with an overpowering personality there is no doubt that he would overinfluence and direct the plans and decisions of the Air Officer serving under him. This, of course, would only tend to produce entire confusion, and foredoom the scheme a failure.13. Administrative Officers.It will be necessary in the first instance to request the loan from the-army of a number of administrative officers, owing to the Air not having sufficient numbers at the moment. Although the Air has officers capable of this work their numbers are not sufficient to undertake a large and new responsibility like this, and there is not a great force to draw upon for this purpose as in the case of the two elder services.(Signed)        H. TRENCHARD. C. A. S.March 12, 1921.C.A.S.Note on Defence of Aerodromes.1. The guiding principle in the provision of suitable defences for aerodromes and landing grounds is that in every case it should be left to the initiative of the local commander to provide the nature of the defence which is best suited to the locality or station for which he is responsible. Although a number of most useful suggestions can always be circulated to local commanders by the superior Air authority, it must be borne in mind that these instructions must on no account be regarded as hard and fast rules for the defence of an aerodrome. Anything in the way of a strictly rigid plan can only lead to extravagance and in many places prove entirely unsuitable for providing efficient defence arrangements.2. With regard to stations, however, it is suggested that the garrisons should be well sited and have properly constructed entrenchments, cupola steel towers, machine-gun emplacements, barbed-wire entanglements, &amp;c. In addition the hangars themselves should be surrounded with walls or banks of earth some six feet high.3. (A) Type Aerodromes. It will not be necessary to have an elaborate defence for (A) type aerodromes, but possibly some form of protection in the way of a Serai or actually a shed with protected banks round it.4. (B) Type Aerodromes. Will have little or no protection, but there might possibly be a low wall or even a Serai provided if the funds available admit of it.
Annexure 3 to Appendix 13.MINUTES OF THE FOURTH MEETING OF THE JOINT POLITICAL ANDMILITARY COMMITTEE.Assembled at 9 a.m., March 18, 1921.President:Lieutenant-General Sir W. Congreve.Members:Lieutenant-General Sir J. A. L. Haldane. Major-General Sir P. P. de B. Radcliffe. Air-Vice-Marshal Sir G. Salmond. Mr. J. B. Crosland.Secretary:Lieutenant-Colonel Waters Taylor.1. The Committee proceed to weigh the respective advantages of Baghdad and Amara as stations for the Imperial forces remaining in Mesopotamia on the C.A.S.&apos;s scheme for control of Mesopotamia by the R.A.F. and local forces coming into operation.2. For the present the Committee do not consider that an Imperial force stationed at Baghdad can do without two extra battalions L. of C. troops, it being at present, and probably for a considerable time to come, inadvisable that military forces should not be responsible for their own communications; but the Committee recognise that experience may showT that improved river gunboats and R.A.F. developments may reduce the number of L. of C. troops.3. The Committee recognise the advantage of concentrating both Imperial and Air forces at Baghdad, but for reasons stated in the above paragraph point out that until experience has proved to the contrary, the location at Baghdad of the Imperial troops necessitates an addition of two infantry battalions as L. of C. troops to the original force of four battalions and one pack battery.4. The distribution of this increased force would be as follows: Baghdad : 2 battalions, 1 pack battery. L. of C. : 3 battalions.5. The Committee at their previous meeting requested Mr. Crosland to prepare .a statement showing the comparative cost of (a.) 12 battalions infantry.1 cavalry regiment.1 field battery.1 pack battery.2 s. and m companies.plus 6 squadrons R.A.F.plus local forces. (b.)   1 brigade infantry.1 pack battery.plus the forces set forth in C.A.S.&apos;s scheme, plus local forces.The exact composition of the two alternative garrisons would be : *(a.) Twelve-battalion scheme:  2 British battalions. 10 Indian battalions. 1 cavalry regiment. 1 R.F.A. battery. 1 Indian pack battery. 2 s. and m. companies.plus departmental and ancillary services, together with 6 squadrons Royal Air Force.The troops to be on the line Basra to Baghdad.
(b.) Four-battalion scheme:  1 British battalion. 3 Indian battalions. I Indian pack battery, plus details, together with full air scheme of8 squadrons, &amp;c, the Air Force to provide its own ancillary services.The troops to be mainly at Basra and Amara, or alternatively mainly at Baghdad.6. Mr. Crosland estimates the annual cost roughly as follows : Million  .(a.) The Imperial force of 12 battalions, &amp;c.     ...        ...     4J6 air squadrons (Sir H. Trenchard&apos;s figure) ...        ...      l\Total 5f* Say, 6 million  .(&amp;.) The Imperial force of 4 battalions, if mainly at Amara 1Full air force, 8 squadrons, &amp;c. (Sir H. Trenchard&apos;s figure) 2fTotal     3f   .Say, 4 million  .If, however, the Imperial forces were mainly at Baghdad, the extra cost of transport would add perhaps J million  ; and if the battalions were all British there would be a further extra cost of some 360,000Z. Thus the four-battalion scheme with the force mainly British and mainly stationed at Baghdad would probably cost some If, plus 21=4^ million  .Further, if the stationing of the main Imperial forces at Baghdad involved battalions on L. of C, making the total number of battalions six instead of four, an extra half-million or so would have to be added to the cost.7. To sum up, the Committee, whilst recognising the advantages in concen-trating the Imperial forces at Baghdad, consider that Amara is the best location for the troops for the following reasons: 1. Economy.2. The fact that Amara forms a safeguard to the oil industry and a bridgeheadto any force arriving from India. 3. It has trees and bathing facilities, and could be made into a more popularstation than Baghdad. 4. That the C.A.S. expressed himself satisfied with it as a location for thetroops.5. That the accommodation already existing at Baghdad will be occupied by R.A.F.The Committee would also point out that though the Air Force could possibly relieve and supply itself by the air in case of emergency, it could not do either for the larger force.Appendix 14. Refugees.EXTRACT FROM MINUTES OF THIRD MEETING OF THE POLITICALCOMMITTEE.March 14, 1921.(For remainder of minutes and composition of Committee, see Appendix 6.)In reply to a question by the Chairman, Sir Percy Cow stated that it would be difficult to provide for the support of the refugees from the 1st April, 1921, when the army would cease to maintain them. Miss Bell stated that she feared that if a number of destitute persons were thrown upon the country it was probable that they would fail to obtain employment, and would therefore only be a source of crime.
The Chairman, while fully appreciating the difficulty of the situation, regretted that it was impossible to meet this charge from Imperial funds, and suggested that the employment of the Assyrians in the local army might be worthy of consideration.In reply to a question by Colonel Lawrence, Sir Percy Cow agreed that if it were possible for them to be controlled by British officers, there would be little fear of public insecurity from them, but as most of them had their families with them they were not only immobile, but needed greater means of support. He said that they originally left Turkey owing to the general anarchy there, but that the Turks did not want them to return.Major Young observed that the question of their emigration to America was already under consideration, but it was most unlikely that this could be arranged. The American Committee for Relief might be able to give them a little money, but this body was winding up its affairs, and could not accept any extension of their existing responsibilities.The discussion then passed to the question of the refugees. Major Young, in reply to the Chairman, gave the departmental point of view, and stated that the American Mission for relief had been approached before his departure from London, and although declining to embark upon any commitment which might become a permanent charge, yet they were ready to augment any sum which was found by the British Government, by way of capital assistance, which would enable the mission to wind up its affairs in Iraq.Major Young considered that as a decision had now been arrived at on the subject of Kurdistan, it would provide a solution if a number of the refugees were enlisted in the local force, which it was proposed to raise, and he suggested that Major-General Ironside should enquire into the question during his forthcoming visit to Mosul, and should, in conjunction with the British Political Officer there, prepare a report for submission to Sir Percy Cox.Miss Bell pointed out that only a small number of the refugees were bachelors, and that it would be difficult for the married men to be enlisted.Sir Percy Cox agreed that, provided both the Assyrians and the Kurds were placed under the control of British officers, the solution would be satisfactory.The Chairman emphasised that no funds were available for the maintenance of these people, and he suggested that the Russians should be shipped to Constanti-nople; the Armenians repatriated; and the Assyrians and Kurds either enlisted or settled on the land. He agreed that General Ironside should enquire into the matter, and he stated that if it were only a question of providing a small amount of money to enable these destitutes to fend for themselves and to earn their own living, he thought it might be possible to obtain it. He asked Sir Percy Cox to discuss the matter with Major Young, and to put up definite proposals on these lines.Note on Refugees. 1. Armenians.In camp near Basra; about 14,000. Not yet warned by ultimatum. Baghdad wired on the 14th asking if new situation could be seized upon for their shipment to Armenia. No provision has been made in the 30 millions for their maintenance. They cannot be absorbed in Mesopotamia or repatriated by land. There are there-fore only two possible alternatives: either to turn them adrift, in which case they would die; or to ship them either to Armenia or some other destination, which would involve some expenditure.The first of these alternatives cannot be entertained without loss of prestige. They must therefore be shipped away, preferably to Armenia. The first step appears to be to arrange the shipping and notify the Foreign Office that we are sending them back to the neighbourhood of Armenia, asking them to advise at what port on the Black Sea they should disembark.(A draft telegram is submitted.)2. Russians.In camp at Basra; about 800.   Not yet warned by ultimatum.These refugees were evacuated from the Caspian by military authorities as a war measure. No provision has been made in the 30 millions for their maintenance. They are really no concern of Colonial Office or Mesopotamian Government.   It is
not practicable either to keep them in Basra or to send them back to Russia. They are in the same position as the Russian refugees in Egypt, who are being well looked after by the military authorities and helped by local charity.The most economical step would be to ship them to Egypt to join their coin-patriots, who are under War Office charge. It was the War Office which arranged for their evacuation from Enzeli on some conditions entered into with Bolshevik commander. Egypt is at any rate one step on their way home. There will be con-siderable mortality among them if they remain in Basra through the hot weather.(Draft telegram is submitted.)3. Assyrians.There are now 12,000 Mountaineers and 8,000 Urmian refugees in camp at Mindan, near Mosul.The Urmians have had one chance of getting back and failed. They have been warned that from the 1st April no funds are available for their maintenance, and they must fend for themselves from that date. If they decide to make another attempt to get home some small provision of arms will be necessary as their villages are now occupied by Kurds. Even this will probably not save them from being killed.   Two alternative proposals have been made for them: (a.) Emigration to America,   This has been examined and rejected.(&amp;.) Emigration to French zone. The Foreign Office asked the French Govern-ment to let them know definitely by the 28th February if they would receive them, and said that in default of a reply by that date we would consider ourselves free to make our own arrangements. No report has been received of result of this communication.The American relief fund is prepared to consider a proposal that they should share any initial expense incurred in settling either Urmians or Mountaineers, but as Urmians cannot be settled locally this will not help us as far as they are concerned, except that the Americans may like to provide them with small outfit on leaving.Failing the French solution and in default of a recurring and indefinite liability on the British or Mesopotamian taxpayer, the only course open to us appears to be to arm them and turn them cut to fight their way back if they can. A small number may perhaps find their way into the new levies.Mountaineers. The camp will be broken up on the 1st April. There seems a fair prospect of these 12,000 being settled locally in conjunction with the new levy scheme.   A certain number will also be absorbed in the levies themselves.The capital expenditure involved in disposing of them should not be provided for in the Mesopotamian budget, but must be met by the grant-in-aid, relieved as far as possible by the help of American charity. We must be prepared to face a possible maximum of 20O,000Z. non-recurring expenditure on refugees for this year, as against the large yearly total on maintenance in previous years.  .(A draft telegram is submitted.)(Signed)        P. Z. COX.Appendix 15. Mesopotamia: Finance.FIRST MEETING OF COMMITTEE ON MESOPOTAMIAN FINANCE.March 19, 1921. Present:The Right Hon. Winston Spencer Churchill. Sir Percy Cox, G.C.I.E., K.C.S.I.Major-General Sir P. P. de B. Radciifie. K.C.M.G., C.B., D.S OMajor-General Atkinson, C.B., C.M.G., C.I.E.Colonel T. E. Lawrence.Colonel Slater.Major H. W. Young, D.S.O.R. D. Badcock, Esq.After discussion of the reports submitted separately by the Financial Adviser in Mesopotamia, The Chairman agreed with the remainder of the Committee that it
was preferable to consider all expenditure and receipts in Mesopotamia, whether civil or military, up to and including the 31st March, 1921, as Imperial. The accrued surplus of approximately 300 lakhs which was claimed by the Mesopotamian Government would thus remain with His Majesty&apos;s Treasury, and all outstanding claims by His Majesty&apos;s Government against the Civil Administration of Mesopotamia would be wiped out.This might entail some reduction in the large staff of clerks who were now said to be engaged in Mesopotamia in endeavouring to assess various claims as between the Civil Administration and the War Office. It would also allow of a corresponding reduction in the finance staff of the Military Administration. All charges in respect of the mandated territories in the Middle East, both military and civil, would come on the Middle Eastern Services Vote.Sub-Committee to report on the possibility of the purchase of certain public works in Mesopotamia by the Arab Government.Members :Major-General Atkinson. Mr. Crosland. Colonel Frith. Lieutenant-Colonel Slater.1. A report was prepared in 1919 on this subject by Sir John Hewett, but the data and proposals are now very much out of date.2. A very large amount of the property of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Mesopotamia is not only useful to the country but vital to its development. The present financial circumstances of the country, however, preclude payment for this property unless the valuation is reduced on very liberal lines and the capital sum is regarded as a loan on which interest is paid and is within the means of the Mesopotamian Government to pay. As all attempts to take over these properties with a view to commercialise them have been hung up owing to no definite decision being forthcoming as to the terms of capital cost, the Committee consider it vital that these decisions should be come to at once if military estimates are to be relieved of these burdens in the near future. This is entirely a matter for His Majesty&apos;s Treasury.3. A great deal of property has been already handed over to the Mesopotamian Government, without any definite decision as to capital value.   This represents: (1.) Port.(2.) Railways.(3.) Posts and telegraphs.(4.) Certain bridges.4. Port. This only awaits negotiation with the Treasury, and a valuation has been sent home by G.H.Q. to the War Office.Railways. It is believed that negotiations are on hand to form a company to take over certain railways. The Civil Government, however, can only take over as a capital purchase for commercial purposes the Baghdad-Basra-Khaniqin Railway.The Baghdad-Kut, Baghdad-Fallujah and Baghdad-Shergat lines are now entirely required for military purposes, and, though the Mesopotamian Government or company would be willing to run these lines, the actual running costs would have to be charges to the military authorities. As the reduction of garrison stations takes place the lines serving these stations could be dismantled or disposed of.But the military authorities consider that, though they will mainly use the river route between Kut and Baghdad in the near future, the Kut-Baghdad Railway must be maintained for the present. If maintained solely for military purposes, the cost of maintenance would be a direct charge against military estimates, but, if the line were run by the Mesopotamian Government or a company for general traffic, the military estimates would be charged a proportionate share of the rates charged to cover the loss involved on the Baghdad-Basra Railway by the competition of the Kut-Baghdad Railway, subject to any military concession which may be in force, and subject to any reservations which the Treasury may make in fixing the capital cost.   &apos;Posts and Telegraphs. The only outstanding point is a decision as to the cost of certain telephones taken over as a temporary measure pending the provision of more efficient machines.Bridges. Practically every bridge has been taken over except Ramadi and Dhibbin, which were required for purely military purposes, but, if a liberal view of[6117] 1 N
8-1capital price is taken, the Civil Government should take over the responsibility for all bridges.E. and M. Services.- The Civil Administration were always anxious to take over the E. and M. Services, but, at the present moment, their revenues will not permit them to take over the financial responsibility for this large service.They are prepared to take over a large number of the power plants with a view to them being worked by companies or municipalities.Here again the want of decision as to capital cost has held over these negotiations.A Committee has been formed in Baghdad to consider each installation in detail, and it is hoped His Majesty&apos;s Treasury can give an early decision as to the terms on which they can be handed over.There are, however, many services which cannot be commercialised and are used for purely military purposes, and these must be handed over to the Disposals Board when no longer required by the military, if the Civil Government cannot take them.5. The question of the handing over of arms and equipment for use of the Arab army was considered. As there is no local market and the cost of removing these from Mesopotamia would be large, it is recommended that such arms, equipment and ammunition as may be required should be handed over free.6. The Committee recommended that in all these cases the present system, whereby property surplus to military requirements is handed over to the Disposals Board, requires reconsideration.A more suitable criterion seems to be the requirements of the authorities, whether civil or military, and the transfer should be based on direct negotiation between the Treasury and the Civil Government.The Disposals Board has practically disappeared in Mesopotamia.March 19, 1921.SECOND MEETING OF COMMITTEE ON MESOPOTAMIAN FINANCE.March 23, 1921. Present:Sir G. Barstow. Sir Percy Cox. J. B. Crosland, Esq. Colonel Slater. General Atkinson. Colonel Frith. Major Young. Mr. Myrddin-Evans.The Committee had under consideration the question of the adjustment of accounts as between the Military and Civil Administrations, and had before them certain general principles to serve as a basis of discussion.1. Accounts of Military and Civil Administrations.It was suggested that all expenditure and receipts during the British occupation up to the 31st March, 1921, should be regarded as Imperial and that all accrued surplus balances from the Civil Administration and all military assets should be transferred to the Colonial Office as at the 1st April, 1921. On behalf of the Imperial Government it was pointed out that, apart from the purely military expenditure in Mesopotamia, which had been considerable, and from that of the Civil Administration, whose balance-sheet had shown a surplus up to the last two years, there were certain cross-charges for adjustment as between the Civil and Military Administrations. These cross-charges had proved jnost troublesome to settle, and, in order to make for simplification and to avoid interminable alterca-tions, it was proposed that all expenditure, whether military or civil, up to the 31st March. 1921, should be regarded as one, and that any surplus, whether in material or cash, should become the property of the Imperial Government. This would give Mesopotamia a clean slate with which to start the financial year 1921-22. It was suggested that the surplus balances accruing to the Civil Administration had arisen owing to the fact that the military had paid for many works and services that
normally would have been provided by the Civil Administration, and the Imperial Exchequer therefore had a claim on these balances on this account as well under the laws of war as being the occupying Power.On behalf of the Mesopotamian Government it was stated that the surplus had really arisen through our inability to spend as much on the country as we should have done. The surplus on Civil Administration belonged to the occupying Power only after that Power had fulfilled all its obligations towards the occupying territory, and this we had been unable to do. In any case, it seemed highly probable that there would be no final surplus balance on the 31st March, and, if the result of pooling military and civil expenditure up to that date was to show an apparent deficit, it would lay the Civil Administration open to the charge that they had spent more money than they had received, whereas the money had been spent in anticipa-tion of receipts from the military (e.g., 62 lakhs for grain and full port charges instead of the 75 per cent, actually paid), which would, in fact, never materialise. In this case, if the proposal were carried to its logical conclusion, Mesopotamia might be left to start the new financial year with no working balance against an estimated necessary working balance of 100 lakhs. They would prefer that military and civil expenditure should be kept quite distinct, and that any surplus on the Civil Administration should be available for spending in Mesopotamia They would not, however, press this view if the Committee strongly felt otherwise.In the course of the discussion regarding the disposal of the various assets, it was pointed out that certain buildings and works (e.g., the High Commissioners house), which had been constructed out of Mesopotamian revenues, would probably be retained by the Imperial Government, and it would be necessary to take this into account. As regards Imperial assets, it was felt that, as Great Britain had accepted the mandate for Mesopotamia and in view of the necessity of starting that State well, facilities should, as far as possible, be granted to the Mesopotamian Government to acquire such works as they desired from the Imperial Government.The Committee were informed that the Secretary of State desired that the Mesopotamian Budget should show a contribution towards defence. Sir Percy Cox explained that the provisional budget for 1921-22 already provided for the maintenance of Arab forces, which he hoped would increase in future years, and that Mr. Churchill had agreed to accept this solution as meeting his desires.After further discussion the Committee agreed on the following general principles : 1. The Imperial Government to be responsible for any net difference between expenditure and receipts (on a cash basis), whether civil or military, in Mesopotamia up to the 31st March, 1921.(If there is a civil cash surplus it will be available to reduce the grant in aid required for Mesopotamia; if a civil deficit, the grant in aid would have to be increased. The arrangement will obviate a considerable amount of cross-charges between civil and military, and will result in a reduction of receipts on which the Civil Administration have been counting.)2. Apart from the net cash surplus or deficit, there are certain capital assets derived from money expended from Vote of Credit or Army funds, e.g., railways, port, electrical appliances, bridges, telegraphs, &amp;c.; all these to be vested in the Colonial Office as from the 1st April, 1921. But, as a general principle, all properties which have been paid for by civil revenues, as shown in the expenditure accounts of the Civil Administra-tion of Mesopotamia, will be vested in the Mesopotamian Government.3. The Imperial assets to be disposed of as soon as convenient, as far as possible to the Mesopotamian Government at a fair valuation; failing that, to private persons or companies.(The payments by Mesopotamian Government would not necessarily, or even probably, be made in cash; their total would constitute a debt due by Mesopotamia- to the Home Government, which should be interest-bearing, but payment of interest might be deferred until the finances of Mesopotamia are in a position to bear them.)4. The Budget of Mesopotamia should in future meet all civil charges, and, in addition, provide a contribution to Imperial military charges. For the present this contribution will take the form of the provision made for an Arab army to enable Imperial forces to be reduced.Railway capital charges could not, however, be met from current revenues in Mesopotamia.[6117] N 2
Note by Sir George Barstow.Mesopotamia: Suggested Financial Arrangements.1. The Imperial Government to be responsible for any net difference between expenditure and receipts (on a cash basis), whether civil or military, in Mesopotamia up to the 31st March, 1921.(If there is a civil cash surplus it will be available to reduce the grant-in-aid required for Mesopotamia; if a civil deficit, the grant-in-aid would have to be increased. The arrangement will obviate a considerable amount of cross-charges between civil and military, and will result in a reduction of receipts on which the Civil Administration have been counting.)2. Apart from the net cash surplus or deficit, there are certain capital assets derived from money expended from vote of credit or army funds, e.g., railways, port, electrical appliances, bridges, telegraphs, &amp;c., all these to be vested in the Colonial Office as from the 1st April, 1921. But as a general principle all properties which have been paid for by civil revenues as shown in the expenditure accounts of the Civil Administration of Mesopotamia, will be vested in the Mesopotamian Government.3. The Imperial assets to be disposed of as soon as convenient, as far as possible to the Mesopotamian Government, at a fair valuation, failing that, to private persons or companies.(The payments by Mesopotamian. Government would not necessarily, or even probably, be made in cash; their total would constitute a debt due by Mesopotamia to the Home Government, which should be interest-bearing, but payment of interest might be deferred until the finances of Mesopotamia are in a position to bear them.)A short discussion took place on the question of the railway and port charges to be made against the War Office. It was understood that the Secretary of State held the view that no charges should be made against the War Office until the railways and ports were definitely handed over to the Mesopotamian Government.It was agreed to place on record the following decision : &quot;The Committee have carefully considered the suggestion of the Secretary of State for the Colonies that no charges should be made against the War Office for the use of the railways and ports pending the handing over of these services to the Mesopotamian Government. They are of the opinion, however, that (at all events in the case of the railways) it would be more convenient, more economical and would tend to expedite the working of the services as purely commercial concerns if the War Office continued to pay at concession rates for services rendered.&quot;3. Postal Facilities.Attention was drawn to the fact that Government military officials in Mesopotamia were still allowed to post letters free of charge, and it was agreed that it was desirable that this practice should cease as soon as possible.4. The question was raised of the ownership of buildings and works (such as military barracks, &amp;c.) which might be built for the Imperial Government during the period before the Mesopotamian Government took over full control of the country, but which the Imperial Government might not then desire to retain. It was agreed that no recommendation could be usefully made at the present time.5. Disposals Board in Mesopotamia.Attention was drawn to the fact that the personnel of the Disposals Board in Mesopotamia was considerably reduced and was unable to cope with the task of assuming charge over the material surplus to army requirements. For much of this material there was no market in Mesopotamia; it was expensive to guard and would be more expensive to move, and it would be more economical to destroy a great part of it.It was agreed that the War Office and the Ministry of Munitions should be invited to authorise the G.O.C.-in-C., Mesopotamia (if necessary by making him an ex officio member of the Disposals Board), to decide what material, surplus to army requirements, should be preserved and what destroyed.
4. The budget of Mesopotamia should in future meet all civil charges, and in addition provide a contribution to Imperial military charges. For the present this contribution will take the form of the provision made for an Arab army to t&apos;table Imperial forces to be reduced.Railway capital charges could not, however, be met from current revenues in Mesopotamia.The view of the Conference was that after the 1st April, 1921, payments should be made by the army for military user of (1.) Railways, (2.) Ports,(3.) Posts and telegraphs,and similar services if any rendered by the Administration. These payments to be made at concession rates on the &quot;reduction on quantity&quot; principle, and charges should not be raised to cover interest on capital so long as no interest is being paid.This course is recommended as conducive to economy. Otherwise the tempta-tion to excessive use of a free service becomes overwhelming. The accounts will also show more accurately the true cost of the garrison on the one hand, and of the departmental service on the other. In any case, it would be necessary to have fro forma accounts even if no money passed; so that the proposal does not involve the maintenance of heavy establishment charges.Moreover, the railways, &amp;c, services could not be allowed to run at a loss, and if the principle of no payment by the army were adopted, this would necessarily follow, and involve subsidising the railway either from local revenues or the grant-in-aid.Mesopotamia Budget.Balance.The arrangements agreed to in principle by the Secretary of State, will start Mesopotamia fair at the beginning of 1921-22 without a balance for or against. What her existing balance is seems to be open to question, for the accounts for earlier years which have been sent to India for completion of audit have never been returned. But on their own records, a balance of 294 lakhs* appears to have been accumulated up to the 31st March, 1920, with which the current financial year was started. The whole of this and probably something over will have disappeared by the end of the year. 69 lakhs are accounted for by capital expenditure (50 railway, 10 post, 9 Basra telephone exchange), 65 lakhs by railway deficit, 130 lakhs by general deficit.The Civil Administration had counted oil obtaining certain payments from army-votes, the receipt of which would have converted their small deficit into a fairly substantial surplus. But the fact that there has been an insurrection is quite a sufficient reason for the deficit; the railways, which were handed to the Civil Administration at the beginning of the year, have naturally been run at a loss, and there seems no sufficient reason for saddling the British taxpayer through army expenditure with the indirect cost of the insurrection when there are surplus balances from which they can be met.Revenue, 1921-22.The estimate for revenue is 565 lakhs. I am assured that this is on a conserva-tive basis and therefore should be realised. Land tax, for instance, is estimated for at a less amount than the estimate for the current year.The revenue estimate does not take into calculation the receipts under Railways, Port, Ottoman Debt and Sulaimanieh, the first two because they are self-contained services; the Ottoman Debt because it is assumed that the revenues formerly affected to the debt will continue to be applied to the purpose; and Sulaimanieh because this province is in a somewhat anomalous position and will probably require fiscal autonomy.Of the revenue two-thirds are provided by two taxes, customs (250 lakhs) and land tax (130 lakhs) the former including some excise duties and licences and the balance by some half-dozen other taxes and sources of revenue. It is noticeable that except through customs duties (which he can probably pass on) the rich Baghdadi or Basra merchant does not contribute at all to taxation, or at least not in proportion to his ability to pay.   Income tax would, if effective, be the best way of achieving this* A lakh is 100,000 rupees = 10.000Z. if rupee is at 2s.; 6.666/. at 1*. U.
result, but possibly death duties or legacy duties, and some form of stamp taxation on exchange operations would raise additional revenue from the business community.The present is not, however, a favourable time for imposing fresh taxation in Mesopotamia in view of the political situation. Land tax especially will have to be somewhat tenderly administered or it may cost more in military and police measures than it is worth. It is proposed, however, to institute inquiries with a view to levying income tax to be operative in 1922-23, and this and other sources of taxation, old and new, should be more productive in later years.Customs depends on various incalculable factors the internal condition of Persia and whether trade routes via, the Caucasus are open among others.Revenue in Future Years.Mr. Slater has given me a provisional estimate as to possible growth of revenue in the next few vears. He calculates that it should accrue so as to increase this year&apos;s 565 lakhs by 20 lakhs in 1922-23, 55 lakhs in 1923-24, 100 lakhs in 1924-25,i.e., revenue should amount to 665 lakhs in that year. Thereafter it should continue to increase, possibly after five years, when oil properties may begin to pay and further land development may be coming into fruition, the increase may be at a more rapid rate.Expenditure, 1921-22.The expenditure estimate shows a small surplus (about 6 lakhs) for 1921-22. Although based on the experience of the current and former years, it is hardly so much an estimate of expenditure as a &quot; ration &quot; within which heads of departments will have to confine their activities.Provided that the civil revenues can bear all civil expenditure, and in addition find an adequate sum as a contribution to the cost of defence, the Treasury is not likely to have any views as to the way in which the local authorities exercise their discretion in allocating civil expenditure. The estimates do not appear to be excess-sive in any one particular; in fact, they are said to be &quot; cut to the bone &apos;&apos;; and barely provide sufficient funds towards education, public works, irrigation and medical services to justify a claim that enough is being done for the social and material improvement of the people. That the sum provided is on a low scale is shown by a comparison of some of the principal items of optional expenditure with the figures of Sir A. T. Wilson&apos;s provisional budget for the previous year 1920-21, e.g. : Lakhs 1920-21. Lakhs 1921-22.Irrigation ...        ...        ...        69 35Public works        ...        ...        98 50Medical   ...        ...        ...        50 30Education           ...        ...        17^ 20Public Works.The provision under this head is 50 lakhs, allocated as follows: Lakhs.Continuation works            ...         ...        ... ...     14Establishment        ...        ...        ...        ... ...     10New works           ...        ...        ...        ... ...     10Electricity and rent charges ...        ...        ... ...       5Maintenance of roads and bridges     ...        ... ...       8New and unforeseen works   ...        ...        ... ...       350The provision for new works (the only item on which economies might be effected) includes 1 lakh towards the building of a Memorial Hospital to General Maude at Basra, to supplement voluntary contributions; 2 lakhs for schools; 2 lakhs for barracks for local military forces; 1 lakh for land acquisition; 1 lakh for the enlargement of the customs wharf at Baghdad; 1 lakh for police barracks; f lakh for a post office at Basra. These are said to represent the minimum of what is considered
essential, although there are several other projects which are most urgent, such as the building of a new north bridge over the river at Baghdad.Defence.The provision for defence the Arab army is 55 lakhs in the Estimate. This is just under 10 per cent, of the total revenue and not bad for a beginning, but the Defence Force ought for the present to take at least 15 per cent, of the revenue. Next year, 1922-23, the estimate for defence cannot be less than 80 lakhs, and it is evident that, as the strength of the Arab force increases, this will absorb the probable increase of revenue for some time to come. By the time it reaches a strength of 15,000 the expenditure will be 250 lakhs per annum on defence.It is evident that the increase of the Defence Force is likely to be the dominating feature of Mesopotamian finance in the course of the next three years. It is from this increase that the British Exchequer will derive the maximum relief by the reduction in the garrison, and the social and educational services of Mesopotamia must stand still until revenue increases, so long as the paramount necessity for national defence has still to be provided. An Arab soldier costs, say, 100Z. as compared with 300/., the cost per head of British forces.Purchase of Capital Assets.This consideration affects also the position as regards the purchase by the Arab Government of the fixed capital assets created by British expenditure from Army Votes and Vote of Credit, viz., the port, the railways, electrical establishments, bridges, &amp;c. It is only fair that the British taxpayer should get back something from the vast expenditure incurred. But the Arab Government would be unable to pay for the whole in cash; even a small part could only be met with great difficulty. It seems reasonable, therefore, to accept a deferred payment, and Mr. Slater and I thought that it might be agreed that deferment should continue until the revenue has reached 750 lakhs, provided that the Defence Force expands to the extent at present contemplated, that is to say, defence should absorb the next 200 lakhs of revenue and repayment of debt only begin thereafter. There is, however, a danger that if the repayment is put off for too long the obligation to make it would be forgotten; and (after conversation with Sir A. T. Wilson) I am now disposed to suggest that payment at a nominal rate should begin after next year, say, 1921-22, nil; 1922-23 and subsequent years, 1 lakh, in order to keep the obligation alive.It is assumed that, including the railways, the total amount of the debt (on the basis of the present value) would be about 4,000,000/. Simple interest at 6 per cent, should also be added. This procedure is, of course, much more generous than the only alternative, viz., to &quot;sweat&quot; off the current estimates of expenditure a sum equal to, say, 30 lakhs, in order to provide for interest payments forthwith. If Mesopotamia is really going to make a great effort to meet her defence charges this seems inadvisable; a reduction which would cripple the Administration would probably alienate supporters.Capital Expenditure.Mesopotamia will probably have great difficulty in raising a loan in the market in order to provide for capital development for some time to&apos;come, until political conditions are more settled. But there is a good deal of money in Baghdad which might be obtained on loan for suitable development schemes, e.g., for irrigation and possibly some railway extension lines to places of pilgrimage, e.g., Kerbela. Loans from the British Government or on British Government credit by means of a guarantee are not likely to be favourably received in view of the pressure on national finances.This points to the importance of interesting private capital in Mesopotamia and affords a strong argument for a sale to private capitalists of such assets as railways, if a suitable offer can be obtained. Private management is likely to be more efficient than Government management; private arrangements for obtaining capital are much more elastic. The railway, for instance, is likely to require from 4 to 6 millions sterling capital expenditure in the next few years. It would be an immense relief to Mesopotamian finance to transfer the liability to raise fresh railway capital to private undertakers. Mesopotamian Government credit would then be available for schemes not suited to private enterprise.Political considerations would require to be of great weight to outweigh the commercial advantage of private railway management.
Note by Secretary of State.I agree in principle with Sir G. Barstow&apos;s proposals. But it should not be assumed that the Arab army will, even with its Kurdish contingent, ever reach a total of 15,000. Up to the present no sanction has been given beyond 5,000 for the Arab army, 3,000 existing local Arab levies which will gradually disappear as the Arab army develops, and 3,000 Kurdish levies ultimate total 8,000. It would not be safe to trust the country entirely to Arab forces, and for many years a British and Indian garrison, with a strong air force, will be required in the key position. The cost of these forces will, it is hoped, be met during the next three years by a grant-in-aid not exceeding an average of 5 or 6 millions a year. Any surplus from Mesopotamian revenues available after the Arab and Kurdish forces have been maintained can, of course, be devoted to reducing the grant-in-aid. Ultimately, one may hope for further reduction in the garrison and further increases in the contribu-tion from Mesopotamian revenues. But it is futile to make any forecast beyond the next three financial years after this one, i.e., 1922, 1923 and 1924.(Initialled)        W. S. C.April 2, 1921.Notes of a Conversation between Sir G. Barstow and Colonel Slateron Thursday, March 24, at 5-30 p.m.1. Currency.Sir G. Barstow and Colonel Slater agreed that it was not desirable to change the currency at present.2. Repayment of.the Debts of the Imperial Ottoman Bank.This Bank was treated as an enemy bank and closed on our occupation of Baghdad in 1917. It was subsequently reopened, but none of the former transactions were allowed to be completed. The pre-war transactions were on a gold basis, and the transactions&apos; after the outbreak of war but preoccupation oh a paper currency basis. The question arose as to the basis on which the debts of the bank, amounting to about 100,000 lira should be liquidated. The Bank claimed that they are repayable in currency; but the Bank was expressly exempted from the application of the order of May 1920, which provided for the repayment in Turkish paper currency of debts specifically expressed to be payable in that currency.The Mesopotamian Government proposed that: (1.) Pre-war debts should be repayable in gold.(2.) Debts contracted between the outbreak of war and the occupation of i Baghdad should be converted into sterling at the rate of exchange of [ the day of the transaction.As regards (2) the Bank claimed conversion should be made at the rate of the date of occupation.Colonel Slater stated that the Mesopotamian Government would submit the proposals (1) and (2) to the Colonial Office.3. Rate of Conversion for Sterling Remittances.The question was raised of the rate of conversion to be adopted for sterling remittances (money orders, &amp;c).It was agreed to recommend that the rate of conversion should be decided by the Colonial Office who should inform Mesopotamia of the rates at stated intervals  say every fourteen days.The estimated capital requirements for the railway are in 1921-22 alone 50 lakhs, and its expenditure will probably not admit of a better, price being received a year hence for the railway than could be obtained now. Repeated applications to Parliament for additional railway capital charges are likely to be badly received and to provoke requests for similar grants nearer home.
4. Grants-in-Aid to Mesopotamia.Sir G. Barstow informed Colonel Slater that the principle on which grants-in-aid were now made to protectorates was that such grants were in general to be regarded as loans repayable by annuities beginning after a certain period.5 Ottoman Public Debt.Colonel Slater referred to the annuity payable by Mesopotamia under the Treaty of Sevres in respect of the Ottoman Public Debt, which constituted an at present unknown liability. He had not included in the Budget for 1921-22, any provision for this, and had also omitted from the revenue side those revenues formerly assigned to the service of the debt. He was proceeding on the assumption that the annuity would not be greater than the assigned revenues; but such figures as he had which were admittedly incomplete, seemed to indicate that the annuity would be much greater,It appeared desirable that steps should be taken to find out what the annuity was likely to amount to, and Sir G. Barstow promised to enquire of Sir Herbert Samuel who should be asked for this information.Extract from Notes of Conversation held on March 24, 1921.   -(For remainder of minutes and composition of meeting see Appendix 16.)Dredging of the Bar at Basra.3. Mr. Nicholls explained a proposal of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for the dredging of the bar at Basra. He stated that this was a very necessary under-taking (the maximum draft of boats crossing the bar was only 19 ft. 6 in.), which had not been attempted hitherto on account of the inability of the parties interested to obtain satisfactory guarantees.  His proposal was as follows: (1.) The Anglo-Persian Oil Company would undertake the dredging operations. (2.) The Company would be exempt from dredging dues for a period of fifteen years.(3.) At the end of five years the Port Authority or the Arab Government should have the option of repaying the Company for the capital expenditure which had been incurred, and of completing the undertaking. In that case the Company would pay the ordinary dredging dues.(4.) The Port Authority should either increase the lighting dues or charge new dredging dues and the increase, after deduction of expenses and coin-mission, should be handed over to the Anglo-Persion Oil Company, in reduction of their total expenditure.(5.) A new company should be formed to undertake the operation, the Port Authority being represented on the Board.Mr. Nicholls stated that his fellow Directors in London desired to have further security as regards their Capital expenditure The sort of thing required he thought was a definite undertaking that, at the end of a fixed period, the money would be raised to repay the capital outlay.The difficulty is that neither the Port Authority nor indeed the Mesopotamian Government is yet set up, and it is therefore impossible to give a binding promise that the necessary money to repay the Anglo-Persian Oil Company will be raised at some future date. The Company appear however to regard the matter as one of great urgency, and to be anxious to get on with the work, and they might probably be prepared to accept an assurance that if the anticipated constitutional arrange-ments were carried through, and a properly constituted Port Authority set up, an effort will be made to raise the money necessary to repay them their outlay.The next step appears to be to refer to London, as Mr. Nicholls is quite vague as to the kind of additional security desired by his fellow Directors.Mesopotamian Budget 1921-22. n4. A discussion took place on the provisional Mesopotamian Budget for 1921-22.[6117] 0
Colonel Slater explained that the figures were very approximate as he had not obtained estimates from the various departments, owing to the fact that the constitu-tion and policy of the departments was not yet decided. The provisional estimate showed a surplus of revenue over expenditure of 5 lakhs, although 55 lakhs were included in the expenditure for the provision of an Arab army.The question of the charge for the High Commissioner and his staff was also raised, and a suggestion was made that the cost should be apportioned as follows : High Commissioner and personal staff:  to be shared equally betweenMesopotamia and Great Britain. Secret Service : the same.Political Secretary&apos;s Staff with cypher establishment: to be borne by Great Britain.The remaining cost to be borne by Mesopotamia.Appendix 16,-Mesopotamia: Railways.EXTRACT FROM MINUTES OF FIRST MEETING OF COMMITTEE, ONMESOPOTAMIAN FINANCE.March 15, 1921.(For remainder of minutes and composition of Committee, see Appendix 15.)IT was decided that careful accounts of the expenditure on the&apos; railways in Mesopotamia should be kept, but that so long as the railway remained under the control of the Middle East Department, troops would be moved in Mesopotamia at the actual cost prices. It was quite possible that the railway would not pay, and in this case it would be necessary that a grant-in-aid should be made to cover the running expenses, and any deficit which appeared on the books would be made good from the Colonial Office.General Atkinson pointed out that the railway was in urgent need of capital expenditure, and he produced a statement explaining the causes and reasons for * his recommendation. If it was decided in the future that the railway should pass under the control of a private company it would be false economy to allow the whole system to deteriorate rapidly, as it was now doing, as it would only fetch a much smaller amount of money on transfer.The Chairman agreed that it was preferable that certain necessities should be provided which would enable the service on the railway to be maintained, and to prevent further deterioration. The railway could then be used by the troops. He deprecated extensive repairs to the line provided that it was in such a state that it could actually be used, and in no case should new branches of railways be made owing to the uncertainty of the political situation. He thought that the present moment was an unsuitable one to approach a private company for the sale of the railway, as it was quite possible that in a short period, if the recommendations which had been submitted for the solution of the political situation, and which he hoped would be approved, were successful, the railway would be of very much greater value than it was in the present state of uncertainty, and of possible public insecurity.
MEETING ON MESOPOTAMIAN RAILWAYS.March 21, 1921. Present:The Rt. Hon. Winston Spencer Churchill (Chairman). Sir Percy Cox, G.C.I.E., K.C.S.I.Major-General E. H. de V. Atkinson, C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O. J. B. Crosland, Esq. Colonel Slater.Major H. W. Young, D.S.O.Consultative Members:Colonel Sir A. T. Wilson (representing Messrs. Strick, Scott and Co.(Limited), and Pearsons). Mr. H. E. Nicholls (representing the Anglo-Persian Oil Company).The Chairman reiterated his previous statement that he considered the moment was not propitious for the sale of the railway. He fully realised that it was essential that a small amount of capital expenditure should be incurred to prevent the railway falling into a state of complete disrepair, and. to maintain it in the meanwhile. This sum would of course be taken into account in the sale of the railway, if, and when, such transaction were effected.Colonel Sir A. T. Wilson remarked that the guarantee (8 to 6 per cent, on preference, 8 per cent, on debentures) which was required from the Government by the group which he represented might be limited to a period of say ten years. He considered that if the railway were handed over to the Arab Government there would be less risk of its destruction by the inhabitants, as the Arab Government would be anxious not to damage an asset of their own. The present railway was not built on a suitable permanent gauge, and the proposals which had been prepared by the group which he represented contemplated converting in ten years&apos; time to standard gauge. If the railway were to be run by His Majesty&apos;s Government at their own cost in competition with river traffic this arrangement would suit his interests. He considered that the probable earning capacity of the railway did not justify an offer of over 2 million pounds for the railway as it stood, and the figures included in his proposals were based upon this assumption. As regards the Haifa-Hit line, in reply to the Chairman he stated that a representative of his group (Mr. H. R. Lowis) would accompany the Survey Party from Palestine. He agreed that the railway would be of great assistance to the laying of the pipe-line which on present proposals would be of 10 in. or i2 in. diameter. The pipe-line alone would not make the railway a paying concern; and the railway must be regarded on its merits as a commercial proposition apart from its potential utility from the point of view of the pipe-line.The Chairman regretted that it was impossible to give a decision, especially as Sir Arthur Wilson had been put to so much inconvenience in coming out to Cairo. He felt that the projects were of such magnitude and would be of such interest to the British public, that no decisions could be given without very close study of the matter by experts in England. In the meanwhile he hoped that every effort would be made to prepare the way for the schemes, which he hoped would develop in the future, and he particularly trusted that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would not prematurely embark upon any undertaking to utilise a route for the pipe-line through French territory, which might seriously affect British interests generally as well as those of the Company.16117&apos;
Notes of a Conversation held on Thursday, March 24, 1921.Present:Sir G. Barstow.Colonel Slater.General Atkinson (for 1).Major Young (for 4).Sir A. T. Wilson (for 2 and 3).Mr. Nicholls (for 2 and 3).Mr. Myrddin-Evans.Mesopotamian Railway Expenditure.1. General Atkinson explained the railway system in Mesopotamia and outlined his proposals for capital expenditure for the coming year. He desired authority to spend approximately 350,000/. during 1921-22 on capital works such as rolling-stock, locomotives, workshops, &amp;c, as the first part of a sum of about 6 million pounds, which would need to be spent on the railways in the course of the next few years, either by the Government or by any company which might take them over. Current expenditure should as far as possible be met out of the revenues.As regards the question of the payment by Mesopotamia of the capital value of the railways it was proposed that in order to obviate the. difficulties of arriving at an agreed valuation and with a view to treating Mesopotamia as generously as possible, a sum should be fixed after examination of Mesopotamia&apos;s financial posi-tion, which, while having some relation to the total capital value of all these works, should be determined mainly having regard to Mesopotamia&apos;s ability to pay interest and sinking-fund charges thereon; and that this sum should then be taken as the amount owed by Mesopotamia to Great Britain, in respect of all capital works handed over, including railways, ports, electrical and mechanical plant and bridges. Mesopotamia would not be able to pay the debt charges for some years as there was no surplus revenue available, and the revenue from oil would not start coming in for about five years. But on the other hand, there was at present no income tax, which might produce a considerable revenue.2. Sir Arnold Wilson explained the terms of a proposition for the acquisition of the railway system of Mesopotamia, which he had been empowered to make on behalf of Messrs. Strick, Scott and Co. and Messrs. Pearsons.Briefly, his proposals were as follows : (1.) Capital &apos;1,000,000/. debentures to be issued by Messrs. Strick, Scott and Co. andMessrs. Pearsons jointly. 3,000,000/. 9 per cent, preference shares guaranteed as to 6 per cent.by the Arab and British Governments. 2,000,000/. ordinary shares to be issued to the Arab Government in payment for the capital assets taken over.(2.) The group he represented would be prepared to spend immediately up to 250,000/. on improvements.(3.) No other railways to be constructed in Mesopotamia without the consent of his group, and if it were decided to complete the Haifa-Hit railway the works should be undertaken by them. This would serve to obviate all competition and make for economy and efficient working.Sir Arnold Wilson explained that 100 miles of the Haifa-Hit railway line were built, and that the total distance would be about 550 miles. The project should be regarded on its merits as a commercial undertaking and not from the point of view of its value as a pipe-line. Regarded solely from the latter point of view, the capital expenditure necessary was prohibitive, and further there was another outlet for oil via Baghdad and Alexandretta.Answering questions by Sir G. Barstow, Sir Arnold Wilson said his groups would not be prepared to give any preference to the shares issued to the Arab Government, as all the new capital would have to have preference. He further stated that they would not be prepared to take a lease of the railway system, for in its present incomplete condition its value was only about one-third of the total value of the railway when constructed, and it would thus be tantamount to making the
Note by Sir George Barstow.Mesopotamia: Note on Railways.General Atkinson explained the railway system of Mesopotamia, which is thoroughly unsatisfactory.(a.) There are three different gauges. (The old Baghdad line, broad gauge; the Basra-Baghdad and Kut-Baghdad, metre gauge; and Baghdad-Fallujah, 2 ft. 6 in. gauge.)(b.) Two sets of branches, which compete with one another, viz., Basra-Baghdad, which competes with Baghdad-Kut, and is not defensible against Arab raids; and the two lines from Baghdad towards Mosul, one via Kirkuk and one via the Tigris (also very liable to raids).(c.) The Khanaqin line towards Persia requires relaying and a diversion via. Khanaqin town, in order to meet requirements of the group interested in Persian railway projects.Sir A. T. Wilson then called to explain his offer, which has already been before you.The scheme of finance contemplated by his group (Strick, Scott and Co. and Pearsons) is to raise 1,000,000/. debentures.3,000,000/. 9 per cent, preference, guaranteed as to 6 per cent, by arab and British Governments. And pay for the line with 2,000,000/. ordinary shares, to be held by theArab Government.The offer is clearly unacceptable. The Arab Government would get for their property only the ultimate (and remote) prospect of dividends on the ordinary stock, and would have to assume the liability to pay 180,000/. a year on the prefer-ence shares. They would not even have voting control by reason of their interest in the ordinary shares; but the whole liability in the case of inefficient management, &amp;c, would fall on them. *I put it to Sir A. T. Wilson, and he agreed that his argument practically amounted to saying that the line is derelict, and that it would indirectly pay the Arab Government to pay for its being kept as a going concern.Although I think it would be very desirable to get the railway run by a private commercial enterprise, and not as a State railway, I am sure better terms must be offered, and asked Sir A. T. Wilson what would be his best offer to purchase for cash, and also whether his group would be prepared to lease the railway. We may hear further as to this.As the offer of the group had been rejected by the Secretary of State already, there was no business to be done in any case, and the visit was for the purpose merely of explanation.The capital expenditure required on the railway line in 1921-22 is estimated by General Atkinson at 325,000/., the first part of a scheme of reconstruction and reconditioning the line, which may required million pounds.   Sir A. T. Wilson &apos; indicated that even the expenditure of 325,000/. would not improve the group&apos;sArab Government a present of twice the present value of the railway. He could not, without referring to London, state whether they would be prepared to offer a sum in cash for the whole of the assets, but any such sum would be considerably under 2 million pounds.Finally, he said that Mr. Churchill had intimated that the present was not a propitious moment for the State to hand over the railway to a private concern, and that in any case the offer was not such as was likely to be accepted.Sir G. Barstotw expressed the view that, although he personally was opposed to the State management of railways, the terms of the offer would be quite unaccept-able to the Arab Government, and that it appeared to be assumed that it would be worth the while of that Government to pay Messrs. Strick, Scott and Co. and Messrs. Pearsons in order to have a railway running at all. The matter could not at present be carried further in view of Mr. Churchill&apos;s decision.
offer for the railway a year hence, as the rest of the line would have been depreciating by an equal amount.The 325,000/. covers certain orders for locomotives and waggons, and a removal of workshops from Shaiba to Baghdad. Probably only a small part of the payment for locomotives will be required in 1921-22, even if orders were given at once.To relieve the administration of the liability for finding fresh capital for the railway, it would be desirable to strike a bargain with private enterprise as early as possible. But this can hardly be before the political settlement, and in any case the present offer is not good enough.Note by the Secretary of State.I think it would be unwise to sell our railways at the present moment, especially if we have to offer a guarantee, as demanded by Sir A. T. Wilson. This simply means that if things turn out well, he takes the profit, and if there is another rebel-lion we pay the loss. Should we get through the summer quietly, and our Arab policy prove a success, much more advantageous offers could be looked for than are now justified.   Meanwhile, it is essential to keep the railways in working order.Incidentally, I may observe that the sale of the Mesopotamian railways to Sir A. T. Wilson&apos;s company a few months after this gentleman had ceased to be Governor of the country would raise Parliamentary issues of an embarrassing kind.(Initialled)        W. S. 0.April 2, 1921.
SECTION III.-PALESTINE.Appendix 17.-Palestine: Political and Military.FIRST MEETING OF THE PALESTINE POLITICAL AND military committee.March 17, 1921.Present:The Rt. Hon. Winston Spencer Churchill, M.P. (Chairman).The Rt. Hon. Sir Herbert Samuel, G.B.E.Lieutenant-General Sir Walter Congreve, V.C., K.C.B.Air-Marshal Sir H. M. Trenchard, Bart., K.C.B., D.S.O.General Sir P. P. de B. Radcliffe, K.C.M.G., C.B., D.S.O.Air-Vice-Marshal Sir G. Salmond, K.C.M.G., &amp;c.J. B. Crosland, Esq.W. H. Deedes, Esq., C.M.G., D.S.O.Colonel C. R. Newman.Colonel B. H. S. Waters Taylor, C.B.E.Colonel T. E. Lawrence.Major H. W. Young, D.S.O.Miss Bell, C.B.E.Major the Hon. F. R. Somerset.Captain F. G. Peake.R. D. Badcock, M.C. (Secretary).The Chairman stated that the Committee had to discuss the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Palestine under two aspects : 1. The general and external aspect as affected by the policy in Mesopotamia andArabia, both now and in the future. 2. The local development of Palestine, with particular reference to the Zionistquestion.He asked Major Young to read out the departmental point of view which had been arrived at after considerable discussion in London (Appendix 2). After Major Young had read the report, Sir Herbert Samuel observed that he would be glad of an opportunity to read the paper. He agreed that it was necessary that Trans-Jordania should be regarded as territory administered on different lines from Palestine, partly owing to the question of Zionism. Nevertheless, this area was included under the British mandate, and should not, in his opinion, be regarded as an independent Arab State. The main question of the moment was to deal with the Sherif Abdullah, who was now at Amman, and who still regarded the Sherif Feisal as the King of Syria, including Trans-Jordania, with his capital at Damascus. It was necessary for us to combine our Sherifian with our mandatory policy. He trusted&apos; that it would be possible to effect this combination, but at present the two policies overlapped. Above all it was necessary that it should not be an unworkable combination.  He submitted that there were four points to be borne in mind :  .1. Assuming that the Sherif Abdullah were supported by His Majesty&apos;s Government, we might not be sufficiently strong to ensure that no anti-French campaign should emanate from Trans-Jordania, which was at present the base of this agitation. Letters had been sent by the Sherif Abdullah to all the Sheikhs to combine against the French. There was evidence of close contact with Mustafa Kemah and other influences in Damascus hostile to the French, and if this state of affairs were to continue it could not fail to jeopardise the relations between Palestine and Syria, and thereby effect the relations between Great Britain and France.2. There was some probability of controversy in Palestine for some years on the question of Zionism, and it was possible that the Sherif might encourage agitation and thus prove a danger.
3. Bad government in Trans-Jordania would directly affect Palestine, as it would provide no security against raids across the Jordan.4. A dual Government in Trans-Jordania, deriving its authority both from the High Commissioner in Palestine and from a Sherif, might not work, owing to the dual control.The Chairman hoped that the decision which had been arrived at in previous meetings of the Conference with regard to Mesopotamia might prove the solution for Trans-Jordania. It had seemed best to support the Sherifian cause; in fact no other alternative presented itself. He felt that it would be a danger to attempt to harness the strong Arab movement by placing a local candidate at the head of the Administration in Trans-Jordania, thereby keeping the Sherifian movement under a cloud. The French view was that by supporting the Sherif we were building up, like Frankenstein, a monster which would eventually devour us. This was a question of principle, and after very close consideration and discussion with Sir Percy Cox and his staff it had been unanimously agreed that no other course presented itself. It seemed inevitable in these circumstances that we should adopt a policy elsewhere which would harmonise with our Mesopotamian policy. To support the Sherif in Iraq and not in Trans-Jordania would be courting trouble, especially if, by subsidis-ing King Hussein, and ensuring, by a grant to Ibn Saud, that he refrained from attacking the Hedjaz, we could obtain general peace and prosperity in Arabia. If we were to curb the activities of Abdullah, while allowing him to remain in Trans-Jordania, we must obtain the goodwill of the Sherifian family and place them as a whole under an obligation to His Majesty&apos;s Government in one sphere or another. If it was possible to guarantee that there would be no anti-Zionist disturbances our point would be gained, but to do so the Arab leader in Trans-Jordania must be given support either in money or troops. Abdullah&apos;s moral influence was of great importance. The objections to garrisoning Trans-Jordania were, on the one hand, that the force might either be more than we could afford financially, or alternatively, so small as to be unsafe. We must make more bricks with less straw. He hoped that General Congreve would be able to reduce the number of troops in Palestine as well as to keep some across the Jordan. The question to be decided was the minimum strength of the force required, on the assumption that we were able to make satisfac-tory arrangements with Abdullah, with whom it would probably be necessary to discuss the question. He did not share the fear of Sir Herbert Samuel in regard to dual control.Sir Herbert Samuel entirely agreed with the Chairman that it was in the best interests of British policy that we should support the Sherif, and moreover he considered that we were definitely pledged to this during the war, and that there could be no question of our failing to honour our word. He considered that the French had made a great mistake in their policy in Syria by departing from these principles. He concurred in the necessity of differentiating between the Administra-tions in Palestine and Trans-Jordania, and he had never suggested any other policy. He believed that that was also desired by the inhabitants of Trans-Jordania. He considered that if His Majesty&apos;s Government were to undertake to guarantee the French against hostile agitation from Trans-Jordania, it was indispensable for us to have troops there. He was uncertain as to the desirability of appointing Abdullah as ruler for the various reasons which he had mentioned previously, and he felt that it was essential that a definite decision should be arrived at as to the relations between the two authorities in Trans-Jordania before discussing the matter with the Sherif.In reply to the Chairman, Colonel Lawrence stated that it was quite conceivable (in fact he had heard it from French officials) that French policy might change, and that provided they could arrange matters with Abdullah, he might be instated as ruler in Damascus. This being so, it would be difficult for us, if we had by our support given Abdullah considerable power in Trans-Jordania, to keep that area free of French influence, and he would regret the existence of a Franco-Arab State on the eastern boundary of Palestine. He trusted that in four or five years, under the influence of a just policy, the opposition to Zionism would have decreased, if it had not entirely disappeared, and it was his view that it would be preferable to use Trans-Jordania as a safety valve, by appointing a ruler on whom he could bring pressure to bear, to check anti-Zionism. The ideal would be a person who was not too powerful, and who was not an inhabitant of Trans-Jordania, but who relied upon His Majesty&apos;s Government for the retention of his office.   He thought that the
question of raids which had been mentioned by Sir Herbert Samuel could best be solved by the creation of a good system of government east of the Jordan. He submitted that we should not allow our view to be focussed solely on our Western policy in Trans-Jordania, but also that we should look eastward, towards Mesopotamia, and towards the intervening desert and its nomad inhabitants. Sherif Abdullah, by reason of his position and lineage, possessed very considerable power for good or harm over the tribesmen. This would not be the case with a local towns-man who was the only other alternative. He thought that the appointment should be that of a governor, and that it should be made by the High Commissioner for Palestine, who would, of course, consult His Majesty&apos;s Government. There should be no connection with the Hedjaz, the influence of which he trusted would be confined to the two Holy Cities. The sons of King Hussein were rarely in agreement with him, though the family held together as long as they were apart.Major Young agreed with Colonel Lawrence that the situation would be difficult if the French offered the throne of Syria to a man who had meanwhile become a quasi-British subject. He was in favour of an alternative to Abdullah, if it were possible to find one.Colonel Lawrence thought that if Sherif Abdullah proved that he could behave well in Trans-Jordania both to the French and to the British his subsequent appoint-ment to Damascus would appear less objectionable to the French.In reply to a question from the Chairman, Major Somerset stated that he thought a more pressing question was (in the event of the Sherif Abdullah not being chosen) the means by which we were to get rid of him, assuming that he decided to reside at Amman, in which case it would be impossible to prevent him conducting an anti-French campaign if he chose to do so.General Comgreve reminded the Chairman that a statement by M. de Caix had recently been published, in which he mentioned that the French might possibly retire to the Lebanon. This would alter the situation considerably.Neither Sir Herbert Samuel nor Colonel Lawrence thought that the French would really do this.In reply to an observation by Mr. Deedes, the Chairman stated that he hoped that support of Abdullah would be based on mutual interests, though he fully realised that miscreants from Palestine would always be able to find refuge in Trans-Jordania.Mr. Deedes was opposed to the appointment of Sherif Abdullah, but if the issue was prejudiced by his presence in Amman, the only course was to accept his appoint-ment as a fait accompli.In reply to the Chairman, Major Somerset said that it would in his opinion be impossible to get rid of Abdullah in the event of his not being appointed, or of his refusing to agree to the conditions of the appointment.The Chairman agreed with Sir Herbert Samuel that provided Sherif Abdullah could be made-amenable to British policy by a general understanding with his family, which included the appointment of one of its members to the throne of Iraq, a subsidy to King Hussein, and a guarantee to restrain Ibn&apos;Saud, it might be possible, with the help of a small force, to enable him to set up a stable Government on the understand-ing that he used his influence to prevent anti-French and anti-Zionist propaganda in Trans-Jordania.Major Somerset thought that, assuming that we possessed the good-will of Abdullah and of the local population, it woufd be sufficient from the political point of view, if one squadron of cavalry were garrisoned at Amman, though he was aware that General Congreve considered, from the military point of view, that this was not sufficient.General Congreve pointed out that during the war Colonel Lawrence had found it possible to raise a force of 22,000 men against the Turks in Trans-Jordania. Seeing that a similar force might conceivably be turned against us now, and in order to guarantee immunity to the French, to quell raids, and to maintain our prestige, he estimated the minimum garrison for Trans-Jordania at one battalion of infantry, two squadrons of cavalry, and two guns. The railway from Semakh to Deraa not being under our control, the only line of communications lay along thirty miles of[6117] &apos; P
road through difficult country, which was admirably suited to guerilla warfare. He * agreed with Sir Herbert Samuel that it might be possible for the troops to live on the country to a large extent, but it would, nevertheless, be necessary for him to have a means of supply. He pointed out the difficulty in Palestine, where it was necessary for him to keep garrisons at such widely separated posts as Roshpina, Semakh, Beisan and Jerusalem, for which, under his new establishment, he would only have 5,000 fighting troops available. It was proposed to substitute British for Indian troops in Palestine, and the rate of sickness among the former in the unhealthy country of the Jordan valley was considerable. He was aware that the difficulty of unhealthy stations would be overcome if it were decided to send troops across the Jordan, but he estimated that he would require two more battalions or their equivalent. So long as he was responsible for Palestine he must have additional troops, in the event of it being decided to despatch a garrison to Trans-Jordania. It might, however, be possible to effect some reduction in the total, especially in view of the proposed formation of a defence force.The British reserve in Egypt was a factor in the situation, and he knew that the Chairman appreciated the General Staff view that British battalions must so far as possible be maintained.In reply to a question by the Chairman, Mr. Crosland stated that the cost of a British battalion in &quot;Palestine was only half as much again as&apos; that of an Indian battalion, whereas in Mesopotamia it was double.General Radclijfe thought that in view of the reduction of British forces in the Black Sea, Mesopotamia and Constantinople it might be possible to alter the previous decision not to occupy Trans-Jordania. From the point of mew of the Imperial General Staff, troops were well placed in Palestine as they would be available there to form a strategic reserve for the east.In reply to a question by the Chairman, A ir-Marshal Trenchard stated that assuming that there was no general hostility to our policy in Trans-Jordania it might be possible to place aerodromes at Amman, Kerak and Irbid, with small supplies of petrol at each. The squadron in Palestine, which could: be reinforced by one from Egypt if necessary, could fly to these aerodromes at stated intervals or when required, and this force might perhaps be sufficient to supplement a smaller garrison, besides having a good moral effect in restraining any turbulent elements. Aeroplanes were not doing very much in Palestine at present, but he knew that General Congreve would support him when he stated that they had proved a very valuable factor in the fighting at Semakh in the past.Colonel Lawrence was of opinion that the whole situation largely depended upon the military position.  There were three possible alternatives (a.) The appointment of Sherif Abdullah.  For this it was necessary to obtain his good-will.(&amp;.) The appointment of a local governor with the good-will of Sherif Abdullah.who would himself withdraw from the territory. (c.) The despatch of a military expedition to eject Sherif Abdullah.In regard to (a), he thought that the appointment of a loyal and amenable Sherif, but an inactive one, was unobjectionable. He felt that neither we nor Sherif Abdullah were strong enough at present to hold Trans-Jordania without assistance from the uLher.Sir Herbert Samuel agreed, though he felt some uneasiness that if the Sherif were appointed it might prove difficult to restrain him. He considered that alterna-tive (c) was out of the question.The Chairman requested General Congreve to preside over a military committee for Palestine (Appendix 18), which should consider and submit a report on alterna-tives (a) and (b) mentioned by Colcnel Lawrence. They should also recommend the minimum garrison which would then be needed for Palestine and Trans-Jordania together, bearing in mind the support which could be given by the Air Force, and the possible relief due to the creation of a defence force. He reminded the Committee of the possibility of the use of reserves drawn from Egypt, in the event of emergency, and thought it might be possible to effect certain economies in the expenditure on labour and administrative services in the garrison of Palestine. Certain relics of the past still remained as a financial burden. If these economies were effected, it might be possible to obtain sanction for an increase in establishment sufficient to justify the
despatch and maintenance of a small garrison for Trans-Jordania. He would ask Sir Herbert Samuel to be present when questions of policy and of the defence force were discussed.At the request of Sir Herbert Samuel he directed that this Committee should subsequently enquire into and report upon the most efficient and economical method of raising and maintaining the proposed defence force in Palestine (Appendix 20).SECOND MEETING OF THE PALESTINE POLITICAL AND military committee.March 18, 1921.Present:The Rt. Lion. Winston Spencer Churchill, M.P. (Chairman).The Rt. Hon. Sir Herbert Samuel, G.B.E.Lieutenant-General Sir Walter Congreve, Y.C., K.C.B.General Sir P. P. de B. Radcliffe, K.C.M.G., C.B., D.S.O.Air-Vice-Marshal Sir G. Salmond, K.C.MLG., &amp;c.J. B. Crosland, Esq.W. H. Deedes, Esq., C.M.G., D.S.O.Colonel C. R. Newman.Colonel B. H. S. Waters Taylor, C.B.E.Colonel T. E. Lawrence.Major H. W. Young, D.S.O.   -Miss Bell, C.B.E.Major the Hon. F. R. Somerset.Captain F. G. Peake.R. D. Badcock, M.C. (Secretary).The Chairman read the report of the Palestine Military Committee, formed under the presidency of Lieutenant-General Sir Walter Congreve (Appendix 18).In&apos;reply to a question by the Chairman, General Radcliffe said that he fully realised the argument in favour of despatching troops to Trans-Jordania, where it was indeed difficult to maintain order, or to execute our policy in their absence. In the past the General Staff had been unable to agree to this-occupation, owing to the fact that no troops were available. Owing to various reductions throughout the world, notably in Mesopotamia, Constantinople and the Black Sea, he considered that this difficulty might now be overcome, and it remained, purely a financial question. He was quite prepared to support the suggestion.Sir Herbert Samuel called attention to a statement in the report as to the with-drawal of troops at some future date. Although he agreed with the suggestion of the Chairman at the previous meeting that the position should be reviewed at the end of a period of six months, he emphasised that it would not be a case of with-drawal from Trans-Jordania, but merely of a reduction of the total British garrison in Palestine and Trans-Jordania, owing to the creation of the local defence force which was being formed in the new financial year, and which was being paid for from the revenue of Palestine. He was convinced that it would be a fatal error for our troops not to remain across the Jordan when they had once been despatched there. The inhabitants had already had three experiences of this nature: firstly, the Amman operations in the early spring of 1918; secondly, the Es Salt raid in the late spring of 1918; and thirdly, when he himself had gone over to Trans-Jordania in August 1920. It was true that he had never indicated that troops would be sent to Trans-Jordania, but the people had anticipated the effective exercise of British influence. On the first two occasions the inhabitants had given play to their pro-British sentiments on the entry of our forces, and on the return of the Turks after a lapse of a few days they were very hardly treated. As a result of these instances our prestige had fallen considerably, and he could not too strongly urge the certainty that public opinion would be very adversely affected if we now repeated this policy. Moreover, he felt sure that if Sherif Abdullah remained in Trans-Jordania it would be essential for us to maintain troops to support our position; otherwise we could not be sure that there would not be an anti-French and an anti-Palestine movements[6117] - P 2
there. He considered that the formation of a local force in Trans-Jordania would he of great assistance in the maintenance of public order, though perhaps financial limitations would prevent the adoption, for the present, of so large a scheme as that proposed by Captain Peake. The matter would receive his consideration, and he felt sure that a local force would be very valuable in support of the administration, in such matters as the collection of taxes, provided it had a stiffening of British troops.The Chairman stated that he hoped he would be able to show a reduction on the Palestine garrison corresponding to the increase involved in garrisoning Trans-Jordania. He looked for assistance in this connection to reductions under the head of charges for labour. In reply to General Congreve, he said that he would do his utmost to obtain shipping for the troops which were awaiting embarkation. He felt that it was most important that he should obtain sanction for the despatch of the troops before his meeting with Sherif Abdullah in Jerusalem on the 28th. He proposed to draft a telegram urging this on the assumption that either Sherif Abdullah or a local candidate supported by him would be appointed Governor. He proposed to say that in order to carry out British policy, to prevent anti-French and -pro-Sherifian propaganda, and to reopen the Hedjaz railway, thus re-establishing the pilgrimage to Mecca and providing King Hussein with an income from other than British sources, it was agreed that it was essential to maintain troops east of the river. In these circumstances he was unable to effect a further saving beyond the heavy reduction from 25,000 to 7,000 which had already been made by the General Officer Commanding. It would therefore be necessary temporarily to increase the garrison by two battalions or their equivalent, but in view of the fact that a local defence force was being created by the Administration of Palestine, it had been agreed that the position should be reviewed at the end of six months, when he was hopeful of further reductions. Against this temporary increase he trusted that it would be possible by a careful scrutiny of arrears and terminal charges to meet the additional expense involved. On Mr. Crosland&apos;s estimate the cost of the Palestine garrison, including Trans-Jordania, should not exceed 2 million pounds in 1922-23, and he felt sure that the report which he had recently seen in Reuter that the Palestine garrison cost 7 millions per annum was incorrect. He pointed out that it was infinitely more likely that a reduction would be effected at an early-date if good order were maintained during the present difficult period while the local defence force was being formed. Once it had been trained it would be fit to replace the permanent garrison to some extent, and therefore a small additional expenditure for the first six months might prove in the long run to be an economy. In view of the fact that Sir Herbert Samuel demurred to giving an undertaking to reduce the cost of the garrison in 1922-23 to 1,500,000/. he would not press the point, but he trusted that this reduction would be found possible.Sir Herbert Samuel observed that the Military Committee had stated that it might be possible to replace one Indian battalion at the end of six months by the defence force. Although he did not wish to rate too highly the value of local forces, he thought the 1,200 local men whom it was proposed to recruit during the financial year of 1921-22 ought to be able to replace more than one Indian battalion, which, at General Congreve&apos;s estimate, would be approximately 500 strong.General Congreve was inclined to agree, though he pointed out that it would be difficult to utilise the Arab battalion, owing to the fact that politically it would be impossible to station it in the strategic posts in Northern Palestine, where troops were most required.Sir Herbert Samuel replied that although he fully agreed that there were certain places where it would be inadvisable to station Arab troops, notably at Nablus, where he thought that a company of British troops should always be maintained; neverthe-less in general he was quite prepared for them to be stationed wherever General Congreve required them.General Congreve agreed that in the circumstances it might be possible to reduce the British garrison by the equivalent of two battalions in October next. He deprecated capital expenditure being incurred: on the construction of expensive barracks and cantonments until it was definitely decided what the permanent garri-son of the future was to be. It would no doubt be necessary to provide huts at Amman, and the cost of these would have to be estimated. The more widely troops were distributed, the more expensive was their maintenance.
In reply to a question by the Chairman, Mr. Crosland stated that a regiment of cavalry was slightly cheaper than one battalion of infantry, and Major Somerset expressed the opinion that cavalry would be more valuable in Trans-Jordania than infantry, particularly as it would be difficult to move infantry about the country m hot weather.The Chairman thought that the estimated annual cost per man of the troops was somewhat high, and that it should not be more than 400Z.Sir Herbert Samuel reminded the Chairman that the garrison in Palestine was not merely intended to maintain order in that country, but should be regarded as an Imperial reserve and as a protection for the Suez Canal.The Chairman agreed that our forces in Egypt and Palestine should support each other reciprocally. He hoped that Mr. Crosland would shortly receive a reply to HTfe telegram to the War Office, enquiring what proportion of the 30 million pounds of the vote for the Middle East was allotted to Palestine. He hoped to show in the future that this expenditure would be reduced from 30 millions to approximately 8 millions in 1922-23, of which 5 or 6 millions would be the cost of the force in Mesopotamia and the remainder of that in Palestine.Appendix 18. Palestine: Military.FIRST MEETING OF THE PALESTINE MILITARY COMMITTEE.March 17, 1921.President:Lieutenant-General Sir W. Congreve.Members:Major-General Sir P. P. de B. Radcliffe.Air-Vice-Marshal Sir G. Salmond.Mr. W. H. Deedes.Colonel-Commandant Newman.Colonel T. E. Lawrence.Major the Hon. F. R. Somerset.Captain Peake.Secretary:Lieutenant-Colonel B. H. Waters Taylor.The Committee proceeded on the assuption that either Abdullah or his nominee both friendly to the Imperial Government, is appointed Governor of Trans-Jordania with the general consent of the inhabitants, and on this assumption considered what should be the adequate garrison.  .&apos; 1. It was agreed that the minimum garrison necessary for Trans-Jordania would be 1 battalion infantry, 2 squadrons cavalry, 1 section artillery,and that this force should be stationed at Amman. The role of the force would not be passive but active; the cavalry patrolling the country and supporting the gendarmerie on occasions where situations arose outside their capacity, the infantry supporting the cavalry and holding the cantonments. The Committee considered tlie garrison strong enough to- quell any element of the population that might be unfriendly to the Government.2. A statement and table is attached, showing: Column A. Proposed distribution of the 7,000 ration strength.Column B. Reduction necessary if the Trans-Jordania garrison is to befound with the addition of only one extra battalion or regiment.(Annexure I.)
3. The Air-Vice-Marshal considered the provision of aerodromes at Amman, Irbid and Kerak necessary, and handed in his scheme for the co-operation of R.A.F. with the local forces.  (Annexure II.)4. The Committee pointed out the urgent necessity for the repair of the road from Ghoraniyeh Bridge to Amman to make it passable for motor transport, the railway being at present too uncertain to rely upon as it is not in our hands. The estimated cost of repairs for this road was 8,000/.5. Although it was hoped that the Imperial Garrison could be reduced or even completely withdrawn in the near future, it was recognised that this must depend on the progress achieved by the local Government and that no fixed date could be arrived at.Captain Peake handed in his scheme for the composition strength and cost of the local forces that he considered necessary on the withdrawal of the Imperial Forces.  (Annexure III.)Annexure I.1. The disposition of troops in Palestine on the 7,000 ration strength basis is shown in Column A.2. The disposition of troops proposed for Palestine, if present garrison is increased by one battalion only and the Trans-Jordania garrison found from this garrison, is shown in Column B.It will be seen that the garrison in North Palestine is unduly reduced, especially reserves at Jenin and Nazareth, and detachments would have to be withdrawn from certain places Nablus, Mizpah, for instance considered of importance by the Civil Government.These considerations do not include the provision of escorts on the Ghoraniyeh-Amman road, for which armoured cars in the case of motor convoys, and infantry and cavalry in the case of mixed convoys, would have to be drawn from the Palestine garrison in the case of the railway being out of action.It is considered that, to ensure reasonable safety in Palestine and to provide the Trans-Jordanian garrison, an addition to the present garrison of either 1  battalion  infantry,   1  regiment  cavalry  (preferable  Indian),  or 2 battalions infantry (1 battalion Indian), is necessary.Statement of Distribution of Troops, Palestine.

Appendix 19, Trans-Jordania.FIRST CONVERSATION ON TRANS-JORDANIA, HELD AT government house, JERUSALFM, MARCH 28, 1921.Present:The Right Hon. W. S. Churchill, M.P., Secretary of State for the Colonies.Sir Herbert Samuel.Mr. Deedes.Colonel Lawrence.Major Young.H.H. Emir Abdullah.Auni Abdul Hadi.Mr. Churchill said that he had just taken&quot; over the new Middle East Department of the Colonial Office and was endeavouring to substitute a policy viewed and initiated as a whole for what he feared might have conveyed the impression of a want of co-ordination in British policy in the Arab areas of the Middle East since the armistice.He wished to revert to the original policy of supporting Arab nationality on constructive lines, using the Sherifian family as a medium. There were, however, parts of the Arab world in which His Majesty&apos;s Government were not able to carry out this policy, owing to the decisions of the Allies and to promises made to third parties.These parts were Syria and Palestine west of the Jordan.He would like to see the Sherifian family in a predominant position in the whole of the Arab countries, so far as this was compatible with the above exceptions, but it was impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to impose a Sherifian regime on the various Arab populations by force.For example, it was obvious that Ibn Saoud in his present mood would not accept any form of Sherifian suzerainty, nor, as far as was known, would the Imam or the Idrisi. The best help that His Majesty&apos;s Government could give to King Hussein as regards Ibn Saoud and the Idrisi was to make it clear to them that they did not, and would not, countenance any aggression on their part against the Hedjaz. He proposed to ensure this by paying these rulers a monthly subsidy conditional upon their maintaining neutrality. At the same time he intended to advise the Cabinet to agree to the payment of a substantial allowance to King&apos;Hussein to enable him to maintain internal order and to develop the amenities of his country for pilgrimage traffic.With regard to Mesopotamia, His Majesty&apos;s Government had promised the people to consider their wishes in the selection of their future form of government and the choice of a ruler. This did not bind His Majesty&apos;s Government to accept whatever choice they made. While large armies and large sums of money were being provided by Great Britain it was clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not afford to remain entirely indifferent. At the same time they were prevented by their pledges from imposing a nominee of their own as ruler of the country. There were some Mesopotamians who were putting forward the Emir Feisal as a candidate for the throne. His election would be agreeable to His Majesty&apos;s Government, and so far as they could, consistently with their undertakings to the inhabitants, they would support his claims.Sir Percy Cox, the High Commissioner of Mesopotamia, who had recently attended the Conference at Cairo, had every hope of Feisal being selected by-Mesopotamia,At the same time there wrere other local candidates : the Naqib of Baghdad; Said Talib; the Sheikh of Mohammerah; Ibn Saoud himself, all of whom had to be reckoned with.There were also the French, who were at present very angry with Feisal, and would be equally with His Majesty&apos;s Government if they appeared to be deliberately imposing him upon the people of Mesopotamia.He felt sure that the Emir Abdullah, as an experienced politician, would under-stand the difficulty of any very direct action being taken.[6117] Q
At the same time, if the people of Mesopotamia were to choose Feisal, it would be quite easy to explain to the French that in accordance with their previous pledges His Majesty&apos;s Government were bound to accept him.Feisal himself had been informed of the proposed policy and was now on his way from London to Jeddah.It was hoped and expected that, as a result of letters that might pass between him and his father on the one side, and members of the Sherifian party on the other, he would eventually be acclaimed by the general voice of the Mesopotamian people. It might, of course, be otherwise. This would be embarrassing and would militate against the general success of the policy which was now under contemplation.He felt that it would strengthen Feisal if the Sherifian party in Mesopotamia knew that the Emir Abdullah supported his candidature. He would be glad to hear the Emir&apos;s views on the general policy as outlined so far, after which he hoped to discuss further questions in which he was interested.The Emir said that he fully understood and appreciated the fact that His Majesty&apos;s Government were taking up the Arab question as a whole. He also understood that they realised.that success could best be reached by reverting to their original policy of working through the Sherifian family.He accepted the fact that the peace settlement and their promise to third parties did not leave Great Britain free to act in Syria and in Western Palestine.He wished to express his cordial thanks to Mr. Churchill for having adopted this policy. At the same time he wished to make it clear that the Sherifian family did not regard the Arab question merely as a personal one. They regarded them-selves more in the light of spokesmen for the whole of the Arab nation. The first and most important point to them was the future of the peninsula of Arabia, the home of the Arab race.He did not quite understand what would be the constitutional position of Ibn Saoud and the Idrisi; were they to be allowed to regard themselves as entirely inde-pendent or were they to be under British protection 1 If they were to be independent he did not quite see how His Majesty&apos;s Government would be able to ensure that they should refrain from hostile action against the Hedjaz. Arab politics were very largely dominated by personalities. Did His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to per-petuate distinctions which had been called into existence by these personalities or were they prepared to regard these distinctions as merely temporary?Mr. Churchill said that His Majesty&apos;s, Government must recognise existing facts. They must feel their way, as their powers were limited. Ibn Saoud, for example, was very strong-much stronger than King Hussein. It was impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to compel Ibn Saoud they could only hope to influence him.It was a necessary corollary to the policy now suggested that if the other inde-pendent rulers of Arabia at any time agreed to acknowledge the suzerainty of the Hedjaz His Majesty&apos;s Government would welcome their doing so.The Emir said that he did not suggest for a moment that Ibn Saoud should be asked to accept the suzerainty of King Hussein, but he was not confident that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be able to restrain him.Mr. Churchill replied that the only way to restrain Ibn Saoud was to make friends with him; to make him dependent upon His M&apos;ajesty&apos;s Government; to provide him with money to help him to keep order and to assert his authority; and to make it quite clear to him that British assistance and support were conditional upon his refraining from aggression against the Hedjaz.The Emir said that, of course, Ibn Saoud would be quite helpless without British support. The Hedjaz would never attack Nejd. All they wished for was peace and quiet. . &apos;     .He fully realised that His Majesty&apos;s Government were now offering to spend a large sum of money, mainly for the benefit of the Hedjaz, and he felt sure that so long as it was made quite clear to Ihn Saoud that British assistance was conditional on his refraining from aggression the Hedjaz had nothing to fear.With regard to Mesopotamia he had no personal feeling.It was his brother Feisal who had arranged that he should be proclaimed King of Mesopotamia. He himself had not only had no part in this arrangement, but had pointed out to his brother that he was unwise in taking a step which could only embarrass His Majesty&apos;s Government.
He was delighted with the policy as outlined for Mesopotamia and would co-operate in every way towards making it a success.Mr. Churchill mentioned that the Emir Feisal had taken the same line when the matter was discussed with him in London and had disclaimed any desire to stand in his brothers way. He thought that this attitude reflected great credit on Feisal and Abdullah alike.Turning to Trans-Jordania, he said that His Majesty&apos;s Government were responsible for this area under a mandate given them by the Allied Powers in the peace settlement with Turkey. They recognised its Arab character, but felt it was too small to stand alone. Economically and geographically it should go with Palestine, and he proposed that it be constituted as an Arab province under an Arab Governor responsible to the High Commissioner for Palestine.He invited the Emir&apos;s views on this suggestion.The Emir said that if he were permitted he would at once say what his own personal view was about the future regime for Trans-Jordania and Palestine.If His Majesty&apos;s Government could agree that there should be an Arab Emir over Palestine and Trans-Jordania in the same relation with the High Commissioner for Palestine as that of the Emir Feisal with the High Commissioner for Mesopo-tamia, he was convinced that the present difficulties as between Arabs and Jews would be most easilv overcome.Mr. Churchill pointed out that as a result of the Allied decisions Palestine was in a different position to Mesopotamia. Palestine had been entrusted to the Administration of the mandatory, whereas Mesopotamia had been provisionally recognised as an independent State. He did not himself think it possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to adopt the Emir&apos;s proposal. They were already too far committed in advance to a different system.The Emir repeated that in his opinion the suggestion that he had made was the best possible to reconcile the Arabs and the Jews.He would very much like to know what British policy really aimed at. Did His Majesty&apos;s Government mean to establish a Jewish kingdom west of the Jordan and to turn out the non-Jewish population? If so, it would be better to tell the Arabs at once and not to keep them in suspense. Mr. Churchill had referred to the depisions of the Allies; these were not, in his opinion, beyond challenge. The Allies appeared to think that men could be cut down and transplanted in the same way as trees.Sir Herbert Samuel interposed that there was no intention either to cut down or to transplant, but only to plant new ones.Mr. Churchill said that there was, in his opinion, a great deal of groundless apprehension among the Arabs in Palestine. They appeared to anticipate that hundreds and thousands of Jews were going to pour into the country in a very short time and dominate the existing population. This was not only not contemplated, but quite impossible. There were at present over 500,000 Moslems in Palestine and not more than 80,000 Jews. Jewish immigration would be a very slow process and the rights of the existing non-Jewish population would be strictly preserved.The Emir replied that his opinion had been invited and that he could only give it.His Majesty&apos;s Government proposed to have his brother Feisal in Mesopotamia with a High Commissioner or a mandate, or whatever term they might like to employ. He felt strongly that a similar regime should be adopted for Palestine and Trans-Jordania.The only alternative that presented itself to his mind was that Trans-Jordania should be cut off from Palestine altogether and combined with Mesopotamia,Though he might have been prepared to suggest a name for an Emir of Palestine and, Trans-Jordania, he could not advise on an Arab Governor for Trans-Jordania alone under the authority of the High Commissioner for Palestine.Mr. Churchill said that he would like to explain a little more fully what the position and responsibilities of the Arab Governor would be.It was suggested that Trans-Jordania should be placed under an Arab Governor, who would recognise British control over his Administration, His Majesty&apos;s Government being the mandatory.[6117] Q 2
His Majesty&apos;s Government would naturally expect him to guarantee that he would abstain from and repress anti-French activities in Trans-Jordania.It was assumed that he would accept British policy in Palestine west of the Jordan.His exact relations with the High Commissioner and the nature of British-Arab control in Trans-Jordania would have to be carefully discussed and laid down.It was considered that British control would have to be real in order to secure the interests of Palestine; to prevent the country being made a source of anxiety to the French; to enable the mandatory to fulfil international obligations, and to ensure good administration, which was necessary not only Tor the sake of the inhabitants, but also to enable the local Government to pay its way.The Arab Governor would be appointed by the High Commissioner for Pales-tine, agreed upon in the first place by him and by the Emir Abdullah as representing the Sherifian family.The chief officials and their principal assistants would be chosen with the approval of the High Commissioner, and all important measures would be subject to his ultimate sanction. Provisions would be agreed upon for the election of Repre-sentative Councils in Trans-Jordania,Trans-Jordania would not be included in the present administrative system of Palestine, and therefore the Zionist clauses of the mandate would not apply. Hebrew would not be made an official language in Trans-Jordania, and the local Government would not be expected to. adopt any measures to promote Jewish immi-gration and colonisation.- It would be necessary to determine the frontier between Trans-Jordania and the Hedjaz and Mesopotamia, and particularly to arrange for the reopening of the TIedjaz Railway, which was of vital importance to the pilgrim traffic upon which the Hedjaz depended for its prestige and prosperity.It would also be advisable to open an air route from Amman to Baghdad, in order to draw Palestine and Mesopotamia more closely together.In order to help the Arab Governor to establish and maintain peaceful conditions His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to put a British force at bis disposal at Amman. This could not be done unless the Arab Governor would make himself responsible for the safety of the line of communication with Palestine. For this purpose, and also for the preservation of order in outlying districts, the Arab Governor would require local forces which His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to help him to organise, equip and maintain.He wished the Emir to understand that he was taking a great responsibility as the new Minister in charge of the Middle East in advising his colleagues to join hands with the Sherifian family. He had been advised by certain other people that this was a very dangerous policy. He had been told that His Majesty^ Government would be better advised to. split up the Arabs into distinct and separate Local Govern-ments. This had been the policy of Rome and of Turkey in the past and appeared to be to some extent the policy of other Powers at the present time. He wished to impress upon the Emir that a very grave choice had to be made within the next few days by His Majesty&apos;s Government, namely, whether they should divide or unite the Arab peoples with whom they had to to deal.The Emir replied that he appreciated and was, much struck by the policy outlined by Mr. Churchill. He still thought that his own suggestion about combining Palestine and Trans-Jordania under an Arab Emir was the best, but he was quite prepared to consider the matter in the light of the new- proposals that had been made. He emphasised that it was impossible for him to give any final&apos; decision without first consulting his father and brother.Mr. Churchill readily accepted this. He added that there was one point which he had not at present discussed and upon which he wished to make a few remarks.The policy now suggested towards the Arabs all hung together and the Emir had been invited to Jerusalem in order that it might be explained to him and his opinion taken, but there was still a portion of the Arab world which had not been mentioned. The French authorities in Syria were not at the moment pursuing a Sherifian policy and it was not for His Majesty&apos;s Government to press them to do so. At the. same time it appeared to him that if an example was set in the British sphere and at the same time His Majesty&apos;s Government could point to the admirable results achieved there by themselves, the French might possibly come round to the British way of thinking.  It was obvious that to this end absolute order should be
Illpreserved on the frontier between Syria and Trans-Jordania; the Arab attitude must be as correct as possible, and every personal effort must be made by the Emir himself to improve his relations with the French.The Emir promised to consider the matter very carefully and asked for a copy of the actual proposals in so far as they related to the future regime in Trans-Jordania.Sir Herbert Samuel said that he wished to take this opportunity of explaining British policy in Palestine. There was no question of setting up a Jewish Govern-ment there. The present administration would, he hoped, continue for many years  with the modification that many more local officials would gradually be employed. All religions would be equally respected. No land would be taken from any Arab, nor would the Moslem religion be touched in any way. The Mandate embodied the terms of the Balfour Declaration in which two distinct promises were made one to the Jews and the other to the Arabs. His,Majesty&apos;s Government were resolutely determined to fulfil both these promises.If the Emir were to make enquiries from his friends in Palestine he would find that no Arab had been treated unjustly and no damage done in any way to Islam by the British Adminstration. On the contrary, schools were being opened all over the country, and the Awkaf was in process of being handed back to a purely Moslem body. He was confident that in thirty or forty years it would be found that exactly the same policy was being pursued. No British High Commissioner, and certainly not himself, would ever countenance harm or injustice being done to the non-Jewish population.With regard to the Emir&apos;s suggestion for the combination of Palestine and Trans-Jordania under one Emir, he was doubtful whether a dual Government of this kind would be a success. At the same time he would be delighted to work hand-in-hand with the proposed Arab Government of Trans-Jordania. Personally he had always been pro-Arab and he much regretted the developments in Syria which led to the expulsion of the Emir Feisal. He had often urged the French, both before and after he had become High Commissioner for Palestine, to come to an agreement with the Emir&apos;s brother.So far as he could speak personally, he was sure that the proposal of His Majesty&apos;s, Government would work easily and well.The Emir thanked the High Commissioner warmly for his statement. He was much relieved at his exposition of&quot; British policy in Palestine. He had himself heard nothing but praise of the High Commissioner and his Administration. His own proposal had not been in any way intended unduly to press Arab claims or to embarrass the High Commissioner, it was only a suggestion, which he still believed to provide the best solution to the temporary difficulties with which both sides were faced.SECOND CONVERSATION ON TRANS-JORDANIA.Present:The Right Hon. W. S. Churchill, M.P., Secretary of State for the Colonies.Sir Herbert Samuel&quot;.Mr. Deedes.Colonel Lawrence.Major Young.H.H. Emir Abdullah.Auni Abdul Hadi.Sir Herbert Samuel said that Trans-Jordania was at present administered as three separate areas. There was no central administration. He thought this wrong, and proposed that it should now be combined into one. The proposal was that an Arab Governor should be selected by the Emir and appointed by the High Commissioner. He would have with him a British Adviser who would assist him to organise his administration.The Emir said that before discussing the proposal he wished to explain how :it was that he had come to Trans-Jordania.  His original intention had been to
preserve the remnant of his brothers kingdom of Syria. After the departure of the Emir Feisal from Damascus no precise information was available in the Hedjaz as to the state of affairs in or the future of Trans-Jordania. Feisal had written to his father and asked him to send someone to take charge of his officials and administration. Almost immediately after this had come the rising in the Hauran. It has been represented as urgently necessary that someone should come from the Fledjaz to.defend Trans-Jordania from attack from the north. King Hussein had not been anxious to send anyone not that he did not care, but he thought that His Majesty&apos;s Government who had promised the independence of the Arabs in all districts other than those under French influence, would themselves take the necessary steps. He did not wish to appear mistrustful of His Majesty&apos;s Government. This had been the reason for the delay.The Emir himself had then told his father that he wished to go in person to Jebel Druze, the Hauran or anywhere else where his presence might be necessary. He had come up to Ma&apos;an where all the leaders of the district had come to him and renewed their allegiance to King Feisal. At their request he had intended to stay to keep his brothers seat warm. He had himself given orders that British officers in Trans-Jordania should be respected. This he had done because he was confident that his Majesty&apos;s Government would not disappoint the hopes which they had themselves encouraged. He then heard unofficially that if he proceeded to Amman all British officers would be withdrawn. This had greatly astonished him, for British officers had not been withdrawn from Damascus when the French came in. He had, however, remained inactive at Ma&apos;an for several weeks. He had. never given an order that any tribe should go out and attack the French or anyone else. He was waiting for the result of the negotiations with Feisal. Feisal was now returning to Jeddah with proposals which would, he thought, be acceptable to King Hussein, but until his father had seen and pronounced upon them it was not in his opinion possible for any definite conclusion to be arrived at.The people of Trans-Jordania had already refrained from anti-French action in Syria and would continue to do so were it not for the large number of exiled Syrians who had settled down among them. He wished to warn Mr. Churchill that whatever decisions might now be taken with regard to the British sphere, anti-French action in Syria itself would continue as long as the French followed their present policy. He did not mean by this that anti-French activities would be encouraged from within the British zone.Mr. Churchill said that His Majesty&apos;s Government were only concerned to see that the French were not annoyed from Trans-Jordania. When the French accused him of fomenting hostility to themselves by his Sherifian policy he wished to be able to reply that the exact contrary was the case. He wished to be able to say that it was precisely because His Majesty&apos;s Government had adopted a Sherifian policy that the Sherif were no longer actively hostile to the French. More especially did he wish to be able to say this while FeisaFs candidature for Mesopotamia hung in the balance.The Emir replied that speaking for himself personally he would guarantee that he would keep Trans-Jordania quiet, as it was at present, until he could show the proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government to King Hussein and to Feisal. He gave his word of honour, which he had kept throughout the war, that there should be no anti-French action. At the same time he was very nervous about French policy. He understood that the French had made peace with the Turks: they were con-concentrating their troops to the south, and they would tighten their hold on the Hauran and possibly the Jebel Druze. Loud appeals would come from Syrians to their relations in the British zone, which it would be impossible to ignore and very difficult not to meet.Mr. Churchill did not entirely share these fears. He thought that the French had withdrawn their troops from Cilicia not in order to concentrate on the Hauran, but with a view to reducing expenditure. He quite realised the Emir&apos;s difficulties and only asked him to do what he could.The Emir felt that he must explain the whole position now so that he might not be blamed afterwards for anything that might happen. French oppression in Syria made the position in Trans-Jordania almost impossible. Replying to ?. question by Mr. Churchill he said that he would rather not have British troops in Trans-Jordania during the month which must elapse before King Hussein had pronounced upon the British proposals,  tie agreed with Sir Herbert Samuel that
in view of the fact that the local gendarmerie had received no pay for three months he would be comparatively helpless without some force behind him. At the same time he did not think the moment had arrived for the despatch of British troops.Mr. Churchill very much appreciated the frank manner in which the Emir had explained his position. He suggested, and the Emir agreed, that he should meet his brother Feisal, preferably at Kantara, as he passed through. Colonel Lawrence would be present at the meeting and would report to him what result had been arrived at.THIRD, CONVERSATION ON TRANS-JORDANIA.Present:The Right Hon. W. S. Churchill, M.P., Secretary of State for the Colonies.Sir Herbert Samuel.Mr; Deedes.Colonel Lawrence.Major Young.H.H. Emir Abdullah.Auni Abdul Hadi.Mr. Churchill explained that he had been carefully considering the Emir&apos;s position since the last conversation and, in view of the great difficulties in the way of his accepting the appointment of an Arab Governor other than himself, at the end of the month, during winch it had been suggested that he should communicate with his father, he had made the following proposals privately to the Emir. He had suggested that the Emir himself should remain in Trans-Jordania for a period of six months to prepare the way for the appointment, with his consent, at the end of that time of an Arab Governor under the High Commissioner. During the six months a British Political Officer would be attached to the Emir as his chief adviser, who would assist him to restore order in Trans-Jordania and to set the revenues of the country on a proper basis. He would be prepared to give the Emir such support in money and troops as was really indispensable for the attainment of this object. In return for this support he would ask the Emir to guarantee that there should be no anti-French or anti-Zionist agitation in the country and that he would co-operate in every way in the establishment of secure conditions under the British mandate. He would also ask him to give every assistance in the opening up of the Trans-Desert route to Mesopotamia, which would be of equal advantage to the British and the Arabs. He would himself do what was in his power to reopen the Hedjaz Railway.The Emir replied that after full consideration he had decided to accept the proposal. He only asked that he might be regarded as a British officer and trusted accordingly. He was grateful to Mr. Churchill for having realised the difficulties of his position, and promised that he would do everything he could to ensure the success of the proposed arrangement. He mentioned that one of the chief difficulties in Trans-Jordania was the presence, there of a number of exiled Syrians, who were naturally very hostile to the French, and asked that, if possible, the French authorities in Syria might be moved to proclaim an amnesty and to allow them to return to their homes. He feared that he might have some difficulty in ensuring that there should be no local disturbances on the Syrian border, as the tribes on the Trans-Jordania side were in the habit of making periodical raids on their neighbours on Syrian territory which had nothing to do with the French being there, but which would undoubtedly be interpreted by the French as action directed against them-selves. Replying to a suggestion by Colonel Lawrence, he agreed that it might be possible to direct the attention of the raiders against their immediate neighbours on the Trans-Jordania side of the frontier, and said that he would endeavour to. secure this.&apos; Mr. Churchill promised that he would do his best to induce the French High Commissioner to proclaim an amnesty at Damascus for the exiled Syrians. He informed the Emir that His Majesty&apos;s Government contemplated the proclamation of a similar amnesty in Baghdad for exiled and fugitive Mesopotamians, and he proposed to suggest to the French that it would be of advantage to all concerned if
the proclamation of the two amnesties coincided. He thanked the Emir for his readiness to help, and assured him that he would be given as far as possible a free hand in the very difficult task which he had undertaken.Letter from Mr. Churchill to General Gouraud.My dear General, En route to Alexandria, Mairch 31, 1921.I am extremely disappointed not to have seen you during my visit to Palestine. Had it been possible for me to have postponed my departure for England I would gladly have done so; but the pressure of my work at home when Parliament is sitting is considerable, and I have already been away for nearly five weeks.I had, however, a valuable and pleasant interview with M. de Caix, to whom at his request I explained the general orientation of our policy. On the whole it is leaning to a Sherifian solution, but of course we shall be guided by the wishes of the people both in Iraq and elsewheraAs regards Trans-Jordania, I am most anxious to give you effective security from raids and annoyance of all kinds. I have made an arrangement with Abdullah of an informal and temporary character whereby he is to use his whole influence to prevent any disturbances in the French zone arising out of Trans-Jordania. He will promote the organisation of local levies under the command of British officers, and will develop the local administration now existing. I shall not send a British garrison into Trans-Jordania at present, but air forces will be employed in support of the local levies.Undoubtedly the Emir Abdullah in the existing situation has power to create considerable disturbances. It remains to be seen whether he will have equal power to prevent them. It is by his success or failure in this respect that he must be judged. I hope you will do what you can to assist me in this respect. His principal difficulty will be the Syrian exiles, who are roaming about in Trans-Jordania home-less and angry. I heard with much pleasure from M. de Caix that you were contemplating the possibility of an amnesty at no distant date. Such a course would undoubtedly be a very great help to the pacification of Trans-Jordania and to securing the French zone against annoyance from that quarter. In this connection you may be interested to know that we intend to proclaim a general amnesty, with certain necessary exceptions, in Mesopotamia early in April. If it were possible to synchronise the date of the French and British amnesty it would have the advantage of appearing to be an act taken in common by our two nations and would give the impression to the Arab world that we were working hand in hand. I cannot long delay the amnesty in Mesopotamia; but if there was any chance of its synchronising with similar action upon your Excellency&apos;s part, I would delay it until the eve of Ramadhan. If you think this suggestion helpful, perhaps you will communicate with Sir Herbert Samuel, who will at once inform me.I have arranged with Abdullah that Ali Khoulki, of whom, you spoke to me, shall be removed from his present position and sent to a district remote from the French zone; and I have given the strictest instruction to everyone serving under the Colonial Office to do everything in their power to further and facilitate French interests and the security of French territory. I am sure I can count upon similar aid from you. It is a great advantage that a French soldier, who is so greatly honoured throughout the British service, should at the present juncture be in charge of French interests in the Middle East.With sincere regards,Believe me, &amp;c. (Signed)       WINSTON S. CHURCHILL. His Excellency M. le General Gouraud.Letter from Mr. Churchill to Sir Herbert. Samuel.&apos;My dear Samuel, A t sea, April 2, 1921.I send you in the form of a private letter the procedure which I think we should adopt with regard to Trans-Jordania during the six months from the 1st April. This letter will be officially confirmed from London when I arrive, but meanwhile you should act in accordance with it.
Appendix 20. Palestine Defence Force.EXTRACT FROM MINUTES OF FIRST MEETING OF PALESTINE POLITICAL AND MILITARY COMMITTEE.March 17, 1921.(For remainder of minutes and composition of Committee, see Appendix 17.)Sir Herbert. Samuel mentioned that it was proposed to form a defence force of two battalions during the forthcoming financial year, recruited on the militia basis, under the command of an officer who would be directly responsible to the General Officer Commanding. One battalion would be formed from the Jewish population and one from the Arab.The Chairman observed that the latter battalion, as a factor in the maintenance of public security might in certain circumstances conceivably pass through infinity and change its sign.[6117] RThe Emir Abdullah lias promised to work with us and for us to do his best to restrain the people from anti-French action and to form, with our assistance, a local administration which can later on be handed over to a native Governor of less consequence than himself. His position will be informal, and no question either of governorship or sovereignty is raised. He must be given a very free hand, as he has a most difficult task to perform. Not only has he been checked in mid-career in his campaign against the French, but he has been asked to execute a complete volte-face and to take active steps to nullify the effects of his previous policy. I feel sure that you will realise the extreme delicacy of his position and will make every allowance for it. I have promised him that you will be very chary of believing any complaints against him, whether they come from Trans-Jordania itself or from the French in Syria. The same latitude must be given to him in speeches that he makes as would be given to a Member supporting the Government but with a shaky seat; and I should be glad if you would consult me before remonstrating with him, even if there appears to be some grounds for disappointment.I do not think you can do better than employ Captain Clayton as Abdullah&apos;s adviser. He should be readily available. I must leave you to arrange this yourself with Lord Allenby. I have informed Lord Allenby that you will probably be asking him almost immediately for Clayton&apos;s temporary services. I have also telegraphed to Lord Curzon asking him to help on this point.With regard to finance, I am prepared to regard Trans-Jordania as an Imperial commitment for the present, and will not ask you to contribute towards the deficit in expenditure from Palestine revenues beyond the sum you have already provided on account of the Trans-Jordanian share of Palestinian customs less certain deductions. At the same time, you should exercise as close a control over this expenditure as you can consistently with leaving Abdullah a free hand, and I look forward to the time when the Trans-Jordanian revenues, like those of Palestine, will not only contribute to, but ultimately meet in full, all civil and military charges. The taxes, if any, collected in Trans-Jordania will in the first instance be credited to the Colonial Office. I shall credit you with the necessary funds as soon as the vote is taken in the House of Commons. Meanwhile, I must ask you to advance whatever sums are necessary, pending the final readjustment. In particular I wish you to make an immediate advance on this basis up to 5,000 . to Abdullah for his personal expenses, quite apart from administrative or military expenditure, in Trans-Jordania. This had better be arranged through Lawrence, as he will know better what Abdullah&apos;s needs are and how the payments can most conveniently be made.I enclose you a copy of a letter which I have sent to General Gouraud, and also of a note which I shall circulate to the Cabinet immediately on my return, and, thirdly, a copy of a telegram which I have sent to Sir Percy Cox.Yours, &amp;c.(Signed)       WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.
Sir Herbert Samuel hoped to enlist two battalions of 600 men each in the next few months. They would have six months&apos; training and then serve for six months at their stations: in each of the next three years they would serve for three months and afterwards be called up in case of emergency. These proposals were not yet finally approved. He hoped that it would be possible to maintain 1,000 men under arms who would always be available out of 1,200 serving. 2,400 recruits, if forth-coming, would be enlisted during the years 1921-22. He held the view that if there were a garrison in Trans-Jordania it would be easier, and not more difficult, to reduce the garrison in Palestine, as disturbances were always liable to emanate from across the Jordan. The feeling of the Jews was that it was only equitable for them to defend their own National Home, and he was aware that similar senti-ments could not fail to affect British public opinion, where the argument that it was unjust and unnecessary for British blood to be shed and British money spent in defending the Jews would certainly be advanced in the event of disturbances. He therefore proposed to make an appeal to the patriotism of young Jews, as it was impossible, owing to financial limitations, to maintain an adequate force at a high rate of pay. They would, therefore, only receive 5s. a week, but he was informed that there would be no difficulty in obtaining sufficient recruits from Jewish sources to complete the establishment. In order to prevent a grievance arising among the Arabs, if only a Jewish force were formed, it was proposed to offer the opportunity of recruitment to Arabs at the same rates. He realised that it might prove impossible to complete establishments from Arab sources on these conditions, but at -least there would then be no justification for complaint against the Jewish force. In his opinion Palestine would, for political reasons, require British troops in the country for as long as could be foreseen. He felt confident that the disposable revenue of the country, excluding railway and post office expenditure and debt charges, which now amounted to 1,250,000/., would, in the not far distant future, increase to two million pounds. He thought that in the future it would meet the views of the people of Palestine and of the British Empire if the British troops maintained in Palestine were made a charge upon the Palestine Government when its revenue could bear the cost.SECOND MEETING OE THE PALESTINE MILITARY COMMITTEE.March 18,1921.President:Lieutenant-General Sir W. Congreve.Members:Major-General Sir P. P. de B. Radcliffe. Air-Vice-Marshal Sir G. Salmond. Mr. W. H. Deedes. Colonel-Commandant Newman. Colonel Lawrence.Secretary:Lieutenant-Colonel B. H. Waters Taylor.His Excellency the High Commissioner of Palestine, the Rt. Hon. Sir Herbert Samuel, P.C, G.B.E., was present.The Committee proceeded to discuss the future composition and functions of the Palestine Defence Force.1. The military members of the Committee stated as a principle that local armies should not be created; any forces in addition to those required for maintenance of law and order and internal security should be Imperial troops available in an emergency for service in any part of the world. The views of the military members of the Committee were that the most valuable effort of Palestinian patriotism would be the contribution of an efficient and adequate gendarmerie releasing Imperial forces from the duties of police. The formation of a gendarmerie force would remove the contentious points which would arise from the creation of a Jewish national, army. The latter force could not be employed in Palestine except within restricted Jewish areas; its use in operations outside Palestine was inadvisable on account of the religious feeling which would be
1.17provoked throughout the Arab world. None of these objections held good in the case of gendarmerie, who would be equally efficient in holding the frontier posts.2. The arguments of the High Commissioner in favour of a Palestine defence force were heard. The High Commissioner stated that the question of policy had been referred to the Colonial Office who had consulted the War Office, and had telegraphed that the War Office saw no objection to the proposals he had made. The preliminary arrangements had therefore already been put in hand. A defence force locally raised was advisable, (a) to enable Jews to share in bearing the brunt of defending their National Home; (b) to provide against the possible eventuality that British troops, at some period of difficulty for the Empire, might be wholly, or almost wholly, withdrawn; and (e) to enable Palestine contributions to be made to the cost of defence (the people would prefer their forces to be used, at least partially, for a local force, rather than for the money to be used entirely as a payment for the services of British troops). A gendarmerie would not at all satisfy Jewish sentiment, and men would only enlist in it for full wages, and not on the inexpensive scale proposed for the defence force. Nor would a gendarmerie satisfy the conditions (a) and (b) above. Local forces have been created elsewhere, e.g., the King&apos;s African Rifles. The necessity is the greater in Palestine as it is not a permanent possession, and as it was possible that the mandate might be terminated. The force would contain both Jewish and non-Jewish companies. These could be employed without objection for defence against raids, and could be employed in support of the police for the suppression of internal disturbances, except where political issues were involved. He did not think that it would be safe for all British troops to be withdrawn for many years to come, though he was obliged to contemplate the possibility that orders might be sent from London in certain eventualities to evacuate the country.3. The Committee considered, and the G.O.C.,E.E.F., was imperative on the point, that the uniform of the Palestine local forces should be quite distinct from that of the Imperial forces. The High Commissioner was in agreement as to the necessity of a distinction, but considered that the uniform of the local forces should approximate to that of the Imperial forces.4. Sir Herbert Samuel proposed that with each battalion of his local defence force should be a cavalry detachment of perhaps fifty strong, owning their own horses, if volunteers could be found who were willing to bring horses and to serve as cavalry. The armament and composition of these forces should follow that of the Imperial forces, i.e., machine gun platoons, Vickers guns (and possibly Hotchkiss guns for the cavalry), and in addition first line transport. The general principles to be aimed at in the formation of these local forces was that the Imperial army should assist as far as was within their power with instructors, organisation and administration; the local forces paying any actual expenses to wnich the Imperial forces might be put on this account, but desiring to be treated as an adjunct of the Imperial forces.5. The subject of air force action in Trans-Jordania was then discussed. The High Commissioners point of view was that the air force operating in Trans-Jordania should be considered as much an integral portion of the Imperial forces in that district as the air forces operating in Palestine are considered an integral portion of the Palestine garrison. He further considered that the formation of an air station at Amman should be almost entirely a charge against the Desert Air Route. The military members of the Committee were of opinion that it would be necessary to commence forthwith the construction of aerodromes and their necessary dumps at Irbid, Kerak and Amman. The ground for the aerodromes and labour involved in their construction appeared, as regards the first two, to be a charge against the Trans-Jordan Government As regards Amman the allocation of the amounts due from the Government or the air route should be a matter of settlement between the Departments concerned. The guards for aerodromes and dumps to be undertaken by the local gendarmerie.   The High Commissioner concurred.i6117lR 2
EXTRACT FROM MINUTES OF SIXTH MEETING OF COMBINED POLITICAL AND MILITARY COMMITTEE.March 19, 1921.(For remainder of minutes and composition of Committee see Appendix 18.)The Chairman read the report of General Congreve&apos;s Committee of the 18th March on the Palestine Defence Force. He realised&apos;that General Congreve was in favour of a gendarmerie, but he thought that, bearing in mind the world-wide character of the&quot; Zionist movement, and the desire expressed by the Jews to help in their own defence, it would be better to decide upon troops.General Congreve emphasised that an entirely distinctive uniform should be worn by the, Defence Force. In the disturbances in Jerusalem a year ago members of the Jewish battalion had been taken for British soldiers because both forces^ wore the same khaki. In view of the racial feeling in the country at the present time there was no doubt that a very clear distinction should be made.Sir Herbert Samuel observed that he was anxious that in order to increase its prestige among the local population the general impression should be given that the Defence Force was attached to the British army. He agreed that some distinction should be made, but he thought that the provision of an Australian hat and a different badge for the Jewish battalion would perhaps be sufficient. No definite decision had yet been arrived at as to the Arab battalion. He pointed out that the Sherifian army had been allowed to wear khaki.General Congreve observed that the only reason for this was that no other material was available during the war, and he must insist that the two uniforms should be unmistakably distinct.The Chairman agreed with General Congreve, and he suggested that Sir Herbert Samuel should appoint two members of his staff to submit suggestions for discussion.General Congreve stated that if he were unable to be present himself, Colonel Waters-Taylor would represent him.Sir Herbert Samuel requested Mr. Deedes a*nd Captain Peake to take the matter up, and to get patterns of the uniform approved by him made as soon as possible for the Secretary of State to see before his departure. He hoped that the army would assist in training the Defence Force, and would agree that officers and N.C.Os. might attend courses given at tArmy Schools of Instruction, at the expense of the Palestine Government.General Congreve agreed to assist. Sir Herbert Samuel asked from what source officers of the Defence Force should receive their commissions.Major Young pointed out that if they were to receive them from the King, the Defence Force would at once become part of the Imperial army. In Egypt and West Africa officers were seconded for duty wiffi the local forces.Sir Herbert Samuel pointed out that this would necessitate all the officers holding British regular commissions.Mr. Deedes suggested that as the troops belonged to the mandatory, the commissions might be given by the King until such time as the mandate ceased, when power to grant them would be vested in the local Government.Colvnel Waters-Taylor stated that in West Africa the High Commissioner issued a warrant to officers, granting them special local powers:Major Young stated that it had been definitely ruled by the Law Officers of the Crown that Palestine could not be regarded as a part of the British Empire, when the point was raised in connection with the extension to Palestine of Imperial preference. Indian officers of the Indian army received their commission from the Viceroy.The Chairman agreed that this was the precedent to be followed, and that commissions to local officers of the Defence Force should be issued by the High Commissioner. A form of warrant or commission would be drawn up by the Middle East Department in London.

Politically, the reason why I have favoured the militia system or service and the large reserve is that one had to contemplate the possibility that Imperial reasons or political reasons might demand the withdrawal of the army, and that we should be thrown on our own resources.Appendix B.Summary of Comparative Nelt Rates of Pay in  .
If we have, say, 1,000 or 1,500 men trained to arms, the situation might be an exceedingly difficult one. If, on the other hand, we had several thousands in reserve we could face that situation. This is an aspect of the matter that is purely political and not military at all, which point of view would have to be taken into account.I have to consider that we may be thrown on our own resources and make provision for that situation.The second consideration is financial. I was asked by the Cabinet in a very urgent telegram to make a. contribution to the finances of the country.Now, the great advantage of the militia system is its cheapness, as the men are not paid but only receive a small allowance. After their term of short service they go back to their farms or employment. The allowance to be 1/. per month. As between militia and gendarmerie there would be a saving of many thousands of pounds.From the point of view of efficiency the men with a six months&apos; training could not be so good as those with twelve months&apos; training. Six months&apos; training would, however, probably be sufficient for the purpose in view.The other consideration which is of great importance is the Jew and Arab problem. The Jews would come forward in large numbers, which cannot be said of the Arabs. The Arabs obviously will not pay for a Jewish force, and I am not sure but that we will have to have a dual system. This is a possible contingency which, I think, must be considered, and which I have thought about very deeply.There is no question, of course, that the numbers would be far greater under the militia system than under the long service.As far as the Arab is concerned, he is of more value for long service. In all our experience the militiaman is not so good, but there is good material here. A great number of the population have already had training. Many Jews have served in the Judean battalion, and others have served with the Russian army.General Costello agreed, and considered they were quite up to the level of the Indian army. He emphasised the fact that militia service was not suitable to men of the Arab type, as shown by experience on the Indian frontier.Colonel Smith said that with regard to short service for Arabs he was against it. When dealing with Arabs as soldiers the discipline must be continuous if you are to use them as a fighting force.Colonel Bramley, when asked for his views, remarked that he was mainly concerned as to how far this force would be of assistance to him from the point of view of public security, and therefore its efficiency was very important.General Palin said that, talking as a general commanding the troops in Palestine, he thought that any force that is raised in Palestine which will come under that general should be a regular force with long service. With regular troops the discipline and training is better.If you had a training depot at Ludd with a staff to begin with of British instructors, which I think the War Office would supply, and if the pay was good (with a contract for one or two years and local rank), I think you would get a very good staff of instructors. The recruits (long service) would go there for instruction and be drafted out to the areas or battalions or companies in Northern or Southern Palestine as required.The whole of the force would be trained under the one system, under the officer commanding the Defence Force.The Secretary of State remarked that, looking at the question from a political point of view, he did not think that it need be contemplated that England would suddenly say that she would recall all the troops, leaving the population of Palestine without any means of defence. If matters came to that pass in England we would be in a very bad way, and the country would be in a state of revolution.I want you to have a Jewish battalion which will be a credit to the Jews and to the British, and discipline is a thing which comes only after considerable training. Our experience of the British army has shown the value of discipline in regiments where you have long service, N.C.Os. and men imbued with esprit de corps and a soldierly spirit.His Excellency: If we put the Defence Force on a militia basis the Jews will enlist and the Arabs won&apos;t. On the other hand, if you put it on long-service basis  say three years the Arabs will enlist and the Jews won&apos;t.   The Jews don&apos;t want
to be soldiers, they want to cultivate the land. They do not come here with the idea of spending three years in the army.The Secretary of State said he quite appreciated this point, and asked the High Commissioner to sound opinion on both sides. He thought it would be a very good thing if many of the Jews on first arriving in the country did a certain, amount of service.The question of pay was discussed. If men serving in the Defence Force are paid at the same rate as the men in the gendarmerie it would mean an increase of 36,000/. annually above the present estimate.The Secretary of State brought up the question of making a grant of land to the soldier at the end of his service.The Secretary of State said that he could certainly promise to make a contribu-tion to the upkeep from Colonial Office funds.His Excellency the High Commissioner said that when he received the telegram from the Foreign Office he looked about to see how much he could afford from the revenues of Palestine. The present revenue of Palestine only just covers expenditure, the expenditure having been unduly cut down; very little is given to various services which ought to have much more.The Ottoman Public Debt now brings in 300,000/. a year. The Turkish Financial Commission has to be paid an annuity for the year which is past. It has been ascertained from Constantinople that the figure may not be more than 200,000/., leaving 100,000/. which is going to the Defence Force. It,may be even less, in which case there may be 150,000/. in hand.In addition, during the last two years, since the occupation, the revenues have not been handed over but have been put to a Suspense Account, so there is an accumulation of nearly half a million, which is being used temporarily for certain capital expenditure until a loan is arranged. The whole of that sum is to be allocated to the Defence Force.This will be discussed later.On the militia basis the charge would be very much heavier the first year than for later years, also the force would cause considerably over 100,000/. deficit for several years to come, which would be paid for when the revenues expanded sufficiently to enable us to pay. If the contribution was so much per cent, of the revenue, that would be quite sufficient from the Treasury point of view. I am anxious to relieve the Treasury of the cost of Palestine. I want to be in a position to say after a few years (I cannot say it now), that Palestine will pay for her own defence by employing her own troops, but I think it will always be necessary to have a British garrison here.Secretary of State: You can pay the Colonial Office and I will pay the War Office.It is not indispensable that the same conditions should operate with regard to the Arabs and the Jews. It would be much better if they could, but do what is necessary to meet the needs of both within the limits of military efficiency.The longer the service the better. Try and see what inducements you can make to get the Jews to come forward on the basis of three years&apos; service, or if that is impossible then two.As for the Arabs they might do two years.His Excellency said that he would ascertain the views of the various representatives.The Secretary of State remarked that if the Jews came forward on the three or four years basis and the Arabs on two years it would add to the complexity of the work.It was pointed out that there were various forms of enlistment in England, and it was hoped that the men would come forward voluntarily.His Excellency: What is a substitute or alternative for the militia system ?General Costello suggested two years for a Jew and Arab alike, with the option of extending their service on completion to say six or eight years.Colonel Bromley said that the same method of enlistment was in force in the police.General Costello thought it was necessary to compare the two services. In the militia a man did one year to start with and three months during each consecutive year
[6117]for four years. In the suggested short-service system a man put in two years to start with and would only come up for training again for periods of two months in every second year.The High Commissioner emphasised the fact that he had been asked by the Foreign Office to do all he could in the way of defence with the money at his disposal.The Secretary of State: The Cabinet is very averse to the idea of spending seven million on the defence of Palestine, and if the number of regular troops could be reduced the saving on the military would be available for public works. There should be no great difficulty about this.The High Commissioner: Suppose I find when I go into the estimates that the force of 1,200 men will cost more than we have money for, would you rather that I should ask you to make up the amount or have fewer men ?The Secretary of State: Put up this case. The point is whether I can get the General Staff to agree that the formation of a new unit justified the withdrawal of British or Indian units and will show a saving on the unit.The High Commissioner: I have this half million to draw on and I am quite prepared to use this up for the sake of defence.The Secretary of State: Things have changed since last year. I am looking at it from a different point of view from the point of view of the British army. Last year we could not discharge all our duties as we were very short of troops, now things are settling down.There is of course the Egyptian situation which is a serious one and I am pretty certain that the General Staff will&apos;endeavour to keep a considerable number of British units in Egypt. Instead of dispensing with British units they will dispense with the Indian units and place a special reserve in Egypt.Obviously the forces in Egypt and in Palestine must be considered as available to support each other in the event of emergency. A number of British units will always hold the Canal.The High Commissioner: I am afraid of being reproached in the future when there is a sudden change of Government in England which will take all the troops away of having nothing in the way of a Defence Force.The Secretary of State: If they say we are going to clear out of Palestine, which appears perfectly safe, and where they have such and such a number of Jews in training, it might be very dangerous. It would be a very difficult thing to hold the population down by a minority.General Costello asked whether the expense of the force was fully realised. He had general headquarter figures, and they were very large figures 280,000/. for the original force of 2,400 militia.The High Commissioner: When I was talking about the financial position I did not mention that when we get this force in being we can make a great reduction ir. the police.On the other hand, there is Trans-Jordania, and if we are considering the cost of a Defence Force there I have not got any money to pay for it.The Secretary of State:  I am rather hoping that we may avoid the need of . putting British units in Trans-Jordania, in which case I should certainly say that with half a million in hand that a portion could be used to raise a local Defence Force. It might be possible to raise high-class native units there with a higli percent-age of British officers.The High Commissioner: We did contemplate that we need not have British troops permanently in Trans-Jordania, Our Defence Force should be the garrison of Trans-Jordania.Colonel Bramley referred to the question of cutting down the Police Force, and ventured to point out that the police could not safely be cut down before the Defence Force was a really efficient unit contributing to the public security of this country.The Secretary of State suggested that the details should be discussed later and the conference ended.
Minutes of a Meeting held at Government House, Wednesday, March 30,1921.Present:Civil Secretary. Financial Secretary. General Costello. Major Young. Sir George Barstow. Mr. C. D. Harvey..... when Palestine is prepared they can take over Defence Force and say this is our force.Sir George Barstow: It would be easier for us to say that from the 1st April Palestine is contributing to the Defence Force until she is in a position to bear the entire cost, when it could be split off from the Imperial Forces.The question was asked whether politically this was as valuable as being able to say that the force was paid for out of Palestine revenues.Sir George Barstow replied that politically there was nothing in it.Mr. Deedes pointed out that the High Commissioner was very anxious that, as soon as possible, Palestine should bear the whole cost of the Defence Force and that he would be in a position to say that it cost the British tax-payer nothing.The Colonial Office vote to be divided into three parts, purely military expendi-ture through the War Office, any civil grant-in-aid which may be necessary for capital expenditure, and the Local Force, quite a separate thing under the Colonial Office.For purely military purposes it would be under the respective general officers commanding.In Mesopotamia a note had been written by Mr. Crosland copy attached  explaining what the exact procedure would be. They would not be under the Army Act.English officers would be seconded from the army to this force.General Costello would be responsible to the High Commissioner from a purely administrative standpoint, enlistment, recruiting, &amp;c. For the military employment of them he would be responsible to the general officer commanding.Enlistment should be for short service with option of renewal for long service; the same for every class of men.British officers in the senior ranks would gradually be replaced by Palestinian officers when they were ready to take their place.What was likely to be the ultimate cost if Palestine took over the cost of upkeep ? Very much less than the contribution they would have to make to the Imperial Force.Of course there would always be a certain number of English troops kept in Palestine to form the nucleus of an army in case of need to defend it from its non-Arabian (?) neighbours.In Mesopotamia it was proposed to reduce the garrison to four battalions; now it was two divisions.During the interim period, while the change is being effected, the pay of the units officered by British officers to be met, as far as possible, out of local revenue.The Colonial Office will pay for the whole cost of upkeep and we pay them our contribution.Will this be assessed on the basis of a percentage of revenue ? Yes, in Mesopotamia.Taking a percentage of revenue is rather difficult. Different countries have different ideas as to what constitutes public revenue. Trans-Jordania cannot be counted on to provide any revenue.With regard to Trans-Jordania, the proposal now is that the force that is going to be raised there immediately-on the same lines as the Palestine Defence Force will entirely obviate the necessity of sending troops there.With regard to the administration of funds, where will they be administered from?Is the Defence Force which is to take the place of the proposed Defence Force going to be under G.H.Q. as at present constituted?
On the lines that it has been discussed it should be considered as a unit just as the other regiments.The grant which we are to receive from the Colonial Office to maintain this force here in Palestine as part of the garrison will be paid to the War Office.Sir George Barstow: I dont think there can be direct dealing between the Colonial Office and G.H.Q. here.How is G.H.Q., the Colonial Office and the War Office going to settle matters?Major Young said the Colonial Office was going to have its own Finance Depart-ment and its own Military Department. The War Office have the entire spending of the money, but the proposal is that the finance officers in Mesopotamia and Pales-tine should advise not only on civil, but also on military expenditure.Mr. Churchill says he cannot be responsible for sums spent in the East.Parliament votes monev to the Colonial Office, one of the items is Palestine Defence Force so much. The War Office will have nothing whatever to do with the matter.A long discussion ensued as to the best method of dealing with the accounts of the Defence Force.It was thought it would be possible to run&apos;the Defence Force in the same way as any other Government Department.The question arose of the employment of existing army services, as it would be absurd to start separate machinery.This point to be taken up with Mr. Crosland.Everything in the country that has been paid for either by the British taxpayer or by (?) should be regarded as an Imperial matter, and anything that actually exists now should be regarded as our own.What about roads and public works done by the army when they were in occupation? We have been told that they will ultimately have to be paid for. Interest paid on the actual expenditure. This arrangement stands for Mesopotamia. Value assessed and regarded as paid.   Not necessary that they pay interest at once.The question was raised as to whether General Costello would be put in funds by the Colonial Office. It was presumed that the Palestine military contribution of approximately 91,000/. would be placed to the credit of the G.O.C. here, and in point of fact only the balance of the sum required be sent out from the Colonial Office.There will be a separate budget for Colonial Office money, which will show a contribution in aid from the Palestine budget. The Palestine budget will only show so much from the revenue.Sir George Barstow said that Mr. Bonar Law did not want any civil charge for Palestine to appear in the votes. Now that we have a vote for the whole area there ought to be no difficulty in coming to an arrangement here as with the Mesopotamia people as to what is a Palestinian expense and what is an Imperial one.In Mesopotamia half of the expense of the High Commissioner and (? the full expense) of that part of his staff which could be regarded as filling purely Imperial functions would come out of the Colonial Office vote.It ought to be as easy to arrange here as in Mesopotamia.The work of dealing with the accounts in connection with the Defence Force to be dealt with by a defence Force Department; this will require a financial staff for the purpose of dealing with the Imperial budget. There should be military finance officials who would run all the administration of the finance of the Defence Force. This staff would be paid for out of the Colonial Office vote. But the other half of the staff which dealt with purely local affairs would appear on the Palestine budget. There is a certain obligation here which is an Imperial one and another which is purely local.   The Imperial one will gradually disappear.In Trans-Jordania there are a certain number of officers who are demobilised as from the 1st April. These political officers have been paid for up to date by the army, who is now to be responsible for their pay ?From the 1st April three accounts must be kept, a Colonial Office account, a Palestine account and a Trans-Jordania account. Colonial Office account can be divided in half, i.e., assistance given to Palestine, namely, Defence Force, from which you get a certain amount back, the other (Trans-Jordania), from which you get nothing back.It was pointed out that in the case of Mesopotamia and Kurdistan the same thing applies.All administrative expenditure, the above-mentioned officers, &amp;c, comes out of the Colonial Office vote (Trans-Jordania account).[6117] S 2
mIt must be clearly understood that the Trans-Jordania account is subject to revision.What has been advanced up to date to Trans-Jordania should be regarded as an Imperial loan, not as a Palestinian loan.Mr. Smallwood pointed out that our cash balance was low and our commitments large, and asked whether the Colonial Office was going to put us in funds.Major Young; There is a large sum voted on army votes and the only authority at the moment for making payments is from army votes, but when Mr. Churchill goes back it is proposed that he will lay before Parliament the Middle East vote. He will also have to provide for the special requirements which don&apos;t pass through the army capital for railways, &amp;c, and the army figures will then be revised.Apart from the expense of our Political Officers on the other side&apos; it costs 9,000/. to run Trans-Jordania, which is considered essential expenditure from the point of view of public security. Is it understood that the Colonial Office will be responsible for this?Major Young: The whole of the expenses in Trans-Jordania will be paid for by the Colonial Office.When we get back to London our finance officer who ought to have come out with us will have to go into the whole qusetion, and will write a despatch or tele-gram laying down exactly what is wanted.It was decided that from the 1st April to keep a separate account for Trans-Jordania, close the other account, and carry forward the debt up to date.The pay of the Political Officers and: any advance we may consider proper to make will be got back from the Colonial Office.Meeting held at Government House, Thursday, March 31, 1921.Present:His Excellency the High Commissioner.The Civil Secretary.Sir George Barstow.The Financial Secretary.General Costello.Mr. Richmond.Major the Hon. F. R. Somerset. Captain Peake. Captain Kirkbride. Captain A. F. Kirkbride. Captain Monckton.His Excellency: As you know, negotiations have been proceeding with the Emir Abdullah with a view to making arrangements in conformity both with British interests and those of the Sherifian family.Trans-Jordania plays, of course, an important part in those arrangements, but the position in Trans-Jordania cannot be finally settled until the position in other Arab countries is determined. Meanwhile, it is obviously necessary to make a temporary working arrangement for Trans-Jordania, and it has been decided that the temporary arrangements agreed upon shall be given a trial for six months.The arrangement is as follows: The Emir Abdullah will not receive any formal appointment, but he will be requested by the British. Government to carry on the Government of Trans-Jordania under British superintendence and control. The ultimate arrangement which is contemplated in respect of Trans-Jordania is this, that the territory should be regarded as an Arab province of Palestine part of the area under the British mandate for Palestine and under the general control of the High Commissioner for Palestine, but not administered by the same methods as has been the case during the last six or eight months.Abdullah himself does not express any desire to remain in Trans-Jordania permanently, but it is agreed that he will remain there or thereabout during the next six months. After he leaves there will be appointed an Arab Governor for the whole of the district with subordinate Governors for the three sub-districts. This Governor would be appointed by myself, but his name would be previously agreed
upon by myself and the Emir Abdullah-it would be a joint control. There would be a British representative with Abdullah now and with his successor later, and there will be about the same number of British officers as now in various parts of the district.With respect to troops: At first it was decided that there should be British troops sent over to Amman now, which was the view entertained by the Conference at Cairo, subsequently it has been decided to hold that in abeyance for two reasons, one that the military authorities are still uneasy as to the line of communication between here and Amman, and don&apos;t like placing a detached body of troops at the otHer side of the Jordan with such difficult lines of communication between them and their base supposing the line were cut. Abdullah also was not very keen about having British troops there just now.We shall, however, garrison the country, as soon as they are ready, by a portion of the Palestine Defence Force. The military force in Trans-Jordania will be under the command of General Costello. Recruits will be raised from among such elements of the population as may be found most convenient from Palestine or Trans-Jordania.It may still be that British troops will go over and be stationed at Amman, but no decision to that effect has been reached at present.There will also be a close touch kept with Trans-Jordania by the Air Force. Aerodromes are to be erected at once at Amman, Kerak and Irbid, and steps are going to be taken within the next few days for providing these air stations.An air route is also to be surveyed from Amman across to Mesopotamia and stations are to be arranged where possible in between.It is also arranged that there shall be a flight of aeroplanes over Trans-Jordania about once a fortnight regularly, and afterwards as may be required. This is to start right away.Until the Defence Force can be provided we must continue with the existing Trans-Jordanian Reserve Force, but the Trans-Jordania Force is to be placed under the command of British officers and not merely under the inspection of British officers, and means will be found to finance it and provide such sums as are necessary for Trans-Jordania during the provisional period of six months. This money will be provided by the British Government and not from Palestine revenues, but disbursed by the High Commissioner either through Abdullah or through the officers commanding the Reserve Force, whichever is found most convenient. It is hoped that the revenues of the country, under a more stable state of affairs, will expand, but whatever money is needed will have to be supplied until the country is able to bring in taxes. Abdullah will do everything he can to maintain order and security. He has been given very definitely to understand that there must be no attacks on the French, and the whole arrangement is made on condition of this being observed; this he quite clearly understands, and if, attacks on the French continue then the whole situation must be reconsidered and all subsidies&apos;would cease.It is proposed that I should go over to visit Abdullah on the 12th April at Amman with a party of people and an escort of troops, that would come back after-wards and not remain there, when a statement would be made to the population as to the new situation.Mr. Deedes: I understand that administratively the area will be run as one district either directly by Abdullah or, with some assistance, perhaps, through Mazhar Bey.   It will be divided into three Kazas Irbid, the Belka and Kerak.The Colonial Office vote for Trans-Jordania should, it would appear, be divided into two parts: (1) (a) Civil in respect of the British representatives and their clerical staff, &amp;c; (b) in respect of any deficit in local revenue budget; and (2) in respect of the Defence Force under General Costello.Abdullah should be told, however, that as far as possible local revenues should normally cover all expenses other than under (1) (a) and (2).I think-that they should maintain their own gendarmerie (as distinct from the Reserve Force).Major Somerset said he did not place any faith in Abdullah, and that from conversations which he had had with Abdullah&apos;s leading followers (Achmed Mureiwid, Ali Khulki, Raschid Teleima) he understood that Abdullah was playing his own game and that his intention was to aim at the French at Damascus. These people left here with the idea of stirring up trouble at Amman against the French.Major Camp said he had been given to understand the same thing. Abdullah&apos;s chief friends were prominent adherents of the Syrian Nationalist Party and they
had said they would never rest content so long as any French influence remained in Damascus.Captain Peake asked why Abdullah was so averse to having British troops in Trans-Jordania. All his followers who had come over with him were aware of the conversations between himself and the Secretary of State, but did not think that they would influence the actions of the Emir.His Excellency pointed out that the Emir Abdullah had been given clearly to understand that if there were attacks on the French from our zone, then all our arrangements for Sherifian subsidies and other matters in other parts of the world would all fall to the ground.Major Somerset felt very strongly that British troops ought to be sent to Trans-Jordania.His Excellency pointed out that the military authorities are still very unwilling to send troops, and as the present arrangements had been agreed upon by the Secretary of State and Abdullah, it was necessary to give them a trial and see how they worked.Captain Peake asked whether the Reserve Force for Trans-Jordania was to be raised in that country or in Palestine.His Excellency replied that the Reserve Force in Trans-Jordania would be a branch of General Costello&apos;s force; they will be trained as soldiers and properly disciplined, and perhaps be ready after six months. Whether they will be recruited here or there is not yet determined. Possibly the companies will be mixed  Palestinians and Trans-Jordanians but they &quot;will be trained at Ludd.General Costello was of opinion that it would be simplest to mix them.His Excellency: It is not contemplated at present or in the near future to put any Jewish company over there. During the interim period they must carry on with the troops they have over there. The present Defence Force can be put into better order and paid more regularly. The question whether it was sufficiently large at present or should be increased could be settled during his visit to Amman.Captain Peake asked whether officers who are now wanting jobs would be allowed to join the new Defence Force.General Costello replied that he did not know what the permanent policy was going to be, but that if it is a part of Palestine they would be on the same footing as other Palestinian officers; if it is going to remain an outlying district, then those officers could come in on a temporary basis a militia basis.This will have to be considered in closer detail later on whether Trans-Jordanian officers are to taken into the Palestinian force, and if so, on what terms.Abdullah does not want to remain permanently in Trans-Jordania, but in the meantime, should there be anarchy in Trans-Jordania, he will be held responsible by the British Government.Captain Kirkbride asked what the powers of the British officers in Trans-Jordania would be during the next six months and after.*His Excellency replied that it could not be foreseen, it depended on the regime established there; in the meantime, they will be advisers, with perhaps more authority. 1Major Somerset pointed out that the Arab Government in Damascus had had excellent British advisers, but never in one single instance had the advice of the British representatives been taken.His Excellency: We are responsible for Trans-Jordania as mandatories, and the Government is to be appointed by the authorities here on Abdullah&apos;s recommendation.The influence of the Air Force, while not a substitute for troops, will be con-siderable; they would not, however, take action except in serious necessity, and would not be used to assist in the collection of taxes.Mr. Smallwood was not quite clear as to the money that will be needed for the Political Officers. In Jerash the gendarmerie had not been paid for months, and it was necessary they should get some money. Tafile was eight months in arrear, and in Kerak it was impossible to collect any further taxes. Abdullah had assured us that he would collect taxes. The question was, what sums are immediatelv needed and where should they be spent.
Before coming to a decision His Excellency felt inclined to wait until he went to Amman in twelve days&apos; time, and would discuss the matter with Abdullah.He was very much averse to the principle of aiding those places where they would not pay taxes, for the people who did pay their taxes would argue what was the good of doing so, for if they did&apos;nt they would receive what was necessary for the upkeep of the various services from the Government.Mr. Richmond thought it would be as well to let Abdullah know what the position was in regard to tax collection in order that he might have some plan to talk to his Excellency on his arrival.His Excellency thought the British representatives should go back and tell the people generally what the arrangement is, that we are working with Abdullah, and that they must pay their taxes and put the country on a better footing, and raise a force of trained men.Major Somerset thought that the Trans-Jordanians would not care to go bo far from home for training as Ludd.General Costello said he had asked Colonel Lawrence where would be the best place for training them, and he had thought the men would like to go to Ludd for the change. In the first instance, there is no question but that Ludd is the best place for training.His Excellency: I think that probably the best course would be for Captain Peake to go back and look after his force and get it up to strength and take some money with him, and for this force to go, if Abdullah agrees, to Jerash and Ajlun and collect arrears of taxes, which would then go to pay the officials and Gendarmerie.Major Camp said that the local Defence Force was being used in the meantime in the Belka to collect taxes.Captain Peake thought we needed a much stronger force with machine guns to enforce our authority.Mr. Deedes: We don&apos;t know that Abdullah won&apos;t get in the taxes.His Excellency said that we will give him such financial assistance as he needs to keep the Reserve Force together or to increase it if it is thought to be necessary. He might bring up some of his men from&quot;Ma&apos;an and enlist them in the Reserve Force. He clearly understood that the Reserve Force was to be under British officers. You can take back a letter from here to get the force started on a practical footing with the assurance that additional funds will be forthcoming if necessary, that the subsidy will not be kept down to the same low level as before.The question was raised as to who should pay the Reserve Force, to which his Excellency replied that the Reserve Force would be paid from here and the Gendarmerie and Government employees to be paid by the Local Government. In effect, Captain Peake pointed out, the Gendarmerie had been paid about five times as much by us as by the Local Government.His Excellency was of the opinion that we had better let Abdullah try, through his influence and the influence of the Reserve Force already existing at Amman, to collect the taxes. Perhaps when it is known over there that Abdullah and the British are working together it may perhaps make a difference in the collection of taxes, at any rate we had better try and reserve our subventions to the Reserve Force.Major Camp pointed out that improved communication between Salt and Amman was very necessary and a car was much needed, also for the postal service, which was at present held up for want of a car.Air Vice-Marshal Salmond wants the Salt-Amman road to go forward at once. Money for this can come out of the Colonial Office vote at once.Arrangements are being made with Wasboun to establish a regular mail service with Kerak.   A motor-boat is to run regularly and carry mails and officers. &apos; Further details to be discussed with Mr. Deedes.
Meeting held at Government House, Friday, April 1, 1921.Present:His Excellency the High Commissioner.The Civil Secretary.Sir George Barstow.General Costello.The Financial Secretary.His Excellency: We understand now that if the Defence Force costs about 200,000/. towards this we get a Colonial Office vote of 200,000/., and that Palestine pays a grant-in-aid of, say, 100,000/. towards it.What we don&apos;t understand is the manner in which this 200,000/. would be disbursed.For examine. General Costello to run his force, pay and general expenditure, needs money. Will the 200,000/. be given to this Government and we to treat General Costello as a Department of this Government, or will the 200,000/. be given to the War Office ? or will it be given to G.H.Q. ? We don&apos;t see how this money is going to be touched.Sir George Barstow: What we don&apos;t know is whether you have the organisation here to run a Defence Force, or whether it would not be better to use G.H.Q. as far as possible for staff, &amp;c, and pay them for services here.It was pointed out that we got as much help as possible from G.H.Q. with regard to existing services, and they had promised to help us all they could.Sir George Barstow: Mr. Churchill is very anxious to get rid of what he calls a top-heavy military organisation, and wants the force to be run as economically, and with as little machinery in the way of red tabs as possible; in fact to run the Defence Force more or less on the cheap.The fact must not be lost sight of, however, that the day must come when the Defence Force, as it grows, will require to be self-sufficient.His Excellency thought it might be as well to use the existing machinery and pay 20 per cent, overhead charges for everything that is consumed.There had been a recent letter from Colonel Newman about this. He wanted a Conference with G.H.Q. to determine about purchases; whether there should be a Departmental charge right through.The case was rather different when discussed in Cairo, as then it was expected that Palestine would have to raise the whole of the money.Sir George Barstow: The Colonial Office is prepared to place General Costello in funds for the Defence Force. General Costello to be treated as a Department for dealing with  the War Office, and it would be possible to make arrangements whereby Palestine provides the machinery.General Costello: There would need to be some arrangement with the War Office by which they would provide hospital use, &amp;c.Sir George Barstow: I think that would have to be on repayment. The War Office would have to be paid for services rendered.General Costello was asked how much staff he would require.He pointed out that a D.A.Q.M.G. would be necessary. There would be a good deal of A work hospitals, messes, amusements for the men, moral, &amp;c. A Finance Officer and possibly an Ordnance Officer, and if he had Trans-Jordania as well he would probably need an Intelligence Officer.Sir George Barstow: How much could you drop if you used the War Office organisation ?General Costello: I could drop the Ordnance officer and only have a share of the Finance officer.He pointed out that a senior medical man on his staff would be necessary. In fact, very much the same organisation was required for a small force as would be for an army.Sir George Barstow concurred in the last remark and said the only other alterna-. tive was to simply increase the garrison here by two battalions one Jewish and one Palestinian. The original proposal had been that this Defence Force should be part of the garrison.   The question as to whether it should be, from the present point of view, has not been settled.
A discussion ensued as to means of supply.General Costello was advisee! to keep in touch with Colonel Solomon and see how he ran things, and if necessary all contracting could be done through him.If there were two battalions here forming part of the garrison they could run their buying and feeding on the same lines as in India.There was no need for a cumbersome staff and it was necessary to keep the headquarters staff to as low a figure as possible. For the first year at any rate it might be simpler to run the Defence Force as a department of this Government, and have whatever extra staff is necessary fro tern.Mr. Small wood remarked that he did not think such a, scheme would be workable from General Costello&apos;s point of view.His Excellency said he was rather horrified to learn the number of staff officers that would be required for&apos; such a small force, and asked General Costello to draw up a scheme of organisation with the minimum number of officers necessary.It will be impossible to tell how much the force is going to cost until we know what scheme is favoured by the people Long Service or Short Service.For the first six months we will ask the Colonial Office to pay in at least 50,000/., for that amount will certainly be needed. Directly the Colonial Office vote has been passed the Treasury will not make any objection to making the advance.Sir George Barstow said that a formal despatch should be written about Local Defence Force proposals and sent home for approval.Rates of Pay: There will be the same rate of pay for everyone. No colour distinction. General Costello said he had worked out a.:statement giving the rates in the British Army without income tax being deducted.Sir George Barstow remarked that this would have to go home to the Colonial Office. Officers from the British army or Indian army would be seconded. The same thing applies in the Egyptian Army. They come in for two years which can be increased to 4, 7 and 10 years, and the agreement can be terminated by either side by three months notice. The only criticism is that it is too long. People ought to be sent back to their regiment every five years. Major Young talked of a five years contract here. .His Excellency pointed out that in creating a new force instead of working out all details it would be better to take the Egyptian army as a working plan, and if there is no reason to the contrary adopt their methods. It would be much simpler to use an existing model except when there is reason for differing from it.Mr. Bcedes thought that instead of taking the Egyptian Army as a model it would be better to take the King&apos;s African Rifles which is a force of four battalions. They were in the ordinary grades of the Civil Administration and were subject to all the Civil Administration rules and regulations, and there was no trouble at all about British army rates of pay.Trans-J ordania.His Excellency: 1,400/. have been given to Captain Peake this morning and he proposed that this should be shown as Colonial Office vote Trans-Jordania  (Military). It was not quite clear whether the ultimate intention was that the salaries of British representatives in Trams-Jordan!a should come out of their revenue when they have any, or out of the Colonial Office vote. It is npt known if the Customs will more than cover the O.P.D., but the next charge against it should be for our officers. It was very difficult to get at any accurate figure for Customs Duty, but some figure must be arrived at, accurate or inaccurate, and his Excellency suggested that a Committee should be formed consisting of Mr. Smallwood and Mr. Harari or Mr. Barron, and the matter gone into. Pie would suggest that Mr. Harari be sent to Trans-Jordania for a few days to get some information.Sir George Barstow asked what usually became of Trans-Jordania revenue. It was pointed out that the Treasuries were usually empty, and immediately any money came in it was at once paid out to officials and the gendarmerie, but no one had received any pay for weeks.It was hoped that when order was restored that the revenues might incrase; it is not a poor country, but the inhabitants have a strong dislike to paying taxes.[6117]T
PALESTINE FINANCE.Notes of a Conference held at Government House, Jerusalem, on Thursday,March 31, 1921, at 10-15 a.m.Present:His Excellency the Rt. Lion. Sir Herbert Samuel, GB.E.Sir George Barstow, K.C.B.Mr. H. A. Smallwood.Mr. C. D. Harvey.General Costello.Mr. E. Keith-Roach.Mr. G. Myrddin-Evans.Defence.1. The discussion centred on the policy to be adopted as regards the creation of a defence force, and of Palestine&apos;s financial contribution towards the upkeep of this force. It was stated that what was at present contemplated was the creation of one force for Palestine which would also occupy Trans-Jordania, and could be moved about at will. Reference was also made to the suggestion that the whole of the forces in Egypt, Palestine and Trans-Jordania should be treated as one unit; in that case as the Defence Force in Trans-Jordania became more efficient the British Forces would gradually withdraw. The question of whether recruitment should be for long or short service was still under consideration pending the expression by the Moslem leaders of their views on the Defence Scheme. It was suggested that the Jews and the Arabs might be offered the choice the Jews would probably choose short service, the Arabs long service but that recruitment in Trans-Jordania should be for long service only.As regards finance it was estimated that the cost of the long service scheme for Palestine only, excluding Trans-Jordania, would be 285,000/. for a force of 2,400 men for the first year, and 245,000/. in subsequent years (the short service scheme would cost about 36,000/. less per annum). This estimate was framed on a war basis and on British army rates of pay, but it was felt that the local forces could not reasonably expect to be paid for service locally at the same rates as British soldiers serving so far from home.The High Commissioner expressed concern at the high estimate and stated that either the cost must be considerably reduced or Palestine would not be able to maintain so large a force as had been anticipated. On the other hand he expected that Palestine would be much richer a few year hence than it was at present, and they could in the meantime draw for defence purposes upon the surplus balances accruing from the revenues assigned to the Ottoman Public Debt.Mr. Smallwood referred to a suggestion that had been made by Major Young that the whole,of the cost of Palestine defence should appear on the Colonial Office vote, and the contribution of Palestine to that defence as an appropriation in aid of the vote, and stated that if this was done there would be no need to draw upon the Surplus Balances for defence purposes.Sir George Barstow suggested that as the revenues of Palestine increased the contribution of the country towards defence should increase also, until it covered the whole defence provision with the exception of such portion of the cost of the Defence Force as could fairly be attributed to Trans-Jordania. He emphasised his view of the importance of the principle that defence is one of the primary obliga-tions of Palestine, the whole of whose revenues should be available for meeting defence charges, and that there should be allocated thereto not the surplus of increased revenue over expenditure, but the greater part of the total increase in revenue. Admitting the backwardness of the country and the necessity for the development of social schemes, upon which the High Commissioner had laid stress in his despatch of February, it had to be remembered that the British taxpayer was also feeling the weight of almost unbearable taxation, and had had to accept the postponement of many ameliorative schemes, and was unlikely to view with favour the continued provision of large sums for the defence of Palestine if the latter country devoted its increased revenues to other schemes. He suggested that one-half of any future increase in revenue should be allocated to defence until the Palestine
Budget completely provided for the cost of the Defence Force, except such part of it as should be fairly attributable to Trans-Jordania.The High Commissioner while agreeing generally with Sir George Barstow&apos;s remarks referred to the undesirable effect on the minds of the population of a decision to allocate all increased revenues to defence purposes. Further, once the proposed loan was floated the interest and sinking fund charges thereon would constitute a first charge on Palestine revenues. He was willing, however, to accept Sir George. Barstow&apos;s suggestion, if instead of increased revenue there were substituted the net increase in revenue after provision had been made for loan charges.Sir George Barstow pointed out that even if there were no increase in revenue the loan charges would have to be met in that case by cutting down other services. For political reasons he thought it should appear as soon as possible that Palestine was paying for its own defence. He agreed, however, to draft a formula on the lines he had suggested and submit it to the High Commissioner, taking into account Palestine^ present contribution of 100,000/., and on the general assumption that the Palestine Defence Force as a whole would be borne on the Colonial Office vote and would cost about 250,000/., the proportion of the cost properly attributable to Palestine and Trans-Jordania being determined.Ottoman Public Debt Balances.2. The balance in the hands of the Palestine Administration accruing from the Ottoman Public Debt revenues amounts to about 450,000/., which it is proposed to spend on defence, on capital works. In the meantime, however, pending the raising of a loan, there are certain works of a public character which are urgently needed (vide the High Commissioner^ despatch of the 4th February, paragraph 24), and authority was sought to draw on the Ottoman Public Debt balances to finance these works, making repayment out of the proceeds of the proposed loan.The High Commissioner mentioned that the Secretary of State for the Colonies desired that the scheme for improving agricultural stock should be proceeded with immediately in view of the effect it was likely to have on the minds of the agricultural community.In the course of the discussion it appeared that 302,000/. of the balances had already been drawn in order to finance certain railways and post office works, leaving only about 150,000/. available. The cost of the most urgent of the works with which it was now desired to proceed amounted to about 250,000/., while it was estimated that 137,000/. would probably be spent by October 1921, if the loan were not raised by that time.Sir George Barstow pointed out that the remaining balances would cover only a proportion of the works still regarded as necessary. He agreed, however, to the most urgent of these being proceeded with, at the same time indicating the narrow-ness of the margin available, and emphasising the danger of overspending these balances, a situation which would necessitate borrowing from the bank.Palestine Loan.3. The High Commissioner pointed out that it would not be possible to raise a loan on the market, until the Mandate had been approved by the League of Nations. He stated that he had received an offer from Mr. Rothschild to float the loan without charge. The terms of issue suggested (viz., a 6 per cent, loan issued at 75 and repayable at par by annual drawings), were, he thought, unacceptable, and in his view it should be possible, to obtain the money on much more favourable terms. He disliked also the method of redeeming the Bonds by annual drawings; but he was rather attracted by a provision he had seen in connection with a municipal loan, that should the holder die before the loan was redeemed his estate should have the option of claiming repayment at par.Sir George Barstow suggested that it might be advisable not to go to the market at present. Money was now very tight, but in a few years&apos; time it might be cheaper, and better terms obtained, or it might be more advantageous to float two smaller loans rather than one big loan. If the money were obtained, and it was not possible to proceed at once with the Development Schemes, the Palestine Government would have to find the difference between the interest on the loan and the interest on the money left on deposit.  Further, it was possible to attempt development too quickly,[6117] T2
and if the money were available there was always the temptation to spend it. As regards the question of floating the loan, he suggested that it might be desirable to consult the Crown Agents as to the terms on which they would do this.The High Commissioner said that he had received advice that it would probably bo more successful to float one big loan rather than two smaller ones; by undertaking a publicity campaign and appealing to Jewish sentiment throughout the world, there would probably.be no difficulty in raising the money. There was, he thought, little danger either of the money lying idle when obtained, or of its being spent on works of secondary importance; in the first place, there was an immense amount of labour waiting to come into the country once work was available, and, in the second place, the necessary urgent works of first importance were in themselves more than sufficient to employ the proceeds of the loan. He thought the loan should be issued as soon as possible for political reasons; the development works contemplated would benefit Jew and Arab alike, and would tend to obviate any chance of trouble. He asked that it should be stated in the loan prospectus that it was issued with the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government.Sir George Barstow undertook to consult the authorities at home as to whether there was any objection to this course, and also to enquire if the loan could be made a trustee security.Trans-Jordania Customs Receipts. (4. It was felt that a certain proportion of the Customs receipts would properly belong to Trans-Jordania. Against this would be set the proportion of the Ottoman Public Debt annuity payable by that territory, as well as the cost of the political officers employed there.Palestine Estimates 1921-1922.5. Sir George Barstow said that he had no criticism of a general nature on the estimates for 1921-1922. It was true that there was a deficit but&apos; this was just covered by the surplus of 75,000/. in 1920-1921, and he understood that the Depart-mental Estimates had been reduced by 300,000/. in order to arrive at the estimates which had been submitted. In view of the very narrow margin which the estimates showed he thought it was necessary to be very careful as regards entering into commit-ments which might increase in future years and so prevent the budget from balancing. It was possible, however, that the Ottoman Public Debt annuity would not amount to as much as 200,000/., and they might not have to pay the additional sum to the Tobacco Regie.With regard to particular questions, Sir George stated that it seemed to him that the administrative staff was very large considering the population of the country, and there was a considerable danger of discontent if the country were over-administered. In particular, the medical staff appeared to him large. He referred also to the number of motor-cars in use by officers, which must involve a very considerable charge, and which he would like to see largely reduced.One other point had been raised, viz., whether any part of the salary of the High Commissioner and his staff should fall upon the British exchequer. That, he thought, was a question that could only be settled after consultation with Ministers at home.The High Commissioner agreed that the administrative staff was large, but pointed out that the employment of British officials was necessary owing to the failure to obtain efficient Palestinians. As regards the size of the medical staff, he explained that the country people paid very heavy tithes, and an 11 per cent. ad valorem customs duty, for which they obtained very little tangible benefits, except schools and hospitals. The cost of running motor-cars did constitute a very heavy charge on the revenues, but there was no other means of getting about quickly and conveniently. It should, however, be possible to cut down the number of cars, and he was having that looked into. Of the new Departments that were set up, Land Settlement and the Cadastral Survey should pay for themselves in fees; while the cost of the Department of Antiquities only amounted to from 4,000/. to 5,000/. which he thought was a small sum in view of the international obligations of Palestine to preserve the objects of interest which the country contained. He agreed that the question of the charge for the salary of the High Commissioner and his staff should remain over, leaving the full provision in the Palestine Estimates for the present.
Salaries, Staff, &amp;c.6. A short discussion took place on the question of the salaries and grading of the administrative staff.Two schemes had been put forward, one by the High Commissioner, which contemplated grading the staff in six grades, the other by the Foreign Office, under which the staff would be divided into five grades. The Home authorities had given instructions for the revised gradings, as proposed by the Foreign Office, to come into operation immediately, a suggestion which had given rise to a sense of grievance on the part of the staff. Although there was little money in it, and some members received increases under the scheme, it had the effect in certain cases of placing an, officer on the maximum of his grade without any immediate prospect of an increase or promotion. In addition, under this scheme, the heads of Departments would be receiving the same salaries as their principal assistants, a result which the High Commissioner strongly deprecated.&apos; Sir George Barstow explained that he had agreed to the postponement of the new scheme for three months, during which period the Home Administration would reconsider the matter in the light of the conclusions reached by the Committee which had sat at Cairo to consider the question of the conditions of service of officers employed in countries under the Middle Eastern Department of the Colonial Office. Certain appointments had, he understood, been made on the new scale, i.e., Foreign Office gradings, and in these cases too there should be no change for three months, while he suggested that any new officers employed before the scheme was definitely settled should be employed on monthly salaries only.The High Commissioner pointed out that it was not the intention to employ any more new officers. He wished to place on record his view that the Committee which had sat at Cairo, and of which he had been a member, had never contemplated the application of its recommendations to Palestine officials. The report of the Committee should in fact have expressly excluded Palestine from, the scope of its recommendations. It was clearly understood at Cairo that the Palestine service was to form part of the Colonial Service, but that there should be special recruitment in view of the special qualifications necessary for service in that country. Many of the senior -officials in the Palestine service had received definite promises of permanent employment, and he could not now contemplate offering these officers five-year contracts.Subject to this he agreed with Sir George Barstow&apos;s proposal.Ku?itara-Rafa\ Railway.7. A short discussion took place on this subject.The High Commissioner expressed the view that the line was essential to Palestine from the economic as well as from the military point of view; both on account of the flow of commerce and in view of the possible development of tourist and pilgrim traffic. The line was of interest to Egypt too, as with proper travelling facilities the two countries together would constitute one of the greatest attractions to travellers from America and Europe. The Egyptian Government, however, were reluctant to run the line at a loss, or to have Palestine run it on Egyptian soil; while the Suez Canal Directors in their refusal to consider the possibility of a bridge over the Canal had been purely obstructive.Sir George Barstow stated that he was taking up the matter with the Egyptian Government, and if possible, with the Suez Canal Directors also.Letter from Sir George Barstow to Sir Herbert Samuel.Dear Sir Herbert Samuel, Jerusalem., April 1, 1921.I understand that I am authorised and expected by the Treasury to settle the Palestine Estimates for 1921-22 while in this country, and I propose accordingly to do so, placing on record at the same time my observations on the financial situation in Palestine.The Revenue and Expenditure figures for the period expiring the 31st March, 1921, are expected to result in a surplus of 75,000Z.
The Estimates for 1921-22, as submitted to the Treasury, show the following figures :  Revenue, including railway receipts, 770,0007.     ...     2,214,047 Expenditure,    including    railway    expenditure,745,579/. ............     2,286,133Deficit ............ 72,086The proposals before the Treasury accordingly will result if realised in a reduction of the expected balance to 3,000/.I recognise that this result has only been reached by a severe pruning of the estimates put forward by the several Departments of the Government, and that the pressure to expand existing, and to initiate new activities of the Government, must, in the present state of development of the country, be extremely great, in order to develop new sources of wealth (and therefore of revenue), and by this means to give to the inhabitants of Palestine some tangible proofs of the benefits of the new regime.At the same time, the situation is not without disquieting features. Palestine will be trenching on a somewhat exiguous surplus in 1921-22 practically to the point of exhausting it; and unless revenue expands or expenditure falls, next year will result in a deficit.Nor is this all.(a.) The Budget figures make no provision for Public Works extraordinary, and it is intended to provide for these by a loan to be raised if possible in the course of the year. Interest and sinking fund charges will make a substantial addition to next year&apos;s charges, and although part of the loan expenditure may prove immediately remunerative, the greater part cannot bring in a return for some years.(b.) Palestine has assumed the obligation to provide for her own defence, and it is intended to implement this obligation by a Palestine Defence Force. I gather that it is intended that this force shall also provide for security in Trans-Jordania, and in so far as it does so, will not be a charge on Palestinian revenues proper. But for the year 1921-22 it seems too much to hope that the proposed allocation of 100,000/. from revenue will cover the cost even of that portion of the force which provides for Palestine itself, and the whole charge of the British garrison remains for the present on the British taxpayer.(c.) No provision has been made in the estimates for the repayment of the value of the capital assets created in Palestine by expenditure from the Vote of Credit or Army Funds. The claim of the British taxpayer in respect of such transferred assets cannot be foregone, but as you are aware, the Treasury have indicated their willingness to defer the payment of instalments until a later date, when the finances of Palestine admit of repayment. It is desirable to settle the total amount of this debt at an early date.These considerations all point to the necessity of exercising the utmost caution as regards entering upon new commitments. If savings on the estimated expenditure arise, or if revenue surpasses expectations, the savings should not be diverted to new objects of,expenditure, but should be utilised to strengthen balances. Excesses on votes must be strenuously resisted, and all possible economies effected. It might be desirable to raise new taxes, if new sources of revenue can be found and put into operation without undue political difficulty. I am aware of the difficulty of direct taxation on the model of-the Income Tax in eastern countries, but other taxation, such as Death Duties, may prove possible.I recognise&apos;, however, that the estimates for the year represent a creditable effort on the part of the Administration, in the face of great difficulties, to reach a solvent position, and subject to the foregoing observations and to certain adjust-ments, which recent developments may prove necessary, I am prepared to recommend the approval of the estimates as submitted.I will only add comments on the following points: Numbers of Staff.I have of course not had.an opportunity of going into the numbers of staff of the Departments in any detail, but for the administration of a country containing some 600,000 inhabitants, the number seems at first sight large.   Comparisons made
PALESTINE. O.P.D.A. Balances. Application to Capital Works.Of the 450,000/. balance from O.P.D.A. 302,000/. has already been spent.The available balance is therefore under 150,000/.; and of this 35,000/. may be&apos; required for Defence Force equipment.The following works are already sanctioned by his Excellency as a provisional charge against the balance in anticipation of a loan.   &apos;Jerusalem water supply ...        ...        ...       40,000Rolling stock Sleepers, payable June        ...        ...      - ...       50,000Engines (negotiations advanced)     ....        ...      72,000Roads ...        ....      , ...        ...        ...      20,000C adastral survey ...         ...        ...        ...       50,000232,000with the numbers employed in other protectorates appear to support this view. Such comparisons, are, of course, apt to be misleading, and the difficulties of carrying on a trilingual administration and those incidental to the present period of recon-struction in Palestine are possibly unique. I understand, however, that it is your own view that the number of British officials has now reached its maximum and may be expected to fall. Experience in the Civil Service at home shows how extremely difficult it is to effect drastic&apos; reductions of staff as work diminishes. The existence of a superfluous number of officials tends to clog the wheels of administration, and to add a heavy burden increasing as salaries rise on an incremental scale to the country&apos;s finances. It is therefore to the general interest and not least to that of officials who may find themselves declared redundant after a short time, to keep down staffs to the lowest degree compatible with efficiency, and to provide any special additions required on a temporary footing.Motor Cars.The number of motor cars employed on official service strikes me as large. Here, again, special conditions, not applicable in other administrations, may no doubt obtain: but considerable economies can be effected by a careful supervision of the use of cars. In the Home Civil Service, the placing of all cars available for public use in the charge of a single Department resulted first in a large reduction of user, and secondly in the complete abolition of the common pool of cars in London, and while other means of transport are readily available in London, I would suggest that economies may be practicable in this direction. I was glad to receive an assurance that the question was&apos; being actively pursued here, and that arrangements are in contemplation to make a charge for the private use of Government cars.Palestine Defence Force.The procedure now proposed is, I understand, that the cost of the force shall not appear on the Palestine budget, but in lieu a contribution to defence expenditure of 100,000/. shall be made to the Colonial Office to meet part of the cost of the force. I am prepared to agree that in the circumstances of this year 100,000/. would be as much as can be paid from revenue, but further questions, such as what provision should be made from revenue in subsequent years, and the arrangements for payment in respect of stores received from the War Office, must stand over until they can be considered by the authorities at home. The balance in excess of 100,000/. of the cost of the force debitable to Palestine will, I understand, be met from the surplus balances in your hands arising from O.P.D.A. will be paid over to the Colonial Office.
If the loan is not obtained before six months the following sums would pronably be expended before the 1st October, 1921. Jerusalem water supply ...        ...        ...       40,000Railway Sleepers    ...        ...        ...        .......       50,000Engines    ... ..        ...        ...        ...        7,000Roads ...        ...........20,000Cadastral survey ...        ...        .......       20,000137,000Evidently it will require the most careful management to ensure that the available balances are not exhausted by the capital expenditure provisionally being met from them.Having regard to the assurances given by the High Commissioner that the greatest care will be taken to confine capital expenditure within the limit of the balances available, I am prepared, on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury, to agree that the&apos; proposals in paragraph 25 of the High Commissioners despatch of the 4th February last may be carried cut, subject to the condition that as soon as loan moneys become available the whole of the advances will be repaid, and that the allocation of the whole of the accumulated O.P.D.A. revenues to defence remains unaltered.Appendix 22. Holy Places Commission.MEETING HELD AT GOVERNMENT HOUSE, JERUSALEM.Tuesday, March 29, 1921.Present:Sir Herbert Samuel. Mr. Deedes. Mr. Storrs. Mr. Richmond. Major Young.The Committee had before them a note prepared by Mr. Forbes-Adam, copy of which is attached. ,Sir Herbert Samuel said that there were three main points to be considered: Firstly, who should be the chairman ? Secondly, what should be the composition of the Commission and should the Administration be represented upon it or not? Thirdly, how were the members to be paid ?With regard to the chairmanship, he said that Mr. Sokolov had recently informed him that he had been approached in Paris by the French Government, who were very anxious that the chairman of the Commission should be a Frenchman. (This would obviously mean that he would be a Catholic.) They had hinted that in return for this they would be prepared to make certain concessions with regard to the northern frontiers of Palestine.The Committee agreed that it would: be undesirable for any religious interest to be represented as such in the person of the chairman. They considered that if the Council of the League of Nations were to be approached at all about the chair -manship this should be done by Great Britain in her capacity as mandatory Power. They were of opinion that the post would be most suitably filled by an Englishman of judicial experience, and, so far as possible, world-wide reputation.Turning to the question of the composition of the Commission, Sir Herbert Samuel put forward the suggestion that instead of a small body, as recommended by the Palestine Committee, which sat under the chairmanship of Sir John Tilley in the Foreign Office, it might be preferable for the Commission to be a much larger body on which all interests could be represented. It might include as many as twenty-four members.
Note by Mr. Forbes-Adam on the Commission for the Holy Places andReligious Questions in Palestine.1. The Palestine Committee, assisted by Father Waggett, C.F., who advised the Military Administration on religious questions in Palestine during 1919 and early in 1920, discussed at their meetings on the 26th October and the 17th December the whole question of the appointment and functions of the Holy Places Commission. Annexed to this paper will be found the relevant portion of article 95 of the Treaty of Sevres and articles 13 and 14 of the Palestine mandate dealing with the question of this Commission.Recommendations of Palestine Committee.2. The recommendations of the Committee may be summarised as follows :-(a.) Chairman.Although the appointment of the chairman of the Commission is a matter for the Council of the League of Nations, it would be advisable for His Majesty&apos;s Government as mandatory to put forward either semi-officially or privately to the Secretary-General of the League the person whom they would recommend as chairman. He should be chosen for his judicial qualifications. Father Waggett has suggested Sir S. Hoare in this connection. Lord Parmoor and Lord Phillimore or some ex-Lord Chancellor have also been mentioned.(b.) Membership of the Commission and Panels.The Commission should consist of six members, to be nominated by the manda-tory, and the best combination would be three Christians, two Mahommedans and one Jew. Two of the Christians would be chosen to represent the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Christians, and the third might be chosen from among the smaller sects in rotation, being in the first instance an Armenian. The Administration of Palestine should not be represented as such on the Commission. In addition to the Commission, a group of panels should be formed locally, each panel representing a[6117] &apos; UHe was strongly of opinion that the Administration of Palestine should be represented. The position would be quite impossible if the Holy Places Commission were to arrive at conclusions which gravely affected political conditions in Palestine without the Administration having an opportunity of expressing its views.The arguments for and against a larger Commission were carefully considered by the Committee, who came to the conclusion that, provided the members were not local people and were chosen as much on account of their impartiality as of their religious views, the best composition under a British chairman, as suggested above, would be two Christians (one Catholic and one Orthodox), two Moslems (both Sunni) and two Jews (one Zionist and one Orthodox), sectarian views being laid before the Commission by panels specially selected by the respective communities, but forming no part of the Commission. They considered that the best way to meet the point that the Administration should be represented on the Commission would be by the appointment of a secretary, who would act in a dual capacity as member of the Commission and representative of the Administration. They strongly recommended the selection of Father Waggett for this post.With regard to payment, there appeared to be three alternatives: (a.) Payment by the League of Nations. (b.) Payment by His Majesty&apos;s Government. (c.) Payment from Palestine revenues.They considered that these alternatives should be tried in the order named, the third alternative being, in their opinion, most undesirable, since the functions which the Commission would perform could not fairly be described as in the interests of the taxpayer of Palestine.They recommended that the Colonial Office should approach the Foreign Office as soon as possible, inviting concurrence in the views of the Committee and asking that they might be furnished with a list of the individuals whom it was proposed to appoint in order that the High Commissioner for Palestine might have an oppor-tunity of expressing his views before any invitation was actually issued to them.
religions interest or interests, and its numbers being fixed by the main Commission. These panels would act in an advisory capacity and be called as occasion arose to assist the main Commission in dealing with any question peculiarly the concern of the sect represented&apos;by that panel. The right to come to the Commission as claimants or witnesses would not be limited by the institution of panels.(c.) Possible Members oj the Commission.Father Waggett put forward the names of the Archimandrite Timotheos Themeles as a suitable representative of the Orthodox Church, Dom Chapman, O.S.B., Bishop Couturier, O.P., Pere Abel, O.P., Pere la Grange (possibly, however, persona ingrata to the Vatican) and Cardinal Canisei (an Italian) as suitable representatives of the Roman Catholic Church, and Boghos Nubar Pasha as^a suit-able representative of the Armenians, It was suggested that the two Moslem repre-sentatives might represent the Sunni and Shiah sects respectively, or Palestine and extra-Palestine Moslems respectively, and that the Emir Feisal might advise as to the best method of selecting them. It was also suggested that the Grand Rabbi should be approached regarding a suitable Jewish representative.(d.) Method of Selection.Steps should be taken to sound some of the persons recommended as to their willingness to accept membership of the Commission, though definite offers could not be made to them until the conditions of remuneration for their services and the source whence such remuneration should come have been settled.(e.) Expenses of Commission.As soon as the Council of the League has approved the mandate, His Majesty&apos;s representative on the Council should be instructed to suggest to the Council that in view of the international importance of the Commission and its objects the travelling expenses and a maintenance allowance for the members of the main Commission should be paid by the League. It was realised at the same time by the Committee that there was properly no obligation on the League to pay, except, perhaps, in the case of the chairman.Secretaryship of the Commission.3. On Sir John Tilley&apos;s suggestion, Father Waggett has also been approached with regard to accepting the post of secretary. He has since stated that he thinks that he could be of most service if he actually had a seat on the Commission and acted as secretary. The Governor of Jerusalem, Mr. Storrs, who has been consulted, strongly supports this suggestion of Father Waggett&apos;s. He says that owing to nis peculiar local knowledge and his tact, Father Waggett would be of enormous service to the Commission and: most acceptable to the representatives of the local religious communities (both large and small). He is liked also by the foreign representatives at Jerusalem and has many friends among both the Moslems and the Jews.&apos; He could be appointed as a seventh member (apart from the chairman) and acting secretary.Pay.4. The question of pay seems to raise a big difficulty. If the League of Nations will pay the whole of the expenses, well and good, but it seems most unlikely that Japan and other members of the League, who are not really interested in the question of the Holy Places, will be prepared to share. Moreover, the League may well argue that apart from the chairman the mandatory has undertaken to establish the Corn-mission and appoint the members and should therefore pay. There can be no question of asking the interested Governments to pay because the appointments are to be expressly representative of religious, not political interests. It also seems difficult to ask the Churches, &amp;c, to pay, because we want to keep the appointments in the mandatory&apos;s hands, and they will probably refuse to pay unless they appoint. On the other hand, ,it would be unfair on the Palestine Administration to make the Commission a charge on the exiguous Palestine funds. Interests outside Palestine are really concerned and the Administration itself has nothing to do with the Corn-mission, only the mandatory. In the circumstances, if the League refuses to pay, the only way out seems to be for the mandatory to pay the actual travelling expenses of the members of the Commission and to make it clear to each Commissioner that

All responsibility in connection with the Holy Places and religious build-ings or sites in Palestine, including that of preserving existing rights, of securing free access to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites and the free exercise of worship, while ensuring the requirements of public order and decorum, is assumed by the mandatory, who will be responsible solely to the League of Nations in all matters connected therewith; provided that nothing in this article shall prevent the mandatory from entering into such arrangement as he may deem reasonable with the Administration for the purpose of carrying the provisions of this article into effect; and provided also that nothing in this mandate shall be construed as confer-ring upon the mandatory authority to interfere with the fabric or the management of purely Moslem sacred shrines, tne immunities of which are guaranteed.14. In accordance with article 95 of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey, the mandatory undertakes to appoint as soon as possible a special Commission to study and regulate all questions and claims relating to the different religious communities. In the composition of this Commission the religious interests concerned will be taken into account. The chairman of the Commission will be appointed by the Council of the League of Nations. It will be the duty of this Commission to ensure that certain Holy Places, religious buildings or sites regarded with special veneration by the adherents of one particular religion, are entrusted to the permanent control of suit-able bodies representing the adherents of the religion concerned. The selection of the Holy Places, religious buildings or sites so to be entrusted shall be made by the Commission subject to the approval of the mandatory.In all cases dealt with under this article, however, the right and duty of the mandatory to maintain order and decorum in the place concerned shall not be affected and the buildings and sites will be subject to the provisions of such laws relating to public monuments as may be enacted in Palestine with the approval of the mandatory.The rights of control conferred under this article will be guaranteed by the League of Nations.[6117]he must make his own arrangements with his local community at Jerusalem to main-tain him while the Commission is sitting. Mr. Storrs thinks the kind of people whom Father Waggett has suggested for membership would gladly serve on such terms and the local communities would probably assist. Money for the expenses of a small and permanent secretariat for the Commission would still have to be provided, perhaps half by the Administration and half by the Imperial Government as manda-tory, or, more fairly, altogether by the latter. . The charge should not be a large one.5. Presumably, in view of the impending transfer to the Colonial Office, we should take no action on the above recommendations and suggestions. The Colonial Office will be responsible, as the Department in charge of the mandatory control, for the Commission and its members, and we should not tie their hands in advance in any way.   The above proposals mav, however, be of value to them.(Initialled)        E. G. F. ADAM.January 19.
Appendix 23.-Deputations.Official Reports of (1.) Deputation of Executive Committee of the Haifa Congress.(2.) Deputation of Representatives of the Jewish Community.With Replies by Mr. Churchill, his speech at the Hebrew University site, and a minute by Sir Herbert Samuel on the memorandum of the Haifa Congress Committee.OFFICIAL REPORT.Deputation of Executive Committee of the Haifa Congress received by the Secretary of State for the Colonies at Government House, Monday, March 28, 1921.PRESIDENT of the Haifa Congress, Musa Kazim Pasha, presented the following memorandum : When Palestine emerged from the Great War she found herself tied down and her adversary, sword in hand, bending over her. She found herself, too, separated from her surrounding Arab sisters by vast distances which she had covered by running after an imaginary friend. But she found no friend, she found an enemy, rather.This is the story of Palestine, land of miracles and the supernatural, and the cradle of religions. She neither complained nor was unfaithful to her first friend, but when sorrow filled her breast she breathed a sigh and dropped a tear, and, lo, the Third Arab Palestine Congress was born. This congress, therefore, is a true repre-sentative of Palestine, her mouthpiece. In it all classes are legally represented. Town, village, factory and farm in fact, all the live aspects of the nation acknow-ledged its leadership.But the enemy of Palestine, ever on the watch, has willed to distort the truth, and to paint Palestine to the Government other than she really is by questioning the representative status of the members of the congress. To such an extent were these intrigues carried that Sir Herbert Samuel became suspicious and would not recog-nise the congress. It was then that the whole nation rose as one man and from Dan to Beersheba cried out backing the congress, and calling upon the Government to recognise it as their true and legal representative. Unfortunately these peaceful demonstrations were powerless to convince the High Commissioner of the good faith of the people of Palestine, so he persisted in ignoring their congress, knowing full well that this was their one hope and their true spokesman; whilst, on the other hand, he recognised Zionist Congresses, congratulated them, encouraged them and wished them good luck.The friendship of the Arab for the Englishman is too obvious to require proof. While still a member of the Ottoman Empire, the Arabs&apos; leaning towards England brought down on them the wrath of the Turk, who, as soon as the Great War started, used this as an excuse for venging himself on the Arabs, who were tortured, perse-cuted, exiled and killed. This was not all. The Arab suffered on account of his love for England. When the opportunity presented itself to their leader, King Hussein, he rose in revolt against the Turk, and joined Britain and her Allies, heedless of the fact that in so doing he was combatting an Islamic Power to whom he was bound by many strong and permanent ties. The tears and the blood of the Arab flowed with the tears and the blood of the Allies. More than this, all Arabs, Moslems and Christians alike were called upon to join this war. And so it came to pass that Arabs who were out of the reach of the Turk proclaimed open war against him, and started a secret propaganda amongst those within his Empire. Thousands of Arabs deserted from the Turkish ranks in consequence. To prove this we will quote here the report sent to German headquarters by General Leman von Sanders. He wrote: &quot; I have come to Palestine and Syria and found everything against us. The country has been poisoned, and its inhabitants have turned their backs on us.
We are living amongst enemies, consequently all our efforts are in vain. We are between two foes-the inhabitants of the country and the enemy we are fighting.&quot;The moment demoralisation crept into the Turkish army Palestinians began openly to point out to the invading troops the weaknesses of the Turks, thus making the conquest of the country an easier task than it would have been had the popula-tion been hostile. All this was done in good faith, and without any heed to consequences. The Arabs trusted that such fidelity would be remembered by Great Britain, who had given such binding oaths to their leader, King Hussein.The Arab did not dislike the Turk because he was Turk, neither did he love the Englishman because he was British; he hated the one because he desired complete independence, and he loved the other hoping and believing that the Englishman would help him to attain this goal. But the Arab was ambitious, he wanted all and lost all. Palestine, one of our most sacred lands, has been isolated for a thought-out purpose, and this has been the reward of the Allies to the Arabs for -their fidelity and the blood they sacrificed; nay, this is their reward for having risen in revolt against their Islamic Ruler. This, too, is their punishment for having thrown themselves so confidingly into the arms of Great Britain and her Allies a punish-ment not visited even on Germany, their greatest foe.Finding their country thus torn up, the Arabs lost faith in Britain. Their wise men, however, assured them that England was too far-sighted to allow anything to come between her and the Arabs. Further, they believed that right, although vanquished for a time, must win in the end.Confident in the justice of their cause, the Arabs are convinced that this unnatural partitioning of their lands must one day disappear. It would be a grand task for England-the traditional friend of the Arab to accomplish this reunion, and thereby gain the Arabs. For the Arabs are the key to the East, and they possess its doors and passes. Arabia, on the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, is the way to India, and Palestine, on the Mediterranean, holds to-day the balance between the Powers.Fleets and armies cannot conquer the heart of a nation. England could have conquered the Arabs&apos; hearts by safeguarding their country&apos;s integrity. Then all these huge millions required for the upkeep of her large armies would be saved to her and her taxpayer.The relation of Turk to Arab should teach England a lesson. Submitting to the Turk from necessity, the moment the Great War started the Arab seized his opportunity and threw off the yoke. To-day the Arab&apos;s belief in England is not what it was. This is to be deplored, for the Arab is noble and large-hearted; he is also vengeful, and never forgets an ill-deed. If England does not take up the cause of the Arabs, other Powers - will. From India, Mesopotamia, the Hedjaz and Palestine the cry goes up to England&apos; now. If she does not listen, then perhaps Russia will take up their call some day, or perhaps even Germany. For though to-day Russia&apos;s voice is not heard in the councils of the nations, yet the time must come when it will assert itself.In the interests of universal peace, therefore, if not for love of the Arab, England should refrain from taking this false step. Zionists can never be true to her, as they can be true to no one, and to this their mischievous work in Austria, Germany and Russia can testify. They have one and only aim in life,&quot;from which nothing can divert them.In spite of repeated warnings of the Turks to the Arabs not to throw themselves too confidingly into the arms of Great Britain, which, under the financial stress of the war, had sold their country to Zionists, the Arabs still clung to their traditional friend, believing that these warnings were inspired by nothing other than jealousy and a desire to sow seeds of strife. And when, before the conquest of Syria, the information that a compact between Great Britain and Zionists was rumoured, they refused to believe it. Then, when peace was declared, the Arabs saw with their eyes and heard with their ears that Syria and Palestine were to be separated preparatory to the carrying out of the Balfour Declaration, they realised that after all the Turks were right. They also then understood that this was done to enable Zionists to gradually become the majority in Palestine through immigration.Had Zionists come to Palestine simply as visitors, or had matters remained as before the war, there would be no question of Jew or non-Jew. It is &quot;the idea of transforming Palestine into a home for the Jews that Arabs resent and fight against. The fact that a Jew is a Jew has never prejudiced the Arab against him. Before the war Jews enjoyed all the privileges and rights of citizenship.   The question is
not a religious one. For we see that Christian and Moslem alike, whose religions are not similar, unite in their hatred of Zionists.What greatly surprises Arabs, however, is the fact that of all the Powers of Europe, England should have been the one to make this promise to the Jews, which also leads one to suspect her disinterestedness in the matter. To the Jew the National Home idea did not appeal much at first, it was England who created it, put life into it, and carried it into execution even before the ratification of the mandate by the League of Nations. According to the present rate of immigration Jews will in a few years compose a large proportion of the population, and consequently claim a larger share in the Government of the country.England, moreover, disregarding the feelings of the inhabitants,&apos; has appointed a Jew as High Commissioner. With every respect to the person of Sir Herbert Samuel, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that the predominating majority of the people he governs are not of his own race or faith. It would have been a wiser policy to have appointed an Arab to this high post. In Syria, France, acting more in sympathy with the inhabitants, appoints natives to fill exalted positions, and reserves to herself the right of council and advice.Again, to the most important post of justice in Palestine, namely that of Legal Secretary, or Minister of Justice, a Jew has been appointed. And what is worse, this official, is an out and out Zionist. In a book he recently wrote he strongly advocates the quiet persecution of the Arab in order to force him finally to quit the country.We will now proceed to dissect the Balfour Declaration, and to show how to the Arab, the Palestinian and the Britisher it is strongly prejudicial.(a.) From a Legal Point of View.1. Before drawing a contract with Zionists for the sale of Palestine, England had drawn a contract with King Hussein by virtue of which he was to be given Arab lands. Consequently the contract with King Hussein annuls that with&apos; the Jews. In the eye of the Jew the first is valid and the second is not. Shall it go down to history then, that England was false to her plighted word through Mr. Balfour, and was it not for the sake of a plighted word to the Belgians that she unsheathed her sword in the Great War?2. King Hussein paid a price for his contract by rising against the Turks. This was his part of the contract. England&apos;s contract with the Jews, therefore, can have no legal value as long as King Hussein is ignorant of it. So far, then, as the Arabs are concerned the Balfour Declaration is not valid.Besides, there were understandings with France and Russia before this declaration was made; consequently, though France was influenced to include it in the mandate, international law cannot give it a legal status.3. Countries with their civic and other rights and privileges are the property of their inhabitants and constitute an heirloom of the nation, handed down from father to son. Now the people of Palestine inherited this country from their ancestors, as these did from those who had gone before them. Palestine, therefore, with its air, water, lands and roads, commerce, industry and agriculture, is in inalienable possession of the nation, and neither England nor any other Power can bring a foreigner in to share this inheritance. But Palestinians are gradually losing their birthright through Jewish immigration, and thanks to Mr. Balfour&apos;s Declaration, which was denounced in the press, from the pulpit and before the American Commission.But it might be argued that Mr. Balfour spoke on behalf of the British Cabinet of which he is a member. But even this does not give his declaration any legal validity, since Great Britain, though occupying the country, does not possess it. Putting aside for one moment Mr. Wilson&apos;s Fourteen Points and the repeated assertions of the Allies that they were not out in this war for colonisation or self-aggrandisement, we find in international law that a conquering people can lay hands only on the personal possessions of the defeated Power and on its rights and privileges, but that it has no right to touch anything that belongs to private persons.In the light of international law, then, Mr. Balfour&apos;s declaration is an act of modern Bolshevism, pure and simple.4. One of the great laws governing international treaties is that the two parties should possess the quality of government. A treaty between a governing Power and an individual cannot have international force.
Now the contract between Great Britain and Zionists over Palestine is one between a Great Power and a company of men who are neither a Power nor a nation. In fact, it is a contract between England and a collection of history, imagination and ideals existing only in the brains of Zionists who are a company, a commission but not a nation. Is it right or just, then, that a treaty concluded with King Plussein should be made null and void by one made with Zionists?For thousands of years Jews have been scattered over the earth, and have become nationals of the various nations amongst whom they settled. They have no separate political or lingual existence. In Germany they are Germans, in France Frenchmen, and in England Englishmen. Religion and language are their only tie. But Hebrew is a dead language and might be discarded. How then could England conclude a treaty with a religion and register it in the League of Nations? Nay, rather, how could the Jews themselves agree to this treaty ? For if there exists a Jewish Power and a Jewish nation, what is the status,, amongst others, of those high Jewish officials who are serving England to-day? Are they Jewish nationals or English nationals, for. it is obvious they cannot be both at the same time ?Sir Herbert Samuel and Lord Reading are Englishmen and Jews. Now if Jew-ism is a nationality what about their English-ism ? One -ism must be sacrificed for the other, but which for which ?Besides, this promise was made long before British troops came into possession of Palestine, and since this victory was an Allied one, France, Italy and the Arabs having taken active parts in it, the consent of all should be secured before any gift is made. But the Arabs have not been consulted, and never will consent, and Russia, when it wakes up, will have a word to say.5. There can be no question that Palestine belongs legally to the Arabs. They inherited it from their ancestors and have been occupying it for more than twenty centuries. The Jews saw, knew and accepted this fact. Now, had they any right to own Palestine they would have contested our occupation of it long ago, or at least, lodged a protest against us. But they did nothing of the kind, knowing full well they had nothing to claim.Moreover, in the days of the Turks, the Jews, the great majority of whom were nationals of European Governments and consequently protected by the Capitulations, could have used their privileges and the weakness of the Turkish Government to extort at least some official recognition of their claim to Palestine. In fact, some European Powers would have abetted and encouraged them in their demands. But no claim was made, and native Palestinians remained undisturbed in the possession of their country.After all this can anyone doubt that Palestine belongs to the Arabs, and that the Balfour Declaration is a gross injustice.(b.) Historical Point of View.Zionists and Great Britain appeal to history in confirmation of their claim. Because at one period of history the Jews conquered this land and lived in it, hence, it is argued, they possess it for ever.The argument contains more of poetry in it than logic. According to it the Arabs should claim Spain since once upon a time they conquered it and there developed a high civilisation. Why then should Palestine be given back to the Jews and Spain remain in the hands of Spaniards ? The Turks too, at one time conquered all the Balkan States right up to Vienna, why does Europe then keep these back from them ?Even while in possession of Palestine for about 4,000 years the Jews&apos; right to it was always contested by their neighbours. Wars, revolts, religious and political agitations and internal troubles filled the whole period; and it was only during the reign of King Soloman that peace prevailed. But the Arabs&apos; reign in Palestine was undisturbed for a long time until the Crusaders arrived, and then they bought the country again, for the second time, after having once bought it from the Romans, by shedding rivers of blood. Besides, they were always at peace with their neighbours  an achievement which the Israelites cannot claim.It might be argued, too, that the Jews&apos; claim to Palestine rests on the monuments and buildings which their ancestors built and left behind them. As a matter of fact, no nation in history has left less behind it than the Jews; and those temples and monuments established by them in their golden age disappeared before the nation was scattered.
But if ancient monuments establish a claim, what about Arab and Turkish monuments in Europe to-day; and does not every ruin in Palestine bespeak Arab origin.It is surprising to think that students of ancient Jewish history interest them-selves in the religion and kingly glory of this people and neglect that other part of it dealing with revolts, mutinies, internal troubles, and those wars with their neighbours which finally led to their expulsion from the land. Have statesmen ever found out the reason why the Israelites could not get on with their neighbours, or why they were so detested by all surrounding tribes ? We believe that such a study would reveal points that may prove very helpful to modern diplomacy and statecraft.Arabs, on the other hand, have lived here for centuries at peace with all their neighbours, and even the very long reign of the Turks was not able to change the character of the land or to Turkify its inhabitants.(c.) Moral Roint of View.Jews have been amongst the most active advocates of destruction in many lands, especially where their influential positions have enabled them to do more harm. It is well known that the disintegration of Russia was wholly or in great part brought about by the Jews, and a large proportion of the defeat of Germany and Austria must also be put at their door. When the star of the Central Powers was in the ascendant Jews flattered them, but the moment the scale turned in favour of the Allies Jews withdrew their support from Germany, opened their coffers to the Allies, and received in return that most uncommon promise.We have seen a book entitled &quot; The Jewish Peril&quot; which should be read by everyone who still doubts the pernicious motives of the Jews towards the Powers that be and towards civilisation. It is a collection of the minutes of a secret society of prominent Jews who meet from time to time to discuss world affairs in relation to Judaism. The book is replete with an overflowing hatred of mankind, and Christendom in particular. It points out in detail ways and means for upsetting the present order of things, so that out of the ensuing chaos Jews might come out masters of the world.Looking into the ranks of socialism, we find Jewish names such as Carl Marx, Becknin and Trotsky topping the list, besides a host of others as pernicious, if not as renowned.The Jew, moreover, is clannish and unneighbourly, and cannot mix with those who live about him. He will enjoy the privileges and benefits of a country, but will give nothing in return. The Jew is a Jew all the world over. He amasses the wealth of a country and then leads its people, whom he has already impoverished, where he chooses. He encourages wars when self-interest dictates, and thus uses the armies of the nations to do his bidding.Palestine suffers in this manner from&apos; her Jewish colonies. Wherever these exist the surrounding peasant population has had to sell out and migrate. Because of their clannishness Jews will, as far as they can help it, not employ a native, or buy at his store or benefit him in any way; on the contrary, they will watch every opportunity to harm him if this can be done with impunity,In commerce and finance they are pitiless foes. Since Palestine opened its doors to them its trade has gradually drifted into their hands. They depreciate the value of land and property, and at the same time manipulate a financial crisis in order that landlords, under the stress of need, should sell out at ruinous prices.Can Europe then expect the Arab to live and work with such a neighbour? Had not England better find a country for them in the vast uninhabited regions of her great Empire?If Russia and Poland, with their spacious countries, were unable to tolerate them, how could Europe expect Palestine to welcome them ? Can the Arabs carry the burden which Europe is unable to support; or will the Jew, on coming to Palestine, change his skin and lose all those qualities which have hitherto made him an object of dislike to the nations ?(d.) Economic Point of View.1. But there are economic difficulties in Mr. Balfour&apos;s declaration which render it valueless in our view.Under Turkish rule the whole Empire was one big field for the trade of the Palestinian.    From Constantinople to Mesopotamia and from the Red Sea to the
Indian Ocean there was one system of customs, passports and coinage. To-day all this has changed. Goods sent to Damascus or Bey rout are charged double customs, merchants going north or east must have passports, which entail delays, expense and worry. All this is bad for&apos;business.Now the Palestinian merchant is comparatively poor, while Zionists have wealth; consequently, they will be able soon to compete with him, crush and drive him out of the market. This done, they will turn on the consumer and force him to accept their prices. To say trade is free does not help matters. In Europe Govern-ments endeavour by laws and taxation to protect their trade; why does not the Government here do likewise ?2. Palestine is an agricultural country, and depends largely on her export of cereals for a living. Now Jewish immigration has raised the cost of living, and the Government, in order to keep prices down in the interest of the Jewish consumer, has prohibited the export of certain cereals, with the result that the granaries of the land are stocked with products, and merchants cannot find an outlet for their trade. Consequently, a financial crisis set in and hundreds of merchants were bankrupt. Now, if this is the policy of Zionists while they still form a small minority, what will it be when they become more numerous ?Again, Palestine was ruined by the war, and is in dire need of money. The Jews started their campaign of advancing money on land and property. This can have one and only one conclusion; Jews will finally buy up these mortgaged lands, oust the owners, and rule in their places.3.&apos;Again, in order to bring Palestine up to the level of European countries, the Government, in spite of the poverty of the people, has started a series of innovations and improvements which, though useful, are not so keenly needed at the present moment. It has opened up new unnecessary roads, repaired old ones which fully served their purposes, widened some railway lines, and created new gardens. The poor taxpayer has been burdened with costs. On the other hand,needs of more vital importance, such as public education, have been grudged their due budgets. Recognising the benefits of these improvements, we would like our Treasury not to exceed its financial capacity, but to go slow, putting what is vital and essential before that which is a comparative luxury.The above-mentioned works, too, are undertaken more in order to give employ-ment to the thousands of Jewish immigrants than because they are immediate necessities. The Jewish labourer on these works is paid double the amount given to the native, though he does less work.Ever since the High Commissioner took the reins of office he has been considering the floating of a loan for public works, or, in other words, he wants to borrow money in the name of the native taxpayer in order to help out Jewish immigrants. Is it not enough that the highest posts with fat salaries are given to the Jews, while the native official, who is more conversant with local needs, is relegated to a third-class position, with a salary too little for his needs and out of all proportion with his work ?(e.) Expense to the British Government.Thanks to the back-sliding efforts of Zionists, the Government has come to consider natives as enemies with whom1 she should always be on her guard. Conse-quently, a huge army is maintained in order to keep them quiet. Seven millions a year have been quoted as a moderate estimate for this army. Who is to pay? Certainly not the Palestine Treasury, as its whole income does not come up to one-third of this amount. Is it to be accumulated as a debt on the country to be paid when better days set in ? We do not think the British Government would ever do such a thing. But if England pays what would her taxpayer say ? If Zionists lent this amount the interest on the money would be enormous. The British taxpayer would hardly be expected to pay willingly seven millions a year for something which is valueless to him.Yes, the British army in Palestine is of immense value to the Jews, and it is to their interest and safety that it is kept.(f.) Political Effects.We would call the attention of Great Britain to the following three points : 1. Zionists are ambitious. If to-day they accept the mandate of England they may.not do so to-morrow.  Their one aim is to establish a Jewish kingdom, bring[6117] X
back the glory of Israel in the &quot; Land of Promise,&quot; and gradually control the world. This ideal is expressed by their leader, Mr. Herzel, and by other Jewish writers. Already they complain that England has given them less than she promised. Here is their first word of ingratitude. They propose that a J wish army be created to take the place of British troops. In this we have a foretaste of what is to come, for, once they are strong enough, they will turn their backs on England as they did on Germany and Russia.2. If England goes out of Egypt, how would she like to see the keeping of the eastern side of the Suez Canal in the hands of a Jewish State.3. Egypt, India, Mesopotamia, Arabia, and Palestine, all these countries are a chain in &quot;the East; what takes place in the one finds an echo in them all, since not only have they similar customs and habits, but also the same religion. Now, as soon as this National Home is realised, there will migrate into Palestine the undesirables of Russia and Poland men and women imbued with Bolshevism, poor and uneducated. As soon as Zionists cease to aid these they will revolt against them, against the Government and against society.Economic troubles in which natives of Palestine were invited to take part have actually occurred many a time already, and it was only through the assistance of the Government that they were not allowed to spread. Now, if such things can happen to-day, when the number of immigrants is small, how will it be when they number hundreds of thousands, and who can guarantee that during some future trouble the natives, who are poor and ignorant, will again refuse to join.Once Bolshevism spreads in Palestine it will quickly extend to other Arab peoples, who are free and democratic by nature, and who possess little more than their swords and emotions.Will England, who should be the greatest foe of Bolshevism, be pleased to see it grow in Palestine and from it spread into Arab lands ?Observations on the Mandate.When the Great War was over the Allies, in conformity with Mr. Wilson&apos;s Fourteen Articles, recognised the principle of self-determination for smaller nations. An American Commission was sent out to the East to learn the wish of the people. All declared in favour of independence and national government. But statesmen saw differently, and, in spite of the Fourteen Articles, created: the novel principle of mandate. The nation, however, has not departed from its original purpose, and protests most strongly against the terms of the mandate as they appeared in the &apos;&apos;Jewish Chronicle.&quot; Though we reserve to ourselves the right of claiming the carrying out of our demands as expressed to the American Commission, we will here discuss certain essential aspects of-this mandate.1. The mandate is based on article 22 of the League of Nations, which gives certain rights to smaller peoples, who are divided into three classes according to their progress in civilisation and their capacity for self-government. Nations of the first class can be self-governing, the Mandatory Power rendering only counsel and help; while mandates of the second class give the Mandatory Power the right to share in the international administration of the nation.Palestinians do not know to what class they belong. England has kept us out of the first class entirely, though she does not say so in plain terms. The words of the mandate do not mention the article of the League from which this Mandatory Power is derived.  Plainness here would have been more to the purpose.It can be shown, however, from the very terms of the mandate that we belong to the third class.   And here are the proofs : In article 1 we read that the Mandatory Power has the right to exercise the power inherent in the Government of a sovereign State. We would ask what power ? and how is the exercise of this power compatible with self-government ?Again, in article 2 it is stated that the Mandatory Power shall have full powers to provide for public ownership or control of any of the natural resources of the country. Are these powers, again we ask, in keeping with self-government granted to nations of the first category ? We have gone carefully through the mandate, but can find in it no hope. There is some encouragement for self-government, but how tp harmonise this with what is actually taking place is the problem.
Further, we find that the mandate refers to what is congenial to it in the League of Nations, and leaves out entirely what is favourable to the Arabs. But the article allows much to depend on the wish of the nation. Has Great Britain learnt our wishes 1 She knows them, but refuses to carry them through. We have made these wishes known to the American Commission and to Great Britain through various protests and congresses. Has the Government or the League of Nations removed this condition from the article, or it is valid for all countries excepting Palestine ?Lord Curzon declared that the people of Palestine would certainly object to the principle of a National Home and all that this involves.Besides, the failure of the Government to declare the nature of this mandate must give birth to endless troubles in the future with the League of Nations. Palestine should be treated like Syria and Mesopotamia, at least, for she is not below them in her capacity for self-government.France, by the mouth of M. Poincare and others, has made plain her position in Syria. She is to give counsel and advice. Is England to be less liberal than France and usurp powers in Palestine which her great ally has so generously left in the hands of the natives of Syria.2. Again, we do not see where the Jews come in in the mandate, and where the Government derives her right of handing over to them Crown lands which are not her own. Nor can we see why the Zionist Commission should be appointed as the Government&apos;s advisory body on all economic questions and public works. These Crown lands are the property of the nation, and belong to the tenants who from time immemorial have lived on them and cultivated them. The Government, therefore, cannot give them over to the Jews.Further, by what right did the Government appoint the Zionist Commission to share with it the execution of public works to the exclusion of all other bodies \3. The mandate is replete with the assurance that our civil and religious rights would be strictly observed. This is quite superfluous, as no Government on earth, however low its ideals, dare interfere with religious tenets of a people. Conse-quently, the assurance grants nothing new. The Turks, who are an Islamic Power, never interfered in the religious exercises of other communities; nay, more, they went to a great deal of trouble and expense to safeguard the due exercise of these religions, and demanded no recognition of gratitude from1 them, believing this to be her bounden duty as a Government.As to our civic rights, these two mean nothing more than that equality and justice will be given us before the law. Obviously no privilege is contained in this. On the other hand, the Jews &quot;have been granted a true advantage, namely, that of becoming our rulers. We are to have equal rights of justice with them before the law, but they are to have in addition to this the preference in politics and in economic life of the country, of which the mandate has seen fit to deprive us.4. Then, again, the country is called upon to share in the upkeep of a large army, for which there is not the slightest need, since all the neighbouring States are Arab and friendly, except to safeguard the principles of a National Home, and to burden the country with a load of debt, under which it can never aspire to independence in the future.The whole country awaited the coming of the English with boundless joy, but as soon as these arrrived and their policy began to unfold itself disappointment reigned everywhere.Under the Turks we governed ourselves through our representative Parliament, and the only Turkish official in our midst was the Wali or Mutesarrif, who had his advisory native-elected council to help him. In the majority of cases even these officials were from amongst ourselves. In the courts, too, all the judges and members of the bench were natives, and each one of us could work up to the highest legal position. There were schools for each branch of civic activity, whose graduates were employed in their several specific departments. Governors understood the language of the people they governed, taxation was low. We had the right to criticise the Government in the press, at public meetings and from pulpits.Now all this has changed. We have no voice or say in the government of the country, no representative Parliament. The legal secretary, with a few under him, are the source of our laws and legal system, in spite of the fact that the treaty with Turkey has not yet been signed and the mandate not ratified. The highest posts are given to foreigners. The Legal Secretary and the Director of Commerce are Jews. Fabulous salaries are allowed to officials incompetent to do the work, while competent natives are granted a mere pittance. Unnecessary posts are created to give emplov-[6117] ^ . X 2
ment to officials, while others, vital to the running of the country, are suspended. The native press is tied down to a narrow circle, and for the most innocent expires-sions of opinion fines are imposed, often followed by imprisonment, while Zionists carry out their daily campaigns against the natives with impunity. Travelling in the country and out of it has been so hemmed in with difficulties and expense, and the export trade has been so regulated, that men prefer to stop where they are and accumulate their stocks of cereals rather than submit to unreasonable worries.For all the above reasons, we ask in the name of justice and right that First: The principle of a National Home for the Jews be abolished.Second: A. National Government be created, which shall be responsible to a parliament elected by the Palestinian people who existed in Palestinebefore the war.Third: A stop be put to Jewish immigration until such a time as a national government is formed. Fourth: Paws and regulations before the war be still carried out and all othersframed after the British occupation be annulled, and no new laws be createduntil a National Government comes into being. Fifth: Palestine should not be separated from her sister States.For the Executive Committeeof the Arab Palestine Congress : (Signed)        MOUSA KAZEM EL-HUSSAINI, President.REPLY BY MR. CHURCHILL.LET me make it clear in the first place why it is I am receiving you here. I came out to Cairo to hold a conference mainly about Mesopotamia, and my friend Sir Herbert Samuel invited me, as I was so close, to come on up and pay him a visit in Palestine, so as to be able to see something of the country and to discuss with him some of its problems on the spot. You must not suppose that my coming here in any way supersedes him. He is the responsible representative of the Crown in Palestine, and any direction which I may give in the name of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment I shall send by despatches from London in the usual way after full considera-tion with my other advisors at home. But as I was here in the country some of you asked to come to see me, and at the request of the High Commissioner I have done so as a matter of courtesy and of goodwill and not in any.sense as a formal conference.Now I think it always best to be as plain as possible in everything that is said, so that there cannot possibly be any misunderstanding. In the very able paper which you have read, there are a great many statements of fact which we do not think are true, and I think everyone of you knows in his heart that it must be taken as a partisan statement and one side of the case rather than as a calm judicial summing up of what is best for us all to do in the difficult circumstances in which we find ourselves. But still, as you have said all that you feel you ought to say, you will, I am sure, wish me to reply with equal candour. The great thing is to know exactly where we are.You have asked me in the first place to repudiate the Balfour Declaration and to veto immigration of Jews into Palestine. It is not in my power to do so, nor, if it were in my power, would it be my wish. The British Government have passed their word, by the mouth of Mr. Balfour, that they will view with favour the estab-lishment of a National Home for JeWs in Palestine, and that inevitably involves the immigration of Jews into the country. This declaration of Mr. Balfour and of the British Government has been ratified by the Allied Powers who have been victorious in the Great War; and it was a declaration made while the war was still in progress, while victory and defeat hung in the balance. It must therefore be regarded as one of the facts definitely established by the triumphant conclusion of the Great War. It is upon this basis that the mandate has been undertaken by Great Britain, it is upon this basis that the mandate will be discharged; I have no doubt that it is on this basis that the mandate will be accepted by the Council of the League of Nations, which is to meet again shortly.
Moreover, it is manifestly right that the Jews, who are scattered all over, the world, should have a national centre and a National Home where some of them may be reunited. And where else could that be but in this land of Palestine, with which for more than 3,000 years they have been intimately and profoundly associated? We think it will be good for the world, good for the Jews and good for the British Empire. But we also think it will be good for the Arabs who dwell in Palestine, and we intend that it shall be good for them, and that they shall not be sufferers or supplanted in the country in which they dwell or denied their share in all that makes for its progress and prosperity. And here I would draw your attention to the second part of the Balfour Declaration, which solemnly and explicitly promises to the inhabitants of Palestine the fullest protection of their civil and political rights. I was sorry to hear in the paper which you have just read that you do not regard that promise as of value. It seems to be a vital matter for you and one to which you should hold most firmly and for the exact fulfilment of which you should claim. If the one promise stands, so does the other; and we shall be judged as we faithfully fulfil both.After all, the British Government has a view of its own in this matter, and we have right to such a view. Our position in this country is based upon the events of the war, ratified, as they have been, by the treaties signed by the victorious Powers. I thought, when listening to your statements, that it seemed that the Arabs of Palestine had overthrown the Turkish Government. That is the reverse of the true facts. It has been the armies of Britain which have liberated these regions. You had only to look on your road here this afternoon to see the graveyard of over 2,000 British soldiers, and there are many other graveyards, some even larger, that are scattered about in this land. The position of Great Britain in Palestine is one of trust, but it is also one of right. For the discharge of that trust and for the high purposes we have in view, supreme sacrifices were made by all these soldiers of the British Empire, who gave up their lives and their blood. Therefore I beg you to realise that wre shall strive to be loyal to the promises we have made both to the Arab and to the Jewish people, and that we shall fail neither in the one nor in the other.I would also draw your attention to&apos; the very careful and exact nature of the words which were used by Mr. Balfour. He spoke of &quot; the establishment in Pales-tine of a National Home for the Jews.&quot; He did not say he would make Palestine the National Home for the Jews. There is a difference between the two which is of great importance. The fact that Palestine shall contain .a National Home for the Jews does not mean that it will cease to be the National Home of other people, or that a Jewish Government will be set up to dominate the Arab people. On the contrary, the British Government is well disposed towards the Arabs in Palestine, and, indeed, cherish a strong friendship and desire for co-operation with the Arab race as a whole. That is what you would expect from the British Empire, which is the greatest of all the Moslem States in the world, and which must never cease to study the needs and wishes of its Moslem subjects and allies; and surely you have found that at any rate I have been assured on this point by many Moslems since my arrival here in the daily contact with the officers of this Administration in Palestine; that they make no distinction as between Arab and Jew, and that they endeavour in every way to render impartial, even-handed justice.We regard this matter of such importance that we moved His Majesty the King to appoint Sir Herbert Samuel as High Commissioner. He has held very high office in&quot; our own country, and he has many years experience in our Parliamentary and Cabinet life. Therefore in selecting him we knew we had a trained and experienced man who would understand what ought to be done and what the full meaning and purpose of British policy was. Moreover, he is himself a Jew, and therefore we knew that in holding the balance even and securing fair treatment for all he could not be reproached for being hostile to his own people, and he would be believed by them when he said that he was only doing what was just and fair; and I think this appointment has been vindicated and justified not only by what has been done but by its results.I do not think you have any need to feel alarmed or troubled in your minds about the future. The British Government have promised that what is called the Zionist movement shallhave a fair chance in this country, and the British Govern-ment will do what is necessary to secure that fair chance. But-after, all it is only upon its merits that Zionism can succeed. We cannot tolerate the expropriation of one set of people by another or the violent trampling down of one set of national ideals for the sake of erecting another.  If a National Home for the Jews is to be
Vo&apos;2established in Palestine, as we hope to see it established, it can only be by a process which at every stage wins its way on its merits and carries with it increasing benefits and prosperity and happiness to the people of the country as a whole. And why should this not be so ? Why should this not be possible ? You can see with your own eyes in many parts of this country the work which has already been done by Jewish colonies; how sandy wastes have been reclaimed and thriving farms and orangeries planted in their stead. It is quite true that they have been helped by money from outside, whereas your people have not had a similar advantage, but surely these funds of money largely coming from outside and being devoted to the increase of the general prosperity of Palestine is one of the very reasons which should lead you to take a wise and tolerant view of the Zionist movement. The paper which you have just read painted a golden picture of the delightful state of affairs in Palestine under the Turkish rule. Every man did everything he pleased; taxation was light; justice was prompt and impartial; trade, commerce, education, the arts all florished. It was a wonderful picture. But it had no relation whatever to the truth, for other wise why did the Arab race rebel against this heavenly condition ? Obviously the picture has been overdrawn.  And what is the truth?This country has been very much neglected in the past and starved and even mutilated by Turkish misgovernment There is no reason why Palestine should not support a larger number of people than it does at present, and all of those in a higher condition of prosperity.But you will say to me, are we to be led by the hopes of material gain into letting ourselves be dispossessed in our own house by enormous numbers of strangers brought together across the seas from all over the world ? My answer is; no, that will not be, that will never be. Jewish immigration into Palestine can only come as it makes a place for itself by legitimate and honourable means; as it provides the means by which it is to be supported. The task before the Zionists is one of extraordinary difficulty. The present form of government will continue for many years, and step by step we shall develop representative institutions leading up to full self-govern-ment. All of us here to -day will have passed away from the earth and also our children and our children&apos;s children before it is fully achieved. The Jews will need the help of the Arabs at every stage, and I think you would be wise to give them your help and your aid and encourage them in their difficulties. They may fail, if they are not guided by wisdom and goodwill, if they do not tread the path of justice and tolerance and neighbourliness, if the class of men who come in are not worthy of the Jewish race, then they will fail and there will be an end of the experiment. But on the other hand, if they succeed, and in proportion as they do succeed year by year, such success can only be accompanied by a general diffusion of wealth and well-being among all the dwellers in Palestine and by an advance in the social, scientific and cultural life of the people as a whole.These are the words which I speak to you with great belief in their truth. I am sure if you take my advice you will not find in the future any difference in the life you have led in the past, or in the part you have played in your country, except an improvement. There will be more food, there will be more freedom, there will be more people, there will be more health among the people, there will be more know-ledge, the fruits of toil will be more securely enjoyed, and the harvests will be more fully reaped by those who have sown them. Above all there will be a complete respect for everyone&apos;s religious faith. Although the Arabs are in a large majority in Palestine and although the British Empire has accepted the mandate for Palestine, yet in a certain wider sense Palestine belongs to all the world. This city of Jerusalem itself is almost equally sacred to Moslem, Christian and Jew1 not only those who dwell in this land, but those of these three religions who all over the world look to what is the holy centre of their faith. The Arabs of Palestine have therefore a great trust which we look to them to discharge and to help us (the British Government) in discharging, and just as in the spiritual sphere the profession of one faith does not mean the exclusion of another, so in the material world there is room for all. If instead of sharing miseries through quarrels you will share blessings through co-operations, a bright and tranquil future lies before your country. The earth is a generous mother. She will produce in plentiful abundance for all her children if they will but cultivate her soil in justice and in peace.
OFFICIAL REPORT.Deputation of Representatives of the Jewish Community Received by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, on Monday, March 28, 1921.The deputation presented the following memorandum :-The Jewish National Council of Palestine, a body representative of the Jews of this country and elected by the Jewish National Assembly convened on the basis of general elections of the whole of the Palestine adult Jewish population, desire to express to you the deep feeling of gratitude of the Jewish population of Palestine towards the British Government, which was the first to declare its readiness to assist in the rebuilding of the Jewish National Home in Palestine.The Jewish people has during the long years of its exile from its land always kept alive the love of the country of its glorious past. The belief that one day the people would return to its ancient land has kept it alive under the most trying circumstances in all parts of the world, and Great Britain&apos;s promise to assist in rebuilding the National Home of Israel has filled every Jewish heart with gratitude.The Jewish people are under a further obligation of gratitude to Great Britain for accepting the mandate for Palestine, and the mission of re-establishing the Jewish National Home here in pursuance of the decision of the League of Nations. We trust that the realisation of this decision will be made possible by giving Palestine its historical frontiers and by adjusting them to the needs of its full and independent economic development, which is based on the water-power and the granaries of North and East.The Palestine Jews, and with them the Jewish people in all countries, recognise in the appointment of the Right Hon. Sir Herbert Samuel, a brother Jew, as the High Commissioner to our historical country, the first practical step towards the realisation of the declaration of the British Government given through Mr. Balfour on the 2nd November, 1917, and towards the fulfilment of the decision of the Allied Powers at San Remo on the 24th April, 1920.Sir Herbert Samuel, during the eight months he has been fulfilling the responsible task of governing Palestine, has shown not only that he is an adminis-trator of rare distinction, but that he appreciates to the full that he is the bearer of a lofty historic mission, rooted alike in the fundamental ideas of the Jewish people and in British traditions of liberty and progress. In protecting the rights of all inhabitants of the country and in furthering the interests of the whole population, the High Commissioner fulfils Mr. Balfour&apos;s declaration in its integrity.It is our constant endeavour to assist the High Commissioner in establishing cordial relations between all sections of the population, and our Jewish and Zionist programme lays special stress on the establishing of sincere friendship between ourselves and the Arabs. The Jewish people returning, after 2,000 years of exile and persecution to its own homeland, cannot suffer the suspicion that it wishes to deny to another nation its rights.i The Jewish people have full understanding of the aspirations of the Arabs with regard to a national revival, but we know that by our efforts to rebuild the Jewish National Home in Palestine, which is but a small area in comparison with all the Arab lands, we do not deprive them of their legitimate rights. On the contrary, we are convinced that a Jewish renaissance in this country can only have a strong and invigorating influence upon the Arab nation. Our kinship in language, race, character and history give the assurance that we shall in due course come to a complete understanding with them.His Excellency the High Commissioner then stated: if I thought that the fears expressed in the memorandum submitted&apos; by the deputation were well-founded I should regard the situation as very serious. But I am absolutely convinced in my heart and conscience that these fears are unfounded, and that events will prove that that is so, and when you are convinced by your own experience and by facts that these fears are unfounded, I believe that my policy of promoting good-will among the three sections of the community will yet prevail.
The two brother nations, Jews and Arabs, working together in peace and harmony, are destined to bring about the cultural and economic revival of the awakening peoples of the Near and Middle East.The history of Jewish colonisation in Palestine is a proof of the great advantages which Jewish work has brought to the inhabitants of the country. The colonies established by Jews in the course of the last forty years have changed waste areas into flourishing gardens; sandy plains, which were not or were only to a very small degree cultivated have been turned into fertile fields and colonies, the orchards and gardens of which are now worth millions of pounds and give work and food to many people. These areas, in which formerly only the herds of the wandering Bedouins grazed, and then only during a few weeks of the year, have now become closely populated settlements with factories and industries. They embrace already a population of about 15,000 people, and will be able to absorb after special technical improvements a further similar number of new settlers in the near future. Through these colonies many thousands of non-Jews of the neighbourhood ^ earn a living. Experts in all branches of science and industries are devoting their energy, their experience, and their knowledge to the development of the land, and their methods are being copied by their neighbours. Swamps which formerly bred disease and which played havoc with the first Jewish pioneers have now been changed into flourishing settlements. Industries which were unknown in this country have been established and introduced by Jews, such as iron works, cement works, factories for building materials, furniture and joinery, machinery, mills, wine cellars and soap works, printing houses. New towns have been built according to modern ideas and taste. The commerce of the country has been greatly developed, and its branches have spread and widened. Parallel with the great influx of Jewish immigrants, non-Jewish production has been developed and the standard of agriculture has been raised. The tax revenue can be taken as an illustration of this change. Forty years ago the taxes of the Rishon-le-Zion area, for instance, amounted to only a few medjidiehs (1 medjidiel^20 piastres), collected for some water mellons which the Bedouins has sown: now the taxes of this area amount to 5,0OOZ. Land has increased in value to an extent formerly unknown, and the greatest part of the sums invested by Jews, which amount to millions of pounds, have remained in the hands of the local inhabitants. Sums which would cover the educational budgets of fully-developed countries have been spent by the Jews to realise modern ideas of education and civilisation. More than 100,000/. were spent by the Zionist organisation for their school work the last year.   Our example is being followed by the Arabs.The work for the revival of the country is being continued. Besides persons of means who are building and establishing factories and developing commerce and industry, there are thousands of young men who have fled from their ruined houses in Eastern Europe to devote their strength and energy to their own country. They include teachers, physicians, students and clerks, the majority of them in the prime of life, They are labouring hard on roads and in draining marshes in order to take their part in building up the country.The Jews are anxious to take their part in the defence of their Motherland. They have proved already their readiness for sacrifice when they enlisted in thousands during the great war, from Palestine and other countries, into the Jewish battalions which fought with the British army for the liberation of Palestine. As the economic development of Palestine progresses with Jewish immigration, Jewish capital and Jewish devotion the capacity of the country for self-defence will correspondingly expand.For the rebirth of this country and the restoration of all its ancient glory, all the living forces of Jewry throughout the world must be united in a ceaseless effort. The Jewish people is ready to come forward and bring the necessary sacrifices for the great cause of its regeneration. Quickened by the belief that the foundations of its National Home have been already laid by the declaration of the British Govern-ment and the decision of San Remo, the Jewish people feels sure that the facts of daily life in Palestine will go&quot; further and further to prove that the Jewish National Home is becoming a living factor. In the recognition of the world Zionist organisation by the Mandatory Power as the representative of the Jewish people for the building of its National Home and in the recognition of Hebrew as an official language of the country, the first steps for embodying the principles of the historic declaration find their expression. And infinite trust fills the hearts of Jewry that the continuation of the work of the Mandatory Power in Palestine will bring each day nearer the realisation of the Jewish National Home in the Jews&apos; ancient country.
Mr. CHURCHILL&apos;S REPLY.I have just finished receiving a deputation representing some of the Moslem inhabitants in this country, and I have told them quite plainly that there can be no question of our departing from the principles enunciated by Mr. Balfour in his declaration. I pointed out to them that these principles are two-fold; in the first place, the British Government will favour the establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine; in the second place that process will take place without prejudice or unfairness to the existing Arab and Christian inhabitants of the country, who together are of course in an overwhelming majority. I am myself perfectly convinced that the cause of Zionism is one which carries with it much that is good for the whole world, and not only for the Jewish people, but that it will also bring with it prosperity and contentment and advancement to the Arab population of this country, and I shall do my best to help my friend Sir Herbert Samuel in carrying out the policy already declared by the British Government. But I must not conceal from you, indeed you probably know it yourselves, that there is a great deal of alarm felt by the Moslem population of Palestine lest they should be dispossessed of their lands and property and supplanted from their rights in this country in which they dwell, and put under the rule of those who are now in a minority, but who will be re-inforced by large numbers of strangers coming from over the seas. I have pointed out to them that Zionism can only succeed by a process which confers benefits upon the whole country, and which at each stage provides the means for supporting by industry or agriculture the new-comers who come in. They have also expressed alarm at the character of some of the immigrants whom they accuse of bringing Bolshevik doctrines. Whatever we may think of these fears, it is your labour to dispel them and do your very utmost to promote a spirit of peace and goodwill in the country. This I know is your wish and intention. I know it is the intention and policy of my Right hon. friend.I have just been making a statement to the Moslem deputation which I am afraid was not very agreeable to them. They will not expect me to make a statement to you which will be very agreeable to you. It is my duty to try to reassure and encourage both. We intend to do our best to secure a fair chance for the Zionist cause and movement, but we shall need all the help we can get, and not only help in the way of enthusiasm and energy, though that is very necessary, but also help in the still harder quality to display, especially in conjunction with enthusiasm, restraint and forbearance.When I go back to London, I have no doubt I shall be told that but for the Zionist movement there would be no need to keep up such a large British garrison, at. so great an expense, in this country. You must provide me with the means, and the Jewish community all over the world must provide me with the means of answer-ing all adverse criticism. I wish to be able to say that a great event is taking place here, a great event in the world&apos;s destiny. It is taking place without injury or injustice to anyone; it is transforming waste places into fertile; it is planting trees and developing agriculture in desert lands; it is making for an increase in wealth and of cultivation; it is making two blades of grass grow where one grew before, and the people of the country who are in a great majority, are deriving great benefit, sharing in the general improvement and advancement. There is co-operation and [6117] YIt must be accepted as a basic principle in considering the present and the future of the Jewish National Home, that the Jewish people throughout the world are inseparably connected with Palestine and its future. Among the practical measures of the Mandatory Power for hastening the development of the Jewish National Home we would suggest the adoption of a policy of close land settlement; the improvement of the sanitary conditions of the country; the introduction of an improved system of roads and other means of communication; and charging the Jewish people with the development of State lands and such other lands as are uncultivated and have no private owners and with the development of the natural resources of the country.The historic task of Great Britain in hastening and protecting the rebirth of the Jewish people in its ancient land would then be assured a great future, and the Jewish and Arab peoples will, under the guidance of Great Britain, faithfully collaborate in building up this country of a glorious past and of an ever-promising future.
fraternity between the religions and the races; the Jews who are being brought in from Europe and elsewhere are worthy representatives of Jewry and of the cause of Zionism, and the Zionists are taking every step to secure that that shall be so. The pioneers in a matter of this sort must be picked men, worthy in every way of the greatness of the ideal and of the cause for which they are striving, and in that way you will give me the means of answering effectively those who wish to prevent this experiment and cause from having its fair chance. It would be easier for me to speak in terms of ardent enthusiasm of the cause which you have at heart, but I should only be speaking to those who are already convinced. It is more important for me in these words which I address to you to counsel prudence and patience, and to endeavour to strike a note which will make your path more easy, while allaying the alarm, however unjustified., of others. I earnestly hope that your cause may be carried to success. I know how great the energy is and how serious are the difficulties at every stage and you have my warmest sympathy in the efforts you are making to overcome them. If I did not believe that you were animated by the very highest spirit of justice and idealism, and that your work would in fact confer blessings upon the whole country, I should not have the high hopes which I have that eventually your work will be accomplished.I think we have given it its best chance of accomplishment by the appointment which His Majesty has made of Sir Herbert Samuel. He is, I know, animated by strong principles of liberal and impartial justice and by an affection for all the people of the country over whom he has been set, and no-one can accuse him of not also being devoted to the cause which you have at heart. With his prudence, experience and guidance, I trust that the difficult years of beginning may be passed through and that in a few years&apos; time there will be a feeling of greater well-being among the people of Palestine, and that things wall be better for everyone and that the fears which are honestly entertained, mistaken if you will, by the Mohammedan inhabitants of the country will be proved to have been without any foundation.I thank you very much for coming to see me. I am much honoured by the trouble you have taken. I have read with great interest and sympathy the paper you have prepared, and I shall lay it before the British Cabinet on my return. They will see the case presented with so much force on both sides, and I shall do what T can to assist his Excellency in the task which the British Government has given him.Mr. CHTJRCHILL/S SPEECH AT THE HEBREW UNIVERSITY SITE.Chief Rabbis, Mr. Sokolov, Ladies and Gentlemen. I thank the honourable Rabbis for the precious gift you have presented to me, the scroll of the Law, which, as you have said, contains all the truth which has been accepted by the greater part of the enlightened world, and which is the heritage of Christians and Jews alike. I shall treasure this present in my family and hand it down to my children after me. I repeated yesterday the promise which Mr. Balfour.made in the name of His Majesty&apos;s Government. Great Britain always keeps her promises and honours the scraps of paper on which they are written. This time, too, we shall do all we can to fulfil our engagements.Personally, my heart is full of sympathy for Zionism. This sympathy has existed for a long time, since twelve years ago, when I was in contact with the Manchester Jews. I believe that the establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine will be a blessing to the whole world, a blessing to the Jewish race scattered all over the world, and a blessing to Great Britain. I firmly believe that it will be a blessing also to all the inhabitants of this country without distinction of race and religion. This last blessing depends greatly upon you. Our promise was a double one. On the one hand, we promised to give our help to Zionism, and on the other, we assured the non-Jewish inhabitants that they should not suffer in consequence. Every step you take should therefore be also for moral and material benefit of all Palestinians. If you do this, Palestine will be happy and prosperous, and peace and concord will always reign; it will turn into a paradise, and will become, as is written in the scriptures you have just presented to me, a land flowing with milk and honey, in which sufferers of all races and religions will find a rest from their sufferings. You Jews of Palestine have a very great responsibility; you are the representatives of the Jewish nation all over the world, and your conduct should provide an example for, and do honour to, Jews in all countries.The hope of your race for so many centuries will be gradually realised here, not only for your own good but for the good of all the world.
Once more I thank you for the present you have given me, and for the kind reception you have organised in my honour.I am now going to plant a tree, and I hope that in its shadow peace and prosperity may return once more to Palestine.Minute by Sir Herbert Samuel on the Memorandum Presented by the Executive Committee of the Haifa Congress, March 30, 1921.[It is not intended to make any observations on questions of opinion, but only on questions of fact.]I. Non-recognition of the Congress was not due to any question of its represents -tive character, but the fact that it opposes the principles embodied in the Mandate.2.. The Committee of the Jewish Conference has been officially recognised as dealing with purely Jewish affairs on condition that it accepts the principles of the Mandate and makes no representations inconsistent with them. This condition has been accepted. Should the Haifa Congress Committee take the same course as the Jewish Committee they will be similarly recognised.3. The separation of Palestine and Syria has no relation to Zionism. It is obviously due to the fact that Prance as well as Great Britain is interested in these countries.4. This is an illustration of the fundamental misunderstanding of the Arabs with respect to Zionism. There is no question of transforming Palestine in the sense that the present population are to be removed and another substituted.5. This passage is of interest as it indicated that the anti-Zionist movement is not part of any pan-Islamic movement based upon zeal for the defence of the Mohammedan religion.6. In Syria the effective authority is exercised by the French officers.7. There is no recollection of any such passages in Mr. Bentwich&apos;s book.8. The promise to King Hussein did not include Palestine.9. There is no question of touching anything belonging to private persons.10. There is no spiritual connection between the Arab race and Spain, or between the Turks and the Balkan States.II. The 400 years should be at least 1,400.12. This is an accusation that the British Government issued the Balfour Declaration in return for financial support.13. The documents mentioned in the book are known to be absolutely fictitious.14. The opposite is the case. The Arab villages in the neighbourhood of the Jewish colonies are not less but more prosperous; they have more employment; they show more progress in their methods of agriculture and live on excellent terms with the Jewish colonies.15. There is no basis whatever for this accusation.16. The inconveniences that arise from the creation of a frontier are not due to Zionism, but to the fact that the Mandates for Syria and Palestine are separate.17. The restrictions upon exports were adopted in Palestine, as in other countries, in order to prevent the country being depleted. They have been far less extensive than in Egypt, and similar to the restrictions adopted in Syria. At a recent meeting of the representatives of the Chambers of Commerce of Palestine, at which only a small minority were Jews, the Government was urged to maintain the restriction upon the export of wheat. Nevertheless, it has been considered safe to remove that restriction and all exports of cereals are now free.18. There have been remarkably few bankruptcies in Palestine compared with other countries.19. There is no basis for this accusation.20. These improvements have been effected at the urgent desire of the population and have been carried out without any increase of taxation., 21. The budget for education has been greatly increased, and new schools are being opened at the rate of more than one a week.22. The contracts are let by tender, and the cost to the Government is not increased by employment of Jewish labour.23. The present cost will be two millions and not seven.24. There is no intention of depriving the Palestinian nation, as a whole, of the value of the Crown lands.25. The press is more free in Palestine than in any neighbouring country; prosecution is rare, and there has been no case of an editor being imprisoned.&quot;     &quot;    &apos; Y 2
SECTION IV. ADEN AND SOMALILAND.Appendix 24.-Aden.NOTE ON THE FINANCIAL ASPECT OF THE TRANSFER FROM INDIA TO THE COLONIAL OFFICE OF THE CONTROL OF CERTAIN AREAS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.March 23, 1921.ON the 14th March the Secretary of State for the Colonies suggested to the Secretary of State for India that opportunity should be taken of the visit of his Excellency the Viceroy to Cairo for a discussion of certain questions connected with the Middle Eastern Department (copy of telegram is attached,and marked &quot; A &quot;). On the 15th March Mr. Montagu replied that his Excellency the Viceroy would be glad to discuss any subjects which Mr. Churchill might wish to lay before him. They could not, however, be finally settled except by the Government of India and the Secretary of State in Council. He agreed that it would help to save time if Earl Reading heard Mr. Churchill&apos;s suggestions for their solution on his way to India. In the meantime he was telegraphing to India Mr. Churchill&apos;s telegram and his reply, in order that he could get as quickly as possible the preliminaries upon which examination of the problems in London could be based.Before discussing in detail the points mentioned in the attached telegram: &quot; A,&quot; it may be as well to draw attention to a telegram received on the 21st March from the Government of India, of which copy is attached and marked &quot; B,&quot; in which they explain that, as far as they can see at present, they are likely to be able to accept the main recommendations of the Masterton Smith Committee Report in principle, subject to satisfactory financial adjustment. In particular, they say that any proposal to saddle India with financial liabilities for Aden on its severance from India must be strenuously resisted.The point of view of the Middle East Department is that it is impossible to consider Aden separately from the Middle East as a whole. With the disappearance of the Turks from South-West Arabia the British representative at Aden has been brought into direct relations with the neighbouring Arab rulers, the Imam of the Yemen and &apos;the Idrissi of Asir, who are in their turn in direct relations with Ibn Saoud and the King of the Hedjaz. The main object in creating a Middle East Department has been to establish one central authority for all the responsibilities of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the area inhabited by the Arabs. Without such a central authority no satisfactory policy can be pursued, and it is illogical to consider one part of this great problem separately from the remainder. It is for this reason that it has been proposed to bring Aden within the scope of the new Department.Indian interests in the Middle East fall under two main heads. Firstly, as a part of the British Empire India is vitally interested in the maintenance of the maritime routes which border the Arabian Peninsula; secondly, as a Power which possesses over 70,000,000 Moslem subjects India cannot but be closely interested in the policy pursued by His Majesty&apos;s Government towards the cradle of Islam. To such an extent are Indian interests implicated in the Arabian problem that there was practically no item of pre-war expenditure in the Arabian Peninsula which was not borne in the first place by the Government of India. It is true that in a large, number of cases this expenditure was shared either by the Foreign Office or the War Office, and it is not suggested that Imperial funds should cease to bear a share of the expenditure. On the other hand, the new arrangement is merely an administrative readjustment which aims at more efficient control of policy, and offers no ground for reducing the share of the cost which was in the past borne by Indian revenues. The entire charge will now fall in the first place on Imperial funds, but in the same way that Imperial funds formerly contributed a proportion of expenditure borne in the first place by India, it is now for India to contribute towards a charge which is borne in the first place on Imperial funds.So far as can be ascertained at the moment in Cairo the existing financial arrangement is as shown in the statement marked &quot; C.&quot;   If these figures are
&quot; A.&quot;Paraphrase of Telegram from Mr. Churchill to Secretary of State for India. (Private.)I should be obliged if you would kindly authorise the Viceroy to discuss the following matters with me when he passes through Cairo. My hope is that we shall be able to reach a provisional agreement which I can bring home for your concurrence:  1. Handing over of Aden Administration to Colonial Office by Government ofIndia.   How and when will this take place ? 2. Will the Arab Political Service absorb the members of the Bombay PoliticalDepartment now serving at Aden ? 3. On the assumption that India will pay the same proportion as heretoforetowards the cost of the Aden garrison and Administration, I suggestthat a sum should be fixed for the Indian contribution, which, in view ofcontemplated reductions, will in any case be less than what they now pay. 4. Will India agree to second for a period of five years officers of the indian army and Indian Civil Service required for the Middle East ? 5. I presume that India will continue to pay for the Administration of thePersian Gulf, since the Masterton-Smith Committee recommended thatthe Administration should remain under India. 6. Share to be borne by India in all Imperial expenses connected with thepilgrimage, including possible subsidy to King Hussein, and quarantineexpenses at Cameran. 7. It seems to me impossible that the Government of India should repudiatetheir long-established obligations in respect of other subsidies, many ofwhich arise out of treaty engagements made by them and all of whichare at present paid in the first place from Indian revenues. 8. Employment in Palestine, Aden and Mesopotamia of Indian troops as partof the permanent garrison.Please let me know by telegraph whether you agree that it would be useful for me to try and arrive at some provisional agreement with the Viceroy when he is in Cairo, or whether there are any of the subjects mentioned above which you would prefer me to discuss with you in London in the first instance.&quot; B.&quot;Paraphrase of Telegram from Governor of India to Secretary of State for India.  Repeated to Mr. Churchill.(Private.)The report of the Masterton Smith Committee has only just reached us. The Secretary of State for the Colonies may rest assured that we will do everything we can to help him, but some of the points raised by him, and in the report of the correct, Indian revenues appear to be at present responsible for the payment of a sum of 615,350/. per annum in respect of the areas which are now to be transferred from India to the Middle East Department. The Secretary of State for the Colonies sees a fair prospect of effecting reductions in the expenditure now borne by India, and it is hoped that the present financial burden will be appreciably lessened as a result of the transfer. * If, however, the Government of India maintain their present attitude as shown in telegram &quot; B,&quot; he will be compelled to refuse to accept the transfer, not only of Aden, but also of any existing Indian liability in the Middle East, or, in other words, to reconsider the whole position of the Middle Eastern Department. India would then be left without the prospect of easement which a centrally organised Arabian policy and a possible administrative amalgamation with Somaliland would offer.A separate note prepared by the Finance Department of the War Office on the past history of the incidence of military expenditure in Aden is attached and marked &quot;D.&quot;
committee, are too technical for immediate settlement. We suggest that he should telegraph his proposals, financial and other, both here and to you officially, in so far -as they affect India, We think that it would be convenient if your telegram to us could be made official and brought on to official records. As far as we can see at present, the main recommendations of the Masterfon Smith report are likely to be acceptable, subject to satisfactory financial adjustment, with which the report does not deal, but strenuous resistance must be offered to any proposal that India should be saddled with financial liabilities for Aden after its transfer to the Colonial Office.&quot; C.&quot;Incidence of Expenditure in Middle East.

Until the end of the 19th century India bore the whole cost, both civil and military, but on the recommendation of Lord Welby&apos;s Royal Commission on Indian expenditure it was agreed that, with effect from the 1st April, 1901, army votes should contribute annually 100,000/. (then estimated to represent one-half of the current military charges) and half the capital outlay (works and armaments) on the defence of Aden.During the war army votes paid the peace contribution (as above), together with half the extraordinary war charges. Similarly, Indian revenues bore the balance of the cost of the normal garrison, together with half the extraordinary war charges.In 1917, Aden being then practically besieged, it was decided to transfer the military control of Aden from India to the War Office for the period of the war, political control passing to the High Commissioner, Egypt, on behalf of the Foreign Office. The suggestion came from the Secretary of State for India on the military ground of unity of control under the then conditions; the Army Council concurred and the War Cabinet approved.Thereupon the Government of India endeavoured to disclaim all financial responsibility, but eventually agreed to leave the financial arrangements as they were, with the proviso that if War Office control continued after the war, or if the control of Aden Were ultimately taken out of the hands of India for good, the
Aden.Memorandum by Sir George Barstow.I saw Colonel Wood, the financial representative of the Bombay Government, on the 5th April in Cairo. We had a fairly long conversation about the suggested transfer of Aden to the Middle Eastern Department, and he handed me the attached papers.Sir George Lloyd is understood to favour the transfer of Aden from Bombay Presidency to the Middle Eastern Department provided there is a good prospect of stability in other words, that Aden is not taken away from Bombay only to be restored again in five years&apos; time. He appears to be under the impression that the impending constitutional changes in Egypt and the position of the mandated terri-tories may result in the Middle Eastern Department being left without territories to administer in a few years&apos; time, with the result that Aden would have to be re-transferred. I pointed out that, whatever might happen as regards Egypt and Mesopotamia, the Colonial Office would still be administering the African Protectorates. As far as I knew, the intention was to make a permanent transfer, though, of course, it was always open to Government to reopen a settlement if it appeared necessary.Colonel Wood&apos;s own view was that the transfer was sound as a matter of policy and that the transfer and union with Somaliland ought to be effected. He did not dissent from the view that India ought to contribute to the total cost of Aden, but he thought that there might be considerable opposition in the Legislative Council to any contribution being made and certainly to the amount of the contribution suggested (400,000/. a year).It is important to remember that whereas the Civil Administration of Aden is at present under the Bombay Presidency, the expenditure on the garrison falls on the (Central) Government of India.Aden was formerly run at a small loss to Bombay Presidency, but of late.years has been run at a profit. Table A (Civil Administration) shows that the average civil receipts for the last three financial years, apart from the Aden Port Trust and Railway and Municipality, have been 13-6 lakhs of rupees, and the average expendi-ture 9-5 lakhs of rupees. A considerable part of the revenue is raised by income tax, super tax and excess war profits, the average amount in the past three years having been 9 lakhs. This is interesting, as it shows that income tax is not an impossibility in an Oriental protectorate.Aden having before the wrar been a losing proposition for Bombay, money has been difficult to obtain for its development. Sir G. Lloyd is, however, more disposed to spend money on Aden than previous Governors. The increase in the non-official representation in Bombay is likely to have the same effect, for much the greater part of the trade of Aden is in the hands of Bombay merchants and traders.It is possible that Bombay Presidency may make a claim for the value*of capital assets transferred to the Middle Eastern Department, but the total book value of these buildings, &amp;c, is under 12 lakhs, and Colonel Wood did not seem to think that the claim would be seriously pressed by Bombay. I think he shared my view that it would be altogether wrong that the British taxpayer should pay for the value of cemeteries, jails, police barracks, &amp;c, on taking over the Civil Administration.Colonel Wood&apos;s view was that money could profitably be spent in the develop-ment of Aden as a port and trading centre. At present it competes both with French at Djibouti and the Italians at Massowah for the trade of Abyssinia, &amp;c. A union with Somaliland might assist British interests in this competition.He further recommended the change on the ground that the Civil Administra-,tion of Aden ought not to be under a Military Governor. The general officers who are successively appointed administrators of Aden have, he says, no experience of Civil Administration only one of them in his experience has been any good as a civil administrator and they are inevitably inclined to take the military rather than the civil view on any conflict of interest. He favoured the whole of Aden and Somaliland being under one Civil Governor who would be Commander-in-Chief with a commandant of troops under him.arrangements as to incidence of cost should be reviewed and possibly retrospective effect given to whatever decision was eventually arrived at. The Treasury concurred in the proposed review.  (Letter to Foreign Office, the 11th June, 1918.)
As regards superior staff, he thought four or five officers in all would be ample for Aden. He enquired as to terms of transfer, and said that men aged from 30 to 40 would not be able to cut their connection with India and come on a five-year contract, with a risk of finding themselves out of employment at the end of the period. Men who have served their term for pension, on the other hand, might be willing to come; he himself was in this position, and would be glacl to take employ-ment at Aden on a five-year contract. He struck me as an able and sensible man who would be a valuable officer at Aden where he has had some years&apos; experience. I believe Sir G. Archer knows him.He believed that with a reduction of paper references to India staff could be reduced or could do more work with the same number.Military A dministration.Colonel Wood was emphatic in his view that the Government of India would not be prepared to pay a contribution of 400,000/. a year for five years towards the cost of the garrison, &amp;c. Neither he nor I had any figures as to the actual cost and strength of the garrison, but he produced a Table C (attached) showing the actual drawings of cash at Aden for military purposes. This would not include supplies issued in kind, and so is not of much value; but he was confident that the cost to India is well under 60 lakhs of rupees (400,000/.).In any case, India would certainly argue that she could not be expected to pay on the basis of the war years. He thought the garrison had now been reduced to pre-war strength. He agreed that a fair charge to India for future years would be based on the equivalent of pre-war garrison at post-war prices. He further agreed that any saving by reason of amalgamation with Somaliland or new arrangements with Arabia should accrue for the British taxpayer&apos;s benefit if made by the Middle Eastern Department. But, as he was not authorised to negotiate on behalf of the Government of India (nor I for His Majesty&apos;s Government) these expressions of opinion do not amount to much.He also thought that the Military Department of the Government of India would claim repayment of the book value of capital assets transferred. This also, I think, can be successfully resisted on the argument that the transfer to the Middle Eastern Department is a transfer as a going concern of an undertaking in which both partners (Britain and India) continue to be interested.Conclusion.Generally, I conclude that the transfer is likely to be approved in principle but with a severe struggle as.to the quantum of India&apos;s contribution. India is far too much pressed for money to be likely to agree to any arrangement which makes an unduly favourable bargain for the British Exchequer, but it may be possible to carry the Viceroy and his Council to the point of accepting some reasonable compromise figure.There are not likely to be any serious difficulties with the Governor of Bombay, unless the Government of India decides to place a portion of the annual contribution as a direct charge to Bombay Presidency. Bombay would then find herself with an annual loss instead of an annual profit, and would protest accordingly.Appendix 25.-Aden and Somaliland: Military.Secretary of State,I submit the^proceedings of my Committee on the Organisation of the Aden and Somaliland Administrations, together with proposals for &quot;reduction in the present garrison. On account of the personal questions in view the Committee liave preferred not to make any definite recommendations as to the status of the Governor at Aden under the new organisation, i.e., as to whether, in view; of the fact that Aden is a fortress, he should be a senior military officer as heretofore, or whether he should be a civilian by reason of the &apos;greatly increased political and administrative work that will now fall to his lot. I have not had an opportunity of consulting the C.I.G.S. on the question, and cannot therefore commit him on this point, but my own view inclines to the solution of a Civil Governor, with a Colonel Commandant as O.C. troops, who will act for the Governor in the latter&apos;s absence.
16117]ZThe following is a summary of the Committee&apos;s recommendations: 1. The complete amalgamation of the Administrations of ..-den and Somaliland is recommended.2. No definite recommendation is submitted as to whether the Governor should be a military commander of Major-general&apos;s rank, as heretofore in Aden, or a purely civil officer. There would appear to be precedents for the adoption of either course. In the event, however, of it being decided to separate the civil and military functions and to appoint a Civil Governor, the 0.0. troops should not be of a higher rank than Colonel Commandant. The O.C. troops should administer the Govern-ment in the absence of the Governor.3. The reduction of the permanent military garrison at Aden should be carried out as follows: (a.) The present detachment at Nobat Dakim should be withdrawn in order to permit the infantry of the Aden garrison to be reduced at once to three battalions, exclusive of the Yemen battalion.(b.) Cancellation of the orders already issued for the despatch of a pack battery to Aden.N.B. Action has already been taken by the D.M.O. to carry out this recommendation.(c.) The immediate return to India of the squadron of Indian cavalry, but theretention of the Aden troop at its present strength. (d.) The placing in soap and oil of two out of the four 6-inch guns which formthe main armament of the Royal Garrison Artillery at Aden. (e) The reduction of the Defence Light Section to the minimum required for keeping the instruments in a serviceable condition. (/.) The reduction of the infantry garrison to one British and one Indianbattalion, after satisfactory terms have been made with the Imam. (g.) Proportionate reduction in ordnance, supply and transport and Indianmedical personnel.       , ,4. One flight of aeroplanes should be sent to Aden as soon as possible to take the place of the Indian battalion withdrawn, as in paragraph 3 (a), two aeroplanes to be available for use on either side of the Gulf of Aden as may be required.5. When the situation admits, the strength of the Yemen infantry battalion oi Arabs to be reduced to 400 rifles, and it should be transferred to Somaliland to take the place of the Somalis of the Camel Corps, who should be organised on a retaining fee reserve basis.6. Arrangements should be made to station one company of the Aden garrison at Shaikh in Somaliland for the benefit of their health.7. A station ship of about 1,500 tons, capable of carrying 600 troops, should always be available at Aden.8. The Chief of the Air Staff considers it advisable that the strength of the Air Force stationed at Aden should be one squadron. The Committee recommend that the question of the strength of the Aden garrison be further explored with a view to discussing whether it would be possible, by making further reductions in military strength, to bring the strength of the Air Force up to one full squadron in the event: (a.) Of peace with the Imam.(&amp;.) Of the failure of negotiations with the Imam.(Signed)       P. de B. RADCLIFFE,Major-General, D.M.O.Cairo, March 23, 1921.
FIRST MEETING OF COMMITTEE ON ADEN AND SOMALILAND.March 18, 1921. Present:Major-General Sir P. P. de B. Radcliffe, K.C.M.G., C.B., D.S.O., Director ofMilitary Operations, War Office.   (Chairman.) Sir Geoffrey Archer, K.C.M.G., Governor of Somaliland. Major-General T. E. Scott, C.B., C.I.E., D.S.O., Political Resident at Aden andGeneral Officer Commanding, Aden Field Force. Major C. C. J. Barrett, C.I.E., First Assistant Resident, Aden. Major H. W. Young, D.S.O., Colonial Office. Major R. R. JebB, Secretary to the Governor of Somaliland.The Chairman read a memorandum, dated the 12th March, 1921 (Annexure 1), which had been informally discussed by the Governor&apos;of Somaliland and the Resident at Aden. Sir Geoffrey Archer and Major-General Scott agreed in recommending that if amalgamation did take place it should be complete, and that the Headquarters of the new Government should be at Aden.The Committee then considered Colonial Office memorandum, dated the 21st February, 1921 (Annexure 2), wherein the arguments against amalgamation were fully stated.Sir Geoffrey Archer thought that the situation in Somaliland was not fully appreciated in the Colonial Office note, and gave the following reasons for thj amalgamation of the Aden and Somaliland Administrations : (a.) Somaliland was too lacking in resources and too small to stand by itself, and must be joined either to Aden or to the East African group.(b.) It had nothing in common with the East African group, of which the nearest port was ten days&apos; sailing distance away. East African methods of administration could not be applied to Somalis, who approximated in their character more nearly to Arabs than to Africans, and required political rather than direct administrative control.(c.) Except in the coast towns, Somali tribal law and not the Penal Code was in use, and it was impossible to enforce such East African measures as, for instance, the control of arms.(d.) Outside his own country the Somali&apos;s interests were confined to (1) Aden and (2) Mecca. Aden was already his metropolis and his trading centre, and Aden and Somaliland were commercially interdependent.The Committee, having considered the opinions expressed, did not agree with the views in the Colonial Office memorandum and were of opinion that the amalga-mation of the Administrations was desirable. The Committee saw no objection to the separation of the civil and military functions at Aden and the appointment of a civil functionary residing at Aden as Governor of the combined Aden-Somaliland Administration.Financial. Owing to insufficient information regarding Aden expenditure the Committee did not consider themselves competent to deal with the financial side of the proposed amalgamation.Military. The Committee were of opinion that any armed bodies classed as troops should be under the orders of the military commander, irrespective of whether they were serving in Somaliland or Aden.Sir Geoffrey Archer asked that half a battalion of Imperial troops might be stationed in Somaliland in support of the civil power. These troops would be of great assistance by their moral effect, though they would probably not be required to take military measures. &apos;A cantonment at Shaikh would have the advantage of providing a hot weather station for -the Aden garrison.With regard to the strength of the Aden garrison, the Chairman said that it was imperative that the infantry should be reduced to three battalions. He understood that the Air Force would be able to provide a flight of aeroplanes. He suggested the withdrawal of the present post from Nobat Dakim and the possible substitution of local levies supported by aeroplanes. Major-General Scott submitted a statement (Annexure 3) showing the present strength of the Aden Field Force and his recommendations for the future.   He pointed out the dangers of the present
Annexe re 1.memorandum to : Sir Geoffrey Archer, Major-General Scott.While the Political Officers from Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf are discussing the agenda which more particularly relate to their sphere, the Secretary of State would be glad if you and your staff officers would discuss the following questions: 1. The final separation of Aden from India will cut off the present source of supply of British Political Officers from the Bombay Presidency. Aden is not large enough to support a self-contained service. For purely political duties, officers of the Arab Political Service will be&apos; available, but some other source of supply must be looked to for the administrative staff. The solution may be found in the linking of Aden with the neighbouring Protectorate of Somaliland.The Arab Political Service referred to above will be a service which will supply Political Officers for Somaliland, the Persian Gulf littoral and Palestine, east of the Jordan. It is anticipated that from 30 to 50 will be employed in Mesopotamia, from 5 to 10 in the Persian Gulf, and 10 to 15 in Trans-Jordan.2. One alternative would be for the Administration of Somaliland to take the place of the Government of Bombay as the administrative authority for Aden. This would necessitate the separation of the civil and military functions which are at present combined in one individual at Aden, and the appointment of a civil functionary there directly responsible to the Governor of Somaliland for administra-tive questions. He should have a member of the Political Service on his personal staff, and would communicate direct with the Colonial Office on all political questions affecting the Aden hinterland and adjoining territory. His position would thus be analogous to that of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, if, as recommended by the Masterton Smith Committee, the latter is made responsible to one authority in respect of his administration, and to another in respect of his political functions.3. Another alternative would be for the Somaliland and Aden Administrations to be combined into one, the head of the Government residing normally at Aden with possible hot weather quarters in Somaliland.4. The garrison of Aden must remain an Imperial force, but there seems no reason why this should preclude the combination of the Aden and Somaliland commands under one General Officer Commanding.5. Possible hot weather station for the Aden garrison in Somaliland.6. Rough budget for Aden and Somaliland with estimate of grant-in-aid required from Imperial Revenues.7. Respective roles of military and air forces in Somaliland.[6117] Z 2political situation with the Imam potentially hostile, but provided aeroplanes were available agreed to the abolition of the Nobat Dakim post. Air Vice-Marshal Sir W. G. II. Salmond stated that a flight of aeroplanes could be available for the Aden-Somaliland station within three months, but that the Air Ministry held very strongly to the view that the flight should form the first portion of a complete squadron.Taking into consideration the Chairman&apos;s statement that it was imperative that the Aden garrison be reduced to three battalions, the Committee, while recognising the dangers of this course, recommended that, with a view to the reduction of the Aden garrison by one battalion, the troops should be withdrawn from Nobat Dakim, which was an extremely unhealthy outpost and crippled any battalion sent to hold it. A condition to this recommendation w7as that a flight of aeroplanes be sent to Aden as, early as possible. While the present political situation continued no further reduction of garrison should take place. When, however, suitable arrangements had been made with the Imam, and the future of Kameran was settled, the question could be reconsidered.
Annexure 2.Colonial Office Memorandum.The proposal that Aden and Somaliland should be amalgamated into one Govern-ment, which is to be discussed at the forthcoming Conference at Cairo, seems to call for careful examination.Somaliland has been administered by the Colonial Office on the lines of a tropical African Protectorate for the last sixteen years. From 1884 (when the Protectorate was established) until 1898, Somaliland was administered by the Resident at Aden as a dependency of the Government of India. It was transferred to the Foreign Office as a separate Government in 1898 on the ground that its interests were not identical with those of Aden and that its administration through Aden was inconvenient. ^ In 1905 it passed with the rest of the East African Protectorates from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office.It is for consideration whether the reasons which justified the establishment of the Somaliland Government as a separate one from that of Aden do not hold good at the present date, perhaps with even greater force.The history of the Protectorate during the last sixteen years has been fitful owing to the phenomenon of the Mullah and the changes of policy which his activities have occasioned, but from 1914, when a forward movement was sanctioned by His Majesty&apos;s Government, there has been continual progress and no looking back. In 1914 the Somaliland Government had a precarious hold of a few coast towns, and made no attempt to administer the interior which was in a state of indescribable confusion and slaughter, while dervish raids were carried out in Berbera itself. Since 1914, the dervishes were slowly but gradually driven back first from Burao (which became the Military Headquarters of the Protectorate), and then from the Ain Valley, and finally, as a result of the extremely successful joint military and aerial operations of February 1920, the dervish power was completely annihilated, the Mullah himself was driven across the frontier into Abyssinia, a solitary and. discredited fugitive, and the authority and administration of the local Government was extended over the whole of the Protectorate. Simultaneously with this process, which may be Called the military reconquest of the country, and subsequent to its completion, the organisation of the administration of the country has continuously been developed and extended. In 1914 the number of European officials in the Protectorate was about twenty-five, it now numbers over sixty. In 1914 there were practically no Public Works, Transport, Medical, Agricultural or Education Depart-ments: now such departments are either in full swing or in process of formation. In 1914 there was not a road, in Somaliland; during the last year or two motorable tracks have been constructed on which it is possible to travel by Ford cars and lorries up to the Abyssinian frontier. In 1914 there was little attempt to govern the native inhabitants of the Protectorate, and the efforts of the Government were confined to the military protection of the coast strip from Berbera to the French frontier; now almost the whole country is directly administered under District Officers and even the remote Warsangli area which is adjacent to the Italian frontier has its adminis-trative officer and adds to the revenue of the Protectorate as a result of the establish-ment of customs stations on this part of the coast.I have briefly summarised the history of the Protectorate during the last few years in order to make two things clear. In the first place, its recent history has been one of steady development and progress which has every prospect of continuance, and it cannot be said that the present system of administering it has been unsuccessful or that a change is necessary in the interests of good government. In the second place, it cannot be too clearly brought out that the Administration of Somaliland has throughout been formed and developed on exactly the same lines as the other East African Protectorates. Officers in Somaliland serve on precisely the same conditions, rates of pay, allowances, &amp;c, as officers in the service of Kenya, Uganda, Zanzibar, Tanganyika and Nyasaland. In some respects the East African service, including that of Somaliland, may be regarded as one; thus in recent times District Com-missioners in Somaliland have usually been. officers transferred from Kenya. The methods and system of administration are identical. Similarly the military arrange-ments in Somaliland correspond with those in the other East African Protectorates. The Somaliland Camel Corps is a local unit formed as a half-battalion of the King&apos;s African Rifles. The unit is, in fact, a part of the King&apos;s African Rifles, except in name, and it comes under the jurisdiction of the Inspector-
General, King&apos;s African Rifles, who visits Somaliland like the rest of the East African Protectorates. The European officers and non-commissioned officers of the corps also serve on King&apos;s African Rifles conditions, rates of pay, &amp;c. The results which have been achieved show that treatment of the country as a tropical African Protectorate is the right one.The proposal that the Governments of Aden and Somaliland should be amalgamated into one is presumably based on the assumptions that the administration of Somaliland forms part of the Middle East problem, and that where two dependencies are near one another (these are separated by a seventeen hours&apos; sea passage) they can be administered more efficiently, and perhaps more cheaply, by one Government than by two. It must be doubted whether these assumptions hold good in the present case. The question may be looked at from three points of view: political, military and financial.Political.The question of Somaliland is, obviously, one of African administration, and the administration of Somalis, who are scattered all over the &quot; Horn of Africa,&quot; is surely quite distinct from the Government of Aden and its Arab problems on the other side of the Gulf. British Somaliland is only a small part of &quot; Somaliland &quot; in the wider sense, and in fact, we administer a far larger tract of Somali country and a larger number of Somalis in Jubaland, the Northern Frontier District of Kenya, than we do in British Somaliland proper. British Somaliland and Jubaland are geographically and ethnologically one, and the administration of both should be on the same lines, as it is at present.Moreover the future of British Somaliland depends almost entirely on the future of Abyssinia, and this Abyssinian question is again essentially an African mainland question, in which the Soudan is, of course, closely concerned, out Aden hardly at all.Aden, as I understand it, is primarily an Imperial fortress, a defended port which is a vital point.in our line of communication to India, as commanding the southern entrance of the Red Sea. Its political problems are presumably only incidental to its geographical position and consist of its relations with the surround-ing Arab tribes. I believe it is proposed to discontinue these relations as far as possible, and to make more and more of a fortress of the place, but in any case, such problems as it has to deal with might be called political rather than administrative, and are matters of Arabian, not African policy. The Government of Aden and the Government of Somaliland have., in fact, entirely different spheres and few interest in common. Aden is essentially a piece of Asia and Somaliland essentially a piece of Africa, Aden is an Imperial fortress with incidental political relations with Arabia : Somaliland is an African Colonial Government which directly administers a large African area and a large African population and which is closely bound up with African mainland questions. To unite the two under one Government would be almost like joining Gibraltar and Gambia into one Administration.It is, of course, a fact that there is a considerable number of Somalis at A.den, and that these often come into conflict, individually. with the Government of Aden. But these are emigrants from across the Gulf and their presence at Aden is no more of a reason for uniting Aden and Somaliland than the presence of large numbers of Indians at Nairobi is for uniting the Governments of India and Kenya.Military.The military position in the two dependencies reflects the nature of the two Governments. The garrison of Aden must, it seems, always to some extent have an Imperial aspect and contain some regular troops, while the functions of the General Officer Commanding, Aden, whatever his status, must be that of an Imperial General Officer Commanding. In Somaliland, on the other hand, the garrison (i.e., the Camel Corps which is almost entirely raised locally) is required purely for police purposes, i.e., to maintain order in the Protectorate itself, and, as such, it is a Colonial force, suitable for its functions and entirely at the disposal of the local Protectorate authorities and paid for by the Protectorate. An Imperial garrison would probably be useless in Somaliland for the duties which the garrison has to perform. I foresee all kinds of administrative and other complications if, in the event of amalgamation, the General Officer Commanding, Aden, is placed in formal command of the local force in Somaliland as well as of the Aden garrison; and it would at all events be necessary to arrange for the senior officer in Somaliland itself to retain the power of disposing the Protectorate troops for all practical purposes.
Financial.Somalilancl is not self-supporting, and received a grant-in-aid &quot;yearly which is normally about 80,000Z. It is possible, however, that it may pay its way when its mineral deposits (chiefly oil) which are now being, or about to be, tested are developed.If Aden were self-supporting with a surplus revenue, there might be good reason to urge the amalgamation of the two Governments on the ground that the resulting saving to the British taxpayer would counterbalance other disadvantages of amalgamation. But this is not the case, as Aden also is in receipt of an Imperial grant-in-aid. It is suggested that if Somaliland were joined up with the Middle East area the money for its grant would be found more easily, as it would come out of the Middle East grant-in-aid. This is a question of tactics, but it may be said that we have not hitherto had much difficulty in getting the Treasury to agree to the annual grant-in-aid required for the Protectorate, which are, after all, compara-tively small. So far as actual saving is concerned, it is not clear how this would result from amalgamation.The only connection between Aden and Somaliland is really a trade connection. Aden is dependent upon Somaliland for its meat supply, and, as Aden is a port on the main trade route, it is the entrepot for traffic to and from Somaliland. This is a strong reason for welcoming the transfer of Aden to Colonial Office control. In the past the Government of Aden and the Government of India have .not gone out of their way to be helpful where the interests of Somaliland traffic were concerned, and, in any case, it will be a great advantage to have both places governed on the same system and to have both responsible to one authority in London. But it is not a reason for amalgamating both into one Government.I have briefly outlined the reasons which seem to me to make it necessary to approach with great caution this question of amalgamating Aden and Somaliland. If amalgamation takes place, it will be desirable that Somaliland itself should continue to be administered on very much the same lines as at present with a Commissioner at Berbera responsible to the Governor or High Commissioner at Aden who would thus be the connecting link between the two places. But in this event much would depend on the person of the Governor or High Commissioner, and it would seem very desirable, in the interests of the good government of Somaliland, which would be the predominant partner in so far as the need for administration is concerned, that he should always be a man with sound experience of tropical African administration. It is open to doubt whether such a man could always be found and whether,&quot;if found, he would be likely to be qualified for the Aden side of his task.February 21, 1921.r

SECOND MEETING OF COMMITTEE ON ADEN AND SOMALILAND.March 19, 1921. Present:Major-General Sir P. P. de B. Radcliffe, K.C.M.G., C.B., D.S.O., Director of&apos; Military Operations, War Office (Chairman). Sir Geoffrey Archer, K.C.M.G., Governor of Somaliland. Major-General T. E. Scott, C.B., C.I.E., D.S.O., Political Resident at Aden&apos; and General Officer Commanding, Aden Field Force. Major C. C. J. Barrett, C.I.E., First Assistant Resident, Aden. Major PL W. Young, D.S.O., Colonial Office. Major R. R. Jebb, Secretary to the Governor of Somaliland.Air Vice-Marshal Sir W. G  H. Salmond and Lieutenant-Colonel T. E. Lawrence were also present.Reduction of the Aden Garrison.The Committee considered General Scott&apos;s proposals for the immediate and prospective reduction of the Aden garrison and decided to recommend : (a.) The cancellation of the orders for the sailing of the Pack Battery now about to proceed to Aden as it is not required. N.B. A telegram making this recommendation has already been sent by the D.M.O. to the C.I.G.S.(b.) The withdrawal at once of the squadron of Indian cavalry but the retention of the Aden troop at its present strength.(c.) The main armament of the Royal Garrison Artillery stationed at Aden is four 6-in. guns. Two of these guns should be kept in use, the other two being put into soap and oil.(d.) The Defence Light Section should be reduced to the minimum required for keeping the instruments in a serviceable condition.(e.) The ultimate infantry garrison should consist of one British and one Indian battalion. It is impossible to reduce below this strength owing to the presence of a large native population in the town and the number of guards which the garrison has to furnish. N.B. The Committee accept General Scott&apos;s views that the presence of an Indian battalion at Aden is desirable for political reasons and that its substitution by an African battalion would have a disquieting effect on and would be strongly opposed by the powerful Indian community at Aden.(/.) Reductions of Ordnance, Supply and Transport, and Indian Medical personnel should be made proportionately to the reduction of the garrison.The Committee considered that when the above reductions of garrison had taken place Aden should no longer be a Major-GeneraPs command, but that the command should be held by an officer of rank not higher than Colonel-Commandant. His staff should consist of : 1 G.S.O.2.1 D.A.A. and Q.M.G. 1 Station Staff Officer.Sir Geoffrey xArcher recommended that on the reduction of the garrison the present Yemen infantry battalion of Arabs should not.be disbanded, but should be reduced to a strength of 400 rifles and employed in Somaliland in replacement of the Somalis of the Camel Corps. This would involve no extra expense to the State. He said that if this proposal were adopted it would no longer be necessary on political grounds to station British or Indian troops in Somaliland, although it might be desirable for reasons of health. *The Committee decided to recommend that on the reduction of the infantry strength of the Aden garrison to two battalions, 400 rifles of the Yemen infantry should be retained for service in Somaliland.The Committee pointed out the necessity for providing a station ship to keep touch between Aden and its outlying dependencies, which, in addition to Somaliland and certain Arab States, included Perim, Kameran and the lighthouses in the Red
Sea. The Government of India keep at present a Royal Indian Marine ship and a British India ship specially chartered for Aden service.It was suggested that a Government vessel of about 1,500 tons capable of carrying 600 troops should be stationed at Aden, or that a suitable vessel be hired from a private firm.Air Vice-Marshal Salmond pointed out that when the Chief of the Air Staff consented to the despatch of one flight of. aeroplanes for service in Aden and Somaliland he contemplated the ultimate increase of this flight to a full squadron. The C.A.S. was willing to give a flight as soon as possible to help the situation temporarily, but deprecated such small detachments as a permanency. Air Vice-Marshal Salmond accordingly asked if it would not be possible to devise some scheme whereby the strength of the Aden garrison might be decreased by another battalion, whose place could be taken by the squadron of the Royal Air Force, though peace had not been made with the Imam. Personally, lie thought that it might be possible in the future to employ aeroplanes for coast defence. Major-General Scott said that when a satisfactory treaty was made with the Iman it should be possible to dispense altogether with aircraft at Aden. Sir Geoffrey Archer added that not more than two aeroplanes were required for local purposes in Somaliland. Air Vice-Marshal Salmond replied that two aeroplanes did not form an administrative unit.In view of the opinion of the Chief of Air Staff, the Committee considered that, although they were not hopeful of a successful result, the position should be explored with a view to ascertaining whether it was possible to make further reduc-tions in the combined garrisons of Aden and Somaliland so as to permit of the increase of the strength of the Royal Air Force to one squadron.Appendix 26. The Imam.EXTRACT FROM MINUTES OF SECOND MEETING OF COMMITTEEON ADEN AND SOMALILAND.    &apos;(For remainder of minutes and composition of Committee see Appendix 25.)The , Committee considered a memorandum (Annexure 1) which had been prepared by Colonel Lawrence on the question of the relations between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Imam of the Yemen, and concurred in the recommendations made by him as to the tactics to be pursued. These recommendations had been arrived at after consultation with Major-General Scott, Major Barrett and Colonel Cornwallis.Two notes by Major Barrett, one on policy towards the Imam (Annexure 2) and the other on negotiations between the British Government and that ruler (Annexure 3), were also considered by the Committee.Annexure 1.Memorandum.Imam&apos;s Claims.1. Assurance of his independence and the guarantee to him of the whole of the Yemen and Hadramaut.2. Subsidy for himself and his tribesmen on pre-war scale.3. Expert armourers for making arms, ammunition and other equipment.4. No dealings with any of the people of Yemen except through him. An exception to be made in the case of Lahij, but the rest of Yemen to be under Imam&apos;s sway.5. Yemen merchants to be allowed to trade freely in British dominions.6. No non-Moslem traders to be allowed in Yemen except with Imam&apos;s permission, nor are they allowed to move from one place to another within the Yemen except with his consent previously obtained. He will be allowed to exclude Moslem traders also should he consider them objectionable.[6117] &quot; 2 A
7. No alcohol or intoxicating drugs and no lewd pastimes to be imported, and no munitions except for the Imam himself.8. Make good what the Turks owed him on account of arrears of stipend and repayment of loans.Present Position.The Imam holds the Yemen Highlands and the Tehama south of Hodaidah. He has encroached 25 miles within the Aden Protectorate in the Dhala district, and has made a slight encroachment on the Subaihi border of the Protectorate near Mufalis.A small British force at Nobat Dakim has hitherto kept the Imam from coming into the Hanshali and Alain country. Reports state that the Imam has no intention of attacking British troops. This would show that he does not desire an irreparable breach with us.Reasons for Making Peace.1. Remove threat against Aden and so reduce the garrison.2. Keep Imam&apos;s hands off the Idrisi, with whom we have treaties.3. Reduce the chance of French and Italian intrigue.Hindrances to Peace.1. Our treaties with the tribes in the Aden Protectorate. 2. Our treaties with the Idrisi and his successive advances with our co-operation or consent.3. Influence of ex-Turkish officers headed by the ex-Vali Mahmud Nadhim Pasha.What we can Offer the Imam.1. Customs facilities at Hodaidah and possibly an enclave. This will require the consent of the Idrisi.2. Guarantee of the port of Mokha. 3. Subsidy of 2,000/. p.m.4. Suzerainty over the Aden Hinterland, minus Lahij and the Fadhli territory, provided he respects the privileged position of our protected chiefs. Portion of subsidy might be considered as being in lieu of tithes in the Protectorate.5. Neutrality of Bin Saud.6. Confining the Idrisi within his present boundaries.7. Acceptance of terms re importation of liquor and munitions, provided this does not conflict with the Arms Traffic Convention of 1919 and&apos; movements of non-Moslems.N.B. In return for the above facilities we can ask that no territory be alienated to a foreign Power without our consent, and that concessions be first offered to British subjects.Tactics.1. Remove the ex-Turkish Vali, Mahmud Nadhim Pasha, through the good offices of the Amir Abdullah, if possible.2. Send a friendly reply to the Imam&apos;s latest letter (received in Aden at the end of February).3. Send one of the Lahij family with, some intelligent ex-Turkish subject to Sanaa, with a view to preparing the way for negotiations. On the success of this mission depends. *4. Despatch of a British officer to open negotiations.Annexure 2.Notcon Policy towards the Imam.The earliest treaty between the British and the Imam: of Lanah, shown in &quot; Aitchison&apos;s Treaties,&quot; is one between Captain Bruce and the &quot;Umur Futtuh-Oola, agent for the Imam Mehdi, the Chief of Senaa, the city of Som.&quot; in the year 1821.
By this treaty a British agent was to reside at Mokha, and was granted certain privileges, including the right of visiting Lanaa. By this treaty the British agent was accorded the right of adjudicating in disputes between British subjects, and rules were laid down for the&apos;settlement of disputes between British and Imamic. subjects. Although this is the earliest treaty shown by Aitchison, the English had first entered the Red Sea in 1603, and in 1770 there was an attack made on the British factory at Mocha, and Bruce&apos;s treaty was the result of an attack made on the British factory in 1819, which resulted in the bombardment of Mocha by Captain Bruce.In 1801 Sir Hume Popham had gone on an embassy to the Imam, but had not reached further than Taiz. The British treaties with the Imam were presumably rendered nugatory by the Turkish conquest of the Tehama in 1849, and of Sanaa in 1872. The Zaida Imam repeatedly rebelled against Turkish rule in 1911, a condominium was arrived at by which the Imam received a subsidy from the Turks and obtained religious and social control in certain Zaidi districts, with the right to appoint and remove judges and magistrates, subject to the veto of the Ottoman authority.  The condominium was to be for ten years.During the war the Imam maintained a benevolent neutrality towards the Turks. He refused to be drawn by the Sherif of Mecca into an active alliance and remained hostile to the Idrisi, though he kept his truce with the latter more or less faithfully. He sent emissaries into the N.E. Aden Hinterland to win over the tribes of the Beda and Autagi districts to his allegiance and to tamper with&apos; those of the Hadramaut. The Imam actually claims all districts that have ever been under the rule of his forefathers, including territory now in the possession of the Idrisi, the Aden Protectorate, Aden itself and the Hadramaut, but as a special concession to His Majesty&apos;s Government he has waived his claim to Aden and, as a concession to the Sultan, he does not claim Lahij.In 1918 a letter, dated the 1st October, from the Imam reached Aden. In this, though he continued to maintain his hostile attitude, he moderated his demands as regards his claims over the tribe in our Protectorate. No action was taken on this letter.The Naqib Abdul Mahib was, however, called and the whole situation arising from the armistice was explained to him. He was told the lines upon which his master should act, and was sent home on the 14th November, via Jizhr, with a letter to the Imam, forwarding the terms of the armistice and enjoining him, in accordance with Clause 16, to assist in the immediate evacuation of Turkish garrisons. He was informed that all questions of money and territory would be settled later.The Imam, however, obstructed the departure of the Turks on the ground that he had not been informed of the terms of the armistice, nor did he approve of them on &quot;account of his pecuniary and other obligations towards the Porte.He was told that, unless his attitude became more amenable, he could not expect assistance from us in the future. In the meantime Hodaidah was occupied to facilitate the evacuation of the Turks, and the Resident hoped that this landing would improve communications with the Imam and make him more open to reason. He reported that the Imam&apos;s communication, and his reported interviews with and letters to Arab Chiefs showed his intentions to be to extend his authority over the whole Yemen. However, the occupation of Hodaidah had a good effect, anil the Imam agreed to remove his ban on the departure of the Turks.The majority of the Turkish military forces accordingly came down to the coast at Hodaidah and,, surrendered. A proportion of military officers and the greater part of the civil officers, including Mahamed Nedhim, the Governor-General, remained behind. In January 1920 the Imam sent a mission to Aden, but owing to the members having approached the French and American Consuls behind the Residents back, it was sent back to Sanaa.The next move was from our part. A mission under Colonel Jacob was sent from Hodaidah with the object of discussing the terms of a treaty with the Imam. Owing, however, to the fears felt by the Qubra tribe that it was intended to hand over the whole Southern Tihama to the Imam, the mission was arrested at Bajil and was only released after an aeroplane demonstration over Bajil and the intervention of the Idrisi.The mission left Bajil in December 1919 and which was immediately afterwards entered by the Idrisi troops, and also concluded an alliance with the Qubra and Abaas tribes against the Imam. Since that time, individual fighting has continued between the Idrisi-Qubra confederation and the Imam. The release of the Jacob Mission offered the Idrisi a good opportunity, of which he promptly availed himself, [6117] 2 A 2
of advancing south from Zaidiya, where we had halted him at the time of the armisticeIn the meantime the Imam had advanced into our Protectorate and occupied Dhala in December 1919. The position has remained the same to the present day, except that we have evacuated Hodaiclah, which was promptly occupied by the Idrisi.In July 1919 the High Commissioner at Cairo informed us that he was anxious to restore the status quo in the Aden Protectorate. The evacuation of Dhala was accordingly made a condition of a new meeting with the Imam.If the Aden Protectorate were evacuated by him we offered to meet the Imam or his representative at Aden. The Imam was cordial in his invitations to Colonel Jacob or to any other officer to meet him, and suggested Kataha as a suitable meeting place, but gave no signs of withdrawing his troops from Dhala. Finally, the Imam was told that until his troops were withdrawn all communications between him and His Majesty&apos;s Government must cease. Notwithstanding this an Imamic deputation consisting of Hassan-al-Ubaidi and twenty-five men was sent down from Dhala with letters for the Resident (General Stewart). The deputation was sent back from Lahij in March 1920. Communication then ceased until February 1921 when we received a letter from the Imam protesting against our handing over Hodaidah to the Idrisi and saying that he had ordered his commander at Dhala to cease all forward movement in our Protectorate pending a discussion of the questions at issue.Unfortunately for the Imam&apos;s bona fides the first advance made by Imamic troops in our Protectorate since January 1920 took place at the end of January 1921. They occupied Wadi Thu, fighting between them and the Arab tribesmen is still continuing. In accordance with our Protection agreements we have supplied the Arabs with arms and ammunition, but have been unable to support them with the troops which they have continuously demanded.The present position is that the Imam has occupied, although he does not appear to have consolidated, the whole of the Turkish Yemen, except that portion in the possession of the Idrisi, and has advanced into the Aden Protectorate as far as the Wadi Thu, about 25 miles outside the border. He has sent his tax collectors into the Azraki and Alain tracts in our Protectorate, and Mokka is held by a repre-sentative of Ali Othman a local chief, on behalf of the Imam. Most of the Shafie tribes in Southern Yemen have submitted to Zaidi rule, but they are restive, and rebellions are frequent. At present, in addition to the fighting in our Protectorate, there is fairly severe fighting near Taiz, and the people of Ibn were recently in rebellion. There is also a party among the Zaidis which aims at dethroning the present Imam and replacing him by another member of the Sacred Family. It is negligible at present.The Hashid and Bakil, strong Zaidi tribes, are discontented with the Imam, and large numbers of them have taken service with the Idrisi. The Idrisi has taken possession of Hodaidah and for a year past has been carrying on indecisive fighting with the Imam at Jebal Nathan and in the neighbourhood of Bajil.The Idrisi covets Zahib and the Imam appears to be nervous about the position &apos; there, judging from the number of reports we receive at Aden about reinforcements sent from Taiz to Zahid.The Imam has another potential enemy in Bin Saud, who suddenly appeared as the ally of the Idrisi at the capture of Ehha from Hasson-ibn-Aidh in July 1920. Flis Wahahis subsequently advanced in Saada, in the north of the Imamic territory, but later withdrew, owing it appears to a defeat suffered in Nijoran. Turkish officers report that the Imam is not a friend of the Idrisi, but that he is afraid of Bin Saud.As a counterblast, presumably, to the Bin Saud Idrisi alliance, the King of the Hedjaz and the Imam have been corresponding with one another, but the result of this correspondence is as yet unknown.Our position vis-a-vis the Imam falls under two heads: 1. Relations between the Imam and the Idrisi (about this I have prepared a separate note).2. Position in the Aden Protectorate.   This is discussed in the following paragraphs.During the war the vast majority of our Protectorate chiefs flirted with the Turks, if theydid not actually assist them, as did the Amir and the Haudhali Sultan It was recognised, however, that they acted very largely under force majeure, as we
had made no attempt to protect them, and after the armistice they were all restored to our favour and given their pre-war privileges.The last chief to be restored to favour was the Amir of Dhala, to whom on the 7th November, 1919, the Resident wrote a letter in which were the words: &quot; The Government gives you a promise of safety while in Aden and promises you also that, if your explanation is satisfactory and you are accordingly restored to Government favour, you will be protected against aggression from beyond the border of the Aden Protectorate, both now and hereafter.&quot;Nami Nasir accordingly came into Aden and was restored to favour, but in the meantime the Imam occupied his capital, which the Zaidi have held ever since.The Amir was told in response to an appeal for help in ejecting the Zaidi, in a letter dated the 22nd November, 1919 (copy of which was sent to High Commissioner, Egypt, under No. C/978 of the 4th December, 1921), that &quot;We have no doubt that Imam will comply with out requests, but if he does not do so, we will recommend to the High Commissioner, Egypt, that British troops should be sent to Dhala to protect our proteges.&quot;A letter was written to the Imam asking him to vacate our Protectorate, but he did not comply. We accordingly gave Amir Nasir assistance in ammunition and money, and with the help of the Radfan tribes he recaptured Dhala, but lost it again next day.Arms were also given to the Yafai tribes in our Protectorate, who were anxious to repossess themselves of their land in Shaih out of which they had been turned in December 1919. Some of the Yafais asked us to organise their troops, but ewing to mutual jealousy among the sub-tribes nothing resulted, and no attack on the Zaidis was made by them until February of this year, when a very half-hearted attack on the Zaidis,,who were busy in Thu, was easily repulsed.About the time of the fighting early in 1921 the Imam wrote to Aden that he had ordered his commander at Dhala not to advance, an injunction he says he has now repeated in February 1921.The position now is that we have Protectorate treaties with a number of small tribes in the Aden hinterland. The Protectorate clause in our treaties usually runs as follows: &quot; In compliance with the wish of the aforesaid .... the British Govern-ment hereby undertake to extend to the territory of ... . the gracious favour and protection of His Majesty the King-Emperor.&quot;In the war with Turkey, however, we did not extend any protection to these tribes, and all, except the Ahdali Sultan, submitted to the Turks. The Mokalla Sultan also remained loyal, but his case is on a different footing.We are now faced with a similar situation. The Imam is coming down on these tribes. He is encroaching both at Dhala in the north and on the Subaihi border on the west and our military strength does not admit of the despatch of troops to the hills to fight the Imam&apos;s Zaidi a. The only assistance we can affgrd therefore is the issue of arms and ammunition. This we do in small quantities as.needed, for fear that any large consignment might fall into the hands of the Zaidis. This assistance is no real protection, and there is no doubt that, owing to their fatal lack of cohesion and tribal jealousy, our proteges will easily be beaten in detail in course of time. It is obviously our policy to stand by our proteges. The whole of our negotiations with the Imam during the war show this, and we have definitely given&apos; the Amir of Dhala a promise of protection against the Imam. We cannot therefore regard the Imam&apos;s advance and the consequent fighting as mere tribal affairs. The Imam is the successor of the Turks against whom we made the original treaties. A note written by Colonel Jacob in June 1918 gave the following reasons for not abandoning our proteges : 1. This would be a breach of faith.2. We should lose a foothold which one day, looking to the kaleidoscopic nature of Arab politics, might constitute a jumping-off ground in possible eventualities.3. We require a visible and tangible proof of our interests in the Yemen over and above the bare preferential pronouncement of Arabs for us over other European Powers.4. This would be tantamount to our loss of prestige as a Government.Colonel Jacob confessed in this note, what, is a fact, that our Arab proteges are of no intrinsic value, but just the reverse. Our treaties, with them are one-sided. We pay out to them thousands of rupees annually in stipends, presents and enter-
tainments &quot; a species of blackmail.&quot; The exact figure is over two hundred thousand rupees annually. &quot;Arabs come freely to Aden,&quot;but we cannot reciprocate within their tracts, and in the absence of a railway and a sanitarium we are getting little or no return for expenditure. (The only tangible return we receive is a certain amount of protection of the caravan routes.)&quot;If, however, we were to drive out the Turks (now substitute Imam) and if we were able to regain our old boundary by force of arms, we could then quite possibly afford to be magnanimous, and possibly release some of our northern pro-tected tracts in favour of the Zaidi ruler, if these preferred the rule of an Arab, though not otherwise.&quot;The words in italics in the above extract are important, for at present the tribesmen in our Protectorate are bitterly opposed to Zaidi rule. It is true that if the Imam canvassed our Protectorate tribes, as he will surely do if we do not interfere, and if he pursues a conciliatory policy and curbs the activities of his Zaidi troops, our Shafai tribesmen may in time willingly accept Zaidi rule, but that time may be distant, and we are faced with the present.Our Protectorate possesses certain potential advantages and very present disadvantages. What is to be the policy for the future \ There is at present &quot; no one man capable of ruling the Yemen with the full assent of all creeds. The strongest man is the Imam, who will in the ordinary course, provided he plays his cards pro-perly, gain the supremacy.&quot; We must have some treaty with the Imam if we are to have peace. The terms which Colonel Jacob was going to Sanaa to. discuss, duly modified to meet present circumstances, are the best.We must offer the Imam some quid pro quo if we desire him to waive his claims to the whole of the Yemen exclusive of Aden and Lahej, which is all that he will allow us at present.  The solution would appear to be to give him a subsidy.The Turks paid the Imam a monthly subsidy variously computed at 1,000/. per month for self and 1,500/. for his chiefs, 3,000/. per month for self and 2,000/. per month for chiefs, up to a sum recurring into hundreds of thousands of pounds. The correct figure is probably about 5,000/. The Turks, however, received the revenues of the Tihama and Senter Yemen which were considerable, while now we receive none of these revenues, most of which are appropriated by the Imam. Our victory in the war put the Imam, who has walked into the territory of -the Turks, into a very satisfactory position, and in any negotiations we might make use of this fact. Possibly, therefore, an offer of 2,000/. per month might be accepted. The alternative to this is an expedition to Dhala sufficiently strong to expel the Zaidis. Having occupied Dhala we must hold it, or the.Zaidi will return as we evacuate. The occupation of Dhala involves an addition to the Aden garrison, and a vulnerable line of communication.If the principle of the subsidy to the Imam be accepted it may be necessary to apply a little additional pressure before the Imam comes to terms. This may be applied by assisting the malcontents in Imamic territory, or by more active assistance to the Idrisi. Both these courses are objectionable as being contrary to our express desire to see the inhabitants of Arabia living at peace with one another. There remains the occupation temporarily of an Imamic port. The only port at present in his possession, and that only through a local deputy, is Mokka.&quot; The occupation of Mokka would probably have the desired effect of bringing the Imam to reason. We could explain the cause of our occupation and say that the remedy was in his own hands. He appears particularly sensitive about his harbours. The occupation of Hodaidah by us led to the removal of his ban on the -occupation of the Turks, while the occupation of Hodaidah by the Idrisi led to the breaking of his nine months&apos; silence, and a letter of protest to us.I have not discussed the question of the Hadramaut as it is far distant from the region of the Imamic encroachments, but it must not be forgotten that the Imam claims the Hadramaut also. We have to deal with an Arab potentate of inflated ideas as to his own sanctity, importance and strength. Although he himself is reputed as not particularly fanatical, he is surrounded by fanatics, with no know-ledge of the world, who are opposed to any intercourse with infidels. Our military efforts against the Turks in Yemen was not impressive. The surrender of the Turkish garrison increased our prestige, but our inactivity against Imamic aggression has reduced it again, and we are regarded .as a nation of merchants, always willing to pay others to do our fighting, be they Arabs, Indians or Africans, but having no martial qualities of our own.The Jacob mission, while captives at Bajil, realised this to the full, when thev*j
saw the surprise of the Arabs on perceiving that there was actually an Englishman in the aeroplane which flew over the village.The Imam must be possessed of the same ideas, and if so, he is not much impressed with our military strength, though he realises our wealth and superior equipment, and also our command of the sea.Annexure 3.Note on Negotiations between the British Government and the Imam.In July 1917 the Imam Yahiya-bin-Hamid-el-Din sent a special envoy named Naqib Abdul Wahid-bin-Admed-al-Kaulah to negotiate with the British Govern-ment with a view to his acting against the Turks in Yemen.The terms offered by the Imam were: I. His Majesty&apos;s Government must secure to the Imam throughout the Yementhe position and right enjoyed by his ancestors.2. That the Imam was to retain in his possession all Turks who might fall into his hands who wished to remain in the Yemen and any who might himself desire to retain, and that the British Government should bear the expense of the repatriation of Turks after the war.3. That the British Government should give the Imam adequate sums of money to cope with the operations, and also the allowances made to him and his chiefs by the Turks. These latter payments to begin immediately and to continue permanently.4. The British Government to repay the loans granted, by the Imam to the Turks.5. That the Imam should be supplied at once with men well versed in repairing arms, and in the manufacture of gunpowder and ammunition, &amp;c.6. Immediate supply of arms and quiekfiring guns, &amp;c.7. All seaports in the Yemen, which used to be under the control of his ancestors, to be handed over to the Imam.8. The Idrisi to be removed altogether from Asir.   .9&apos;. That the British Government was to have no communication with the people of the Yemen except through, or with the knowledge of, the Imam.10. The British Government should not admit anyone from the Yemen to British nationality except with the Imam&apos;s consent.II. Free trade should be permitted between the Yemen and the sea.12. Merchants wishing to visit Yemen ports for trade, must get the permission of the Imam. They must not go beyond port limits except with such permission, and then only to places where special permission has been given.13. The importation of intoxicating drugs and lewd pastimes should be prohibited.14. The British Government should afford protection by sea.The emissary explained that by the Yemen was meant the whole of the southern end of the Arabian Peninsula from Hali point up to and including Hadramaut. This included Aden, but the Imam did not wish us to give up Aden.Ports included all ports in the Red Sea and Southern Arabian coast, except Aden. Aden used to be property of the Imam, but he did not include it in his present claims.The Government of India and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs considered the Imam to be the one really powerful influence in Southern Arabia, that co-operation with him both now and hereafter was invaluable, and that his overtures were significant. They deprecated rebuffing him and thus closing the door to further negotiations.They suggested stating in reply that we welcomed these overtures of friendship on his part and would gladly come to an agreement with him, at the same time making it clear to him that we could not intervene in tribal affairs or abandon our staunch and loval friends.Our aim was the expulsion of Turks from Arabia, and if the Imam co-operated with us in this we would hereafter use our best endeavours to secure a satisfactory settlement between him and his neighbours.
At the same time that these overtures were made by the Imam a strong anti-Imamic confederacy was formed in the Yemen with a view to expelling the Turks. The Idrisi was allowed to negotiate with the Hashid and&apos;Bakil, powerful Zaidi tribes and adherents of the Imam, in order to win them over to his side. While a reply to the Imam was being drafted the High Commissioner, Egypt, telegraphed amplifications as follows : (a.) That the Imam might be guaranteed the subsidy he had received from the Turks, provided that his adherence to the Arab cause was openly given.(b.) That our agreement with Arab chiefs was to be emphasised, by which we undertook not to support one Arab faction against the other.(c.) That, inasmuch as the Arab movement had been joined by every influential chief in the Arabian Peninsula, his hesitation implied hostility to Arab independence, wdiich depended for success on the suppression of terri-torial disputes between Arabs until after the war, when friendly and fair arrangements could be carried out.A letter to this effect was despatched on the 24th October, 1917. The Resident had previously informed the Imam &quot;that we have staunch and loyal friends in the protectorate and in Asir, and I am to point out that under no circumstances could we for a moment consider abandoning them. We are prepared to give you at once the same subsidy which you formerly drew from the Turks, from the moment your adherence to the Arab cause against the Turks is openly given.&quot;The envoys submitted the following proposals on the 19th December, 1917, in accordance with which the Resident considered that an agreement with the Imam would be practicable. These were repetitions of terms 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, and 13 of July 1917, with the following additions : (a.) The Idrisi to maintain his present position, but to make no further movement.(b.) Other foreign Governments to be prevented from going to Yemen in future. (c.) No permission to be given to foreign merchants to visit Yemen without Imam&apos;s permission.The Abdali made the following remarks upon the Imam&apos;s terms: &quot;The immediate opening of a Yemen port will be detrimental to Abdali interests, especially if the Imam obtains possession of the Yemen lowlands as well as the highlands. All or the greater part of the Yemen trade will be diverted to the Imam&apos;s port. The Imam&apos;s stipend from the Turks was paid to him in consideration of his handing over the Tihama to them. I therefore argue that if the Imam gets the same stipend from the British Government the control of the Tihama should remain with the British Government. To give him both stipend and Tihama is uncalled for; further, the stipend granted by the Turks to the sheikhs were paid direct by the Turks.&quot;In sending the envoy&apos;s proposals to Cairo the Resident stated that there might be some chance of settlement if some definite proposals could be made as regards (a.) Fate of any Turkish prisoners captured.(b.) Payment of debts due by the Turks to the Imam and also of stipends to his subordinates. , (c.) The future of the Tihama. (d.) The future of the Idrisi.The Resident proposed that the question of Turkish prisoners should not be allowed to be a cause of further delay, and that some concentration camp easy of access (such as Hodaidah) may be suggested to the Imam. He considered that an increased stipend and the definite offer of a lump sum might overcome any difficulty that he might raise.As regards (c), he said that we could not go back on our former declaration, and that the sheikhs of Tihama should be left to settle their own debts after the war.With regard to the Idrisi, there was no objection to communicating the terms of the treaty with him to the Imam. The envoy knew that the idrisis advance into Tihama depended on the Imam&apos;s action or inaction. The position of the envoy was very difficult, because the Imam was bent on a treaty which would force the Idrisi out of Arabia, and we did not want to evict the Idrisi.  The Resident expected a reply
from the Imam, and requested that a policy should be formulated and, if possible, a definite basis arrived at for a treaty.On the 25th February, 1918, the Imam&apos;s envoy demanded that we should recog-nise the Idrisi as being entirely under the Imam.In March the Resident went to Egypt, and at a meeting with the High Com-missioner and other officers it was decided 1. To inform the Imam of the terms of our treaty with the Idrisi.2. To assure the Imam of his independence in the Yemen (this broadly), as we had already promised the Idrisi that we would assure his.3. The treaties that are already in force with different Sultans and sheikhs must be kept outside all discussion.4. To finance the Imam and his tribes on the pre-war Turkish scale, the tribes-men to be paid through the Imam and not directly by us.5. To furnish the Imam and the tribes with the necessary paraphernalia of war against the Turks.6. To allow him to dispose of Turkish prisoners of war as he likes.7. To lend him men to teach the manufacture of gunpowder.8. To open to trade a non-Idrisi port such as Ghuleifika or some other free from Turkish interference, as soon as the arrangement with the Imam is completed. The port to be free for Arabs generally and not especially for the Imam.His Excellency the High Commissioner decided that no mention should be made of the future of the Tihama should any particular port be promised to the Imam.He saw no reason why the Imam should not eventually obtain Hodaidah if he fulfilled the required conditions.It was further to be emphasised that we had every intention of upholding our treaty with the Idrisi, and would not countenance any action on the part of the Imam against the Idrisi. The terms of the proposed agreement were to be com-municated privately to Sayed Mustapha-al-Idrisi. The High Commissioner was also to write a letter to the Imam.In the Residents letter to the Imam on the above lines point 7 was omitted, but the envoy was verbally told that the Imam&apos;s men would be taught work in Aden.The Imam&apos;s reply to High Commissioner, the Resident and to bis own envoy came in June 1918.His terms were briefly as follows: 1. He agreed to our assurance of his independence, but wanted us to guaranteehim the whole of the Yemen. 2. He agreed as regards the necessary material of war for use against theTurks, and asked specially for guns, ammunition, cash and transportanimals.3. He accepted our decision regarding Turkish prisoners of war, but hintedthat we should help to pay for them. 4. He agreed to the subsidy for himself and the tribesmen on the pre-war scale. 5. He asked for the opening of Hodaidah or Mokka ports. 6. He asked for expert armourers for making arms, ammunition and other equipment.7. He asked that we should not deal with any of the Yemen people except through him, &quot; with the exception of Lahej and family, the rest of Yemen should be under Imam&apos;s sway.&quot;&quot; His relations with Lahej are to be in accordance with the engage-ment made between him and the late Sultan Admed Fadhl.&quot;N.B. This was an alliance, offensive and defensive, made some years ago.8. Yemen merchants to be allowed to trade safely in British dominions. .9. No alcohol to be imported and no munitions except for the Imam himself. 10. No non-Moslem traders to be allowed in the Yemen except with the Imam&apos;s permission.  He was to be allowed to exclude Moslem traders also if he considered them objectionable. .11. He further suggested our making good what the Turks owed him on account &apos; of arrears of stipends and repayment of loans made by him to them. [6117] 2 B
He defined &quot; the whole of Yemen &quot; as that &quot; which was once under the sway of our predecessors or that our hands shall acquire.&quot;Although the Imam&apos;s attitude was not thought friendly by Aden, Colonel Jacob and the High Commissioner thought otherwise.The High Commissioner gave the following as the advantages we should look to obtain from an alliance with the Imam : 1. To establish our prestige in -South-West Arabia and to clear up the unsatis-factory position in the Aden hinterland. 2. To counter a claim by the Turks, based on the principle of self-determination of peoples, to&apos;the continuance of their nominal dominion in the Yemen. 3. To facilitate an agreement, or modus vivendi, between our allies and theZaidi ruler of the Yemen, which would solidify the political situation inSouth-West Arabia. 4. To establish such relations with the Imam as would enable us to assist in theeconomic development of his country, and would give guarantees againstinterference by any other power in the political affairs of the Yemen.It was accordingly decided to write a temporising letter in the following strain, to send it with his envoy, and to ask the Imam to send a duly accredited person to conclude a treaty : 1. Repeat our undertakings with regard to war material.2. Proposal about Yemen merchants trading in British territory could notusefully be discussed until the Turks had been overthrown.   The sameapplied to the prohibition against alcohol, munitions, &amp;c, non-Moslemtraders, and dues from the Turks. 3. We could not accept the despatch of expert armourers to manufacture arms,&amp;c, but as they would be useless without plant their despatch might be postponed.4. (a.) We would reaffirm our willingness to assure the independence in Yemen of the Imam as constituted before the war, but without prejudice to existing treaties with the Idrisi (whose State we can recognise as inferior to his own), and our obligations to our stipendiary chiefs.(b.) Declare that we have no desire to interfere in the internal affairs of the country provided that we can be assured that the interests of our subjects will be safeguarded.(c.) That in return for our assistance he should undertake not to enter into treaty relations with, nor to alienate territory to, any foreign Power without our previous consent.(d.) That his continual aloofness from the cause of Arabian independence is increasingly prejudicial; that he should send an envoy with full powers to treat with us, and that an exact account of his immediate require-ments in money, arms and ammunition should be supplied.Appendix 27. ^Civil Staffs.THIRD MEETING OF COMMITTEE ON ADEN AND SOMALILAND.March 21, 1921.Present:Major-General Sir P. P. de B. Radcliffe, K.C.M.G., C.B., D.S.O., Director ofMilitary Operations, War Office (Chairman). Sir Geoffrey Archer, K.C.M.G., Governor of Somaliland. Major-General T. E. Scott, C.B., C.I.E., D.S.O., Political Resident at aden and General Officer Commanding, Aden Field Force. Major C. C. J. Barrett, C.I.E., First Assistant Resident, Aden. Major H. W. Young, D.S.O., Colonial Office. Major R. R. Jebb, Secretary to the Governor of Somaliland.The Committee considered the report (Annexure 1) of a Sub-Committee which had met to discuss the subject of the European Civil Staff necessary for the joint administration in the event of the combination of Aden and Somaliland.
The Committee accepted the view of the Sub-Committee that the Political and Civil Secretaries, the Political Officers in charge of districts of Somaliland and the officers in executive charge of the towns of Aden and Shaikh Othman should be regarded as members of the Middle East Political Service.It was agreed that a separate administrator, resident in Somaliland, was unnecessary at present, and that in the absence of the Governor the Military Commander at Aden should administer the Government.Major-General Scott submitted a memorandum (Annexure 2) urging that the appointment of Governor and Commander-in-chief of Aden and Somaliland should always be held by a military officer.Sir Geoffrey Archer, on being asked to state the civil view, replied that in Somaliland the military situation had entirely altered owing to the destruction of the power of the Mullah, and that the questions that would arise there were now wholly political and commercial as being connected with oil, a trade route to Abyssinia and the development of the country. As regards the Arab side, he said that 1. Political considerations in Aden had now increased vastly in importance owing to the elimination of Turkey and the consequent necessity of dealing direct with Arab chiefs, such as the Imam of Sanaa and the Idrisi.2. The towns of Aden and Shaikh Othman contained a large Arab, Somali and indian population with which a Civil rather than a Military governor would ordinarily be more competent to deal. 3. The amalgamation with Somaliland would add considerably to the purelycivil administrative problems. 4. The important harbour of Aden and the improvements therein, which wouldprobably be required in the near future, will require the supervision of atrained civil administrator. 5. It was true that Gibraltar and Malta possessed Military Governors, but, onthe other hand, the very important fortresses of Hong Kong and singapore had Civil Governors.The Chairman said that, although he could not commit the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, in his own view fortresses such as Aden were now of secondary military importance, and the general policy was to reduce their armaments. This policy had already been recommended by the Committee in the case of Aden itself. He saw that there were certain advantages in combining the military and civil functions in the person of some specially qualified military officer, but the future garrison of Aden would be so small that it was doubtful whether military officers of sufficient administrative experience would be stationed there.The Committee came to no final decision on General Scott&apos;s note.Annexure 1.Meeting of Sub-Committee to discuss the Combination of the Administrationsof Aden and Somaliland, March 21, 1921.Present:Major H. W. Young, D.S.O. (Chairmam). Major-General T. E. Scott, C.B., C.I.E., D.S.O. Sir Geoffrey Archer, K.C.M.G. Major Barrett, C.I.E. Major R. R. Jebb.The Committee pointed out that the Administrations of Aden and Somaliland ,were on entirely different lines, that of Aden being upon a system for which, so far as was known, there was no other precedent, and that of Somaliland being on the Colonial system. They agreed that it would be expensive and unworkable in practice if the dual system were to continue in the event of the two Administrations being merged into one.The Committee considered that the system at present in force in Aden, which was too highly centralised and had grown up upon no settled plan, should be[6117] 2 B 2
replaced by the Colonial system, so far as Aden itself was concerned, some extra provision being made for the purely political work arising out of the responsibility for the relations with the Protectorate tribes and control of policy in South-West Arabia.They recommended that the Governors of Aden and Somaliland should have a civil secretary dealing with all departmental matters in both countries, and a political secretary dealing with political questions in the Aden Protectorate and South-West Arabia and with political native affairs in Somaliland and neighbouring territories.The administrative system of Somaliland should remain as at present, except that headquarters should be situated at Aden instead of at Berbera. It was considered that the appointment of a separate administrator for Somaliland was unnecessary. It should be left to the Governor to recommend to the Colonial Office whether the Civil Secretary, Political Secretary or the O.C Troops should administer the Government in the absence of the Governor.If these proposals were approved the Committee assumed that the Colonial Office would work out the details of the scheme. They were of opinion that the Political Secretary and his assistant at Aden, and the Political Officer and two Assistant Political Officers in Aden, and the five District Commissioners and their five assistants in Somaliland should be regarded as members of the Middle East Political Service.There being at present no provision for Judicial Officers either in Aden or Somaliland they recommended that such provision should be made.Annexure ,2.Memorandum.With considerable diffidence I submit the following note regarding the question as to whether the Governor and Commander-in-chief of the new Aden-cum-Somaliland Colony should be a military officer or a civilian.To a very great extent the duties of the Resident at Aden correspond with those of a Governor of a colony, and his responsibilities exceed those of some Colonial Governors in respect of the important Southern Arabian political question he has to deal with, as they are connected with chiefs and tribes situated many miles outside the area of the Protectorate he administers.The duties and responsibilities of the Military Commander in normal time of peace are: 1. As Commander of a fortress which is regarded as of considerable importance on the highway to India and which protects a harbour and coaling-station, and2. As Commander of a small force which might be called on at any moment to carry out minor operations inland up to a radius of 30-40 miles or might have to undertake serious defensive measures pending the arrival of an effective force from India or elsewhere.I think I am correct in stating that the two offices of Resident and General Officer Commanding have been combined and held by a military officer, of the rank of brigadier or major-general, almost since Aden became a British possession.The decision to combine these two offices must have been arrived at originally for sound reasons.I know that the question of separating them has arisen in recent years, but I am unaware of the reason why the original decision was adhered to. The Govern -ment of India&apos;s reason for continuing the system must have been arrived at after very careful consideration by their civil and military advisers.With the union of Somaliland to Aden will come the additional civil and military responsibilities of that colony, and it has been conceded that the new colony will therefore require two high officials, i.e., (1) a &quot;Governor and Commander-in-chief&quot; and (2) a Military Commander of rank not higher than Colonel-Commandant.I do not feel qualified to discuss the duties and responsibilities which will come with Somaliland, but we are aware that they will come into the respective spheres
of the two officials mentioned and that the Military Commander must be subordinate to the Governor and Commander-in-chief.With reference to the two appointments, I think the following are worthy of consideration: 1. The first importance of Aden as a British possession is as a fortress, and, except as a fortress, this territory could not have remained in our hands all these years.2. The fortress occupies a most important position as regards the sea, andrequires protection from the sea and land. 3. The primary responsibility of the representative of the Crown in Aden isthe safety of this fortress which is a very isolated outpost of the Empire. 4. The appointments of Resident and G.O.C., Aden, have been combined formany years and held by a military officer. 5. There must have been some reason for originally combining these appoint-ments under one military officer. 6. The Government of India have found sound reasons for continuing thisarrangement..7. The safety of Somaliland must depend on the safety of Aden and military assistance from the garrison there. .In view of these points the question as to whether the Governor of the new colony should or should not be a military officer of rank not below that of major-general seems to be one for further consideration.There are undoubted advantages in having a civil officer as Governor whose experience enables him to handle the various administrative questions with ease. My own short experience has proved to me that these present no overwhelming difficulties with the efficient civil staff I have been fortunate enough to find in Aden, and I am strongly in favour of having as a Governor and Commander-in-chief an officer from whom the Government has full right to demand the additional knowledge and experience which will enable him to undertake the military responsibilities of his post.There are other points to be remembered in connection with this question : The place is unpopular and conditions of living are not at all on a par with those where senior civil and military officers generally find their peace headquarters.The appointment of Governor will presumably be well paid and will attract good men.The appointment of Colonel-Commandant will only carry the usual pay and will be unattractive from point of view of locality and professional opportunities. &amp;c.Friction has been known to occur between the holders of such appointments, and the climatic conditions of Aden, with its much-restricted area, would not oil the wheels. There would seem less chance of friction between a Governor and Commander-in-chief who is a military officer and his subordinate commander of the troops than between a civilian Governor and Commander-in-chief and his subordinate military commander, particularly when military questions are so frequently in prominence and military interests are so intimately connected with almost all measures in the station.In view of the small number of troops which may form the garrison after peace has been assured, it might be worth while considering whether the appointment of a Colonel-Commandant is required, if the Governor is a General Officer. The strength of the garrison will be less than that of a brigade, and it would seem possible to have an arrangement by which the senior officer present should exercise command under the orders of the Governor and Commander-in-chief, if he is a soldier.(Signed)        T.

SECTION V.-GENERAL.Appendix 28. Middle East Services.COMMITTEE TO DISCUSS THE QUESTION OF THE CIVIL SERVICE FOR COUNTRIES UNDER THE MIDDLE EAST DEPARTMENT.March 21, 1921. Present:Major H. W. Young, D.S.O. (Chairman).The Right Hon. Sir Herbert Samuel, G.B.E.Sir Percy Cox, G.C.I.E., K.C.S.I.Sir Geoffrey Archer, K.C.M.G.Major-General T. E. Scott, C.B., C.I.E., D.S.O.Colonel A. F. Trevor, C.S.I., C.I.E.Major E. D. Badcock, M.C. (Secretary).1. The Committee recommend that as a general rule all officials now employed in countries under the Middle East Department whose retention is desired, and who do not belong to pensionable services, should either (a) be included in the pensionable Colonial Service at such rates of pay as may be fixed by the Colonial Office and His Majesty&apos;s Treasury, individuals being graded in accordance with their seniority and responsibility, or (b) that they should be offered five years&apos; engage-ment on suitable terms. Class (b) would consist chiefly of officials employed in Mesopotamia and Trans-Jordania and senior men.2. The Committee recommend that in the case of class (a) the officials should be employed elsewhere in the Colonjal Service in the event of appointments lapsing, and that in the case of class (b) special provision should be made in the five years&apos; contract to cover the possibility of appointments lapsing within the five years.3. In the case of officers belonging to pensionable services the service concerned should be approached and asked whether it will agree to second the officers for a term of five years, pension rights being preserved subject to contributions being paid if necessary, and whether it will absorb them in the event of their appointment lapsing at the end of this period, or at some earlier date. The High Commissioner for Mesopotamia and Palestine should submit names of individuals with details of the services to which they belong.4. In individual cases where the service concerned refuses to agree, or the officer himself prefers to return to his own service rather than accept the terms offered, the High Commissioner should be authorised to attempt to retain his services, if desired, on a five years&apos; contract on special terms, and should refer the matter to the Colonial Office for the final approval of the terms recommended.5. Individuals of both classes should be informed as soon as possible of the action taken, and comments by them should be invited.6. The Committee agree in the recommendation of the Masterton Smith Committee that the recruitment for the Colonial Service for employment in Palestine should be conducted with a view to the special requirements of that country. It is also agreed that interchange between other areas of the Middle East is desirable by agreement between the British authorities concerned.7. In the case of an individual being transferred from a pensionable service under other Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government, or the Egyptian and Sudan Services, such individuals should be enabled to carry their pension rights which they have obtained under a.previous Department or Government to their new service. The Colonial Office should approach other Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, together with the Egyptian and Sudan Governments, with a view to affecting an understanding upon these lines.   Any engagements as made would be reciprocal.8. The Committee are of opinion that a clause should be added to the Mandates for Palestine and for Mesopotamia to the effect that in the event of the termination of the Mandates which have been vested in Great Britain, the rights of British
officials employed in the local Government under the British Mandate should be safeguarded.9. The Committee are of opinion that a special provision should be made for the grant of a higher rate of pension to a senior officer who enters the permanent service of the Middle East Department, and who is not in possession of previous pension rights.10. In the meantime, the Committee recommend that the status of all British officials now employed in the Middle East shall remain as at present for a period of three months from the 1st April, 1921.COMMITTEE TO DISCUSS THE QUESTIONS OE THE CIVIL SERVICE FOR COUNTRIES UNDER THE MIDDLE EAST DEPARTMENT.March 21, 1921.

The Chairman read the Report, which he considered to be most conclusive, and with which he was in agreement.Appendix 29. Subsidies.FIFTH MEETING OF THE POLITICAL COMMITTEE.March 16, 1921.Present:The Right Hon. Winston Spencer Churchill (Chairman). Sir Percy Cox, G.C.I.E., K.C.S.1. Major H. W. Young, D.S.O. Miss Gertrude Bell, C.B.E. Colonel T. E. Lawrence.Major-General T. E. Scott, C.B., C.I.E.,. D.S.O. Colonel A. F. Trevor, C.S.I., C.I.E. Colonel K. Cornwallis, C.B.E.The Committee proceeded to the discussion of subsidies and commitments in Arabia.After a short review of the situation, the Chairman said that they would first discuss the question of the subsidy to Ibn Saud. In this, as in all matters, he was anxious to effect economies, though he fully realised that it might pay in certain cases to grant subsidies, provided a corresponding relief was effected in expenditure on the maintenance of garrisons. Sir Percy Cox reminded the meeting that he had recently seen Ibn Saud, and had discussed the question of his affairs, both with him and with his advisers. Ibn Saud had very considerable commitments, and possessed considerable power to harm British interests. He had, however, always done his best to assist British policy, and Sir Percy Cox was confident that it was to our interest that we should maintain a policy of co-operation with him. He urged that in order to enable Ibn Saud to meet his financial difficulties his present subsidy, which amounted to 60,000/. per annum,, should be increased to 120,000/. per annum. He thought that it was not in conformity with British interests that Ibn Saud should be regarded as
ISOa sovereign potentate. The justification for paying him a subsidy lay not so much in the actual services to be expected from him, but rather in the amount of harm he would be able to cause were his policy to become hostile. Ibn Saud had done much to improve public security on the road between Hasa and Bahrein, and he had been most successful in settling the tribes under his jurisdiction. It was true that he had more than once acted in a manner which adversely affected British policy, but he thought that on the whole he had more than justified the good intentions which he professed towards us. He regarded him as equal to King Hussein, and -he strongly recommended that the proposal to increase his subsidy should be approved.Major Young pointed out that if we increased our subsidy to Ibn Saud,1 it would be necessary similarly to augment that of King Hussein. He realised that Ibn Saud considered himself equal, or even superior in status and in power, to the King of the Hedjaz, whose action in proclaiming himself King of Arab countries he bitterly resented. He submitted that if Ibn, Saud were to be given the title of King, it was possible that he might then claim membership of the League of Nations. This would tend to remove him from British control, which was undesirable in view of British interests in Arabia.Colonel Lawrence did not anticipate that Ibn Saud&apos;s inclusion in the League of Nations need cause His Majesty&apos;s Government any uneasiness, though he agreed that it might be preferable to maintain the status quo.In reply to a question by the Chairman, Colonel Cornwallis recommended that we should give Ibn Saud active financial support at present, and that it might be reduced as the country developed and as his difficulties became less. He preferred the title of Sultan to that of King.Replying to the Chairman, Colonel Trevor supported Sir Percy Cox&apos;s view that Ibn Saud and King Hussein should be treated on a principle of equality, and that it would be advantageous in increase the subsidy of the former.The Chairman was not convinced that it was necessary to treat King Hussein and Ibn Saud on the principle of equality. He pointed out that the former would be receiving very considerable assistance from us, owing to the policy adopted for Mesopotamia and Trans-Jordania, though he fully realised that too much stress should not be laid upon the fact that Feisal and Abdullah were the sons of the Sherif of Mecca, nor upon this artificial connection between the Hedjaz and the mandated territories. He agreed with Miss Bell that it would be well to give a douceur to Ibn Saud by way of compensation. He thought that it would be wise to pay Ibn Saud&apos;s subsidy by monthly instalments in arrear, as we should then be able to bring more pressure to bear upon him to maintain the necessary tranquillity in Nejd. So long as the method by which we dealt with these Arabian Chiefs was satisfactory, he did not attach much importance to the question of their titles. He did not agree with the suggestion of Major Young that it might be preferable to guarantee a loan to Ibn Saud, as he would thereby be given a large sum of money over which we should retain no control. The Government of India had definitely stated that India would accept no additional liabilities in Arabia, but he was not prepared to accept this.He thought it was improbable that rivalry could be prevented between King Hussein and Ibn Saud. On the other hand, if our policy were directed properly, it might be possible to effect a reconciliation between them, though, as Colonel Lawrence pointed out, Ibn Saud was five times as strong as King Hussein, and it was too much to hope that friendly relations would easily be established. He requested Sir Percy Cox, General Scott, Colonel Lawrence and Colonel Cornwallis to discuss the matter and prepare a report, giving the reasons for the proposed increase in subsidy to Ibn Saud, pointing out what he had done in the interests of British policy, and what harm he was considered capable of doing if he were to , run counter to our interests. The Chairman also desired that the report should embody recommendations for an agreement which would be of advantage to His Majesty&apos;s Government, and which would facilitate the maintenance of peace and order in Nejd and the surrounding territories. He suggested that possibly the subsidy might be increased to 100,000/. provided that an adequate quid pro quo could be expected. Among other matters to which Ibn Saud must agree in return for the subsidy would be the cessation of his campaign against King Hussein and maintenance or peace with the Shammar, as his attacks on the Latter had already had
the elect of making the Aneza move northwards, and disturbing the political equilibrium of the area through which the proposed air and motor route from Palestine to Iraq would pass. Ibn Saud must also refrain from attacking Koweit. Miss Bell thought that it would be unnecessary to give Ibn Rashid a subsidy if we could guarantee him immunity from attack by Ibn Saud and give him some small sum in consideration of his maintaining public security along the air and motor route.In reply to Major Young, Sir Percy Cox stated that Ibn Saud might perhaps accept a wireless apparatus as a present if we cared to offer it to him. He pointed out that it would then be necessary for us to have an agent at Riadh. Ibn Saud could not agree to an Englishman being there, though he had already asked that a Moslem doctor should be sent.   Possibly something could be arranged on these lines.Sir Percy Cox suggested that the Colonial Office should deal with Ibn Saud through himself and not through the British Representative at Bahrein direct.Major Young submitted that though this was clearly right so long as Sir Percy Cox was High Commissioner, it would be undesirable that the channel of communi-cation should pass through future High Commissioners of Iraq. The Chairman agreed that Sir Percy Cox should certainly deal personally with Ibn Saud so long as he was High Commissioner, but that the channel of communication ought not in future to pass through the High Commissioner of Mesopotamia.Colonel Lawrence pointed out that up to now we had encouraged Ibn Saud to attack the Shammar, in order to divert his attention from King Hussein. . He emphasised that we should need the friendship of the Shammar if the projected route passed through Jauf, which was now in the hands of Ibn Rashid. Colonel Lawrence briefly reviewed the position in regard to King Hussein, whose income was greatly reduced by his payments in charity to the people of Mecca and the surrounding tribes, owing to the failure of the pilgrimage. Last year these amounted to 180,000/. The Turks had spent approximately 400,000/. per annum in the Hedjaz, but this sum was mostly utilised for military purposes, and in return they had taken the customs receipts at Jeddah. This source of revenue had now passed into the hands of the King. It was of the utmost importance, both to King Hussein and to British interests, that the prosperity of the pilgrimage should be restored as soon as possible by the establishment of public security in the Hedjaz.Major Young reminded the meeting that India has never paid anything towards this subsidy, in spite of her interest in the pilgrimage. The scandals connected with the pilgrimage were well known, and no improvement could be expected until financial assistance was again given to King Hussein, who had not been paid any subsidy by the British Government since February 1920. When the prosperity of the pilgrimage had been established it might be possible to reduce the subsidy, or even to stop it altogether.Miss Bell thought that it was essential that one of the conditions of the subsidy should be that better control should be enforced. Colonel Lawrence pointed out that until money was forthcoming, it was improbable that King Hussein would listen to our advice. Colonel Cornwallis thought that it was essential that certain improve-ments should be insisted upon in Mecca and on the pilgrimage route, notably in the case of the water supply in the Holy Cities. He suggested the dispatch of a Moslem engineer for this purpose. Colonel Lawrence emphasised the urgent necessity of reopening the Hedjaz Railway for pilgrim traffic.The Chairman requested that the Sub-Committee appointed to consider the case of Ibn Saud should similarly report upon the conditions of the subsidy to King Hussein. He suggested that these should include undertakings by the King to encourage this pilgrimage; to maintain an attitude of goodwill towards the British Government; to refrain from any Sherifian propaganda which ran counter to British interests; to abstain from and entirely disassociate himself from anti-French propaganda; and to restrain the activities of the Emir Abdullah in Trans-Jordania. He should be informed that it was out of the question for him to expect to obtain Damascus by force, and that he must adopt a conciliatory attitude towards Ibn Saud.&apos; The Chairman stated that it would be to our advantage to subsidise the Imam, with whom we had so far been unable to establish relations. He pointed out that he was by far the most powerful and the richest Chief in the Yemen, and that one of the conditions of the grant, which should be paid monthly and might amount^ to 24,000/. per annum, should be that he should refrain from attacking the Idrisi. [6117] 2 C
This would lead to the establishment of peaceful conditions round Aden, and allow of a reduction of the garrison there. He considered that we should resume payment of an allowance to the Idrisi, who during the war had done good service. This might amount to 12,000/. per annum.Colonel Lawrence considered that if it was possible to subsidise only one of these two rulers, the one to be helped should be the Imam. The Chairman pointed out that it would be worth our while to make payments to both if a saving could be shown on the Aden garrison, and he directed that the same Sub-Committee should submit recommendations as to amounts and conditions of grants to the Imam and Idrisi.SIXTH MEETING OF THE POLITICAL COMMITTEE.March 18, 1921.Present:The Right Hon. Winston Spencer Churchill, M.P. (Chairman).Sir Percy Cox, G.C.I.E., K.C.S.I.Major-General T. E. Scott, C.B., C.I.E., D.S.O.Colonel A. F. Trevor, C.S.I., C.I.E.Colonel T. E. Lawrence.Colonel Cornwallis, C.B.E.Colonel Slater.Major Young, D.S.O.Miss Gertrude Bell, C.B.E.Major E. D. Badcock, M.C. (Secretary).Colonel-Lawrence read the report (Annexure) of the Sub-Committee on Subsidies which had been appointed at the last meeting. &apos;Major Young raised the point whether, from the international aspect, the League of Nations might not object to our treatment of King Hussein, who under the League was an independent Sovereign with membership of the League, as a: subsidy-dised chief. He thought it was possible that the French and Italian Governments might raise some objection, and claim the right to participate. This might entail a reduction of the British subsidy to King Hussein, which would make it easier for us to reduce the grant to Ibn Saud.Colonel Lawrence did not attach much weight to this argument. He emphasised that it was essential that we should subsidise Ibn Saud sufficiently, as he possessed very great power to do us harm.Sir Percy Coon was in agreement with Colonel Lawrence, and the Chairman concurred.Colonel Trevor stated that the Indian Government had decided to discontinue the payments to the Sheikh of Koweit, which had been initiated in the first instance to counteract German competition for the use of the port of Basra. In considera tion of these payments we had obtained certain rights in respect of the Koweit foreshore. German competition was no longer to be feared, and if any further payment were made in future it should be a charge upon Mesopotamia.Sir Percy Cox pointed out that the old sheikh from whom the lease had been obtained had recently died, and that the appointment of his successor might be a suitable occasion to discontinue the payment.
Meeting of Sub-Committee on the Question of Subsidies.Present.:Sir P. Cox, G.C.I.E., K.C.S.I. General Scott, C.B., C.I.E., D.S.O. Colonel Cornwallis. Colonel Lawrence.&apos;A genda.To consider the question of subsidies to Arab chiefs in Arabia, and to report (a.) The total amount of the subsidies recommended. (b.) Their distribution.(c.) The services to be rendered in return for them.We recommend that a total amount of 248,000/. a year be paid in subsidies. The present total is 96,000/. a year, of which 36,000/. are now paid by the. Indian and Mesopotamian Governments.The subsidies fall into two classes: (1.) Obligatory, in fulfilment of treaty.(2.) Voluntary, to obtain certain political results.1. The obligatory class (exclusive of Muscat, 186,400 rupees per annum, paid by the Government of India) is a small one.   It comprises (a.) Shehr and Makalla : 720 rupees per annum.(b.) Aden protectorate chiefs: 200,000 rupees per annum.Most of these, including the largest ones, are guaranteed by treaty, and cannot be reduced while the present Aden protectorate arrangements remain in force. 2. The only voluntary subsidies now being paid are (a.) Bin Saud: 5,000/. a month.(&amp;.) Fahad Bey :.20,000 rupees a month.We recommend (a.) That Bin Saud be paid 100,000/. per annum. (b.) That Fahad Bey be paid 240,000 rupees per annum. (c.) That King Hussein be paid 100,000/. per annum. (d.) That the Idrisi be paid 12,000/. per annum.The reasons for the four voluntary political subsidies are as follows :-(a.) Bin Saud. Bin Saud is the greatest factor in Arabian politics. He owes this position entirely to his skill and personality. He has a treaty wdth His Majesty&apos;s Government. His relations with us have been uniformly friendly. His capacity to harm us is great. From his central position he can invade South-West Mesopotamia, Koweit, Hedjaz and Jebel Shammar when he pleased. The Akhwan, a militant sect of his subjects, are always urging him to attack those of his neigh -bours who belong to the ordinary Moslem sects. Four such expeditions have taken place in the last four months; but it is significant that none of them was pushed home, and we believe that it is Bin Saud himself who is the moderating influence, and that he remains,at the head of the Akhwan movement, in a position to restrain their excesses, mainly by skilful use of our subsidy, which is probably now as large as the total revenues of his Government from other sources.British interests require from Bin Saud that he refrain-(i.) From armed action against Mesopotamia, (ii.) From armed action against Koweit, (iii.) From armed action against the Hedjaz,and in the near future, in the event of our coming to an understanding with Ibn Rashid, we will probably desire that each party should undertake not to attack the other without endeavouring to settle their differences by our mediation or advice. [6117] &quot; 1 2 C 2Annexure.
These objects are at present not perfectly attained, and it is therefore suggested that Bin SauoVs subsidy be increased from 60,000/. a year to 100,000/. a year, in the hope that he will gain greater ascendancy over his followers, and be enabled to fulfil our wishes more exactly. It is suggested that the increase take effect at once, for the reduction of our garrison in Mesopotamia will encourage disorderly elements, and the selection of Feisal as ruler will not please Bin Saud. To increase his subsidy during the uncomfortable period appears prudent.The increase need not be considered permanent. It should be possible Lo insti-tute friendly relations between Bin Saud and Feisal, and also between Bin Saud and King Hussein. Feisafs accession to Irak should consolidate its peoples, and if at the same time a popular Government can be established in Trans-Jordan the stabilis-ing effect on the desert between should be great, especially if an air route across it is in constant operation. We would then be in close contact with the Sham mar and Anazeh, and perhaps able to hold them in accord. In this case the temptation before the Akhwan to attack them, or Koweit, or Hedjaz would be much reduced, and the subsidy could come down in proportion.We recommend, therefore, that a subsidy of 100,000/. a year be paid monthly in arrears to Bin Saud on the above conditions, and that a British representative be sent to him to explain to him the new conditions, and impress on him that on their fulfilment depends the payment of each monthly instalment.It is understood that Bin Saud wishes to assume the title of Sultan of Nejd. We recommend that in this case His Majesty&apos;s Government should recognise it, and that Sir Percy Cox be authorised to let him know this through his deputation now at Baghdad. As soon as Bin Saud has made a formal notification to us, we should notify King Hussein that we have accepted the new style.(b.) Fahad Bey. Fahad Bey is chief of the Ammarat Anazeh, on the Mesopo-mesopotamian border west of Baghdad and Korbela, west of the Euphrates. He receives a. payment of 240,000 rupees per annum from the Mesopotamian Government, in return for certain services. We recommend that it be continued, since the projected air route from Palestine crosses his tribal territory for the last 200 miles of its course, and his assistance will be necessary to its safe working.(c.) King Hussein. King Hussein, though militarily less powerful than Bin Saud, concerns us as guardian of the Holy Places, and because of his attitude towards the decision of the Allies as regards Arab areas. Unless he accepts these decisions in their newly-modified form he will.be a cause of unrest in the mandated territories, and a nuisance in the Hedjaz. The Moslem world believes we created him, and will blame us if with the disappearance of the Turks from Arabia the pilgrimage condi-tions become worse. This has been the case lately, since the war has interrupted the pilgrim traffic, and consequently cut down the revenues of the Hedjaz. Hussein has not enough receipts to-day to afford to run a good pilgrimage, nor will he have until larger numbers of overseas pilgrims begin to arrive. Unfortunately they are being deterred by adverse reports of conditions in Mecca. To break the vicious circle we recommend that enough subsidy be paid to King Hussein to enable him to put his house in order; and on grounds of principle we recommend that he be paid the same rate as Bin Saud, namely, 100,000/. a year. To pay one more than the other causes jealousy and unfavourable comment.British interests demand from King Hussein that he (i.) Ratifies the Treaty of Versailles and signs and ratifies the Turkish Treaty. This includes acceptance of the mandatory principle, and the disposal of the Arab countries.(ii.) Recognises and respects our treaties with Bin Saud and the Idrisi, and refrains from all aggression against them.(iii.) Improves the condition of the pilgrimage. This will include public security, sanitation and protection of the rights of pilgrims. It involves improvements of water supply and hospitals, and a reorganisation of the quarantine at Jidda.(iv.) Recognise the rights and interests of British subjects in the Hedjaz. In place of the Capitulations it will be necessary to devise some new safe-guard for British subjects there.(v.) Accepts a British consul and agent at Jidda, and, if necessary, a British Moslem agent in Mecca.(vi.) Prevents the Holy Places from becoming a focus for anti-British or pan-Islamic intrigue/
Appendix 30. Cross-Desert Route, Railway, and Pipe-Line.EXTRACT FROM MINUTES OF FOURTH MEETING OF THE COMBINED POLITICAL AND MILITARY COMMITTEE.March 16, 1921.(For remainder of minutes and composition of Committee see Appendix 8.)The Chairman stated that it would be necessary to carry out a far-sighted policy of Imperial aerial development in the future. One of the main air routes would undoubtedly be that connecting Egypt with Mesopotamia and India, which would shorten the distance to Australia and New Zealand by eight or ten days. In order to execute this policy it was essential that tranquillity should be maintained upon the route, and it was proposed that a motor-track should be made across the desert from Palestine to Irak, along which aerodromes and wireless stations would be placed at various points. It was suggested that the security of this route might be maintained by granting subsidies to the tribes, and every endeavour must be made to improve its commercial and military value.   There appeared no reason why the(yii.) Prevents the Sherifian movement from taking anti-French action, and in particular restrains his followers and tribes in the Syrian area from all manifestation against ourselves or our allies.We anticipate that the institution of representative Governments in Mesopo-tamia and Trans-Jordan will satisfy the expectation of King Hussein and persuade him to accept our advice as in the past, especially if we can establish settled condi-tions on his eastern frontier and accord him with Bin Saud. The grant of a subsidy of 100,000/. a year paid monthly in arrears on the above conditions should stimulate him to expend capital on improving the amenities of Mecca. When the pilgrimage is restored, and the Hedjaz again solvent the amount might be reduced, or the entire subsidy withdrawn.(d.) The Idrisi. The Idrisi was the first Arab ruler to join us in the war. Our treaty with him of January 1917 binds us to help him with the sinews of war such as arms and ammunition both during the war and afterwards, and if he is expelled to provide him an asylum, and to use every endeavour to restore him to his former condition without any diminutions therein. In return we acquire certain definite rights, and have been able to exclude foreign Powers from exercising influence in his sphere. His territory is a strip along the coast, and contains salt, and perhaps oil. Strategically it has been of use to us, as a means of bringing pressure to bear on the territory of the Imarn of Sanaa, inland. He is in treaty relations with Bin Saud. At the same time the Idrisi&apos;s friendship is in some respects inconvenient, lie is the inevitable enemy of the Imam of Sanaa, an old-established, rich and powerful prince of Yemen, who was formerly a Turkish subject, but who is now independent and with whom we would wish to have friendly relations, since he neighbours our protectorate, and indeed is at this moment in armed occupation of part of it,3. The Imam. Our arguments to persuade the Imam to listen to us are a satisfactory settlement of our frontier line and perhaps a subsidy of 2,000/. a month, though the moment for this has not yet arrived and his wealth makes him less quick to this form of influence than Bin Saud. The strongest factor in our hands to promise him is the holding back of the Tdrisi from further advances into his areas and for this purpose we want to keep the Idrisi in being on his flank. The Idrisi is at present in difficulties, and to enable him to do this he will require a subsidy of perhaps 1,00Q/. a month, and we recommend that it be paid to him on condition that he maintains friendly relations with us, and grants no concessions to foreign parties in his territory. It is left for consideration whether he should also be given a gift of 5,000/. to pay his more pressing debts.4. Koweit.-^The Sheikh of Koweit, which is a neighbour of the Mesopotamian State and a trade centre of importance, at present receives a rent of 60,000 rupees a year for a strip of his foreshore. This is no longer required by the Government of India, who recommend that the lease be terminated.
civil aerial service should not utilise the same aerodromes, sheds and pilots as would be used in times of war. This amalgamation would lead to considerable economies, and had a very important bearing upon the position now under review in Mesopo-tamia and on the estimated strength of the future garrison there.In reply to a question by the Chairman, Sir H. M. Trenchard stated that the formation of the route between Ismailia and Baghdad was under consideration by his Department, but he doubted whether it would be ready before the end of this year. A further survey and examination of details was necessary. This had been taken into account in the preparation of the Air Force scheme, which was then being. discussed by General Sir Walter Congreve&apos;s Committee.The Chairman asked Sir Hugh Trenchard to ensure that every possible detail be included in his report, as it would eventually be circulated to the Cabinet with the minutes of all other meetings of the Conference. He suggested that the question of the projected route should be discussed with Sir Herbert Samuel when he arrived in Cairo.Sir Percy Cox asked that a representative of the railways in Irak might be present at the meeting which was to discuss the proposals.EXTRACT FROM MINUTES OF FIFTH MEETING OF THE COMBINED POLITICAL AND MILITARY COMMITTEE.March 19, 1921.(For remainder of minutes and composition of Committee see Appendix 13.)Air-Marshal Sir H, Trenchard submitted that it would be advisable to inform Sir Herbert Samuel of the suggested air route from Palestine to Irak, and he handed in agenda for the proposed Sub-Committee meeting to inquire into the matter.Sir Herbert Samuel was in full agreement with the idea, which he considered would not only improve communications between Palestine and Mesopotamia, but would have a very desirable political effect upon the tribes along the route. He nominated Captain F. G. Peake as his representative on the Sub-Committee.EXTRACT FROM MINUTES OF SIXTH MEETING OF THE COMBINED POLITICAL AND MILITARY COMMITTEE.March 19, 1921.(For remainder of minutes and composition of Committee see Appendix 13.)The report (Annexure 1) of the Sub-Committee, under the presidency of Air-Vice-Marshal Sahnond, was then read.Sir Herbert Samuel stated that the matter of the repair of the Es Salt-Amman section of the road should receive his urgent attention, and Sir Percy Cox promised that he would warn the tribes at the Eastern end of the route to assist the recon-naissance party on its arrival in their area.General Congreve agreed to the loan of an armoured-car detachment for a period of six weeks or two months to form a reconnaissance party, provided the extra expenses incurred on this special duty, such as repairs to cars and equipment, were borne by the Royal Air Force.Air-Vice-Marshal Salmond stated that the method by which he proposed to mark the route was by exploding charges of gelanite at distances of one mile. Local experiments showed that the craters thus formed were clearly visible from the air.In reply to Sir Herbert Samuel, Miss Bell stated that she had seen deep holes which had been dug ninety years ago along the route from Damascus to Mesopo-tamia, and which were as clear as they had ever been.   The white soil underneath
was very conspicuous, and the surface of the country was so stony that no sand blew over and filled in the craters.Sir Herbert Samuel agreed to lend the services of Captain Peake to the recon-naissance party as political officer.The Chairman questioned the figure of 50,000/. estimated by the Sub-Committee, and said that he considered 10,000/. would be ample; in all probability the cost ( would not reach this figure.Air-Vice-Marshal Salmond agreed.It was pointed out that the selection of a northern route would be in the interests . of the development of a railway from Mesopotamia to Palestine, if and when such a scheme were undertaken.General Radcliffe observed that the provision of a railway would save the Anglo-Persian Oil Company approximately 1,000,000/. per annum.Sir Herbert Samuel urged the desirability of the railway from the point of view of Palestine, and he trusted that the matter would be followed up, as it would materially contribute to the success of the proposed harbour at Haifa.Sir Percy Cox agreed with Sir Herbert Samuel as to the necessity for the railway. He pointed out that the matter could hardly be allowed to stand over indefinitely. It was essential that a definite policy should be laid down in order that commercial interests might be in a position to consider taking over the railways in Irak. Until the view of the British Government had been made clear they would not consider the matter. If the railway were not made he feared that the oil might be sent over the alternative route via Nisibin through the French zone, where no doubt very heavy transit charges would be levied.General A tkinson pointed out that the question of the line was of vital import-ance, not only to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, but also to the Government of Mesopotamia, and that it was urgent for a decision to be given in order to prevent capital being placed elsewhere. The company were quite prepared to carry on with the pipe line, provided they knew the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Chairman agreed that from the Imperial point of view7 the pipe line and railway were of the utmost importance. He agreed that a railway expert should accompany the reconnaissance party which Air-Vice-Marshal Salmond was sending out. He thought that until we had obtained definite proof of the success of our Arabian policy it was perhaps somewhat premature to make decisions. A saving of 1,000,000/. per annum to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company was equivalent at the present rate of interest to a capital saving of 17,000,000/., and he thought that it was so obviously in the interests of the company to make the pipe line that we need not entertain any very serious fears on account of a slight delay. However, he fully agreed that the survey might proceed, and he thought that the Government should bear this charge with the possibility of repayment from the company in the future. When the reconnaissance report was received he would recommend the formation of a special committee in London, at the meetings of which he would ask Sir A. T. Wilson to be present.
Annexure 1.Meeting of the Sub-Committee appointed to Report on the Proposed Air and Motor Car Route between Palestine and Mesopotamia, held on March 17-18, 1921.Present:Air-Vice-Marshal Sir W. G. H. Salmond (Chairman).Major-General E. H. de V. Atkinson.Colonel T. E. Lawrence.Captain F. G. Peake.Wing-Commander C. S. Burnett.Miss Gertrude Bell.A genda.To consider and report upon: 1. The steps which should be taken prior to the opening of an air route and track to take light motor traffic between Palestine and Mesopotamia, on the understanding that the method of opening the route will be by successive stages of 100 miles. The political aspect should engage particular attention.2. Review possible alternatives as to the direction the route should take and through which tribal districts it should pass.3. Financial considerations.Report of the Sub-Committee formed to Report on the Proposed Air and Motor CarRoute between Palestine and Mesopotamia.1. Routes Available. Two routes are considered: Northern Route (a.) via Amman-Azrak-Ramadi-Baghdad,. Southern Route (b.) via Maan-Jauf-Blaghdad.The distances involved are: (a.) 510 miles. (b.) 600 miles.As regards the northern route, water is known to be available at Azrak and Ain Wiza.This reduces the waterless area to be covered to 350 miles, whilst as regards the southern route, the waterless area would be 275 miles.Both of these waterless areas may be still further reduced by future . reconnaissances.On the other hand, the northern area is less liable to tribal interruption, is shorter and more direct. In addition, personnel arriving at Maan by the southern route would have to proceed to Amman in order to reach the main Palestine rail communication, thus adding a distance of 120 miles. This is a further argument in favour of the northern route.2. The Sub-Committee therefore consider that the balance of advantage in the selection of an air and motor route from Palestine to Mesopotamia appears to resl with a route running via Amman-Azrak-Ramadi, in view of (a.) The shorter distance involved. (&amp;.) Simpler tribal conditions. &apos;   (c.) Proximity to a projected railway line on the proposed all red route from the Mediterranean to Mesopotamia.The Sub-Committee recommend, therefore, that the first action to be taken should be to reconnoitre this route.3. They also recommend, that, at the forthcoming Conference at Jerusalem, the Emir Abdallah be asked to-(a.) Guarantee a safe-conduct and facilities to our cars at Amman.(&amp;.) To give facilities for the preparation of a landing ground at Amman.
(6*.) To provide a post at Azrak.(d.) To initiate friendly relations between the political officer attached to the Royal Air Force and the tribes concerned along the route, in particular the Ruwalla tribes.4. They suggest that his Excellency the High Commissioner, Mesopotamia, be asked to take the necessary steps to inform the tribes in his area of the intended expedition.5. The Sub-Committee consider that if the reconnaissance proves the northern route to be a suitable one, the road Jerusalem-Es. Salt-Amman should be placed in such a state of repair that Air Force supply cars be taken along this road. For the present, temporary repairs should be carried out between Es Salt and Amman, to enable motor transport to proceed from Jerusalem to Amman for the purpose of reconnaissance.6. The Sub-Committee also consider that as soon as satisfactory results have been obtained on the recommendations contained in paragraphs 3 and 4, the Royal Air Force should establish an aerodrome and car base at Amman, from where the first advanced base at Azrak would be established.In addition, four armoured cars should be attached to the Royal Air Force during the whole of the reconnaissances.Crossley light tenders should be used for the actual work of reconnaissance as well as portable wireless transmitting and receiving sets, which would form part of the equipment of the reconnoitring cars.7. The general method of reconnaissance would be as follows : A 50-mile forward stage by cars daily, supported by a further 50-mile forward stage by the Royal Air Force for air reconnaissance purposes.The object of the forward air reconnaissance is to report in detail on the country ahead and thus simplify the task of the car reconnaissance party.8. It is also suggested that his Excellency the High Commissioner of Palestine be asked to supply a political officer with experience of tribal conditions to be attached to the Royal Air Force for the purpose of the reconnaissance and to make any political arrangements that may be necessary for the safety of the party.9. The Sub-Committee recommend that the Egyptian Government Survey Department be asked to lend a surveyor to accompany the expedition.10. The Sub-Committee consider that a provision of 50,000/. should be ample for opening the route. This sum should be reduced considerably should the first reconnaissance prove successful.11. Major-General E. H. de V. Atkinson, in his capacity as Adviser of Public Works for the Government of Mesopotamia and a member of the Sub-Committee, asked that the following note on the projected railway communications between the Mediterranean and Mesopotamia be attached to the Committee&apos;s report: Note by Major-General E. H. de V. Atkinson, C.B., C.M.G., &amp;c, with regardto the possible future railway construction.Taking into consideration (a.) The Imperial importance of an all red railway route from the Mediter-ranean to the Persian Gulf, (&amp;.) The assistance a railway would be to the permanence of an air route from cairo to India and Australia,it is recommended that His Majesty&apos;s Government should lend all its weight to the construction of an all red route railway from the Mediterranean to Baghdad, with which the proposed air route would coincide as far as possible, in preference to the construction of a line via, Mosul, Nisibin and the Baghdad railway.It is &quot;recommended that the applicants for the concession should now be approached with a view to detailed investigation, and that during the Conferences in Palestine the support of the Emir Abdallah and other Arab authorities on the route should be invited, on the general principle that they could either be given shares in the railway or a subsidy in return for protection of material and personnel.[6117]
Annexure 2.Note by Sir Herbert Samuel, March 22, 1921. Hit-Haifa Railway and Pipe Line.Sir Arnold Wilson, who now represents the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and Pearson&apos;s, spoke to me about the proposed railway and pipe line to the Mediterranean.He said: 1. It would be three years before it would be known whether oil in Mesopotamia was a paying proposition, and two years after that before the railway and pipe line would be completed.2. The pipe line could not be undertaken unless a railway was built.3. His group would be prepared to take up the project seriously and to find the capital, but only if they obtained such guarantee as would offer a prospect of commercial success. Palestine might be asked to share in these guarantees.I said that Palestine was keenly interested in the project, as it would benefit its trade and develop the port of Haifa, but we were not in a position to give any financial guarantee. Sir A. Wilson asked whether the construction of the port of Haifa could be included as part of the scheme, and if so whether an area of land could be allocated to the contractors in payment, obtained either voluntarily or by requisition. This had been done at Bombay. I said that some such arrangement might be practicable. I pointed out that the plan of the railway contemplated that it should be continued across the Jordan valley, but that I doubted whether it was worth while to do this. The pipe line might be taken straight across the valley to Haifa, but was there any reason why we should not use the existing railway, via Deraa, from some junction in the neighbourhood of Amman, now that, under the Anglo-French Convention, we had the right to run our own trains over that route ? Sir A. Wilson was disposed to agree, but said that whoever ran the line from there to Hit would wish to have running rights over the railway Amman-Deraa-Haifa. He was sending a representative to accompany the air-route survey party. After their report was received an estimate of probable cost would be prepared, and he would then submit definite proposals for the whole project, including the port at Haifa.Appendix 31. Mandates and Boundaries.EXTRACT FROM MINUTES OF THE SECOND MEETING OF THE PALESTINE  POLITICAL  AND  MILITARY  CONFERENCE.March 18, 1921.(For remainder of minutes and composition of Committee see Appendix 17.)Sir Herbert Samuel raised the question of the Anglo-French boundary under the recent convention (Annexure 1). The article in the treaty stated that a mixed commission consisting of four members, one appointed by the British Government, one by the Government of Palestine, one by the French Government and one of the Syrian Government should be set up within three months of the signature of the treaty. The Commission should actually trace the frontier on the ground. It was of importance that this should be commenced and completed as soon as possible. The local population were now living in a state of suspense which was most unsatisfactory. Moreover, Palestine would be called upon to administer this territory and to pay the cost, and unless the boundary were settled in the near future and the territory occupied by the Palestine Government, the French authorities would meanwhile have collected the revenue, which would involve a corresponding loss to Palestine.
The Chairman concurred, and stated that delay had been caused as no reply had yet been received from the High Commissioner for Mesopotamia to a telegram asking for his views as to whether different commissions should be set up for Palestine and Mesopotamia, or whether one commission should define the frontier for both countries. It appeared that the matter could be very easily settled now that Sir Percy Cox and Sir Herbert Samuel were both present, and he asked that Major Young should discuss the matter with them and formulate proposals. The question of adding clauses to the two mandates (Annexure 2), to cover the administrative arrangements contemplated for Kurdistan and Trans-Jordania should be discussed at the same time. (Telegrams sent and received as a result of these discussions are attached (Annexure 3).)Annexure 1.Franco-British Convention of December 23, 1920, on certain points connected with the mandates for Syria and the Lebanon, Palestine and Mesopotamia.THE British and French Governments, respectively represented by the under-signed Plenipotentiaries, wishing to settle completely the problems raised by the attribution to Great Britain of the mandates for Palestine and Mesopotamia and by the attribution to France of the mandate over Syria and the Lebanon, all three conferred by the Supreme Council at San Remo, have agreed on the following provisions: Article 1.The boundaries between the territories under the French mandate of Syria and the Lebanon on the one hand and the British mandates of Mesopotamia and Palestine on the other are determined as follows : On the east, the Tigris from Jeziret-ibn-Omar to the boundaries of the former vilayets of Diarbekir and Mosul.On the south-east and south, the aforesaid boundary of the former vilayets southwards as far as Roumelan Koeui; thence a line leaving in the territory under the French mandate the entire basin of the western Kabur and passing in a straight line towards the Euphrates, which it crosses at Abu Kemal, thence a straight line to Imtar to the south of Jebul Druse, then a line to the south of Nasib on the Hedjaz Railway, then a line to Semakh on the Lake of Tiberias, traced to the south of the railway, which descends towards the lake and parallel to the railway. Deraa and its environs will remain in the territory under the French mandate; the frontier will in principle leave the valley of the Yarmuk in the territory under the French mandate, but will be drawn as close as possible to the railway in such a manner as to allow the construction in the valley of the Yarmuk of a railway entirely situated in the territory under the British mandate. At Semakh the frontier will be fixed in such a manner as to allow each of the two High Contracting Parties to construct and establish a harbour and railway station giving free access to the Lake of Tiberias.On the west, the frontier will pass from Semakh across the Lake of Tiberias to the mouth of the Wadi Massadyie. It will then follow the course of this river upstream, and then the Wadi Jeraba to its source. From that point it will reach the track from El Kuneitra to Banias at the point marked Skek, thence it will follow the said track, which will remain in the territory under the French mandate as far as Banias. Thence the frontier will be drawn westwards as far as Metullah, which will remain in Palestinian territory. This portion of the frontier will be traced in detail in such a manner as to ensure for the territory under the French mandate easy communication entirely within such territory with the regions of Tyre and Sidon, as well as continuity of road communication to the west and to the east of Banias.&apos; From Metullah the frontier will reach the watershed of the valley of the Jordan and the basin of the Litani. Thence it will follow this watershed southwards. Thereafter it will follow in principle the watershed between the Wadis Farah-Houroun and Kerkera, which will remain in the territory under the British mandate, and the Wadis El Doubleh, El Aioun and Es Zerka, which will remain in the terri-tory under the French mandate. The frontier will reach the Mediterranean Sea at the port of Ras-el-Nakura, which will remain in the territory under the French mandate.[6117]2 D 2
.1.1)8A commission shall be established within three months from the signature of the present convention to trace on the spot the boundary line laid down in article 1 between the French and British mandatory territories. This commission shall be composed of four members. Two of these members shall be nominated by the British and French Governments respectively, the two others shall be nominated, with the consent of the mandatory Power, by the local Governments concerned in the French and British mandatory territories respectively.In case any dispute should arise in connection with the work of the commission, the question shall be referred to the Council of the League of Nations, whose decision shall be final.The final reports by the commission shall give the definite description of the boundary as it has been actually demarcated on the ground; the necessary maps shall be annexed thereto and signed by the commission. The reports, with their annexes, shall be made in triplicate; one copy shall be deposited in the archives of the League of Nations, one copy shall be kept by the mandatory, and one by the other Govern-ment concerned.Article 3.The British and French Governments shall come to an agreement regarding the nomination of a commission, whose duty it will be to make a preliminary examination of any plan of irrigation formed by the Government of the French mandatory terri-tory, the execution of which would be of a nature to diminish in any considerable degree the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates at the point where they enter the area of the British mandate in Mesopotamia.Article 4.In virtue of the geographic and strategic position of the island of Cyprus, off the Gulf of Alexandretta, the British Government agrees not to open any negotiations for the cession or alienation of the said island of Cyprus without the previous consent of the French Government.Article 5.1. The French Government agrees to facilitate by a liberal arrangement the joint use of the section of the existing railway between the Lake of Tiberias and Nasib. This arrangement shall be concluded between the railway administrations of the areas under the French and British mandates respectively as soon as possible after the coming into force of the mandates for Palestine and Syria. In particular the agreement shall allow the administration in the British zone to run their own trains with their own traction and train crews over the above section of the railway in both directions for all purposes other than the local traffic of the territory under the French mandate. The agreement shall determine at the same time the financial, administrative and technical conditions governing the running of the British trains. In the event of the two administrations being unable to reach an agreement within three months from the coming into force of the two above-mentioned mandates, an arbitrator shall be appointed by the Council of the League of Nations to settle the points as to which a difference of opinion exists and immediate effect shall be given as far as possible to those parts of the agreement on which an understanding has already been reached.The said agreement shall be concluded for an indefinite period and shall be subject to periodical revision as need arises.2. The British Government may carry a pipe line along the existing railway track and shall have in perpetuity and at any moment the right to transport troops by the railway.3. The French Government consents to the nomination of a special commission, which, after having examined the ground, may readjust the above-mentioned frontier line in the valley of the Yarmuk as far as Nasib in such a manner as to render possible the construction of the British railway and pipe line connecting Palestine with the Hedjaz Railway and the valley of the Euphrates, and running entirely within the limits of the areas under the British mandate. It is agreed, however, that the existing railway in the Yarmuk valley is to remain entirely in the territory under the French mandate. The right provided by the present paragraph for the benefit of the British Government must be utilised within a maximum period of ten years.
The above-mentioned commission shall be composed of a representative of the French Government and a representative of the British Government, to whom may be added representatives of the local Governments and experts as technical advisers to the extent considered necessary by the British and French Governments.4. In the event of the track of the British railway being compelled for technical reasons to enter in certain places the territory under French mandate, the French Government will recognise the full and complete extra-territoriality of the sections thus lying in the territory under the French mandate, and will give the British Government or its technical agents full and easy access for all railway purposes.5. In the event of the British Government making use of the right mentioned in paragraph 3 to construct a railway in the valley of the Yarmuk, the obligations assumed by the French Government in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 of the present article will determine three months after the completion of the construction of the said railway.6. The French Government agrees to arrange that the rights provided for above for the benefit of the British Government shall be recognised by the local Govern-ments in the territory under the French mandate.Article 6.It is expressly stipulated that the facilities accorded to the British Government by the preceding articles imply the maintenance for the benefit of France of the provisions of the Franco-British Agreement of San Remo regarding oil.Article 7.The French and British Governments will put no obstacle in their respective mandatory areas in the way of the recruitment of railway staff for any section of the Hedjaz Railway.Every facility will be given for the passage of employees of the Hedjaz Railway over the British and French mandatory areas in order that the working of the said railway may be in no way prejudiced.The French and British Governments agree, where necessary, and in eventual agreement with the local Governments, to conclude an arrangement whereby the stores and railway material passing from one mandatory area to another and intended for the use of the Hedjaz Railway will not for this reason be submitted to any additional customs dues and will be exempted so far as possible from customs formalities.Article 8.Experts nominated respectively by the Administrations of Syria and Palestine shall examine in common within six months after the signature of the present conven-tion the employment, for the purposes of irrigation and the production of hydro-electric power, of the waters of the Upper Jordan and the Yarmuk and of their tributaries, after satisfaction of the needs of the territories under the French mandate.In connection with this examination the French Government will give its repre-sentatives the most liberal instructions for the employment of the surplus of these waters for the benefit of Palestine.In the event of no agreement being reached as a result of this examination, these questions shall be referred to the French and British Governments for decision.To the extent to which the contemplated works are to benefit Palestine, the Administration of Palestine shall defray the expenses of the construction of all canals, weirs, dams, tunnels, pipe lines and reservoirs or other works of a similar nature, or measures taken with the object of reafforestation and the management of forests.Article 9.&apos; Subject to the provisions of Articles 15 and 16 of the mandate for Palestine, of Articles 8 and 10 of the mandate for Mesopotamia, and of Article 8 of the mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, and subject also to the general right of control in relation to education and public instruction, of the local Administrations concerned, the British and French Governments agree to allow the schools which French and British nationals possess and direct at the present moment in their respective mandatory areas to continue their work freely; the teaching of French and English will be freely permitted in these schools.
The present article does not in any way imply the right of nationals of either of the two parties to open new schools in the mandatory area of the other.The present convention has been drawn up in English and French, each of the two texts having equal force.Done at Paris, the 23rd December, 1920, in a double copy, one of which will remain deposited in the archives of the Government of the French Republic, and the other in those of the Government of His Britannic Majesty.HARDINGE OF PENSHTJRST.

Annexure 3 (a).Paraphrase of Telegram from Mr. Churchill to the Colonial Office.(Received 4-45 p.m., March 21, 1921.)No. YZ 86. You will have gathered from private telegrams I am contemplating establishment of local administrations in Kurdistan and Trans-Jordania under authority of respective High Commissioners on somewhat different lines from those to be established in Mesopotamia and Palestine. It has been questioned here whether or not these proposals will necessitate any special provisions being made in respective mandates. For example, in article 1 of Mesopotamia mandate framing [6117] 2 F 2The Mandatory will secure the co-operation of the Mesopotamian Government, so far as social, religious and other conditions may permit, in the execution of any common policy adopted by the League of Nations for preventing and combating disease, including diseases of plants and animals.Article 11The Mandatory will secure the enactment within twelve months from the coming into force of this Mandate, and will ensure the execution of a Law of Antiquities, based on the contents of Article 421 of Part XIII of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey. This law shall replace the former Ottoman Law of Antiquities, and shall ensure equality of treatment in the matter of archaeological research to the nationals of all States, members of the League of Nations.Article 15.Upon the coming into force of the Organic Law an arrangement shall be made between the Mandatory and the Mesopotamian Government for settling the terms on which the latter will take over Public Works and other services of a permanent character, the benefit of which will pass to the Mesopotamian Government. Such arrangement shall be communicated to the Council of the League of Nations.Article 16.The Mandatory shall make to the Council of the League of Nations an annual report as to the measures taken during the year to carry out the provisions of the Mandate. Copies of all laws and regulations promulgated or issued during the year shall be communicated with the report.Article 17.The consent of the Council of the League of Nations is required for any modification of the terms of the present Mandate, provided that in the case of any modification proposed by the Mandatory such consent may be given by a majority of the Council.If any dispute whatever should arise between the members of the League of Nations relating to the interpretation or the application of these provisions which cannot be settled by negotiation, this dispute shall be submitted to the Permanent Court of International Justice provided for by Article 14 of the Covenant of the League of Nations.The present copy shall be deposited in the archives of the League of Nations. Certified copies shall be forwarded by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations to all Powers Signatories of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey.Made at the day of
of an organic law is provided for, and throughout mandate local authority is thence-forward referred to as Mesopotamian Government. As regards Palestine, articles 6 and 22 appear to present legal difficulties, as if my proposals are accepted certain of their provisions are inapplicable to Trans-Jordania. Two High Commissioners with whom I have discussed question agree that it would be preferable in mandates themselves to make no reference at all to Kurdistan or Trans-Jordania. If it is absolutely necessary from a legal point of view that slight inconsistencies in our treatment of these areas should be authorised they consider it would be better to specify areas affected without referring in detail to proposed difference in treatment. Please let me know without delay after consultation with legal advisers of Colonial Office and Foreign Office (1) whether any modification in terms of mandates is con-sidered indispensable; (2) whether it would be possible to add to each mandate a general clause leaving it to discretion of mandatory to interpret mandate in accord-ance with local conditions in specified areas. Churchill.Annexure 3 (b).Paraphrase of Telegram from the Colonial Office to Mr. Churchill, Cairo.(Sent 11-30 a.m., March 25, 1921.)The following is from Shuckburgh. Your telegram of the 21st March No. YZ 86. Mandates for Mesopotamia and Palestine in relation to Kurdistan and Trans-Jordania. Informal consultation has taken place between Colonial Office Legal Adviser and Assistant Legal Adviser to Foreign Office. On the assumption that the arrange-ments for Kurdistan sanctioned by Cabinet in Foreign Office telegram No. 193 to Cairo stand, and that provision is made in some way in final political arrangements as regards Trans-Jordania for its inclusion within the boundaries of Palestine as eventually fixed, but under a form of administration different from that of Palestine, however undesirable it may be for His Majesty&apos;s Government themselves to propose alterations of the mandates at this stage, they were inclined to view that when the &quot; A &quot; mandates come to be considered by the Council of the League it would be wise in this case to propose to that body the insertion in the Mesopotamian and Palestine mandates respectively of the following clauses: -1. (To be inserted after article 15 of the Mesopotamian mandate): &quot; Nothing in this mandate shall prevent the mandatory from establishing such an autonomous system of administration for the predominantly Kurdish areas in the northern portion of Mesopotamia as he may consider suitable.&quot;2. (To be inserted after article 24 of the Palestine mandate): &quot; In the territories lying between the Jordan and the eastern boundary of Palestine as ultimately determined, the mandatory shall be entitled to postpone or withhold application of such provisions of this mandate as he may consider inapplicable to the existing local conditions, and to make such provision for the administration of the territories as he may consider suitable to those conditions, provided no action shall be taken which is inconsistent with the provisions of articles 15, 16 and 18.&quot;These proposals have been made in an official letter to the Foreign Office, but we shall not get a reply until after the Easter holidays, as Lord Curzon is away. Meanwhile, you may wish to discuss suggestions informally with Sir Herbert Samuel.
Paraphrase of Telegram from Mr. Churchill, Cairo, to the Colonial Office.Dated March 19.(Received Colonial Office 845 p.m., March 19, 1921.)No. YZ 75.   Clear the line.  Addressed to Mr. Shuckburgh.Article 2 of Franco-British Convention has been discussed between two High Commissioners and myself. Please approach Foreign Office on following lines as soon as possible : Mesopotamian section cannot be delimited till after hot weather, and we there-fore wish delimitation to begin from Palestine end. The question of changing the personnel when the Palestine section is finished by Commission can be considered later, but it should be mentioned to French now as a possibility. High Commis-sioner, Palestine, is prepared for Commission to work as far as Imtar. I presume that article 29 of Treaty of Sevres, though it does not actually apply to work of this Commission, will govern the conditions of delimitation and snould be glad if French could be asked to agree. Strength of staff will presumably be decided by Foreign Office, as expenses will be borne by them. Provisions of article 2 of convention would appear to be sufficiently met if name of British Commissioner is communicated to &quot;the French before the 23rd March. Until I know my proposed policy for Eastern Palestine is approved, I cannot suggest names to be nominated by Palestine Administration. The name of Colonel Waters Taylor is suggested for head of Commission unless a better alternative can be suggested by Foreign Office or War Office, in which case I should like to be consulted before nomination is actually made. Important qualifications are knowledge of French, possibly also of Arabic, knowledge of local conditions and friendly relations with the French. Churchill.Annexure 3 (d).Paraphrase of Telegram from Mr. Churchill, Cairo. (Received at Colonial Office 11-30 a.m., March 21, 1921.)Clear the line. No. YZ 85.In continuation of my No. YZ 75. Franco-British Commission.I am strongly of opinion that best ends of both Governments will be served if French Government will agree to appoint an individual as their commissioner who is on good terms with us and is prepared to be accommodating. You should repre-sent this to Foreign Office. High Commissioner, Palestine, has suggested to me the name of Colonel Nieger, or, failing him, of Colonel de Meru.Appendix 32.-Hedjaz Railway.EXTRACT FROM MINUTES OF THE SECOND MEETING OF THE &apos;  PALESTINE  POLITICAL  AND  MILITARY  CONFERENCE.March 18, 1921.(For remainder of minutes and composition of Committee see Appendix 17.)Sir Herbert Samuel raised the question of the control of the Hedjaz railway. He stated that at present it was being managed by the British from Haifa toAnnexure 3 (c).
Recommendations of a Meeting held at Government House, Tuesday, March 29, 1921, to discuss the Hedjaz Railway.Present:Civil Secretary. Colonel Lawrence. Major Young. Colonel Holmes.Major the Hon. F. R. Somerset. Kaimakam Peake. Mr. Richmond.1. The Hedjaz railway being constituted as a single Wakf, and comprising the lines from Damascus to Medina and from Haifa to Deraa should be treated as a single administration.2. In view of the fact that by article 360 of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey, the Turkish Government abandons whatever rights it possesses over the Hedjaz railway and in any arrangements to be made for the railway by the Governments concerned, the special position of the railway from the religious point of view is to be fully recognised and safeguarded, we consider that as far as the territories subject to a British and French mandate are concerned, the general supervision of the line should be entrusted to Moslem representatives from those territories.3. There should be a board of control, which would meet at Deraa, composed of two Moslem representatives from each of the Governments through whose territories the line passes, i.e:, two each from the territories subject to the British and French mandate and from the Hedjaz.4. In view of the financial considerations advanced by Colonel Holmes, we con-sider it inadvisable at present to remove the workshops and head offices of the Hedjaz railway from Damascus to Deraa.5. The management of the line should be vested in three managers, one appointed by each of the three Governments concerned.In the event of differences of opinion, an appeal will lie to the Government or Governments concerned.Semakh, from whence to Deraa the French had control, but we had the right under the Anglo-French Convention to despatch trains over that section of the line and on to Nasif. It would be quite possible to supply troops at Amman by this means, though he felt that, in existing circumstances, and until our troops were there, it would be unwise to run trains along that route, as it would be possible for the Arabs to seize the rolling-stock and utilise it against the French. All that was required was some authority to organise the traffic on the railway as far as Amman, and he suggested that this might be vested in a joint board of French and British officials. Having once commenced a satisfactory service to Amman it was highly desirable that the remainder of the line to Medina should be opened up by arrange-ment with the Hedjaz.In reply to a question by the Chairman, Colonel Lawrence stated that this would raise the question of the frontier between the Hedjaz and Palestine, and although he agreed that it was desirable that the route should be reopened to assist the pilgrimage to Mecca, he pointed out that the section of the line south of Deraa had never been a paying concern. The profits had been made on the Damascus-Haifa section.Major Young agreed with Sir Herbert Samuel that the formation of a joint board would be the best solution, and; that it was for us to take the initiative, though he did not think it desirable to approach the Hedjaz until some arrangement had been made as to the control of the Nasib-Amman section. He noted that General Congreve, in contemplating the despatch of troops to Amman, had not counted upon their departure being held up by reason of the delay in supplying them by train.The Chairman observed that the question was very closely linked up with the subsidy to King Hussein, as a large pilgrimage by the railway route would increase the King&apos;s revenue and the necessity for a grant from us would be correspondingly reduced.
o6. The managers should be responsible in respect of the disposal and distribu-tion of the property of the railway to the board of control, in respect of manage-ment (running of trains, &amp;c), to their own Government.The board shall meet once a quarter and the three managers concerned should attend the meetings in an advisory capacity.7. All rolling-stock belonging to the Hedjaz railway, and now used on other lines, should be returned to the Hedjaz. railway.8. Finance. It is understood that in 1914 the Hedjaz railway, on a capital of six millions invested in the railwav itself, paid 3^ per cent.The remunerative portions oi the line are between Haifa and Damascus and between Deraa and Amman.We consider that the finances of the Hedjaz line must be treated as a whole, and that the allocation of revenue and expenditure be decided by the board of control, subject to the approval of the Governments concerned, and in accordance with the conditions of the Wakf.9. Further, .we suggest that there should be one auditor for the whole line, nominated by the board of control and approved by the three Governments.
