(This Docwmsent is the Property ofHOME AFFAIRSCOMMITTEEindustrial assurance BILL.. Referred toCommittee of Home AffairsMF&amp;ORAHDUM BY THE HOME SBOPJTARYoIn 1919 and 1920 a Committee, of whioh Lord Parmoor was Chairman, enquired into the business carried on by Industrial Aasuranoe Oompanioa and Oollooting Societies?,   Thoy found that tho existing law left room for considerable abusea and made a number of recommendations with a view.to bringing such Companies and Sooieties under stricter oontrol and seouring better nroteoblon for the polioy holders.I was asked by Mr. Chamberlain when he was chancellor of the Exohequer to tako oharge of a Bill to oarry out these recommendations.   A draft Bill has been prepared whioh oonsolidatos the existing law and introduoea a number of amendments mainly dirooted to carrying out the proposals of the Committee,   Copies are attached   of the Report of the Qoraraditee and of a memorandum by Mrc Robertson, the&apos; Registrar of Friendly Societies,, and Sir Alfred Watson, the Government Aotuary.In view of the state of Parliamentary business, it will be impossible to carry a Bill on this aubjeot at this stage of the Session, but at an earlier stage of the Session the Home Office representative in the House of Lords stated that it was the intention of the Government to introduce legislation this Session and I think it is desirable that the Bill should be introducod,, in order that all the persona concerned may know what are the proposals and that we may find out before next Session what amount of opposition there will bo to the Bill and to what points oritioism would bo ohiefly directed.   Legislation next Session will be considerably facilitated by preliminary discussion and - if it proyoti desirable - by further negotiations on points of controversy with the parties concorned. I aooordingly ask for authority to introduce the draft Bill attached.   It might bo introduced in the House of Lords on the understanding that the Government spokesman will explain that it will not be practicable to carry through legislation this Session and that the motion for Second Reading is intended to give an opportunity to those who are interested in the subjeat to express their views so that the Government may have tho advantage of considering any oritioisms that may be made before the Bill is re*-introduoed next Session,,There is a strong demand for legislation on this subject and the groater part of the Bill consists either&apos;of consolidating provisions or of previsions on whioh the agreement of the Companies and Societies oonoerned has been substantially secured;,16/7/31
INDUSTRIAL ASSURANCE BILL,IvffiMORANDUM BY THE CHIEF REGISTRAR OF FRIENDLY societies and THE GOVERNMENT ACTUARY8 ..............................This Bill is intended to protect persons who have taken out or may-hereafter take Gut policies of industrial assurance-with industrial assurance dompanies or oolleoting  societies from the abuses disclosed on pages 1 to 8 of the Report of the Board of Trade Industrial Life Assuranoe Committee (the &quot;Papmoor Committee&quot;)tf 1920, CadB 614*It follows olosely,, with miner modifications necessitated for drafting purposes;; the reoommendations of that Committee as set out on pages 8 to 15 of the Reportc by way of amendment to the Collecting Societies and Industrial Assurance Companies Aot; 1896? and to those portions of the Assuranoe Companies Aotn 1909, and the Courts (Eraergonoy Powers) Aot0 1914&amp; whioh relate to industrial assurance^   It also includesb by way of consolidation, those portions of the two first-mentioned ActsP whioh are not amended by it.It Is therefore unnecessary in this memorandum to deal with those portions of the Bill? which are covered by the Report? But there are a ff:v? oaees i:i which the Bill goes beyond the Report in the matters dealt with by the Report or includes matters not dealt with by the Report and these will be briefly enumerated,.Clause It    Confines the business of industrial assuranoe toincorporated companies and registered oolleoting sooieties3   Hitherto there hat: been no restriction and when the increased stringency of control is introduced^ it is obviously desirable that no one should be able to evade it by parrying on business through an unincorporated &quot;or unregistered body on which the Inspeotor^General will not be able to lay his handaThis clausei as now drawn, also assimilates for the first time oolleoting societies and industrial assurance oorapanies in the matter of the differentiation between ordinary and industrial businesso Hitherto^, in the case of the coiapaniesj their industrial business alone? hut in the case of the societies.y the whole of their business has been subject to the statutory restrictions0   The reason for this was thatj when the 1896 Aot was pasaedj the collecting societies had practically no. ordinary business^ whereas nowj in se7eral oascs9 it is very substantial^ and there appears to be no good reason why their ordinary business should be brought within the scope of theEill any more than the ordinary businec of the companies0   This Clause has,..........tho/thereto-e^heer- a.ltered aocordiwgW&quot; a&apos;n&apos;d* consequentiai alterationshove been mads in other parts of the Billy seej in particular5 clause SeClause 1 (2),  The Committee (paragraph 390 section l) suggested the retention cf the eld limit of ten miles., with a possible reduction to five miles or less in the case of London and possibly some other large cities*   On
further consideration it has been considered that this limit is artifioial and renders control diffioult.  Moreover within a limit of even five miles in London it would be possible to run a very largo oolleoting sooiety outaido the restrictions of the Aot.  It has therefore been thought weL1 to abolish the spaoe limit altogether.there aro^ however, some 380 registered burial dooieties, most of whioh employ collectors, but whioh collect within the 10 mile limit and have therefore not hitherto been eubjeot to the legislation governing oolleoting societies.  Most of them are quite respectably conducted and most of them would bo unable to.make a deposit of  20000.  Clause 7 (4), therefore9 exempts these from making the deposit under the conditions therein contained,   There would probably bo no objeotion to exempting them from some or most of the other provisions of the Aotp if representations were made on their behalf for that purpose.Clause 4*    Imposes limits1 on the amounts whioh may be expended on manage-ment (inoluding commissions).  The Departmental Committee proposed to prohibit the payment of ttproouraiion foes&quot; for new business and to require agents to be paid^ in general, by fixed salary rather than by commission.  These proposals are strongly opposed by the Companies (see the latter part of this Memorandum) and enquiries lead to the belief that they would prove ineffectual in praotioe*   The objeot aimed -at oan be achieved much more directly by limiting the amount that may be spent in commission and expenses leaving the Companies and Sooieties to arrange the terms of remuneration of their employees in their own way subject to the total expenditure not exceeding the statutory limit.The proposed allowances are 40 per oentt   of the weekly premiums and 26 per cento of the other industrial (i.e, monthly) premiums.   These peroentages may seem higji but so long as the business is done by .* collection from door to door its oost must always be heavy.During the last few years and even sinoe the Committee reported, the expenditure of the Companies has been rapidly going up. owing to the expansion of &quot;new business&quot;, partly^ no doubt, under the influenoe of heavy procuration fees.   The following figures of four of the big Companies are sufficiently illustrative of this feature.Peroentage of all industrial premiums spent on management and commission.	1918,	1919.	1920.&apos;Prudential	37	38	40Britannic t	41	44	47Refuge	42	46	50Wesleyan and General,	43	48	52
in 1920 these four Companies oolleoted  19,000,000 in    -Industrial, premiums and spent over  8,200,000 of this sum in expenses and commission,,The proposals of the Bill would out the percentage down to about 36 in the case of the Prudential (whioh alone has a large amount of business on monthly premiums and aooordingly should show a lower expense ratio than its competitors) and to about 40 per oent, in the other oases0. The new olause comes into operation with 1923 thus giving the Oompanies 18 months in whioh to conform to the new conditions of doing businesstClause 6,    This goes slightly beyond the reoommendation in paragraph 51 of the Report^ by providing for the return of the premiums^ and not merely the payment of the surrender valueff in the oase of illegal policies issued after the oommenoement of the Aot0   It seemed to us that the payment of the surrender value was not a sufficient deterrent in the case of illegal polioies issued after the Aot oame into foroe.Clause 18 (o)s (d)8   In order to bring under control the present unsatisfactory position as to Valuations the Report (par. 47) recommended that any valuation made after seven years from the passing of the Aot should be made on a prescribed basisa and as to valuations within that period recommended certain restrictions on the present praotioe.   As a result of discussions between Sir AoW8 Watson and the actuaries of the oompanies, the Bill extends the 7 years to 821 years, but at the same time provides for an ordinary valuation (subjeot to the new restrictions) in every oase as at six months after the commencement of tho Aot(i  We think this   is a reasonable arrangement, and the latter provision has the advantage of putting all the sooieties and companies under the obligation of making a valuation at the first possible period after the commencement of the Aot.   Otherwise, % for instances a company or sooiety which was only valued every five years   and had had a valuation as at the end of  1920 ji would not make another valuation till the end of 1925.Olause 24 ($)*   The Report (par0 33 (i))   recommends that the rights of the polioy holder as to free paid-up policies and surrender values should be stated on the notice of forfeiturea   It was pointed out to us that this was undesirable, as constituting an invitation to the policy holder to oease to keep up his policy and take what he oould get, and we agreed. We have therefore substituted the provision contained in this sub-olause*Clause 28.    This carries out substantially what was proposed by theCommittee (par6 60) but in a slightly different way8   The technical prolongation of the war has conferred an unexpected and unnecessary extension on the Courts (Emergency Powers) Aotj l9X4j as regards industrial insuranoo and, after much consideration, we have concluded that the best way to deal with the situation is that embodied in the present olause.
Clause 42,    This has boon inserted at the request of the Board of Trade, It deals with a matter whioh is only oognate to the other subjeot matter of the Bill by reason of the not that it seeks to remedy an abuse suffered by the same olaso of persons as the rest of the Aot is intended to protect.Oortain undesirable persone, who used to conduct an elaborate system of loan societies registered under the Friendly Sooieties Aot, 1896, by a speoial authority issued by the Treasury, now exeroise their activities by means of registered oompanies.   The reason of the change was that the Chief Registrar of Friendly Sooieties made things so unpleasant for them by a series of prosecutions that they thoupht they would be more oomfortable in the ampler ether  of the Companies Department.   Their rest there has been hitherto undistrubed owing to teohnioal defects in the Assuranoe Companies Aot, 1909, whioh this clause is intended to remove,ThiB memorandum may be concluded with a few remarks on the attitude towards the Bill of the persons most interested.   They are (l) the oompanies and sooieties (2) the agents or oolleotors (3) the persons who purport to speak on behalf of the policy holders,(l).        The Association of Industrial Assuranoe Companies and Collecting Friendly Scoieties, whioh represents all the principal bodies exoept the Prudential, asked permission of the Government to make representations and they, together with the General Manager of the Prudential, were interviewed by the Chief Registrar of Friendly Sooiaties and  Sir A,W, Watson,It appeared at these interviews that there would be little, if any, opposition on their part to most of the.recommendations of the parmoor Committee, if embodied in the Bill, but there were threo matters on whioh opposition emerged, namely the abolition of procuration feos and the substitution of a minimum weekly wage for commission on collections, war bond polioiee (olause 30) and the effeot of an agent*s filling up a proposal form (olause 20 (i5) ), The position is best shown by the following extraota from the report of the interviews made at the time  by the Chief Registrar and Sir A.W, Watson im&quot;1,   Procuration fees,   (Paragraph 42 of the Oommittee&apos;s Report)*Tho Committee, for the reasons there given., recommend the abolition of procuration fees, and the substitution of a minimum weekly wage aAs to the substitution of a minimum weekly wage^ we are not confident that the Committee intended this to be embodied in the proposed legislations  We rather think that they regarded it as something which would probably follow by the action of the Companies and socleties themselves^ if procuration fees were
abolished by statute.  We do not think, in fact, that it would be either praotioable or desirable, that a minimum wage should be imposed by statute, and it is oertain that it would be most strenuously resisted by the Companies and societies, so muoh so that it was practically impossible to diaousa it with them.As to the abolition of procuration fees, the offices objeoted strongly to it (a) on general grounds, of unfair discrimination against one particular form of business, whioh would not be in the interests of tho general communityj (b) on the ground of the impraotioability of conducting their business with suooess, if this inoentive to inoreased business were abolishedj (c) on the ground of the neoessity of allowing suoh fees if the agent wore to  obtain a living wage.The Committee^ on the other handi were oonvinoed that the abolition of procuration fees was the most effeotive way of preventing the excessive lapso rate of polioies in their early stages iThe Chief Registrar, in an endeavour to meet the Oompanies and sooieties, proposed that procuration fees should he forbidden on policies whioh had remained in foroo less than 13 weeks, and we.....       , ...were fortified in our belief in the reasonableness of the suggestion bv the fact that the Prudential independently proposed in their memorandum that a limited procuration fee should be allowed where the business had been maintained for some agreed period.   This Company, therefore, which is by far the most important, did not dissent from the proposal, if it were so limited, and the Offices would not be unanimous in opposing the proposal if amended as suggested a   But no doubt the agents, who are strongly organised, would resist the proposal,,   It is for the Government to oonsider what course should be taken in preparing the Bill in these oiroumstanoes,&quot;(it will now be seen from tb* forecoing note on olaitse 4 that another method of dealing witr excessive expenditure is proposed^ in lieu of that recommended by the Committee,)W2*  War- Bond Policies^, (Paragraph 44 of the Oommitteefs Report),The Association and the Prudential alike resist the proposal that the controlling authority should be able to revise these policies as to lapse and surrender where the assured are unable to fulfil their obligations.Their attitude was not altogether oonsistent, sinoe both the Prudential and the Pearl, the two Companies who issued almost all the existing policies of this kind, alleged that their polioies were perfectly fair and even generous in their terms, in faot that they were the best short-term endowment polioies on the market.   They also seemed to fail to appreciate the exceedingly oareful terras in whioh the proposal was limiteda   Their real reaaon for resistance appears
to be that they think that by not resisting they would be admitting that there was something wrong with the polioios, and expressed themselves to be oonfident that, if the proposal was put in the Bill, they oould oonvinoe the House of the exoellenoe of their polioies and the purity of their conductsIn view of the strong publio feeling whioh appears to exist on this subject, and of the fact that if the proposal were not embodied in the Bill it is sure to be moved from some other source, the Government mi$it think it best to put it in the Bill  and let them try0ift3*   That an a,qent filling up a proposal form should be the, a^ent for the Company and not, for the proposer,   (Committee*s Report Paragraph 45 (2) (a) ).The Prudential did not resist this in principle^ but reserved further oomment until they saw the actual clause^   The Association declined to agree.   The ostensible ground of their objeotion was that it would open the door to fraud by ttn-sorupulous persons,, who would get possession- to their own advantage; of polioies, which had been obtained on wilfully untrue proposals, rendered binding on the oompany or society owing to this recommendation of tho Committee,,   Their real reason, we think, is that they do not trust their agents; and it is against frauds by agents that tho proposal is mainly directed.   The Associationj however made a useful suggestion that the terms of the proposal should be set out in the polioys so that the assured would be less able to repudiate his knowledge of what the proposal Contained,,   They intended this as an alternative to the Committee^ recommendation^ biitj in our opinions it Is not an alternative but an additional safegr.pxd3 and the Government might well oonsidsr whother3 vrtth this addition^ the recommendation; since the opposition is not unanimoust ought not to go into the Billo&quot;&quot;in oonclusicnj wo have so far dealt from the point of view of substanoe with the cases where the proposals of tho Committee are definitely opposedo  We now wish to say something as to the praotioal positionu   The impression we dorived from the interviews was that&apos; the Companies and societies represented boforo us were genuinely anxious for legislation tc put an end to those abuses whioht in their opinion^ oould be dealt with by legislation - indeedj in some respects, they even suggested a screwing up of the Bill to make it more effective6 It is in our opinion, of vital importance that there should be legislation as soon as possiblet   In the prospective state of publio business, we gather^ there would be difficulties in passing a measure which met with any considerable opposition   From a practical point of view, therefore while we regard the proposals which are opposed as being of very g?eat importance, we thinly as time is of equal or even greater importance^ it should be oonsiderod whether the balance of.publio interest i3 not In favour of getting suoh

The effeot of the Aot, even if the opposed proposals were omitted,, would undoubtedly be to effeot a olearanoe within a comparatively short time of the less reputable companies and societies^ a most important and desirable result^ and future proposals for legislation may well be modified by a consideration of the position which will exist after suoh olearanoe haa been effected.&quot;(2).        Some of the agents1 unions have intimated their desire to make representations, but have made none? and it is therefore unoertain what their attitude will be.  It may, however0   be taken as certain that they would strenuously object to clause 4a(3) Those who purport to a peak for the policy holders win naturallywelcome any restrictions whioh the Bill seeks to imposej and their efforts may be directed to seouring the insertion of even more drastio provisions, but as the Bill embodies all the reoommendations of the Parmoor Committee and fcndeed goes beyond them in some respects, they ought to be satisfied.The Labour Party presumably must be regarded aa representing both class (s) and olasy (3)9 and this conflict of interest should make their attitude exceptionally interesting not to say plquantc

BOARD OF TRADE INDUSTRIAL LIFE ASSURANCE COMMITTEE.REPORTof theDepartmental Committee appointed by the Board of Trade to enquire into the business carried on by Industrial Assurance Companies and Collecting Societies.To the Right Honourable Sir AUCKLAND C. GEDDES, K.C.B., M.P., President of the Board of Trade.Sir,The Committee have the honour to submit their Report and Recommendations.1. The Committee were appointed under your Minute, dated 14th May 1919,&quot; To enquire into the business carried on by Industrial Assurance Companies and Collecting Societies, exclusive of the issue of life assurance policies involving the payment of sums exceeding 501. on the death of the assured and of insurance business under the National Health Insurance Act, and to report whether any amendment of the law is desirable.&quot;2. The first private sittings of the Committee were held in June in order to discuss procedure, and it was decided that all the evidence should be taken in public. Certain questions were addressed to all the companies and societies as a preliminary to the enquiry and to facilitate the examination of witnesses in the public proceedings, but as the preparation of the necessary answers to the questionnaire involved a considerable amount of work on the part of the companies and societies no sittings for taking evidence could effectively be held until the beginning of October.The voluminous nature of the replies received to the questionnaire has prevented their publication in full, but a copy of the questions and certain tables containing a summary of the information which is considered to be of most public interest are set out in Appendix A.3. A circular letter was also addressed by the Secretary of the Committee to the Registrars of the County Courts and the clerks to magistrates in a number of the large industrial centres of the United Kingdom with the object of obtaining information as to complaints brought into the Courts by policy-holders and their dependents in recent years, and some useful written evidence was received from these sources.4. All sittings for the hearing of evidence were held in public; 41 witnesses were examined and full opportunity was given to bring forward complaints. No evidence was excluded which, in the opinion of the Committee, was relevant to the enquiry or could be of any assistance to them, in conducting an investigation in terms of the reference.Evidence was given by representatives on behalf of the agents. This evidence was of great assistance, and the Committee desire to express their appreciation of the way in which it was given.The companies and societies against whom complaints were made were accorded ample opportunity to give explanations as to such complaints, and on points arising in the answers supplied to the questions sent to them.5. The magnitude of the interests concerned is shown by the fact that the total amount of premiums received in respect of policies in the Industrial Branch of the companies and societies in the year 1918 exceeded 25,000,0002., that the number of policies in existence at the end of that year were about 51,000,000, and that the total number of whole-time and spare-time agents and collectors employed was estimated to number 70,000.6. The institutions affected comprise 18 companies registered under the Companies Acts which are subject to the control of the Board of Trade, and are liable to the provisions of the Assurance Companies Act, 1909, and 56 collecting societies which are registered under the Friendly Societies Acts and fall within the jurisdiction of the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies; the relative &quot;proportions of the business held by the companies and collecting societies being about four-fifths and one-fifth respectively. The operations of both companies and societies are also subject, in certain respects, to the provisions of the Collecting Societies and Industrial Assurance Companies Act, 1896.o  10664 b
The System of Industrial Assurance.7. The business of Industrial Assurance consists in the assurance of small sums, payable for the most part on the death of the life assured, in consideration of the payment of weekly premiums. In a small proportion of the business the sum assured is payable, as an alternative, on the happening of some other event, generally the attainment of a stipulated age, and in respect of a small percentage of the policies the premiums are payable at monthly intervals. In the main, however, the characteristic features of the contract are that the sum assured is payable at death, and the premiums are paid at weekly intervals.8. The relation of the sum assured and the premium payable is governed by the age of the assured at entry into assurance, the tables of rates almost invariably showing the sum assured for a premium of Id. a week, typical amounts being, at age 1.1 next birthday, 101. 17s.; at age 20, 81. 18s.; at age 40, 41. 16s.; at age 60, 21.; and at age 70, 11. 5s.9. The assurance of children is a prominent feature of the business, a large proportion of the policies being effected at, or immediately after, the birth of the child. Under the Friendly Societies Act the amount payable on the death of a child under five years of age is limited to 6L, while between the ages of five and ten the amount payable may not exceed 101. The amounts actually assured &quot;on the lives of children are on an increasing scale, according to age, within these limits.10. The average premium on all policies is under 2\d. a week, and the average sum assured between 111. and 12Z.11. Industrial assurance appeals chiefly to the working classes, and has a possible clientele of about 35,000,000 persons. From the fact that there are 51,000,000 policies in existence and that some millions of these are on the lives of children under 10 years of age, in whose case it is unusual for more than one policy to exist, it is evident that great numbers of adults are assured under two or more policies. Where there is more than one policy on a single life the policies are frequently held by different persons. Great laxity has prevailed in this respect. For many years, policies were freely issued to persons other than the lives assured under them, and in 1909 Parliament found it necessary to intervene with the object of controlling this practice. The Friendly Societies Act (section 8) authorises assurances for the funeral expenses of a husband, wife, widow, or child, and by section 36 of the Assurance Companies Act, 1909, a policy may be effected to pay for the funeral expenses of a parent, grandparent, grandchild, brother, or sister. Whilst imposing these limits upon insurability, Parliament also provided for the validation of certain classes of policies existing in 1909 which had been effected in the absence of insurable interest, but where at the time such policies were effected there was a bona, fide expectation that the persons who effected them would incur expenses in connection with the death or funeral of the assured,It is doubtful whether the practice of issuing illegal policies has entirely ceased. How-ever this may be, the Committee are satisfied that in many cases premiums continue to be paid on illegal policies effected before 1909 to the advantage of the companies and their agents, hut with doubtful security to the holders of the policies. There is no doubt that, in many such cases, the persuasion of the agent has been an important factor in the issue of the policy.12. The system of industrial assurance would not be possible without the collection of the premiums weekly at the homes of the people, and this process is carried out by the employment of an army of collectors, generally styled agents, numbering, it is understood, about 70,000. The remuneration of the agent is based upon the amount he collects, and is frequently a direct percentage of that amount, varying from 25 per cent, in the case of the collecting societies to 15 to 20 per cent, in the case of the companies. In addition to this allowance for collecting his &quot;renewal&quot; premiums, the agent is directly remunerated for the &quot;new business&quot; he secures. There are various ways of calculating this allowance, but it is always on a generous basis. In some cases the agent takes the whole of the premiums collected during an agreed period following the issue of the policies, i.e., the first 12, 14, or 16 weeks. In other cases lapses are set off against new business, and the new business emoluments of the agent are calculated wholly or partly on his &quot; increase.&quot; Thus the Prudential pays 10 times the weekly premium on each new policy provided that it is kept in force for 13 weeks, and 18 times the net increase in the weekly debit. The terms of remuneration vary widely in details, but it would appear that, on the general average, the agents of the companies retain about 25 per cent, of all the premiums they collect while those of the large collecting societies may receive as much as 30 per cent. In the case of the Royal Liver, which is a collecting society and the management of which appears to be very much under the control of the agents, it was admitted that, between one item of remuneration and another, the agents have succeeded in obtaining for themselves about 31 per cent, of the weekly premiums paid by the members.13. It is not surprising to find, in these circumstances, that about 44 per cent, of the total premium income on industrial policies, is absorbed by expenses and commission and, in the case of the companies, by dividends to shareholders (see Appendix B.). Thus, of every Is. paid in premiums, 5^d. goes in expenses of one sort and another, and only 6fd. comes back to the assured in benefits.   Otherwise stated, of 25,000,0001. a year paid in premiums by the
insured population, 14,000,0001 only come back to them, and .11,000,000/. are absorbed in expenses and dividends. The Committee are satisfied that these expenses are too heavy and can be reduced.14. Tho agents of the companies have represented to the Committee the inadequacy, as they allege, of their remuneration, emphasising in this respect the difference between their position and that of. the employees of the collecting societies. The Committee do not feel called upon to pronounce as&apos; to the points at issue between the companies and their employees, but it is clear from the figures given above that, if there is under-payinent, ,as asserted, it is not due to any undercharge on the assured for the services rendered to them. It may, the Committee think, be attributed, in the main, to the excessive numbers employed on the collecting staffs. For this the system must be adjudged responsible. As it is operated, the collecting work of the agent occupies only a moderate part of his time, leaving him ample opportunity for canvassing for new business. He is not only expected by his superiors to exert himself to the full, in this direction, but the terms of his remuneration seem in many cases to be such that, without fair success in his efforts, he will fail to get a &quot; living wage &quot; from his work. For example, it is found that, for collecting a 101. book, a commission agent of the Prudential from this source gets a salary of 32s. 6c/. a week. If a man with such a book is to obtain a wage on which he can maintain himself and his family it is clear that he must secure and keep securing a large number of new customers.15. Evidence was given before the Committee that convenience and economy in collection could be improved by the introduction of the block system, under which an agent is assigned an exclusive area for his operation. This system is still in the experimental stage, but the Committee suggest that it should be introduced and extended wherever practicable. They are of opinion that by the general adoption of this system a large amount of unnecessary labour and expenditure might be avoided.16. The conditions being as described above, it is no matter for wonder that the most strenuous efforts of everybody concerned are devoted to the procuration of new policies, and that in the unceasing campaign which goes on there is little thought for the development of industrial insurance upon the sound economic lines by which it might become a valuable instrument of thrift. It is seldom the case, so far as the Committee can judge, that the bread-winner of a family is himself assured for a substantial amount, despite the large sum paid in premiums by the average family. Mothers are solicited to effect assurances on all the lives of the family; young people are importuned to insure their parents ; and relations of the elderly, near and remote, are induced to take out policies where often there is no insurable interest or any prospect of having to pay necessary funeral expenses.17. On examining the returns rendered to the Board of Trade the Committee have been much impressed by the indications of the extent to which policies have been taken out on lives of comparatively advanced age, where the premiums are very heavy compared with the sums assured. In the case of the Refuge, two-thirds of the whole amount of the premiums on the whole-life weekly business is paid in respect of persons who are over 50 years of age, and an analysis of the returns indicates that the average duration of all these policies is under seven years. The inference is clear that in the case of this company one of the largest  the bulk of the business is done among a class of the public which insures the lives of relations as a regular practice. The witness representing the company did not dissent from a suggestion to this effect.18. Under the system of industrial assurance as it is practised, the great majority of the policies effected lapse within a short time. In the case, for instance, of the Refuge (which, in this connection, is in no way exceptional) it is found that, in the 10 years 1909 to 1918, 9,322,336 policies were issued, while 6,426,313 lapsed.This question can be further examined by reference to the statistics as to neAv business and lapses furnished to the Committee by certain of the companies and societies. It is found from the figures supplied that in ten of the offices (including most of the largest) nearly 5,000,000 policies lapsed in the year 1913, and that nearly 4,000,000 of these had been effected so recently as 1912 or 1913. It is probable that the premiums paid on these latter policies amounted to fully 500,000/., practically the whole of which must have been absorbed in new 1 business charges, chiefly procuration fees and commissions paid to the agents. Taking all the offices together it is probable that lapses of policies in the year of issue or in the year following reach an annual total of 5,000,000. This vast figure can only mean that there is a section of the population Avhich is repeatedly induced by the pressure of agents and canvassers to take out policies and which discontinues payment immediately that pressure is removed, having lost nearly the whole of whatever premiums it has paid, since the benefit assured at the outset is a mere fraction of the full sum named in the policy. So long as heavy procura-tion fees are allowed it will always pay the agents to devote themselves to the ceaseless pursuit of new business among this class of the community regardless of the value of the policies to the assured or of the probability that they will be kept up.19. A significant feature of the pursuit of &quot; new business&quot; is the trade of the &quot;special canvasser.&quot;   As the name implies, the special canvasser obtains his livelihood by procuringB 2
new business. He may, perhaps, have been an agent who has discovered in himself an exceptional capacity for persuasion, and he has forsaken the routine of steady collection for the excitement and emoluments of canvassing. He is not an employee of any particular company ; he is not, as a rule, even retained by the company in whose name lie is acting for the time being, and he is therefore trammelled by no sense of responsibility to the prospective assured. He is employed apparently by an agent or local superintendent, desirous of securing an &quot;increase&quot; beyond his own powers or impelled to it, perhaps, by the pressure of his company. The two, apparently, go the round of the agent&apos;s customers together, the agent ostensibly to collect, and the canvasser to employ his specialised arts in inducing the new proposal, the procuration of which is the real purpose of the call. It is scarcely to be doubted that many of the misunderstandings which have arisen in the minds of policy-holders, and of the misrepresentations of which allegation has been made, are due to this irresponsible method of forcing business.20. The Committee refer above to the difference between the companies and the collecting societies in regard to the terms on which the agents are remunerated. It is not to be inferred that the assuring public obtains better value from the companies than from the societies because the agents get less. There is in each case a margin in the premium over and above the costs of assurance and economical administration, but only in one case, that of a small local collecting society (Aberdeen and Northern), have the Committee found that margin enure consistently to the benefit of the policy-holders. In the case of the large collecting societies it is secured by the agents and is reflected in the sale value of their collecting books, which appear to he freely marketable at high prices. In the case of the companies it is partly absorbed by the costs of an elaborate organisation and partly by the very substantial dividends paid to the shareholders. It.has been shown that, in the case of the Royal Liver, the agents obtain 31 per cent, of the premiums which they collect, and the effect of this is seen in the frequent advertisement of collecting books of that society for sale at prices running up to 20 or 30 times the weekly collection, i.e., a sum of 2001. to 3001. being asked, and no doubt paid, for the privilege of collecting 101. a week (of which the agent is entitled to 21. 10s.) with its attendant opportunities. Among the companies, on the other hand, while smaller corn-missions are paid to the agents, there appear such cases as the Prudential and the Refuge in which the payments to shareholders and officials&apos; respectively are conspicuous. The share-holders of the Prudential received before the war 600,0001. a year as dividends on a capital of 1,000,0001., and latterly 400,0001., in each case free of income tax. Of these sums by far the greater part was provided by the Industrial Branch. The Refuge Company has eight (recently seven) directors. In addition to very ample dividends on the share capital, of which, as the Company states, they own the greater part, these directors have latterly been dividing between themselves in directors&apos; fees (voted by the shareholders), directors&apos; salaries (voted by themselves), and salaries as officials (authorised by themselves as directors) something like 7O,000Z. a year.21. The collecting societies are, in principle, self-governing bodies and are administered by committees of management elected, in form, by the members, voting either in. general meeting or through delegates. It would, however, be a mistake to suppose that, in either case, the members of the societies exercise any greater control over their own affairs than policy-holders do over those of the companies of which they are admittedly no more than customers. To whatever causes this may be due and the apathy of the assured is certainly only one of them the fact is that the control of the organisation, in the case of all the large societies, has been secured by the agents, i.e., by the servants of the societies. The various committees of management are appointed, to a large extent, from among the agents, and are, apparently, more accountable for their actions to the associated agents than to the members. The same must be said of the delegates of the members in the cases where this system of government obtains. These delegates are, theoretically, the freely elected representatives of &quot;the members, but, in fact, they appear to be very much the nominees of the agents, who are admitted- to exercise great influence in their appointment. It follows inevitably from these conditions that the societies are- conducted primarily in the interests of the agents, and that the welfare of the members takes only a subordinate place. This is the evident explanation of the high rates of commission and other perquisites obtained by the agents of the large collecting societies.22. The policies issued by the companies are invariably granted without the right to participate in profits. In the case of the Prudential, however, the company appears to have waived its full rights in this respect, and up to 1915, under the Articles of Association, the policy-holders were granted two-thirds of the surplus remaining after the shareholders had been paid a dividend of 50 per cent., free of income tax, the bulk of which was taken from the surplus of the Industrial Branch. Thus, in the year 1914, the policy-holders in the Industrial Branch received 400,000Z. out of the profits, while - the shareholders received 600,0001., of which 120,0001. only came from the profits of the Ordinary Branch. Since 1915 the policy-holders have received nothing owing to the reduction of profits resulting from war claims. The dividend to the shareholders has been nominally reduced to 400,0001. a year, but as the dividend is paid free of income tax which, in the meantime, has grown to 6s. in the  .
the real dividend to the shareholders has remained practically unchanged throughout the war, although the policy-holders have been deprived of bonus altogether.The custom of this company has been to divide the policy-holders&apos; bonus among those policies which have become claims during the year, the right of a policy-holder to bonus thus depending entirely on the profits made by the company in the year preceding that in which his policy becomes a claim. It is a somewhat unfortunate fact, of which much evidence has been . produced to the Committee, that by printed slips attached to the policies or by pencilled entries made upon the policies themselves, the company&apos;s superintendents and agents have notified the bonus to great numbers of existing policy-holders as though it were an actually vested addition to their policies and not, as it actually is, a sum becoming due for payment only in the event of the death of the assured, or the maturity of the policy otherwise, during the year to which the bonus relates.In the case of a few other companies, tentative steps towards setting up a bonus system for the policy-holders on the lines of the Prudential appear to have been taken before the war, and certain small sums were paid in bonus on industrial policies by the Britannic Assurance Company, Limited, and the Wesleyan and General Assurance Society. With the war, however, these bonuses disappeared, although, in the case of the proprietary companies, the dividends to shareholders, while reduced, never fell below a substantial figure. The Salvation Army Company has given bonuses to a very small extent to certain industrial policies issued under an obsolete prospectus prior to 1903.In the case of the other companies, no attempt has been made to give policy-holders a share of profits, although in one case (Pearl) it is claimed that certain additions made to policies in 1906 and 1907 under a general revision of the tables were in the nature of a bonus distribution.The case of the collecting societies is somewhat different. These societies are governed by rules which appear, in the larger cases, to provide for allocations of surplus among the members, and considerable sums appear to have been distributed in this way by the Royal Liver, Liverpool Victoria and Royal London. The last-named society has now become a mutual company, and it is stated that no profits have been allocated to industrial policy-holders during the last 10 years.23. The difference between the apparent cost of conducting &quot;ordinary &quot; and &quot;industrial&quot; business respectively is very marked, and there is reason to believe that, in the cases of the Prudential and the Refuge, a portion of the expenses of administering the ordinary business is charged to the industrial branch, thus subsidising the ordinary &quot; with-profit&quot; policy-holder at the expense of the contributors under industrial policies. Apart from commission the charge made upon the premiums for expenses has been, in the case of the Prudential, from 13 to 14 per cent, in the industrial branch, and 2\ per cent. (31 per cent, in 1918) in the ordinary branch. The Refuge has similarly spent in management over 21 per cent, of the premiums in the industrial branch and 2-f per cent, in the ordinary branch. These companies do not admit that the industrial branches are overcharged to the relief of the ordinary policy-holders, but considering the small amount of the average policy in the ordinary branch and the frequency of the premium payments, many of which appear to be quarterly j the Committee are not satisfied that the business of the ordinary branch can be conducted on the proportion of the premiums charged against it.24. Industrial policies generally carry no right to surrender value or a free-paid-up policy upon lapse. In the case of the Prudential it is stated to be the general practice of the company to grant free-paid-up policies after premiums have been paid for five years provided that the life assured has attained the age of 15, and under these arrangements free ]policies have, it would seem, been regularly granted where applied for. In one other case, the Aberdeen and Northern Friendly Society, the rules provide for the grant of free policies under similar conditions, and certain other collecting societies have discretionary powers in this respect. But, in the main, and subject to the exceptions mentioned, the policy-holders of industrial companies and collecting societies forfeit all their interest in their assurances upon lapse.25. The industrial assurance system lends itself to abuse in many directions. Men with no command of capital find their opportunity in the lax. provisions of the Friendly Societies Act, which enable any seven persons, whatever their character or their credit, to join together in the formation of a collecting society which, upon its registry (as to which the Registrar has practically no discretion), may begin to collect premiums, and to spend them as fast as they are collected, with very little prospect of being&apos; able to meet claims as they arise. From the evidence received it is evident that, despite the vigilance oE the Registrar, the public is defenceless against the.machinations of any group of adventurers who have neither money nor reputation to lose and whose single purpose is to exploit the system for their own benefit. As. regards the formation of new companies, the position is less unsatisfactory to this extent, that, before the promoters of a new enterprise can begin business, they must raise capital, 20,0002. of which must be deposited with the Paymaster-General, under the statute, as security for the policy-holders.   But even as regards new companies, there are cases of gross and recklessO  10664 c
.6BOARD OF TRADE INDUSTRIAL LIFE ASSURANCE COMMITTEE:extravagance, carried on under the forms of the law, in which the Board of Trade has found itself helpless to give adequate protection to the insuring public.26. Apart from this particular class of cases the Committee find many examples of repre-hensible extravagance. Further, and largely as the result of this waste of premiums, many companies have found themselves, after a longer or shorter period, involved financially beyond redemption. Numerous amalgamations or transfers of engagements have followed, most of which have involved improvident and, in some cases, reckless bargains by the transferee companies.A recent case in which the safeguards on transfer of business imposed by the Act of 1909 appear to have been completely evaded has been brought to the notice of the Committee. The transfer appears to hav  been carried through without disclosure of the essential facts to the policy-holders of the companies concerned and without application for the sanction of the court. The holders of the policies in one of the companies were approached individually and induced to give up their old policies, receiving, in exchange, policies in the new company. The liabilities of the one company were thus extinguished and the other company bought all its shares and is proceeding to liquidate it, by which means it will obtain possession of its assets. The transfer was one of considerable magnitude and appears to have involved the purchasing company in a large expenditure, apart from the cost of the shares, and there are other unsatisfactory features about the case which, for the protection of the policy-holders, was pre-eminently one requiring a full disclosure of all the facts for the consideration of the court.27. Having in view the large proportion of the premiums applied to current expenditure the sufficiency of the reserves accumulated by the companies to meet their growing liabilities becomes a question of great importance. The Assurance Companies Act, 1909, and, in the case of collecting societies, the Friendly Societies Act, prescribes a periodical valuation, but lays down no conditions on which the valuation is to be conducted, the offices having in this respect unfettered freedom so far, at any rate, as the statutes are concerned. Where there are wide divergencies in the rates of premium for corresponding benefits, or where the policy conditions differ in fundamental particulars, there is possibly room for difference of actuarial opinion as to the proper value to be placed upon the liabilities. But these conditions do not arise to any material extent in the case of industrial assurance. The business of all the companies is practically identical, their tables of rates are strikingly similar to one another, and the adoption by all of an identical method of valuing the liabilities might reasonably be expected. So far, however, is this from being the case that among the 19 companies (counting the London, Edinburgh and Glasgow Fund of the Pearl as a separate company) 18 different ways are found in which the liabilities are actuarially measured. In the case of the Prudential, which accounts for about 40 per cent, of all the premiums collected by the industrial group, a&apos; comparatively strong basis of valuation was adopted many years ago and has been rigidly adhered to. The criticisms of the Committee upon this aspect of the business do not apply to that company nor to a few others, which have been steadily improving their valuation standards. But in several cases the basis is thoroughly unsatisfactory. In the worst case which came before the Committee the recently effected policies, instead of being treated as involving the company in liability, were brought in as assets, credit being taken, as for a secured asset, for a large excess in the value of the future premiums over the value of the sums assured, although the policy holders ha^e the option to lapse at any time. In this case, too, the funds brought into the valuation balance-sheet against the liabilities exceeded the real assets by many thousands of pounds, the difference being represented by the wholly fictitious item of &quot;organisation and extension expenses,&quot; i.e., money spent in the past which the company affects to believe can in some way be recovered for the policy-holders when the need to resort to it arises.The differences between the respective bases of valuation are the more unfortunate in that they appear to have misled the agents into thinking that certain companies place to reserve a greater part of the premiums than the liabilities require. In the evidence tendered to the Committee, it was submitted that the reserves should be lessened in order that the remuneration of the agents might be increased.28. The Committee have, in the foregoing paragraphs, endeavoured, as briefly as possible, to depict the nature and the ramifications of the business of industrial assurance as these have been unfolded in the course of their enquiry, or have emerged from their examina-tion of the valuable returns submitted to the departments concerned under the requirements of the Assurance Companies Act and the Friendly Societies Act. It is evident that, in the public interest, there is need for many reforms tmd for increased control. The need is urgent, and, in the view of the Committee, legislation should be undertaken without delay.29. The Committee accordingly submit a series of recommendations as to matters in which they think amendment of the law is necessary. Apart from defects of the system for Avhich remedies should be found it is essential to diminish, as far as possible, the risk and cost of litigation and some of the proposals have been framed with that object. There can&apos; be no doubt that in the case of disputed claims or litigation, either with companies or societies, the persons assured stand at a considerable disadvantage.
Complaints of Policy-holders.30. Numerous complaints were made of the methods in which the companies and societies carried on their business. These complaints were examined in detail by the Committee and recommendations under various heads are made in reference thereto.In addition to cases of individual hardship which were brought before the Committee by various witnesses, Mr. W. E. Mashford, of Hull, presented a series of typical cases drawn from a long experience in investigating complaints made to him by the assured, especially in the Hull district. The Committee are indebted to Mr. Mashford for his valuable assistance in this direction. While the Committee were not equally impressed by all the cases brought forward, they are satisfied that if Hull is a typical urban centre in regard to industrial assurance the volume of well-founded grievances under which the assured are labouring throughout the country must be serious.The Post Office Insurance System.31. The Committee had before them evidence as to the Post Office Insurance System. Under this system life assurance may be effected with Government security at any Post Office transacting savings bank business. Premiums may be paid weekly through the machinery of stamps affixed to premium books, handed in quarterly. The average charge for expenses is very low and the terms of assurance ought to be so much better, in consequence, than those afforded by the companies as to attract a large number of proposers, despite, the fact that the Post Office neither canvasses nor collects the premiums at the policy-holder&apos;s door.It is found, however, that the number of persons who effect assurances through the Post Office is extremely small, and the system as it is now administered can only be described as a failure.For this there are various reasons. In so far as the Post Office is not competitive and does no canvassing, it must always be at a great disadvantage, but, apart from this, the Committee think that the system is not operated with sufficient vigour or with due regard to what the public requires. For example, the Committee find that, although the cost of administration is so small, the sums assured do not compare to marked advantage at any age with those offered by the companies. The chief explanation is, apparently, that the premiums under the Post Office plan cease to be payable at 60 years of age, whereas under the ordinary system they continue for the whole duration of life or, in certain cases, to the age of 75. The Post Office system is possibly the better one, as the official witnesses suggested, but the question is whether the system should offer what the public requires or what is thought to be more suitable to the public needs. In the view of the Committee there can be no doubt as to the practical answer to this question. The proposer for assurance looks to the rate of premium and the sum assured, and the question whether, assuming that he survives, he is to pay for 40 years or for 50 is not in his mind and would receive little weight if it were suggested to him.In some other respects the conditions of the Post Office system seem open to criticism. The Committee are satisfied, therefore, that, if this system is to be maintained, it should be subjected to expert examination in all its aspects and so remodelled as to afford the prospect of attracting those persons who, if the opportunity were given them, would be prepared to surrender the convenience of paying premiums to a collector for the advantage of a substantial addition to their policies.Nationalisation of Industrial Assurance.32. The question of Nationalisation of Industrial Assurance was not brought prominently to the notice of the Committee. There are two possible courses in this direction the transfer of the Avhole organisation of Industrial Assurance to the State, or the provision of burial benefits through the medium of the National Health Insurance system. As to the first of these there are obvious difficulties, and as the system is constituted it does not appear to the Committee that the State could properly undertake its administration. It might be practicable to pro-pose a funeral benefit to be administered under the National Health Insurance system, but this would necessitate that it should be placed on a compulsory: basis.It is probable that between the Industrial Assurance business and the provision made for burial expenses in the &quot;funeral benefits &quot; provided by the non-collecting friendly societies the overwhelming majority of the working population are in this respect provided for. The conditions under which compulsory insurance against sickness and disablement was set up do not exist in this connection.Distribution of Profits.33. The Committee have been impressed by the contrast between thtf dividends paid to &apos; shareholders and the share in the profits which has been assigned to the policy-holders.  Ino 2
view of the nature of the business it is evident that the share capital of industrial assurance companies exercises much less important functions than that of commercial or manufacturing undertakings, and this is especially the case where there is no contingent liability for uncalled capital. In these circumstances the case for high dividends appears to the Committee to rest upon somewhat slender foundations, and they think that, in general, the policy-holders should receive a substantially greater part of the profits than is accorded to them at the present time. They express the hope that this indication of their opinion may be of service to the companies, with whom the decision rests. They are further of opinion that the method of distributing surplus among industrial policy-holders should be reconsidered. The system adopted by the Prudential, and the misunderstandings to which it gives rise, have already been described (par. 22).Control.34. The present arrangement under which the companies carrying on the business of Industrial Assurance make returns to the Board of Trade, while the collecting societies are registered by, and make returns to, the Chief Registrar, is not satisfactory.The same business is carried on by both types of organisation and, in practice, the control by members in the case of the societies is illusory. Both companies and societies should be under one department in respect of Industrial Assurance.35. The question of the constitution and the scope of this authority is not free from difficulty. The large collecting societies are subject to the Friendly Societies Act, under which they are registered, and it is certainly not expedient that the supervision of their activities should be withdrawn from the office which is charged with the administration of that Act. The Companies which transact Industrial Assurance business also issue &quot; ordinary &quot; policies, under which the premiums are payable at annual, half-yearly, and quarterly intervals, and it is equally difficult to suggest that this latter business should be detached from the Board of Trade which supervises the offices doing Ordinary Assurance business. The Committee think that, on the whole, the best course will be to vest the supervision and control of all industrial assurance business, whether conducted by companies or societies, in the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies. The extent to which the Board of Trade and the Chief Registrar should respectively have control, in regard to the rare questions affecting the capital account of a company doing both ordinary and industrial business, is a matter for consideration, but it should not, in the view of the Committee, present material difficulty in giving effect to their recommendation.36. To facilitate this transfer of functions and, incidentally, to deal with other defects, the Committee recommend that (a) the ordinary and industrial branches of the business of a company shall be separateclasses for the purpose of section 1 of the Assurance Companies Act, 1909 ; (6) the assets of the industrial life &quot;assurance and annuity fund shall be shown separately from the other assets of the company in the Third Schedule to the Act; and (c) where the expenses have been apportioned between the ordinary and industrialbranches the auditors shall be required to certify the accuracy of the appor-tionment. -37. The definition of an Industrial Assurance Company supplied by the Collecting Societies! and Industrial Assurance Companies Act, 1896, namely, &quot;Companies granting &quot; assurances on any one life for a less sum than 201., and receiving premiums by means of &quot; collectors at a greater distance than 10 miles from the principal place of business at less &quot; periodical intervals than two months &quot; is sufficiently wide to indicate the companies which would come under the supervision of the controlling authority proposed, but is not wide enough to include all the policies to which the term &quot;industrial&quot; should be applied and the protection of which the subjoined recommendations are designed to secure. The Committee propose, therefore, that the limit of 201. shall be removed from the definition of an Industrial Assurance Company, and that an industrial policy should include every policy on which the premiums are collected by means of collectors at less periodical intervals than two months.38. The controlling authority should have greater powers of supervision and control than are, or can be, exercised at the present time. To ensure this control, and that the business of companies and societies may be carried on with due provision for protection of the assured, the Committee recommend the following amendments &quot;of (i) the Collecting Societies and Industrial Assurance Companies Act, 1896, and (ii) the Assurance Companies Act, 1909, and (iiij additional legislation.39. Amendments of the Collecting Societies and Industrial-AssuranceCompanies Act, 1896.Section 1. Limits of Collection.&apos; &quot;Ten miles &quot; should be reduced to &quot; five miles &quot; or even less in the case of the County of London, and possibly some other large cities;  It would be possible within the 10-mile
limit to run. a large company or society of the nature of a collecting society or industrial assurance company without being subject to the restrictions imposed by the Act.Section 2.- Copies of Rules.It should be made clear that a proper copy of the rules, with all the amendments up to date, must be delivered free to the member, in addition to the policy; and it should be provided that additional copies of the rules must be supplied to a member or any person interested, or claiming to be interested, in the funds of the society, at a reasonable price.Section 3. Lapse Notices. These notices should be in a statutory form.The present provision that &quot; a reasonable time not being less than 14 days&quot; be allowed by the forfeiture notice for the payment of arrears should be extended to a definite period of one month.Section 4. Consent to Transfer.There should be a statutory form of consent to transfer setting out the terms of the 3nember&apos;s existing policy, and the terms of the policy to which he will become entitled on transfer, and what consideration, if any, has been paid for the transfer, and to whom, and it should be witnessed by a magistrate whose duty it should be to see that the transferring member understands the transaction. The notice to the body from which he is transferred should also be in statutory form, giving full particulars of the member&apos;s name and address -and the number of his policy.Section 6 (2). Audit.The provisions as to &quot;carrying on publicly the business of an accountant&quot; gives no adequate protection.   &quot; A public auditor &quot; should be substituted.Section 7.(i) A provision should be added giving the persons mentioned in this section, in addition to their other remedies, power, in cases not exceeding 251., in Avhich there is no question of legality of the policy and no charge of fraud or misrepresentation, to apply to the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies, who should then deal with the dispute as if it had been referred by consent under Section 08 of the Friendly Societies Act, 1896, except that the consent of the Treasury should not be necessary. The Chief Registrar should have power to entertain any case of any nature, without limit of amount, on the consent of both parties.(ii) It was held in London, Edinburgh and Glasgow Assurance Co. v. Partington, 88 L.T. 732, that a person who was claiming the return of premiums on a void policy was not within, this section, as he Avas not a &quot; person insured.&quot; The section should be further amended, therefore, by adding after the words &quot; through a member or person insured&quot; the words &quot;or under or in respect of any policy,&quot; and also by adding after the words &quot; or under the rules &quot; the words &quot; or any person aggrieved who has ceased to be a member or any person claiming through such person aggrieved &quot; (as in Section 68 of the Friendly Societies Act, 1896), so as to cover past members who seek reinstatement or some other form of remedy.(iii) Provision should be made that, in disputes as to industrial assurance being brought before a court of summary jurisdiction, the court should have power to award costs.(iv) It should be provided, further, that policy-holders or their legal representatives should be able to sue the company or society in the proper courts in the district where the premiums are paid without any deposit being required for costs.Section 8 (c). Collectors at Meetings.This subsection should be amended so as to prohibit collectors or superintendents from being present at meetings. .;Section 14. Offences.This section only selects certain things which are ordered or forbidden to be done by the Act, and&apos;there is no sanction to enforce the remainder.It should be replaced by a section in general terms, such as Section 84 (a) and (6) of the Friendly Societies Act, 1896.JO. Amendments op the Assurance Companies Act, 1909.(i) Sections 1 and 2, Deposit of 20,0002. Collecting societies, as well as. Industrial Assurance Companies, should be under obligation to deposit 20,0002. with the Paymaster-General. This should apply to unregistered as well as registered societies-in the case of societies which do not apply for registration, before beginning business; in the case of societies which apply for registration, before registration.
This provision should be made to apply to existing societies as well as future societies.: Existing societies, whether registered or unregistered, should, be given 12 months to make the deposit. If any society should fail to do so, the Chief Registrar should have power to order it to be dissolved and its assets appropriated by the procedure laid down in Section 80 of the Friendly Societies Act, 1896.(ii) Section 2 of the Assurance Companies Act, 1909, provides that every life assurance company shall deposit, and keep deposited, with the Paymaster-General the sum of 20,0001. The purpose of this initial deposit is not so much to provide security for the due fulfilment of a ccmpany&apos;s liability as to prevent the registration of unsound concerns. Before the deposit can be made the Board of Trade have to issue their warrant and the Committee understand that the Board has been advised that they have no discretion in dealing with a company&apos;s application for a warrant. This limitation upon the discretion of the Board of Trade has proved unsatisfactory in practice since the Board has been unable to prevent the extension to life assurance of the powers of companies whose previous record showed such extension to be undesirable. The Committee recommend that the Act should be amended to empower the controlling authority to appear in court, in a case of this kind, and oppose the company&apos;s petition for leave to transact life assurance business.(iii) Section 36 (3). The Committee are of opinion that these words cover illegal policies but, as a doubt has been expressed, the matter should be made plain.Lapses.41. Tile matter which is the most frequent subject of complaint in regard to Industrial Assurance business is the excessive number of lapsed policies. It is commonly believed that large profits are made by the companies out of lapses, while, on the other hand, the companies allege that the great mass of lapses occur among policies of very short duration, and that these have not been long enough in force to compensate the companies for the heavy cost of putting them on the books. It is said, in fact, that, on the whole, lapses are a source of loss rather than of profit.The evidence shows that a very large proportion of all the policies taken out lapse within the first three or four years of their duration ; the bulk of them within the first few months. Even without the heavy procuration expenses paid to their agents, on which the companies mainly base their case, the amount of profit on these lapses would be small. The ordinary expenses and cost of collection would be incurred in any event, and the companies would be at the risk of paying the sum assured or part of it in the event of death during the time the assurance was in force. What would be left would not represent more than a quarter or a third of the premiums paid. The average premium on whole-life assurances is about 2d. a week, and assuming that the average period for which premiums have been paid in the cases of these early lapses is a year (which is certainly a full average) the average amount in hand at the date of lapse, even if no procuration expenses have been charged against the policy, could hardly amount to more than 2s. Qd. Therefore if, apart from the payment of procuration fees, the aggregate profit from lapses be regarded as considerable, the average profit per case is very small, and its disposal in the interest of the person from whose contributions it has come could not result in any substantial benefit to him.The offices, however, argue that they have to pay to the agent as procuration fees all the premiums he collects for the first 10 to 20 weeks of the life of the policy, and that if it then drops the agent has had all the premiums, and there is nothing to help to pay the superin-tendency and head office expenses in connection with the issue of the policy. The offices further say, in effect, that if the policy lasts a year the agent has been paid his collecting commission as well as the procuration fee, and, in addition, they have had to pay head office and branch office expenses in respect of the issue of the policy, accounting, &amp;c, while they have had the risk of the policy becoming a claim, so that even at the end of the year there remains in hand little or nothing out of the premiums paid on the policy.. They thus arrive at the conclusion that, on the whole, they lose money by lapses.This line of argument seems to imply that all the expense relative to &quot; new business &quot; arises out of the particular policies which the agent succeeds in getting. That is to say, he is supposed to earn nothing, and the companies to incur no expense, over the people whom he importunes in vain, the whole of his exertions being regarded as concentrated upon those with whom he succeeds.It seems questionable whether such an argument is maintainable; but, whoever gets the benefit of the premiums paid, whether the companies or their agents, it is certain that the public loses heavily by lapses.The Prudential accounts alone will give some indication of the amount involved. In 1916, the payments of this Company to the agents were 2,346,639/., of- which 643,030/. was for new business. Of that new business, it is safe to say that a large percentage has already disappeared, and that more will go. The opinion may be hazarded that, so far as the assured are concerned, the greater part of the sum above named was paid by the public for no appreciable benefit.  The new business experience of 1916 was in no way exceptional.  The amount paid
&quot;by the Prudential to agents as new business commission since 1913 has averaged over 700,()00 , a year. This sum has come wholly out of the premiums paid by the public, and although in recent years, probably for special reasons, the rate of lapse has declined, the Committee do not hesitate to say that, for a great proportion of the sum so paid, no benefit to the public has accrued or ever will accrue.42. It has been already indicated that even without the debit to the new policies of the doubtful item of procuration expenses, no effective return could be made to policy-holders who discontinue payment within a short time of becoming insured. It thus becomes important to consider whether the loss incident to the early lapsing of policies can be effectively reduced. On this point the Committee are satisfied that so long as procuration fees are paid for new business, it will be to the interest of agents to attach undue importance to this side of their activities, looking only to the amount of the new business they can get instead of to its value to the assured and the likelihood of its permanence, and the present waste and loss will continue.They are of opinion, therefore, that the end in view can only be reached by the abolition of procuration fees, and recommend the prohibition of the payment to agents of procuration fees for new business, and the substitution of a minimum weekly wage, based on a fixed collection per week, with a commission on all sums collected above that amount.43. The further problem arises, in respect of lapses, of the treatment of policy-holders who are compelled to discontinue their payments after making contributions for long periods. i\t present such people have no enforceable claim against the companies and frequently suffer serious loss in consequence. They have doubtless been unwise to enter into such oppressive contracts, but against this it can be said, with force, that the contract was made between&apos; two parties of very unequal position. On the one side was the company and its agent, fully informed, looking for profit and eager to issue the policy ; on the other side was the prospective assured, ignorant, as a rule, of business and unable to realise the need to scrutinise the contract pressed upon him (or more often, her).The Committee are satisfied that from such conditions great hardship has resulted in some cases. They appreciate the objections which have been raised to the indiscriminate promise of cash surrender values on small policies, and they recognise the fairness with which certain companies and societies endeavour to meet the difficulty by undertaking to allow free paid-up policies. They consider, however, that more than this is necessary, and particularly that the matter can no longer be left to the voluntary action of the companies. They accordingly recommend the compulsory issue of free paid-up policies, coupled with a provision requiring the companies to pay surrender values in respect of such policies in certain cases.   The detailed proposals giving effect to this recommendation are as follows: (i) Every policy-holder of 15 years of age and upwards whose policy has been in force for five years and upwards shall be entitled, on discontinuance of the premium, to a free paid-up policy, or in the case of a^ policy-holder going abroad, or in other special circumstances, to a surrender value on application within one year from the date to which the last premium paid relates; and every lapse notice shall be required to state clearly the rights of the policy-holder in this respect.(ii) The value of an existing policy shall be ascertained in accordance with the rule forvaluing a policy contained in the Sixth Schedule to the Assurance Companies Act, 1909, with necessary modifications to enable the rate of interest and the table of mortality to be employed to be prescribed by the controlling authority ; and 80 per cent, of the value so obtained shall be applied, as the case may require, to the surrender value or the free paid-up policy,. the latter to be calculated upon a formula prescribed by the authority.A special difficulty arises in regard to the immediate application of these recommenda-tions. The grant of surrender values premises that proper reserves have been accumulated, but there are cases, as has been previously indicated, in which expenditure has been excessive and the accumulation of funds correlatively small. The new provisions as to surrender values will eventually compel the accumulation of proper reserves in all cases, but this cannot be achieved at once, and the Committee therefore recommend that these proposals should not become operative until the end of five years from their enactment,44. War Bond Policies-The Committee are of opinion that special provision is required in the case of this class of policy for the protection of the assured, who, in many cases, have entered into obligations which it is beyond their power to fulfil. They recommend that, in the case of these policies, the controlling authority should be empowered, on the application of the assured, to revise the conditions of the policies as to lapse and surrender where these appear to act inequitably to the assured, regard being had to the legitimate interests of the companies.45. Proposals for Insurance.Numerous complaints were brought before the Committee that proposals for insurance had been improperly filled up by agents, either in terms which the assured did not understand or with insufficient inquiry as to the accuracy of the statements made.0 4
Having regard to the nature of the business of industrial assurance, the Committee do Dot consider it to be practicable to prohibit agents from filling up proposals for assurance; but it is essential that further protection should be provided, and to ensure this the Committee recommend (1) That there should be a statutory form of proposal, and that the use of any other than this statutory form, either by a company or society or an agent, should be made subject to a penalty.(2) If a proposal in statutory form is filled up by an agent (a) that the agent must in all cases be regarded as an agent for the company or society and not for the proposer, so as to make a company or society liable where*the statutory form is filled up by one of their agents.On this point the law as stated in Biggar v. Rock Life Assurance Company, [1902], 1 K.B. 516, should be altered so far as industrial assurance is concerned. It would follow from this recommendation that special canvassers should not be allowed. To ensure this, it should be made an offence, punishable by penalty, for a company or society to canvass for new business through a person not regularly in its employment, or for the agent to engage the services of such a person to act in that &quot;capacity, or for any person to purport to act in such capacity without authority.(b) that, except in the case of a fraudulent statement in a material particular on the part of the proposer, it should not be open to a company or society to question the validity of an insurance policy founded on a statutory proposal filled up by one of their agents subject to the following reservations, viz. :  (i) That where a mistake has been made as to age, the&apos; company or society shall be enabled to adjust the terms of the policy in order to make them applicable in the same way as if the correct age had originally been inserted.(ii) That in regard to points involving the state of health of the assured at the date of the proposal, it shall be open to the company or society to question the accuracy of the statement during two years from the date of the policy.(3) If one of the conditions of the proposal is that the proposer has not already any policy in the company or society, it should be the duty of the company or society to see that this condition is carried out, and if, in fact, more than one policy is issued, the company or society should pay on all the policies (see Marcoviteh v. Liverpool Victoria Friendly Society, 28 T. L.R. 188).The Committee further recommend, as regards future policies other than those for funeral expenses provided for by section 36 (1) of the Act of 1909: (i) That the proposal form be required to contain a declaration by the person whose lifeis assured that the policy is taken out by himself and that the premiums are to be paid by him;(ii) That it be made an offence under penalty for an agent of a company knowingly toassist in effecting any policy without insurable interest.46. Policies Standard Forms.It was suggested in the hearing before the Committee that all policies should be issued in a standard statutory form in order to give in a simple and accurate manner such information as might enable the assured to understand the terms of his contract. The Committee recommend (i) .That there should be standard forms of policy for companies and societies respectively,containing all the necessary clauses, with variations permitted only in the actual financial terms of the insurance, and that the use of any other than the standard forms by a company, society, or agent should be prohibited under penalty.(ii) That the standard forms should embody all the provisions of the law relating to companies and societies which it is material that the policy-holder should know; that the provisions regarding lapse should be printed in some particularly dis-tinctive way; and that they should show that policy-holders have the right of recourse either to the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies, or to the county court, or to a court of summary jurisdiction.47. Valuation.The Committee find that further safeguards are required in order to ensure an effective system of sound valuation in the case of industrial assurance. It would be difficult for any Government department to assume responsibility for the valuations of industrial assurance companies, but there should be greater powers than the Board of Trade at present possess and more effective criticism than the Board is now able to make.
The Committee recommend that (ij the basis of valuation adopted by a company or a society shall be such as to .secure that every policy is treated as a liability, and that in arriving at such liability an adequate provision is made for future expenses of management (including commission);(ii) no valuation to be made at any time after seven years from the passing of the Actshall represent the estimated liability of a company or society under its contracts at an amount smaller than would be shown by a valuation made upon a basis to be prescribed by the controlling authority;(iii) no part of the assets of the life assurance and annuity funds brought into the valuation balance sheet shall be such as is represented by organisation or extension expenses, or purchase of business, or goodwill;(iv) the controlling authority be empowered to require from the industrial companies and societies such information as to the baois of valuation, supplementing the schedules to the Act of 1909 and section 28 of the Friendly Societies Act as it may deem requisite;(v) the authority be empowered to reject any valuation which is not in conformity withthe conditions above laid down;(vi) if the valuation brings out a deficiency, the authority be empowered to apply tothe court for a winding-up order if, after investigation, it is satisfied that the existence of the company should be terminated ;(vii) the controlling authority be required periodically to submit to Parliament a reportof its proceedings, containing such comment upon the valuations received as it may deem the circumstances to require.A further point as to the valuation arises in those cases where debentures and loans have been issued and charged, either presently or contingently, upon the life assurance fund.The Committee recommend that where such a charge exists the company shall be required to draw attention to it by a note to the valuation balance sheet giving the particulars, and stating that the result shown by the valuation is subject to the liability in respect of the charge.The Committee recommend further that no company be permitted hereafter to charge its life assurance fund as security for debt.48. Transfer of Engagements of Collecting Societies.The evidence the Committee have had upon this subject points to serious abuses in the case of collecting societies. Cases have been brought forward where the transferee society has paid large sums of money for distribution, in unknown proportions, among the officials of the transferor society. In some cases the amounts so distributed have palpably been out of proportion to any reasonable scale of compensation for loss of office, and, in certain of these cases, the benefits obtained by the members of the transferor society have been much less than the assets transferred should have secured for them. There is evidence, on the other hand, of transfers of collecting societies known to be insolvent the transfer of which involved the members of the transferee society in a serious burden.There appears to be no way of stopping these transfers without legislation.The Committee recommend (i) that, where an amalgamation or transfer of engagements of a collecting society is proposed, the members whose assents are required shall have placed before them a full statement, not only of the money to be paid in consideration of the transfer, but of the manner in which the sum so paid is to be distributed, and the exact share therein which is to be paid to each participant;. (ii) that, on the statutory assents being obtained, the controlling authority shall review the whole transaction with regard to the financial position of each society concerned, and shall, be empowered to require such amendments in the scheme as, in the circumstances, may seem just and equitable. Members who are unable through ignorance to safeguard their own interests should in this way be protected.It may be added that the first of these proposals is closely correspondent with the conditions of transfer of engagements imposed in the case of companies by the Assurance Companies Act, 1909.49. Transfers of Engagements of Companies.Transfers of engagements in the case of companies are regulated by section 13 of the Assurance Companies Act, 1909.   The investigations made by the Committee show that
this section requires strengthening in material particulars in the case of Industrial Assurance Companies, aud the following recommendations are made : (a) that the controlling authority should have a statutory right to be heard upon the petition, see subsection (2). (I)) that the &quot; independent actuary &quot; (subsection 3 (b)) whose report is to be obtainedshould be appointed by the controlling authority, and should make his report tothe authority, which should communicate it to the parties.(c) that the section should be strengthened to secure that every case in which the liabilities of one company are assumed by another should be treated as a transfer of business, for the purpose of the section ;(d) that suitable provision in conformity with these recommendations should be made toregulate any transfer of engagements between a collecting society and an industrial assurance company.50. Courts (Emergency Powers) Act, 1914.The question which arises under this Act is a complicated one. Suggestions for dealing with the problem were supplied to the Committee by the Prudential Company and by the Association of Industrial Assurance Companies and Collecting Friendly Societies. The Committee desire to express their&apos; obligation to the company, and the association for the assistance which they have given. In the recent case of Barkery. Phillips, 122 L.T.R. 122, it was held that Section 1 (1) of the Act only applied where a company or society was taking steps to enforce a lapse and that it did not apply where an assured person was taking proceedings for payment under an assurance. The Committee recommend that this decision should be met by legislation, and that it should be provided that where a claim arises while the Act is in force the companjtf or society shall be liable to pay the claims less the arrears of premium. The general practice of the companies and societies appears to have been in accord with the above proposal.When the Act corpes to an end the Committee recommend, as a fair way of meeting the difficulties which must arise, that policies subject to the Act shall be kept in force for six months after the Act has ceased to operate and that the companies shall be under obligation to notify every policy-holder to whom the Act applies his right to secure the maintenance of the policy by payment of the arrears, the amount of which should be stated on the notice. Alternatively, the companies should give the option to the policy-holder of maintaining the policy in force for a reduced amount, or in the case of an endowment assurance for an extended period, subject to the cancellation of the arrears, on the terms of a scheme to be approved by the controlling authority.Recommendations on Minor Points.51. Illegal Insurances. The Committee recommend that if such a policy has been taken out and the fact is discovered, the company or society should repay a percentage of the premiums equal to the amount of the surrender value, unless it can be shown that there has been wilful misstatement in a material particular on the part of the proposer.52. Payment of Claims. Where liability to pay a claim is not in dispute, the full amount of any claim should be paid to the person entitled thereto without any deduction whatever, save for arrears of premiums on the policy in respect of which the claim is paid.53. Substitution of Policies. Where a policy-holder agrees or is persuaded to substitute a new policy for an existing one, he should be handed an account certified by. the head office of what he is entitled to receive on the surrender of his former policy, and of what he is entitled to under his new policy, and also a new policy and a new collecting book.54. Registration of Names of Secretary and Members of the Committee of Management.  The Committee recommend that, as in the case of trustees under section 25 (3) of the Friendly Societies Act, 1896, and the Friendly Societies Regulations, Regulation 10, the society should send to the Registrar a-copy of every resolution appointing a secretary or a member of the committee of management, signed by the person so appointed and by the secretary, or, in the case of an appointment of a secretary, by the trustees, within 14 days after the date of the meeting at which such resolution was passed.55. Annual Accounts and Returns. The Committee recommend that the controlling authority should have poAver to reject any annual account or return and to insist on any alterations that it may think lit before acceptance. It should have power to order the inspec-tion of the books and documents of the company or society by a chartered or incorporated accountant, and, on his report, to require the variation of the annual account or return, or the substitution of a new one.56. Inspection. At present the Chief Registrar can only inspect on the application of a proportion of the members under section 76 of the Friendly Societies Act, 1896, and the Board of Trade has no effective power of inspection. Moreover, the Chief Registrar, when he has inspected, has no power of enforcing his requisitions. , ,
The Committee recommend that the controlling authority should, in the case of a society, to have power to inspect in a manner similar to that provided by section 70 whenever it thinks fit, and, after inspection, to cancel the registry and award the distribution of the funds under section 80, or take such other steps as it thinks proper to meet the situation. There ought to be cognate provisions in the case of a company, including the power to apply to the court for a winding-up order.57. Cheap Certificates.-The Committee recommend that sections 97 and 98(5) of the Friendly Societies Act, 1896, should be applied mutatis mutandis to industrial assurance companies, and that these provisions should be extended to marriage certificates in the case of both companies and societies.58. Inspection of Policies and Collecting books. Where a company or society takes possession of a policy or a collecting book for any purpose, it should be returned within not more than 14 days, unless the policy has come to an end by payment of the claim thereon, subject to penalty for default.59. Limitation of Time for Prosecution. At present, under the Summary Jurisdiction Acts, prosecutions have to take place within six months of the date of the offence. This makes prosecution, in particular for misapplication of funds, practically impossible in the case of collecting societies. Take, for example, a return for 1918. It is lodged on, or just before, May 31st, 1919. It then has to be examined and the matter investigated, which takes some time, and, if a misapplication is discovered, the date of the offence has to be laid as somewhere in 1918, since it is usually impossible to discover the exact date on which it is committed. Except, therefore, in the rare cases where an offence is discovered owing to a complaint within six months of the offence, no prosecution can be begun.The Committee recommend the adoption of the limitation provided by section 164 (2) of the Bankruptcy Act, 1914, substituting the controlling authority for the officers therein mentioned : &quot; Summary proceedings in respect of any offence shall not be instituted after one &quot; year from the first discovery thereof by the authority, nor, in any case, shall they be instituted after three years from the commission of the offence.&quot;60. Consolidation of the Law. The Committee recommend that the Collecting Societies Act, 1896, as amended, the portions of the Assurance Companies Act, 1909, which relate to industrial assurance, as amended, and the new proposed legislation, should be consolidated in one Act, so as to form a complete code.The Committee desire to express their sense of obligation to Mr. Walter J. Smith, of the Board of Trade, who&apos; has rendered valuable assistance as their Secretary.(Signed)     PARMOOR (Chairman).W. THEODORE CARR. H. S. CAUTLEY EVAN HAYWARD. JOHN HODGE.G.
