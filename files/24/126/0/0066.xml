This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,   j g secret.CP. 3161THE CABINET.INTERNMENT OP IRISH REBELS.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.With reference to my previous memoranda on the subject of the internment of -Irish rebels in tiiis country (CP. 3082 and 3082a), preliminary investigations, made -after consultation with the Home Office, have shown that accommodation can be found for approximately 2.600 internees, exclusive of guards, by utilizing the following empty prisons : Derby, Wakefield, Warwick, Reading, Devizes, Chelmsford and Lewes. The Home Office state that they are unable to release Portland for this purpose, as to do so would disorganize the prison administration. The figure 2,(500 can only be regarded as approximate; a detailed inspection of the above-mentioned prisons commences to-day,, and reports on the actual accommodation available, having regard to the military guards necessary and the works services required, will be received by me shortly. The Army will arrange maintenance, guarding and provision of equipment, &amp;c, for the internees to be accommodated in these prisons.As regards further accommodation, it is urged that the Admiralty should undertake a share of this work, and should provide for the accommodation, administration and custody of internees at Scapa, where it is understood thau there is hutted accommodation for 2,000, and also at Osea Island, near Maldon, where I am informed that the Admiralty have a hutted camp capable of accommodating 600, at present occupied, but due to be vacated immediately. The Air Force apparently have neither the personnel nor the organization required for the custody of internees at Scapa or elsewhere. It is suggested that the. movement of these internees from Ireland to Scapa and Osea Island should be undertaken by the Admiralty. In this connection, it must be remembered that the Army possesses in Great Britain no troops available for duties in connection with internees.L. W.-E.The War Office,20th July, 1921.
