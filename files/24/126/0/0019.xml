The Marines as well as the Air Force have to be taken into consideration in relation to both Navy and Army ; and it must not be overlooked that the movement of recent years in the direction of close scrutiny and assimilation of the relative emoluments of all these Services may give the matter great financial importance.Thus, since the re-settlement of the pay of the Services in 1919, Naval Officers-have been complaining, on the strength of the table of relative ranks, that they are already seriously underpaid as compared with Army Officers ; though, if the comparison is based on age, the contrary is the case. Indeed, among the Army Officers most closely associated with the Navy (those of the Garrison Artillery), owing to the present slowness of promotion, the Army Captain is likely to find his naval contemporaries, &apos;age for age and service for service, not Lieutenants according to the table, but Captains, R.N., ranking with Lieutenant-Colonels and Colonels in the Army.Again, apparently innocent changes&quot; within the Sea Service, made without consultation with the War Office, have produced the result that, for purposes of Widow&apos;s pension, a Major of Marines ranks with a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Army a position which to any Army Officer cannot but appear indefensible.I fully recognize that, since the original table of relative precedence between Army and Navy was drawn up, the increasing size, power and cost of battleships have affected the responsibilities of Captains, R.N.; but it is also true that under modern conditions in the Field an Army Lieutenant-Colonel (Battalion Commander) or Colonel (Brigade Commander) has a totally different measure of responsibility from that of the old days of hollow squares. \If, therefore, it be thought necessary that there should be a Cabinet enquiry, of which the results should be submitted to the King, I think it should be so constituted as to go fully into all the questions involved; and I would suggest a Committee with an &quot; independent&quot; Cabinet Minister in the chair, a &quot;service&quot; member from each of the three Departments, and a Treasury representative to keep an eye on possible consequences as regards emoluments.L. w.-E.the war office,qtjuly, 1921.
