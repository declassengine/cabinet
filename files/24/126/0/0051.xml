[This Document is the Property j)f HisJBritannic Majesty&apos;s Government. ]Printed for the use of the Cabinet.   July 1921.SECRET.CP. 3150.THE  CABINET.DUNDEE AND THE HOUSING SITUATION.Memorandum by the Secretary oe State eor the Colonies.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues the enclosed letter which I have received from the City Council of Dundee on the subject of the recent decisions upon housing. There is, of course, a strong Labour element on the Council, but there is a substantial majority of Conservatives and Liberals, and it certainly seems to me very remarkable that they should be unanimous on a matter of this kind. I fear that we put ourselves in a weak position in regard to these great local bodies when we give them such contradictory directions at such short intervals of time. In any case, I think the Cabinet ought to consider, without delay, what steps should be taken to prevent the actual waste of money which must arise when large areas have been prepared for building, at a heavy charge, and the building is suddenly arrested.I need scarcely say that 1 shall find it a matter of very great difficulty to offer any satisfactory explanation to the City Council of the violent reversal of policy into which we have been led.w. s. c.Colonial Office,July 20, 1921.The Right Hon. Winston S. Churchill, M.P., House of Commons, London.Dear Sir, City Chambers, Dundee, July 18, 1921.AT a meeting of the Town Council of Dundee held to-day, convened for the purpose of considering the decision of the Government not to sanction any further expenditure on the housing of the working-classes, it was unanimously decided, on the motion of our Lord Provost, to invite other large Local Authorities to co-operate in making the strongest possible protest against the present action of the Government.The convener of the Housing Committee at that meeting appropriately reminded the Council that under the Housing and Town Planning, &amp;c. (Scotland) Act of the 19th August, 1919, it became the duty of every Local Authority to consider the needs of their district with respect to the provision of houses for the working-classes, and that by section 3 of that Act it is declared.that, where an Authority failed to prepare and carry into execution a scheme, the Board of Health are themselves given full powers to prepare and carry out the scheme and to recover the whole cost from the Local Authority.This city, in obedience to the instructions of the Government and relying on their pledges, have acquired land for housing schemes at a cOst, including streets and sewers, of  170,000, and agricultural land extending to many acres which was formerly producing crops is now laid out with new streets and   standing waste waiting for a commencement with building.Gas, water and electricity mains have been laid at a cost of  30,000.A small portion of this outlay has been already expended and approved of, but unless new buildings are erected there will be work and land of the value of  160,000 lying unreinunerative.[6646]
The annual deficit on the unused portion of this capital expenditure will be approximately  10,000, and a sum equal to 2d, on the local rates. The whole of this capital expenditure has had the approval of the Scottish Board of Health.Dundee, at the commencement of the housing schemes, estimated that they required 6,000 houses, aud up to the present they have only completed or are completing 686 houses, leaving a deficiency of 5,31-1 still to be erected.In Dundee there exists a veritable house famine at the present time, and in support of that statement 1 should state that there are 655 houses overcrowded and 430 houses which accommodate 870 separate families.Not merely are there too few houses, but a considerable portion of the existing ones more particularly in congested areas-are so worn out, defective and insanitary, that mere repair will not render them reasonably fit for human habitation.The need for additional houses makes it much more difficult for the Local Authority to close unfit, houses or to clear the slum areas, and the proper policy would be to build sufficient new houses.In his annual report, our Chief Medical Officer declares that there is no question as to the insufficiency of houses in the city, and that the health of many of the citizens of Dundee is suffering from insufficiency and unsuitability of the houses.   -In addition to asking me to communicate with you, the Prime Minister, Sir Alfred Mond and the other Member of Parliament for Dundee, a deputation of the Council consisting of Mr. John Reid, the convener of the Housing Committee, Mr. S. G. Fraser, the convener of the Public Health Committee, and the City Engineer, have been appointed as a deputation to at once proceed to London, with a view of endeavouring to have a meeting with you and other Members of Parliament to get the above resolution given effect to if possible at the debate on the subject in the House of Commons on Thursday first.I trust that you will give this representation of my Council your serious consideration, and should the deputation of this Council call on you give them every assistance.Yours faithfully,Wm. H. BLYTH MARTIN,Toion Clerk.
