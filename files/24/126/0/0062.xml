Memorandum by the Chancellor of the ^chequer.BEER,1.      I desire strongly to support tho proposal of the President of the Board of Trade (CP.3125) that the control of retail beer prices should be abolished and all restrictions on beer gravities removed.2.      Both these controls sprang from the limitation on output imposed during the War in order to conserve foodstuffs.    Maximum prices were fixed so that exorbitant prices should not be charged for the limited supplies available and gravities were kept at a lew figure with the object of securing as large a bulk supply as possible from the standard barrelage allowed.3.      These considerations have long ceased to exist. Output is today only limited by demand arid competition may safely be regarded as an adequate safeguard against exorbitant prices, especially in these days of reduced spending power.    In fact, as the President of the Board of Trade points out, the present maximum prices tend, if anything, to keep up the price of beer against the consumer.   The cost of production is less now than when the present prices were fixod early in 1920, and the time most be approaching, if It has not actually arrived, when the prices of some kinds of beer should fall.    But complaints by the public as to high prices can now be met by the trade pointing to the schedule of Government prices (which are no doubt treated for the purposes as fixed and not as maximum prices) and there Is little probability of prices falling so long as the odium of maintaining them can be placed upon the Government.
4.    The argument In favour of restricting the average gravity of beer in order to make available supplies go as far as possible long since lost all validity.      The only reason for the maintenance of the gravity restriction during the past two years has been a desire to keep alive a form of control which has bean regarded in some quarters as effective for the prevention of drunkenness.     It appears to have been assumed that if the restriction&apos;were removed the production of highly alcoholic beers would be encouraged, and that this in tur-tfwould result in the serious growth of intemperance.      I agree with the President of the Board of Trade in thinking that this assumption is not well founded. The present high rate of duty   (which presses most heavily on the strongest beers),      and the necessarily high prices charged for heavy beers, are in themselves, sufficient to prevent   any substantial increase in the average gravity at which beer is brewed, especially as it is to the interest of the brewer to brew his beers of lew gravity so long as he can find a market for them.      Under the present arrangement any brewer may brew a certain quantity of strong beer provided the average gravities of all his beers does not exceed the prescribed average.       What would happen if the restriction as to average gravity were removed is that ho irl^ht brew a somewhat larger proportion of his higher gravity beers if there were a demand for such beers,   but,   as already indicated,   the demand would be much mere limited than formerly because ofthe
II I    1 I  I      L1 rthe higher price resulting necessarily from the present higher cost of production, of which the high duty forms an important part.      Indeed the effect, taking the country as whole, would at the bestrestimate I can form bo at the outside an increase in the average gravity of not more than 2 or 3 degrees. This is far from the higher average of 8 or more degrees before the War.5.    The President of the Board of Trade &amp;as pointed out the unequal.way in which the gravity restrictions have worked as between one class of brewer and another. My information entirely accords with hia on this aspect of the question.6.    In conclusion I should like as Chancellor of the Exchequer to emphasise that the present proposals would have a favourable effect on both sides of the national balance sheet.      If they were adopted, staff could be economised and expenditure reduced.    But far more important than this is their acticipated effect upon Revenue.   It is not, I think, sufficiently ^realised that at the present rates of duty and of output an increase of only one degree in the average gravity of beer brewed throughout the United Kingdom means an additional Revenue;of about  3.750,000 in a full year. Thus, if the average gravity rose by&quot; two degrees, theiigain to the Exchequer would be about  5,500,000.      If controls of gravity and of prices both disappeared end brewers were allowed freedom to conduct their business in a way best suited to their particular trade, I think that some Increase in output and a corresponding further gain to the Revenue might be anticipated though not, under present conditions, of a substantial kind.
7.      I believe for the reasons I have given that the removal of control in regard to the price and gravity of beer would have no deleterious effect upon the wellbeing of the people arad in these circumstances I trust that proposals which are bound to have a beneficial effect, upon the Revenue will be adopted.SPIgI0?S,.8.      The question whether the control of the retail prices of spirits should cease is more difficult.    The existing shortage of mature spirits might result, if control were abolished in an increase in retail prices which would limit consumption and reduce the &quot;yield of tho spirit revenue whilst profits remained the same or even increased.    On the other hand, the export trade is no longer in the flourishing condition that it was in a few months ago and this should ease the position in regard to the supply of mature spirits for the home market. Moreover, I do not consider that under present conditions any substantial increase in retail prices could take place without seriously affecting demand.      In these circumstances I agree, though with some hesitation, to the immediate removal of the control of retail spirit prices.9,     The control of inter-trade prices was a corollary of the control of retail prices and was imposed in order to protect trade interests .    There would no longer be any ground for the State to interfere in the prices charged by the blenders and wholesalers, if retail prices were released from control.
j.0.   As regards the limitation now imposed on the quantities of potable spirits allowed to be exported, I understand that the amount now being sent abroad is actually less than the quantities licensed.    I can, therefore, see no reason why this control should be maintained.(Initialled) R.S.H.Treasury, S .W.25th July, 1921,
