It was as high as 7-8 per cent, in 1908 and 7-7 per cent, in 1909.Throughout 1919 it ranged between 1-6 per cent, in September and 3-2 per cent, in December, and averaged 2-4 per cent, for the year.The figures for 1920 are :- Per cent.To the end of January   ...         ...        ...        ... 2-9February .......         ... 10March     ...        ...        ... -      ... 11April       ..................      0-9May        ..................     11June       ...        ...        ...        ...        ... 1&apos;2July..................     1-4August    ...        ...        ...        ...        ...

GENERAL.The settlement of the coal dispute has, as yet, had no marked effect on the volume of unemployment, although it may be noted that the number on the Exchange registers on the 1st July shows a small reduction as compared with the previous week. Work has been resumed in the majority of the colliery areas, but in some districts the pits cannot be reopened for some time, and in a few cases they are permanently closed. In the iron and steel industry, a number of firms are expecting to resume work within the next few weeks, but the position generally is somewhat uncertain, and much depends on the future cost of coal. Some improve-ment is reported from the shipyards in the North of England, but the industry generally remains very slack. Increasing enquiries are being received by cotton manufacturers, and, although the mills have at present only resumed short-time working, it is anticipated that conditions will improve in the near future. An improvement is also expected in the woollen industry. Employers in the lace trade report that orders have considerably increased. Employment in the boot and shoe trade has temporarily declined. In the pottery and glass industries work cannot be resumed for several weeks.II. EMERGENCY WORK.As announced by the Prime Minister on the 19th October, certain schemes have been put in hand by the Local Authorities in conjunction with the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Health, and by the Local Authorities themselves, designed to secure work for unemployed men, preferentially ex-Service men. The following is the result at this date: (a.) New Arterial Roads.20,626 men employed up to date (in and around London, 3,421; Provinces, 17,205).(b.) Road Maintenance.It is estimated that employment has been provided for approximately 20,000 men over and above those ordinarily so employed.(c.) Housing (Acceleration of the Lay-Out of Roads and Sewers and Approved Housing Schemes).Men employed up to the 1st July, 3,127 (in and around London, 238; Provinces, 2,889).(d.) Lord St. Davids&apos; Committee.Men employed on work other than the above up to the 1st July, 31,264 (in and around London, 4,680; Provinces, 26,584).(e.) Alternative Work in Government Establishments.War Office establishments: men employed up to the 2nd ,July, 2,773 (in and around London, 2,122; Provinces, 651).Alternative work provided in Admiralty establishments: men employed up to the 2nd July, 6,493 (in and around London, nil; Provinces, 6,493).(f.) Short-time in Government Establishments.Number of men who have found employment up to date as a result of the intro-duction of short-time system. Men employed up to the 2nd July : War Office estab-lishments, 1,932 (in and around London, 1,829; Provinces, 103); Admiralty estab-lishments, 2,728 (in and around London, 17.1; Provinces, 2,557).[6593]
1. The following statement represents the position as shown by the Exchange registers on the 1st July : -	Men.	Women.	Total.Numbers wholly unemployed Numbers on short time*	1,557,010 501,151	466,965 405,646	2,023,975 906,797Total......	2,058,161	872,611	2,930,7722. As a result of the operation of the Act of the 3rd March, 1921 (and of the grant of Out-of-Work Donation to ex-Service men and women), the following work-people are in receipt of Unemployment Benefit or Out-of-Work Donation: 				Men.	Women.	Total.Wholly unemployed (estimated) On short time*	1,526.072 501,151	437,048 405,646	1,963,120    -906.797Total......	2,027,223	842,694	2,869,917* There is no record of the number of workpeople on short time, who are not eligible to receive Unemployment Insurance or Out-of-Work Donation, i.e., those who are employed in such a way that they are unable to comply with the rules as to continuity of unemployment.O(g.) Emergency Work found by Local Authorities.Total number of men employed up to the 1st July, 12,983 (in and around London, 2,355; Provinces, 10,628).Total labour employed on above schemes = 101,926.As reports for the week ended the 1st July have been received from only 405 Local Authorities out of 436 who were asked to furnish information, it is probable that the Relief Schemes which have been inaugurated by the Government and Local Authorities are finding employment for a number of men in excess of the figures given.III. 50,000 EX-SERYICE MEN TO BE TRAINED IN THE BUILDINGINDUSTRY.The industrial stagnation caused by the coal stoppage, and the consequent uncertainty of the outlook, have seriously interfered with the progress of this scheme. The employers, however, have set up District Committees in many of the more important industrial centres, and the National Federation has instructed its members to post notices on all jobs advising their workpeople that the job is only open to men willing to work with and assist in the training of ex-Service men taken on under the scheme. This action has already been taken in London by the Master Builders and also by the Office of Works.Intimation was made in the House of Commons on the 29th June that as from the 1st September next contracts, in which the Government is financially interested and on which bricklayers, plasterers, slaters and tilers are to be employed, will in general be confined to contractors who are employing men under the conditions of the scheme. Government Departments have made arrangements to draw the attention of all their contractors to this intimation, and steps have been taken to urge contractors to apply the scheme, to current contracts as well.In the meantime, the total applications are 20,249. In the London and South-Eastern Division 8,784 men have applied, and the following are figures for other Divisions: South Midlands and Eastern Counties, 1,441: South-Western Counties, 1,820; West Midlands, 2.003; Yorkshire and East Midlands, 1,651: North-Western Counties, 2,534; Northern Division, 574; Scotland, 1,166; Wales, 276.IY.  PAYMENT OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT AND OUT-OF-WORKDONATION.
