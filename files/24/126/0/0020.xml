PART I-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.The improvement in the industrial situation continues, the districts of the Miners&apos; Federation having, by a large majority, ratified the terms of the proposed settlement. The agreement terminating the dispute was signed on the 1st July, and work was resumed in the majority of the pits on the 4th. In consequence of the condition of the mines, however, it is not anticipated that much coal will be raised during the first week after resumption, and three or four weeks must elapse before any general improvement can be looked for in the unemployment position as a result of the termination of the dispute.The ballot which is being taken of the shipyard joiners on the terms of settlement proposed by the employers is important, as this dispute is now seriously affecting employ -ment in the shipyards. The employers in the engineering industry have agreed to a further postponement of their notices for 14 days in order to enable a ballot vote of the men to be taken on the revised terms of settlement. It is generally anticipated that these terms will, be accepted, and it is probable that similar agreements will be made in the near future in those trades which usually follow engineering agreements.In view of the settlements of the last few weeks there is reason to anticipate a period of comparative peace in the industrial world. In this connection, it may be noted that Mr. J. H. Thomas, in a speech at Newcastle on the 3rd July, stated that he saw nothing which would warrant the suggestion that there is likely to he a great industrial railway strike in August next, when the decontrol of the railways is expected to take place. It should be observed, however, that some of his colleagues do not take such an optimistic view of the situation.Apart from the recent wage agreements, there is another important factor making for peace which should not be overlooked. Particulars are given below of the effect of the coal dispute upon the funds of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, and the position of this union may be regarded as typical of most. The financial position of the miners&apos; unions is serious in the extreme. It is reported that the Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Miners&apos; Associations have a combined debt of approxi-mately  750,000, and that they may find it necessary to levy their members to the extent of from 2s. to 4s. per week in excess of ordinary contributions, in order to pay off this debt. The miners, individually, are also reported to have incurred substantial debts during the struggle, and the Poor Rates in mining areas will have to be heavily increased.The opposition of the agricultural workers to the proposed abolition of the Agricul-tural Wages Board is taking definite shape ; there is a strong feeling that statutory wage-fixing bodies are essential if the workers are to be assured of a living wage. It may be noted that the Agricultural Wages Board met on the 5th July to consider pro-posals by the National Farmers&apos; Union, involving, inter alia, the reduction of the existing minimum rates of adult male workers to 40s. per week.* The proposals were opposed by the workers ; and the Board adjourned until the 21st July.The Annual General Meeting of the National Union of Railwaymen, which is the governing body of the union, opened at Newcastle on the 4th July; particulars of the first day&apos;s proceedings are given below.The Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1921, received Royal Assent on the 1st July. In the House of Commons, on the 5th, the Corn Production Acts (Repeal) Bill received its second reading, and the National Health Insurance Bill was read the third time and passed.* The present minimum is 46s., but rates have been fixed up to 50s. M.
The General Situation-continued.The Unemployment Position.Statistics. On the 24th June, in the United Kingdom 2,170,219 unemployment books under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and out-of-work donation, policies, remained lodged for workers totally unemployed, of which 1,626,435 were lodged by males and 543,784 by females. At the same date, 831,997 unemployment books and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers on short time, of which 492,764 were lodged by males and 339,233 by females.These figures show an increase on the previous week of 19,566 totally unemployed and a decrease of 15,227 in those working short time.The total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 1st July was 2,168,727. The above are advanced figures provided by the Employment Department and are subject to revision.A full analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 31.FEATURES OF THE WEEK.General Topics.Agriculture Act, 1920. A conference convened by the National Union of Agri-cultural Workers and the Agricultural Section of the Worker&apos;s Union was held at Caxton Hall, Westminster, on the 4th July, to consider the situation with regard to the proposed abolition of the Agricultural Wages Board. Between 300 and 400 delegates attended the conference, and brought mandates in the form of resolutions passed by branches demanding the preservation of the Board. Mr. Harry Grosling, who presided, stated in his opening speech that the assembly was the largest and most representative meeting of agricultural workers which had yet been held in this country, and that his presence, on behalf of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, was evidence that the Labour movement was prepared to assist the workers in the present crisis. Statements explaining the situation were made by Mr. B. B. Walker, Mr. Gr. Dallas and Mr. G. Edwards, M.P., and two resolutions wers passed unanimously. The first resolution pledged the members of the unions catering for agricultural workers to carry on propa-ganda to resist the proposal of the Government to abolish the Agricultural Wages Board, and advised that the question should be put before the workers and electors of each Parliamentary division by means of demonstrations. It was also urged that a national committee should be set up by the parties to the conference for the purpose of keeping in touch with the whole of the efforts to be made, and to give from time to time such help and advice as may be necessary.   The second resolution declared that : &quot; This meeting of workers&apos; representatives of District Wages Committees from every county in England and Wales strongly protests against the proposed abolition of the Agri-cultural Wages Board, declares it to be a gross betrayal of the rural workers, and calls upon the members of Parliament to vote for the retention of the Central Wages Board and District Wages Committees.&quot;A letter, signed by a majority of the members of the recent Royal Commission on Agriculture, was published in the Press on the 1st July, stating that it is the considered opinion of the writers that the abolition of the Agricultural Wages Board would be disastrous to the agricultural industry in England and Wales, unless the continuance of a legal minimum wage in the industry is assured.Washington International Labour Conference, 1919. In the House of Commons, on the 1st July, there was a further discussion on the policy pursued by the Government towards the Draft Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the General Conference Of the International Labour Organisation at their first session, at Washington, in November, 1919.An account of the previous discussion, on the 27th May, which was based on a motion by Mr. G. Barnes has already been given in this Report.^  On that occasion34048* See this Report Vol. III., No. 23, 4th June, p. 463.
9.7.21,20the Minister of Labour promised that opportunity would be given for a fuller discussion of the reasons which led the Government to determine not to ratify the Hours and Maternity Conventions. The discussion of the 1st July took place on a motion in the name of the Minister, in the following terms : &quot; That this House approves the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government respecting the several Conventions and Recommendations of the International Labour Conference at Washington, in November, 1919.&quot;In opening the debate, the Minister again outlined the policy of the Government towards each of the Washington Conventions and Recommendations, dealing in particular with the Hours and Maternity Conventions. With regard to the Hours Convention the Minister said that full consideration had been given to the suggestion put forward on the 27th May by Lord Robert Cecil that the Convention should be ratified with reservations, but the conclusion had been arrived at, that it would not be serving the ultimate interests of the International Labour Organisation to initiate a system of ratification with reservations. The Minister announced the policy the Government proposed to adopt, as follows : &quot; We propose to send a letter to Geneva explaining the difficulties which here confront us, and intimating that we-shall be very glad to take part in a reconsideration of the Hours Convention, probably drawn on rather more elastic lines, at a future Congress of the Inter-national Labour Organisation.&quot;At the conclusion of the debate, the resolution moved by the Minister was adopted by 164 votes to 53.Industrial and other Organisations.National Union of Railwaymen. The Annual General Meeting opened at Newcastle on the 4th July, 80 delegates being present. On the previous evening, Mr. J. H. Thomas addressed a mass meeting of railwaymen on his attitude and course of action during the coal dispute. He joined issue with those in the union who assumed that the duty of a leader was to do merely what the rank and file said, and not to give them advice. Ke also declared that the railwaymen were the only section entitled to judge him, and that outsiders who had no interest in the union were not so entitled.Mr. W. J. Abraham, in his presidential address, also gave an account of the inner history of the Triple Alliance negotiations in connection with the coal dispute, and stated that the reason why the railway and transport workers cancelled their sympathetic strike in support of the miners was the grievous error of judgment on the part of the miners in refusing to meet the Prime Minister on the morning of the loth April. He also dealt with the question of the decontrol of the railways, which is to take place on the 15th August, and stated that, although the Bill dealing with the subject was unsatisfactory in that it maintained private ownership, nevertheless the executive had Taken steps to safeguard the interests of their members. They had secured an agreement under which provision was made for machinery of a national character, and also for local machinery and committees to be set up for each railway, or group of railways, to deal with the local application of national agreements and other matters of a local nature. He also criticised the Amalgamated Engineering Union with reference to their attitude towards railway shopmen, which raised in an acute form the difference between craft and industrial trade unionism.The presidents references to Triple Alliance action in the coal dispute called forth some strong protests, and it was suggested that the address should be referred to the Standing Orders Committee for review. Mr. Thomas replied that the president was alone responsible for his address, and that there would be ample opportunity during the week for a full discussion of all controversial questions. In this connection, some account should be taken of Mr. Thomas&apos;s speech to a meeting of railway workers held at Derby on the 1st May, a report of which appeared in the Press for the first time on the 30th June. This speech, justifying his action in the coal dispute, contains similar arguments to those used in his address on the 3rd July. * He defended the course taken by the railway leaders, on the ground that so much uncertainty had been created by the action of the miners in relation to Mr. Hodge&apos;s statement to members of the House of Commons, that no strike declared in such an atmosphere could haye any chance of success. He also stated that he had no knowledge of the manifesto which was issued by the Alliance on the 12th April, but to which his signature was appended, and that he would never have agreed to its publication if he had been consulted beforehand, as it was in direct contra-diction to the views which he had expressed in the House of Commons on the 11th April.
Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen. The Journal of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen for July furnishes a striking example of the effect of the coal stoppage on the funds of trade unions not directly concerned with the dispute.The Superannuation, Death, Sickness and Orphan Funds of the union are said to be in a most healthy and satisfactory condition &quot;, but the Protection Fund&quot; is in anything but such a state, for, although we commenced 1921 with  36,244 9s. M. in that Fund, the fearful drain in Short Time Benefit, as a result of the Miners&apos; Lock-out, ha? not only wiped this out, but we are carrying an overdraft in addition, Care and economy by everyone concerned, from the General Secretary downwards, will be necessary for some time with regard to this Fund, so that as quickly as may be we may rebuild a Fund capable of fighting any battle which we may have to enter.&quot;National Union of Railway Women1 s Guild. The 21st annual conference of the Guild, which is an organisation of the wives of railwaymen and has a membership of over 3000, was held on the 29th June at Bristol, over 100 delegates from all parts of the country being present. Mr. J. Holmes, general organiser of the National Union, who was present in place of Mr. Cramp, addressed the conference and expressed the opinion that they were &quot; faced with a greater prospect of a fight in August&quot;, than ever before. He based his opinion upon speeches made by railway directors, and urged the importance of women&apos;s co-operation in the industrial and political struggle, especially with regard to training children in socialistic principles.Resolutions were adopted criticising the Governments unemployment policy, as well as the reduction of unemployment benefit and increase of contributions, and advocating work or maintenance for the unemployed. Other resolutions demanded the withdrawal from factories and workshops of married women whose husbands were able to maintain them, state maintenance for widows, especially those with young children, the payment of old age pensions at 65, and the suspension of the further 10 per cent! increase in rents. Further resolutions protested against the limitation of the number of contracts allowed to the National Building Guild and the proposals to economise in the education of children, urged the provision of maintenance up to the age of 16, and demanded the with-drawal of all troops from Ireland.Mrs. Webb (Bristol) was re-elected general secretary for the ensuing year with Mrs. Roberts (Gloucester) as colleague. The following persons were elected to be members of the General Executive: Mrs. Carpenter (Birmingham and Central District), Mrs. Yates (Midland and Eastern), Mrs. Wyatt (South Wales and Monmouth), Mrs. Roberts (South-Western), Mrs. Frith (North-Eastern), Mrs. Welden (London and South-Eastern), Mrs. Butler (Cheshire and North Wales), and Mrs. Austin (Yorkshire).Industrial League and Council. A memorandum has been issued by the League, emphasising the critical position into which industry has drifted, and urging the establish-ment of more &quot; Whitley Councils&quot; as a means of promoting greater confidence between employers and employed.   The memorandum further states that: &quot; The formation of a National Joint Industrial Council would not, in the opinion of the Industrial League, do much to lessen the tension existing. Rather would it add to the difficulties, as a National Council, whilst it would be useful for the exchange of opinions, would be too unwieldy and complex to be of any use as a means for industrial harmony. As an alternative, the Industrial League advocates strongly the formation of Joint Industrial Councils in every industry as the only means whereby disruption in industry may be avoided ; seventy of these have already been established, most of which have been very successful.&quot;Railway Nationalisation Society. The annual conference was held in London on the 27th June. There was an increase over 1919 of eight affiliated organisations, consisting of co-operative societies, trade councils and trade unions and branches, the present total being&apos; 735. A discussion on the Railway Bill now before Parliament took place,&apos; in&apos; the course of which Mr. Emil Davies regretted that the three railway unions gave up the demand for part control of the railways, as there was no doubt that the workers&apos; represen-tatives could demand figures, and other information, and be a thorn, in the side of the -railway companies.
NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Engineers (National). A second ballot vote of the men involved in this dispute is being taken by the trade unions concerned, on the terms of the proposed agreement. In the meantime the employers&apos; notices, which would otherwise have expired on the 30th June, have been suspended for 14 days.The ballot papers, which are returnable by the 12th July, show the terms of the proposed settlement,^ and it is pointed out that the Delegate Conference recommended their acceptance.Woollen Textile Workers (Scotland). With reference to the negotiations, referred to in last week&apos;s issue of this Report, between representatives of the Scottish Woollen Trade Employers&apos; Association and representatives of the trade unions concerned, it is reported that no settlement has been reached. Both parties, however, have agreed jointly to refer the question to the Industrial Court, and arrangements have been made for the case to be heard in Glasgow on the 7th July.Dock Labourers (National). A further meeting of the National Joint Council for Dock Labour was held on the 29th June,f when negotiations were again adjourned until a date to be fixed. Meanwhile, the proposed reduction of 2s. per day which was to, take effect on the 1st July has been postponed.Strikes and Lockouts.Shipyard Joiners (National). It will be remembered that a meeting was held at Edinburgh on the 30th June between representatives of the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation and the executive council of the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers with a view to terminating this dispute. It is reported that the employers proposed an immediate reduction of 12s. 2d. per week, and a further reduction of 3s. on the 1st September. Negotiations are to take place in October with regard to further possible reductions.A ballot vote of the men, which is to be completed by the 9th July, is being taken on the above proposals.Engineering Apprentices (Manchester and Stockport).-In consequence of ah intimation by the Manchester Engineering Employers Association of a reduction in* See this Report, Vol. IV., No. 1, 2nd July, p. 5. t See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 26, 25th June, p. 516.The following resolution was moved by Mr. Emil Davies, and seconded by Major Barnes, M.P. :-&quot; That this meeting of the Railway Nationalisation Society, representing over five million affiliated members, desires to express its conviction that all the arguments used to support the partial grouping of the railway system point logically and irresistibly to the complete unification of the railways of the country under one management and control; and, seeing that cheap transport is essential to the community, we urge upon the Government the desirability of removing railway transport from the domain of private profit, and running it as a public service for the benefit of the country&apos;s trade and industry, and the whole community.&quot;Mr. Bromley, in supporting the motion, stated that he greatly regretted the failure of the railway unions in regard to workers&apos; control. He considered that part control would give him the right to figures and information which would prove invaluable.Labour Parly. The place of meeting of the next annual conference of the Labour Party was erroneously given as Scarborough in last week&apos;s issue of this Report. The conference will be held at Edinburgh.
239.7.21..wages of apprentices as from the 2nd July, a large number of apprentices in the Manchester and Stockport areas have ceased work. It is reported in the Press that about 9,000 youths are affected.Settlements and Agreements. *&quot;Coal Miners (National). The miners&apos; executive met in London on the afternoon of the 1st July to consider the reports from the districts on the proposed terms of settlement. The voting showed a majority of 727,0^0 in favour of a settlement; the figures being 832,840 for and 105,820 against. The districts voting in favour were Derbyshire,. Durham, Leicester, the Midland Federation, Northumberland, North Wales, South Wales, Nottinghamshire, Yorkshire and Scotland. Cumberland remained neutral, and Bristol, the Forest of Dean, Kent, Lancashire and Somerset voted against the settle-ment. The enginemen and cokemen also voted for the terms proposed. Later in the day the agreement was ratified at the Mines Department of the Board of Trade, the signatories being officials of the Miners&apos; Federation, officials of the Mining Association, and the Secretary for Mines. On the same day a telegram was issued by the miners&apos; executive to all districts, ordering a resumption of work without delay, and where possible, work was resumed throughout the coalfields on the 4th July, but criticisms by the miners of their officials are reported from certain districts, notably Lancashire, South Wales and Cumberland.On the 1st July a sum not exceeding  10,000,000 was voted by the House of Commons &quot; as a subvention in aid of the coal-mining industry&quot;.Plumbers (Grantham). It will be remembered that as a result of a conference&apos; between the &quot;Grantham Master Builders&apos; Association and the Grantham building trade operatives on the 20th June, a resolution was adopted that all work in connection with the gas services and fittings in all houses and buildings in the borough of Grantham should be carried out by plumbers, who are to be paid the standard rate of wages appertaining to the building trade. This has now been considered by the executive committee of the United Operative Plumbers and Domestic Engineers&apos; Association, who have informed the local branch that they are prepared to approve the new working rule provided that it is also signed by the gas company. Work is proceeding in the ordinary way, and the gas company are to be allowed to finish the work that is now incomplete,, but the Grantham Master Builders&apos; Association state that they will insist upon the new working rule being observed by the gas company in connection with any further-houses which are put up.Iron and Steel Trade Workers (National).-$o\hw&apos;mg on negotiations at York on the 1st July, between representatives of the employers in the iron and. steel trades and representatives of the National Union of General Workers and the National Amalgamated Union of Labour, agreements relating to wages and working conditions of labourers and: semi-skilled workers have been reached. It is understood that arrangements are under consideration to create national machinery for dealing with future disputes, the principle of arbitration being included.Machine Tool Makers (Sheffield). Following on negotiations between the Sheffield Engineers&apos; Small Tools&apos; Association and the Iron and Steel Trades&apos;&apos; Confederation, an agreement has been reached for a reduction in wages of 17^- per cent, from war bonuses,, to take effect on the 8th July. This reduction will normally amount to 8s. per week, and is applicable to both time-workers and piece-workers, and will last for a period of six months.Screw Makers (Birmingham). At a conference on the 22nd June between the Screw Manufacturers&apos; Association, the Workers&apos; Union and the Screw, Nut, Bolt and Rivet Trade Society, an agreement was made for a reduction in wages of 3s. per week as from the beginning of the pay period following the 27th. June, and a similar-reduction as from the beginning of the pay period following the 5th September.Hosiery Workers (Hawick District).-An agreement has been concluded between representatives of the Hawick Manufacturers&apos; Association and representatives of the National Union of General Workers, which provides for a reduction of 17^ per cent, on bonus wages to experienced hosiery workers, and a reduction of 20 per cent, on apprentices&apos;&apos; wages, the altered rates to become operative as from the 20th June.
9.7.21.Sawmillers (Various Districts). Following on negotiations between representatives of the Birmingham and District Timber Merchants&apos; Association and the Workers&apos; Union, an agreement has been reached for a reduction in wages of l\d. per hour as from the pay-day in the week commencing the 27th June. The union have asked for a conference to discuss a proposal for a further similar.reduction to come into operation on the 27th July.-An agreement has also been reached between the tyne and District Sawmill Owners&apos; Association and the Amalgamated Society of Woodcutting Machinists, applicable to the whole of the North-East Coast. The agreement provides for a reduction of 2d, per hour from the wages of sawyers and machinists as from the 4th July.Packing Case Makers (Birmingham). At a conference between the Birmingham and District Packing Case Manufacturers&apos; Association and the Workers&apos; Union on the 22nd June, it was agreed that there should be a reduction of 3s. per week in the case of day-workers and 1\ per cent, in the case of piece-workers, to take effect from the first full pay period in July, and a similar reduction to take effect &quot; at the commencement of the pay period ending the 2nd or 3rd September.&quot; It was also agreed that the whole question of wages should be reconsidered later in the light of prevailing conditions.Pianoforte Workers (National). It is reported in the Press that anew agreement has been signed by representatives of the employers and workers in the pianoforte industry.- This agreement standardises conditions, and fixes a 47-hour week, with a craffcsman&apos;s rate of 2s. an hour, and remains in force until the cost-of-living index number falls below 100.sk^&apos; [Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Industrial Relations Departments section of the Report, pages 25 to -29.]
PART IL-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DEPARTMENT.ENGINEERING, SHIPBUILDING AND ALLIED TRADES.Optical Instrument Manufacturing. A special meeting of the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee was held on the 23rd June to consider a new wages agree-raent.* The representatives of the Amalgamated Engineering Union intimated that their instruction was that no reduction in wages could be accepted, but this did not prevent the consideration of further proposals. The union did not want the industry to follow the conditions in any other industry. After various proposals and counter-proposals had been discussed, the employers&apos; side offered a reduction, for timeworkers, of Id. per hour as from the first pay in July; Id. per hour as from the first pay in August;. \d. per hour as from the first pay in October; \d. per hour as from the first pay in November; for piece-workers, reductions, on the same dates, of 4^ per cent., 4-g- per cent., 2^ per cent., and 2T1-g- per cent.; and proportionate reductions in the case of semi-skilled and unskilled workers, and unindentured apprentices, with a nine months&apos; agreement. A representative of the National Union of General Workers (Women&apos;s Section) pointed out that such reductions would bring the women&apos;s rate below the Trade Board minimum rate in various other industries, and it was finally agreed that the question of reduction in women&apos;s wages should be deferred. The employers&apos; side agreed &apos; to communicate their final proposal in writing, in order that it could be submitted to the executive of the Amalgamated Engineering Union.FOOD AND DRINK.Flour Milling. At a meeting of the Industrial Council, on the 28th June, the following reductions in wages were agreed to : For men, 21 years and over, 5s. per week, from the 2nd July and 2s. M. per week from the 2nd September; for those 19 to 20  years, 3s. and 2s.; for those of 18^ years, 2s. &amp;d. and . 2s.; and for youths from 16 to 18, 2s. and 2s.; for women, a reduction of 3s. from the first pay-day after 2nd July.  The adult male rates are to remain in operation until the 31st December, but the rates for females and youths are to be reviewed at the end of September.Brewery Workers (Yorkshire). The Chief Conciliation Officer reports that, a difficulty has arisen between the Yorkshire Brewers&apos; Association and the Workers&apos; Union, Brewery Workers1 Section, over a proposal to reduce the wages of adult males by the 7s. per week advance granted in April, 1920. The secretary of the employers&apos; association has asked the Chief Conciliation 0 nicer to act as a neutral chairman should negotiations break down.POTTERY, RUBBER AND GLASS.Rubber Manufacturing. The agreement arrived at by the Rubber Heel Sectional Joint Council respecting the minimum rate for labourers in Lancashire and Cheshire has been considered further by a meeting of the India Rubber Manufacturers&apos; Association. It is stated that the Southern Counties representatives strongly opposed the agreement, and declared that there was now no need to negotiate wages questions with any trade union. Information has also been received to the effect that the Association is showing-signs of internal trouble, and that there is a possibility of its splitting up into district bodies.Owing, it is alleged, to the state of trade, the Cape Asbestos Company have closed down their works as from the 22nd June. The matter, for the present, may be considered as closed.f        -* See this Report, Vol. III., No. 19, 7th May, p. 400, No. 22, 28th May, p.^452, and No. 25, 18th June, p. 500.f See this Report, Vol. III., No. 26, 25th June, page 518.
* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 26, 25th Jivae, p. 519.Glass Industry. On a claim by Messrs. Molineaux, Webb &amp; Co., Ltd., Manchester, for a reduction of 25 per cent, in the wages of their workers, members of the National Union of General Workers, the Industrial Court awarded a reduction of 15 per cent, to operate in two equal amounts of 7^ per cent., the first reduction to take effect on the date on which the works re-opened, and the second from the beginning of the 9th week after that date.SOAP AND CHEMICALS.Seed Crushing and Compound Cake Manufacture. At a meeting of the Industrial Council on the 28th June, after a long and friendly discussion, the workers accepted reductions of 3s. on the first pay-day after the .16th July, and a further 3s. on the first pay-day in August, with half these deductions in the case of women and youths. The trade union representatives are to notify their members that this reduction has been agreed to, and that the employers intend to ask for a further reduction of 4s. on the first pay-day in October. It was stated that the employers had decided that when the cost of living fell to the pre-war figure, rates of pay should be 25 per cent, or 30 per cent, above pre-war level.Soap and Candles. A meeting of the Industrial Council was held on the 29th June to consider a demand by the employers for reductions of 8s. for men and 6s. for women. The employers firmly maintained their demand, in so far as it affected the rates at Port Sunlight, but hinted that they might accept a proposal for division into monthly reductions. The workers&apos; representatives undertook to notify their members that the reduction was demanded, and they are to meet on the 4th July in the hope of formulating a proposal to be presented to a meeting of the Council on the 5th.TEXTILES.Wool [and Allied) Textiles. A further meeting^ of the Industrial Council was held in Bradford on the 27th June. After some discussion of the position of colonial wool sorters under the proposed new agreement, the terms of settlement were formally ratified.PRINTING AND PAPER.Printing. At a joint conference of the Federation of Master Printers and the unions on the 28th June, the proposed reduction of 15s. per week was discussed in general terms. It appears that no decision has yet been reached among the unions as to whether the Printing and Kindred Trades Federation shall negotiate for the whole group, and the final verdict of the Typographical Association on this point is not expected until the 12th July. Negotiations therefore were adjourned until the 14th July, and the quarterly meeting of the Industrial Council was postponed until the 26th July. Individual notices, expiring on the 28th July, have now been tendered by the Federation to the various unions and it is understood that the Scottish section of the master printers have decided that, if no general settlement is reached by that date, they will proceed to negotiate a settlement for their own district. A similar tendency is at work in some other- districts of the federation.Paper Making. At the request of the trade union side, an emergency meeting of the Industrial Council was held in Manchester on the 1st July to discuss the position which had resulted from the ballot on the wages reductions. It is understood that a settlement was reached, subject to confirmation, on the lines of the employers&apos; offer, namely, a reduction of 2d. per hour as from the first pay-day in July ; a reduction of l^d. per hour when the cost-of-living index number reaches 1.15, and a further reduction of l\d. when it reaches 100. The operatives were apprehensive, in view of the recent movements of the index number, that the first two reductions would come into force with cumulative effect almost at once. To meet this fear the employers agreed that one month&apos;s grace should be given before successive reductions were put into force, and that, should the index number rise, the corresponding advance of wages should be given at once. They also stated that it was not their intention to reduce th^ level of wages to the 1914 standard.   These assurances were considered satisfactory.
* See this Report Vol. Ill, No. 25,18th June, p. 502,Envelopes and Manufactured Stationery. The adjourned wages negotiations^ were continued on the 27th June. After considerable discussion, the employers agreed to a further meeting of the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee on the 11th July, the workers giving an undertaking that on that date they would continue the negotiations to a conclusion, irrespective of the position of negotiations in the printing or other trades. As the printing negotiations have been postponed to the 14th July, the Committee will re-assemble in precisely the same circumstances as before.PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND PUBLIC UTILITY SERVICES.Electricity Supply. The National Coancil held their second annual meeting and their ordinary monthly meeting on the 30th June. It was provisionally agreed that the Council should be increased from 13 members on each side to a maximum of 26 on each side, and that the employers&apos; side should consist of 13 municipal and 13 company repre-sentatives, appointed by and from the District Councils. A conference of all employers&apos; members of the District Councils will be held about the 20th July to consider the scheme further. The trade union side agreed to recommend their executives to agree to a national reduction on similar lines to that adopted by the gas industry on the 28th June, to operate from the same dates, which would involve a reduction of fis. on the loth July and of 3s. on the 16th September.The National Joint Board of Employers and staff Members met on the 1st July. The representation of the clerical staffs on the Board was again under ^consideration, and a deputation was received, from the National Association of Local Grovernment Officers. An alteration in the constitution of the Board in regard to the number of members, similar to that provisionally agreed on by the Joint Industrial Council on the 30th June, was approved in principle.Local Authorities1 Non-Tradings Services, Manual Workers (England and Wales).  The National Council met on the 1st July. It was decided that further consideration be given to the subjects, including the proposed reconstitution of the employers&apos; side, which are to be discussed at the conference of the National Council with representatives of the District Councils, which will probably be held in September.The District Council for Lancashire and Cheshire, on the 7th June, revised the wages recommendations made to local authorities by the Council in June, 1920. The 1920 wages agreement provided for basic rates of pay, plus a fixed bonus of 164 per cent. The new agreement reduces the bonus to 145 per cent., and provides for increases or decreases of the bonus according to variations in the cost-of-living index number.The District Council for the Southern Home Counties, on the 17th June, decided to recommend, for adoption by local authorities within the area, a scale of minimum rates of pay for skilled employees. The Council also decided to withdraw the scale of minimum rates recommended on the 12th April for women employees.Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services, Manual Workers (Scotland). The Council met on the 28th June. Proposals were made by the employers&apos; side for an immediate reduction in wages. The trade union side agreed that there should be a reduction, but urged the employers&apos; side to accept the principle of grouping and grading local authorities for the determination of appropriate rates of pay. The employers&apos; side were prepared to accept this principle, provided that the employees would&apos; agree to an im-mediate reduction of 4s. per week ; the basic rate for workers in Croup A to be  2 a week, and the difference between  2 a week and the present wages, less 4s. a week, to be treated as a bonus, on the basis of a cost-of-living index number of 120, reductions from this point to he ^ for every five points reduction in the index number. These proposals will be considered further on the 5th July. The Association of District Committees have withdrawn from the Council.Waterworks Undertakings.-ThQ second annual meeting of the Joint Industrial Council was held on the 1st July. A scheme for the revision of wages, recommended by the Executive Committee, was unanimously adopted. It provides, that, as from the commencement of the first full pay-week on or after the 1st July, and thereafter at three-monthly intervals, the hourly rate of pay shall be increased or decreased by \d. per
hour for every full 6 points by which the cost-of-living index number varies, on the average of each period, above or below 146*. The scheme is to cease to operate by way of reduction when the rates paid in July,! 914, plus 50 per cent, are reached ; and the scales of pay determined by the scheme are not to apply to those authorities who have not paid the approved district rates, until the rates actually paid are reached by the operation of this sliding scale. It is recommended that, where reductions have already taken place, they shall be merged in carrying out this scheme. The Council also decided to recommend that a minimum of 12 days&apos; holiday per annum, with pay, be granted to all employees who have completed 12 months service with one undertaking.GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.National Council for the Administrative and legal Departments of the Civil Service.  The 11th meeting of the National Council was held on the 27th June, Sir Malcolm JRamsay, K.C.B., in the chair.The final report of the Committee on the Organisation of the Civil Service and a report of the Cost-of-Living Committee dealing with the remuneration of temporary manipulative Post Office classes, were formally adopted. A second interim report of the Further Education Committee, dealing with civil servants over 16 years of age, was adopted, subject to the reservation of one paragraph for further consideration.The Council referred to a committee composed of the chairman, the vice-chairman, and the&apos; secretaries, a reference from the Admiralty Departmental Council in regard to. a disagreement on tnat Council.The official side stated that they were unable to make proposals which would involve-an increase in travelling and subsistence allowances as a whole, and that therefore any revision to remove anomalies would involve a reduction of rates in certain cases. They agreed to submit proposals to be discussed, if necessary, by representatives of each side.The staff side proposed that the 1st January, 19S0, should be fixed as the date from, which approved reorganisation schemes should become operative throughout the service.. The official side were unable to accept the suggestion, and a formal disagreement was recorded.The Council agreed that it would be desirable to frame a universal rule governing seniority as between civil servants appointed from the same examination. The exact form of this rule was reserved for further consideration.The Council agreed that service with the Armies of Occupation up to the 31st December, 1920, is not to be prevented from reckoning for increment and pension in cases where a civil servant volunteered under the Army of Occupation Scheme before the 5th March, 1919, or, having volunteered after that date, had no prior reason to think that his department objected, and returns to his department as soon as released from his--obligation.The Council were unable to agree to the appointment of a committee to consider the reorganisation of the legal classes of the service ; but the official side offered to arrange for an informal discussion at the Treasury between representatives of these classes of the Government.War Department. At a special meeting of the Industrial Council, called at the request of the official side, on the 28th June, it was explained that the employees in the-War Department establishments at Woolwich numbered about 20,000, but that, as there was no prospect of being able to maintain more than the pre-war number, about 14,300, the Cabinet had decided that the necessary reductions were to be made. The War Office had arranged for this decision to take effect from the 8th July, and for notices to be posted on the 1st July. The discharges, would be at the rate of 300 a week. The trade union side recognised the necessity for the reductions, and appreciated the considerate manner in which they were being made. The prospect of finding alternative work for the Arsenal was briefly discussed, but was not pressed by the trade union side.PROFESSIONAL WORKERS.Entertainments. A meeting of the National Industrial Council was. held on the 1st July. The position of members of the theatrical industry in respect of unemploy-ment benefit was discussed, complaints being made by the trade union side that benefits-had been refused in certain cases, although contributions had been paid. It was explained
GENERAL DEPARTMENT.TRADE BOARDS. PROCEEDINGS.Dressmaking and Womerfs Light Clothing Trade Board (England and Wales). The Board considered letters from the Ministry relating to the variation of -minimum rates of wages for female workers in the retail bespoke dressmaking branch. After consideration of the Ministry&apos;s suggested amendments to the Board&apos;s Notice of Proposal to vary minimum rates, it was agreed to vary the rates subject to certain verbal amendments, and to an amendment of the definition of a.qualified worker. The Board recommend that the minimum rates as varied shall become effective as from the 11th July, 1921.Dressmaking and Women&apos;s Light Clothing- Trade Board (Scotland). After ^consideration of the objection which had been lodged to their Proposal to vary the minimum rates for learners in the retail branch of the trade, the Board , decided to vary the minimum rates substantially in accordance with the Notice of Proposal. In making the variation, the Board have cancelled the previous provision with regard to the six-monthly advances to learners becoming payable on the first Monday in January and July, respectively. Such advances will accordingly become due as from the date on which each worker completes each successive period of six months&apos; service.Eat, Cap and Millinery Trade Board (England and Wales). The Board have agreed to vary the general minimum time-rates and overtime rates for female learners, other than those employed in any branch of the wholesale and retail cloth hat and cap section of the trade, in accordance with the Notice of Proposal dated the 21st April, and to recommend that the minimum rates as varied shall become effective as from the 25th July, 1921.* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 21, 21st May, p. 439.by an officer of the department that the possibility of providing special Exchange facilities for the industry was under consideration. In view of the resignation of certain of the employers&apos; associations, a resolution was agreed on requesting the department to convene separate conferences of each side with a view to a reconstitution of the Council.MISCELLANEOUS  TRADES.Export Packing and Cloth Working (London District). At a meeting of the London District Council, on the 30th June, a wages agreement was arrived at, the Council having adjourned on two previous occasions for further reference to their respective associations. * By the terms of the agreement wages in both sections will go back to those in operation in April, 1920, when the cost of living was 130 per cent, above pre-war level. This will involve an average reduction of about 4s. per week. On the publication of the cost-of-living index number for July a sliding scale will come into operation, which will involve a variation, on an average, of 2s. 8d. for each 10 points variation in the index number. The operation of the sliding scale from an index number of 130 per cent, makes the variation for each 10 per cent, rise or fall slightly larger than that previously proposed.   Variations are to be considered every three months.Cricket Ball Manufacturers (Tonbridge). The Industrial Court have awarded a reduction *of 15 per cent, as from the 27th June, 1921, and a further reduction of 10 per cent, from the 3rd September, 1921, making the addition over list prices 22^- per cent, as from the 27th June, and 121 Per cen^ as &amp;om the 3rd September.[ Reference to matters of interest in connection with Industrial Relations will be found also on pages 18 to 24, 29, 30, 35 and 36.]
General Department continued.After consideration of certain opinions expressed by the Minister as to the scope of the Board, the Board agreed to adopt them, except the opinion that the operations of job cleaning and dyeing old felt and straw hats are not within the scope of the Board. In this case, it was agreeed to inform the Minister that this opinion should be amended to read &quot;job cleaning and dyeing old felt and straw hats, when not carried on in association with the manufacture, or renovating, of felt or straw hats.&quot;Eat, Cap and Millinery Trade Board (Scotland). After consideration of the objections lodged to their Proposal to vary the minimum rates for female learners other than those in the wholesale cloth hat and cap making section, the Board agreed to vary the rates substantially as proposed, and recommended that the variation shall become effective as from the 1st August. In varying the rates, the Board have cancelled the-previous provision with regard to the date on which the half-yearly advances to learners are payable, and each individual worker will accordingly now be entitled to her advance as from the date on which she completes each successive period of six months&apos; service,The Board also resolved to issue a Notice of Proposal to vary the minimum rates for female learners in the wholesale cloth hat and cap branch, the proposal involving a, reduction in the rates for the younger learners.Milk Distributive Trade Board (Scotland). The principal business before the Board was the consideration of the question of fixing of the minimum&apos; rates proposed in their Notice of the 26th April.* After consideration of the objections,&apos; the Board unanimously resolved to fix the minimum rates in accordance with their Notice of&apos; Proposal, and to suggest the 1st August, 1921, as the date from which they should become effective.Perambulator and Invalid Carriage Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board considered a motion, on behalf of the representatives of employers, to reduce the minimum rates by 20 per cent., and agreed to propose a variation in the minimum rates for adult workers by a reduction of 12  per cent, in the case of male workers, and of 10 per cent., in the case of female workers, with certain reductions for younger workers. The pro-posals further include the adoption of a sliding scale whereby the minimum rates of&quot; wages for all workers shall be reduced by \d. should the cost-of-living index number fall below 106J, and by a further \d. should it fall below 100, the reduction to become effective quarterly.FIXING AND VARIATION OF MINIMUM RATES OF WAGES.Ostrich and Fancy Feather and Artificial Flower Trade Board [Great Britain),  The Minister has made an Order, dated the 28th June, confirming the general minimum time-rates; piecework basis time-rates and overtime rates as fixed for male workers,, excepting workers employed as dyers in the feather trade, and for female workers, and. hasv specified the 4th July as the date from which they shall become effective.The rates fixed are a general minimum time-rate for male workers, 22 years of age and over, of Is. 2d. per hour, with lower rates for younger workers ; and a general minimum time-rate of 8f/. per hour for female workers, including homeworkers, with lower rates for-learners.

There is no material change in the industrial position, and, although a more optimistic tone prevails in regard to a revival of trade, the dominant note of the reports, which were written before the decision in regard to the coal dispute was known, is still the general paralysis of industry &quot;owing to the shortage of coal. The principal changes reported during the week are as follows: Menh Employment,Iron and Steel. Registrations at the Bridgeton and Glasgow Exchanges have been very heavy as the result of the suspension of the workers of the Singer Manufacturing Co., Ltd., and those from the engineering department of Sir Wm. Arrol and Co., Ltd. Apart from the cOal shortage, firms in the Kilmarnock district are experiencing difficulty in keeping going, owing to shortage of material and lack of orders. Firms in the Airdrie district, however, are reported to have good orders on hand, and anticipate resuming full-time working when fuel is available. At Paisley, Messrs. Fullerton, Hodgart and Barclay, Ltd., are now working full-time and expect to continue. On the other hand, the suspension of workers by the North British Locomotive Co., Ltd., and at the Hyde Park Works continues, at the rate of 30 and 50 employees, respectively, per week.In the Northern Division Messrs. Dorman, Long and Co., Ltd., Middlesbrough, having secured a cargo of coal, have been able to re-employ 900 men previously reported as suspended. Another large firm of ironmasters in Middlesbrough are -at present dis-charging a cargo of coal, and, if this is not commandeered by the municipal authorities, they hope to re-employ some 800 workpeople almost immediately. At South Bank, Messrs. Bolckow, Vaughariand Co., Ltd., have re-started a number of fitters and labourers on maintenance work in their steel works.^ The position at Sheffield is a little easier, mainly as a&apos; result of fuel supplies being more plentiful. A firm of tube makers employing some 800 workmen are said to be on the point of re-starting their works. At Derby the Midland Railway Company are keeping most of their shops working on a short-time system; at Doncaster the Great Northern Railway plant works are only working three days a week. At Ilkeston the Stanton Ironworks Co., Ltd., have re-engaged 140 of their workers, but 70 furnace men who had been employed on new plant extensions have been discharged. In the West Midlands Division, Messrs. C. Clifford &amp; Son, Ltd.. Stirchley, metal rollers, have closed for an indefinite period, and at Wednesbury, Messrs. Spencer &amp; Co., Ltd., employing some 150 men, have also closed down. Further restrictions in the supply of gas at Willenhall has resulted in lock manufacturers reducing their working time from four to three days a week.
Employment and Insurance Department-continued.Shipbuilding mid Allied Industries. On the Clyde, discharges from the yards have been more numerous, owing to the completion of contracts and the near approach of the Fair holiday. It is understood that several large firms will close during the holidays for extended periods of 14 and 21 days. On the Wear the&apos;immediate outlook is bad, as very few orders are on hand ; unemployment is likely to continue at a high level even with a settlement of the coal dispute. On the Mersey, repair work is still very quiet, although improving ; the work on hand consists principally of docking, painting, and small repair work. A few firms are busy overhauling engines and and repairing and converting boilers for oil fuel.In South Wales, repair work at Newport is almost at a complete standstill, and at Swansea only one yard, employing some 200 men, is working.Textiles and Clothing. In the cotton trade the settlement of the wages dispute has given general satisfaction, and the various branches are looking forward to a fairly active time.Short-time working in the lace trade has increased during the week. There is a fair demand for lace goods and the prospects of an improvement in this trade are considered good. In the hosiery trade, manufacturers are fairly busy and are able to keep most of their machinery going if fuel is available. The boot and shoe trade continues to improve the recent difficulties in regard to supplies of gas having been remedied to some extent by the use of power from other sources. The position of the woollen trade is unchanged, but the opinion is expressed in some quarters that more normal conditions of employment may be expected when coal supplies are available.Miscellaneous Trades. Herring fishing at Wick has improved considerably, although not sufficiently to require additional workmen for curing. - The number of vessels landing fish at Milford Haven has increased.In the London area unemployment is serious in almost all occupations. Clapham Junction report that the Welsbach Light Co., Ltd., and the Yolker Lighting Corporation,. Ltd., employing between 800 to 1,200 workers, intend closing their factories. At Hammersmith, Messrs. Cwynnes, Ltd., have placed a further 120 workers on short time, owing to a shortage of raw material and to cancelled orders. In the building trade, the majority of jobs for tradesmen, with the exception of bricklayers and plasterers, are of short duration. In the inner London area the demand for bricklayers has declined considerably.WomerCs Employment.Local Reports. The North-Western Division report that the unemployment situation remains abnormal. At Farnworth, however, there are signs that the cotton trade will resume normal working, as a considerable number of orders from foreign markets have been received. There is still no improvement in the shoe and slipper industry. In the seasonal resorts, employment is improving ; the summer season has begun and, with the continued fine weather, there has been an influx of visitors at most places. Blackpool state that workers are now being imported. Employment is better in the Liverpool area, owing chiefly to seasonal work in jam-making. Shop assistants are being employed for the sale periods in the large drapery establishments.The Yorkshire and East Midlands Division report that, though it is hoped that there will be a considerable improvement as soon as fuel supplies are available, there is still acute depression in the textile industry.Nottingham report that the staple industries of the town are depressed, although there are indications that, had the coal dispute been settled sooner, the lace trade, neck-wear, blouse and robe industries would have rapidly recovered.. There is a slight improvement in the lace trade at Beeston and Basford, but no change at Derby or Ilkeston. tThe South Midlands and Eastern Division continue to report slight improvements in the hosiery and silk industries, but short time has increased in the boot and wholesale clothing trades.Orders for additional fruit-pickers have been notified at Cambridge, and at Chelmsf ord a large order has been notified for black currant pickers. Pickers have also been placed at Kings Lynn and Lowestoft.
LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.. Unemployment Insurance. A considerable number of committees express disagree^ ment with the Governments decision to increase the rates of contributions and reduce the amount of benefit payable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts. The Shipley Committee take the view that, before the amending Bill was introduced, divisional conferences of representatives of Local- Employment Committees should have been convened, to advise the Minister upon the desirability of the proposed measure.The Finchley Committee continue to urge the department to* press for the completk inclusion of domestic service within the scope of the Act. The Hackney Committee asn for instructions to be issued to all Employment Exchanges so that, in future, no womad applicant, whose normal occupation is other than domestic service, shall be disqualifiee from receiving benefit on the ground of refusal to accept a domestic vacancy. The committee call attention to the case of a dressmaker or embroiderer, who requires to take great care of her hands, and who would be seriously handicapped in her own trade, if during a time of trade depression she had been obliged to take rough work.JUVENILE BRANCH.Apprenticeship: Distributive Trades. An indenture of apprenticeship has been drawn up by the Kingston-on-Thames Juvenile Advisory Committee for use in the distributive trades. Since the inception of the Trades Boards, employers are compelled to pay at least the wages laid down, irrespective of Avhether the boy or girl is an indentured apprentice or not. As some branches of the distributive trades are now covered by Trade Boards, this has led to the insertion of a clause in the indenture that the employer shall pay to the apprentice wages, either at the rate fixed by a Trade Board set up for the trade, or at the rates set out in a schedule attached, whichever rate be the higher.Agriculture.-The Doncaster Juvenile Advisory Committee have recently been considering the possibility of establishing a definite scheme for training boys in agriculture, and local farmers are to be invited to discuss this question with the committee. A copy of the memorandum on this subject, which has been circulated to all Juvenile Employment Committees, is to be sent to the Medical Officer of Health, with a request that he should notify the committee when it is desirable for a boy leaving school to have employment in the open air.[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment and Insurance Department will also be found on pages 18, 19, 35 and 36.] &apos;Employment and Insurance Department continued.Whilst there is still severe unemployment in the West Midlands Division, certain Exchanges report that the situation appears less gloomy ; Birmingham state that the live register has decreased and the number of vacancies notified and filled has risen.There is increased depression, rather than any improvement, in the general industrial situation in London. General factory workers are everywhere unemployed, and there is no prospect of their absorption in the near future.In Scotland there is anticipation of a trade revival, at the end of the coal dispute, in the textile and ancilliary trades. A number of thread workers have started work again at Barrhead, where a firm have adopted oil fuel, but the trade is very depressed at Paisley. At Dunfermline linen factories are on short time, and cotton-spinning factories are closed at Airdrie. The opening of the season in the Highlands is reported from Inverness, and hotel managers are notifying many orders.
APPOINTMENTS AND TRAINING.APPOINTMENTS  AND  CIVIL  LIABILITIES  DEPARTMENT.APPOINTMENTS.    .Statistics. During the week ending the 25th June the department placed 331 candidates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 56,450. Of these, 7,277 have been placed through the agency of the departments Interviewing Boards. Applications were registered from 571 ex-service men and 29 civilians. The number of candidates available for appointments on the , 25th June was 11,777 ex-service men and 1,318 civilians. At the same date 791 &quot; live &quot; vacancies were at the.disposal of the department, 335 having been registered during the week.BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.Business Training Scheme. During the week ending the 25th June, the department received one application for training under this scheme, bringing the total, number of applications to 3,296. Of these, 1,936 have since been cancelled, and grants have been sanctioned in 845 cases. At the same date, 154 training vacancies were at the disposal of the department, five having been registered during the week.  &apos;Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The department have dealt with a total of 1,247 cases, in 556 of which the training sanctioned is provided by the Appointments Department, and in the remainder by other Government departments. Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed their training in 355 cases, and abandoned training in 47 ; 125 are still in training, and 29 are awaiting training.TRAINING  DEPARTMENT. INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and other. Ex-Service Men.Statistics. On the 28th June 23,598 men were in training, as against 23,633 on the 21st June, and 24,039 on the 31st May. During the week, 443 men were placed in training. There were 16,790 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 21st June and the 31st May being 16,725 and 16,698. The number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 34,610; the totals for the 21st June and the 31st May being 34,132 and 32,801. Of the men in training 19 per cent, are in the building trade and 12 per cent, in the furniture trade. Tailoring and vehicle-building account for approximately 10 per cent, and 8 per cent., respectively, of the total.Elementary Teachers. The scheme for training men as trained certificated manual instructors is progressing satisfactorily. There is now no difficulty in securing men for this course. Although the Hornsey Training College is not yet open, the full number of trainees has been obtained, and the college at Erith is in a similar &quot;position. The arrangements for the actual opening of both these colleges are now in a very advanced stage. Several communications have already been received from education authorities&quot; inquiring when the men will be available for employment.*Government Instructional Factories. The number of men in training in Government -Instructional Factories is nowll,I90, which shows an increase of 37 during the week.The training centre at Bolton Road, Pendleton, has now been taken over as an annexe, of the City Hall Factory, Manchester. After the 31st August, when the &quot;City.Hall will, be relinquished, the Bolton Road centre will be administered from the Ayres Road Factory.
Appointments and Training-continued.Training has ceased at the small Government Instructional Factory at Colwyn Bay, and the premises were vacated on the 23rd June. The trainees have been transferred to the Government Instructional Factory, Wrexham. At the Loughborough Factory, where there are now over 560 men in training, principally in engineering, rural handicrafts and the vehicle-building and furniture trades, sales during May amounted to upwards of  700, and there were contracts in hand at the end of the month to the value of over  2,200.Exhibitions. Arrangements are being made by the manager of the Whitehall Road Factory, Leeds, where nearly 200 men are in training in the various processes of the building, vehicle-building and furniture trades, to exhibit specimens of work from nearly all the classes at the Yorkshire Agricultural Show, which is to be held at Roundhay, Leeds, on the 20th July.National Trade Advisory Committees: Tailoring. At a meeting on the 28th June? the resignation of the Glasgow Local Technical Advisory Committee was fully discussed ; two members of the National Committee are to talk the matter over with the Chairman of the Glasgow Local Technical Advisory Committee at the next Trade Board meeting.Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics. Up to the 29th June, agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 46,498 apprentices, under the 41 schemes approved. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 44,343 apprentices, employed by 17,636 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 27,301.Wages. Messrs. Bruce, Peebles &amp; Co., Ltd., Edinburgh, engineers, have reduced the wages of apprentices undor the scheme to that of the ordinary fifth-year apprentice, for the balance of the apprenticeship period remaining to be served under the scheme after the termination of State assistance. The local secretary of the employers&apos; association stated that the matter was to be discussed at their next meeting and, at his suggestion, a statement was made in explanation of the scheme. In all probability the facts will be placed before the federation in London, as other firms in Edinburgh are interested in the decision. Local headquarters consider that, were it not for the continued depression in trade, firms would not demur in making these payments.Unemployment. Messrs. McKie &amp; Baxter, Govan, engineers, have applied for an extension of the period of State assistance where time has been lost by 13 of their apprentices under the scheme. Messrs W. P. Griffith &amp; Sons, Ltd., London, printers, are making a similar claim.Messrs. Leighton, Son &amp; Hodge, London, bookbinders, had originally decided not to submit claims for State assistance, but the recent depression in trade has caused them to reconsider the matter.Institutional Training. Negotiations for the establishment of the engineering class at the Kilmarnock Technical School have for the moment been suspended on account of the threatened stoppage in the engineering industry.*General Training. /Apprenticeship: Building. The first meeting of the Apprenticeship Committee for Rugby was held on the 10th June. It was decided that the industry should be exclusively represented on the committee, and that representatives of other bodies, in ah advisory capacity, should be called in as the need arose. The various points of the scheme were discussed in their relation to local conditions; as regards the indenture, it would be necessary to include the area rules already in operation.A joint conference of employers and operatives has taken place at Ashton-under-Lyne.
