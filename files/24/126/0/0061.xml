Phis Document is the Properly oj His Britannic Majesty^ Government.I Co^g^kial Use Only.Vol. IV., No. 4.    23.7.21.THE LABOUR SITUATION.Week ending the 19th July, 1921Prepared by Intelligence Division, Ministry of Labour.Contents.General Survey of the Week Features of the Weekpage45 46Negotiations and Disputes Statistical Appendixpage48GENERAL  SURVEY  OF  THE  WEEK.The genera] movement towards wages redactions over large groups of occupations continues, but there is no event to record this week comparable with the events of last week in the engineering and. shipbuilding industries. Workers in the printing trades, agricultural workers, and dock labourers, are the most important groups affected at the moment, but definite progress has been made in the week only as regards the dockers. In their case, an immediate reduction in the minimum wage fixed by Lord Shaw&apos;s Court of Inquiry in March, 1920, has been agreed upon, subject to confirmation by the men.*Having regard to the number of workers affected, disputes in coal mines are again prominent in the list of disputes in progress. A resumption of the working; of the ordinary conciliation machinery in South Wales, and the first meeting of the wages board set up by the recent national agreement, both of which are expected in the coming week, should ease the situation. Prospects of employment in the cotton textile industry in Lancashire, and in the textile and clothing industries of Yorkshire are reported to be showing marked improvement; as a contrast, the reports on the Sheffield iron and steel and engineering and allied trades continue to be gloomy. The estimated total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 15th July was 2,020,300, being just a little more than that of the 13th May, at the end of the sixth week of the coal dispute.The annual meetings of the General Federation of Trade Unions and of the National Union of Dock and Eiverside and General Workers have been held during the week. The latter conference may be compared with that of the National Union of Railwaymen, in that the keenest debate arose on the conduct of the general secretary : and Mr. Sexton, like Mr. Thomas, received a vote of confidence. The General Federation of Trade Unions definitely acknowledged their severance from the International Federation .of Trade Unions ; the proposal for an international congress of English-speaking trade unionists shows, however, that the General Federation are not willing,to resign to the Trades Union Congress all international business on behalf of British trade unionists.The Minister of Health&apos;s statement, in the House of Commons on the 14th July, on the Government^ housing policy, and what may be the final meeting, on the 19th July, of the Provisional Joint Committee appointed by the National Industrial Conference in 1919, are both events of outstanding importance in the post-war history of Labour.* See Footnote t page 49 below,(34198-31) Wt.74-BB 600 7/21 H.St, 99/3
FEATURES  OF THE  WEEK.General Topics.Corn Production Acts (Repeal) Bill. This Bill has been considered by the StandingCommittee of the House of Commons, and, on the 14th July, there was a discussion of clause 4, which proposes the establishment of voluntary joint councils of employers and workmen in agriculture.   These committees are to take the place of the agricultural wages Board and the District Wages Committees.   An amendment was moved limiting the duties of the new bodies to the consideration of any difference or dispute as to wages,hours or conditions of employment &quot; so that no question about the fixing of wages shouldbe discussed by these bodies until a dispute had actually arisen.&quot;   The Minister for agriculture objected to this amendment on the ground that it was not advisable that thecommittees should only operate in cases of difference or dispute.   It was then suggestedthat the committees should not have power, in the first instance, to fix rates of wages, butthat they should have legal powers to enforce their awards.   The Standing Committeethen adjourned to consider this proposal and met again on the 19th July, when anagreement was reached, as follows : &quot; These new joint committees are to deal only with wages, hours and conditions. They can only act if employers and employed agree to remit the questions to them. They will not have general powers to fix wages in each district, but they need not wait for a dispute to arise before considering matters reported to them.&quot;The following addition to Clause 4 was also approved : &quot; If the Committee agree on an award such award shall be enforceable in the making of an Order by the Minister for Agriculture. If they do not agree they may appoint an independent chairman as arbitrator.Committees will be given the fullest powers to grant permits for employment of workers at a lower wage than the rate agreed upon in the district, owing to old age or unfitness.&quot;During the course of the discussion, the Minister stated that, in order that the Government might have the best expert advice and the greatest amount of help in assisting the industry to settle its own affairs and set up conciliation committees, it had been arranged that a branch should be set up in the Ministry of Agriculture devoted to that object, and that Mr. H. J. Wilson, of the Ministry of Labour, would temporarily take charge of the work.The dispute between the employers&apos; representatives of the Agricultural Wages Board and the appointed members of the Board, which resulted in the resignation of the employers&apos; representatives, has now been settled. The employers&apos; representatives have agreed to withdraw their resignations, and to attend the meeting to be held on the 21st July, when the question of an immediate reduction in wages will again be considered.A demonstration of agricultural workers was held at Northampton on the 17th July, under the auspices of the National Union of Agricultural Workers, when a resolution was passed protesting against &quot; the Governments failure to fulfil its pledges to the agricultural workers,&quot; and against the farmers&apos; attempts to reduce the workers&apos; standard of living.National Joint Industrial Conference. At a special meeting of the Provisional Joint Committee, on the 19th July, both the employers&apos; and the workers&apos; representatives* unanimously decided to send in their resignations, as it appeared that no good purpose could be served by the Conference remaining in being. The representatives have taken this action on the ground that the recommendations contained in their reports have not been given legislative effect, particularly those with regard to an 8-hour day and a minimum wage.    *Trade Boards Acts. On the 5th and 6th July, separate conferences, of chairmen of Trade Boards, of representatives of employers on the various Boards, and of representatives of the workers, respectively, were convened by the Minister of Labour for the selection of a Joint Standing Advisory Committee on Trade Boards, in accordance with the recom-mendations contained in the Report of the 4th March, 1921, of the Committee on the Administration of Trade Boards.The conference of chairmen appointed representatives for the committee, but the two other conferences intimated that they were not prepared to proceed with the formation of the committee until the Minister- had adopted certain other recommendations of the Trade Boards Administration Committee.Cotton Textile Industry. At a meeting of the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations, Ltd., on the 15th July, it was decided that the hours of working should* See this Report, Vol. 111., No. 26, 25th June, p. 514,
4723.7.2134198be increased from 24 to 55 a week in the American section, and from 35 to 48 in the Egyptian section. Short-time working has been in operation in the American section for seven, months, and in the Egyptian section for nine months.Industrial and Other Organisations.Trades Union Congress. At the last annual meeting of the Congress, held at Portsmouth in September, 1920, a proposal was put forward to establish a new General Council, to take the place of the present Parliamentary Committee, and to appoint a full-time chairman. A constitution for this new body has been drafted, and its adoption will be considered at the next annual meeting, to be held in September at Cardiff. The new council will be composed of 32 members, representing 18 trade groups. It will include women members, and its main function will be to keep a watch upon all industrial movements, and, whenever possible, to co-ordinate industrial action. It will also seek to promote common action by trade unionists on general questions, such as wages and hours of labour, and on any matter of general concern between trade unions and employers, or the Government. It is proposed that the council should have power to assist any union which is attacked on any vital question of trade union principle, and it is to support and endorse Parliamentary candidatures. The new chairman will be asked to give his full-time service to the business of the Congress, but the president will continue to be nominated, as hitherto, the position of the permanent chairman being in the nature of a vice-presidency.National Union of Railwaymen. An agreement has been concluded between the National Union of Bailwaymen and the London District Committee of the Electrical Trades Union, concerning electrical workers on railways. The agreement provides for the setting up of a Standing Joint Committee of the two unions, which is to carry on .negotiations concerning wages, working conditions and other matters affecting the electrical section of railway workers in the London district. With regard to membership, it is agreed that those who are at present members of either the Electrical Trades Union or the National Union ot Railwaymen shall remain in their respective organisation,.but, if they wish to transfer from one union to the other, the question will be considered by the Standing Joint Committee. Provision is made that all men engaged in the electrical section, not at present in any union, and all future employees in the electrical section, shall join either the National Union of Rail way men or the Electrical Trades Union. In the case of any industrial dispute, an undertaking is arrived at whereby both unions agree to notify each other before an actual withdrawal of labour takes place.Amalgamation of Unions. The working agreement which has been in force between the Associated Blacksmiths and Ironworkers&apos; Society, the Ship Constructors and Ship-wrights&apos; Association, and the United Society of Boiler Makers and Iron and Steel Ship Builders^ has now come to an end; and the question of the amalgamation of the societies is again being considered. A ballot vote of the boilermakers&apos; society showed a majority in favour of amalgamation, but the motion was defeated by the shipwrights&apos; society.The boilermakers&apos; and blacksmiths&apos; societies, therefore, are to hold a further ballot on the question of the amalgamation of these two unions, excluding the shipwrights&apos; society.National Union of Dock and Riverside and General Workers. The annual conference of this union was held at Aberdeen from the 12th to the 15th July. In welcoming the delegates, Mr. McQuade, the president, spoke of the grave and strenuous times through which the country had passed since their last conference. Transport workers, he said, had particularly felt die pinch of unemployment ; the efforts of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, which resulted in the minimum wage of 16s. a day, under Lord Shaw&apos;s award, had been largely nullified by lack of work.Mr. Sexton, M.P., general secretary of the union, severely criticised the Unemploy-ment Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1921, on the ground that, while it increased the contributions payable by dock workers, it was physically impossible for them to qualify for benefit.A resolution expressing the opinion &quot;that the payment of high wages to trade union officials has not been justified, and that the wage of the General Secretary shall not, in future, exceed  la week more than the maximum paid to branch secretaries&quot; was
2S.7.2L 48Features of the Week-continued.proposed. In this connection, a circular from the National Workers&apos; Committee (Dickers&apos; Section, Liverpool), had been circulated amongst the delegates. This circular demanded the dismissal of Mr. Sexton on tho ground that he had betrayed the working class by not supporting the miners, by treacherously encouraging his members to handle blackleg coal, and by not submitting the question of wage reductions to his members. It also alleged that he was unable to serve the interests of the union owing to his many other occupations. After a heated discussion, in which Mr. Sexton vigorously defended himself, the resolution was defeated by !02 votes to It.The closing features of the session included a strong condemnation of the Emergency Powers Act, and a call for drastic measures to deal with unemployment. The other proceedings of the conference were in private.General Federation of Trade Unions. The annual conference of this Federation was held in the University College, Bangor, on the 14th and 15th July. The chief subjects of discussion included a proposal to appoint two organisers, the published corres-pondence concerning the relation of the Federation to the International Federation of Trade Unions, and a motion calling for the resignation of Mr. Appleton, the general secretary of the Federation.Mr. Malialieu, secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Journeymen Felt Hatters, presided. In his address, he urged that the sane men in the trade union movement should assert themselves in negotiations ou industrial and commercial matters, and stated that it was their duty, whenever possible, to a,void industrial disputes which involved exhaus-tion of funds. He also asked that leaders, having been elected, should have more conli-dence placed in them.It was decided to appoint two organisers, at salaries of  GOO per annum, whose work would be to increase the membership of the Federation and collect information and statistics. In this connection, it may be noted that the present aggregate membership of the Federation is stated in the annual Report to be 1,5*3,0.58, as compared with 1,480,108 in 1920, and 711,994 in 1911. The reference in the Annual Report to the breaking of the connection with the International Federation of Trade Unions, &quot; on account of the failure of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress to observe either the letter or the spirit of its obligations,; was approved.^A resolution on the agenda, in the name of the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union, calling for the resignation of the general secretary, in view of his &apos;; many attacks upon sections of the Labour movement, and actions subversive of his office and the integrity of the Labour movement &quot; could not be proceeded&apos; with, as the union had sent no representative to move it.The conference adopted, without discussion, a proposal in the Annual Report to approach the trade unions of the English-speaking countries of the world, to discover whether they would be willing to take part in an international trades union congress of English-speaking peoples, for the unification of trade union policy in those countries whose institutions and democratic ideas are similar in character.The following were elected to the Committee of Management for the year : J. Asquith (Rochdale), Amalgamated Machine, Engine and Iron Grinders and Glaziers&apos; Society ; J. N. Bell (London), National Amalgamated Union of Labour; J. Cross (Black-burn), Amalgamated Weavers&apos; Association ; P. -Gillespie (Dundee), North of Scotland Hor.-e and Motormen&apos;s Association ; T. F. Richards (London), National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives ; A. Shaw (Bradford), National Society of Dyers and Finishers; A. Short, M.P.

Young (Leeds), United Garment Workers Union.NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Builders (National). It is understood that the National Wages and Conditions Council met on the 14th and loth July to discuss the application of a sliding scale based* It will be remembered that the Trades Union Congress, at&apos;its meeting in Portsmouth in 1920, passed the following resolution That this Congress instructs the new Parliamentary Committee to take the necessary steps to determine that the British Trade Union movement shall be affiliated to the International Trade Union Federation only through the Trades Union Congress and its Parliamentary Committee, and directs the Parliamentary Committee to refrain from co-operating with any sectional body which can only claim to represent a comparatively small minority, most of whom are moreover affiliated to this Congress.&quot;
4923.7.21on the cost of living to the national building trade. A.s no decision could be arrived at in regard to the period over which the average of the cost of living should be taken, it was agreed to refer the question to arbitration.Dock Labourers (National). It will bo remembered that a meeting of the National Joint Council for Dock Labour, which was held on the 29th June to discuss the proposed reduction in wages, was adjourned until a date to be fixed.* A meeting of the Joint Sub-Committee of the Council was held on the 1.1th July, when certain proposals were made by the employers which the workers&apos; representatives were unable to accept without taking the opinion of their constituent bodies. As a result, however, of private confer -ences between the negotiating; committees of both sides, it has now been agreed thatii. .there shall be an immediate reduction of 2s. per day, with a further Is. per day reduction on the 1st January, 1.922. This will mean that the minimum wage of 16s. per day for clock labourers, adopted as the result of Lord Shaw&apos;s Court of Inquiry, will be reduced forthwith to 14s. per day, with a further reduction to 13s. per day in January. The proposed arrangement is subject to ratification by a national delegate conference of all the unions concerned, which is to be held in London on the 20th July.!Road Transport Workers (Manchester and District). The Amalgamated Horse and Motor Owners&apos; Association, representing employers in the transport industry in the Manchester, Stockport, Ashton and Warrington districts, recently issued a circular advising their members to put into operation a working week of 18 hours, exclusive of meal times, and stable or garage duties. The arrangement that had obtained previously provided for an inclusive week of 48 hours. The new arrangement was put into force in the Manchester district on the 4th July, but, after a week&apos;s trial, the carters employed by the Manchester Corporation, who are organised in the United Road Transport Workers&apos; Association and the United Vehicle Workers, struck work. A conference was held on the 11th July between the unions and the employers concerned, at which it was decided to cancel the new arrangement, pending further negotiations. The carters thereupon resumed work on the same day. A further joint meeting is expected to be held about the 19th July.Printing Employees (National). It will be remembered that with regard to the proposed reductions of 15s. per week for men and 5s. 6d. per week for women employed in the printing industry, no decision had been reached up to the 28th June, as to whether the Printing and Kindred Trades &quot;Federation should negotiate for the whole group of trade unions concerned. J It has now been decided, however, that the Federation shall negotiate for all sections, except those represented by the Typographical Association, and the lithographers.Negotiations were resumed on the 14th July between representatives of the Federation of Master Printers and the Printing and Kindred Trades Federation, when the employers modified their demands so that the reduction in the case of men should take place in three instalments of 5s. each on the pay-days in the weeks ending the 6th August, the 3rd September, and the 1st October; the reductions for women to be 2s., 2s., and Is. Qd., respectively, with corresponding reductions for learners and piece-workers. The Printing and Kindred Trades Federation submitted a printed statement explaining their opposition to wage reductions in general, and intimated that a further communication would be sent to the employers on the 22nd July.The employers also met the executive of the Typographical Association on the 14th July, but the proceedings resulted in a deadlock. Both disputes will be considered by the Joint Industrial Council, who are to meet on the 26th July.Envelope and M anufacmred Stationery Employees.-The adjourned wages negotiations were resumed at a further meeting; of the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee for this industry on the 11th July, when the proposed wages reductions of 10s. for men, 7s. for women in London, and 5s. for women in the provinces, were again considered. $ After considerable discussion, the employers put forward modified demands, to the effect that half of the reductions should come into force for the week ending the 30th July^ a quarter for the week ending the 27th August, and a quarter for the week ending the 24th September. The reduction in the case of women in London was amended to 5s., on the Understanding that a committee should be set up to consider the whole question of the wages of these women.* See this Report, Vol. IV., No. 2, 9th July, p. 22.f The national delegate conference and the National Joint Council have now ratified the proposed reductions.t See this Report, Vol. IV., No. 2, 9th July, p. 29. I See this Report, Vol. IV., No. 2, 9th July, p. 27.
23.7,2150The trade union representatives agreed to place these proposals before their executive, but no undertaking to recommend them for acceptance was given. A definite reply from the union is expected by the 26th July.*Strikes and Lock-Outs.Co-operative Insurance Society Employees (National). A strike of district managers, agents and district office clerks employed throughout the country by the Co-operative Insurance Society, Ltd., Manchester,, took place on the 14th July, on account of the alleged victimisation of a trade union official. It is understood that one of the district managers of the society is also honorary secretary of the District Managers&apos; Fraternal Association, which is affiliated to the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers. In consequence of this managers refusal to obey an order issued from the head office of the society, he was dismissed, and the union claim that this dismissal amounts to victimisation. The Society, on the other hand, state that the dismissal was necessary in order to maintain discipline. The union state that 3,000 workers are affected, but the Society dispute this figure, stating that at least 2,000 spare-time agents have been included by the union.Settlements and Agreements.Beating and Domestic Engineers (National). The ballot vote of the members of the National Union of Heating and Domestic Engineers on the Joint recommendation for reductions of wages, mentioned in last week&apos;s issue of this Report, has resulted in the acceptance of the reductions by&apos;a large majority.Plumbers (South Wales). The Cardiff master builders, with the plumbers employed by them, recently agreed on a rate of 2s. 2\d. per hour. The operative plumbers normally employed by master plumbers, however, were not prepared to accept similar terms from the master plumbers. They were anxious to submit the case to arbitration, and to argue their case for preferential rates as compared with the building trade mechanics.At a joint meeting on the 9th July, however, a provisional settlement was reached, and the men agreed to return to work on the 11th July at 2s.- 2\d. per hour, with retrospective payment from the 4th June for periods worked since that date. The master plumbers, on their part, have agreed that the whole matter of rates of wages shall be referred to arbitration.Ship Repairers (Bristol Channel). As a result of negotiations between the Bristol Channel Dry. Dock Owners and Ship Repairers&apos; Federation and the trade unions concerned, the plumbers, joiners, painters, electricians and woodcutting machinists have accepted by ballot vote a reduction of 7s. per week in the existing war wage of 35s. per week, to take place in two instalments, 8s. as from the 1st August, and 4s. as from the 1st October. It is understood that the Amalgamated Engineering Union have recommended the smiths&apos; hammermen to take a ballot vote on the question of accepting similar reductions. In the case of the shipwrights and boilermakers, who are piece-workers, it has been agreed to recommend the men to vote in favour of the acceptance of a reduction of 9s. &apos;6d. per week from the existing war wage of 30s. fid., the reduction to take place in two equal instalments on the 1st August, and the. 1st October.Engineers (National). The second ballot vote of the men on the terms of the proposed settlement^ has resulted in their acceptance by 175,145 votes to 108,969. The figures of the individual unions are as follows : Fur. Against.Amalgamated Engineering Union   ............   71,862 63,624, Societies affiliated to the Federation of Engineering and shipbuilding Trades      ...............  43,016 21,394National Union of Foundry Workers.......... 17,989 5,241Societies affiliated to the National Federation of general works    .....................  42,278 18,710In accordance with the agreement, from the I5ih July, wages of time-workers will be reduced by 3s. per week and wages of piece-workers by 1\ per cent. ; further similar reductions will be effected as from the 15th August.   In September, the parties will meet* See this Report, Vol. IV., No. 1, 2nd July, p. 4.

Following on negotiations between the Laminated Spring Manufacturers&apos; Association and the Associated Blacksmiths&apos; Society, an agreement has been arrived at for a reduction in wages of 8s. per week from the flat war bonus of 426&apos;., as from the 1st July. It was further agreed to regulate wages according to a sliding scale, whereby a reduction of Is. will be made for a complete 6 points fall in the cost-of-living index number, beginning at 119 points.Woollen Textile Workers (Scot/and). It. will be remembered that negotiations have been taking place between representatives of the employers and workpeople in the South of Scotland woollen textile industry regarding wage reductions, and that both parties agreed to refer the matter in dispute to the Industrial Court.* The Court sat in Glasgow on the 7th July, and have now issued their award (No. 671). This provides that the increases granted under Award No. 404 shall be reduced, for time-workers, from 38s. to 32s. for a full ordinary week, in the case of men, and from 28s. to 245. for a full ordinary week, in the case of women ; for piece-workers, the addition to schedule rates is to be reduced from 145 per cent, to 120 per cent., and the addition to flat statements from 120 per cent, to 100 per cent.The new rates are to be paid as from the beginning of the first pay period which follows the 30th June, and are not to be varied before the 31st December. The award also provides that two months notice in writing of any proposed variation shall be given by either side.Coal Trimmers (National). It is reported in the Press that, as a result of negotiations which took place on the 14th July in London between representatives of the shipping employers and the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, an agreement was arrived at involving a reduction of 10 per cent, in the wages of coal trimmers, to operate as from the 1st August.jElectricity Supply Employees. The National Joint Industrial Council for this industry met on the 11th July, and unanimously agreed to recommend a national wages reduction in the following terms : From the 15th July, the wages of all classes of employees, whose wages are regulated by the various district schedules to be reduced by 3s. per week, and by a further 3s. per week as from the 16th September; where consolidation of wages has taken place, the respective amounts to be 3s. tyd., that is, 3s. plus 12^ per cent.; no further alteration of wages to take place for a period of four months from the 15th July.This recommendation is applicable only to those undertakings which have carried out the awards and agreements for increases of wages.&quot;Waterworks Undertakings (Midlands). The Midland Area Joint Industrial Council for Waterworks Undertakings met in Birmingham on the 8th July, when it was agreed to adopt the recommendations of the National Council,! the proposed reductions to come into operation on the pay-day in the week ending the 21st July.
