Once again, therefore, the most acute problem in the coal-mining industry is unemploy-meht, and. there are signs that the miners&apos; unions wish to put into operation the special unemployment fund scheme which had been prepared and approved just before the opening of the recent dispute. The settlement of the series of local coal disputes also means that the shipyard joiners&apos; strike is restored to its position as the most important dispute, numerically, in progress.The general movement towards wages reductions over large groups of occupa-tions continues. The most important events in the past week of this nature have been in connection with the printers, but the movement is now being definitely ex-tended to wholesale distributive occupations in London, and to co-operative em-ployees generally. A revision of the wages and conditions of road transport workers is taking place all over the country.The United Textile Factory Workers&apos; Association and the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation have held their annual conferences during the week. The former con-. ferenoe has again discussed the question of closer organisation of the unions in the cotton textile industry, while the most striking event at the latter was perhaps the resolution in favour of urging the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain to affiliate and actively to identify themselves with the Third International. A conference of building guild committees has also been held in Manchester with the object of unify-ing the building guild movement, which has hitherto worked from two centres, London and Manchester.The Corn Production Acts (Repeal) Bill passed through report stage and third reading in the House of Commons on the 25th July. The changes made in Clause 4 are dealt with below.The estimated total of the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 22nd July was 1,870.000, being approximately the same as that of the 29th April, at the end of the fourth week of the coal dispute, tlnem-plOyment Insurance and Employment Exchange statistics for the 15th July are given in the statistical appendix.(34250-31) Wt.74-B5 600 7/21 H.St.s-99/3
FEATURES  OF  THE  WEEK.General Topics.Corn Production Acts (Repeal) Bill. This Bill, as amended by the Standing Committee of the House of Commons, was considered by the House on the 25th July, read for the third time and passed. During the discussion further amendments of the Bill were suggested and adopted. Paragraph (c) of Clause 1 was amended as follows : &quot; The body of persons constituted with respect to any area by the Board of Agriculture for Scotland under Sub-section (2) of Section 11 of the Corn Production Act, 1917, shall, notwithstanding this repeal, continue to exercise the powers and duties of the Agricultural Committees for that area under the Agriculture Act, 1920, unless and until the Board of Agriculture for Scotland by order direct that such powers and duties shall be exercised by the Board, which direction they are hereby authorised and empowered to give, and the Board shall thereafter have power to constitute an agricultural committee for that area.&quot;Clause 4, which provides for the establishment of voluntary joint councils of employers and workmen in agriculture, received several amendments. The Minister of Agriculture pointed out that throughout the olause, and in the title of the Bill, the words &quot; council &quot; and &quot; committee &quot; were used to denote the machinery to be set up to deal with the wages problem, and he proposed that the word &quot; council &quot; should no longer be used. This proposal was agreed to, as also was a proposal by the Minister to insert a new paragraph after paragraph (2) as follows,: &quot; The organisation representing employers or workmen by whom any member of any such committee as aforesaid was nominated or appointed (whether before or after the commencement of this Act) may at any time appoint another person to be a member of the committee in place of that existing member, and thereupon the existing member shall vacate office.&quot;It was decided to leave out paragraph (5) of Clause 4, which deals with the question of payment of wages at a less rate than that payable under the confirmed agreement arrived at by the Conciliation Committee, and to insert another providing that &quot; where any rate of wages has been agreed by a committee and been duly confirmed and advertised as aforesaid nothing in any agreement for the employment of a workman in agriculture shall operate to deprive the workman of his right to receive wages at that rate, except: &quot; (a) where the committee, or a sub-committee thereof, is satisfied that the agreement for payment of wages at a lower rate was, having regard to any special circumstances affecting the workman or to the special terms of the agreement, fair and reasonable, and issues a certificate accordingly ; or&quot; (&amp;) where, on an application made for such a certificate, the committee or sub-committee have failed to agree with respect to the matter, and the court in which proceedings are taken for the recovery of wages at the rate agreed by the committee is so satisfied as aforesaid, and then only to the extent to which the committee or sub-committee certifies, or the court determines, that the wages payable to the workman should be at some lower rate than the rate so agreed by the committee.&quot;It was also agreed that Scotland should be exempt from the operation of the clause, with the exception of sub-section (1) which gives power to the Minister of Agriculture in England and Wales and the Board of Agriculture for Scotland to form voluntary conciliation committees.The final arrangements for dealing with the wages question differ very consider-ably from those originally proposed. In the first instance, the Bill provided for the formation of voluntary joint conciliation committees, but these had no legal powers of any kind. The present arrangements provide for the setting up of conciliation committees which partake of the characteristics of both Trade Boards and &quot; Whitley&quot; councils. These committees are to be set up by counties or by smaller areas, and are to consist of an equal number of representatives of the two sides. There will be no central committee, and no appointed members to act as umpires between the two sides, who will have to come to agreements as to rates of washes, hours of employment and conditions generally. These agreements will be enforceable by law, and decisions are to be registered at the Ministry.Mining Industry Act. The executive of the Miners&apos; Federation, subject to the approval of the districts, have decided to accept and work Part II. of the Mining Industry Act, 1920. This provides for the regulation of coal mines under &quot; pit &quot; and &quot; district &quot; committees, and under &quot; area &quot; and &quot; national &quot; boards.  Hitherto
the miners have declined to participate in the operation of these provisions, which would have ceased to have effect next month had the miners not revised their original decision.Industrial and Other Organisations.National Building Guild. A national conference of building guild committees was held in the Memorial Hall, Manchester, on the 23rd July, when the amalgamation of the London Guild of Builders with the Building Guild, to be known as the National Building Guild, Ltd., was effected. Under the new constitution there will be a National Board as a supreme governing body, which will be elected from regional councils, chosen upon a representative basis from local guild committees. Guild committees will have power to enter into contracts to the extent of  500, and regional councils to the extent of  2,000; but, beyond that, the National Board, the body ulti-mately responsible for finance, must give their sanction. The maximum-sum con-tract has now been agreed upon, in lieu of the original form of guild contract, on account of objections to the latter from the Ministry of Health.The chairman, Mr. Harry Frankland, in summarising the work of the guild, stated there are now 115 guild committees. They had completed  300,000 worth of work, and were prepared to capture control of the whole building industry and to contract for any job in any part of the British Isles. Mr. S. G. Hobson, secretary of the guild, said that other trades were taking up the guild idea, and that the emergency committee of the Building Trades Federation had been favourably im-pressed with guild work.The conference passed a resolution condemning the Governments repudiation of their pledge to abolish slums, and calling upon the Government to reconsider the stopping of housing schemes and Government grants.Amalgamated Engineering Union. The headquarters of this union in Peckham Road were seized by London members, numbering about 200, on the 18th July. The seizure was the outcome of meetings of members of the union held the previous Sunday at Willesden, Cricklewood and Chiswick. A delegation, which included the communists, Mr. W. McLaine, Mr. W. Harrington, and Mr. S. G. R. Bowler, secretary of the West London Workers&apos; Committee, saw the members of the executive, who were in session, and requested them to leave. A provisional committee was then formed, and a circular sent out to all branches of the union inviting them to send a delegate at once to a special conference to consider the situation. The explanation of, and justification for, this militant procedure is said to be &quot; the arbitrary action of the executive in cancelling the supplementary out-of-work benefit in order to force their members to vote an acceptance of the wage-cuts recently negotiated by them.&quot;The provisional committee did not, however, remain in possession for long. They left on the following day, when the police, at the request of the executive committee, came to eject them.South Wales Miners&apos; Federation. The annual conference of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation was held at Cardiff on the 22nd and 23rd July; 216 delegates, representing 152,500 members, were present, and Mr. Enoch Morrell presided.The chairman, in opening the conference, spoke of the difficulties which had arisen after the resumption of work at the collieries. He thought some disputes were due to a genuine misunderstanding as to the correct interpretation to be placed upon the terms of settlement, but he stated that there were others where the terms were wilfully misinterpreted in order to enforce new conditions. The general secretary, the Rt. Hon. Tom Richards, also stated that the workers were much in-censed because employers sought to impose conditions of employment and rates of wages which were foreign to the national agreement.Resolutions were passed in favour of amendments to the Coal Mines Act with regard to greater freedom for checkweighmen, and the appointment of firemen in collieries by the State, and demanding that house coal, free or at privileged rates, should be supplied to injured or unemployed workmen, and the widows of deceased workmen.A resolution was adopted that a recommendation be made to all lodges that employed workmen should be asked to give 5 per cent, of their earnings for the34250 A o
30.7.2156maintenance of those out of work, and another resolution expressing the view that the position of president of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain should be &quot; an annual part-time appointment,&quot; was also agreed to. The conference also decided, by 120 votes to 63, in favour of urging the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain to affiliate and actively to identify itself with the Third International.Messrs. J. Winstone, T. Richards, Noah Ablett and A. J. Cook were re-elected as representatives of the Federation on f/he executive committee of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain.United Textile Factory Workers&apos; Association. The annual conference of this association opened at Blackpool on the 25th July. Mr. W. Gee presided, and in his address referred to the slump in the cotton industry, and drew attention to the fact that cotton firms had continued to pay large dividends right up to the time when the recent wages negotiations began. He did not regard the settlement obtained as satisfactory, but looked upon it as the best that could be obtained in the circum-stances. He also emphasised the need for funds, which would enable the operatives to carry their struggles to a successful issue, and remarked that the day of excessive benefits and small contributions was over.Resolutions were adopted advocating the amendment of the Workmen&apos;s Com-pensation Act and the Factory Acts. In the former case, payment of compensation from the day of the accident, and the fixing of the weekly allowance at not less than 75 per cent. fof the ordinary wages paid for a full working week, were advocated; and, in the latter case, a demand was put forward that fines or deductions from wages should be made illegal.A resolution was also adopted in favour of contracting out of the Government, unemployment scheme, and of the raising of a joint fund, to which the employers would contribute three-fourths and the operatives one-fourth, and which would be administered by a board consisting of an equal number of employers and operatives.On the second day, resolutions were passed protesting against the increase of the duty on cotton goods imported into India from 7J to 11 per cent., and demanding an inquiry into the fiscal relations of India and this country; approving of the recommendations for international labour legislation adopted at the International Labour Conference at Washington, in November, 1919, and urging the Government to fulfil their obligations by legislation.A resolution advocating the formation of a federation of cotton workers&apos; amalgamations was referred to the Legislative Council for further consideration. During the discussion on this resolution it was pointed out that the cotton industry was the best possible field for amalgamation, as not only were all the workers in one industry but they dealt with one set of employers.Mr. W. Gee (card and blowing-room operatives) was elected president, Mr. E. Duxbury (loom overlookers), vice-president, and Mr. J. Cross, secretary, for the ensuing year.NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Agricultural Workers (England and Wales). The* Agricultural Wages Board met on the 21st July, and recommended reductions in wages of 6s. and is. per week, according to the district concerned, with a minimum wage of 42s. The recommenda-tion is being referred to the District Committees, and the next meeting, of the Board is to be held on the 23rd August.Road Transport Workers (Manchester, Penzance and Dundee). It will be remembered that the Amalgamated Horse and Motor Owners&apos; Association put into operation in Manchester a working week of 48 hours, exclusive of meal times and stable or garage duties, and that, after a week&apos;s trial of the scheme, the carters . employed by the Manchester Corporation struck work, but subsequently resumed, pending negotiations. A meeting of the representatives of the, unions and the employers concerned was held on the 20th July, when the workers intimated that they could not, in any circumstances, agree to an increase in the number of working
See this Report Vol. IV, No. 4, 23rd July, p. 49.hours. The employers suggested that a sliding scale of wages should be discussed, but this the unions refused to consider until the employers had withdrawn their demand for an increase in working time. No decision has been arrived at, and the matter has apparently been left to the discretion of individual employers.It is reported that the wages of carters at Penzance have been reduced by 3s. a week as from the 1st July.It is reported in the Press that, owing to the continued fall in the cost of living, the wages of the Dundee Corporation carters were reduced by a further 2s. 6^. per week as from the 2nd July.Printing Employees (National). A conference was held in London on the 25th July, between the Federation of Master Printers and Allied Trades, the Newspaper Society and the Printing anc[ Kindred Trades Federation, when negotiations on the proposed wages reductions were resumed.^ The conference was successful in reaching an agreement to recommend the following terms to their respective organisations&quot;That a reduction in wages of 5s. per week from the wagts paid to all adult male members of unions affiliated to the Printing and Kindred Trades Federation for whom the Federation were empowered to negotiate, shall take effect on the pay-day in the week ending August .13, and a farther 5s. per week reduction on the pay-day in the week ending September 10.&quot; For all fully-qualified women workers, it was decided that a reduction of 2s. per week be made on the pay-day in the week ending August 13, with a further reduction of Is. Gd. per week on the pay-day in the week ending September 10; also a corresponding adjustment of the wages scale to the male learners and junior women workers, and also piece-workers.&quot;The Amalgamated Society of Lithographic Printers, the Typographical Associa-tion, the London Society of Compositors and the National Society of Electrotypers, Stereotypers and Assistants were not represented at this conference. At a meeting of the Joint Industrial Council for the Printing and Allied Trades, the position of these unions was discussed, and a resolution was passed unanimously recommending the parties to resume negotiations; it was provisionally agreed that a meeting should take place on the 3rd August.Flint Glass Workers (National). Representatives of the British Flint Glass Manufacturers&apos; Association met representatives of the British [Flint Class Makers&apos; Society on the 18th July to discuss the employers&apos; proposal for a reduction of wages.-The union offered to accept a reduction of 10%d. &quot; per turn,&quot; while the employers in-sisted on a minimum reduction of Is. &quot; per turn.&quot; It was eventually agreed to sub-mit the matter to the members of the union.Textile Warehouse Workers (London). The Wholesale Textile Association have put forward proposals involving reductions in wages ranging from 2s. to 13s. per week, and entailing an average reduction of 10 per cent, for men and 15 per cent, for women. The unions concerned, namely, the textile section of the National Amal-gamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks, and the wholesale warehouse workers organised in the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers, met separately in London on the 21st July, when the proposed reductions were rejected. Representatives of both unions met the Labour Council of the Whole-sale Textile Association on. the 22nd July, and the employers modified their terms to the extent of allowing the present agreement to remain in force until the 1st Septem-ber, and offering smaller reductions to women of 22 and 23 years of age. The revised terms are to be submitted to the members of the respective unions for consideration.Co-operative Wholesale Employees (National). It is reported that the Co-opera-tive Wholesale Society are about to submit to the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers proposals for a reduction of 10 per cent, in the wages of their employees. This reduction is to take place at once, and to be followed by a further reduction of 10 per cent, in September.Co-operative Employees, Retail Societies (Various Districts). It is reported that negotiations are proceeding in the North-Western Area concerning proposals to revert to the wages scale in operation in 1919, with an addition of 4s. a week in the case of adult males, and 2s. a week in the case of adult females, no&apos; addition to the 1919 rates being paid to juniors. These proposals have been submitted to the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers with a request for a reply before
the 25th July. It is considered unlikely that the terms will be accepted by the union, and, if a deadlock arises, the Co-operative Union, Ltd., intend to submit the case to the Joint Committee of Trade Unionists and Co-operators which was appointed to deal with disputes between co-operative societies and their trade unionist employees.In the London Area, the West London Co-operative Society notified the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks in June that they intended to terminate the agreement made last September, and, as the parties could not come to an agreement, the society intimated that the proposed reduction would come into operation on the 2nd July. The union thereupon referred the matter to the Joint Committee of Trade Unionists and Co-operators referred to above.Settlements and Agreements.Coal Miners (National). A joint meeting of the Central Committee of the Mining Association and the Executive Committee of the Miners&apos; Federation was held in London on the 21st July, for the purpose of constituting the National Wages Board for the Coal Mining Industry, in accordance with the terms of the recent settlement. * Mr. Evan Williams and Mr. Herbert Smith were appointed president and vice-president respectively for the ensuing 12 months, and Mr. Frank Hodges and Mr. W. A. Lee were appointed joint secretaries. The Board will consist of 46 members, owners and miners being represented in equal numbers. Rules of pro-cedure were agreed on; they include provision for the appointment by the Lord Chief J ustice of an independent chairman to preside over the meetings when called upon.The Board considered the procedure to be adopted for the determination of &quot; costs of production &quot; in connection with the ascertainment of wages, and lit was decided to refer the matter to two firms of accountants, one nominated by each side, who are to present a joint report to the Board on the 28th July.With regard to the establishment of District Boards, also provided for in the settlement, meetings were held at Cardiff on the 19th July, and at Derby on the 22nd July. In the latter case, the Eastern District Board was set up, covering Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Cannock Chase and Warwickshire. The Board consists of 16 members on each side, and Mr. Herbert Smith has been appointed vice-chairman.At the meeting at Cardiff, the South Wales and Monmouthshire District Board was set up, and it has been agreed to graft the new Board on to the existing con-ciliation machinery. A sub-committee consisting of the solicitors for the ^owners and workmen, together with the chairman and secretaries of both sides, will prepare the necessary alterations, so that the revised conciliation agreement shall Conform with the terms of the national settlement. It was also agreed to set up a.joint com-mittee to deal &quot; with disputes arising out of the terms of settlement, such disputes to relate only to those collieries at which there has been a resumption of work.&quot;Bakers (Birmingham and District). An agreement has been reached between the Birmingham and Midlands Federation of Master Bakers, the co-operative societies, and the operative bakers, whereby the wages of journeymen are to be reduced by 4s. per week on and from the 16th July, and by a further 3.?. per week on and from the 13th August, and for the operation thereafter of a sliding scale under which there will be a variation of 2s. 4d. per week for every 10 points rise or fall in the cost of living, beginning from an index number of 120. For each night worked, Is. extra is to be paid. This agreement applies to Birmingham and the Midlands, and 20 towns are affected.Iron and Steel Wire Workers. An agreement has been reached between the &apos; Iron and Steel Wire Manufacturers&apos; Association and the Amalgamated Wire Drawers&apos; Society, for the withdrawal of the two advances in wages of 1\ per cent, granted in 1920, in two instalments, the first from the 15th July and the second from the 15th August.   The reduction applies to datal workers as well as to piece-workers.* See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 1, 2nd July, p. 6.
* See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 2, 9th July, p. 24. t See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 2, 9th July, p. 25.Sawmillers (Birmingham). An agreement has been reached between the Bir-mingham and District Timber Merchants&apos; Association and the Workers&apos; Union, by which the second reduction of l\d. per hour proposed by the employers^ has been spread over a period of three months; \d. per hour will be deducted on the 15th August, and two similar reductions at intervals of four weeks.Brass Foundry Workers (National)^Following on negotiations between the Northern Employers&apos; Brass Founders&apos; Association and the National Society of Brass and Metal Mechanics, an agreement was reached on the 14th July for a reduction of 35. per week in the case of time-workers, and 1\ per cent, in the case of piece-workers, to take effect on the pay week following the 15th July. A second similar reduction will come into effect on the 12th August.Brewery Workers (Yorkshire). At a conference held in Leeds on the 13th July, between representatives of the Yorkshire Brewers&apos; Association and the National Amalgamated Union of Labour, the National Union of General Workers, the Workers&apos; Union, and the Amalgamated Association of Carters and Motormen, it was agreed that the 7s. advance granted in October, 1920, should be reduced by four-sevenths on the first pay day in September. The unions are to be-given until 31st August to place before their members further proposals for a reduction of three-sevenths on the first pay-day in November. If both proposals are accepted, no further change is to be made before the 31st December, 1921.
