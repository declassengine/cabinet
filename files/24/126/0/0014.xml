(This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty1 government cabinet,secret  3U7P73T14, FRESCOES - FOREIGN OFFICE.Memorandum by the First Commissioner of Works.I truat the Cabinet will agree to settle this controversy forthwith.     Two points only a^e outstanding, neither of them aesthetic.It is agreed that the Artist may exhibit his paintings in situ, and at his own expense.    He wishes to fix them by the gumming process - Lord Curzon by means of wooden stretchers.     This being so, it seems essential that the Artist should use the method which he claims will. show his pictures to the best advantage.     I offer no opinion on the technical merits of either process, my contention being that, as we reserve our rights to reject en bloc, we should provoke criticism if the Painter were forbidden to do full justice to his work.The further issue of assessing the merits of the Cartoons when in situ is much more difficult.     Mr.Goetze suggests that if the. Cabinet doubts the suitability of the Cartoons, a Committee, should be appointed consisting of the P.R.A., as Chairman, together with four Painters, nominated by him, who are experts in mural decoration.     In other words, should the Cabinet be averse from accepting the paintings, a Court of Appeal can ensure reconsideration, or perhaps alter the decision.I fancy the procedure should be reversed, namely that a Committee should be formed upon rather broader lines than suggested, for mural decoration aa such scarcely exhausts the problem, and that having prepared a report (which may not be unanimous), the Cabinet should take theresponsibility
responsibility of saying &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;.      If it declines, redecoration of the walls will be involved - Borne  500, which is already overdue; - and I think the Cabinet should likewise express to the Artist sincere regret at its inability to accept the gift, which represents long and self-sacrificing work prompted by a public spirit which deserves high praise,8th July, 1921.ELMa Office of Works, Westminster,S,W.l.
