II. EMERGENCY WORK.As announced by the Prime Minister on the 19th October, certain schemes have been put in hand by the Local Authorities in conjunction with the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Health, and by the Local Authorities themselves, designed to secure work for unemployed men, preferentially ex-Service men. The following is the result at this date: (a.) New Arterial Roads.21,415 men employed up to date (in and around London, 2,572; Provinces, 18,843).(b.) Road Maintenance.It is estimated that employment has been provided for approximately 20,000 men over and above those ordinarily so employed.(c.) Housing (Acceleration of the Lay-Out of Roads and Sewers and Approved Housing Schemes).Men employed up to the 20th May, 4,368 (in and around London, 504; Provinces, 3,864).(d.) Lord St. Davids&apos; Committee.Men employed on work other than the above up to the 20th May, 33,547 (in and around London, 5,899; Provinces, 27,648).(e.) Alternative Work in Government Establishments.War Office establishments: men employed up to the 21st May, 2,733 (in and around London, 2,058; Provinces. 675).Alternative work provided in Admiralty establishments: men employed up to the 21st May, 6,171 (in and around London, nil; Provinces, 6,171).(f.) Short-time in Government Establishments.Number of men who have found employment up to date as a result of the intro-. duction of short-time system. Men employed up to the 21st May : War Office estab-lishments, 2,121 (in and around London, 1,931; Provinces, 190); Admiralty estab-lishments, 3,881 (in and around London. 206; Provinces, 3,675).(g.) Office of Works Emergency Programme.The special Emergency Programme of decorating and repair work in Govern-ment Departments by the Office of Works is now completed.[6335]GENERAL.The continuance of the coal dispute prevents any trade revival, but it is stated that as soon as supplies of fuel are available an expansion of business may be expected. Several iron and steel firms in the Midlands are understood to have a large number of orders in hand which will enable them to resume full-time working when coal is available. The stagnation in the shipbuilding trade continues, although some improvement in ship-repairing is reported, more especially at Liverpool, where certain shipowners are adapting their vessels to the use of oil as fuel. The depression in the textile and clothing trades continues, but it is believed that there will be a considerable revival when the coal dispute terminates. Although the lack of fuel is also handicapping the boot and shoe trade, many of the larger firms are able to work three or four days per week. The glass and porcelain industries are practically at a standstill, and, unless fuel can be obtained very shortly, they will be forced to close down entirely. The severe depression in the chemical and dyestuffs trade continues, and short-time is beings increasingly adopted by the railway companies throughout the country.
As reports for the week ended the 20th May have been received from only 369 Local Authorities out of 409 who were asked to furnish information, it is probable that the Relief Schemes which have been inaugurated by the Government and Local Authorities are finding employment for a number of men in excess of the figures given.III. 50,000 EX-SERVICE MEN TO BE TRAINED IN THE BUILDINGINDUSTRY.The Employers&apos; Associations are taking steps to set up throughout the country the District Committees which are to be established to select applicants and allocate them to the trades in which they can be trained most suitably. The number of applications received to date totals 16,027. In the London and. South-Eastern Division 7,099 men have applied, and the following are figures for other divisions: South Midlands and Eastern Counties, 1,023; South-Western Counties, 1,328; West Midlands, 1,569; Yorkshire and East Midlands, 1,487; North-Western Counties, 2,128; Northern Division, 390; Scotland, 833; Wales, 170.Only a few applicants have so far been actually.accepted under the scheme.IY.
