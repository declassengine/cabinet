GENERAL.A substantial increase in unemployment is again reported. This is due, almost entirely, to the shortage of fuel supplies consequent upon the coal dispute. Unemployment is likely to increase rapidly within the next week or two unless a settlement is reached. Fresh discharges have taken place from ironworks in the North of England and Scotland, and engineering firms are finding increased difficulty in carrying on their work. The shortage of coal has also resulted in the closing down of a large number of brickworks, while unemployment has increased considerably among pottery and glass workers. The shipyards are not materially affected by the coal shortage, but they have very little work in hand. The position in the textile trades remains unchanged, but a number of firms in the hosiery trade have been compelled to make further restrictions in their working hours. Although increasing orders are being received in the cotton trade the shortage of fuel prevents any considerable expansion of business. There is still some improvement in the boot trade at Northampton.II. EMERGENCY WORK.As announced by the Prime Minister on the 19th October, certain schemes have been put in hand by the Local Authorities in conjunction with the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Health, and by the Local Authorities themselves, designed to secure work for unemployed men, preferentially ex-Service men. The following is the result at this date : (a.) New Arterial Roads.20,398 men employed up to date (in and around London, 2.294; Provinces, 18,104).(b.) Road Maintenance.        *It is estimated that employment has been provided for approximately 20,000 men over and above those ordinarily so employed.(c.) Housing (Acceleration of the Lay-Out of Roads and Seivers and Approved Housing Schemes).Men employed up to date, 3,707 (in and around London. 506; Provinces, 3,201).(d.) Lord St. Davids&apos; Committee.Men employed on work other than the above up to date, 30,960 (in and around London, 6,163; Provinces, 24,797).(e.) Alternative Work in Government Establishments.War Office establishments: men employed up to date, 2,815 (in and around London, 1,994; Provinces, 821).Alternative work provided in Admiralty establishments: men employed up to date, 5,876 (in and around London, nil; Provinces, 5,876).(f.) Short-time in Government Establishments.Number of men who have found employment up to date as a result of the intro-duction of short-time system. Men employed up to date : War Office establishments, 2,323 (in and around London, 2,126; Provinces, 197) ; Admiralty establishments, 4,734 (in and around London, 208; Provinces, 4,526).(g.) Office of Works Emergency Programme.Total number of men employed at the present time as a result of the bringing forward of decorating and repair work in Government Departments by the Office of Works is 333 (in and around London, 93; Provinces, 240).&quot;6217]
1. The following statement represents the position as shown by the Exchange registers on the 29th April: -	Men.	Women.	Total.Numbers wholly unemployed Numbers on short time*	1,260,589 494,350	448,324 481,344	1,708,913 975,694Total......	1,754,939	929,668	2,684,6072. As a result of the operation of the Act of the 3rd March, 1921 (and of the grant of Out-of-Work Donation to ex-Service men and women), the following work-people are in receipt of Unemployment Benefit or Out-of-Work Donation : 				Men.	Women.	&apos;    Total.Wholly unemployed (estimated) On short time*	1,195,417 494,350	415,347 481,344	1,610.764 975,694Total......	1,689,767	896,691	2,586,458N.B. The above are advance figures in all cases.* There is no record of the number of workpeople on short time, who are not eligible to receive Unemployment Insurance or Out-of-work Donation, i.e., those who are employed in such a way that they are unable to comply witli the rules as to continuity of unemployment.(h.) Emergency Work found by Local Authorities.Total number of men employed up to date, 7,970 (in and around London, 2.791; Provinces, 5,179).(i.) Housing.On tbe 1st April there were 63,230 skilled men employed on housing schemes in England and Wales (in and around London. 11,053; Provinces, 52,177), and also 56,151 unskilled men (in and around London, 11,638; Provinces, 44,513). (The additional labour still required was 9,690 skilled men and 484 unskilled.)Total labour employed on above schemes = 218,497.As reports for the week ended the 29th April have been received from only 345 Local Authorities out of 399 who were asked to furnish information, it is probable that the Relief Schemes which have been inaugurated by the Government and Local Authorities are finding employment for a number of men in excess of the figures given.III. 50,000 EX-SERVICE MEN TO BE TRAINED IN THE BUILDINGINDUSTRY.The Employers&apos; Associations are taking steps to set up throughout the country the District Committees which are to he established to select applicants and allocate them to the trades in which they can be trained most suitably. The number of applications received to date totals 11,557. In the London and South-Eastern Division 5,589 men have applied, and the following are figures for other divisions: South Midlands and Eastern Counties, 743; South-Western Counties, 808; West Midlands, 907; Yorkshire and East Midlands, 1,082; North-Western Counties, 1,487; Northern Division, 236; Scotland, 596; Wales, 109.   &apos;&apos;Only a few applicants have so far been actually accepted under the scheme, and some time must elapse before the District Committees can complete their work of selecting and allocating candidates.IV.  PAYMENT OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT AND OUT-OF-WORKDONATION.
