[This Document is tho Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] Printed for the use of the Cabinet.   May 1921.SECRET. fti&quot;&quot; q.......-............&apos;...........&quot;................1CP. 2929.CABINET.FORESTRY EXPENDITURE.Memorandum Prepared by Forestry Commission for Submission to the Cabinet.THE Forestry Comniission have the honour to request that, in terms of the Treasury letter of the 17th December, 1920 (Appendix I), dealing with &quot; Restrictiou of public expenditure,&quot; they may be allowed to submit to the Cabinet certain ques-tions of principle affecting the finance and administration of the Forestry Act, 1919. As instructed in that letter, they enclose copies of the relative correspondence with the Treasury (Appendix II).The Forestry Commission require 400,000/. per annum for the remainder of the ten-year period covered by the Forestry Act to carry out the work with which they have been charged. This sum is available out of the Parliamentary Grant, but the Treasury have decided to reduce this sum in each of the vears 1922-23 and 1923-24 by 200,000/.The position the Forestry Commissioners take up is as follows : 1. That a ten-year programme of forestry development has been drawn up by the Reconstruction Forestry Sub-Committee (1917), considered and approved by a Sub-Committee of the Cabinet (1918), accepted by the Cabinet (1918) and approved by the Houses of Parliament in August 1919 (vide Sir Arthur Griffith-Boscawen&apos;s speech in the House of Com-mons, Official Report of the 5th August, 1919, p. 88).2. That to carry out3the authorised ten-year programme Parliament has voted a block grant of 3^ million pounds.3. That within the limits imposed by the block grant the Forestry Commission are charged with the duty of carrying out the authorised programme.From the correspondence enclosed it would appear that the Treasury consider 1. That there is no definite obligation on the part of the Forestry Commission to carry out the authorised forestry programme, or any &quot; specified scheme &apos;&apos; of forestry development.2. That all forestry operations begun after December 1920 are new operations, whether they come under the authorised programme or not, and as such have to be individually approved of by the Treasury.3. That the block grant voted by Parliament need only be provided in such instalments as the Treasury recommend to&apos; Parliament, and that the whole of the 3J million pounds voted for the ten-year programme are not necessarily earmarked for the ten years for which the money was voted.4. That they propose to advise Parliament to cut down the annual grant, certainly for the years 1922-23, 1923-24, and possibly for a longer period, to 200,000/. per annum, a reduction of 50 per cent, in the annual sum available for the Commission under the block grant.In considering this question, the Commission beg to bring the following points to the CabineVs notice : 1. The whole object of creating a Forestry Fund was to enable the Forestry Commission to carry out with the least possible disturbance a definite forestry programme, approved in advance -by the Government and Parliament.[6246] . B
2. That in pursuance of this idea the Forestry Commission have, at considerable expense and with the full consent of tne Treasury, perfected an elaborate organisation and entered into commitments to carry out the authorised programme.3. The reduction suggested is not a large sum (200,000/. per annum for two years), but if made at this stage (as will be seen from the enclosed diagram) (Appendix III) it will reduce the planting programme in 1922-23 from 11,100 acres to 3,000 acres and 1923-24 from 14,800 acres to 2,000 acres.If the Treasury decision is adhered io, the Commission will be left in the position of having to 1. Employ a whole-time technical staff to undertake 15 per cent, of the work for which they were appointed.   *2. Lose much of the value of the preparatory work already undertaken for the next three years&apos; planting programme&apos;.      :3. Plant only a very small proportion of the seedlings and transplants (exceed-ing 150,000,000) at present in their nurseries; burn or dispose of the remainder at loss, and simultaneously lay down another but very much increased stock of seedlings to meet the planting programme which would then have to be concentrated in the last three to five years covered by the block grant.In conclusion the Forestry Commission beg to put forward the three reasons why the national forestry policy should be carried out in full: 1. The Forestry Commissioners claim to have gone a considerable way to prove that State forestry can be carried out with success in the United Kingdom. They have acquired land at a cheaper rate than was antici-pated in 1916; the cost of their planting operations compares favourably with that of private landowners. They have carried out the duties for which they were appointed, including the whole of the acquisition and planting programmes laid down by the Reconstruction Forestry Sub-Committee, From the experience gained in the first two seasons&apos; work they are in a position to state that in spite of the rise of costs since 1916, given a free hand and power to effect economy in non-essentials, they can carry out the greater part, if not the whole, of the authorised programme, although they will not be in a position to make adequate preparation for the second decennial period of State forestry. In 1923-24 they will plant as much land as the whole of the landowners of the United Kingdom used to plant in an average year before the war, while by 1927-28 the rate of planting should be-nearly doubled.2. The staff have been appointed and much of the capital expenditure has already been incurred for the next three years&apos; work. At a time when new schemes many of which are not economical are being started for the relief of the unemployed, it does not appear to be wise to scrap a scheme of real benefit to the State, and one in which practically the whole of the residual assets can be spent in wages.3. The forestry position in Great Britain is in a much more unsatisfactory position to-day than it was when the Reconstruction Sub-Committee reported in 1916-17. At that time it was calculated that the neglect of forestry in Great Britain and the consequent failure to produce an important portion of its timber required in war had already cost the country 37 million pounds.In the year 1920 the imports of wood and pulp were practically the same as in 1913-14, but the cost to the country had risen from 40 million pounds to just over 120 millions. No doubt much of this increase was due to the rise in world&apos;s prices. It is fair however to argue that, given effective competition from the home timber trade, prices would have been lower while a large proportion of the purchase money would have been spent at home.The points which the Forestry Commission wish to submit to the Cabinet for decision are whether the two fundamental principles on which forestry development
has been based are to stand, viz., (a) a definite and progressive programme of work over a ten-year period; (b) a block grant to finance that programme. If these two principles are affirmed and the planting programme is to be regarded as a scheme already in operation, and not, therefore, to be now put in abeyance under the Treasury circular of the 17th December 1920, the Commissioners are prepared to meet the Treasury by making considerable reductions of expenditure in directions which do not render impossible a steady continuance of their work.Forestry Commission, 22, Grosvenor Gardens, S.W. 1,May 6, 1921.[6246]

It is an instruction, therefore, to all spending Departments that, except with fresh Cabinet authority, schemes involving expenditure not yet in operation are to remain in abeyance. This general principle applies to all spending Departments, but exception must be made, as I have already stated, for such temporary measures as are necessary to deal with the special problem of the unemployed,&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government regard it as of the first importance that immediate steps should be taken by Departments to carry into effect the above decision both as regards expenditure from the Exchequer and expenditure from rates.Their Lordships will be glad to be informed at your early convenience of the steps contemplated by your Department in pursuance of this policy, and at the same time to receive copies of any circulars issued, or about to be issued, by you to Local Authorities on the subject. So far as is consistent with statutory obligations, such Authorities should not, until the present financial stringency has relaxed and the serious trade depression with which we are threatened has passed away, be pressed by your Department to undertake expenditure involving a charge on the rates or indirectly on the Exchequer.Their Lordships would also wish to be informed what steps are being taken (a) to disband or transfer to other necessary work staff no longer required in view of the abandonment of schemes affected by the above decision, and (6) to wind up as early as possible any existing Committees whose enquiries will no longer be immediately needed. I am further to ask that Committees, the cost of which would fall upon public funds, should in future only be appointed if imperatively and immediately required, and that Their Lordships may be consulted beforehand if a Committee is likely to result in serious expenditure.In the event of your Department desiring to obtain fresh authority from the Cabinet the procedure will be in the first instance to communicate to the Treasury a full statement of the ground on which it is considered necessary to make such an exception, and upon receipt of Their Lordships&apos; reply the matter should be submitted, if desired, to the Cabinet, together with a copy of the correspondence between your Department and the Treasury.It is further requested that statements of any schemes which in the view of your Department come within the exceptions made for &quot; temporary measures necessary to deal with the special problem of the unemployed &quot; may be communicated as soon as possible to Their Lordships.Where any doubt arises as to the scope of the Cabinet decision the Treasury will be glad to be consulted.In conclusion, My Lords desire me to say that They count with confidence on the co-operation of all Public Departments in giving effect to the decision of Hie Majesty&apos;s Government.I am,Your obedient Servant,STANLEY BALDWIN.a [17.12.20] (38)13534(13209) Wt 31851-558  500. 1/21  B&amp;S

It is true that certain individual operations may be new in themselves but they are nevertheless part of a general scheme which has already received sanction.At the same time the Commissioners are complying with the spirit of the circular. For example, the Acland Report (to which the Forestry Act was the sequel) assumed that the area of 150,000 acres, which is to be afforested by the State in the first ten years of the scheme, would be provided as to J by purchase and as to $ by leasing. The Commissioners in order to reduce capital expenditure have decided for the present to reduce considerably the proportion of land acquired by purchase, although in some cases they have entered into purchase contracts where the land was particularly suitable and could not be otherwise obtained, or where it was for sale at bargain pricesYou will appreciate the difficulty of suddenly closing down an afforestation operation when I point out that the Commission now has in its seed beds and lining-out grounds the seedlings and transplants which will be used in the years up to 1924-25 inclusive, while the seed which will produce the plants for the forests in the subsequent year are now arriving at the nurseries. The area which the Commission is to plant increases yearly by some 3,300 acres and plants are provided accordingly. It is therefore obvious that if new afforestation units are not acquired and the partly-acquired units or &quot; forests &quot; are not completely acquired, there will be no ground in which to put the plants when raised and they will have to be scrapped; the scheme as a whole would consequently fail and expenditure which has already been incurred I would be wasted.With regard to additional afforestation, which would be new schemes, and work (in connection with afforestation) not immediately required, schemes prepared with a view to giving additional employment were submitted by the Commission to the Cabinet through the Ministry of Labour. These proposals would, of course, entail expenditure for which the Commission would require further funds.Yours sincerely, (Signed)       A. G. HERBERT.lb-)S. 4386.Sir, Treasury Chambers, March 4, 1921.I AM directed by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury to advert to their letter of the 19th November last (S. 4386) and previous correspondence, conveying their authority to the Forestry Commission to proceed within certain limits of expenditure with forestry operations under the provisions of the Forestry Act, 1919.As the Commission will be aware from the terms of Treasury circular of the 17th December last (No. 65/20) (to which no reply appears to have been received from your Department), the Cabinet has decided in view of the prevailing financial conditions that the time is not opportune for initiating or putting into operation schemes involving further expenditure from the Exchequer, and Departments bave[6246]- ... B 3
been instructed that, except with fresh Cabinet authority, schemes not yet in operation are to remain in abeyance.It is clear that the precise application of this instruction is a matter of difficulty, but it has been decided that the fullest possible effect shall be given to it, and, having regard to the policy which has been adopted in other similar cases, my Lords cannot therefore accept the view indicated semi-officially by your Depart-ment that the individual operations which form part of a general afforestation programme can be exempted from the Cabinet decision, on the ground that that programme has previously received approval.It is recognised that the method of carrying out the general rule in the case&apos; of forestry operations may require further consideration, and my Lords will be glad to be furnished at a very early date with detailed proposals by the Com-missioners for carrying the general policy into effect.In the meantime, however, my Lords think it desirable to indicate certain general principles which in their opinion should be kept in view. It is clear that the effectiveness of the Governments policy depends on the spirit in which it is carried out by the Commission. Due economy can only be secured if forestry opera-tions are so arranged during the next few years as to incur the least possible expenditure. My Lords are glad to learn that the Commission has made considerable reductions in the proportion of land acquired by purchase as compared with land acquired on lease. It appears however that the Commissioners contemplate the acquisition, by the two methods, of some 120,000 acres during the coming year. This amount should be reduced to an absolute minimum by confining fresh acquisitions to land urgently necessary to round-off an existing &quot; afforestation unit.&quot;With this exception, their Lordships consider that no fresh units should be acquired for the present.Capital expenditure on such objects as buildings and, roads should also be avoided wherever possible; and no fresh commitments should be undertaken for the present as regards forestry education or research or assistance to private owners by grants or otherwise, where schemes for these purposes are not already in operation.If this policy is rigorously carried out, my Lords consider that very considerable reductions should be effected in the estimates of the Commission for the coming year, particularly under the headings of acquisition of land by purchase or lease and cultural operations, without prejudice to any decisions which may hereafter be taken for the continuance and progress of afforestation when more favourable financial circumstances prevail.Pending consideration of the proposals of the Commission for carrying the fore-going principles into effect, their Lordships request that the general authority con-veyed by the letter from this Department of the 6th December, 1919 (49646/19) for the acquisition of land for afforestation or for incidental purposes, whether by purchase or lease, may be regarded as suspended for the present.The programme of the Commissioners for the purchase of seed and the provision of plants will require modification accordingly and my Lords will be glad to be informed what policy the Commissioners propose to adopt in this respect.I am, &amp;c. (Signed)        G. L. BARSTOW.The Secretary, Forestry Commission.(c.)Forestry Commission, 1531/20. 22, Grosvenor Gardens, S.W. 1.,Sir, . March 7, 1921.I AM directed by the Forestry Commissioners to advert to Sir George Barstow&apos;s letter of the 4th March (S. 4386), and to state that the Commissioners are reconsider-ing their annual estimates for the financial year 1921-22 with a view to an early reply. In the meantime I am to take this1 opportunity of stating the Commissioners&apos; position, and to ask for further guidance on certain points.The position of the Forestry Commission appears to differ from that of other Government Departments in that they have been given a definite task to accomplish in the first ten years of their existence, and that Parliament have directed that a definite sum of money shall be paid into the Forestry Fund for the accomplishment of that task. The reasons for adopting this unusual procedure are stated on pp. 62-63 of the Report of the Forestry Sub-Committee, Cd. 8881. where emphasis is laid on the necessity of a Forest Authority knowing with a considerable degree of
-certainty what funds it will have to administer. &apos;&apos; An Authority, like the trees, must have a chance of striking a deep root, and must therefore be able to plan its work for some years ahead with a certainty that it will have funds to carry it out.&quot; the forestry Commissioners have accepted the programme of the Forestry Sub-Committee which entails steady acquisition of land by lease and purchase year by year and a rapidly expanding planting programme, and although it was evident that the estimates made in 1916 of the cost of the scheme were far too low, in view of increased costs of labour and materials, the Commissioners nevertheless are attempting to carry out the original scheme by economy in working. Of necessity, however, their staffing and other arrangements have been based on an expanding planting programme, and the first effect of retarding the acquisition and planting programmes would be to increase materially the proportion of overhead and non-effective charges. As regards acquisitions they have found it is possible to secure better and cheaper land than was originally thought possible a state of affairs which they believe will not continue indefinitely.With reference to the fifth paragraph of Sir George Barstow&apos;s letter, the Commissioners desire to state that it is their wish to carry out the Governments policy in an effective way. They find it difficult however to agree with the first general principle laid down in that paragraph that &quot; due economy can only be secured if forestry operations, are so&apos;arranged during the next few years as to incur the least possible expenditure.&quot; They could, for example, reduce their total expenditure to an amount not greatly exceeding their total commitments for staff, in which case no actual planting work would be done, no provision would be made for planting in the future, and the efficiency of their operations would be nil. - It is presumed that such is not the intention of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury.With regard to the proposal that fresh acquisitions of land should be confined to land urgently necessary to rounding off existing &quot;afforestation units,&quot; I am to state that the Commissioners have necessarily a number of probable acquisitions , in an advanced stage of negotiation, some of which it would be impossible to break off without loss of the confidence of the landowning class. The Commissioners believe that the success of their acquisition policy demonstrates that they possess that1 confidence to a considerable degree and further that if it were once lost it would not be easily regained. The Commissioners feel, also that the policv advocated in respect of buildings, education and research would have a similar effect on the success -of their operations as a whole.The Commissioners&apos; views on these questions may be summed up as follows: They feel that they are responsible for the execution of a scheme for a period of years, and that it is on the execution of that scheme as a whole that their effective-ness will be judged and probably the future of forestry in the United Kingdom will depend. They are therefore unwilling to do anything even for a single year which would be manifestly inefficient. Inefficiency is bound to result if they are prohibited from carrying out any one type of operation or of expanding in any given direction since the individual items of their programme are mutually dependent and should be modified only after a survey conducted from the technical point of view. They find it impossible also to submit a modified and effective scheme whether for plant production or for any other purpose where provision has to be made for several years in advance, unless there is a definite degree of certainty as to the funds which will be available. The Lords Commissioners of the Treasury have taken the view that the sum which it was proposed to ask Parliament to provide in 1921-22 (viz., 266,300/.) is too high. I am therefore to ask whether they are in a position to indicate to the Forestry Commissioners by what amount it should be reduced, and whether they would be prepared in agreeing to a reduced estimate to leave to the Forestry Commissioners the allocation of the amount sanctioned to the sub-heads which the latter consider would be most effective from the point of view of their operations as a whole.I am directed finally to emphasise the fact that foresight and careful attention of technical details are essential to successful forestry operations. In the simplest of these, viz.. in the provision of plants, seed bas to be sown of the correct species and in the correct amounts three to four years before land is planted. I am to request, there-fore, that their Lordships in considering the whole question will not overlook the technical, nature of the work.I am, &amp;c. (Signed)        A. G. HERBERT.Acting Secretary. ,The Secretary, Treasury, S.W. 1.
(d.)F. 2392.Sir, Treasury Chambers, March 7, 1921,I AM directed by the Lords Commissioners of His M.ajesty&apos;s Treasury to acquaint you for the information of the Forestry Commissioners that, subject to any alterations that may become necessary before its presentation to Parliament, my Lords have approved at a total of 200,000/. the estimate for 1921-22 for the Forestry Commission which accompanied the letter from your Department of the 8th January (1258/20).My Lords are of opinion that under present financial conditions the restriction of public expenditure must apply to some extent to the operations of the Forestry Commission, and a further letter is being addressed to you on this subject. They are not prepared to propose to Parliament a larger grant than 200,000/.The reduction of 66,300/. has been made provisionally by the excision of the proposed contribution of 2,500/. to the Imperial Forestry Bureau, to which their Lordships have not agreed, and by reduced provision for purchase of land, items 1 and 2 of sub-head (e), Forestry Operations, which have been amended to 60,000/. and 8,860/.Provision for bonus has been reduced from 34,285/. to 29,125/. in accordance with the decision communicated in the circular letter of the 10th ultimo (F.2143).I am, &amp;c. (Signed)        G. L. BARSTOW.The Secretary, Forestry Commission.S. 4386.Sir, Treasury Chambers, April 22, 1921.I HAVE laid-before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury Mr. Herbert&apos;s letter of the 7th ultimo (1531/20), relative to the policy to be adopted by the Forestry Commissioners in view of the Cabinet decision with regard to the restriction of public expenditure intimated in Treasury circular, No. 65/20, of the 17th December last.The Forestry Commissioners state that their position appears to differ from that of other Government Departments, in that they have been given a definite task to accomplish, and that a definite sum has been allocated by Parliament for the accomplishment of this task.Upon this, I am to observe that the Commissioners are not under any statutory obligation to carry out the precise scheme of afforestation recommended by the Forestry Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee or any other specified scheme. Section 8 (2) of the Forestry Act, 1919, provides that there shall be paid into the Forestry Fund during the ten years following the 1st April, 1919, thesum of 3,500,000/. in such annual amounts as Parliament may from time to time determine, together with all sums received from sales of land, timber, &amp;c. Within the limits of such provision as may be made available under this section it is the duty of the Commissioners under Section 3 of the Act to promote the interests of forestry, the development of afforestation and the production and supply of timber in the United Kingdom, subject to any directions which may be given by the Treasury as regards the matters specified in the section. No statutory obligation is imposed upon the Commissioners to observe any given rate of expenditure, or to expend the whole of the sum mentioned within the period of ten years.On the other hand, it is necessary for their Lordships in deciding what annual amounts Parliament shall be asked to provide for payment into the Forestry Fund in any particular years, to have regard to the general financial obligations of the Exchequer. The Commissioners are well aware of the financial difficulties of the present year. I am to say that, in view particularly of the cessation of the Excess Profits Duty and of the heavy maturing obligations on account of debt, these difficulties will be even more serious in 1922-23 and the succeeding year. It will be necessary in order to avoid fresh taxation to effect further reductions of expenditure as compared with the provision made in the estimates for the current year, and the Commissioners will recognise that the Forestry programme cannot be exempted from the limitations which must be imposed in the immediate future upon many reforms which are in themselves desirable.
My Lords recognise, however, the force of the Commissioners&apos; contention that the Forestry Authority must, for technical reasons, have a degree of certainty as to the funds which will be available over a period of years. So far as it is possible at the moment to judge, they would be prepared to ask Parliament to provide in 1922-23 the sum of 200,000/. as a grant-in-aid of the fund; being the amount provided for the current year, and a like sum in the succeeding year.In view of the general financial considerations mentioned above, my Lords consider that the provision, in each of the two years mentioned, of the same amount as is proposed to be voted in the current year is the utmost which they can undertake. The question whether in the immediately succeeding years it will be possible to increase the amount must depend upon circumstances which cannot yet be determined.Provided that the Commissioners: are willing to regulate their programme for the next few years on the foregoing basis, my Lords will be ready to sanction the allocation of the total amount provided to the sub-heads which are considered most effective, and to authorise the Commissioners to proceed with the acquisition and development of land within fixed limits of expenditure as heretofore, on the under-standing that the acreage acquired will be within the limits of such general programme as may be approved, and will not necessarily involve an increase of unavoidable expenditure in future years beyond the above-mentioned limits.If the Commissioners concur in the adoption of arrangements on these lines, their Lordships would be glad to receive their proposals for carrying them into effect with an estimate under main headings of the expenditure which would be incurred in the next three years. They will then proceed to deal with the specific purchases for which authority is sought in Mr. Herberfs letter of the 7th instant (41/21).My Lords are glad to note that in the case of recent acquisitions of land for afforestation the Commissioners have found it possible to secure^cheaper and better land than was originally thought possible. They would remind the Commissioners, however, that this fact cannot justify the acquisition,of land beyond the limits which can be dealt with in the near future, with the funds available for the purpose.I am to add that their Lordships would be glad to receive the schedules of expenditure asked for in their letter of the 19th November last, conveying a general authority for afforestation expenditure within certain limits.I am, &amp;c,I AM directed by the Forestry Commissioners to advert to Sir George Barstow&apos;s letter of the 22nd ultimo (No. S. 4386), relative to the restriction of expenditure on forestry operations, and to express regret that so great a difference of view exists on certain matters which the Commissioners regarded as definitely established principles of forestry procedure.I am to state that it had not occurred to the Commissioners to doubt that, within the limits imposed by the three and a half million block grant, it was their bounden duty to carry out the ten-year forestry development programme laid down by the Reconstruction Forestry Sub-Committee. That programme, after a full enquiry by a specially appointed sub-committee of the Cabinet, was definitely accepted by the Cabinet in 1918. It is true that it is not incorporated in the Forestry Act, 1919, but it is equally true that it was the main consideration which induced Parliament to pass that Act. As will be seen on p. 88 of the Official Report-of the 5th August, 1919, Sir Arthur Griffith-Boscawen, the Minister in charge of the Bill in the House of Commons, concluded a summary of recommendations of the Forestry Sub-Committee with the words &quot; that is the, proposal of the Reconstruction Sub-Committee, and that it is the proposal of the Bill.&quot;The second principle which the Commissioners believed to be firmly established was that the Forestry Fund had been voted by Parliament to meet the expenses of the programme which had been approved of by Parliament.(Signed)G. L. BARSTOW.The Secretary, Forestry Commission.1531/20. Sir,*
Secure, as they thought, in their programme and in their financial provision, the Commissioners have proceeded, with their Lordship&apos;s direct concurrence as far as staff is concerned, and their general approval as far as other expenditure is concerned, to complete the preparatory arrangements&apos; for undertaking a large and expanding volume of work. These arrangements include the appointment of Headquarters,&apos; Assistant Commissioners&apos; and Divisional Staffs, Technical Forest Officers (Divisional and District), practical foresters and foremen, They include grants to educational establishments, the creation of training centres for foresters and foremen, the acquisition of land, preparation of the land, creation of nurseries, the purchase of seed and the rearing of seedlings and transplants for the next three-to-four-years&apos; planting programme. This organisation cannot be scrapped at a momenfs notice without grave loss, nor if scrapped can it be quickly and efficiently reconstituted.It is only by using up during the current year the savings of over 200,000/. which have accumulated during the first two years of the Commissioners&apos; work, that it has been possible to accept the reduction in grant for the current financial year and still to carry out their programme.If the annual vote due to the Commission for the next two or more vears were reduced by some 50 per cent, as indicated by their Lordships&apos; letter of the i nd April, the programme for succeeding years would be placed out of gear and, on account of overhead charges and existing commitments, the amount available for effective forestry operations in the years 1922-23 and 1923-24 would be reduced by 85 per Cent., and by a still larger percentage if the reduction is continued.The Commissioners would consequently be left in the position of having to:  1. Employ a whole-time technical staff to undertake 15 per cent, of the work for which they were appointed.2. Lose much of the value of the preparatory work already undertaken for the next three years&apos; planting programme;3. Plant only a very small proportion of the seedlings and transplants (exceed-ing 150,000,000) at present in their nurseries; burn or dispose of the remainder at loss, and simultaneously lay down another but very much increased stock of seedlings to meet the planting programme which would then have to be concentrated in the last three to five years covered by the block grant.In the circumstances the Commissioners feel they have no alternative except to lay the matter before the Cabinet and to request a ruling on the two fundamental principles which have hitherto governed their procedure. They regret, therefore, that in view of their Lordships&apos; letter of the 22nd ultimo in reply to the Commission^ letter of the 7th March last, they feel compelled to take action under Mr. Stanley Baldwins letter F. 2355 of the 17th December; 1920 (No. 65/20).I am to state that the Commissioners trust that, pending the receipt of the Cabinet decision, their Lordships will not delay dealing with the specific acquisitions for which authority is sought by letter of the 7th ultimo (41/21). Negotiations have been proceeding for some time; the properties include some of the most desirable acquisitions the Commission have yet had on offer. It will be difficult to draw back from the negotiations now without losing the reputation for fair dealing and prompt decisions, which has enabled the Commission to acquire land up to date on such excellent terms. On the other hand, the Commissioners will undertake not to submit further proposals for acquisition until the decision of the Cabinet has been received.I am, &amp;c. (Signed)        A. G.
