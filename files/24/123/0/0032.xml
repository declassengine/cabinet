mil. Por^?ot 18 the Property ot., TIT.&apos; rritoiitiio iv)aiosty&apos;s Government) . .J 7*0INTBRKATIOHAL LABOUR CONFERENCE.RET -Prohibition of the Use of,White Lead in Painting.MEMORANDUM BY THE HQiiE SECRETARY.I have now had an opportunity of considering the statement of the case against the use of leadless paints which.Sir F. Baines, has, presented to the Offioe of Works and the substanco of which he laid before, the Home Affairs Committee at its last meeting.Before commenting on that statement, I must point out that the remarks made by Sir P. Baines at that meeting were the first indication whioh I or my Department received that any change of attitude on the part of the Offioe of Works had taken place;  Under the direction of Sir P. Baines&apos; predecessors, Sir H. Tanner and Hr. Pott, the Offioe of Works have been using leadless.. paints now for 14 years or more, and during that period kept my Department informed of the results obtained.)&quot; The evidenoe whioh Sir H. Tanner placed before the Home Offioe Committee in.1911 was confirmed by subsequent communications from tho Offioe of Works to the Hone Office whioh left no room for doubt as to tho attitude of the Office of TCorks at any rate up to last year.  At the beginning of last t year the Off ice. of Works prepared a memorandum on the subject which they suggested should.be issued by the Home Offioe and which opened with the statement ttIt is now 12 or 1*3 years since the Department (that is the Offioe of Works) decided to adopt non-poisonous paints for use on buildings in their charge, and the results have been satisfactory.   It is found that  paints prepared on a basis of zino, iron oxido etc with proper mediums.) afford quite as good proteotion to wood and iron work as points mixed on a lead base&quot;.   Again on the 23rd liarch last in reply to a request from the Home Offioe for the latest information, Sir P. Baines wrote &quot;the experience gained during the period since the date of the Committee^ inquiry is briefly that (a) for internal work, perfectly satisfactory results.can be obtained with non-poisonous paints, (b) for external work the non-poisonous are noi quite equal to the lead paints&quot;.   See copies of Home Offioe letter and Offioe bf Works reply. Ho further letter has. been reoeived by Home Offioe.   I oonfess I cannot understand either the suddenness of the ohange on the part of the Office of Works or their omission to give my Department, as the Department responsible for advising the Government on this subjeot, any indication that grounds existed for revising their previous opinions.I have very carefully considered what advioe I should give to Lili my colleagues, as the hinister responsible for dealing with the general question.I would remind them in the first place that the Government has before it the reports of two strong oommittees, on which representatives both of
employers and of workers sat, tho one dealing with housen?ajjttlng, the other vdth*boaoh and carriage painting.  Both Committees came, to. the sane conclusion (the former with one dissentient, the latter unanimously) to recommend the prohibition of the use of paints containing more than 6 per cent of a soluble lead oompound.   Up to 5 per cent, the continued use of lead was to-be permitted.Those conclusions were reached after exhaustive inquiries during whioh a great deal of evidenoe was token, and information obtained as to foreign practice and experience: and I must emphasize the fact that though the&apos;praotioe. and experience of the Office of Works were a very important part of the oaso before the Departmental Committee on house , Painting, there was a great body of other evidence before the Committee in favour of leadless paints,-The competence and impartiality of the House Painting pqmmittee have been challenged by the White Lead Vlanufaoturers who conducted a oampaign against the Committee while it was st^ll sitting:and, are; .. .. conducting the present campaign a^dnst. tfre- proposal for an International-OonVention on the subject:,,but the allegation is absurd.What is the evidence on which it is now suggested by the Offioe of Works that the Government should throw over the recommendations of the Departmental Committees?   It appears to consist of general opinions expressed by the department s District Surveyors, Clerks&apos; of Works and&quot; Painting Foremen in reply to a questionnaire issued by the Offioe of Works at the beginning of the present year.   Ho exact observations have apparently been kept, such as were kept in the early years when the Office of Works was first experimenting with leadless paints and &quot; formed the basis of the evidence placed by the Office of Works before the Departmental, Committees.&apos;  I do nol of course suggest that these general opinions are not of importance, but it is clear that the experience on. which they are based would have to be very carefully ^examined before they could be aooopted as conclusive, when set against the recommendations of the Committees,   It must not be lost sight of that during the war much of the leadless paint placed oh the market *&quot;&quot; ( n default of lead paint whioh oould not be obtained) was of very poor quality and this may invalidate experience based more particular- &apos; ly on painting work done in those years.   It is curious at any rate&apos; that though the Offioe of Works has been using leadless paints for exterior work for the last 14 years and during that poriod the&apos; ; paint must have been renewed more than onee, no suggestion that the experience with these paints was unfavourable has been made till the present year.    -As regards the medical aspect of the Question to whioh reference is made in the Offioe of Works report, I think it      *; &apos; -. suffioient to say that the Hedioal Inspeotor of Factories,. who is perhaps the greatest, authority on, questions-of industrial, disease, and especially lead poisoning, advises me that while painters may
suffer oooasionally from the turpentine In the paint, for example when&quot; painting in badly ventilated rooms, there is no evidenoe at all that turpentine oauses   Bymptons like those of lead paralysis, and none -so far as he knows-that it oan oause the conditions known as &quot;ohronio lead poisoning&quot;.Supposing the proposal for prohibition is abandoned - what are the alternatives?Regulation has been suggested, especially prohibition o-l ;j of dry rubbing down and burning off, medical examination of workers etot   The Committee, on House Painting carefully considered this suggestion and rejected it as impracticable in the peculiar, circumstances in whioh housepainting is carried on.   The&quot;, other Committee also rejected regulation unanimously, though in the case of oarriago painting whioh is carried on in faotories, regulations would be much more    practicable than in housepainting.How oan such a regulation as the prohibition of dry rubbing down be enforced in housepainting?   To attempt to enforce it by inspection would require an army of inspectors, and oven then it would be impossible to prevent men from dry rubbing down, whioh is muoh quicker and simpler, when there was no one around.     The oost of courso to the State or the local authorities or both of suoh inspection would be very large, unless indeed it was made a oondition of the use of lead paints that a lioence should be obtained from the local authority&apos;or the Factory Department^ and that a fee should bo paid sufficient to oover the oost of inspection, (if regulation has to be adopted in plaoe of prohibition., I should seriously suggest -the consideration of some suoh system.   It would furnish a strong inducement to master painters to use leadless paints.)    It is worth observing that the burden of the regulations will fall not on the White Lead iianufacturers who are conduoting the campaign, but on the Master Painters.I am not prepared, in view of the   -foregoing considerations, to reoommend the Government to adopt the conclusions suggested in Sir F. Baines1 report. &apos;On the other hand, it is obviously necessary, that the whole question must be further considered and the new evidenoe carefully sifted.   I gather from a letter I have reoeived.that it is already known in the outside world that the Offioo of Works has changed its views *The position is a difficult and unfortunate one, in view of the fact that the question is to be disoussed in a very short time by the International Labour Conferenoe8I have oome to the conclusion, though with great reluotanoe,. to reoommend -(a) that the Government should reply to the questionnaire of the
ICORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN HOiiE OFFICE AND OFFICE OF WORKS.HOME OFFICE, 1st March, 1921.414,357/2,Sir,I am directed by the Scoretary of State to refer to previous correspondence and to the evidence given by the Offioe of Works&quot;before the Departmental Committee appointed by the Home Offioe on the Bubjeot of the substitution of non-poisonous paints for lead paints in the painting of buildings.   The question of the prohibition of the.use of white lead in painting has been included among the subjects to be considered by the International Labour Conference to be held in :. Geneva this Autumn, and the Secretary of State desires to place before the Conference the most recent information as to the extent to whioh the use of non-poisonous substitutes has been adopted and the results obtained with such substitutes^   He would therefore be glad to know whether your Department are able to supplement in any respect the information on the subject already communicated to this Department and the Departmental Committee.   He would also be glad if you oould- International Labour Offioe by referring to the recommendations in the reports of the two Committees but stating that quite reoently further evidenoe has *been submitted as to the results of the use of leadless paints which appears to throw some doubt on the oonolusions arrived at, and that until this evidenoe has been oarofully examined, H.1I. Government regret they are not in a position to express anjl decided opinion as between prohibition and regulation,(b) that the Home Office should appoint a fresh committee to investigate the Offioe of Works1 experience and generally review the position.(o) that the British delegates at the Conference (assuming as is probable tliat no dooieivo recommendation is received from the Committee before the Conference meets at the end of Ootober) should neither support nor oppose prohibition, but that if prohibition is not carried but there is the neoessary majority in favour of a system of regulations-^ they should do their best to make these as effective and practicable as possible and should vote for them.. ... -B.
