PART L-THE LABOUR SITUATION.the general situation.General Survey of the Week.The situation in the coal mining industry remains unchanged, although the position is generally regarded as being rather more hopeful than a week ago. The threatened unofficial strike of railwaymen and transport workers on the 15th May did not materialise ; the decision of the executives of the National Union of Railwaymen and the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, on the 13th, to tighten the embargo on foreign coal and on all coal &quot; handled by blacklegs,&quot; no doubt had considerable influence on the men concerned. The position as regards sympathetic action may be said, therefore, to be somewhat easier than a week ago. Sympathetic action, however, once embarked on in whatever form, is apt at any time to have peculiar ramifications, and to lead to unlooked for consequences. This is illustrated by the dispute at the Greenwich Power Station referred to below, and by the ballot vote which is now being taken on the question of a sympathetic strike by the tramwaymen in the employment of the London County Council. Regarding this, however, it may be noted that the transport workers are reported to be divided and Mr. F. Hodges is understood to have expressed the opinion that action by the railwaymen and transport workers would not now be of much assistance to the miners, and might even injure their cause by making victimisation the issue of the day, and thus driving the miners&apos; dispute into the background.The negotiations with respect to the proposed: reductions in wages in the woollen textile, cotton textile, and engineering industries have continued during the week, but no agreements have been arrived at. Meanwhile the strikes by the electricians and ship stewards against such reductions continue. The unemployment situation growTs steadily worse, and many firms have closed down for an extended period during the holidays.The usual Whitsuntide trade union and other conferences, details of which are given below, have been held during the week. The rejection at the annual Co-operative Congress at Scarborough, by .1,686 votes to 1,682, of the proposed constitution for an alliance between the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party is of some interest. The result of this decision would appear to be that, although a formal alliance between the two bodies has been rejected, the Co-operative Party will continue to work on their original constitution, and actually in alliance with the Labour Party. Attention is also drawn to the ratification by an annual conference of the Union of Post Office Workers, at Edin-burgh, of the action of the executive in regard to a strike policy.The Labour Gazette cost-of-living index number for the 1st May was 128, as compared with 133 on the 1st April.The Unemployment Position.Statistics.-Q]i the 6th May, in the United Kingdom, 1,877,111 unemployment books under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and out-of-work donation policies, remained lodged for workers totally unemployed, of which 1,361,181 were lodged by males and 515,930 by females.- At the same date 1,106,313 unemployment books and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers on short time, of which 548,426 were lodged by males and 557,887 by females.These figures show an increase on the previous week of 77,666 totally unemployed and 28,995 working short time,The total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 13th May was .1,990,700. The above are advance figures provided by the Employ-ment Department and are subject to revision.A full analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 440.
features of the week.General Topics.Sympathetic Action by Trade Unions in Support of the Miners. The situation with regard to the embargo paced on imported coal by the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation threatened to become very serious during the week, but has now become easier, while the threat of an unofficial general strike, under the auspices of. the National Workers&apos; Committee, to take place on the 15th May, also failed to materialise.In connection with the attempt to organise an unofficial movement among railwaymen on lines similar to the unofficial movement in the mining industry, it is reported that the sub-committee appointed at the unofficial conference of members of the National Union of Railwaymen which was held at Cardiff on the 4th May, have now drafted a constitution for the organisation. The committee also met on the&quot; 12th May at Cardiff, apparently to discuss possible means of stimulating the rank and file to take more drastic action in support of the miners, regardless of any decision of the executive of the National Union of Railwaymen, but it does not appear that the movement has at present much hold over the men.The executives of the National Union of Railwaymen and the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation met separately during the week, and held a joint consultation on the 13th May. The meeting discussed methods of tightening the embargo on foreign coal, and the organisations concerned will co-operate in refusing to handle either imported coal, no matter for what purpose such coal is intended, or coal of any description, which has been handled by &quot; blackleg &quot; labour. It was also decided to request foreign transport workers to adhere to the resolution passed at the recent Congress of. the International Transport Workers&apos; Federation at Geneva imposing a blockade on coal for England, and to secure that the fullest possible effect be given thereto.The decisions taken at this joint meeting had the effect of averting, at the last moment, an unofficial strike of members of the Glasgow and West of Scotland District of the National Union of Railwaymen. This strike was to have taken place on the 13th May, to enforce the reinstatement of 12.men suspended by the Caledonian Railway Company for refusing to handle Welsh coal discharged at Prince&apos;s Dock, Glasgow, where the dockers are on strike. The position now appears to be that, as regards the docks, volunteer labour is being used while, on the railways, members of the National Union of Railwaymen are still available who are willing to handle coal. The executives of the National Union of Raihvaymen and of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation are continuing in touch with each other, but so far nothing very definite appears to have occurred as the result of the policy declared at their joint meeting on the 13th. Mr. Hodges is understood to have intimated that, in his opinion, the decision of the railwaymen and transport workers would not do much to help the miners&apos; case. He considers that, if there is a movement among these men owing to victimisation, then, in the eyes of the public, victimisation would become the principal issue and the miners&apos; dispute tend to sink into the background.A strike of members of the National Union of General Workers employed at the London County Council power station at Greenwich took place on the 14th May, in consequence of the introduction of foreign coal. The trouble originated in the refusal of the cranemen to unload Belgian coal which had been brought up the river. When this work was undertaken by volunteers from the clerical staff, the greater part of the remaining workpeople, who number altogether about 300, withdrew their labour in sympathy. The skilled men remained on duty, and volunteer labour was found to take the place of. the strikers. The men on strike appealed to the vehicle workers to refuse to drive or work on trams run by &quot; blackleg &quot; current, and it was finally decided to take a ballot of the whole of the London County Council tramwaymen on the question of withdrawing their labour in support of the power station men. The result of the ballot will probably be known on the 23rd May. At mass meetings of the tramwaymen held on the 15th May, a desire was expressed that all the members of the National Union of Vehicle Workers should be balloted on the question of a strike against the handling of foreign coal, or the use of any power generated from it, but no decision was reached on this point.A special meeting of the London Joint Advisory Council of Trade Unionists and Co-operators was held on the 10th May, to consider details of a scheme, which had already been drafted, for a Co-operative Relief Fund for the miners.  The Council decided
. * The Bill (H.C. 110), comprises 70 clauses and 6 schedules and takes up 67 pages. An explanatory memorandum, Cmd. 1292, has been issued outlining the policy of the Bill: the memorandum also contains the terms of the agreement of the 3rd May, 1921, between the railway companies and the three trade unions organising railwaymen, with regard to the machinery for the future regulation of wages and working conditions, which is the basis of Part IV of the Bill dealing with these matters. An outline of the policy proposed to be adopted with regard to railways was issued on the 28th June last year as a White Paper, Cmd. 787. (See also the Labour Gazette, July, 1920, p. 356.)f This movement for the amalgamation of the principal ex-Servicemen&apos;s organisations began in July last year. (See this Report, Vol. II, No. 4, 24th July, p. 135 ; Vol. II, No. 7,14th August, p. 236 ; Vol. II, No. 13, 25th September, p. 385 ; and Vol. II, No. 25,18th December, p. 680.)to endorse the scheme, and to request the National Advisory Council to secure national joint support for the scheme, and the addition .of a co-operative section to the joint committee, representing the Labour Party, the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress and the Parliamentary Labour Party, who are acting for the miners on behalf of these bodies.The draft scheme ensures that funds subscribed by co-operative societies shall be used to support co-operative trading in the mining areas. Grants from the funds of the co-operative societies will be made to co-operative societies in mining districts, and food vouchers of equivalent value will be sent to the officials of the miners&apos; lodges, and used to obtain food from the local societies.Railways Bill. A Bill was introduced under this title into the House of Commons on the 11th May by the Minister of Transport. The general purpose of the Bill* is to provide for the reorganisation of railways in Great Britain, and for their future regulation&apos; upon the expiry, on the 14th August next, of the Ministry of Transport Act, 1919, under which they are now controlled. The Bill proposes and provides for the amalgamation or absorption of the existing railway companies into six groups, under the supervision of an Amalgamation Tribunal of three commissioners named in the Bill.. The amalgama-tions are to take effect on the 1st January, 1923, but power is given to the Amalgamation Tribunal to postpone this date. A Railway Rates Tribunal is to be established to deal with all questions of railway charges, and the bulk of the Bill deals with this side of railway administration.The proposals of the Bill with regard to the wages and conditions of service of railway employees are contained in Clauses 56-60, which form Part IV of the Bill. They provide that the Central and the National Wages Boards shall be continued at least until the 1st January, 1923, and that to them shall be referred all questions relating to rates of pay and conditions of service in default of agreement between the railway companies and the. trade unions concerned ; that the two boards be reconstituted so that each shall include representatives of the Railway Clerks&apos; Association, in addition to representatives of the National Union of Railwaymen and of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen ; that arrangements shall be made for establishing for each railway company one or more councils consisting of officers of the railway company and of representatives of the men, the latter to be elected by the men ; and that the constitution and functions of such councils shall follow the lines laid down in paragraph 16 of the Report on Industrial Councils, known as the &quot; Whitley Report,&quot; and shall be determined by a joint committee consisting of six representatives of the General Managers&apos; Committee of the Railway Clearing House, and six representatives of the three railway trade unions. Clause 60 defines the grades of employees who are to be included within the scope of these arrange-ments.*The British Legion. A conference was held in London, on the 14th May, of repre-sentatives of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers, the Comrades of the Great War, the National Association of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers, and the Officers&apos; Association. The purpose of the conference was to complete the amalgamation of these different bodies representative of ex-Service men into one body to be named &quot; The British Legion.&quot; j The conference adopted the constitution of the Legion and chose the following officers : President, Earl Haig; chairman, Mr. T. F. Lister; vice-chairman, Col. Crossfield; treasurer, Major Cohen. The &quot;Provisional Unity Committee&quot; of the four constituent bodies was set up as the first Executive Council of the Legion ; and numerous resolutions were adopted with regard to the interests of ex-Service, men, Major-General Sir F. Maurice took a prominent part in the pro-ceedings, and gave an account of the position of the Unity Relief Fund. The Prince of Wales has consented to become the Patron of the Legion.
* It may be observed that a resolution expressing a similar demand was adopted at the annual session of the Scottish Trades Union Congress at Aberdeen last month, and at the Co-operative Congress at Scarborough this week.industrial and Other Organisations.Whitsuntide Conferences. The Whitsuntide week-end, as is customary, has been the occasion of many annual conferences of trade unions and other Labour bodies. The most important of these is the annual meeting of the Co-operative Congress, which began at Scarborough on the 16th. May and concludes on the 18th. An account of the proceedings of the Congress will be given in this Report next week. Details are given below under another heading of the annual conference of the Union of Post Office Workers at Edin-burgh in the week before Whitsuntide. The following paragraphs indicate some of the points of interest which have arisen in connection with the many other conferences.The annual conference of the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives is still in session, and the most interesting decision yet reported is the rejection of resolutions in favour of affiliation to the British bureau of the trade union international movement organised from Moscow by the &quot; Red International.&quot; The National Union of Corporation Workers have considered the question of amalgamation, and, in particular, have had before them proposals for amalgamation with the Municipal Employees&apos; Association. Their decision was that the best interests of corporation employees would be served by one union,,and therefore they should consider amalgamation, but that they should &quot; decline to wind up their union and leave others existing.&quot; The union have also decided to keep the investment of all their funds within the co-operative movement.The conferences of the Electrical Trades Union at Blackpool, and of the National Union of Clerks at Scarborough, have been held mainly in camera. The Electrical Trades Union will make decisions with .regard to the revision of rules, and, as reported, have instructed the executive to open negotiations with employers in those trades in which their members are on strike. The National Union of Clerks have been confronted with the serious financial position of the union, the burden of heavy claims for unemployment benefit having proved almost too much for a union whose finances from the beginning have been straitened. It is stated that lapses from membership during the year have amounted to 36,000. In spite, however, of the statement that only  1,000 stood between the union and liquidation, proposals both for a general levy on members and in favour of increased contributions were rejected. It was decided to hold the 1922 annual con-ference in London.The annual delegate conference of the Journeymen Butchers&apos; Federation of Great Britain has been held at Exeter. A resolution in favour of the removal of the embargo upon the importation of Canadian store cattle* was unanimously adopted, &quot; because it will give our skilled men a greater opportunity of developing their skill, and will give employ-ment to those who are unemployed to-day all over the country.&quot; The conference generally seemed in favour of amalgamation with the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assist-ants, Warehousemen and Clerks, but strong feeling was displayed against the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers.The National Association of Local Government Officers, at their conference at Edin-burgh, have discussed the position with regard to the National Joint Council for Local Authorities&apos; Administrative, Technical and Clerical Services (England and Wales). A resolution was passed regretting the withdrawal, or the threatened withdrawal, from the Council of the Association of Municipal Corporations, and of the County Councils&apos; Associa-tion. A proposal in favour of affiliation to the Trades Union Congress was rejected by an overwhelming majority.The National Union of Women Teachers, the National Association of Schoolmasters, the Association of Teachers in Technical Institutions, and the Commercial Travellers&apos; Association have also held their annual conferences during the past few days.Union of Post Office Workers. The second annual conference of the union was held at Edinburgh from the 10th to the 14th May, and was attended by 750 delegates. Mr. A. C. Winyard presided, and at the first session delivered a presidential address, after which the meeting discussed the general secretary&apos;s report. Some objections were voiced to the. action of the executive in allowing the secretary of the union to become a member of the Council of Action, but a motion for the reference back of the paragraph recording the executive^ decision on this question was defeated. The position of postal workers in Ireland was also discussed at this session, and a motion in support of the claim of Irish
* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 15, 9th April, p. 330.f It will be remembered that the strike policy was adopted by a majority in a ballot vote in November, 1920, and was formally put into operation on the 1st January, 1921.% See this Report, Vol. II, No. 17,23rd October, p. 483 ; Vol. II, No. 24,11th December, p. 656*; Vol. Ill, No. 12, 19th March, p. 272.members for an Irish National Council* subordinate to the Executive Council was opposed by the executive and rejected by the conference.On the second day, after a long debate, the motion to introduce a strike policy was re-affirmed, and a resolution declaring &quot; that this conference endorses the recent action taken by the executive in regard to the strike policy &quot; was carried on a card vote by 1,123 to 334 votes, an amendment to suspend the operations of the policy until a second ballot could be taken being heavily defeated.&quot;!&quot; It was reported that a number of with-drawTals had taken place over the enforcement of the strike policy, and several of the branches protested against it for this reason. Mr. Bowen, the general secretary, stated, however, that the executive were prepared to continue its operation in spite of such seces-sions, on the ground that diminished numbers would not weaken the union as much as giving up the right to strike. The question was further discussed on the following day, when a proposal of the executive committee that no strike should take place unless autho-rised by a two-thirds majority of those members voting in a ballot on the question, was defeated in favour of an amendment from the London Central Branch that a strike should only take place by the authority of two-thirds of the whole membership of the union, the vote to be by ballot.At the final session a resolution moved by the Bradford Branch, and carried unani-mously, pledged the union to support the miners in their demands for a national wages board and profits pool, and to collect funds through the medium of the branches, to enable them to maintain their fight.A further resolution put forward by the executive to add to the objects of the union &quot; the organisation of Post Office workers into one comprehensive industrial union with a view to the service being conducted and managed as a national guild &quot; was also carried by a large majority.National Transport Workers&apos; Federation. The scheme for the. fusion of various unions catering for transport and general workers, which has been under consideration by the members concerned for some months,! has now been agreed upon, and the new organisation, to be known as the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union, will come into existence in a few months&apos; time. A provisional conference of delegates was held in London on the 11th May to ratify the scheme as accepted by the ballot votes of the unions, and to elect provisional officers. This conference was attended by 65 delegates representing the unions who have adopted the scheme, and was presided over by Mr. Harry Gosling. It wTas unanimously decided to give effect to the proposals, and the following provisional officers were elected: President, Mr. Harry Gosling; secretary, Mr. Ernest Bevin; treasurer, Mr. H. W. Kay; trustees, Messrs. Plinton, Twomey, and A. Short, M.P. ; provisional general executive council, Messrs. A. Wilson, E. Plinton, A. C. Bennett, T. J. Wilson, G. Stevenson, T. W. Conden, G. F. Gillespie, J. W. Meggison, J. Harrison and E. W. Milford. The provisional general executive council will proceed at once to draft the rules of the new union, and it was stated at the conference that every effort would be made to bring the union into being, either by the 1st October, 1921,- or, at latest, by the 1st January. 1922.It will be remembered that the unions included in the scheme were as follows : National Union of Dock and Riverside and General Workers in Great Britain and Ireland ; Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union of Great Britain and Ireland ; Scottish Union of Dock Labourers ; Amalgamated Society of Watermen, Lightermen and Bargemen; Amalgamated Steve-dores&apos; Labour Protection League ; Labour Protection League ; National Amalgamated Labourers&apos; Union of Great Britain and Ireland; Cardiff, Penarth and Barry Coal Trimmers&apos; Union ; North of England Trimmers&apos; and Teemers&apos; Association; National&quot; Union of Docks, Wharves and Shipping Staffs; National Union of Ships&apos; Clerks, Grain Weighers and Coalmeters; United Vehicle Workers, National Union of Vehicle Workers ; North of Scotland Horse and Motormen&apos;s Association ; Associated Horsemen&apos;s Union; National Amalgamated Coal. Workers&apos; Union ; the Shipping and Transport Clerks&apos;Association of Great Britain and Ireland; United Road Transport Workers&apos; Association; and the United Order of General Workers of London.Three of these bodies, namely, the United Road Transport Workers&apos; Association, the National Union of Dock Labourers and Riverside Workers, and the United Order of General Labourers of London, have not yet completed their ballots; four, whose names have not yet been reported, have rejected the proposals, while the remainder have obtained the necessary majority in favour of amalgamation.
negotiations and disputes.Demands and Negotiations.Engineers (National). The Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations met the Amalgamated Engineering Union, the Federation of Engineering and Ship-building Trades, the National Union of Foundry Workers, and the National Federation of General Workers jointly in conference at York on the 12th May, to consider the pro-posed reductions in wages. The employers suggested that the proposed reductions* should take place in three instalments, as follows : 3s. per week for time-workers, and 12&quot;! per cent, for piece-workers on the 16th June ; a further reduction of 3s. and 7j per cent, for time-workers and piece-workers respectively in &quot; the first full pay following four weeks from that date &quot; ; and the abolition of the 12f per cent, and 7J per cent, on the first full pay-day in September. The unions, however, refused to accept the amended proposal. It is understood that the employers refused to accept the suggestion that the matter should be referred to arbitration. A deputation from the unions concerned will attend at the Ministry on the 20th May to discuss the possibility of the matter being dealt with under the Industrial Courts Act.Cotton Textile Workers (Lancashire).] On the 13th May the executive of the Lancashire Operative Cotton Spinners&apos; Association met the Emergency Committee of the Federation of Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations, Ltd., and the Spinners&apos; and Manufacturers&apos; Association, in Manchester, when the employers explained the reason for the demand for a 95 per cent, reduction on the standard list of wages. The employers stated that it was impossible for the trade to continue on the present high rate of wages. The representatives of the operatives, after hearing the statement, retired, and later informed the employers that they could not accept the reduction. Negotiations have been broken off for the time being, and no arrangements for further meetings between the two sides have yet been made.The employers&apos; representatives met the card room and blowing room operatives&apos; representatives in Manchester on the 13th May. At the close of the proceedings, it was announced that the meeting had adjourned until the 24th May.A joint meeting of representatives of the employers and of the operatives in the weaving section of the trade was held on the 11th May, when the employers stated that the chief reasons for the proposed reductions in wages were bad trade ; the necessity for cutting down&apos; * See this Report, Vol. III., No. 16, 16th April, pp. 347 and 348. t See this Report, YoL III., No. 20,14th May, p. 415.The proposals provide for the establishment of five national industrial groups governed by a General Executive Council of 16 members, the groups to represent workers engaged in the following classes of work :-docks; waterways; clerical, administrative and supervisory ; road transport; and general workers. The country will be divided into 11 geographical areas, each industrial group to be represented in the area, and each area to have an Area Council. The different groups will retain their own national group committees, . but power to decide strike action will rest with the General Executive Council, who will also control the financial and general policy of the union, the industrial groups being concerned principally with the promotion of wages applications and better conditions of work. The geographical areas, each of which will have a district office, will be London and Home Counties, South of England, West of England, South Wales, Midlands, North-West Coast, Scotland, North-East Coast, North Midlands and Yorkshire, East Coast, and Ireland. It is proposed to.elect 11 of the 16 members of the General Executive Council on the basis of one member for each area, and the remaining five on the basis of one from each industrial group. By this means, full area representation will be obtained, while the technical experience and the representation of the interests of each class of work will also be provided for.The organisation thus constituted will resemble in many respects the National Union of Railwaymen. There is a similar consolidation of executive power in the hands of the central body, but it will be seen that the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union gives relatively wider powers to the district organisations than are assigned to district councils within the National Union of Railwaymen. The groups according to industry will also tend to preserve the distinctions which exist at present, as they may, through their national group committees, conduct negotiations on their own behalf without invariably referring to the General Executive Council of the whole union.

A further joint meeting is to be held on the 18th May.Transport Workers (Lancashire). At a conference between the East Lancashire Federation of Road Transport Workers and the United Vehicle Workers, held on the 6th May,* the employers finally proposed a reduction of 4s. per week, commencing on the 1st June, and a further reduction of 3s. per week, commencing on the 1st July. The representatives of the United Vehicle Workers promised to submit this proposal to their members and to communicate the result to the employers.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Coal Miners (National).-Th.e prospects of a settlement of this dispute appear some-what brighter. In the course of a debate in the House of Commons on the 13th May, the Prime Minister stated that the moment the Government were convinced that there was a fair chance, by summoning the parties together, of arriving at a settlement, they would certainly do so.In this connection, it is of interest to note that Mr. J. McGurk, a Lancashire miners&apos; agent, and a member of the executive of the Miners&apos; Federation, stated in Manchester on the 16th that if the miners dropped the question of a national pool, he believed that an immediate settlement would be likely, while Mr. Thomas Ashton, ex-secretary of the Miners&apos; Federation, in the course of a speech at Manchester on the 17th, advocated a temporary settlement of the wages question, leaving the problem of the pool to a later date.Settlements and Agreements.Shipbuilders (Leith). The 1,500 shipyard workers who went on strike at five shipyards, on the 3rd May, j resumed work on the 12th May at the reduced rate of wages.Tube Makers (Scotland). A sliding-scale agreement, based upon the ascertained selling price per ton of black screwed and coupled tubes up to 6 in. diameter sold at Scottish works, has been adopted by the Scottish Tube Makers&apos; Wages Association, representing the employers&apos; and the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, the Workers&apos; Union and the National Union of General Workers, representing the workmen in the Scottish tube trade. Under the agreement, as the selling price moves up or down, the workers&apos; war wage rises or falls accordingly, The present war wage, following the engineering awards, is 48s., but,&apos; under the agreement, the men accept an immediate reduction of 6s. per week, leaving 42s. as their new war wage, which will be adjusted from time to time, according to variations in the selling price. The first application of the scale is to take place on the 1st August, 1921, and thereafter is to change every quarter. It has been agreed, however, that, whatever the ascertained selling price now, wages shall not be reduced more than 4s. on the 1st August.&quot;Tube makers&apos; wages in other districts follow the engineering awards.Woodworkers (Scotland). The Scottish Employers&apos; National Federation of Packing-case Makers met the Amalgamated Society of Packing Case Makers and the Amalgamated Society of Wood Cutting Machinists in conference on the 5th May. The subject of reduc-tions of wages was discussed, and it was agreed to accept the provisions of the agreement concluded previously between the Scottish Timber Merchants&apos; and Sawmillers&apos; Association and the Amalgamated Society of Wood Cutting Machinists. JCinema Employees (Scotland). With reference to the dispute regarding wages reduc-tions wdiich has been the subject of a conference between the Scottish Cinema Owners&apos; Association and the Amalgamated Musicians&apos; Union J a meeting of the Entertainments Joint Industrial Council was held in London on the 5th May, when considerable progress was made towards a settlement. The issue has been obscured, however, by the question of hours ; and the whole question was.referred back to the local Conciliation Board for further consideration and adjustment. A meeting of this Board was held on the 10th May, when a settlement was effected, and a form of agreement is in preparation.[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Industrial Relations Departments section of the Report, pages 437 to 440.]
PART II-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DEPARTMENT.ENGINEERING, SHIPBUILDING AND ALLIED TRADES.Wire Workers (London).-A strike of members of the National Brass and Metal Mechanics&apos; Union began on the 23rd April, following a reduction in wages from Is. lOd. to Is. Sd. per hour for time-workers, and a proportionate decrease in the case of piece-workers. At a conference on the 5th May the employers proposed a cost-of-living sliding scale, and this was welcomed by the trade union side. At a further conference on the 17th May, at which the Chief Conciliation Officer, London, was present, it was agreed that the index figure for the cost of living to represent Is. 9d. per hour should be 137. It was further agreed that existing piece-work earnings should be reduced by 5 per cent. The agreement is to come into operation as from the 6th May.BUILDING AND WORKS OF CONSTRUCTION.Builders (Norwich). On the 2nd May the local branch of the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives withdrew the operatives employed by a contractor on the Norwich Corporation housing scheme, in consequence of the institution, contrary to the rules of the union, of a system of sub-contracting for labour only, owing to the alleged insufficient output hitherto obtained by the contractor. After two conferences presided over by the Chief Conciliation Officer, it was agreed that the system should be withdrawn by the contractor, in return for a guarantee by the union to co-operate in supplying labour, and to make every effort to see that a fair day&apos;s work is performed. On these terms work was to be resumed on the 9th May, and a further conference was to be held in a fortnight to consider the new position.MINING AND QUARRYING.Claij. The employers&apos; side of the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee, made an application before the Industrial Court for general reductions in wages.The advances in wages previously granted amounted, for males, 21 years and over, to 49s. per week; for males 18 years and under 21, to 39s.; for males under 18 years, to 23s. Qd.; for females, 18 years and over, to 35s.; and for females under 18 years, to 22s. %d. The last advances, granted by agreement in October, 1920, were 6s., 4s., 2s. Qd., 3s. and Is. 6d. for these classes respectively. These last advances appeared to the Court to have been granted on the ground of the increased cost of living. The reductions proposed by the employers were considerably larger than the corresponding advances given to meet the increase in the cost of living.The Court decided that the wages of the workers concerned be reduced by the amount of the last advance, from the beginning of the first pay period following the 12th May. (Award No. 643.)FOOD AND DRINK.Scottish Bakers.-At a meeting of the Joint Industrial Council in Edinburgh on the 12th May, the general secretary of the union intimated that the ballot on the acceptance of the wages offer made by the employers at the previous meeting showed 2,927 votes for acceptance, and 2,779 against.The question of a new working agreement was afterwards dealt with. Clause 2a of last year&apos;s agreement was amended to read as follows : &quot; The above rate of wages is fixed on a basis of a 44-hour week; the allocation of the working hours during the week to be arranged by the Local Joint Committee.&quot;The clause regarding working time on Saturday was deleted, as it was decided that the question was appropriate for settlement by the Local Joint Committee when con-sidering the allocation of the 44 hours. All the other clauses of last year&apos;s agreement were adopted on the understanding that the operation of the agreement would, if desired
by either side, be reviewed in October next, and that, meanwhile, the proposed scale of wages for foremen submitted by the union should receive the employers&apos; consideration. It was decided that the new agreement should become operative as from the 16th May.The Council unanimously resolved to make overtures to the Minister on the question of the granting of fuller powers to Joint Industrial Councils, and to communicate with the Association of Industrial Councils and Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committees with a view to soliciting co-operation in the matter.Sugar Refining.-the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee met on the 10th May, to discuss a proposal by the workers for an all-round increase of 10s., and a counter-proposal by the employers to reduce wages. It was finally agreed to stabilise wages at their present rate for three months. The employers stated that if, in the mean-time, the engineering employees agreed to accept a reduction in wages, they would probably call a meeting of the Committee to consider a similar reduction, but that no reduction would become operative until three months had elapsed.TEXTILES.Wool (and Allied) Textiles. The Joint Industrial Council met in Bradford on the 12th May, chiefly to discuss the basis of wages on the expiration of the current agreement on the 31st May. The employers emphasised the necessity for stabilising the costs of production for a long period, in order to restore confidence and to enable manufacturers to quote firm prices. They accordingly proposed that the addition of 15 per cent, to pre-war basic rates, agreed upon by the Council in 1919 and 1920, should be reduced to 10 per cent., and that the cost-of-living wage, payable on pre-war basic rates and the 10 per cent, addition to basic rates, should be paid on the assumption that the cost-of-- living index figure had fallen to 90. Proportionate reductions were proposed for piece-workers, and for the more highly-paid workers, such as overlookers. A twelve months&apos; agreement, to date from the 11th June, was suggested.The immediate effect of the proposals would be to reduce the present wage of 270 units to 209, or a 22-66 per cent, reduction on gross wages, for time-workers, the pro-portionate reductions varying from 19-99 per cent, to 22 per cent, for piece-workers. The percentage reduction decreases with the fall in the cost of living.The meeting was adjourned until the 30th May. The operatives&apos; representatives were not instructed by their executives to negotiate, and the union executives will meet to consider the position.  The tone of the meeting was quite friendly.SPELTER AND LEAD.rLead Manufacturing. At a meeting of the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Com-mittee on the 10th May, the trade union side agreed to recommend to their executives, and the workpeople concerned, a reduction in wages of \\d. per hour, to come into force on the pay-day in the week ending the 11th June.A draft constitution for a Joint Industrial Council was approved, and will be sub-mitted to the department.PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND PUBLIC UTILITY SERVICES.Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services Manual Workers (England and Wales).-A conference of representatives of the local authorities in the County of Hertford, and representatives of the trade unions concerned, was held on the 9th May, to consider what re-arrangement of the area of the Joint Industrial Council for, the Northern Home Counties would receive adequate support. If was decided that a Provincial Council be formed for the County of Hertford, consisting of 20 representatives of the local authorities in the county and 20 representatives of the trade unions. A committee was appointed to draft a constitution for submission to a further conference.Waterworks Undertakings. The National Council met on the 11th May. It was arranged that the Executive Committee should take into consideration the question of whether the Council should make some general recommendations with a view to bringing about a reduction in the wages of waterworks employees, and also with regard to annual holidays.  The committee are to report on the 1st July.Gas Undertakings (West Scotland).-Members of the Operative Bricklayers&apos; Society employed by the gas undertakings at Paisley, Port Glasgow, Greenock, Gourock,
Dumbarton, Helensburgh and Cambuslang ceased work on the 7th May, on a demand for payment of the special rates of wages agreed between the Scottish Steelmakers&apos; Wages Board and the Glasgow District Operative Bricklayers&apos; Society.The employers met in Glasgow on the 9th May, and the Federation of Gas Employers met in London on the 10th May. It is understood that the latter meeting was attended by the secretary of the Scottish employers, and that the meeting suggested that the Scottish employers should meet again at an early date and consider the question of referring the dispute to arbitration. The Chief Conciliation Officer is in touch with the parties.Corporation Tramway Workers (Glasgow). Arising out of the decision of the Triple Alliance to instruct their members to cease work on the 15th April, four members of the United Vehicle Workers in the service of the Glasgow Corporation, who failed to satisfy the manager that they would continue to work after 10.30 p.m. on that day, were dismissed. A ballot of the local members of the union has been,taken, as to whether reinstatement should be enforced by a strike, but the result has not yet been made public. Negotiations are proceeding between the manager and the local official of the union. It is understood to be the intention of the latter to approach the department.MISCELLANEOUS TRADES.Making and Packing of Textiles for Export. A meeting of the London District Committee of the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee was held on the 9th May, to receive the reply of the workers to the employers&apos; proposals for a sliding-scale wages agreement, to be brought into operation at an early date. The workers agreed in principle to the proposal, but stated that they were unable to discuss details until they had prepared a schedule of basic rates for all grades of workers, both in the export packing and the cloth workers&apos; sections.  The meeting was therefore again adjourned for three weeks.Blind Basket Makers (Paisley).-A number of blind basket makers employed on piece-work at the Paisley and District Workshop for the Blind had been paid 10 per cent, below the standard union rate obtaining in the district. In February last application was made for a minimum wage of  2 15s. per week, which was refused. A further appli-cation in March was also refused, and on the 26th March the men decided to cease work. Several abortive attempts have been made by the union to arrive at a settlement, the Board of Management contending that they had not the money to meet the claim. The Chief Conciliation officer afterwards got into touch with both sides and convened a joint conference, as a result of which work was resumed on the 10th May and a joint reference to the Industrial Court was obtained.Shop Assistants (Manchester). A conference between the Manchester, Salford ond District Grocers&apos; Association and the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks was arranged by the Chief Conciliation Officer on the 9th May. The employers, in view of the anticipated meeting of the Grocery and Provisions Trade Board on the 18th May, agreed to allow the union 14 days to consider their offer of a sliding scale.Needle, Fish-Hook, Fishing Tackle and Allied Trades-The Wages Committee of the Industrial Council met on the 10th May, when the employers&apos; association and the unions agreed upon the reductions. The reduced rates will be put into operation on the pay-day of the week ending the 14th May, and will be coincident with the re-establishment of youths&apos; and boys&apos; rates in accordance with the agreement of May, 1920. An amendment to the Councils recommendation relative to piece-work prices was put forward by the employers&apos; association, which amounted to the deletion of the clause relating to consultation with the union concerned before the reduction of any existing piece-work price. The union raised strong opposition to the suggested amendment and were supported in their attitude by Mr. Millward. The secretary was instructed to place the matter again before the employers&apos; association, and to point out that the recommendation had the entire support of the Council.PROFESSIONAL WORKERS.Wireless Operators. Representatives of the Association of Wireless Telegraphists called at Montagu House on the 6th May with reference to wages reductions proposed by the London&apos; and District Association of Engineering Employers, acting on behalf of the Marconi International Marine Communication Co., Ltd., and Messrs. Siemens Bros.

The principal changes reported during the week are noted below.Industrial Relations Department-continued.&amp; Co., Ltd. The parties have agreed to refer the matter to the Industrial Court for arbitration.GENERAL.Legal Enforceability of an Award under the Industrial Court Act. The opinion of the Solicitor on the decision of Sheriff Robertson* that a certain firm was liable to pay the increase of piece-work prices awarded by the Industrial Court, is as follows : &quot; The legal position may be summarised as follows: In my opinion there is no power to enforce at law an award made by an Industrial Court under the Industrial Cour.ts Act, 1919; a contract, however, made between two parties is legally binding upon them, and if the contract is that A should employ B and should pay him for his services a rate of wages determined or to be determined by the award of an Industrial Copt, if A does not pay those wages, B can sue him for breach of contract.&quot; Whether such a contract was made is a question of fact to be proved by evidence. If it is asserted that the contract is one made by a trade union as agent for the worker and another trade union as agent for the employer, the onus is upon the person seeking to establish rights under the contract to prove the agency, and to prove as a fact that the contract was made between the principals, i.e., the employer and worker, through their agents duly authorised in that behalf. If it is proved only that there was an agreement between two trade unions, such an agreement is not, in my opinion, enforceable at law by reason of Section 4, of the Trade Union Act, 1871; but an agreement made between two trade unions may, if those trade unions are authorised to contract as agents for an employer and workman as principals (which is a pure question of fact), constitute a contract, not between the agents, the trade unions, but between the principals. In the present case the newspaper report does not detail the evidence, and I am not in a position to judge whether there was. evidence upon which the Sheriff could find the facts he did. His judgment is not, I think, of great importance, for it deals with no principle of law, and his decision is determined by a question of fact.&quot;[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Industrial Relations will he found also on pages 430 to 436 and 444.]
Employment and Insurance Department-continued. Men&apos;s Employment.Iron and Steel. At Motherwell, Messrs. D. Colville &amp; Sons, Ltd., normally employing 4,000 workpeople, and Messrs. Stewarts &amp; Lloyds, Ltd., employing 1,100, have now closed down. At Wishaw, it is anticipated that all steel works in the area will close during the week. Sir W. G. Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co., Ltd., Elswick, have put their loco-motive department on short time, although the orders in hand warrant full-time working. At Middlesbrough, 850 fresh claims were taken during the week, chiefly from men hitherto on maintenance and repair work. In the North Shields area, engineering is almost at a standstill, and at Whitehaven two engineering works have closed.The large Sheffield firms are continuing to put off men in increasing numbers. Messrs. E. Allen &amp; Co., Ltd., have now stopped 1,500 men. Messrs. had fields, Ltd., have dis-charged 400 during the week, and contemplate discharging 800 more next week. Messrs. T. Firth &amp; Sons, Ltd., are closing down entirely. At Scunthorpe all iron and steel works are closed, but the firms are employing some 350 men on moving slag for road-making. At Sutton-in-Ashfield, the Butterley Co., Ltd., and the Alfreton Ironworks, employing 1,000 men, are closing down.&apos; Messrs. Vickers, Ltd., Barrow, contemplate closing their whole works at Whitsuntide until the coal dispute is settled, which will involve some 13,000 men. At Warrington, Messrs. Pearson &amp; Knowles, Ltd., and Messrs. Monks, Hall &amp; Co., Ltd., have almost entirely suspended operations, and the Partington Steel and Iron Co., Ltd., have closed down. Practically all employers in the Smethwick area have agreed to close for a long holiday at Whitsuntide. Messrs. Ransomes, Sims &amp; Jefferies, Ltd., Ipswich, are now entirely closed, and at Kettering the New Cransley Iron and Steel Co., Ltd., have closed down their last furnace.The position in Wales is practically unchanged, though at Crumlin the tinplate works of Messrs. Richard Thomas &amp; Co. have re-opened for a fortnight, and some 150 to 200 workpeople have been re-engaged by the Dafen Tinplate Co., Ltd., Llanelly.Shipbuilding and Allied Industries. On the Clyde all the yards are being affected by the coal stoppage. At Govan, Messrs. A. Stephen &amp; Sons, Ltd., and the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Co., Ltd., have gone on short time for want of electrical power. Messrs. Harland &amp; Wolff, Ltd., are still working full time, but their position is daily becoming more critical. At Port Glasgow workmen are steadily being discharged on completion of contracts.On the Tyne, Tees and Wear, discharges have taken place from a firm at Hebburn; 300 men have been put on short time by Messrs. Palmer&apos;s Shipbuilding and Iron Co., Ltd., Jarrow ; and 600 men are affected by the closing of the shipyard of Messrs. Craig, Taylor &amp; Co., Ltd., at Thornaby. At Tyne Dock two large dock companies are without a job of any kind, and the staffs are taking annual leave. The Middleton and Harbour Shipyards of Messrs. Irvine&apos;s Shipbuilding and Dry Docks Co., Ltd., West Hartlepool, have closed down, throwing about 1,000 men out of employment. At Willington Quay, owing to restrictions on electric power, practically all firms are working only 24 hours per week. At South Bank, however, the Smith&apos;s Dock Co., Ltd., are continuing to employ some 1,200 men so long as the electricity supply is maintained. On the Mersey work is at a very low ebb. It is estimated that owing to prohibitive costs, and the joiners&apos; dispute, over 100 ships are now being refitted abroad instead of on the Mersey.In South Wales a little work on short jobs has been available in the dry docks at Swansea for boilermakers, fitters and helpers, but work in the other yards is almost at a standstill.Textiles and Clothing.-FuTth.ei drastic restrictions due to shortage of fuel are reported from cotton centres; some small effort is being made to adapt mill boilers for oil fuel. In the woollen textile trade Sir Titus Salt &amp; Sons, Ltd., Shipley, have closed down except for their finishing department, 2,300 workers being affected. Two Wakefield firms, however, report a slight trade revival, and will commence full time working after a settle-ment of the coal dispute.In the lace trade, coal supplies in the Beeston district are becoming exhausted, and two factories have closed down indefinitely. At Long Eaton there is sufficient coal in hand to meet the work available. The favourable position in the boot and shoe trade at Northampton is maintained despite the coal shortage, and at Stafford factories are still working full time. In the hosiery trade the shortage of power is having a serious effect, and many factories are closing down entirely.
Miscellaneous Trades. At Warrington, Messrs. J. Crosfield &amp; Sons, Ltd., soap manu-facturers, employing 3,000 workers/contemplated closing down on the 15th May ; several departments of the Co-operative Wholesale Society&apos;s works at Irlam are also closed, although orders are plentiful. *In the chemical trade, Messrs. Brunner, Mond &amp; Co., Ltd., Northwich, are re-arranging their short-time working on an alternate-week system. At Fleetwood the works of the United Alkali Co., Ltd., have closed down, approximately 1,100 workpeople being affected.The embargo on the supply of coal to breweries has not yet resulted in dismissals at Burton-on-Trent, and stocks are thought sufficient for at least three weeks.A large number of fishermen, fish lumpers and fish-house workers have been dismissed at Grimsby, and the industry is gradually being brought to a standstill. At Fleetwood 135 trawlers out of 150 are tied up ; but at Milford Haven large supplies of fish have been landed during the week.In the Metropolitan area no large discharges have been reported during the week, and at West Ham the rubber works of Messrs. W. Warne &amp; Co., Ltd., employing 151 workpeople, have re-started work.Women&apos;s Employment.Local Reports. In the North-Western Division the improved prospect in the cotton trade is maintained, but cannot take effect owing to shortage of fuel. An increasing number of mills are slowing down, or closing altogether, pending the settlement of the dispute. The textile industry is seriously affected in the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division, and several firms previously on short time are now compelled to close down indefinitely owing to shortage of fuel. Other industries in these divisions are affected in a less degree.The South Midlands and Eastern Division report some indication of improvement in the boot trade, which is retarded by the lack of fuel. Three firms in Northampton are on full time. Leicester also report that an improvement in this trade is only retarded, by the coal shortage. At Bedford and Kettering short time is  till being worked. The printing trade remains very slack, and short time is common throughout the clothing trades.  Chocolate workers have resumed full time at Watford.Unemployment in the London and South-Eastern Division does not appear to have been materially affected by the coal shortage. Factory workers, none the less, are swelling the live registers at almost every Exchange, and many clerical workers are unemployed. There is slackness in the dressmaking and tailoring trades, which is not common at this season..Serious reports continue to be received from the West Midlands Division. The pottery trade is practically at a standstill owing to coal shortage, and the metal and allied trades continue very slack. In Burslem over 7,000 women and girls, mainly pottery workers, are claiming unemployment insurance benefit, and at Hanley there are approxi-mately 5,000 pottery workers registered.There is little change in the general situation in the South-Western and Wales Divisions. In the Northern Division all work is retarded by the coal strike, and in Scotland unemployment is serious in the bigger towns and in the staple industries.All divisions report that seasonal domestic service work is seriously affected by the continued coal stoppage and the restricted railway service.DISCHARGED AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.National Scheme.-]]]) to and including the 9th May, 25,290 certificates have.been issued to employers under the scheme. The undertakings given by these employers cover 280,081 disabled ex-Service men.The decision of the Government with regard to the restriction of Government con-tracts, save in very exceptional circumstances, to firms on the King&apos;s Roll, has been communicated to all employers&apos; associations, with a request that they inform their members.JUVENILE BRANCH.Arrangements for Unemployed Juveniles. The only addition to the number of approved unemployment centres has been in Dublin, where a centre has been opened in co-operation with the local Technical Education Committee. The Juvenile Advisory Committees in Belfast, Cork, Limerick and Waterford are also considering the question.
appointments and training.APPOINTMENTS AND CIVIL LIABILITIES DEPARTMENT.APPOINTMENTS.Statistics. During the week ending the 6th May, the department placed 263 candidates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 54,497. Of these 7,148 have been placed through the agency of Ithe departments Interviewing Boards. Applications were registered from. 596 ex-Service men and 17 civilians. The number of candidates available for appointments on the 6th May was 11,299 ex-Service men and 1,261 civilians. At the same date 818 &quot; live &quot; vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 265 having been registered during the week.BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.Business Training Scheme. During the week ending the 6th May, the department received 45 applications for training under this scheme, bringing the total number of applications to 3,279, of which 1,778 have since been cancelled. Grants have been sanctioned in 732 cases. At the same date, 313 vacancies were at&apos; the disposal of the department, 17 having been registered during the week.Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The department have dealt with a total of 1,199 cases, in 524 of which the training sanctioned is provided by the Appointments Department, and in the remainder by other Government departments. Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed training in 333 cases, and abandoned training in 45 ; 116 are still in training and 30 are awaiting training.TRAINING DEPARTMENT. INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men.Statistics.-On the 10th May, 24,321 men were in training, as against 24,376 on the 3rd May, and 24,385 on the 12th. April. During the week, 387 men were placed in training. There were 16,455 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 3rd May and theCommittees, however, are continuing to make informal arrangements for the recreation and instruction of unemployed juveniles. In connection with the classes at Greenock a sports club has been organised, and games competitions on the league principle have been started? A committee of unemployed men has been formed to organise and supervise the arrangements. Another development in Greenock is the institution of technical classes for apprentice engineers, who are working alternate weeks. Notice of the classes has been sent to all apprentice engineers drawing unemployment benefit, and a large number have expressed their willingness to attend.At Ayr the local education committee are co-operating with the Juvenile Advisory Committee in arranging training classes for girls in domestic service. The classes will be open to unemployed girls between the ages of 14 and 18.Domestic Servants&apos; Club. The Great Marlborough Street Juvenile Advisory Com-mittee are hoping to arrange for the after-care of young domestic servants placed by the committee, by co-operating with a club recently established in the West End exclusively for the benefit of domestic servants. The club is managed by a committee of servants and mistresses, and aims at being educational as well as social[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment and Insurance Department will also be found on page 430.]
Appointments and Training-continued.12th April being 16,491 and 16,867. The number of men whose training had been com-pleted since the 1st August, 1919 was 31,491, the totals for the 3rd May and the 12th April being 31,049 and 29,708.Three divisions, the Irish, the London, and the South-Eastern, with 4,073, 3,595 and 1,593 names, respectively, account for upwards of half the total of the waiting list, but, in all three, conditions are abnormal. The South-Eastern Division were the last to secure factory facilities on any considerable scale, and by the time the factories were ready the &apos; trade depression had set in. In most of the other divisions, the waiting lists have been reduced to comparatively manageable proportions; in seven the total is below 500, the figures in this group ranging from 140 in Wales to 458 in Devon and Cornwall.Government Instructional Factories. There has been an increase during the past week of 141 in the number of men on the rolls of the Factories, and the total has now reached 10,918. LoughborOugh, with very nearly 600, are now first as regards numbers of men in training, while Sarisbury Court come second with 535. Aberdeen for the first time this year have once more passed the 400 mark.National Trade Advisory Committees: Pottery. The proposed meeting of the National Trade Advisory Committee at Stoke on the 5th May was cancelled on the ground that it would be useless, owing to the present industrial conditions. The meeting will be held when conditions have materially improved. The first meeting of the National Trade Advisory Committee for the Stoneware Section of the industry was also postponed.Local Technical Advisory Committees: Boat Building. The panel for Rochester, to cover the whole of the area surrounding the River Medway, is now complete, and will meet shortly to pass men into training at Sarisbury Court.Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics. Up to the 11th May, agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 46,298 apprentices, under the 41 schemes approved. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 44,175 apprentices, employed by 17,579 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 24,419.Applications. An application has recently been made by Messrs. Cammell, Laird &amp; Co., Ltd., Nottingham, railway carriage and wagon builders, for seven apprentices to be brought under the scheme. The firm purchased the National Ordnance Factory, Notting-ham, and while doing everything possible to keep employed the apprentices who were engaged by the Ministry of Munitions, they were obliged to reduce the number of employees to 300. The transition stage has now been passed, and there are 1,200 hands employed in these works. The seven men, all pre-war apprentices, have been reinstated, and the firm have submitted the cases for special consideration.General Training.Apprenticeship : Building.-At Croydon, a fully representative meeting discussed the national scheme, and resolved to set up an Apprenticeship Committee. It was decided to enlist the co-operation of the educational authorities forthwith, and the unanimity of feeling which was apparent promises an early and successful operation, of the scheme. Representatives of all branches of the industry, and of the county and borough education authorities, met at Loughborough on the 28th April. Representatives were also present from the neighbouring towns. It was decided that it was desirable to adopt the scheme. Particular attention was given to the provision of technical instruction. The success of this conference is all the more encouraging in view of the fact that Lough-borough refused, in the first instance, to have anything to do with the scheme and would not brook interference. A similar decision in favour of the scheme was arrived at on the preceding day, when employers and operatives met at Dudley. Assurances were given that any proposals for technical education would receive the sympathetic consideration of the local education committee. It was stated that already a very high percentage of apprentices in local works were attending the Dudley Technical School.[Reference to matters of interest to the Appointments and Training Departments will also be found on pages 442 and 443.]
