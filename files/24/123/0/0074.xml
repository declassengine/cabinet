GENERAL.The gradual exhaustion of coal supplies is resulting in a rapid increase of unemployment in all parts of the country. The large coal-consuming industries are naturally the most affected, and in the North of England and Scotland many of the large iron and steel firms are now entirely closed, while continuous discharges are taking place from engineering establishments. The fuel shortage has also resulted in drastic restrictions in the cotton industry, although an attempt has been made in some cases to make use of oil fuel. The Cotton Control Board have now ceased to make grants to unemployed operatives. The favourable position of the boot and shoe trade at Northampton and Stafford is maintained, and an improvement in the hosiery trade is expected as soon as coal supplies become normal.II. EMERGENCY WORK.As announced by the Prime Minister on the 19th October, certain schemes have been put in hand by the Local Authorities in conjunction with the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Health, and by the Local Authorities themselves, designed to secure work for unemployed men, preferentially ex-Service men. The following is the result at this date: (a.) New Arterial Roads.20,887 men employed up to date (in and around London, 2,568: Provinces, 18,319).(b.) Road Maintenance.It is estimated that employment has been provided for approximately 20,000 men over and above those ordinarily so employed.(c.) Housing (Acceleration of the Lay-Out of Roads and Sewers and Approved Housing Schemes).Men employed up to the 13th May, 3,836 (in and around London, 459; Provinces. 3,377).(d.) Lord St. Davids&apos; Committee.Men employed on work other than the above up to the 13th May, 31,840 (in and around London, 5,879; Provinces, 25,961).(e.) Alternative Work in Government Establishments.War Office establishments: men employed up to the 13th May, 2,839 (in and around London, 2,036; Provinces, 803).Alternative work provided in Admiralty establishments: men employed up to the 14th May, 5,757 (in and around London, nil; Provinces, 5,757).(f.) Short-time in Government Establishments.Number of men who have found employment up to the 14th May as a result of the introduction of short-time system: War Office establishments, 2,229 (in and around London, 2,035; Provinces, 194) ; Admiralty establishments, 4,129 (in and around London, 204; Provinces, 3,925),(g.) Office of Works Emergency Programme.Total number of men employed on the 13th May as a result of the bringing forward of decorating and repair work in Government Departments by the Office of Works is 260 (in and around London, 73; Provinces, 187)(h.) Emergency Work found by Local Authorities.Total number of men employed up to the 13th May, 12,726 (in and around london, 2,914; Provinces, 9,812).Total labour employed on above schemes = 104,503.
As reports for the week ended the 13th May have been received from only 362 Local Authorities out of 404 who were asked to furnish information, it is probable that the Relief Schemes which have been inaugurated by the Government and Local Authorities are finding employment for a number of men in excess of the figures given.III. 50,000 EX-SERYICE MEN TO BE TRAINED IN THE BUILDINGINDUSTRY.The Employers&apos; Associations are taking steps to set up throughout the country the District Committees which are to be established to select applicants and allocate them to the trades in which they can be trained most suitably. The number of applications received to date totals 14,867. In the London and South-Eastern Division 6,671 men have applied, and the following are figures for other divisions: South Midlands and Eastern Counties, 965; South-Western Counties, L182; West Midlands, 1,405; Yorkshire and East Midlands, 1,365; North-Western Counties. 2,001; Northern Division, 347; Scotland, 777; Wales, 154.Only a few applicants have so far been actually accepted under the scheme.IY.
