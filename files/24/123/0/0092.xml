Two telegrams from&apos; His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Rome embodying two proposals made by the Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs for the partition of Upper Silesia.2. A memorandum by Major Ottley commenting on these proposals. 3. A map illustrating the frontier between Germany and Poland which would result from the acceptance of these proposals.C. of K.May 27, 1921.-   (1.)Sir G. Buchanan to Earl Curzon. (Received May 24.)(No. 183.)(Telegraphic.) Rome, May 23, 1921.MY telegram No. 179.Minister for Foreign Affairs sent for me this evening and handed me promised memorandum, of which translation is given in my telegram immediately following.In reply to several questions of mine his Excellency said that his present proposals took more account of nationality than those of General de Marinis. He laid stress on fact that while two principles laid down in second paragraph were intended as definite proposals, two formulas in his fourth paragraph were not so intended, but were susceptible of amendment in course of discussion in Ambassadors&apos; Conference where the one selected would be given its final shape.He was personally in favour of second formula as it would give Germany larger proportion of industrial district; but we must remember there were graver issues at stake than question as to which of the two countries was to have lion&apos;s share of that district. Feeling in France was running dangerously high; Anglo-French relations were being put to severe strain; and Poles and Germans were fighting one another. He had, therefore, endeavoured to find some compensation that would be acceptable to Poland and that would, he hoped, prove sop to appease French, by extending Polish frontier in districts where there was mixed population so as to give Poland control of most important railway.In exacting from France engagement not to assist Poles, should they take military action beyond frontier, and in authorising French to extend their temporary occupation on right bank of Rhine, should German regular troops cross the frontier, his idea was to apply impartially to both parties sanctions, threat of which would, he hoped, have the same satisfactory result as threatened occupation of Ruhr had had in the matter of German reparations.His Excellency begged me to explain that memorandum was his official reply to enquiries which you had addressed to him through me, but that he was not com-munieating it officially to French Government. He would, however, telegraph it to Italian Ambassador at Paris for his information and your Lordship was at liberty to discuss it with. French if vou desired to do so.Sir G. Buchanan to Earl Curzon. (Received May 24.)(No. 184.)(Telegraphic.)   D. Rome, May 23, 1921.FOLLOWING is translation of memorandum handed to me to-day by Ministry for Foreign Affairs :-&quot; The increasing seriousness of situation in Upper Silesia renders it desirable to find a rapid solution of the question on which difference of opinion between France344   [6316]\ Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1921.
and England is concentrated and exasperated. Given that an immediate meeting of Supreme Council appears not to be easily possible and might moreover accentuate rather than diminish&apos;the tension between London and Paris, I would consider it opportune to settle question of Upper Silesia by means of an agreement between the three Allied Governments on the following basis which could be defined by Conference of Ambassadors,  I presume that Allied Governments recognise: &quot;1. That the problem of Upper Silesia should be regulated in accordance with Treaty of Versailles and results of plebiscite.&quot;2. That neither Poland nor Germany can independently decide on the merits of the case. Generally speaking agreement should be made on principles announced by Mr. Lloyd George which even the French Government could not disavow; hut their application would have the equitable result of giving satisfaction to the just demands of Poland according to result of plebiscite.&quot; In view of the fact that plebiscite has given to Germany less than 60 per cent, of individual votes and less than 55 per cent, of communal votes, it must be recognised as just that frontier should be so drawn as to give Germany and Poland respectively territories, as far as possible, proportionate to percentage yielded by plebiscite whether considered from point of view of their area or population.&quot; I therefore submit two formulas not as definite proposals but as basis of discussion.&quot; 1. Poland should have Southern part of commune Ratibor on right bank of Oder; part of commune Rybnik deducting north-west salient traversed by Ratibor-Gleiwitz railway which would remain with Germany; communes Kattowitz, Konigshutte, Beuthen and Tarnowitz; the extreme fringe south-east of commune Rural-Gleiwitz and southern point of district of Zabrze; the eastern part of district of Lublinitz including Stahlhammer. This solution would divide industrial district leaving Gleiwitz and Zabrze to Germany.&quot;2. Poland would not receive as under above arrangement Konigshutte and that portion of communes of Beuthen and Kattowitz situated between Konigshutte and Zabrze. She would receive in compensation the eastern part of commune Lublinitz and of Rosenberg with their two principal towns so as to have in her hands the whole railway line connecting Beuthen with Posen. This solution would leave a much greater part of industrial region to Germany and would accord an important railway to Poland.&quot; Both interchange of views between the three Allied Governments and eventual discussions of Ambassadors&apos; Conference should be kept strictly secret in order to prevent the danger of repercussions in Upper Silesia. When, and if final decision shall have been reached it should be communicated to Governments of Berlin and Warsaw who should proceed with least possible delay to occupy zone assigned to them with their regular troops. France should guarantee not to support Poland in the event of Polish troops crossing the frontier line agreed on, or supporting Polish insurgents beyond it. On the other hand, France would be authorised to extend provisionally the areas which she has temporarily occupied on right bank of Rhine as sanctions, in the event of Germany&apos;s regular troops crossing the frontier or supporting German rebels beyond it,&quot;(2.)Proposals of the Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs.1. THESE proposals are based on the assumption that the original report of the Italian Commissioner, in which his British colleague concurred, paid insufficient attention to the question of nationality. It is, however, a fundamental axiom Tn the problem of- Upper Silesia, which is denied by nobody, that the central industrial area is one and indivisible economically. A large proportion of the report, signed conjointly by Colonel Percival and General de Marinis, is devoted to a detailed elaboration of this axiom, which in the present Italian proposals has been utterly ignored.2. In effect, the new proposal divides the area into &quot;two unequal parts, the lesser to be given to Germany and the greater to Poland.
3. Far from giving greater weight to the principle of nationality, the Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs admits to being swayed by the heat of public feeling in England and France (vide Sir George Buchanan&apos;s telegram No. 183 of the 24th May, paragraph 3, attached).4. The results of the two Italian solutions, which are put forward as alterna-tives, would be, from a plebiscite point of view, respectively as follows : Scheme I.Polish Zone: 304,833 Polish votes and 255,242 German; i.e., in every 100 inhabitants there would be 54-4 Poles and 45-6 Germans.German Zone: 452,363 German votes and 174,526 Polish votes; i.e., in every 100 inhabitants there would be 72 Germans and 28 Poles.Scheme II.Polish Zone: 262,434 Polish votes and 208,326 German; i.e., in every 100 inhabitants there would be 55-7 Poles and 44-3 Germans.German Zone: 499,279 German votes and 206,925 Poles; i.e., in every 100 inhabitants there would be 70-7 Germans and 29-3 Poles.In this connection it may be recalled that the Anglo-Italian line gives propor-tions of 65 and 35 in the German zone and 63 and 37 in the Polish zone respectively.5. Thus, even ignoring the question of the practical impossibility of drawing a frontier through the industrial area, Count Sforza does not achieve a result so satisfactory as the one as the one he condemns.6. Economically the position would be that Germany would obtain, under Scheme I, coalmines which produced in 1913 8-76 million tons; and, under Scheme II, mines which produced 18-05 million tons, out of a total product of some 43 million tons. Poland would, however, receive some 90 per cent, of the coal reserves and the whole of the zinc, lead, silver and iron.7. Thus neither economically nor from the point of view of plebiscite result .does Count Sforza&apos;s scheme constitute an improvement. It is clearly drawn up in Eome by those who have never visited the country, and who must be little experienced in industrial countries, for Solomon&apos;s judgment is applicable here. Only those who have no &quot;real interests in the country could seriously consider a division of this nature.L. E. OTTLEY.Foreign Of/ice, May 25, 1921.
