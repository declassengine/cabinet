(TFI3 DOCUMENT IS TUT PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAKKIC VASTC^^^ OOVERK^iJT), SECRET.&apos;                             C A E I 1-1 T T, CP .2914,. ...........THE glggggj STOPPAGE,Memorandum by Dr. AcUUson,Tho present position of tho Cool Dispute is as lamentableas can well be imaginodt.    It appears to be that of thoparties, narking tine whilst tho Nation bleeds,I have never boon ablo to understand on what groundswc   have taken up the attitude that a Pool necessarily means the continuation of State Control and subsidy.     It apocarsto bo a lo^ic that is somewhat lacking In ingenuity.The justification of tho offer of a further  10,000,000to help this industry, as distinguished from others, Is, I suppose, that de-control is our action and that during control for a considerable period the State benefited   from thehigh prices obtained.It is difficult to make suggestions in the absence of help from those who have the figures at their command, butif tho figures quoted in Mr, HodgoTs letter to the Timesyesterday may be taken as correct it would appear -(1)   That a reduction of 2/- per day all round would reduce miners wages to 133$ above tho pre-war level.(2)   That this is equivalent to tho present cost of living as compared with the pro-war figure.(3)   That a fall of 7-J points in tho cost of living is equivalent to a wage of 6d. per day,(4)   That the maintenance of the level of 133^&apos; abovo the pre-war standard would Involve a montnly addition of 3 millions to the offer of the owners,,If this is so, tho  ,10,000,000 would last a littlo over three months *f the cost of living remained at 133..
know, however, that the ua^e reductions proposed arc not uniform, md that some districts would suffer little or no reduction.In any event, therefore, the  10,000,000 would have to be treated as a pool, as it would bo distributed on different bases In different districts, and that in some it would not be required at all.If an upper limit, therefore, wore takon at 133 and a lower limit at 100 on tho understanding that the contribu-tion3 from tho  10,000,000 would fall as tho cost of living fell below 133 it appears to mo that it should be possible to use that sum in aid of tho poorer districts in such a way that it might well last until the end of August.    If the cost of living fell considerably it would last for a longer time.I do not know If Mr. Hodges carries hio Executive or the Delegates with him, but It does appear to mo that his letter affords an opportunity which should not be lost for calling another Conference with a view to the further exploration of the use of the Government contribution as a Pool on the understanding that our liability did not exceed the  10,000,000 proposed.(Sgd)   Christopher Addison.Whitehall Gardens, S.V\ 5th May 1921.
