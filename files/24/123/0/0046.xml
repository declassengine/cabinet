W.-E.The Wae Office,18^ May, 1921.No. X 2159, cipher, 10th May, 1921.Your telegram No. 88883, D.M.O., dated 3rd May.1. I now see my way to continue reduction to 23 battalions, having just returned from visit to Mosul Vilayet. My telegram No. X 2059, 26th April, was sent through prospect of new Lines of Communication, from Baiji through Fathah to Kirkuk, being established much, earlier than was anticipated. Further, I hope High Commissioner will agree to (? dispense with) some detachments in Kirkuk area. The foregoing and some minor adjustments of garrisons on Baghdad Mosul line will provide troops sufficient to hold Mosul and its (?) outposts till levies are ready.2. As regards Mosul, there is no cause for anxiety unless Turks in force should try to retake it. It was never intended, as you are aware, that my troops should be strong enough to meet unaided Turkish aggression on large scale and I (?) presume that promise still holds good.3. As regards levies, Hit and part of the garrison of Ramadi are now actually being relieved, and I anticipate that by some time in June the whole of Upper Euphrates above Fallujah will have been taken over by levies. In the north, 200 Assyrians and some 80 Arabs are total recruits to date. Assyrians are being formed into two companies, one for Dohuk and one for Aqra, and Arabs into one squadron for Telafar. It is improbable that outposts there can be completely replaced before September.(B21/189)  100  5/21  h&amp;s, Ltd.  9210wo
