jgfcjtocument is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government^ -Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1921.ENTIAL.395The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the French Ambassador and has the honour to transmit to his Excellency a memorandum relating to Upper Silesia in reply to the memorandum sent by M. Briand to Mr. Lloyd George on the 14th May.Foreign Office,May 20, 1921.MEMORANDUMHIS Majesty&apos;s Government have given careful consideration to the statements contained in the memorandum on the Silesian question addressed by M. Briand to the Prime Minister on the 14th May. They regard it as of so much importance that disputes should not arise on questions of fact, and that all possible sources of misunderstanding between the French and British Governments should be removed, that they desire without delay to submit the following reply to the above memorandum: 2. The memorandum alleges that His Majesty&apos;s Government have given an inexact account, based upon newspaper reports, of the part played by the Allied troops during the insurrection in Upper Silesia, This is a misapprehension which it is desirable to remove. His Majesty&apos;s Government have formed their views of the situation upon reports, official and unofficial, received from the officials on the spot; and they have no reason to believe that those reports have not correctly repre-sented the facts, which are, in outline, as follows: 3. The insurrectionary movement appears to have come as a complete surprise upon the members of the Plebiscite Commission, who received no warning, notwith-standing the existence of an efficient and highly organised secret service, supposed to be at their disposal. The insurgent forces, which were partly mobilised on the spot and partly came from Poland, crossing the frontier at many points along the eastern border, and supplied with arms and ammunition, drawn partly from local stores and partly from Poland, have occupied the whole area up to the &quot; Korfanty line.&quot; The movement began on the night of the 2nd and 3rd May. The signal for it was given by the publication of a false report that the Commission had allotted the whole industrial area to Germany. It is suggested in M. Briand&apos;s memorandum that this report emanated from German sources; but, in fact, it appeared on the 1st May in special editions of Korfanty&apos;s newspaper, the &quot; Oberschlesische Grenz-zeitung,&quot; which is openly and officially owned by the Polish Plebiscite Commission. The insurgents, who were evidently working on a carefully pre-arranged plan, proceeded systematically to occupy the rural areas and to invest the towns in which the Allied troops were stationed, at the same time destroying a number of railway and other bridges at the western end of the main line of communications connecting Upper Silesia with the neighbouring Prussian territory. The only places where resistance appears to have been made by the Allied troops were as follows: At Tarnowitz, the insurgents were surrounded, by French troops and compelled to lay down their arms. At Kattowitz, French troops opened fire from a tank and killed several insurgents, while a second body were persuaded to withdraw without being fired upon. Italian troops were engaged at Rybnik, - Czerwionka and Gross Strehlitz. and sustained serious casualties. But, speaking generally, some 12,000 troops, equipped with artillery and reinforced by tanks, entirely failed to cope with a movement which the French Government regard as a spontaneous and unprecedented-meditated popular upheaval.4. The reports received by His Majesty&apos;s Government reveal numerous instances in which the British and Italian sections of the Commission, who have, nevertheless,[6260]
continued to co-operate with their French colleagues, have been placed in difficult and even humiliating positions by the failure of the French military authorities to deal adequately with the situation. It is not asserted that it would have been possible to prevent the insurgents, in view of their numbers and the fact that many of them were well-trained and equipped, from occupying a large part of Upper Silesia, and particularly the districts of Pless and Rybnik; but it is difficult to believe that they could have obtained possession of the whole country up to the Korfanty line so -quickly had the majority of the troops made determined and systematic efforts to prevent this. That no such attempt was made is evident. Fraternisation between French troops and insurgents; refusal of French troops to disarm the insurgents when requested to do so by the British Controller at Beuthen; insurgent armed patrols associating with impunity in the streets of Beuthen in the presence of a French force of two tanks and about fifty infantry; difficulties placed by the French chief of the military department in the way of arming the special police recruited to fill up the shortage caused by the desertion of the Polish section of the police force; the withholding of machine guns promised for the defence of Gross Strehlitz : such are some of the incidents as to which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have reliable information.5. Thus the District Controller at Beuthen reported to the Commission on several occasions the existence of an armed post of insurgents within 150 yards of the head-quarters of the 91st Infantry Brigade. No steps were taken to disarm this post, or to remove a Polish flag flying within 60 yards of the French brigade headquarters. Three days before the outbreak, a French company posted at a frontier village in the Beuthen district was removed without the knowledge of the District Controller. At Kattowitz about twenty insurgents, armed with rifles and one machine gun, came into action about 200 yards from a French post, which took no notice. Armed sentries of insurgents were seen standing side by side with sentries of French troops in Kattowitz at the dividing line between zones occupied by the troops and the insurgents. At Tost Gleiwitz a small party of armed insurgents took up a position close to the office of the District Controller, within some 200 yards of barracks in which French troops were quartered. Although the Italian District Controller reported this to the local French Commander, the insurgents were allowed to remain for some twenty-four hours, unmolested by French troops close by, and holding up civilians and even officials of the commission. Arms and ammunition for the police were in charge of French troops at Oppeln, who refused to issue them until it was too late, even on urgent demands made by British officers, with the result that ammunition ran short in the fights at Gross Strehlitz and Kandrzin.6. Finally, on the 12th May, the Italian Commissioner proposed, in commission, that a last effort should be made to clear the country by means of mobile columns consisting of both French and Italian troops accompanied by artillery. General Le Rond refused, on the ground that he could not possibly employ his troops in that way without special authority from Paris. It is not known exactly to- His Majesty&apos;s Government what orders were received from Paris. But it is believed that any action likely to result in violence or collision was expressly forbidden. In the face of these facts it can hardly be maintained that the Commission have, as they publicly proclaimed that they would do, used every means at their disposal for the suppression of the insurrection.7. This account is amply corroborated by the messages from the newspaper correspondents serving the &quot;Times&quot; and the &quot;Morning Post,&quot; journals which cannot be suspected of any bias against either the insurgents or the French troops, or of &quot;any disposition to espouse the interests of Germany as against those of France. Extracts from these papers of the 10th, 11th and 12th May are enclosed. Moreover, these accounts are in harmony with the facts of the situation as they now stand. In the industrial area the towns are occupied by French troops under martial law, the Allied District Controllers having practically no functions to carry out. The police forces of the Commission are entirely out of action, since the Polish sections have joined the insurgents, in most cases&apos; taking their arms and equipment with them after disarming the German sections, of which some members have been carried off into Poland, while others have been interned. Except in the towns of Kattowitz, Beuthen, Gleiwitz and Konigshutte, the insurgents have organised their own Administration, have appointed police and other officials, and have declared martial law, in accordance with which they are carrying out domiciliary searches, requisitions and arrests. Communications with Poland were certainly until quite recently, according to the information in the possession of His Majesty&apos;s Government,
constant and apparently extensive. Insurgent posts are established at frequent intervals on all the roads. British officers are held up at these posts and subjected to formalities from which it appears that French officers, who receive special facilities from the insurgents, are largely exempt. British and Italian officers have been frequently shot at, and are constantly threatened, and in general are only allowed to move about freely if they procure insurgent passes, while French officers are stated to have complete freedom of movement. Work in the factories and the mines is at an almost complete standstill. j8. His Majesty&apos;s Government, while noting- with satisfaction that the French Government have never wavered in the conviction that the only possible solution is to apply the Treaty of Versailles in the letter and in the spirit, must observe that no serious attempt is made in M. Briand&apos;s memorandum to deny that the situation is, in broad outline, as described above, or that it constitutes a deliberate attempt on the part of the Polish faction to frustrate by violence the operation of the treaty, and to defy the Allied Governments. M. Briand&apos;s memorandum, moreover, puts forward a number of suggestions, and contains a number of statements of fact, which His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot regard as well-founded. These points are briefly dealt with seriatim in the following paragraphs.9. Paragraph 2 of the Memorandum. According to the French Government &quot; it cannot be denied that the original cause of the present disturbances was the precipitancy with which the Allied Commissioners were instructed to draw up in a few days and to send to the Supreme Council at London their recommendations as to the partition of Upper Silesia involved by the plebiscite.&quot; This decision was taken on Sunday, the 24th April, at Lympne, during the conference between Mr. Lloyd George and M. Briand. The telegram to the Plebiscite Commission was sent over both their names.10. In the fourth paragraph of M. Briand&apos;s memorandum it is urged that the Commission has not renounced its authority in any respect; and that, if the situation is to improve, it is important that no encouragement should be given by the Allies themselves to the Germans, who are disseminating mendacious and tendencious news, and are organising troops and despatching them to the Silesian frontier. His Majesty&apos;s Government find it difficult to understand how the situation can be properly described in these terms, when the Commission have, over the greater part of the area, been obliged to surrender all administrative authority to the insurgents. On the importance of giving no encouragement to the Germans to break the peace themselves, His Majesty&apos;s Government are, and always have been, in entire agree-ment with the French Government. They have, in fact, spared no effort, both by representations made at Berlin and by advice given to the German Ambassador in London, to impress upon the German Government the imperative necessity of their doing everything both to restrain their partisans and to refrain from setting troops in motion. Whether or not as the result of that advice, both the German population and the German military formations have hitherto remained on the whole commendably quiet under great provocation. Nor has any unusual activity on the part of German agents in disseminating false news been observed. On the contrary, such reports as have been received from German sources have on the whole been remarkably accurate. The same cannot be said of the statements appearing in the Polish press and issued by the Government wireless service from Warsaw.11. Paragraph 5 of the Memorandum. His Majesty&apos;s Government observe with pleasure that the French Government have drawn the serious attention of the German Government to their responsibilities; for His Majesty&apos;s Government attach the utmost importance, as has been explained above, to the maintenance of a passive attitude by the German Government, in the face of whatever provocations. It would give them the same pleasure to learn that the casualties inflicted by the Polish partisans on French troops had moved the French Government to impress the Polish Government also with their responsibility for a movement which has developed under the leadership of an agitator whose expulsion the French and Polish Governments have always opposed.12. Paragraph 5 of the Memorandum. The statement that the population of the mining area has a large Polish majority is an exaggeration. Taking the definition of the mining area laid down in General Lerond&apos;s report, the Polish majority is only hl\ per cent., or some 25,000 in about 800,000. The smallness of this majority would not, of course, in any way justify the German Government in resorting to force to redress the present unlawful acts of violence. But, if regard be had to all the circumstances, it would be difficult, should the German population
in. Upper Silesia resort to force, to convict the German Government of a deliberate violation of the Treaty of Versailles, so long as the Allied Governments acquiesce, in fact if not in words, in a corresponding violation of the treaty in the supposed interests of Poland.13. Paragraph 8 of the Memorandum. The proposal put forward by His Majesty&apos;s Government to ease the present situation appears to have been misunder-stood, to judge from the description of it given by M. Briand. It consisted in allowing the Polish Government and German Government immediately to occupy and administer with full responsibility those parts of the plebiscite area which the-recommendations of the Plebiscite Commission, divergent in other respects, agreed in assigning ultimately to Poland and to Germany respectively, in virtue of their overwhelming Polish and German majorities. His Majesty&apos;s Government remain convinced that, had this proposal been adopted, the Commission and the forces at their disposal, concentrated as they would have been in the disputed area, would have had less difficulty in meeting the storm. But it was rejected on the recom-mendation of the Inter-Allied Military Committee of Versailles, and on grounds not primarily of a military character, which do not appear to His Majesty&apos;s Government to be adequate.14. Paragraph 9 of the Memorandum. The provisional remedy proposed by His Majesty&apos;s Government would not have prejudiced in any way the final partition of the area in accordance with the annex to article 88 of the Treaty of Versailles. His Majesty&apos;s Government have never doubted that the French Government attach importance to strict adherence to the provisions of that annex; and they fail to understand on what ground M. Briand charges them with attributing to the French Government, on the basis of newspaper articles, a policy that consists in assigning the whole industrial area to Poland, if necessary by violence. No such statement has ever been made by His Majesty&apos;s Government either directly or by implication.15. Paragraph 13 of the Memorandum. It is not clear what is the precise bearing of the argument that it is essential to dissociate the Silesian problem from the problem of reparations. The suggestion that secret promises have been made to the German Government to compensate them in Silesia for their acceptance of the demands recently addressed to them from London is not understood. His Majesty&apos;s Government have no knowledge of allegations coming from German sources that such promises were made. In any case, it hardly seems consistent at one and the same time to recommend a proposal, in accordance with which Poland, in connection with the solution of the Silesian problem would assume a share of the German liability for reparations, and to insist upon strenuous resistance to-the contention of the German Government that the two problems are in fact connected.16. The treaty lays down that the fate of Upper Silesia is to be decided in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants, which are to be ascertained as the result of a vote taken by communes. M. Briand will remember that from the beginning it has been the constant aim of His Majesty&apos;s Government to secure the conditions necessary for an equitable decision on that basis. First and foremost among these conditions is impartiality: if either side were led seriously to doubt whether the Allied Commisson and the Allied troops can be relied upon to do inflexible justice, no settlement could be imposed which will be accepted by both sides as an unbiassed execution of the treaty. Unfortunately it cannot be denied that the insurrection, both in its origin and in its course, has given ground for the belief that the Allied Commission^ reputation for impartiality, has not been uniformly sustained. That is why His Majesty&apos;s Government have urged that the French Government should take vigorous action to restore the prestige of the Commission, and. by insisting upon the punishment and expulsion of those responsible for the insurrection, to create an atmosphere in which a just settlement, acceptable to both parties, will be possible.Foreign Office, May 20, 1921.
