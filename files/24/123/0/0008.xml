S5CR3T. CP.2906.1 CP.2840:CP.2829JCab.26(2l) onolusion 2.m IS TflHJ PH0P3RTY 0? HIS BalMlilTC MAJESTY !S GQVBSflttStf T)EMOTIONS IN IR3UIQ. PROIWD Oj^SR OF A TRUCES. Memorandum by Dr. Allison.I earnestly trust that tho Cabinet will a^ain 6ive attention to this raattor which was raised in tho notes previously circulated from the Secretory of State for India and myself .    At the Cabinet Meeting held at the House of Colons on the 21st of April0 it was deoided to proceed with the elections in the south of Ireland as wall aa in the north.     In view, however, of the discussions which would arias in the House of Commons on the following Thursday, April 29th. no decision was reached with regard to the suggested truco.Since that time the consideration of Reparations by Germany has prevented tho further consideration of thisproposal, but I hope that time will now be found for it.iThe oall for it, in my judgment, remains unaltered.(Intd.) CA.2, Whitehall Gardens, SJT.4th May, 1921.
