This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.---- 582SECRET. o2CP 2991.THE CABINET.organization of the turkish gendarmerie porthe ismid peninsulaMEMORANDUM  BY THE  SECRETARY  OF STATE  FOR WAR. With reference to my previous memorandum (CP. 2981) on the Military Situation-^1in Turkey, I circulate the following memorandum by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, British Army in Constantinople.L. W.-E.The Wae Office,Slst May, 1921.21931 should be very grateful if you could get me the support of the Cabinet in the following matter: As you know, brigandage, massacre and burning is seriously on the increase in the area for which I am responsible.   The inhabitants are getting more frightened daily.To combat this, and at the actual instigation of the French, I put forward a scheme to resuscitate the Gendarmerie in the Sandjak of Scutari ie., in the area between the Bosphorus and Ismid.My scheme amounted to raising about 600 gendarmes, of which I have now 150. They were to be commanded by Turkish officers, assisted and advised by British officers. The money required to give them a reasonable rate of pay which would ensure getting the best, amounted to 3,00.0?. per month. The rates proposed were a little less than they would get if they went over to join Mustapha Kemal in fact the rates are really what we propose to pay the future Gendarmerie. All the Allied High Commissioners approved my scheme and I was authorized to proceed with it. Since I left both the French and Italian Governments have gone back on their High Commissioners.I made it perfectly clear that my proposals had nothing whatever to do with the future of the Gendarmerie. They are simply and solely to save the lives of the inhabitants and to maintain law and order. I am quite at a loss to understand the motive of the French and Italian Governments.The fact, however, remains, that we must do ourv best to protect these wretched inhabitants who appeal to me daily from all sides.I hope hi is Majesty&apos;s Government will make it clear to the French and Italian Governments that the responsibility for future onassacres and atrocities in the British area must rest on those Governments and not on the British.Meanwhile I trust His Majesty&apos;s Government will authorize me to proceed with the formation of the Gendarmerie or local levies that I require up to the amount of 3,000?. per month. It may only be for a short time if the Government decide to withdraw, but in any case either to facilitate withdrawal or to show the earnestness of the British it is imperative that we should establish some machinery both in the Ismid and Chanak areas to safeguard the lives of the inhabitants.As you know well, I have not the necessary troops to guard the area and it will be to our everlasting discredit if we abandon these people without an effort.I will guarantee to establish some form of confidence if I am granted the above sum and the services of six British officers to be graded FF. . ,Pending approval, I have taken upon myself the responsibility of instructing Major-General Harden who is acting for me-to proceed with the organization rather(B21/    )   100  5/21   H&amp;s Ltd  9241wo
than break it down, as when I left, the organization was proceeding satisfactorily. The situation honestly does not admit of delay.In&apos; my opinion His Majesty&apos;s Government should press the French and Italian Governments to agree, and the money should come as Sir Adam Black agrees- from Turkish sources, but Sir Adam Black is powerless to grant this money if the other Governments disagree.All I want is a guarantee that His Majesty&apos;s Government will support me if I continue with the organization.C. H. 3Harington, Lieut-General. G.O.C.-in-C, British Army in Constantinople.30th May, 1921.
