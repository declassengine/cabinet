The Home beoretary has circulated to the Cabinet a[9.      memorandum (C.r.2928) dealing with the proposed discussion at &apos; the forthcoming International Labour Conference of a weekly rest day in industry and commerce.The principle of a weekly rest day in industrial life has boen long accepted by custom in this country and the custom is so strong that generally speaking it has almost thd force of law,    A weekly rest day is fixed by legislation for certain classes cf commercial undertakings but not for all. The home Secretary is in favour of the Government supporting^ a convention for the establishment of a weekly rest day for Industrial Undertakings, which would involve subsequently the introduction of legislation to give effect to the Convention,The arguments in favour of tne Convention are(a) that to plead custom as substitution for legislation is a dangerous precedent to set for the International Labour Conference,(b) That it is desirable in the interests of this country that all members of the International Labour Organisation should be equally bound to adopt the weekly rest day,(c) That if the weekly rest day were ordained by statute in this country an impetus would be given to the movement for a weekly rest day in backward countries,
*Legislation might apply either to industrial under-takings only, which would necessitate demarcation between industrial and commercial undertakings, or to all employed persons, in which case controversy would be aroused with respect to prohibition of Sunday trading in commercial establishments.I do not altogether agree with the Home Secretary. Support of the Convention, which would lead to legislation, would involve the Government committing itself to legislation which would be an additional interference by the State in industrial relations in this country without any demand for suoh interference from any of the parties concerned.   Custom is always more elastic than legislation and custom has a real value in industrial relations in&quot;this country.   It does&apos;not appear further that industry in Great Britain has suffered from the laxer Continental view of a weekly rest day. Even although we support-ed a Convention and introduced legislation, and the legislation were also introduced in foreign countries, it by no means follows that such legislation abroad would be effective if it ran counter to long established prejudice or custom,.On the v/hole, therefore, I doubt whether the Government should support a Convention. Legislation is not   necessary in this country, nor is it demanded, and it is not clear that the acceptance of the Convention would secure the beneficial results in foreign countries which the Home Secretary thinks would follow from British example.The principle, however, is valuable, and I accordingly suggest that the.British Government might accept a recommendation from the International Labour Conference on the principle of a weekly rest day, but it should be understood that that recomment dation would not imply necessarily the introduction of legislation^(Initialled)   T.J.M.Ministry of Labour. 25-5-21.
