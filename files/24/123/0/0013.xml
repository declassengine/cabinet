GEMSRAL MILITARY SITUATION,There is no change in the General Situation. Minor outrages and individual inurders continue and there is still an absence of operations on a lart?e scale.There has been another big capture of arms from a rebel Mump&apos; in Dublin,.     This capture &quot; included 52 revolvers, 11 rifles, 11 shot guns, 13,000 rounds of revolver ammunition, 14,000 rounds of shot gun ammunition, and a lerre quantity of explosives end detonators.No other incident during the week calls for any specialnotice.As sn example of the close touch which is nor kept with the doinre of rebel Flying Columns, I attach (Appendix 2) a record of the movement of such cOumns, in the 6th Divisional areas    Similar records ere obtained every reek.    The railway situation remains unchanged.   The destruction of Belfast Goods continues and some minor outrages such as the cutting of telegraph wires have occurred,-     The line from Farranfore to Valentia, Co. Ferry has been closed..     The form of Appendix I, has been slightly altered this reek, so as to show incidents connected with troops only.    This has been done in view of the cumbrous nature the Appendix assumed when every outrage in the country was included.(Sfd.)   C.F.K. MACREADY.GHQ. Ireland. G&apos;: 1TRAL,3/5/21.

APPENDIX   II, I.P.. Movements in 6th. Division. Area,1st. (Lid, Cork) Brigade.This Brigade is in a bad way.   The pest week h: s been more free from robe inactivities than any other for the ppst few months. lst*, Battalion has shown no activity,2nd, Battalion The Comdt. arrested.   This Battalion which supplied mosi of the Murder rang/ has suffered, vary heavy casualties during the past month, and is at present completely disorganised.3rd. Pa.ttalion.   ho longer of any importance.5th,. Eiviraiown Bn. consisting; chiefly of city men has nor practically ceased to exist,4th. Puu   One mail robbery during the week.   Great efforts have been made to work up this Battalion to its former glory, but quite unsuccessfully..6th Bno   Flying Column under KcNeilus driven out of the Donouphmore Area. &apos;Believed to be near hi11street and may undertake an ambush there.7th Bn0 Macroom and 8th Bn. Ballingeary.   No activity,2nd. (North Cork] Brigade.The 1st, Bn. A.S,U. has carried out no Military operations with the exception of damaging a number of bridges over the &quot;liver Bride, including Katheormac Bridge, during vhioh operation, the whole village was invested and the inhabitants confined to their houses.The 3rdo En,, A0SfU* has shown considerable activity in the last few days-,    On the night of tho 15th inst. they are said to have been between Glanworth and Ballyhooly, the Machine Gun Section was apparently detached and told to fire on the Aero-drome in order to create a diversion.   This gun, probably the one which jammed at Castletownroche on 9/3/21, was not firing well on 15/4/21, and had several stoppages before the whole strip was fired*During the night of the 2l/22nd. inst. shots were fired over filworth Camp, a small attack made on Kildorrery RIC* Bks. The railway line pulled up near Ballyhooly, a bridge carrying the Railway over a road near KillavalLen Station damaged and a meeting of some ;tort surprised by Crown Forces at Rathnacarton. A description of Thomas Hunter, no?/ commanding 3rd. Bn. is given in &quot;Information&apos;^In one of tho letters captured at Panteer and dated 14/4/21, the Brigadier Commandant tells the O.C. 5th Bn. to get into touch with him through 0.-C. Rathcoole Cop. the Brigade Hd.Qrs. must therefore be in the vicinity of that village probably in the hills immediately to the South, or even as far south as the Mushera Mountain.Another letter was addressed to 0.0. 5th Benteor Bn. so that Denis Lyons and his gang are apparently in that neighbour-hood,,     The recent round-up at Banteer must have seriously disorganised the Kanturk Battalion, for the 17 arrests made in this operation include some of the most active members of the local Coy.; in addition to three very Important members of the Active Service Section, namely, James Hayes, who has been with the *lying Column since October last, Denis Mulohlnock Ca.pt. Eanteer Coy. and a member of the Flying Column, Martin McGrath, I.R.A. organiser for North Cork and a recent recruit to the Flying Column,An intercepted letter dated 18/4/21 stated that members of tho Flying Colurrn were\e blllettod in Ba llyclogh, arriving there on Saturday loth InsUiin&apos;/.,     This may have &quot;been true,&quot;but if so the rebels left at the beginning of the week, for a search In the early hours cf the 20 Vn inst.. produced nothing.No further information has been received of John Moyla;a?s Newmarket Column, but the recent theft of the Kiskeam telephone
points to its still being in that locality.

3rd. (West Cork) Brigade.

Hales Flying Column.

From information received it is now possible to trace the movements of this column for the past few weeks. After the Cross Barry engagement on the 19th ultime, they went off in a North Westerly direction and spent a few days in the Templemartin Crookstown Area.

About the 24th March they moved South? and crossing the Bandon river concentrated, probably somewhere about Reenascreena for the attack on Roscarberry Barracks, on the 30th ultime. After this attack they moved North to Reenascreena again, where they spent the following day, and then reached the Newcestown area, probably through Rossmoro. No news has been obtained of them for the next ten days, but about the 10th instant they went to Kilbrittain Area, where they mobilised the local volunteers for an attack on Courtmacsherry Detachment, which was probably due for about the 13th or 14th instant.

This however, was given up owing to the military activity in that area, and after spending a couple of days at Howestrand, they again moved off in a Northerly direction on the Sunday morning last, 17th ?. One report states that a part of the Column temporarily broke up to go back and work on their farms, but this is not confirmed.  It would appear, therefore, that the Column is probably up North of the Bandon River again now.

Their strength is about sixty, and they generally move with several country carts.

1st. (West Kerry) Brigade.

Ten armed men raided Ardfert Post Office 22/4/21 and stole £65.

No further information has been received of this Column.

2nd.(East Kerry) Brigade.

The Column has been in the vicinity of Castleisland for some time past,  attempted to ambush a train, carrying a party of troops, between Gortalea and Castleisland on the 19th inst.  It was a very weak attempt and proved this gang to be extremely faint-hearted and cowardly, for although armed with a machine gun in addition to their usual weapons, the rebels took to their heels and ran as soon as the train stopped and the troops detrained. Information has been received from various sources that a rebel concentration is taking place in the neighbourhood of Headford Junction and Barraduff. It is not known what the object of this concentration is, but an ambush is forecasted at Headford Junction, though as the trains are not running it is not apparent what the rebels hope to catch. Members of the Column have been active stealing telephones, etc. The raiding party was last heard of Gneevegullia (4 miles N.E. of Rathmore), 19/4/21. The rebels are reported to drill frequently at Barraduff and to hold meetings at night in the fields.

3rd. Kerry Brigade. No information.

2nd (Mid-Clare) Brigade, I.R.A.

This Column is in the neighbourhood of Corofin. During the past week they attempted to murder Constable Coughlan R.I.C. when cycling near Corofin. They have also been holding up postmen in that neighbourhood.

1st (Mid-Clare) Brigade I.R.A.

The activity of this Brigade in the South of the County has been chiefly confined to collecting rates and cutting roads. About 10 men re? to have met at Dunmore on the night of the 12th instant and collected all the men from the neighbouring
house and trenched the roads between Doonbeg and Kilkee. John Liddy, the Commandant of this Column with Wm. Haugh a member of the Column visited the house of Edward Cullinan, Ballymacurtain Kilrush on the 9th inst. with a view to bombing lorries on the Ennis-Kilrush road, as it is in a very favourable position. John liddy and Thomas Marrinan are reported to be living in a roughly constructed hut in Shreagh Bog. This Flying Column is still expecting help from the Kerry side to attack Crown Forces.

3rd (East) Clare Brigade.

The Column was reported in the Lough Craney District early during the past week, they then moved down south passing through Glendree 4½ miles North of Tulla. 25 of them got into the train for Ennis and probably committed the murder of Sergt. Rew, Royal Scots and wounded one constable and 2 women that night. The following day they commandeered all males coming from Mass and compelled them to trench roads near the village. They then moved south and spent the night of the 18th in the Bunratty district. On the afternoon of the 19th inst. they were seen making north from Bunratty district and are now probably in the country between Newmarket and the River Fergus. Michael Brennan was slightly wounded during the recent encounter with Police and Military at Bohatch. He came to Limerick with his brother Austin about the 7th or 8th and remained in Limerick Station until the 18th, from whence he was seen off by train from Limerick station. He is reported to have stated that he never has to go more than 5 miles away from the scene of an ambush he carried out and that he intends to make it hot for Crown Forces during the coming year. Summer. This information which is very reliable confirms the report in last week&apos;s summary that Austin Brennan was seen in Limerick on the 19th inst. Both of them probably took part in the murder and attack of the John St. R.I.C. on the night of the 8th inst.

1st (Mid) Limerick Brigade I.R.A.

The Active Service Column reported in last week&apos;s summary as being in the Hospital-Kilteely district, is now believed to be in the hills near Caherconlish. It is an Active Service Company of the Mid Limerick Bde. and was responsible for the attack on the Fedamore R.I.C. After the affair at Fedamore the rebels retired via Rockstown and Caherkelly. There is a dug-out in the hills of Caherconlish which has not yet been located. On the 20th instant some of the Columns were seen about 20.30 hrs. prospecting a site for an ambush between Sheehane Cross Roads and Ballyneety on the Bruff-Limerick Road. Thomas Lee son of an N.T. of Castleconnell is a member of this Column.

2nd (East) Limerick Brigade I.R.A.

Pat Brennan of Meelick brother of Michael Brennan is reliably reported to have been appointed Commandant of the West Limerick Bde. A Column has moved North of Abbeyfrale and was last heard of at Devreen near Athea.  A second Column has been formed and was in the Feenagh district during the week-end. They attended Mass there on the 16th inst. and some of them were armed. They numbered about forty and after Mass they proceeded to steal cigarettes.

3rd (West) Limerick Brigade I.R.A.

No. 1 and 2 Columns have been located and are still believed to be in Kerry. Danny Maloney of Lackelly a member of No. 1 Active Service Column was seen in Hospital on the 17th inst. It is believed he has been lent to the Activa Service Company of the Mid Limerick Bde. It has now been established beyond doubt that Justin McCarthy of Kilfinane is working with one of the Active Service Companies of the Brigade. His cousin
Sean McCarthy who is Adjutant of the Brigade only accompanies the A.S. Companies for short periods.

1st (Mid) Tipperary Brigade, I.R.A.

The Flying Column of the Mid Tipperary Bde. has not been located this week. It is believed to be in the hills between Shevry and Laskeen. Its only activity has been the sniping of Shevry and Reskeen R.I.C. Barracks on the 20th instant. Peter Ryan Adjutant of Drumbane Coy. I.R.A. one of the 3 brothers "on the run" has been arrested. James Leahy, the Commandant of the Brigade Column has recently been in the district of Meyne trying to organise an attach on an R.I.C patrol from Templetuchy. The latter are however extremely popular and his efforts have not met with success, so much that the very persons who were to have been crawn into it by Leahy gave away his plans to the R.I.C.

2nd (North) Tipperary Brigade.

The 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 7th Bns. Plying Columns are believed to be on the borders of King&apos;s County and Co.Tipperary. Edward Quinlan of Rescrea Comdt.of the 7th Bn. has been seen in the neighbourhood of his home, Coolnanure, Roscrea. He was there for no good purpose. They have been inactive. The 4th Bn. Flying Column is still in the Arra Mountains, they have kept quiet for the past week. The 5th and 6th Bns. Flying Columns are still in the Kilcommon Mountains. They are reported to have had a fresh supply of immunition as they were short of it before.

3rd (South) Tipperary Brigade. No information.

1st (Kilkenny) Brigade A.S.U. is still in the area South West of Callan. They are reported to be about 40 strong and to be living in dug-outs. They were located between Killarney and Ninemile-house but a search of this area on the 12th inst. revealed nothing. Trenchmere Wood is also reported to be a hiding place.

1st &amp; 2nd Waterford Brigades.

A report was received from Dungarvan on the 18/4/21. that the A.S.U. had gone Eastwards into the Kilmacthomas district. The only indications of this so far, are the held up of the Bank at Kilmacthomas on the 21st inst. and a report that 13 strangers were seen in Waterford on the same ?.

1st (North) Wexford Brigade.  A part of 30-40 rebels were seen drilling on a hill side about ½ mile S.E. of Ballycarney on ?C/4/21. They are believed to be members of the Ferns and Ballycarney companies "on the run".   J. Lawless, Myles Breen, John and James Kelly of No.3 (?erns) Bn. and pat. Kenny of the Ballycarney Coy. No. 1 (Enniscorthy) Bn, are known to be with his gang.  Another of the N. Wexford Flying Columns is believed to be the party of rebels caught drilling at Ballymurphy Co. Carlow when several were killed and captured. This Column is believed to have 5 murders to its discredit.  A Third Column is still in the Area Ballywilliam-Ballyanno St.Mullins (Co.Carlow) strength 3C. They were seen between Taghmon and New Ross on the 10th or 11th instant.
