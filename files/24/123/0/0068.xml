h3is Brit;9 .417Memorandum from French Ambassador toLord Ourzon. May 21. 1921. R.RFT The French Government is informed that, despite thepromises of M. Wirth, whose good intentions appear unques-tionable, German volunteers continue to concentrate on Upper Silesia.    It is to he feared that some action methodically organised from the outside will break out and give rise to very grave problems0This fear of seeing German bands invade the mining area has been used as an argument by the Polish insurgents to justify the maintenance of their own occupation.On the other hand, while the Gorman Government are refusing to pay and feed the workmen in this district, the German Railway Administration is preventing the reestab-lishment of the train service and is causing an even more serious danger of disturbances through famine.in its. anxiety to put an end to the existing situation, the French Government has not ceased during the last two weeks to act with all energy at Warsaw as well as Berlin. They have urged the German and Polish Governments to refrain from all imprudent acts, to eschew all compromising courses, and to cooperate loyally with the French Government. General Le Rond has received definite instructions that the administration of Upper Silesia is to be taken ovor again by the Allied Commission9 in confromity with the terms of the Treaty of Versailles.The conciliatory efforts of the French Government would nevertheless be greatly assisted by the support of the British Representatives at Berlin and at Oppeln.     His Majesty&apos;s Government would hasten the solution of the crisis9 if theywere/
were to request Lord DfA&quot;beriion and Colonel Percival to support the effortn made hy M. Charles Laurent and General Le Rond with a view to effecting simultaneously the dissolution of German hands, which are massing on thefrontier of the plebiscite area, and the dispersal of the polish insurgents and the reestahlishnent of a normalsituation.The Comte de St. Aulaire takes this opportunity of renewing to Lord Ciirzon of Kedleston the assurances of his high consideration.Albert Gate,21st May, 1921.
