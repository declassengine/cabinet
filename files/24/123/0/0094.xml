THIS DODUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT). SECRET.  -CP.-2987. c )CABINET, wUNEMPLOYMENT FULrD - PROPOSALS FOR AVOIDING INSOLVENCY. M .1Ij0:i1^5(&apos;3-rhl^&apos;lthe Chancellor off the Exchequer.I desire to make the following observations on the Memoranda circulated by the Minister of Labour (CP.2975) i 1,   His scheme provides for a Treasury loan up t1  20.000,000. The word &quot;Loan&quot; may give rise to misconception.   Any money which the Treasury advance comes out of the Consolidated Fund and affects the finance of the year in whioh the advance is made precisely as does any other item of Government expenditure.     In view of the unfavourable prospects for the year 1922/23 it is almost impossible to contemplate an advance of  20,000,000 by July 1922.   There will indeed be the utmost difficulty in finding  10,000,000, which is the limit of Treasury advances allowed by the present Act.It is true the Act gives the Treasury power to borrow for such advances;   but with the heavy demands for Housing and Local Loans generally it Is most improbable that the limited funds available for investment in the hands of the National Debt Commissioners (o*g. Post Offioe Savings Bank monies) oould meet that extra drain;   and a market issue for such a purpose is impracticable.2.     I see very strong objection to legislation at the present time to give the Fund new borrowing powers.   On the last occasion on which Unemployment Insurance was before Parliament, the House of Commons - against the expressed view of the Govern-. ment - increased the proposed rate of benefit from 18s. to 20s.We however have sufficient powers to make temporary changes to secure the solvency of the Fundv and aro thus in a position
to reduce tho benefit oven to 13s0 for men and 10b. for women.By Section 9 (6) of the Unemployment insurance Act, 1921, a 153* rate of benefit and the old rate of contribution are restored on 1st July, 1923,3r    The Minister of labour&apos;s scheme would, on his calculations, result in a deficit amounting to  163500,000 at July, 1922* Thereafter he suggests that, assuming normal unemployment after that date and the continuance of the increase of 24. in the joint contribution, the deficit would be paid off in about two years from July 1922, i.e. by July, 1924..Two years I should consider in any case &quot;too long a period and I think that the Fund -ought to be dear by 1st July, 19S39 as obviously thereafter no reliance can be placed on material savings to be effected by reduction of benefit.4.     I suggest that in our present circumstances rates of    ju15s, for men and. 12s* for women, vis;  .he rates in force      /   , up to last March ought to be reverted to at once.     It will ; y not be forgotten that the cost of living has fallen substan-tially since March and is still falling rapidly.There does not seem to ma to be any feasible alternative to the.&apos;15s. benefit, unless we are to adopt a really large increase in contributions - much, heavier than the Minister proposes.    As regrds the latter alternative it could net be maintained for long;   the oombined rate . of contribution for health and unemployment insurance is already very high - from next July it v411 be Is.lid. a week, plus anything we now add:   moreover it   , would involve a heavy direct charge on the Exchequer in respect of a corresponding increase in the Government contribution.* It-2- &apos;.
It will however he essential, ss the Minister of labour proposes, to uso our power now to increase the contribu-tions by Id- (workmen)., and Id, (employer)..The further reform proposed by tho Minister, viz: an extension of the waiting period to six days, is in it-self exceedingly desirable from an administrative and financial point of view,      The Treasury are however advised that it is not possible to effect this without legislation though as the point is doubtful it may be desirable to Ob-tain the opinion of the Law Officers. 5.   The comparison between the Minister of Labour1a proposal and the proposal in this memorandum is t-Eate of benefitContributions7aiting period.Minister of Labourrs18s. (men) 14s.

Tho Minister has assumed l  million a week as the most probable rate for unemployment.   If this proves to be the case the statutory borrowing powers of the irnnd, under the Treasury proposal, might be exhausted making fresh legis-lation inevitable.     But this would not take place until well into 1922 and tho contingency may never arise.If unemployment exceeds 1,250,000 &amp; week we should still have left cn my present suggestion - apart from legis-lation - powers to meet a sudden emergency, &quot;&quot;viz. a further reduction in benefit by 2s a week or a reduction in the period fcr which benefit is payable.. The figures in the second, column above are on the assumption that the waiting period is not increased, to 6 days.     Should it be found possible to make this change, whioh I think, desirable, the figures would be much improved the deficit becoming: - unemployment at 1 000,000 - 1,850,000;   unemployment at 1,250,000 -  9,250,000; unemployment at 1,500,000 -  17,500,000.I must point out that the above observations under-state rather than overstate the seriousness of the problem of the future solvency cf the Fund.   I can only mention two of the more Important consider at I ens -(a) the fund, is not really safe unless it has a margin to meet the statutory liability to return contributions., less benefits received, at oertain ages.   This is a large though undertermlned liability which will be Increased by such measures as increase of contributions and reduction of benefits.(b) the capital of the Fund being exhausted and its income from investments lost, when we get to July 1923, it may well prove that the Fund is no longer solvent on that basis,/ even
even if wo revert to tho 15/- rate of benefit now,There is accordingly the most urgent need that any deficit incurred in 1922 be kept within manageable bounds.7. I observe that the Minister of Labour does notrepeat the,suggest!or; in his memc:?a;idum cf- 3rd May that provision eh said be made for additional benefits for workers who will have exhausted benefit by the end nf June..I assume that in view of the deficit shown the Minister of Labour has abandoned this proposal.   It should however be clearly understood by the Cabinet that the cost of giving benefit- for say 8 weeks or half the period between June and the resumption of benefit in November wcui3 be  5,500,000:   that a similar though perhaps small si; payment in respect of the Mar oh-July 1922 period would follow and that these large sums, unless the scheme is abandoned, must be added to the deficits referred to above* \(Initialled) I\.8.H.Treasury, SoW*28th May, 1921,
