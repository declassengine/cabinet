The Committee was constituted as followsThe Committee were unable to hold a meeting- until .:;ay 6th,strike, and &amp;r, Jfellav,ay!s election.The Committee have borne in mind the direction of the Cabinet that &quot;as a matter of principle, the lost Office must pay its way, due regard being had tc the services rendered by it to all other Government Departments.&quot; (Cabinet 17 (EC) Conclusion 3(1) of j.iarch 31st, 1920). The Memorandum furnished by the Postmaster-General (CP.2704) states that in the financial year 1921 - 82; on the basis of present charges and services, the J-ost Office Fill have a deficit of  3,500,000, and that in the financial year 19E2-2S assuming a continued fall in the cost of living and some revival of trade, it will have a surplus of  200,000.   These figures Include allowances for services rendered b;y and to other Government Departments.The Minister of Transport (in the Chair).The Postmaster-General,The Financial becietar? to the Treasury,The Under Secretary of State for the Colonies.ovving to the coal strike, the threat of a Triple Alliance
It is obvious, therefore, that it will &quot;be necessary to Increase the Post Offioe charges or to reduce services, or both, if roooipts and expenditure are to balanoe.   The Committee understand that the previous estimate of Revenue for 1321-22 may not be realised.   As regards the year 1922-23, they do not consider that much comfort can be derived from the estimated surplus of  200,000 in view of the uncertainty of trade and the possibility of further demands for wage inoreases,PROPOSE!) INCREASES Off BASES.The Committee have carefully considered the proposals made in the Memorandum by the Postmaster-General, and the following statement summarises those proposals, and gives the views of. the Committee upon them.foreign Letters,Number per annum 51,000,000Present -Revenue   r-  610,-000Present rate E-kU for 1 3S30l^d,for eaoh additional ounce    re-warProposed rate 3d, for first ounce plus ijd, for eachaddit i onal ounoo,Estimated increase of Revenue 170,000, allowing fer a 5$ docrease in numbers,An increase in the initial rate to 4d6 plus 2d. for each additional ounce is estimated to yield an additional  130,000, after allowing for a 15$ decrease in numbers. The view of the Treasury is that the rate on foreign letters should be raised from E-gd. to 4d. instead of to 3d. which is the rate proposed by the Post Office,
particularly on the ground that an increase to 5d. would be the proportionate increase based on the pre-var relation between the home and foreign postal rates.   Moreover the increase recommended in other respects by&apos; the Post Office is 100$, whereas this particular increase is only one of 20$On the other hand the Post Office represent that the pre-war rate for foreign letters was admittedly well above cost price.   Moreover a rate of 4d. would be in glaring contrast with rates charged by certain foreign countries, which, at the present rates of exchange are Id. in.the case of Germany and 2-J-d. in the case&apos; of Prance.   Such, a rate would also increase the disability from which British exporters to Spanish-American countries suffer by reason of the arrangement between those countries ana the United States that letters between the United States and Spanish-American countries shall be carried at internal rates varying between Id-, and 2d. per letter.   Further it is possible that a rate of 4d. on letters to neighbouring European countries would give raise to a demand for a special arrangement with such countries which would sacrifice most of the revenue to be expected from the increased charge.On the whole, the Committee think it wise not to over-burden the service to foreign countries in view of the advantage over British traders which traders in Germany and other countries having a depreciated exchange already possess, and in view of the special agreement between the United States and Spani,sh-American countries.   The Treasury kemoerof/
of the Committee docs not wish to maintain his objcc-tions to a rate of 3d. and the Committee therefore recommend :*That the rates on foreign letters should be increased to 3d. for the first ounce plus l^d. for each additional ounce,Number 75,000,000Present Revenue  700,000Pre-war rate Id. per oa.present rate 2d. for the first oz. plus Id. for each additional oz.Proposed rate 2d. for the first oz. plus lid. for eaoh additional oz.Estimated yield  35,000. per annum.The Committee are informed that letters to the United States have, over a considerable period, received the same rate as the Imperial Post.   The Post Offipej&amp;proposals will not affect letters of 1 ounce or less hut will merely impose an extra charge of Id. for each, additional ounce.   Letters addressed to the British Empire will have a preference of Id. per letter over letters addressed to foreign countries, other than the United States of America. The Committee recommend*-That on letters proceeding to the British Empire and the United States of America, the charge for the first ounce should be 2d. (a3 at present) and lid. for each additional ounce.
Number                1 63,000,000F                          Present Revenue  475/000Present rate icL per 2 oz, (pre^mr rate)Proposed rate Id, per 2 02,Estimated increase cf Revenue  265,000 allowing for a 20% reduction in numbers*This rate covers newspapers, circulars, catalogues and similar printedfoatter.    There is at present no distinction between rates on printed papers going to foreigryBcstinaticns and. those, going, to colonial destinations.     It is to be anticipated that complaints will be made by traders whose advertising business will be Interfered with, but the increase is only 100/? over the pre-war rate which is moderate considering the great increase of costs.     The Colonial Office, while&apos; of course not favouring the change, are not prepared to oppose It.The Committee recommendThat the rate on foreign and colonial printed papers should be raised from ^d, for two ounces to Id, for two ounces,IV*   Foreign and Colonial ParoeIs,,Number . 7,500/000Present Revenue  310,000The rate charged to the public is built up of -(i)   British credit;(11)   Credit for Sea Transit;(ill)   out payments&apos; to transit and tormina] I Administrations abroad,,The present British credit averages about lOd,per parcel, which it is proposed to increase to 2/3d,
Estimated increase in Kevenue  .200,000.W*t       *i*ir*ii*e**r   .H   ...... ..... 4mi .The Co?;smi tt.ee understand that the Post Office de-sire tc reconsider their original proposal  for an increase of the &quot;British credit&quot; (that is t o say the charge made for services carried out by the British Post Office) from lOd. to 2/5. which when added to the charges for terminal and transit payments abroad misht result in a total rate which would be almost prohibitive.    A rate of 1/6 would probably cover the out-of-pocket cost of the service, excluding all over-head charges, which would hi-ve to be recovered from other and more remunerative services upon.Vvh.Ieh the traffic would stand a heavier charge.    The Post Office estimate that tho proposed increase to 1/6 per parcel would, result in a nett increase in revenue of  150,000 per annum, the estimated loss of business being considered reduced by the lower charge.The Committee agreed to recommendThat the charge made for British
gorvicea in respect of parcels-277proceeding to the Go Ionic $ endforeign countries should bo raisedfro:n averaacof led. per parcelto an average of l/6d. per parcel.V, Inland PostcardNumber650,000,000Present lie venue 2,700,000Present rate   Id, Proposed rate lyd,Estimated increase of Revenue  1,100.,000,allowing: for a 10% reduction in numbers and some revorsion from postcards to letters^This increase of charge is one of the most con-controversial, and will   arouse the keenest opposition.    It will be attacked by;labour on the ground that the post-card is the poor man(s means of communication, and it will be said to mean ruin to tho Picture Postcard trade, On the other hand the Post Office estimate that at the present moment the difference of Id. between postcard and letter rates leads to a considerable diversion from letter to postcards, and if the Cabinet direction to the effect that the Post Office must pay Its way is to bo carried out this particular increase Is one of the two principal means at hand.The Committee note that an announcement was made In the Budget speech of 1920 of the Government*s intention to raise the rate on inland postcards and notwithstanding its unpopularity/
they recommend: *That the rate on inland postcards should he raised from Id, to lM*VI.Inland Printed Papers.1,100,000,000Present Revenue 2,900,000Pre-war rate&quot;ld0 per 2 osPresent ratevKl* for 1 03, 1 - 2oz.

It will therefore affect not only the Commercial interests-but Municipalities, Trade Unions and&apos; Friendly Societies.     Tho present rate ii* the pre-war rate and even the increase proposed will not cover costs. The Coi:traittee agree to recommend:-That the rate on inland printed papers should he raised from hl0 to Id. for the first ounce, the rates for higher weights remaining as at present.1 oz.

(pre-war rate)Proposed minimum charge 3d.Estimated increase of Revenue    190,,000   allowing for a 10$ drop.The Pre-war rate for inland registration fees has been maintained in order that it should not1&apos; exceed the Foreign rate which was fixed by the Postal Union Congress. The Madrid Congress last autumn agreed to increase the foreign rate and it is therefore open to the Government to raise both the inland and the fcreign rates.     In view of the greatly increased cost of the service the Committee consider that the increase proposed by the Post Office is fully justified and they recommend that:-The minimum charge for registration fees should be raised from 2d, tc 3d.PROPOSED ABOLITION OF SUNDAY SERVICES.The Post Office propose that, with a vie?/ to reducing Post Office expenditure, Sunday collections and deliveries should be abolished.This would,mean the complete suspension (with seme minor exceptions) both of tho sorting and conveyance cf mails and the collection and delivery of letters from midnight Saturday to midnight Sunday and the saving would be about  1,000,000 per annum, *)Qc/o of which would be immediately realisable.The arguments in favour cf this -proposal are that London has no Sunday delivery and in Scotland-   C)   h-.
Sunday deliveries are exceptional;   a considerable proportion cf letterw delivered an Sunday are not opened until Monday and the delay will affect private and domestic, mere than commercial, correspondence;   tho measure will appeal to the advocates of the restriction of Sunday labour, and it will not increase tho number of unemployed bvt will merely involve a reduction of the extra payments for Sunday duty at present made to the Post Office Staff.As against these arguments, the abolition cf Sunday services will no doubt cause a considerable slewing down of the post as regards correspondence posted on Saturday or Sunday.     It will also excite vigorous protest fron many quarters, especially smaller towns, those rural areas which have only one delivery a day, and seaside resorts.     Finally the Post Office Unions will oppose the alteration, as 90$ of the saving will bo made at the expense of the extra emoluments of the Post Offioe StaffrIn addition to the direct saving to the Pest Office the Committee understand that the abolition of Sunday , services will enable at least 3*000 train miles   to be saved every Sunday which will be an indirect economy cf about  160,000 a year.An extremo instance of the inconvenience which Would arise is the delay to cross-country and long distance letters.    A letter posted at Plymouth, for instance, cn Saturday would not bo delivered in Cambridge until Monday evening and in most places north of York until Tuesday morning.The proposed abolition of Sunday services will, no doubt, be extremely unpopular and will cause considerable inconvenience, but it would result in a saving cf approximately  1*000,000 per annum; whilst it must be remembered that other means
such as tho telephone, telegraph and express letter services J will still be available tor urgent communications,,To a certain extent foreign mails will be afiected, since a foreign mail arriving on Saturday night will not be dealt with until Monday *The Committee ha^e considered the alternative schemai       .    &apos; &apos; . . . . .  &quot; . : ;:.   -put forward by the lest Office &quot;by which a wunday collection would be maintained in towns, securing delivery on Monday of correspondence posted on Saturday or Sunday, this would result in a saving of  600,000 per annum,, but the Committeedoubt whether the alternative scheme would give full valuedd:&apos; e/y^a;for the money expended on it, and they prefer the more drastic alternative of total stoppage *In order to meet the complaint that after theabolition of Sunday Services there will be no means by which:*important and urgent communications posted in the Provinceson Sunday can &quot;reach London on Monday morning, the Committee&amp;ave requested the Post Office to consider whether it wouldnot be possible to arrange for the acceptance of expressletters at adequate fees at the Central Pest Offices of thelarge towns during stated hours on Sunday for delivery inLondon or other large towns on Monday morningsThe Committee reoommend:-That the Postmaster-General should beauthorised as soon as possible to abolishSunday collections and deliveries^As regards the announcement of the changes proposed, theCommittee recommend:-That the Postmaster General should be authorised to announce, on introducing the new rates, that the Govern--*ment recognise, that when costs are reduced the user ofthe postal services is entitled to get the benefit, andvthat such reductions as are possible in the rates now imposed will be made as soon as a surplus on the Post Office balance sheet is assured*fSga.)
