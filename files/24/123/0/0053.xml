P. 2948.REPORT BY THE GENERAL OFFICER COLiMAKDIHG-III-CHIEF 01 THE SITUATION IE IRELAHD FOR WEEK EM)IIG 14th May, 1921.I(Circulated &quot;by the Secretary of State for War.)GMiERAL MILITARY SITUATION,During the week the Military Situation has net materially changed, out the week-end has,--&apos;produced a large number of outrages of the most cowardly and cold-blooded nature, in which women and unarmed men have &quot;been done to death by large bodies of aimed rebels,   In order that a clear appreciation of the \7hiteun week-end may be formed, these murders have been shown separately in Appendix I (a).    It has become apparent that, in spite of my many representations, little or nothing is being done to rouse public opinion in England from the complacency with which it views the attacks on military and police patrols when in the execution of their duty;   but I am strongly of opinion that the events of this week-end, involving as they do the murder of civilians, troops, and police engaged in private business or recreation, should not be allowed to pass without wide publicity being given to them by influential members of tlip Government.curing the period Hay J?th to May 12th, operations were carried out in the lullingar-Tulla-znore district.   The operations which took the form of &quot;drives&quot; by Cavalry, were carried out under the orders of the G.O.C. Jth. Division,   Four Cavalry .regiments were employed, assisted by local&apos;Infantry units, and provided with Mobile Wireless Stations.   A different Area was driven each day by the Cavalry, the exits to the Areas being blocked by Infantry piquets,     The Colonel Commandant 3rd. Cav, Bde, was in command of the operation and his column was self-contained as regards supplies etc.     A considerable number of individuals were arrested and arrangements had been made for local police to be available to identify these men on the spot. Although the number of arrested persons retained was not large, about 35&quot;,wanted men were captured.   The operation was particular-ly useful as an experiment to discover the value of cavalry in this kind of work.     The general conduct of the &quot;drives&quot;, the administrative and supply arrangements worked very well and have been a good guide for any future operations of the same kind which it may be desirable to carry out in other areas,    There was practically no opposition to the troops, and the only casualty was one trooper slightly wounded0The nomination of candidates for the new Irish Parliaments on Friday 13th, has been tho most important event of tho week. I all constituonc.es in Southern Ireland, oxoopt Dublin University,
Sinn Fein has had a complete &quot;walk-over&quot;, not one single Unionist, nationalist or Labour Candidate being even nominated for any of the remaining 124 seats.There are only two conclusions to be drawn from these rosuite Either the people of Southern Ireland are solidly republican and support and approve of the Dail 2Jireann&apos;s policy of murder, outrage and boycott, or the gunmen have so terrorized their fellow country-men that no one dare nominate or support an individual whose views are other than republican.     Sinn Fein would have the world believe that the former is the correct conclusion, and that Southern .Ireland is unanimously republican.     This is not the case, though it is probable that Sinn Fein would have obtained a substantial majority had the Elections been contested, and it seems a pity that arrangements were not made to nominate candidates in ordor to farce a contest and ascertaii^/hat proportion of   the electors were prepared to vote for the republican party.The ascendency of the gunmen is amply proved by examination of the lists of individuals nominated for the Southern Parliament -approximately       of whom are important members of the H.fy.Staff of the I.R.A. or of.Brigades in the provinces.   Among the newly nomi** nated members, there is if anything a greater proportion of lead&apos;&apos; ers of flying columns and active service units who are on the run as fugitives from justice, than among the old re-elected memberh of Dail Eireann.. The moderate element as represented by persons like Father t?&apos;Flanagan and John Sweetman, has disappeared.The results of the election in the South have demonstrated that there is only one&apos;question to be dealt with - &quot;Is Ireland to have a Republic or not&quot;?   The people of Southern Ireland have acquiesced either from choice or through fear in the election of individuals who maintain that Ireland is at War with England, who have taken an oath to do all in their power to establish a Republic who maintain that every form of outrage is justifiable against Crown Forces, loyal civilians and Government property.   Until these men understand that they are beaten and that the Republic is imv possible, there can be no hope of moderate people coming forward to discuss a reasonable settlement.The Election has been a &quot;revolver election&quot;.   $0 one btffc extreme republicans have been nominated,   Practioally all tne noiiii^ nated representatives i&apos;f the people in Southern Ireland are man who have taken the oath of the Irish Republican Brotherhood or of thfe Irish Republican&quot;Army.    The greatest publicity should be given to these facts in Great Britain, and quickly, otherwise the public will be led by the very effective system cf Sinn Fein propaganda to believe that the results of the election express the wishes of the Irish people.The task before the troops and police, though difficult (chiefly troing to the impossibility of&apos; differentiating at sight between armed rebels and peaceful civilians) is by no means stupen-dous.   At the outside the drilled and trained men of the I*R.A. amount to 25,000 men,   A &quot;parade state&quot; of the I.R.A.^recently captured, but undated, shows only 4,G76 of which 3,38o arc in    \ . Munstel*B   This figure   is considerably below the estimate formed from other captured documents, but might well represent the number of men with Flying Columns and Active Service Unit3, sometimes referred to in rebel documents as their &quot;Standing Army&quot;.   Vftiatcver the e&amp;act interpretation of this return, there is no doubt that the main obstacles to peace, in Ireland are the individuals who have recently been nominatdd for election to the Southern Parliament, and those who form, the Flying Columns and Active Service Units. The total number of these individuals, is probably pot in excess

Ireland, 17th .Hay, 1921.(Received in the Cabinet Offices, Hay 20th, 192.1.)of the figures given in the return, viz,&quot;MunsUr 3,386Leinster 320Connaught 4r&apos;QUlster 320Dublin 600Once those men are dealt with and once their arms aro captured there will ho some chance of peace in Ireland.On May 14th, an Armoured Car which had escorted a lorry and party of R,A,S.C. to the Apa&amp;toir in Dublin to fetch meat, was captured by rebels whilst stationary at the Abattoir. The rebels numbered about 30.     One of the drivers of the car was shot as he was getting out cf the Car,&apos; and the remainder of the crew were surrounded and compelled to get out of the Car,   The whole party were lined up against the wall and some of their uniforms taken. The rebels, of whom two were dressed&apos;as officers, then got into the car and drove to Mountjoy Prison where their uniforms gained them admission;- Tho rebels dressed as officers were taken to the Governor of the Prison and informed him they had been sent to take a prisoner from Mountjoy to Kilmainhain.   The Governor became sus-picious and the rebels then produced revolvers and locked the Governor in his room,     In the meantime five or oi;: more rebels had gained admission at the gate, holding up the warders with revolvers,     A sentry fired and wounded one rebel, and the,w&amp;ule rebel party, including those dressed as officers then made good their escape in the Car,     The car was subsequently found abandon-ed outside Dublin,     The two Hotohkiss guns and the ammunition had been removed;    the Car was slightly damaged.   A. Court of&apos; Enquiry is being held on the affair.     The whole incident has saused me to consider seriously the adequacy of the personnel at present available for manning the armoured cars, ard I am strongly of opinion that the number of trained men of the Tank Corps in Ireland must be increased if the armoured cars are to reach their full efficiency.     This question has previously been raised by me, and I propose how to send  mother letter to the Far Office asking for the increase which, after consultation with the Officer Commanding the 3rd,, Battalion Tank Corps, I consider necessary. I should be glad if the matter could be treated as urgent,
