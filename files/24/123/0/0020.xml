PART L-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.The most important event of the week has been the suspension of negotiations in the coal dispute, consequent upon the rejection by the miners&apos; national delegate con-ference, on the 28th April, of the Governments offer of a grant of  10,000,000 to mitigate the hardships involved in the proposed reductions in miners&apos; wages. This rejection has been followed during the week-end by meetings of the miners and of the councils of the local associations in various districts, which have expressed approval of the action of the national delegate conference; and there appears to be no likelihood of an early resumption of negotiations. Public discussion of the principles involved in the dispute, however, continues, and a further letter from Sir W. H. Beveridge appeared in the Times of the 3rd May, in which he suggested, inter alia, the appointment by the Government of a commission of three or five independent persons to make proposals for the permanent management of the coal industry, the Government undertaking to carry out the recom-mendations of such a commission, reserving only the right of suspending action on political issues of supreme importance until after a general election, and the miners&apos; undertaking to resume work on the appointment of the commission. Meanwhile unemployment continues rapidly to increase, almost every industry being now affected. The consequent falling-off in goods traffic has led to the suspension on the railways of the &quot; guaranteed week &quot; ; similar action on some of the local tramway undertakings is also reported. The position as regards sympathetic action which, up to the present, has been distinguished by its mildness has not materially changed since last week, although an unofficial agitation is being carried on in various parts of the country, especially amongst railway men and transport workers, with a view to securing the adoption of a more militant policy. In view of the expiry of the Proclamation of Emergency issued on the 31st March, a further Proclamation was issued on the 30th April, and the emergency regulations which expired on the latter date have also been renewed.Important negotiations, concerning proposed reductions of wages, which have been somewhat overshadowed by the coal dispute, are in progress in the building and engineering trades. In connection with the latter, a decision of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades, the National Union of Foundry Workers and the National Federation of General Workers, to negotiate in future with the engineering employers jointly and as one body, is of some importance. These unions are offering strong opposition to the engineering employers&apos; proposals, although a recent ballot of the members of the shipbuilding unions on the reduction proposals of the ship-building employers has resulted in a majority in favour of acceptance. It may be observed, however, that the reductions at present proposed by the engineering employers are much heavier than those accepted by the shipbuilding unions. Important negotiations are also pending in the cotton industry, where the present wages agreements are about to expire, and it is reported that in this industry also substantial reductions in wages will be proposed by the employers.An account is given below of the national conference of Labour women at Manchester on the 27th and 28th April. The usual May-Day Labour demonstrations were held in various parts of the country, and passed off quietly. The annual conference of the Union of Post Office Workers will be held at Edinburgh from the 10th to the 13th May, at which, inter alia, the ballot vote of members in favour of the adoption of a strike policy will be discussed.The Unemployment Position.Statistics-Oil the 22nd April, in the United Kingdom, 1,711,135 unemployment books under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and out-of-work donation policies, remained lodged for workers totally unemployed, of which 1,232,128 were lodged by
General Situation-continued.males and 479,007 by females. At the same date 1,009,843 unemployment books and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers on short time, of which 496,533 were lodged by males and 513,310 by females.These figures show an increase on the previous week of 88,280 totally unemployed and 28,987 working short time.The total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 29th April was 1,865,753. The above are advance figures provided by the Employ -ment Department and are subject to revision.A full analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 405.FEATURES OF THE WEEK.General Topics.Sympathetic Action by Trade Unions in Support of the Miners.-The question of sympathetic strike action in support of the miners has been raised J^y the Scottish Union of Dock Labourers and Transport Workers, who have passed a resolution requesting that a Triple Alliance delegate conference should be called to consider the advisability of immediate strike action. In the event of the co-operation of the railway workers not being secured, it is suggested that the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation should act on their own initiative. This request is to be considered at the next meeting of the national executive of the Federation. At a mass meeting of miners held at Sheffield on the 29th April, a suggestion was put forward that efforts should be made to secure a strike of railwaymen and transport workers on the 15th May, and this suggestion is also supported by the National Workers&apos; Committee movement. With regard to the instructions issued last week by the executives of the National Union of Railwaymen and the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, it is reported that transport workers in various parts of the country have refused to unload coal or to bunker ships. Dockers employed at the Bristol City Docks struck on the 2nd May because a ship arrived from Antwerp bunkered with coal from abroad; they resumed work on the 3rd May, but declared that they would not touch any ship worked with foreign coal against the interests of the British miners. At Yarmouth and at Ipswich the dockers refused to unload coal, and the work was per-formed by volunteers and by non-union labour. Dockers employed on the Clyde have refused to unload five cargoes of coal from Cardiff, and labourers on the Manchester Ship Canal have refused to load the cargo of a ship which, it is alleged, was bunkered with Belgian coal loaded by Asiatic labour. A further manifesto has been issued by the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation urging the members to adhere to the policy laid down, and to block the movement of foreign coal. It is also stated that seamen and firemen have been asked to refuse to sail in ships carrying coal from the Continent or America to this country.Mr. Eobert Williams issued, on the 2nd May, an official statement indicating the support which Continental dock workers are prepared to give to the British miners. He stated that M. Edo Fimmen, secretary of the International Transport Workers&apos; Federation, had given every guarantee that Dutch, French, Belgian, German and Austrian workers would try to prevent exports of coal to Great Britain.The executive council of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen met on the 2nd May to consider what action should be taken to support the miners, but no announcement of their decision has yet been issued. The joint committee of the Parlia-mentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, the National Executive of the Labour Party and the Parliamentary Labour Party issued, on the 3rd May, a manifesto stating that the Government and the mineowners have declared war on the miners, and are determined that the spirit of the men shall be broken by starvation. Organised labour is urged to defeat such strategy by rallying to help the miners now, as immediate action is necessary. &apos; All sections of the Labour movement are asked : (1) To subscribe freely towards funds for supporting the miners&apos; families.(2) To give and lend money as freely as possible to the Miners&apos; Federation.(3) To see to it that local authorities put into immediate operation the provisions of the Act for the feeding of school children.(4) To urge members of Parliament to put pressure on the Government to offer terms which guarantee that wages shall in no case be reduced below a reasonable standard, having regard to the cost of living.
Features of the Week--continued.The co-operative societies in the mining districts are still continuing their policy of assisting the county associations by acknowledging trading vouchers; gifts and loans are also being received from various unions. The Irish Transport Workers&apos; Union and the Union of Post Office Workers have each sent  1,000 to assist the miners ; and the Cardiff branch of the National Union of Railwaymen urge that a grant of  25,000 should be made at once. Further financial assistance is also being given by the National Union of General Workers.Suspension of the Guaranteed Week for Railwaymen and other Workers. The guaran-teed week agreement of the 27th March, 1919,* provides that, in the event of a strike affecting the work of any grade of railway employees, the suspension of the guaranteed week shall be referred to a committee representing the railway managers, the National Union of Railwaymen and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen. The representatives of these bodies met on the 26th April to consider the situation arising out of the coal dispute; and it has now been agreed that the guaranteed week shall be suspended from the 2nd May, and restored not later than seven days after the official date of termination of the dispute, provided that each man shall have not less than three days work each week.Similar standard conditions prevail in the tramway industry, and a local agreement for suspension is reported from Sheffield. It will be remembered that at the time of the coal strike last year this question gave rise to serious trouble in the Potteries and in Lancashire.!Cotton Reconstruction Board. At a meeting of the Board held in Manchester on the 29th April, it was stated that, as the funds are now practically exhausted, no further benefit to unemployed cotton operatives can be paid after the 7th May. In the official report issued after the meeting, it was stated that the fund had been more rapidly depleted than was at first anticipated, owing to the continued depression in the cotton textile industry, and the increasing number of claims which were being received as a result of the dispute in the mining industry. It is estimated that over  1,000,000 has been paid in the form of unemployment benefit since the scheme came into operation on the 10th January.A &quot; Furnishing Guild.&quot; A mass meeting of workers in the furniture trades in the Manchester area is reported during the week ending the 30th April. Mr. H. Franklin, chairman of the Building Guild, Ltd., presided, and Mr. S. G. Hobson delivered an address in which he outlined the history of the Building Guild, Ltd., and suggested the desirability of close co-operation between that guild and the proposed furnishing guild. Apparently the plan is that the one guild should build, and the other furnish, the houses for which, Mr. Hobson believes, &quot; 250,000 young couples in Great Britain are waiting.&quot; A resolution was adopted unanimously,*in favour of the formation of a furnishing guild.Mr. Franklin and Mr. Hobson also addressed a meeting on the 2nd May of the Man-chester branch of the Amalgamated Society of Wheelwrights, Smiths and Motor Body Makers, and secured the appointment of a committee to inquire into the practicability of applying guild principles to their work. It is proposed to ask the packing-case makers to take a similar step, but the exact connection between these several approaches to wood-workers of various kinds is not clear.Industrial and Other Organisations.National Conference of Labour Women. A conference under this title was held in Manchester on the 27th and 28th April, under the auspices of the National Labour Party. The conference was organised by the Standing Joint Committee of Industrial Women&apos;s Organisations f attached to that party. Some 500 delegates are said to have been present, as compared with 410 at the similar meeting last year. They were principally representa-tive of the women&apos;s sections of local Labour Parties, but also included delegates from national Labour organisations containing women members, who are affiliated to the Labour Party or to the Standing Joint Committee.  Miss Margaret Bondfield presided.The most important decision of the conference was the passing of a resolution by 210 votes to 156 embodying a recommendation that the constitution of the National Labour Party should be amended so as to provide that the four women members of the National Executive should be nominated by the women&apos;s sections of local Labour Parties, and elected at the annual national conference of Labour women by the delegates of the women&apos;s sections. This resolution was carried against the opposition of Dr. Marion Phillips, the chief woman officer of the Labour Party.* See.the Labour Gazette, April, 1919, p. 125.f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 20,13th November, p. 557, and No. 21, 20th November, p. 585. j For the constitution of this body, see the Labour Gazette, July, 1920, p. 358.
Features of the Week-continued.The conference spent much of their time in discussing resolutions on political questions of a general character, for example, on foreign policy, Ireland and unemployment.Resolutions of a more practical nature were adopted calling upon the Government to introduce immediately legislation giving effect to the provisions of the so-called Maternity Convention adopted by the Washington International Labour Conference, and to set up, without delay, Trade Boards in all industries where the workers demanded such protec-tion; condemning the &quot; apathy of the Government with regard to the amendment of the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act,&quot; demanding that the Hours of Employment Bill should provide that the hours of attendance at continuation schools be included within the normal working day and week, and embodying the views of the Association of Women Clerks and Secretaries on the grievances of women in the Civil Service.Labour Party Annual Conference. The twenty-first annual conference of the National Labour Party will meet at Brighton from the 21st to the 24th June. The preliminary agenda showing the various resolutions put forward by the affiliated organisations has been issued. In addition to the general resolutions on political subjects, the agenda indicates that decisions of importance may be taken with regard to more domestic matters, such as the position of women&apos;s organisations within the party ; the financial relations between the national trade unions and the local organisations, and the system of choosing Parlia-mentary candidates, and the affiliation of the party to the second International and its attitude towards the Communist Party of Great Britain. The conduct of the Parlia-mentary Labour Party is condemned, particularly with regard to its attitude towards the question of German reparations.National Union of Agricultural Workers. A conference between the executive of this union and its local organisers and officials was held in London on the 27th, 28th, and 29th April. The only decision which has been reported was one &quot; to resist extensions of the working day.&quot; The purpose of the conference was apparently to secure coherence and unanimity among the national and local leaders with regard to all the questions with which the union are concerned. Mr. R. B. Walker, the general secretary, has expressed the following opinion with regard to the conference : &quot; We have created a machine which, when the testing time comes, will be well able to withstand any attacks made upon agricultural workers.&quot;NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Builders (National).-The National Wages and Conditions Council for the Building Trades, which adjourned on the 22nd April,* reassembles in London on the 5th and 6th May.It. is reported that the building trades operatives in Carlisle threatened to cease work on the 30th April, in consequence of the employers having notified their intention to put a sliding-scale reduction of wages into force on the 1st May. The employers met on the 29th April, and have decided to await the deliberations of the National Wages and Conditions Council before putting their intentions into operation. In view of this decision the threatened stoppage has been averted.At Liverpool, an agreement has been reached whereby the present hours, wages and conditions are continued until the 1st August next, unless bunding trade wages in the north-western area are reduced before that date. In the meantime, a Joint Conciliation Council is being set up, which will have to consider the position on the 1st August in the light of any reductions, or proposed reductions, in the rest of the north-western area, and to decide whether such changes shall affect Liverpool.Similar agreements have been reached in the Liverpool sawmilling industry and the Liverpool furnishing trade.Engineers (National).-A national delegate conference of the Amalgamated Engineer-ing Union was held in London on the 26th and 27th April to consider a communication from the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations relating to the embargo
Negotiations and Disputes-continued,placed on overtime by the district committees of the union, and to the proposed reductions in wages of 6s. per week on time-rates and 15 per cent, on piece-rates, together with the abolition of the 121 per cent, and 7j per cent, bonuses. Confidence in the executive was expressed by the conference, and approval was given to the methods which have been adopted to resist the employers&apos; proposals for wage reductions. On the 29th April, the union executive again met the employers&apos; federations with regard to the above questions, but no material progress was made, and the meeting was adjourned to a date to be decided later.Transport Workers (Lancashire).-With. reference to the notice of a reduction of wages operating on the 1st May, which was given by the Lancashire federation of local transport associations, to the United Road Transport Workers&apos; Association of England, and the United Vehicle Workers/ it is reported that the employers have agreed to hold a conference with the United Vehicle Workers, and it is expected that this will take place shortly. The employers are stated to have received no communication from the United Road Transport Workers&apos; Association, but they are notifying this association of the proposed conference.Cotton- Textile Workers (Lancashire). The agreements in the cotton industry between the employers&apos; associations and the unions come to an end on the 6th May, and it is understood that the employers will then give the required notice to terminate the agreement a month later. The employers&apos; associations are now considering the matter, and it is anticipated that they will propose substantial reductions of wages. At present the operatives are receiving 215 per cent, on list prices, only 5 percent, of which was in opera-tion before the commencement of the war.Cinema Employees (Scotland).-At the session of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, held in Aberdeen last week, a resolution was adopted approving and recommending &quot; all affiliated unions to support the efforts of the Actors&apos; Association, the Variety Artistes&apos; Federation, the Amalgamated Musicians&apos; Union and the National Association of Theatrical Employees to unionise every place of amusement in the United Kingdom.&quot;It is reported that in trade union circles in Scotland, the resolution is regarded as an attempt, inter alia, to render nugatory the negotiations which were almost concluded between the Scottish Cinema Owners&apos; Association and the Electrical Trades Union. The question has been referred to the Parliamentary Committee of the Congress by the district secretary of the Electrical Trades Union, and as strong influences are being brought to bear on the matter, it is confidently anticipated by the union that the resolution will be superseded.The question of wages reductions has been the subject of a conference between the Scottish Cinema Owners&apos; Association and the Amalgamated Musicians&apos; Union. The employers have made amended proposals which were to be submitted to a mass meeting of the members of the union which was to be held on the 1st May. Failing acceptance of these proposals by members of the union, the question is to be referred to the Entertain-ments Joint Industrial Council.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Coal Miners (National).-The following is an outline of the main developments of the week directly affecting this dispute.On the 27th April, a meeting was held between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the miners&apos; leaders, when the position disclosed under the new set of figures submitted by the coal owners on the preceding day, and the question of a uniform flat wage rate reduc-tion, were discussed. The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested a wages reduction of 3s. a day on a uniform national basis, but the miners&apos; representatives showed no disposition to accept this proposal.On the 28th April the parties met again, and at this meeting, the Chancellor submitted the Governments final offer, of which the following is a summary ;-(1) A grant of  10,000,000.(2) No greater reduction in wages during May than 3s. per shift, or in June than 3s. Qd.(3) The remainder of the Governments grant after these safeguards were provided for is to be applied, two-thirds in July and one-third in August, to improvement of the wage conditions in the districts most requiring it.(4) The Government to facilitate, if the miners so decide, the operation of the grant so that the reduction in all districts would be uniform.
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.(5) In that case, in some districts the miners would receive less than the owners would be willing to give.(6) The owners had consented to the collection by the Government of surplus wages in such districts and their distribution in the districts more hardly hit.(7) The proposals of the Government to be dependent on the condition that a durable settlement should be made, which would last one year from the end of the temporary settlement, and afterwards be terminable by three months&apos; notice from either side.(8) The national pool is considered by the Government to be a political issue involving legisla-tion.At the conclusion of the meeting the miners&apos; executive laid the above offer before the National Delegate Conference, who passed the following resolution, practically unanimously: &quot; That this conference rejects the Government proposals as they do not concede the fundamental principles of a National Wages Board and a National Pool for which we stand.&quot;The representatives of both owners and miners returned to their districts during the week-end, and reports show that there is as yet no inclination on either side to give up the struggle.The national executive of the General Federation of Colliery Firemen&apos;s, Examiners&apos;, and Deputies&apos; Associations of Great Britain met representatives of the Mining Association on the 27th April to discuss the position of safety men and their relation to the wages negotiations now in progress.* No detailed account of the proceedings has been issued, but the general secretary of the Federation stated &quot; that his executive were, so far, satisfied with the result of the meeting, a report of which would be sent to the Associations affiliated to the Federation.&quot;Lead Miners (Leadhills).-IXm dispute continues.f A mass meeting of the miners was held at Leadhills on the 23rd April, when a resolution was passed to the effect that the miners consider that the time has now arrived when the Leadhills Mining Company should say whether or not they intend to work the mines. If they do not so intend, the workers themselves are prepared to take them over and work them on the co-operative system.Settlements and Agreements.Shipbuilders (National). The ballot of the men in connection with the agreement reached at the conference at Carlisle on the 19th April J between the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation and the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades, respecting the withdrawal in two instalments of the 1920 advances, has resulted in the acceptance of the proposals by 45,169 votes to 35,913.Woollen Textile Workers (Scotland). The executive committee of the Scottish Woollen Trade Employers&apos; Association have now provisionally agreed that no action respecting a reduction of wages for the six months commencing the 1st July next shall be taken during the currency of the coal dispute.Indiarubber Workers. At a mass meeting of members of the Amalgamated Society of Indiarubber, Cable and Asbestos Workers held on the 28th April, the following reduc-tions of wages proposed by the employers through the medium of the Indiarubber Manu-facturers&apos; Association were agreed to : 10 per cent, from the total weekly earnings of male workers on both time-work and piece-work; 5s. from the total weekly earnings of all women workers aged 18 years and upwards; and 2s. Qd. from the total weekly earnings of all girls under. 18 years of age. These rates will come into operation on the first full pay-day in May.It is provided that the reductions shall not operate to reduce the wages of male workers aged 21 years and over below 52s. Gd. per week of 47 hours, or, in the case of women workers of 18 years and over, below 27s. Qd. per full week of 47 hours. The employers have also agreed that no further reductions shall take place within three months from the date of this reduction.[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Industrial Relations Departments section of the Report, pages 400 to 403.]* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 18, 30th April, p. 382. f See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 11,12th March, p. 255. f See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 18, 30th April, p. 380.
PART IL-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DEPARTMENT.ENGINEERING, SHIPBUILDING AND ALLIED TRADES.Optical Instruments. The Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee met on the 27th April. It was announced that the trade union side had decided to limit their repre-sentatives to six-five representing the Amalgamated Engineering Union; and one the National Federation of Women Workers. The representatives of the Amalgamated Engineering Union would be composed of three from the shops, one from the London District Committee, and the organising district delegate.The organising district delegate stated, on behalf of the trade union side, that they had considered the proposals to reduce wages by 11 h per cent., and that no reduction could be accepted at present. The employers stated that they must meet to consider their line of action, which would be announced at a meeting of the committee on the 11th May.Instrument Makers (Walton-on-TJiames). As a result of the intervention by the Chief Conciliation Officer. London, in the dispute at the works of Messrs. Claudius Ash, Sons &amp; Co., Ltd., one of the directors met a representative of the Amalgamated Engineering Union to discuss the matter on the 25th April. The firm are now lexpected to meet the union in conference.WOODWORKING AND FURNISHING.Cooperage. The quarterly meeting of the Industrial Council was held on the 26th April. It was decided to abandon the attempt to formulate a special scheme for contracting out of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920. A proposal by the employers that the craft unions should be thrown open to all classes of operatives in the industry was referred to the District Councils. Wages in this industry are stabilised until the end of July, under an agreement made last January, but the employers suggested that the operatives should consider whether some earlier modification of rates might not be to the benefit of both workers and employers. The operatives, however, were unable to agree that any conceivable reduction in wages would tend to increase output, as the demand for barrels depended entirely on the state of other trades. The question was accordingly dropped.Upholsterers (London). At a joint meeting on the 20th April, Messrs. Hart &amp; Sons submitted a further offer* to the effect that wages should be the piece-work rates of July, 1914, plus 10 per cent., plus 5 per cent., plus 123J per cent., on condition that no shop had to increase present prices by paying this rate. It was agreed that this offer should be without prejudice to the operation of the clause of the working rules which provides for a meeting of the employers and union delegates at any time to deal with any cases of unduly low prices. The union representatives undertook to recommend these terms to a mass meeting of their members.A further meeting of the Conciliation Board was held on the 25th April. The workers&apos; representative stated that a mass meeting of his members had refused to agree to the conditions offered by the employers, and had instructed the delegates that nothing less than the second 10 per cent, could be accepted. After considerable discussion the employers agreed to accept the following formula.(1) Pre-war log, plus 10 per cent., plus 10 per cent., plus 123  per cent., with the proviso that no prices be raised thereby ; and the formula to operate,without prejudice to,the working rules.(2) That this formula shall apply to all jobs which have come into existence since the 1st July, 1914, and that revision shall be made in accordance with same.(3) That this formula apply to Messrs. Hart, and also to those firms who have paid the unofficial advance.
BUILDING AND WORKS OF CONSTRUCTION.Heating and Domestic Engineers. The Emergency Committee of the Industrial Council met on the 26th April, to consider steps to overcome the difficulties arising out of the demarcation dispute between the National Union of Heating and Domestic Engineers and the Operative Plumbers&apos; Society. It was decided that the Minister of Labour should again be urged to appoint a Court of Inquiry under the Industrial Courts Act.MINING AND QUARRYING.Quarrying^Tke Sectional Council for the Chalk Quarrying Industry met on the 26th April to consider what action should be taken with regard to the wages agreement expiring on the 4th May. The agreement was extended for a further week, in order that the unions and employers concerned might consider a proposal that the last advance of lid. per hour be withdrawn, and that the agreement, as altered, be current for a further period of at least three months, and until the expiry of one month&apos;s notice given by either side at any time after two months.The Freestone Section met on the 28th April, to consider a recommendation of the sub-committee appointed to consider an application to the Yorkshire Area Council for an increase of 4d. per hour for masons and labourers. The committee reported that they had agreed to recommend to their respective members, and also to the National Freestone Council, that in adopting the sliding scale put forward by the building trade industry, it should be provided that from the 1st May, 1921, the first reduction be 3d. per hour. It appears that the offer was declined, and the meeting thereupon terminated.FOOD AND DRINK.Scottish Baking. At a meeting of the Council on the 26th April, the president of the union stated that their executive committee had unanimously rejected the employers&apos; counter-proposals. Proposals were submitted by the union representatives, providing for certain increases in wages, the new rates to be stabilised until October, 1921. The chairman, on behalf of the employers, stated that no proposals for increases could be entertained.The employers&apos; side then proposed that the rates paid in June, 1920, should be main-tained until the 1st November, wages then to be altered on the basis of Is. per week for every 5 points variation in the cost-of-living index number, the resultant wages to be maintained for the next six months. The Council eventually decided that the members of the union should be ballotted on this last proposal. The circular to the members is to be drawn up by a sub-committee of the Council, and is to contain no recommendation in either direction.The employers proposed that the hours should vary from 44 to 47 per week according to the number of ovens in each bakehouse. The operatives unanimously insisted that the present 44-hour week must remain.The Glasgow Master Bakers&apos; Association have persisted in their withdrawal from the Council, and it is understood that they contemplate offering, on certain conditions, terms better than those contained in the old National Agreement.Fishing Industry (Milford Haven). The trawler owners have arrived at an agreement with the Milford Haven Amalgamated Steam Trawlers Engineers&apos; Union. The owners&apos; policy has been to deal with this local union while ignoring the National Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Union. They have also tried to persuade the skippers and mates to secede from the national union, and to join a local union now being formed. The position of the national union is also affected by a break-away of their own members.As a result of further efforts by the Chief Conciliation Officer, a meeting of the Concilia-tion Board was held on the 28th April and adjourned until the 2nd May. A general agree-ment on the lines of that arrived at with the local union is expected.POTTERY, RUBBER AND GLASS.Glass. A special meeting of the Executive Committee of the Industrial Council, on the 26th April, considered the future of the Council. The committee had been given powers to co-opt, and the Assistant Secretary of the Industrial Relations Department had arranged to be present, at the request of the Council. After a very full discussion on the advisability of continuing the Council, the chairman and the vice-chairman volunteered to act as joint secretaries to the Council for a year without emolument. If this proposal is accepted by the Council on the 6th May, and if those unions who have resigned Teconsider their decision, there is every hope that the Council may be kept in being.
SPELTER AND LEAD MANUFACTURE.Lead Manufacturing. The Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee, on the 27th April, considered a proposal by the employers to reduce wages by Z\d. per hour. The employers eventually proposed that wages remain as at present until the 1st May ; that, on the 1st June, the standard wages of Is. Gld., Is. ok/, and Is. Aid., according to the grading of the towns, be reduced by Hd. per hour, with a further reduction of lid. on the 1st July, provided that no firm be asked to increase their wages, and that no worker be expected to submit to a total reduction of more than 3d. per hour. The meeting was adjourned until the 10th May.PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND PUBLIC UTILITY SERVICES.Local Authorities&apos; Administrative, Technical and Clerical Services (England and Wales).  The National Council met on the 28th April. Letters, reporting withdrawal from the Council, were received from the Association of Municipal Corporations and the Urban District Councils&apos; Association. An appeal was therefore made to the Ministry to convene a meeting of the employers&apos; associations at an early date, to reconstitute the Council on a more satisfactory basis. The Council adjourned sine die, but the chairman, vice-chairman, and secretary were authorised to take any necessary action to call a further meeting.Tramways.-The Joint Industrial Council met on the 28th April. The report of the Court of Inquiry was considered. The trade union side were prepared to accept all the Courfs recommendations, but the recommendation relating to the stabilisation of wages until the 31st December could not be accepted by the employers as it stood. It was resolved that the report and recommendations of the Court be referred to a joint com-mittee, consisting of five members from each side, with instructions to report on the 9th June. It was resolved that employees who completed 12 months&apos; service within the holiday period should be entitled to eight days&apos; holiday with pay in the current year, and that a letter be sent out to all undertakings and District Councils urging that steps be taken to set up works committees, where such do not already exist.MISCELLANEOUS TRADES.Tailors and Tailoresses (London). The employers are still unwilling to refer this difference to arbitration&apos; and, at a meeting of the executives of the unions on the 27th April, it was decided that the unions would not consent to re-open the question of a reduction at the Conciliation Board. It is understood that the London employers&apos; association have decided not to reduce rates at present, but to appoint a committee to explore the necessity for reductions to secure orders.Needle, Fish-Hook, Fishing Tackle and Allied Trades-The Wages Committee of the Industrial Council, on the 18th April, considered a reduction in wages. The unions agreed to recommend the acceptance of the scale finally put forward by the employers, on the understanding that piece-prices would not be altered except in the event of any price being out of proportion to the day rate, when the matter would be dealt with by the firm and the union concerned. This was agreed to. The reduction proposed affects a war bonus, as distinct from basic rates, and ranges in the case of men from 4s. to 9s. 6d., according to age. Youths&apos; advances are reduced by approximately 5s., and those paid to boys under 16 remain as heretofore. As regards women and girls, the reduction averages 2s. Colonel Milward stated that, if the workers accepted these terms, he would re-establish the rates for youths and boys operative under the agreement of May, 1920. It was resolved that the reductions should not apply to the workpeople of firms who had not yet put the grading scheme into operation, or until arrears due under the scheme had been paid.  The Council adopted the report on the 19th April.Hospital Workers (London). The department have been conducting negotiations between the British Hospitals&apos; Association and the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union. The union have now forwarded to the department, for submission to the London Regional Committee of the association, a schedule of minimum rates and conditions of labour for the London hospitals. The schedule proposes a minimum of  3 and 35s. per week respectively for adult male and female workers not employed on special work. Separate scales of minimum rates varying from  3 10s. to  5 10s. are asked for specialised workers, such as laboratory attendants, fumigators, inquiry clerks and assistant dispensers.
GENERAL DEPARTMENT.TRADE BOARDS.PROCEEDINGS.Jute Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board resolved to withdraw their Notice pro-posing to vary the general minimum time-rates by a reduction of 20 per cent., and to issue a fresh Notice proposing to vary all general minimum time-rates and overtime rates by a reduction of 20 per cent., of which 12-  per cent, should operate for a period of. four months, the full 20 per cent, reduction to operate thereafter ; and, further, to withdraw the Board&apos;s * Notice propos ng to fix general minimum piece-rates for female hessian weavers, and to issue a fresh Notice making corresponding alterations to those made in the Notice affecting general minimum time-rates.Made-up Textiles Trade Board (Great Britain).-Tl\Q Board agreed that the fixing of the proposed rates as set out in their Notice dated the 3rd February, 1921, should be deferred for three months on account of the extreme depression in trade.It was agreed that, in view of the depression in trade, it should be suggested to the members of the Oilskin Clothing Manufacturers&apos; Association that they should try to arrange for their employees when on short time to work three full days a week and go on unemploy-ment pay for the remainder of the week, in preference to working part time six days a week.The question was raised of the difficulties which arose in firms where the workers were interchangeable between different types of work, and were consequently at present within the scope of several Boards, in particular the Rope, Twine and Net, the Jute, and the Flax and Hemp Trade Boards, in addition to the Made-up Textiles Trade Board. It was agreed that the chairman should bring the question to the Ministers notice.Ready-Made and Wholesale Bespoke Tailoring Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board unanimously agreed in view of the attempts now being made to bring about the abolition of Trade Boards, to place on record their opinion that the establishment of a Board has been of considerable advantage to the ready-made and wholesale bespoke section of the tailoring trade, notwithstanding certain administrative defects towards the removal of which steps were now being taken.The Board considered a letter from the Minister referring back for further consideration the minimum rates fixed by the Board at their last meeting, and agreed to ask that the Minister should receive a deputation from the Board at the earliest moment practicable. The Board adopted the recommendation of the Administrative Committee, that a measure cutter, as defined in Section I of Part III of the Schedule to the Ministers Order, dated 6th August, 1920, should Be capable of cutting coats, vests and trousers, but need not necessarily be employed on all three garments.Canal Boatmen (Midlands). The Industrial Court heard an application from the employers&apos; side of the Midland Wages Board for a reduction of 20 per cent, on earnings.Evidence was submitted that the average weekly earnings during the four weeks ending the 1st October, 1920, were  5 2s. 3d., excluding &quot; waiting time,&quot; the corresponding pre-war wages being 35s. Traffic had so diminished that a number of workers had been discharged, and the rest were employed, on the average, only three-quarter time. The employers urged that freight rates must be cut to meet railway competition. It was submitted on behalf of the men that the rates paid were reasonable, and that the reduction would effect no appreciable saving on the cost of the goods carried.The Court expressed the view that &quot; the state of trade affords, among other con-siderations, a proper basis upon which claims for changes in rates of wages can be decided.&quot; They noted that when the last advance of 8s. Gd. per week was granted, in May, 1920, &quot; the industrial position and outlook were very favourable, and such as to make possible the payment of rates of wages which are not necessarily appropriate at the present time.&quot; They accordingly decided that those additions to the rates of the men concerned which were made as from the 24th May, 1920, should be withdrawn.   (Award No. 641.)[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Industrial Relations will be found also on pages 394 to 399, 403 and 404.]
General Department-continued.Tin Box Trade Board (Great Britain). After consideration of a letter sent from the Ministry to Messrs. Paton, Calvert &amp; Co., the Administrative Committee agreed to inform the Ministry that they are of opinion that the manufacture of tin tops of composite boxes, wherever carried out, is within the scope of the Board, and that if, after reconsideration, the Minister adheres to the contrary view, the scope of the Board should be amended.Wholesale Mantle and Costume Trade Board (Great Britain)-The Board considered a letter from the Ministry referring hack for further consideration the minimum rates of wages for male and female workers as carried by the Board at their previous meeting, and agreed to appoint a deputation to wait upon the Minister to discuss the matter. It was agreed to ask the Ministry to furnish to the secretary, in addition to replies sent by the Ministry on questions of scope, copies of the questions raised, and, further, to inquire when it is proposed to give effect to the recommendations of the Committee on Trade Boards Administration with regard to such questions.FIXING AND VARIATION OF MINIMUM RATES OF WAGES.Aerated Waters Trade Board (Ireland).-T\\e Board have issued a Notice of Proposal, dated the 27th April, to vary general minimum time-rates and overtime rates for male and female workers.The general minimum time-rate proposed for male workers, 21 years of age and over, is Is. 2d. per hour, and for female workers, 18 years of age and over, 7M. per hour. Lower rates are proposed in each case for younger workers. Overtime rates are to be calculated on the proposed general minimum time-rates in the same manner as the overtime rates at present in operation.Brush and Broom Trade Board (Great Britain). The Minister has made an Order dated the 20th April, confirming general minimum rates of wages, as fixed or varied, for certain classes of male and female workers, and has specified the 27th April as the date from which these rates are effective.Milk Distributive Trade Board (Scotland).-- he Board have issued a Notice of Proposal dated the 20th April, to fix general minimum time-rates and overtime rates for male and female workers.The general minimum time-rates proposed for foremen is 78s. Gd. per week, and for male shop assistants and male clerks, 21 years of age and over, 62s. Gd.; for all male workers other than foremen, male shop assistants and clerks, and for roundswomen, 57s. Gd. for those with less than 12 months&apos; experience in the trade, and 60s. for others ; for female clerks, 39s.; for female shop&apos; assistants, 35s.; for all other femalo workers, 32s. Gd. Lower rates, are proposed in each case for younger workers.Overtime rates are proposed for all workers, and in this connection the Board propose to declare the normal number of hours of work to be 48 in any week and 4 on Sundays and customary public and statutory holidays.Retail Bespoke Tailoring Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board have issued a Notice of Proposal, dated the 25th April, to fix or vary general minimum time-rates, overtime rates and piece-work basis time-rates for female learners and apprentices, male learners, and certain other classes of male workers.The proposed general minimum time-rate for all male workers, excluding cutters and trimmers, workers specified in Part I of the Trade Board&apos;s notice dated the 4th June, 1920, certain classes of apprentices, and learners, is Is. 2d. per hour.With regard to the overtime rates, the Board propose that the same method of calculation as that at present in operation should be adopted, taking as the basis the general minimum time-rates now proposed.Hat, Cap and Millinery Trade Board (Iretand).-The Board have issued a Notice of Proposal, dated the 18th April, to fix general minimum time-rates and overtime rates for female learners.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Trade Boards will also be found page 397.]

The effects of the dispute in the coal industry are becoming apparent. Unemployment is increasing rapidly in most districts, as the result of further restrictions in working hours or suspensions of work.Metis Employment.Iron and Steel. In Scotland, Messrs. J. Dunlop &amp; Co., Ltd., Airdrie, employing 870 men, have closed down, and the Scottish Iron &amp; Steel Co., Ltd., employing 420 men, are on the point of suspending operations. At Rutherglen, Messrs. Stewarts &amp; Lloyds, Ltd., tube manufacturers, employing from 600 to 800 workers, have also closed down. In the Northern Division, where the unemployment figures have increased by 10,378 males and 2,071 females during the week, 3,000 men have been suspended indefinitely by Sir W. G. Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co?, Elswick.In the Wearside area practically all firms are dependent on electric power, which is now strictly rationed.  A large number of workers have been placed on short time.At Workington the services of some 300 to 400 men, who have been cleaning up at the local steel works, have now been dispensed with. The wire rope trade in the Willington Quay area is stated to be busy and working full time.Sheffield report further suspensions of 800 men by Messrs. Cammell, Laird &amp; Co., Ltd,, and 500 by Messrs. had fields, Ltd. At Bradford, over 2,000 workpeople have been sus-pended from engineering works, and at Derby the Midland Railway Co. have decided to close down their forge department.In the West Midlands Division, the shortage of coal is having a marked effect on firms in the Birmingham district, but so far there have been very few heavy discharges of labour from any one firm.Messrs. Gimson &amp; Co., Ltd., Leicester, engineers, are closing down their foundry, machine and filling shops, which will affect approximately 500 workpeople. At Luton the Skefko Ball Bearing Co., Ltd., employing about 1,000 workpeople, are also closing down. In Wales, the Mond Nickel Works, Clydach, employing 650 workpeople, are closing, but on the other hand, at Newport, the Ebbw Vale steel sleeper plant restarted work during the week.[ Shipbuilding and Allied Industries. On the Clyde the lull in shipbuilding is becoming more pronounced, and at Clydebank employment at the works of Messrs. John Brown &amp; Co. Ltd., is restricted to half staff on alternate weeks. The Dundee Shipbuilding Co., who normally employ 350 workers, have closed down entirely. On the Tyne, Tees, and Wear, employment in the shipyards continues to be fairly satisfactory, but, at Jarrow,, Messrs. Palmer&apos;s Shipbuilding &amp; Iron Co., Ltd., have paid off the night shift of 350 men in their shipyard and engine shops. On the Humber the Goole Shipbuilding and Repairing Co. are discharging 600 workers owing to cancellation of contracts. A few firms on the Mersey are busy re-conditioning steamers which are forced to lay up ; otherwise the trade&apos; is decidedly quiet.
Employment and Insurance Department-continued., In South Wales more work was available at the yards at Swansea during the week, but at Newport only one firm are doing work to any considerable extent.Textiles and Clothing. Business in the cotton trade continues to increase, and it is reported that only the shortage of fuel prevents marked progress in this industry. At Bacup, Blackburn, Chorley, Glossop, and Todmorden, a number of mills with orders on hand have been compelled to close down entirely owing to shortage of fuel.      I -  .In the woollen textile trade, two firms at Wakefield, employing about 500 workpeople, have closed down, and firms in the Dewsbury district are contemplating further reductions in working hours, or closing clown entirely.An improvement in the flax trade is reported from Brechin, but at least one linen factory in the Dunfermline area is expected to close down, pending a settlement of the coal dispute. At Paisley, the Ferguslie Mills of Messrs. J. &amp; P. Coats, and the Anchor Mills of Messrs. Clark &amp; Co., employing between 8,000 and 9,000 workpeople, have been placed on short time.The boot and shoe trade in th. Northampton district has improved, despite the cancellation or postponement of orders owing to the coal stoppage, and it is expected that the improvement will continue until Whitsuntide. A firm of elastic web manufacturers , at Loughborough have closed down indefinitely.Transport. At Leith, supplies of bunker coal for shipping are very low, and unemploy-ment among seamen is increasing. Fairly large cargo ships continue to arrive and employ-ment for dockers is steady. At Hull, transport work is exceedingly dull, and there is a surplus of 4,000 workers at the docks. On the Thames, work both at Tilbury and at the Surrey Commercial Docks is very slack, but some improvement is looked for when the new wood season commences. At South Wales ports general cargo work is considerably less than last week, and at Swansea practically all coal trimmers are idle. Work at Liverpool docks is of a very insignificant nature, there are 7,000 more dock labourers on the unemployed list than at the end of February.Miscellaneous Trades. Unemployment in the pottery trade is becoming acute owing to a shortage of fuel. Messrs. W. T. Copelands &amp; Sons, employing 900 workers, have now closed down, and the various departments of all factories are expected to cease work during the week. Glass works at Barnsley and Castleford are reported to be rapidly exhausting their coal stocks, and at St. Helens 410 glass workers have been discharged by Messrs. Pilkington Bros., Ltd., and Messrs. Nuttall &amp; Co., Ltd.In the fishing trade a trade dispute is holding up the Tyne fleet; more trawlers have put to sea from Grimsby, but; the coal supplied is so poor that great difficulty is experienced in keeping the engines going. The spring fishing season at Lowestoft has been entirely suspended, and the whole fishing fleet is laid up. At Wick the preparation of the trawling fleet for sea is held in abeyance pending a settlement of the coal question.In the Gravesend district 300 workpeople have been discharged owing to the closing down of the, Northfleet Paper Mills. Local cement firms are reducing staffs still further, owing to the depression in the export trade.In the Metropolitan area the coal stoppage has not yet materially affected the industrial position in most districts, but at Canning Town 3,000 workers are affected by the closing of a rubber works.Women&apos;s Employment.Local Reports. The improvement in the outlook of the cotton industry appears to have been very definite during the last week or two. Other workers in the North-Western Division remain affected by the general depression, as in the case of hatters at Denton, paper workers at Barrow, Darwen and New Mills, metal workers at Tyldesley and glass workers at St. Helens.The coal stoppage is seriously intensifying the depression in the textile industry in the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division, and is making itself increasingly felt in other industries, such as pottery, glass, rubber, wire, and chemicals. At Sheffield slackness is increasing in the silver trade, and the boot and shoe industry remains depressed. ^ Some improvement is noted among workers in flax, and women have been placed during the week at Goole and Selby.There have been some slight improvements in the clothing industry in the South Midlands and Eastern Division, but general improvement is retarded by fuel scarcity. At Colchester it is reported that, if the strike is protracted, all clothing machining firms will close down. At Braintree the silk trade is very slack, and at Norwich many crepe
Employment and Insurance Department-continued.weavers are likely to be suspended. Food preserving workers with 15 or 20 years&apos; service have been discharged at Lowestoft.The important staple industries in the West Midlands Division are seriously affected by the coal dispute. Birmingham report that unemployment and short-time are on the increase. Metal machinists have been thrown out of work at Smethwick, Sparkhill and Aston.  At Leek the silk industry continues depressed.The depression in the clothing trades of the South-Western Division is accentuated by the reduction of coal and power supplies. In Wales short time is increasing in the tinplate works and at Swansea 300 women workers are out of employment.Many factories in the Northern Division are closed down owing to the stoppage. There have been many discharges of paper workers at Gateshead-on-Tyne, Sunderland and West Hartlepool. The co-operative society at Middlesbrough are placing their staff on short time ; 700 women are affected.All industries in Scotland are affected. Many factories are working on short time, and others have suspended their workers indefinitely. The woollen industry is much affected, and unemployment amongst the women workers at Galashiels and Stirling is severe. Textile workers are affected notably at Alloa, Dumbarton and Paisley. Short time continues in the linen industry at Dunfermline, and in Edinburgh the principal works in the rubber industry have put their whole staff, including 1,700 women, on short time.In Ireland many textile factories which closed down at Easter have not yet re-opened ; other firms who are working short time have reduced the number employed. Many flax workers affected by the depressed state of the linen trade have been compelled to seek other employment. In addition to the universal depression in trade, northern factories and warehouses have to contend with the economic boycott of Belfast goods in the South and West of Ireland.LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Unemployment Insurance. Committees continue to criticise the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1921, particularly with regard to the 20 weeks&apos; employment qualification. The Richmond Committee are of opinion that all persons who, being normally in an insured trade, temporarily accepted alternative employment in an uninsured occupation, and thus are unable to qualify for benefit under Section 3, should be allowed to count that occupation as employment in an insured trade.Training. Both the East Ham and Ilford Committees deplore the disbanding of the Essex Industrial Training ^Council. The East Ham Committee urge the Minister to consider the training of children who have lost their fathers in the war, as allowances cease at the age of 16, and in the committee^ opinion the pensions of the widows are inadequate for the purpose.JUVENILE BRANCH.Juvenile Employment (North-Western Division). The Divisional Controller notes it as remarkable that in the textile areas a considerable number of juveniles are making claims to unemployment benefit, through associations, while in other areas indirect claims by juveniles are uncommon. There appears little evidence to support the opinion of some committees that the payment of unemployment benefit to juveniles is having an adverse effect on their characters, while there is general agreement among juvenile officers that the money is generally a welcome addition to the hard-pressed family exchequer. Boys and girls are, as a whole, extremely anxious to obtain employment, even at reduced wages, and where there are signs of deterioration it is rather the result of compulsory idleness than of the mis-spending of unemployment benefit.Only two approved centres for unemployed juveniles have been opened in the division.. The need for these centres is only too apparent and Juvenile Employment Committees have repeatedly urged their establishment, but in most cases local education authorities have been found unwilling to take action on the ground of expense.Though formal co-operation with secondary schools is not far advanced, in a period of three months over 600 boys and girls from secondary schools applied for advice or assistance to Juvenile Employment Committees, and 250 were placed in employment.[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment and Insurance Department will also be found on pages 394 to 396, 403 and 409.]
APPOINTMENTS AND TRAINING.APPOINTMENTS  AND  CIVIL LIABILITIES DEPARTMENT.APPOINTMENTS.Statistics. During the week ending the 22nd April the department placed 347 candidates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 53,900. Of these 7,113 have been placed through the agency of the departments Interviewing Boards. Applications were registered from 649 ex-Service men and 39 civilians. The number of candidates available for appointments on the 22nd April was 11,175 ex-Service men and 1,254 civilians. At the same date, 883 live vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 396 having been registered during the week.BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.Maintenance and Training Grants Scheme. During the month ending the 22nd April, the department received applications for training under this scheme from 70 officers or men of similar educational qualifications, of which 50 were for training of the type provided by the department. Deducting cancellations and withdrawals, 28,148 applications for training of this latter type have been received in all, and 49,473 for training of the type provided by other Government departments. The Interviewing Boards have dealt with 27,884 applications, of which 23,309 have been recommended. The Grants Committee, dealing with applications so recommended have received 22,240 applications and sanctioned grants in 18,424 cases.Business Training Scheme. During the week ending the 22nd April, the department received 49 applications for training under this scheme, bringing the total number of applications to 3,188, of which 1,514 have since been cancelled. Grants have been sanctioned in 705 cases. At the same date 330 vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 25 having been registered during the week.Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The department have dealt with a total of 1,185 cases, in 514 of which the training sanctioned is provided by the Appointments Department, and in the remainder by other Government departments. Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed training in 320 cases, and abandoned training in 45 ; 115 are still in training, and 33 are awaiting training.TRAINING DEPARTMENT. INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men.Statistics. On the 26th April, 24,422 men were in training, as against 24,352 on the 19th April, and 24,477 on the 29th March. During the week, 522 men were placed in training. There were 16,575 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 19th April and the 29th March being 16,847 and 16,428. The number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 30,566, the totals for the 19th April and the 29th March being 30,114 and 28,953.The small rise in the total number of men in training, and a large proportion of the increase in the number of weekly placings in training, are due to the fact that the figures for the Springfield Training College, which was recently opened with an entry of nearly 150 students, are now for the first time included.Institutional Training. The Devon and Cornwall Division are now the only division with no definite factory facilities of their own, the factory at Bristol, in the adjoining South-Western Division, being available for men in these two counties. In six divisions out of the seventeen over 75 per cent, of all institutional training is now given under Govern-ment Instructional Factory conditions, the proportions ranging from 78 per cent, in the South Midlands to 99 per cent, in Middlesex.Exhibitions.-^?, departments stand at the Building Trades Exhibition was productive of distinctly good results. Full advantage was taken of the opportunity of removing misapprehension with regard to the work of the department in connection with the building trades, and the thoroughness of the organisation of the training scheme as applied to the
Appointments and Training-continued.various main branches of the trade was amply demonstrated. No fewer than 135 firms have asked for further information, while an equal number have, as a result of their own inquiries and inspection, taken with them a note of the name of an officer of the department with a view to future correspondence. A large proportion of inquiries came from firms in the provinces, and, on the whole, though there is no lack of sympathy in London, the chance of platings outside the London area seems more promising than within the London district itself.Government Instructional Factories. During the past week there has again been a slight decrease in the number of men in training ; the total &quot;now stands at 10,773.The small engineering factory at Rochdale are undertaking a considerable amount of repair work for two large garages in the district, and the various jobs are stated to provide excellent training opportunities for the men.The haircutting of the personnel of the Walker detachment of the Royal Defence Force is being undertaken by members of the hairdressing class at the Factory, who thus obtain some very useful individual practice.Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics. Up to the 27th April agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 46,227 apprentices, under the 41 schemes approved. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 44,103 apprentices, employed by 17,531 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on expiration of the appropriate period of training or by mutual agree-ment between the parties is now 23,587.Wages. Local headquarters for the South-Western area report that, in several cases which have recently been investigated, the apprentice has agreed to accept a nominal sum from 10s. per week, as the employer&apos;s share of the wages. Such instances have been found in industries where no trade union was in existence and also in non-federated firms. The employer invariably pleads that he has paid the correct rate, and states that the apprenticed signature on the claim form is evidence of the fact. In one instance, a firm, who had been basing their claim on a prescribed rate of 92s., were paying apprentices no more than 15s. a week as their share of the wages.Suspension of Agreements. Apprentices under the scheme called up for service in connection with the present industrial crisis will be allowed to make up later the time so lost.An apprentice of the North-Eastern Marine Engineering Co., Ltd., Wallsend-on-Tyne, has for 18 months been unable to follow his apprenticeship owing to a recurrence of his Army disability. After several months&apos; hospital treatment he was allowed to take up lighter employment, reporting from time to time to his medical officer, and now that lie is able to do the heavier work of his trade, an application has been made for an extended period of training under the scheme to cover the time so lost.General Training.Apprenticeship: Building. Successful joint conferences between employers and operatives have taken place at Wolverhampton and at Scarborough. At both meetings a resolution was passed recommending the national scheme to the various organisations represented, for favourable consideration.At Southend, action in getting the scheme known was in the first place taken by the Juvenile Advisory Committee. On the 14th April, the scheme was explained to the master builders at their annual general meeting, with the object of further preparing the ground, and in this way to assist the committee to accomplish what they have set out to do. A full meeting of the Juvenile Advisory Committee will be held on the 3rd May to deal with the subject; delegates of the master builders&apos; association and of the United Building Trades Committee (Operatives) will attend.There is difficulty in arranging a fully representative meeting of employers in the East Grinstead district owing to the wide area covered by the association; the treasurer has therefore suggested that the scheme be explained and discussed at their next meeting, and has asked for copies of the scheme.In South Wales, the position is not so satisfactory as elsewhere. The operatives desire the matter to be dealt with on an area, basis, and the employers feel that it is useless to proceed with the matter for the moment.[Reference, to matters of interest to the Appointments and Training Departments will also be found on page 407.]
