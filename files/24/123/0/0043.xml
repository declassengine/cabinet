How soon an overture wan be expected l1r would be unwise to predict.   Mr. Cramp said yesterday that the strike would be over in a fortnight.It is said that if wages on a sliding scale, based on the cost of living, were offered and a ballot taken, the men would go back.Dockers in various parts of the country have refused to handle sea-borne coal.   The Transport Yforkers&apos; Executive is trying to persuade the railwaymen and locomotive drivers to join in a national embargo.   The meeting will take place to-morrow, but it is clear that Mv. Cramp intends to keep the railwayman out of the dispute if he can.   It is significant that the railwaymen who were suspended in 3oot,land for refusing to carry coal have voluntarily gone back to work to-day.   In Glasgow the dockers, sailors and firemen are on strike, and are supported by the extremist railwayman, but coal is being handled nevertheless.The Coinraunist Part? and worker^ Committees are working feverishly to bring about a strike at 10 p..iw on Sunday next.     1 It is believed that unless there is official sanction not fifteen per cent of the members will respond.Much of the present unrest is due to the activity of the Communist Party.   The arrest of Albert Inkpin and Robert Stewart and the search of the headquarters have, however, somewhat checked its activity fbr the moment.Summonses/
- z -Summonses have been eerved on the National labour  ress in respect of the printing and publishing of &quot;The Theses of the Communist International&quot;. Action is also being taken against the H&amp;tional labour ?re3S in Manchester for printing the leaflet &quot;A Call to Action&quot; for the Workers1 Committee Movement.   60.000 copies were printed on April 28th and 80,000 on May 9th.On the vfoole, though the air in charges with electricity, there io reason to believe that the atmosphere will have cleared very much *hen my next Weekly Bepert has to be witten, here is much public curiosity about the share which foreign money has had in the present atri)c*t   It is undoubtedly true that money from abroad haa been freely expended by Ootomunlat agitators In the various districts on salaries, travelling expenses ana the printing of laallets to provofce addition in the Army and Havy, such a&amp; the specimen attached to this report.Thore id good ground for hoping that the supply of aoney from America to Sinn Jfein may be dried up and that the responsible Irish-Americans vdll exert their influence on the Side of peace.
MB COAX CRISISOutmrtUy &quot;there,^has been little change in the attitude of the miners, as expressed in resolutions: individually, however, a very large number of miners say that they would welcome a return to work while many say that they do not care about the National Pool as long as they are sure of reasonable wages.     It is probable that a wages offer on a sliding scale, based upon the cost of living, would stand a good chance of acceptance.The Transport Workers broke up late yesterday afternoon to meet again to-raorrow at Unity House with the Executive of the National Union of Uailwaymen when they think an important decision will be taken.As a whole the miners remain very orderly:   there have been disorders, particularly&apos;in Lancashire, arising from the working of outcrops and the transport of coal and in South Wales cases of intimidation have occurred and there have been disturbances in Scotland.    The demonstrations against outcrop workers in Lancashire have been large;   on May 8th between 10,000 and 12,000 miners assembled at Gladehill where over 3,000.men were working.    Councillor Tinker led the demonstrators, and peaceful persuasion was successful in most oases:   one man, however, was thrown down a pit.    Owing to interference by the miners, the transport cf coal by road has been carried out under police protection. The Hindley, West Loughton and Atherton miners have arranged, in conjunction with labour leaders and the co-operative   -societies for the collection and free distribution of ooal among the poor of&quot;Manchester and district.In Yorkshire the working of outcrops has caused, muoh ill-feeling and on. May 10th, about 300 miners barricaded the road at Woodhouse Mill near Sheffield and emptied a number of lorries which were conveying coal from KlvetonPark/
Perk Colliery to Sheffield for boiler firing.   The lorries were subsequently re-loaded under police protection and completed their journey.On May 5th about 300 miners from V/allsend-on-Tyne took temporary possession of part of the headquarters of the Northumberland Miners&apos; Association cs a protest against a special meeting of the Council wjiioh bad been arranged for the following day.The disturbances in the Tfnyshir district have been directed against oertain officials employed on safety work at the United national Company&apos;s pit.   The South Wales Colliery Examiners1 Association has passed resolutions strongly protesting against the intimidation of their members.In--Scotland there have been disturbances in Stirlingshire, where the police made a baton charge on May 4th end in the Lothians.Dockers at various ports have refused to handle sea V&apos; . borne coal:   in Glasgow they are on strike, as are local members of the National Seamen&apos;s end riremen&apos;s Union; the railwaymen have refused to handle coal and eight employees of the Caledonian Hallway Company have been dismissed in consequence.The Scottish Dockers&apos; Executive is urging the National Transport Federation to call a general strike, but it is unlikely that such a step will be taken.   -Efforts,to tighten the embargo, in conjunction with the railwaymen and the International Transport Federation isi? more probable.Practically all industry is grievously affected by the strike and unemployment is increasing rapidly.TB3L .5LE0TRICAL TRADES UHIOfl-The Secretary of the Wandsworth Branch.of the electrical trades/
Trades Union wrote some days ago to a member who had enlisted in the Defence Force, saying that in default of a satisfactory explanation of his conduct in joining the Porces he would be expelled.   This man showed the letter to his Coiamandlng Officer.   A few days later he received another letter, saying that as he hed not replied he had been expelled.   Yesterday a Police Officer called at Newingtoo&apos;s house and asked for the book in which copies of letters were reoordod.   ThiB was handed over with a little demur and it proved to contain oopiee of the above mentioned letters, together with similar correspondence v/ith another member of the Defence Porce who had been expelled.    Newington apoears to have acted without directions from the head office.   The question of prosecuting him is new being considered and it is possible that if a nrosecution is undertaken there may be an electriciansT strike. If this ocours there ought to be no difficulty in carrying on essential services.TBE C0I1MUNISTSThroughout the last few weeks Communism has been rapidlygaining ground.   It has been difficult to trace the movements of travelling agitators, for they are how speaking underassumed names.   Matters were becoming so serious and the issueof literature containing incitements to violence was so great that it was decided to proceed against the publisher andprinter of documents issued by the Communist Party containingtextual quotations from the propagandist journals of theThird International in Moscow.   Albert Inkpin, tho secretaryof the Communist Party, was arrested on the 7th May and theCornmunist Office at 16, JCing Street, was searched.   Documentsthat filled a motor lorry and two taxioabs were removed andare now under examination.   It is too early yet to make a detailed report upon the seizures, but the benkihg accountbshow that the Party has been living upon monies far in   &apos;excess/
excess of anything that it could have reoeived by subscriptions I in this oountry.   ISndeavours are now being made through the laborious process of tracing bank notes to d termine the sou roe of this revenue.Among the papers seized are letters from two Japanese Communists, in one of which the writer states that he is prepared for any servioe ordered by the Communist Party of Great Britain, end from certain Indians.   In view of the presence of the   Crown prince of Japan in this oountry the Japanese are beta interviewed this afternoon and a recommendation will be made to the Rome Secretary for their deportation unless they are prepare! to leave the country forthwith.Disturbances at Aldorshot 1On Friday last there was a demonstration by soldiers belonging to the Royal Artillery, The Royal Engineers and the. - v; army Servioe Corps, in the High Street, Aldershot, at the junotion of Station Road and Gun Rill, immediately in front of j the Artillery Guard Room.   Two street lamps and three windows we) broken and a rush was made at a motor car.   A number of men then went to the Artillery Guard Room and smashed the windows.   Picketj were posted on Saturday evening and there were no signs of disorder until 10.15 p. a., when a large body of soldiers with a few sailors assembled at the junction of Wellington Street and I High Street, opposite the Royal Hotel and the Police Station.   I few minutes later some of the men displayed a Red flag, which is since said to have been put into their hands by oivili an s, and  I shonts of &quot;Come on the RebelsI&quot; were heard.   The windows of a passing &quot;bus were then struok and the men, who now numbered abou 1,000 became unmanageable.   They began to break the windows of tl Royal Hotel and ran through Wellington Street and Victoria Road smashing windows as they went.   The naval picket could do 1nothing against them, and when this was reinforced the damage 1 had been done and the ringleaders had disappeared.   About fifty jwindows/
windows, large and small, were broken, and there was some looting of boots, drapery and cheap Jewellery.   The damage is estimated at between  1,500 and  2,000.   Two gunners were arrested with stolen boots in their possession and handed over to the Military Authorities.   There is reason for believing that civilians were among the soldiers, inciting them to dis-order, but there is nothing to show that there was any active spirit of mutiny among the men.   They are discontented at being kept with the Colours when apparently there is nothing for them to do, and some of them had undoubtedly been drinking.There was a critical moment during the disturbance when the situation was saved by the Officer in Command of the Cavalry Corps.On May 6th there was.a disturbance at doncaster among the men of the Machine Oun Corps, when a Company Sergeant Major was dangerously hurt and it became necessary to call in the Civil Police.   Several of the men have since been reported absent. It is thought that they may have been at the bottom of the disturbance.The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; Is taking rather a sinister interest in unrest in the Army&apos;and N;avy.   Hellor is having soecial enquiries made and is in telephonic communication with his investigators.the; lqnpqk district council oy, ths commukist partyThe London and Rome Counties District Council of the Communist Party, of which  . ft. Cent is the organiser, has Issued the first edition of the &quot;Monthly Record&quot;.   Tne object of this publication is to &quot;keep the rank and file of the London movement informed as to what is being done and what needs to be done (1) by the District Counoil and X ) by&quot;&quot;its constituent branches.&quot; The London Committee will use the International Socialist Club as headquarters.   The following extracts taken from an article * entitled &quot;Industrial Organisation&quot; by A. H, Hawkins, indicate the efforts which the Communist Party is making to permeate the trade union movement: &quot;nn-/
&quot;One of tho immediate tasks which confronts the Communist Party ig the transformation of the many working olass and semi-working clacs organisations which exist in this country into instruments of revolution.   The first group to he tackled are the trade unions ....&quot;The exact scope of the task before ub is laid down very clearly in the Statutes and Theses of the Second Congress of the Tuird International.   3rieflyt it is the preparation for the ineviteble&apos; period of working class dictatorship by the formation of Communist nuolei or groups in every organisation of the workers, commencing with the industrial field arid passing on through the co-operatives, the political groups and parties of the working masses, the clubs and athletic associations.&quot;We can, however, narrow down the work immediately before us to this * the concentration of the nnergiea of every branch upon the formation of a Communist group in every Trade Union branch within its area...4&quot;Having formed these groups in every Trade Union branch it will next be nvwssary to use them to the fullest possible advantage.   rfhis will be done in two ways.(l)   &quot;Skcn Branch will have an industrial committee whose duty it will be to co-ordinate the activities of the groups in the Trade Union branches in their area to secure the domination of the local Trades Councils by Communists througji the&apos;selection of Communists delegates by each branch.   Tho Industrial Committee will also stimulate the propaganda of the Red Trade Union International in their own area.(2)   &quot;As soon as possible sectional conferences of all party msukers in a given union or industry will be called at which the taotios to be pursued by the Commimiat Aroups in that union will be discussed in conjunction with the London District Council... Every official position must be captured, every shop stewards position, every Trades Council position must be held by a Communist.&quot;It is interesting to note that the type of the &quot;Record&quot; is very similar to that of the seditious leaflet &quot;To the Soddiers&quot;.   The imprint is &quot;The Enterprise Press&apos;&apos;, but efforts to locate it have been unsuccessful.The foil wing report dated Hay 3rd, from the Lancashire organiser of the Communist Party, indicates the progress ftade by the party In this area:
. &quot;With respect to the position in Lancashire there is an increasing call for propagandists whioh it has taken me all my time to cope with.   I have heen successful in fixing up the outdoor propaganda for practically the whole of tho branches in the area, with the exception of the new branches recently come into the Party.   I have fixed upwards of 300 meetings from my speakers list in addition to special propaganda meetings for Comrades J. V/ilson, Vin Williams and others.   The new I,L,P, Left Wing branches which have come over are now clamouring for speakers, and I shall get down to the matter immediately.   The special work with respect to the Strike edition of the &quot;Communist&quot; and the securing of means of transport in the event of a general strike, and on the top of that the work of making arrangements for the Conference, interfered with the course Ol  enersl work of the Division, but I ftave been able to keep in touch with the groups of secessionists along with Comrade Wilson&apos; and as a consequence th? Levenshulme and Moss Side I.L.P, Left Wingers have fused their forces at a meeting held last Friday when I was present and formed the S. Manchester branch of the Communist Party.   I attended a meeting at Stalybridge 2 weeks a^o and reformed the branch there. The secretary, J. Carney, sent in an application to be represented at tho Conference,   I have visited Stockport twice recently, but there does not seem any immediate chance of a branch at present.   I have promised to fix up a few outdoor meetings for the group of Comrades there with a view to getting in touch with prospective members, and shall make another attempt at forming a Branch in Stockport later,   I am to attend a meeting on -Friday of this week at Altriucham, where there is a Left Wing Group of about 14 determined to form a branch. Also I have fixed up a meeting at Gorton, where things have been hanging fire for some time, and shall attempt to get them launched on Tuesday of next week.   There is also a meeting arranged by myself on Wednesday of next week at Urmston .where there is a dozen comrades anxious to get into harness.   Comrade J, V/ilson and I had a good talk over matters yesterday, and I arranged for him to., visit the Coins, Wei son, Burnley district en Thursday, Friday and Saturday of this week, and fixed/ttj to address a meeting in Acorington on Sunday evening for the Discussion Class there, where they are very anxious to have the case put for Communism.   There is an average attendance of 450 people, and the newly formed branch of the party at Acorington is very eager for this meeting. There is a great possibility in this area and we. intend to concentrate on it.   On his return next week I shall fix upon series of propaganda meetings in that area. Comrade Wilson wants me to - fix him up for a series of meetings in and around the Manchester District next week, which I shall do as there are great openings here. Comrade Vin Williams has also written to me asking me to fix him up for a few meetings in the Railway and Mining districts.irI sent along to Comrade Inkpin a scheme for the organisation of a Communist Cycling Corps for use in time of emergency.   I thought it would be a good plan to have such a scheme on a National Basis, but have not received any word as to whether it will be acceptable.   Such an organisation would be absolutely invaluable in times of National Crises, and all the panicky arrangements which we had to resort to a week or two ago would be obviated.&quot;There/
&quot;There are about 12 new propagandists to come out of the Left Wing Groups, whom I have approached with a view to their inclusion in my speakers list.   They would relieve the situation created by an increasing demand for speakers,&quot;In Birmingham, Brain, the Red Trade Union International organiser, Shepperson and Trott are particularly active in the Communist interest, but, owing&apos; to the activity of the local police, are making little headway.   It is significant &apos; that Shepperson had in his possession when recently arrested a Co-operative Bank Pass Book showing that he had banked  250 since May 1st, 1920,   During this period he has had-no v/ork but has spent his time addressing meetings in the Bull Ring and at street corners.The solicitors of the Independent Labour Party have made a formal demand for the keys of the premises recently seiaed by the Communist Party at Coventry.   The Communists, on their side, have formed an &quot;Ejectment Committee&quot;, which mounts guard in relief when the premises are open, in order to keep out members of the Independent Labour Party.   My correspondent thinks that the movement in this town requires eareful attention, as it is growing rapidly.   Communist officials are now paid regular salaries and devote all their time to their work.   The steadier trade unionists, while expressing great satisfaction at the arrest of Leonard Jackson, think that the example of the Birmingham police in dealing with their local agitators, should be followed in other Midland towns.   From repeatedly expressed opinions, there is no doubt that an overwhelming majority would welcome a strengthening of the law in regard to Communist propaganda.   It is thought that if the movement were driven underground, it would be less pernicious as many of the present adherents to the party would not trouble, or would be afraid, to adopt hole and corner methods.The/
m    Q   MThe Communist movement is gaining ground in Yorkshire although there is a fierce quarrel between the Communist Party, Independent Labour Party and Socialist Labour Party.   Sean McLoughlin is speaking in this area on behalf of the last named body and has violently denounced &quot;the tinpot*revolutionaries of the Communist Party who already see themselves leading Red Divisions - from behind.&quot;The seoretary of the Castleford branch of the party reports to headquarters that 26 meetings have been held by his branch during the month.newIt is reported that the Communists are establishing/branches in various districts of Glasgow:   the progress made is due to the fact that the movement is subsidised and not dependent on money collected locally.   Tom Clark and three other organisers are each receiving a salary of  6 a week from headquarters and it is probable that several additional officials are also paid.   Steele, who was recently imprisoned in Birmingham,has been recounting his experiences in the Glasgow area.   On May -8th about 2,000 people attended a &quot;free Speech&quot; demonstration: the speakers Included John McLean, &quot;Sandy&quot; Ross, Mart on and MoGovero.  McLean asserted that the murder of Inspector Johnstons, was deliberately planned to give the police a chance to provoke riots.   Be made other extravagant accusations against the Government.   A resolution was passed protesting against &quot;the action of the Government in arresting individuals for using the right of free speeoh and their prolonged detention in prison awaiting trial&quot;, and demanding their release, the immediate withdrawal of troops from Ireland, the disbandment of the Defence Force and the recognition of the principles of free speech.The work of the party has been greatly disorganised by the arrest of Robert Stowart, the national organiser, and Tom Clark; the Scottish organiser, writes:
&quot;I am still in London and if things goes on %[ way they are going 1 may have to remain in England some time either in Prison or at the Office.&quot;You will have seen by the papers that the offj has boon raided and Inkpin has been arrested.   Last night Bob otowart was taken to Scotland Yard.&quot;I am just going to the Office and don&apos;t know Jthings are, they may be waiting for us all.   But sobJone must carry on.   And I think the Clyde Boys will the last to funk.&quot;The wives and dependents of imprisoned Communists arf receiving weekly payments from headquarters.THE HAILWAYICSM, AND TRAg3P0RT.^0RKBP.SThe Executive of the &quot;Railwayraen and Transport Workers] are meeting to-morrow at U:;ity House.In conversation yesterday, not intended for publicatiol Mr, Cramp said that whereas formerly he was ih favour of a Soviet form of Government, which he believed to be the most] enlightened form, he had now had reason to change his opinions. ;Be is no longer a Communist and he is very much against a general strike as he believes that the,only result! would be general rioting.   He said that if a general strike were called, the railwaymen would take it up in a very half-hearted way.   He did not regard the Aldershot riot seriously and said that if the soldiers and sailors were gif more work to do such disturbances would not occur.   The railwaymen feel that as the transport workers have refused to load up coal, the railwaymen will be represented as lettii down both tho miners and the transport workers if they carry it.   The most important point in the interview was Mr. Cramp1 e intention.   At the moment he said that he means to play for time in the hope that something or other; may turn up, and that the coal strike will be ovor in a fortnight. As to the Communist Party, he paid no attention to., it,because it had no real hold, but he thought it essential that its.   , 1 propaganda/
propaganda /should be stopped.The samecorrespondent had a conversation with Bromley yesterday and described him as very gloomy, hut added that that was his usual frame of mind.COMMUNIST ACTIVITY IN TE-3 TRADE UNIONSThe extent to which the Communists are influencing the miners1 strike was outlined in my la3t report:   there is aV    &apos;*(;;:* .v&apos;v      , - -,:;::^;,-..&apos;,;/v.:&apos;,,;-::-.&apos;       ,      -&apos;).;.-%^\;mass of evidence to show that they are endeavouring to permeateevery important union in which there is unrest.   The Workers&apos;Committees constitute the P^rfcj/1^ principal modus operand! andare rendering whole-hearted assistance to the plans for a strike of railwaymen am&quot;: transport workers on May 15th,On May 6th, J,R* Campbell and T, Kime, respectivelychairman and secretary of the Workers1 Committee movement,wrote to the Executive of the Communist Party:&quot;At the meeting of the 1UA.C, of the national Workers1 Committee held on May 5th tho position relative to bringing about an unofficial strike of railwayman and transport workers on May 15th was considered.   It was decided that concentration on the following districts would produce the best results, viz: Fife, Newcastle, Swansea, and Swindon,    W,J.C, Kirker has been appointed to control the Fife area; A,V, Williams, Newcastle; W.J, Eewlitt, Swindon; T, Thomas, Swansea,.,&quot;We respectfully ask the executive to instruct the Divisional Organisers to place the Party machinery in those districts at the disposal of those comrades and also to concentrate as many speakers as possible in the district under the control of the above comrades, 30 that the best possible results may be obtained,&quot;The following letter, written by Campbell to Eime onMay 8th, is illuminating comment on the industrial situationIn Glasgow:&quot;The dockers committee and the miners have worked well and the bringing about of the strike was largely due to the work; which they have put in throughout the week,v tfs J&amp; *n *.* &amp;h si* &apos;. * ,&apos; *     ..- *&quot;The miners will be sending in some men next weekand/
and by doin^ so the strike may be kept solid.   I wag thinking&apos; that if attempts are being raide to unload coal at other ports and the officials are afraid to move a leaflet appeal from tho Blas^ov; Dock Y/orhers1 Committee algfrt do some good.   If ,you think that this is de sir able in view of the situation at other ports you could consult Williams as the other member of the aub-committee and let me know by wire.&quot;I will report progress nightly if the situation o&amp;fcoa it necessary.&quot;Three of the Dockers&apos; Committee are..going on a deputation to the Kinning Park branch of the National Union of Railwaymen.&quot;I don&apos;t know if any results will accrue.   The Glasgow railwayraon arc a God Forsaken lot,&quot;As instances of the way in which individual propagandists are scattered about the country, it may be mentioned that Wprall and V7oodhoad are working railwayman in the Sheffield district;   Davis is at Doncaater, GoodchiId and Parr at Portsmouth; Beech is active among tho dockers at Hull, while Kegie and Harvey are responsible for ports in the Newcastle district; Turner is at Swansea and V/orrinapp at Portsmouth. Campbell has been in theMidlands, Horton is at Barrow and Roman! Pritchard has returned to the West Riding.The effect of Kegief3 activities may be gauged fromthe fact that he convened a special meeting of theNewcastle and District Council of the National Union ofRailway men on Jtfay 7th.   Forty-three delegates attended andthe following resolution was passed unanimously and sentto Unit? House,&quot;That we call upon our Executive Committee to -rive every assistance to the miners in their present struggle, and request the general aecretary to at once calx a special meeting of the Executive Committee to arrange to call a strike of all railwaymen on Sunday, Hay 15th, 1921, at 10 p.va*, as we believe that this is the only way to secure united action and success and prevent sectional stoppages, whioh are inevitable under present circumstances,&quot;tfha/
The percentage of extremists who hold offioe in the Amalgamated Engineering Union is abnormal and these men. are working&quot; to brine about a stoppage.   Ity Coventry correspondent reports that in 3pite of the unemployment and weakened financial position in the Amalgamated Engineering Union there is every indication that a strike or a lock-out will occur if the employers insist upon the suggested wage reduction.   In Leicester the communists are discussing the possibility of seizing the smaller engineering shops and running them &quot;when the strike commences&quot;.Tom Mann, who still hf.s a large following among the engineers,is one of the leading officials of the Bed Trade Union International and is in close touch with        Murphy, who has just returned from Moscow.   Cant, the London organiser of the Communist Party, is behind the action of the London members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, who are demanding that their Executive stand firm against any reduction in wages; the same men are now agitating for the withdrawal oY members employed at repair-ing yards in the docks.A secret document proves that instructions were issued in April for scecial attention to be devoted to ,the Electrical Trades Union and United Vehicle Workers and :,other selected bodies&quot;; at the London Conference of the Red Trade Union International on May 7th, the following trade union officials took a prominent part:Fred Thompson, District Secretary of the Dockers&apos; Union. 1G. Sanders, United Vehicle Workers.R. Homer, Crayford Amalgamated Engineering Union Uo. 5.Iff.. Jl Webb, District Secretary of the. Electrical Trades union,It is doubtful if the efforts to, bring about an unofficialstrike on May 15th will affect more than &apos; 15; of the membership.The great majority of trade unionists, even the engineers, will/hot follow an unofficial lead, although they obey their officials/blindly,
blindly, beoause the.7 iaar that any break from trade uniondiscipline may affect thttir benefits; the danger lies in the faothat the extremists are slowly but surely capturing executivepositions owinn to the apathy of trie rani: arid file, who will not attend branch and lodge meeting a.THE VST) TRADE UN ION INT  RNATIONALOn Hay 7th a conference of the London section of the RodTrade Union International was hold at Friers Rail, Blackfriars;Tom Mann was in the ohair and 353 delegates representing 217 traunion branches, attended.

Tanner represented the circulation of &quot;Solidarity&quot; aa11,500 whereas it was actually 8,000 and a number of theee oopiaa were distributed free.   The coat of an iosue was  60. 0- 8d. George Harvey has bed 4,000 copie8 eaoh week, but has not paid for them.   &quot;The Worker&quot; has been adopted as the organ of the movement as it shows a working basis with a small loss, whereas &quot;Solidarity&quot; has been a failure with a large loss.   There is,, however, some doubt aa to whether the Scottish Workers&apos; Committee will a low their organ to be placed under the absolute control of the National Administrative Council.AH01R5B MOSCOW C0B0HKS3An international congress of women communists is to be heldin Moscow and Klara Setkin, the representative of the InternationalWomen1s Bureau for countries outside Russia &quot;has power to provideandthe necessary funds/to help delegates in every possible way.&quot;   The delegates ere to go, when possible, via Berlin and it is probable that Bora Monteflore, e member of the Communist Party Executive, who hss already applied for a passport for the Continent will be one of the delegates from this country.The provisional agenda includes: (a) participation of working women in the struggle for the dictatorship of the proletariat; (b) methods of propaganda amongst proletarian women; (o) organisation of a secretariat and its work; (d) an International Working Women&apos;a Conference. MOSCOW RADIOSOn May 3rd a .radio was sent from Mosoow to the workers in leather industries of all nations urging them to prepare for the Conference on July 1st as Simon, Mahler and SasBenbach had rendered abortive the nroposal to convene a conference for April 20th. - On May 5th another Mosoow radio addressed to all Trade Unions of the chemical and glass-making industries invited the dieoatch of&apos; &apos; ;&quot;&apos;&apos;&quot;&apos;:;.rV::v;&apos;;!,&apos;: i* ***** &apos;; ., &apos;V;   ::delegates to a conference which will be held in Mosoow on June  Oth.While/
17 -316While these radios may not constitute a technical breach of the Trading Agreement in that they are not addressed expressly to 3ritieh writers they are proof, of Mo scow1 s ceaseless propaganda activity.In the following message, Moscow expresses direct interestin the Industrial situation in Orcat Britain:-&quot;The Central Federation of Railway and Water-Transport Workers of Soviet Russia considers it necessary to draw the attention of transport workers to the events which are happening in England.&quot;The miners could only ensure victory over the organised owners with the support of the workers of the industries affected by the strike.   They therefore counted on the aid of these workers.&quot;The miners were part of the Triple Alliance of miners, railwayman and transport workers, constituted in view of a oommon fight against capital.&quot;Tho Triple Alliance approved the miners&apos; strike, and should have supported them in their fight by declaring a sympathetic strike of all trade unionists belonging to the Alliance,&quot;But.instead of lending their helo, the leaders of the Triple Alliance have betrayed the miners on strike.   At the most.decisive-moment, when the owners had refused to- accept the demands of the workers, and the negotiations were interrupted, the leaders countermanded the strike; but although betrayed by those in whom they had nut all their confidence, the miners are carrying on.&quot;We know that the English transport workers are not responsible for this treason, which ought to show once again to the workers of England and all countries the toadyism of their official chiefs.&quot;Transport Worker Comrades, at the moment&apos;when in all countries the decisive fight is,engaged with the existing order, we should close our ranks&apos;and act with a common effort.&quot;We must submit all our organisations to a profound revision, and choose as leaders comrades not only in words but in facts, who are true revolutionaries, and who will never betray the workers.&quot;We should all group ourselves round &quot;the Red Trade Union International then we shall be secure of gaining final victory.&quot;THE C0rO?AMIVE MOVEMENT &apos;. There are signs of a revolt of co-eper*tors against theefforts to-link their societies with the Labour Party.   Quarterlymeetings/
meetings at Nuneaton and Dolton were attended by a record number of members and considerable opposition v/as shown to the suggested affilistion: at IJuneaten it was decided after a heated discussion to take a ballot on the matter and at Bolton a very large majoritydeoided against affiliation with any political body.   Co-operators are concerned chiefly with&apos;their dividends and are becoming aware of the probability that these will decrease if the Labour Party becomes a predominant factor in the movement. 5STS MD  rCQKV KIT IONS &apos;   &apos;On May 6th three communists named James Sown, Robert Murray and Peter Hannon were each sentenced at Rotherham Police Court to a fine of . 20 or one month&apos;s imprisonment for making speeches likely to cause disaffection among; the population.On the same day Thomas Mitchell, secretary of. the Socialist Labour Party, was charged with having published in the &quot;Socialist&quot; of April 14th, the article &quot;Under which Flag?&quot; which was quoted inj my report -Jo. 102.   The case was remitted to the:Sheriff for trialjArising from information oassed to the Portsmouth Police by I this Department John Frederick Redley, alias 0&apos;Hagan, aliasOsborne, v/as arrested on May Oth for having attempted to cause.. - pdisaffection in the Navy and Array.   Risw ife was also arrested andlcharged with having in her possession a large quantity of seditioJliterature.   Redley has previously been convicted for revolutional!speeches in Rotherham and Ireland.   Both nave been remanded until may 14th.On..May 7th Albert Inkpin, general secretary of the Communist j Party of Great Britain, was arrested and the premises at 16, King j Street raided.   On May 9th Inkpin was charged at the Mansion RousePolice Court with having procured the National Labour Pro s to april&apos; - &apos;   Jpublish and cause to be distributed the Theses and Statutes of thel Communist International.   Re was remanded until May 11th when a further remand w;;s granted until May 19th.On may 7th, John Henry Binnie was arrested at Rotherham for a speech likely to cause disaffection among the civilian populationmade/
made at College Square on May 5th.On May 8th Robert Stewart, the national organiser of the Communist Party of Great Britain, was arrested in London and taken to Pontypridd where he was charged on May 10th with making a speech &quot;likely to cause sedition and disaffection amongst the population&quot;.   Ho was formally remanded, bail being refused and was sentenced at Aberoynon Police Court to-day to three months&apos; hard labour.On Hay 9th two Irishmen named Anthony McHicholas and Thomas Moors, and an Englishman named John Swanton were sentenced to three months&apos; imprisonment at Hull for unlawfully embarking in the German steamship &quot;Haifaer&quot; in Alexandra Dock.   This steamship is known to have carried atowa-ays and undesirable literature.On May 10th William Henry Bishop of Birkenhead was charged with bating en A&amp;yil 16th made a statement likely to causa disaffection.   The case was postponed for two weeks.Meetings of the Irish Self-Determination League have been &apos; held in various parts of London and appeals made for aubsorlp-^ tlans and support of Sinn Fain nominees in the Irish election.JSome excitement has been caused in Sinn Fein circles in Glasgow owing to the arrest of Father MaoKory and threatening letters have been sent to the police.   On May 5th Sinn Feiners attempted to blow up nine telephone poles in the neighbourhood cf Barrhead; the explosions failed to bring down the wires, although the poles were damaged.   A number of Sinn Feiners who had decided to march into the country on Sunday last for drilling purposes cancelled the arrangement for their own safety.My correspondent thinks that a development of Sinn Fein activities is likely in the Dumbarton district, where the possibility of sabotage at public works and private residences is under discussion.   A number of Sinn Feiners have been caught drilling on the moors near Dumbarton; the police took their names/
names and addresses for subsequent prosecution.Drilling is reported to be talcing place in the   Garngad district of Glasgow, whore Sinn Feiners have a target 4ft. squareJ for instruction in musketry.   So far the meeting place has not located.  ^Explosives were found near the gasometers in the MaryhiJ; distriot on May 7th.   Further arrests have been made in conn action with the murder of Inspector Johnstons.A case of suspected incendiarism has occurred at Beldge Ball Farm, Adswood, Stockport; three Sinn Feiners are believed to have been implicated. IRELAND.     ,There has been considerable activity in the form of robberiei, on banks and raids on mails, and ambushes and attacks on police forces have been frequent, but, on the whole, the rebels have reaped but,little advantage, from their attacks and the Crown Forol have undertaken a considerable number of successful raids, particularly in the Dublin district.The robberies on banks are highly significant as indicating the necessity for obtaining money at all costs to continue the struggle.   There are indications that many of the younger members cf the rank and file of the Irish Republican. Army wish to get away from an organisation which involves much personal risk and does not appear to be making the headway that was expected a s,hor\time ago.The necessity to take to robbery to obtain money to supoort the army coupled with the large and successful hauls of arms and ammunition by the Crown Forces must re-act and discourse the ran]) and file of the Irish Senublloan Army.A dooument captured in a recent raid contains a return of %\ men and equipment of the Irish Republican Army.   Both are far smaller than was supposed.   An indication of the defective armament is given in the fact that it was thought necessary to record the number of pikes available for conflict.Rumours of peace moves are having a strengthening influence on the more moderato part;; of Sinn Fein and there is a tendency for/   -
SI -. for a gulf to form between the moderates and tho Military section of Sinn Fein, the&apos; Irish Republican Army.   It is probable that there will bo an increase in Irish Republican Army activities as a counterblast to the talk of peace moves.There is good reason for believing that the supply of funds from America may soon be dried up and that the influence of responsible Irish-Americans may be thrown into the scale for oeace. If this happens it will be within the next few weeks.Indications point to the fact that the Irish Republican Army are likely to maintain their policy of outrage and rebellion, the leadeis maintaining that they must continue to do so as long as the British Army is in the field and there is a state of war. If there is a prospect of peace which might be acceptable to Sinn Fein on the whole and the Irish Republican Army endeavour to repudiate it, it is -robable that the military side will find that they have under-rated the civil element who largely control the money bags from the United States of America.The rapid rise in looal rates is also disturbing the Sinn Fein r&apos;Governmont&quot; and rate collectors working on behalf of Sinn Fein are obtaining very unsatisfactory results.   All persons claim-ing for malicious injuries have been warned that they  do so at thoir own risk.   In the North the coming elections are looked upon as a trial of strength between the loyalists and Sinn Feiners&quot;VuJ, on the whole, disturbances may not be expected as neither the Sinn Peiners nor the -Nationalists wish to invalidate the polls.t   ThQ Belfast boycott is being vigurously enforced and is beginning to be felt and to alarm some of tho more timorous merchants.   3?Jiw arrest and deportation of Tnou.as Fuughaui of -Manchester has completely demoralised the Irish Self-Betermination League in the Worth of England.   Ro was a substantial man and one whom they could trust and they have great difficulty in replacing him.The shooting of Inspector Johnstone in Glasgow was asensational/
sensational affair.   The man Frank Somere was really Frank Certy, an important member of tho Irish Republican Arjny, antf the Irish Republican Brotherhood.   lie doubt this was the reason why they made suoh strenuous attempts to resoue him. K He had escaped previously from two Irish Jails.
SEDITIOUS XEAJFLETThe following is a oopy of leaflets which were placed Inthe pockets of soldiers1 uniforms on a foothall ground atBowhill on April 26th:AN APPEAL TO TED ,SOEDlJi!R8 OP GREAT BRITAINTOMMY,Now that the Miners are fighting to maintain a decent standard of living for their class, already the oppressors of the workers are asking themselves:   How shall we U3e the Crown forces to crush these workers?Already battalions of soldiers are being moved into strike areas.   For what purpose?TO DRIVE INTO SUBMISSION AMB SHOOT DOWN, Iff NEED BE, THESE WORKERS WHO ARE FIGHTING AGAINST STARVATION.You know how they put it.

Fully ohe&apos;ancl a half million workers will be directly involved, and workers in other industries will follow.For this fight is a class fight.A fight by the robber class for the right to further plunder.And a fi^ht by the working class to save themselves from ruin. &quot; &quot; &quot;If you illov? your^I 7^s to be us od against your own kith and kin - because tha men and women of the working class are your kith and kin -IT WILL MEAN CIVIL WARand/*APPENDIX
