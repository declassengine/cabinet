(THIS DOCmOTT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS 3PJ TAHITI C MAJESTY&apos; s GOVEIUKlfT)The enclosed memorandum has been prepared in consultation with the Admiralty, the Colonial Office, the India Office, the Ministry of Shipping and the Procurator General, and the recommendations made are agreed except for the question referred to on page 6 on whioh the India Office views are not in accordance with those of tho Treasury.The decision of the Cabinet is urgently required since the Colonial Office wish, to communicate with the Dominions in advance of the Imperial Cabinet *SECRET.CP, 2982.DISPOSAL OP OVERSEAS PRIZE.Memorandum by.,tthe Chancel1orm of the Exchequer.(intld.)   R.S.H.Treasury Chambera, S.\7.27th May, 1921.
overseas PRIZE,.lo   The decision of the Cabinet is required as to the disposal of ITaval Prize, &quot;being Droits of Admiralty^ condemned.&apos;in the Courts of the dominions and India (inclu&apos;uin  the detained ships and cargoes),Except incidentally this memorandum-doesr&quot;not deal with Droits of the Crown.   These 30 to the iTaval Prize Pund, in which the sailors of the Dominion navies share equally with those of the British .\&apos;.avy.2*    There appears to be no doubt th: t in law the Imperial Exchequer is entitled to all Droits of Admiralty whether they were captured at home or overseas, in view of the provisions of 3. 8 (l) of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1390.   But S, 8.(2) empowers His Majesty by Order in Council to direct that Droits condemned by a Court in a British possession shall form part of the revenues of that possession.   It is the view of the Colonial Office and the India Office that these powers should be exercised for the &quot;benefit of the Dominions, including Indiat!&quot;, on the ground thatp7  Broadly speaking these are ships captured in port.kIn the remainder of this memorandum the expression Dominions is to be understood to include India.
it would be Incompatible with their status that the Imperial &quot;Exchequer should.-claim the proceeds of prize seized in&quot; Dominion harbours and condemned by Dominion Courts,   The Treasury, is not prepared to admit that the claim of, the Imperial Exchequer to retain this prize rests on purely legal grounds. Though it is true that the Dominions either poseess their own navies or contribute towards the cost of the Imperial Kavy, it was the United Kingdom which bore the brunt of naval defence and naval expenditure and it was only the overwhelming strength of the British ITavy which rendered victory possible,K In these circumstances the Treasury consider that the Imperial Exchequer might fairly claim the full benefit of its legal rights,Nevertheless on broad grounds cf political expediency and subjeot to oertain conditions stated &quot;below, the Treasury is prepared to defer to the view of the Colonial Office and the India Office on this question,ZIndeed it may be argued that it was entirely owing to the British Havy that these ships were driven i*rto Portland became Prize at all, though it is doubtful whether this argument applies to the ships taken in Australian ports,,
3*     It is not, however, considered necessary to walvo the claim of the Imperial Exchequer to prize condemned in the Court&apos;;) of the other Colonies and Protectorates, including Egypt. (The Court of Alexandria is a Consular Court).4.     It is impossible as yet to give a final list of ships which are Droits of Admiralty, as certain cases remain to be adjudicated upon by the If aval Prize Tribunal, but the Dominion ships        lively to prove such were estimated by the Ministryxof Shipping last February to be worth approximately  2,365.000, Tho total value of Dominion cargo proVably does not exceed  80,000.The total value of the Prize in question is therefore roughly  2,500,000.     The value of Droits of Admiralty condemned in United Kingdom Courts (mainly cargoes) will probably prove to be about  3,500,000,   The figure for Sgypt is very uncertain but is probably at least  500,000:   that for the other Colonies and Protectorates is about  150,000,Prize Accounts are far from complete and these figures arc very spec&amp;lative, but. they may be taken as a rough guide. . to the amounts involved.5*     Details as to Dominion Prize being Droits of Admiralty are given in Appendix B,, from which it will be seen that the great bulk of it was captured by Australia and.India.   South African prize is worth only  210,000. and Canadian only  4,000, lie ships or cargo being Droits of Admiralty were seized by Hew Zealand .cr Newfoundland.     It is possible, therefore, that some of the Dominions may object, to the arrangement proposed.(though this is not anticipated by the Colonial Offioe) and may propose, a pooling arrangement. If so, however, they will be able to raise the question at the Imperial Cabinet. It is not considered advisable,The actual value is to-day considerably less. Moreover thefigures include several ships which have been sunk since capture and three Austrian vessels which,are not now expected tc be condemned.
for His Majesty&apos;s Government to &quot;suggest any pooling sohene.. 6.    The ships in question are practically all in the hands cf the Dominions concerned^ and it is most impE?obab,le that either Australia or India will he prepared to surrender them.7.    Most of the ships in question have been requisitioned by the Dominions and if the claim of the Imperial Government tc the ships themselves is waived, it follows that no claim can be laade in respect of the hire or earnings of these vessels, actual or constructive, while under requisition.8.     It is proposed therefore that it shall be intimated forthwith to the Dominion Governments concerned that should they so desire^, the Imperial Government is prepared to waive its claim in their favour, in respect both of ships and cargoes and of earnings, subject to certain conditions, the object of which is to secure(1) that the Dominions accept the corresponding liabilities and(2) that accounting is1 reduced to the minimum. It should, however, be made clear in the communi-cations to be sent by the Colonial office and India Office that if the scheme does not meet with general acceptance by the Dominions, the whole question must be reconsidered.8.    The following are the conditions suggested.(1)South Africa has been allotted other tonnage in lieu of three cf the ships actually seized by her.a-It is necessary to give this option as Canada may find it more profitable not to accept the arrangement owing to the liabilities involved.- 4 -
The Dominion Governments shall assume liability for un-r9covered expenditure connected with all local prize actions (both Droits cf the Grown and Drolls of Admiralty) including legal expenses and grants made on the recommendation of the Prize Claims Committee, in so far as these have not been repaid,Tne phrase &quot;imrecovered expenditure&quot; is intended to cover all expenses connected with Prize proceedings repayment for which cannot be obtained by charges against claimants or against proceeds of sale, oi* in the case of Droits of the Crown by claims against the Naval Prize Fund under the Naval Prize Act, 1913.Xt should be noted that the proceeds of Droits of the Crown go to tho Naval Prize Fund but that certain expenses e.g. legal expenses in connection with condemnation would in the absence of this stipulation fail upon the Exchequer.    As however the Imperial Government is renouncing its title to the Droits of Admiralty which would reimburse it for such expenses it is considered reasonable that as part of thegeneral settlement proposed the Dominions should accept this liability.As between the Imperial and Dominion Governments no claim shall be made by either party in respect of biro or earnings of prize ships utilised by the other and any 3ums already paid by either par-by on this account shall he re-funded.     The &quot;owning&quot; party will be entitled to reclaim, or to set off against the above refund, any actual expenses incurred during the period of the loan of the vessel (eug. by way. of running expenses), but not constructive expenses such as interest on capital, depreciation, etc,     Nor shall.any claim be made by either party in respect of the value ofa ship
a ship taken up by tho other- party and lost while in its aervicov   ?ow if any cash adjustments will then be required but a special settlement will be.necessary 7/ith the Union&apos; of South Africa,     (See footnote onpage 4)oIn point of fact while several Dominion ships have been lost in the service of the Imperial Government thero are no converse cases0The India Office are hot at present prepared to waive thoir claims tinder this head.It was thought when the subject was originally discussedthat no payments had hitherto been made by the imperialGovernment to the Dominions or vice versa, for hireof Prize Vessels.     It now appears however that theMinistry of Shipping gave an undertaking to pay intoCourt the value of certain India ships requisitioned&apos;by them and lost whilst in their service (this wasnot of course an acknowledgment of liability to theIndian Government since legally the ships in question were the property of the Imperial Government)*Further it appears that the Ministry of Shipping have paid over to India the sum of about  820.,000 as growshire of certain Indian Prize vessels taken over bythem.     Payments amounting to over  220,000 were also made by tho Ministry cf Shipping to the australian government as gross hire in similar circumstances.It is possible that there have been other similarpayments on either side, though the above payments are all that have been discovered so far.The view of the Treasury is that if, as suggested,payment is net to be made by one party for theemployment
employment of vessels which mader^the-&apos;*pi*opoeed-set-tie^ ment will belong to the other party, it follows that payments which have been already made provisionally and without prejudice to the final decision as to the ownership of the vessels should be refunded as part of the general settlement, subject to payment of actual expenses as proposed above (paragraph 8 (2)).   It is understood that the Colonial Office are prepared for their part to accept the Treasury view as part of a general settlement applied equally all round, though they cannot of course undertake that this view will he accepted by the Dominions so far at any rate as relates to the refund of payments already made.    It is suggested that the Cabinet should approve in principle the con-ditions proposed by the Treasury under this head, leaving it to the Dominions concerned to question the decision should they see fit.The net amounts which would be recoverable from India and Australia on this basis are estimated at about  434,000 and  114,000 respectively, It should be made clear that the arrangement In no way effects the liability of the Dominions to the Naval Prize Fund for the appraised value of all Prizes requisitioned by them which have been declared Droits of the Crown, plus compound interest at 4$ calculated at half-yearly intervals from date of delivery. This is already agreed but it is desirable that it should be set out to avoid any possible misunderstandings-6a-
