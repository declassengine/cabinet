This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.SECRET.CP. 2925.THE CABINET.THE SITUATION IN NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA AS AFFECTING THE REDUCTIONS IN THE MILITARY GARRISON.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate herewith a memorandum prepared by the General Staff on. the situation in Northern Mesopotamia as affecting the reductions in the Military Garrison.L. W. E.The War Office,10th May, 1921.1. At the Conference held at Cairo in March, 1921, certain proposals were agreed to under which the garrison of Mesopotamia should be reduced to a strength of 23 battalions (and certain units of the other arms), this reduction to be effected by the eud of June, 1921.These proposals were accepted by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Mesopotamia, and the War Office, under two general conditions, viz.: (a.) That it was unnecessary to take into account the possibility of organized attack or intrigue from outside, or serious internal disturbances.(b.) That the outposts beyond Mosul could be withdrawn and their places taken by the Arab forces, and that the garrison of Mosul itself could be reduced.2. The Mosul outposts mentioned in 1 (b) are at present those at Akra, Zakho, Dohuk and Tel Afar, * The troops occupying these points amount to approximately 1^ battalions of infantry with 1 pack battery, and, in order to allow the reduction of garrison to proceed according to plan, they should he withdrawn before the end of this month.3. On 18th April the High Commissioner for Mesopotamia telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies (No. 29, dated 18th April, 1921), giving five instances of intrigue and disturbance in the vicinity of the frontier, and stating that in these circumstances the withdrawal of outposts was impossible. The Secretary of State replied on 22nd April (No. 32, dated 22nd April, 1921), that these incidents did not come under the head of &quot; organized attack, immunity from which was the assumption on which Cairo proposals were based.&quot; He, therefore, stated that reduc-tions must continue as arranged.On 26th April, the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Mesopotamia, telegraphed (No. X 2059, 26th April, 1921) that he had ordered reductions to continue, in view of Mr. ChurohuTs statement to the High Commissioner that endeavours were being-made to come to an agreement with the Turks. But he added that, if the Turkish situation continued unsettled, it would be quite impossible to proceed with the reductions.4. It will be observed that the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in his telegram No; 32 of 22nd April, omits one of the essential conditions of the Cairo agreement, viz., the&apos; absence of intrigue. The Army Council, while agreeing that the incidents described by Sir Percy Cox do not come under the heading of &quot; organized attack,&quot; nevertheless consider that these incidents undoubtedly indicate the presence of active intrigue, and, therefore, that the assumptions on which the reductions were based, are not, to that extent, justified by facts.5. It must be noted that the only method by which the Mosul garrison and its outposts could be maintained at their present strength, while the specified reductions of(b21/180)  100  5/21  h&amp;3, ltd  9180wo
the total garrison were carried out, would be the weakening of the mobile central force at Baghdad. The policy of reducing this mobile force, in order to provide immobile detachments beyond reach of support, would be in the highest degree unsound, and neither the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Mesopotamia, nor the Army Council could for a moment support such a policy. The strength of the mobile force, the localities to be held by fixed garrisons, and the composition of these garrisons, were the subject of very careful investigation by the Cairo Conference, and the object in view was to maintain the smallest possible force consistent with security. Any departure from the arrangements made at Cairo, such as is now being considered, would, unless accompanied by a proportionate increase in troops, weaken the position of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Mesopotamia, in a double sense, i.e.t it would increase the area for the security of which he is responsible, and at the same time it would, by reducing his reserves, lessen his power to deal with disturbances either in the Mosul district or in any other part of Mesopotamia.6. To sum up, then, we are faced with two alternatives: (a.) To withdraw the Mosul outposts and reduce the Mosul Garrison, in order to allow the reductions in Mesopotamia to proceed according to plan,or,(b.) To suspend the reductions for the time being, in order to allow the Mosul garrison and outposts to be maintained as at present.The question has been carefully considered by the Inter-Departmental Committee on Middle Eastern affairs, and, as the result, a telegram has been despatched to the General Officer Commandirig-in-Chief, Mesopotamia (No. 88883, dated 3rd May, 1921), informing him of the alternatives, and asking for an assurance that, should His Majesty&apos;s Government decide to adopt (a), he will be able to maintain his position in Mosul itself.
