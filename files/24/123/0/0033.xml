(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY/S OtOVIJOOVKRRMW.)I s:ecret    ,     (com-CcP.2923 (C).   THEmmittee   of   Home   Affairs 0C A B I N 73 T .british   WHITE   LEAD   INDUSTRY,Memorandum by the&apos; Board of trade the total quantity of White Lead produced in the United Kingdom in 1907 was/ according to the Census of Production, approximately 50,000 tons&apos;, valued at rather over a million sterling.This 50,000 tons includes some 14,000 white lead made into paint by the v;hite lead makers themselves, and the total normal production immediately before the war was probably slightly above, say, 55,000 tons.   Of this some 20,000 tons was exported as such, at a value of about half a million sterling.,   . The total world production of white lead, approxi-mates to 275,000 tons annually, the United States producing about 120,000 tons, and all other&apos;countries (excepting the United Kingdbm) accounting for 100,000 tons  ,   .  - The 50,000 tons produced in the United Kingdom involved pig lead consumption of about 40,000 tons, and the world&apos;s production accounts for 220,000 tons of pig lead out of a total world consumption of about 1,000,000 tons of pig.lead.Quite 85$ of the white load produced is used in paint making,&apos; thus any prohibition on the use of -white lead for paint,must involve a substantial and permanent diminution in the demand for lead, - a serious matter for lead mines in the Empire, seeing that over one quarter of the world&apos;s total lead consumption was before the war satisfied from mines within the British Empire.   The matter becomes still more serious in that the British Empire ores are in the main complex.ores, and must be separated orconcentrated into ltea&apos;d concentrates and zinc concentrates^
and then worked up (or alternatively sold) remuneratively-for both lead arid zinc in order to make mining pay*The important white lead makers in this country refine and desilverize pig lead, and until a few years before the war desilverizing was an important British indue trys   Conditions in Mexico and the decision (during the war) of the Australian Government to refine lead in Australia gave a severe blow to the English desilverizing trade, and anything destroying the white lead industry will go far towards extinguishing the lead desilverizing, and lead smelting industries in this country, which, though distinct trades, are frequently carried on in association0The chief industries (lead mining and. lead desilver-&apos; /izing and smelting) preceding (in manufacturing sequence) the white lead industry having been considered, those following will now be consideredoThe outstanding consumer of white lead is the paint trade, which consumed not only 85^ - ioe0 27,000 tons of the British made white lead retained in the country, but also gome 12,000 - 15,000 tons imported from abroadc,The capital employed in the paint and varnish trade was before the war approximately  8,000,000 (this estimate includes certain trades - e.gc varnish-makingv .which do not consume white lead, but the industries are closely allied, and any serious set back to the British paint trade is certain to affect the associated trades); and the annual value of the paste paints and r^ady mixed paimts produced in the United   Kingdom was before the war of the order of  4,000,000, of which approximately 60$ in value was exported.f
The fundamental basis of BMtish-made paint Is white leadj if the use of white lead be prohibited not only will this valuable export trade be .V\st,but our own hone consumption of paint will have to be supplied from abroad, either as zinc white, lithopone, or as 1 early white, and to cover similar areas much more will have to be paid for the required paint, even assuming that the price of the foreign zinc paints does not rise in con-sequence of the increased demand.2, Whitehall Gardens, 1,,13th June, 1921,
