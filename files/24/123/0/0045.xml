This document is the property of His Britaiinic Majesty&apos;s Government      221SECRET. 66CP. 2940.THE CABINET.THE FUTURE SUPPLY OP CORDITE.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAE.The question of the future of the National Cordite Factories, Gretna, Waltham Abbey and Holton Heath, which was discussed by the Finance Committee of the Cabinet on 17th February, 1921, and referred to the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for War, has been further investigated by the Departments concerned, and formed the subject of a Conference held at the War Office on 20th April.There were present The First Lord, the Third Sea Lord, and the Director of Armament Supply. The Secretary of State, the Finance Member, the Quartermaster-General,the Master-General of the Ordnance, the Surveyor-General of Supply,the Secretary and the Secretary (f).The interpretation put upon the conclusions of the Finance Committee was that the Cabinet was anxious to reduce expenditure by maintaining one Government Factory only, and was inclined to the view that Holton Heath, being a modern factory,, was preferable to Waltham Abbey. The Finance Committee appreciated the fapt that it was necessary for the Army to carry out its research work under conditions that would ensure secrecy, but felt that this could probably be done at Holton Heath, while the Army could depend on the trade for peace production and on Gretna for expansion in war. The Finance Committee was understood to be willing to face any difficulties that might arise in connection with the closing of Waltham Abbey.At the Inter-Departmental Conference it was represented on behalf of the Admiralty that the paramount consideration in the minds of the Board was the question of the safety of His Majesty&apos;s ships. The view expressed by Lord Moulton&apos;s Committee that it would be dangerous to manufacture Army cordite alongside Naval cordite owing to the risk of contamination of the latter has been confirmed by further enquiry. The responsibility of the Board in this matter was so great that in no circumstances could they abandon this position.It was further explained that, though it would be possible to carry out research work for the Army at Holton Heath, this would entail a joint research establishment and the isolation of work on Army cordite in buildings set apart for t the purpose. When the stage is reached at which an explosive, though still experimental, is required to be produced on a manufacturing scale, this might entail the erection of special buildings and plant at a considerable cost. ,To manufacture cordite at Holton Heath to Army specification to meet the peace requirements of the Army, which the Moulton Committee regarded as inadvisable, would be an even more serious matter, and would entail such an extension of existing buildings as to amount to all intents and purposes to the erection of a new factory, which must be isolated from the existing factory.The representatives of the Admiralty consequently were strongly of opinion that Holton Heath should remain a purely Naval factory.The representatives of the War Office were not in a position to contest this view. They emphasized once more the necessity for carrying out not only research work but for proving their experiments on a manufacturing scale under conditions of secrecy.They also pointed out that if they were confined to the trade for peace production, the Explosives Combine, which has a monopoly in this country, could, and probably would, put up the price of tcordite to a point which, in a few years&apos; time, when the peace requirements of the. Army will have increased from the 15 tons a week mentioned at the Finance Committee to perhaps 75 tons a week, would be a serious consideration. Before the war, trade cordite was costing from 40 per cent, to 60 per cent, more than that made at Waltham Abbey.(B21/186)   100  5/21   H&amp;S, Ltd.   9192wo70Gen. No4722&quot;&quot;
The Conference felt that in these circumstances it was impossible to recommend the retention of Iiolton Heath only, unless the Army were prepared to accept naval cordite. The War Office representatives &quot;could not accept this for reasons stated at length in the report of the Moultan Committee, The cost of naval cordite at present is one-third greater and while it may be possible as a result of further research to find a propellant that is suitable for both services, this cannot be expected for some years to come.The conclusion reached by the Conference was that the Army must for the present retain a factory of their own.If this conclusion is accepted, it remains to consider the alternatives open to the War Office.The report of the War Office Committee, submitted to the Cabinet by the late Secretary of State for War in CP. 2411, put forward the following alternatives : (1.) To retain Gretna, dispose of Waltham Abbey and subsidize the Trade to maintain a certain capacity.   (Capacity 1,000 tons a week.)(2.) To retain Waltham Abbey and enter into an arrangement with the Trade to maintain Gretna at a fixed charge for 3 years and a certain trade capacity as well.   (Capacity 1,250 tons a week.)The War Office Committee recommended the. second alternative. The military requirements, the financial and other data on which this recommendation was based were set out in CP. 2411.The only new factor in the case that has arisen since this report was made, is that the military authorities m the War Office have pointed out that the.recommendation of the Committee was based on the desirability of maintaining capacity in this country to meet the full requirements of the Army for a 20-division war. During the great war we imported half our propellant from America. If pressed in the interests of economy, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and the Master-General of the Ordnance are now disposed to waive the necessity for maintaining the full capacity in this country.(3.) This brings a third course within the region of practical politics, namely, to retain Waltham Abbey, dispose of Gretna and subsidize the Trade (capacity 600 tons a week), but it is necessary to point out that it would take from 18 months to 2 years to re-establish a cordite factory on the scale of Gretna if this factory is disposed of.It is for the Cabinet to decide whether this is too great a risk to incur.I recommend that for the next 3 years the second course should be approved.L. W.-E.The Wah Office,\Z*May, 1921.
