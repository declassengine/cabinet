ON THE GENERAL SITUATION IN IRELAND EOR WEEK ENDING 21st MAY,1921.(Circulated by the Secretary of State for War).lo GSNERAti MILITARY SITUATIONSThe week has passed quietly and there has been no recurrence of the intense rebel activities which took place during the week end dealt with in my last report. .The inactivity of the rebels may be due to their desire to create a less unfavourable impression in the minds of electors in the North of Ireland during the Elections in the six counties..It is probable that polling day may produce some riots in the larger towns of the North, but no general disturbance is anticipated.     The Cameronians have been moved from the 5th Division Area to the 1st Division Area temporarily.   Two Auxiliary Companies IUI.C. have also been moved into the 1st Division Area.In Dublin, during the raid, the Dublin issue (several hundred copies) of &quot;An TT0glac&quot; for the following day, was captured.     In the country the most noteworthy incident has been the capture at Silmacthomas, Co. Waterford of thirteen rebels who were surprised while apparently on their way to u  . rendezvous;   some.arms, bicycles and important documents were \ taken from them*Near Kilmoena* Co. -Galway a party of R.I.C* after being ambushed by rebels, attacked the rebel position killing four and wounding five.     Twelve firearms of various descriptions were also captured. -   Recent raids by rebels have been directed to the capture of bicycles, telephone, instruments and tarpaulins from railways, while recently raids were made on several opticians shops in Dublin and a large quantity of field glasses stolen. y vp.H.Q.
