This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.32SECRET.CP. 2927.THE CABINET. BATTLEFIELD&quot;MEMORIALS.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.Lord Midleton&apos;s Committee on National Memorials on Battlefields, the report of which I circulated to the Cabinet on the 28th February last (CP. 2642), has had under consideration the decision of the Cabinet held on the 8th March (12(21)). The Committee were asked to advise the Cabinet as to the best method of utilizing the sum of GO,000/. for memorials other than at Ypres.With regard to France, the Committee recommend that two memorials should be erected.(1.) A memorial in Paris, which should take the form of the Cenotaph, on which should he recorded the total British casualties. It would not be advisable to throw open the design for this Cenotaph to public competition; it should be left to Sir Edwin Lutyens, who designed the Cenotaph in Whitehall.The Committee recommend that the French Government should be approached through the Foreign Office as regards a site, and that the erection of the Cenotaph should be dependent upon the grant by the French Government of a suitable site in a conspicuous position in the Capital.(2.) A memorial should be erected at La Ferte-sous-Jouarre as recommended in the Committees original report, and the design for this memorial should not be thrown open to public competition.As regards the memorial at Gallipoli, the Committee are given to understand by the representatives of the Australian Commonwealth that the Commonwealth was anxious to contribute towards the expenses of a joint memorial at Helles. Similarly, the High Commissioner for New Zealand agreed to telegraph to the New Zealand Government to ascertain whether his Government were prepared to subscribe to a fund for such a memorial on the understanding that the total cost would be in the neighbourhood of 20,000 With regard to the memorials in France, the Chairman of the Committee has addressed a letter to the Foreign Office asking that the Municipal Authorities of La Fertd-sous-Jouarre should he approached, through the usual diplomatic channels, as to whether they are agreeable to the erection of the memorial on the south bank of the Marne, and, similarly, that the French Government should be approached as to whether they are prepared to grant a conspicuous site in Paris for the proposed Cenotaph.Before taking action, the Foreign Office has informed Lord Midleton that Lord Curzon wishes to receive assurance that these proposals have been definitely approved and sanctioned by the Cabinet.With regard to the memorial at Gallipoli, the Committee recommend that the total cost should be in the neighbourhood of 20,000^., which the Cabinet previously allotted for memorials to the Army, other than at Ypres. At the same time, the Committee are unable to formulate a definite suggestion as to the form which the memorial at Gallipoli should take, until General Sir Aylmer Hunter-Weston and a Naval officer, deputed by the Admiralty, have reported as to the most suitable site and form for a memorial at Gallipoli.General Hunter-Weston and the officer deputed by the Admiralty are now investigating the rnatcer on the spot, and their reports will be considered by the Committee and submitted for Cabinet decision as soon as they are received. In the meantime, Lord Midleton, Chairman of the Committee, is anxious that the necessary negotiations should be undertaken by the Foreign Office for the sites at La Ferte-sous-Jouarre and in Paris, and I, accordingly, ask that Cabinet authority may be given to the Foreign Office to proceed.With regard to the memorial at Ypres, the question of contributions from the Dominions towards the total amount required is receiving the attention of the Colonial Secretary who, I understand, is sending to the Dominion Governments a more detailed explanation of the proposals than has hitherto been submitted to them.L. W.-E., The War Office,l\th May, 1921.0321/173)  100 5/21  h&amp;s, ltd. 916gwo
