SUMMARY.GENERAL.The movement away from Communism in Russia is continuing. -Probably this movement among the dominant party represents the actual state of affairs, and Lenin&apos;s conviction that Communism must temporarily be abandoned if anything is to be saved from the wreck of Russia is genuine enough. There is a marked tendency among the revolutionaries of the western world to favour the Red Trade Union International rather than Communist or other political revolutionary movements as an instru-ment of world revolution.FRANCE.The Labour Movement in France is weaker than it has been for a long time. The C.G.T. is seriously weakened by its quarrels with the Communists, and can hardly be said to exist as a fighting organisation.Zalewski, &quot; the Eye of Moscow,&quot; has been released and passed over the Swiss frontier.   He was subsequently arrested by the Swiss police.Moscow is reported to have ordered the Russian Communists in France to break away from the French Trades Unions. The action is important, as presumably meaning the abandonment of the germ cell system in France.BELGIUM.The Socialists suffered a severe set-back in the Communal elections. The defeat was most marked where the Extremists presented themselves.ITALY.The conclusion of a trade agreement with Russia appears to be &apos; imminent,   ft is suggested that concessions in South Russia will be granted to Italy, on more favourable conditions than were given to Great Britain.The elections have left the composition of the Chamber practically unchanged. The expected heavy Socialist losses did not take place. It is not improbable that Fascist excesses caused a reaction in favour of the Socialists.SPAIN.The Spanish Socialist Party has definitely split over the question of adherence to Moscow. The dissentients have joined the Third International. The Young Socialists have also left the old Party for the . Third International.There is still much unrest in Barcelona, but the city is quieter.Any successful attempt at revolution seems improbable.NORWAY.A decided movement towards Communism is reported. The Nor-wegian Labour. Party has accepted the Moscow programme and the extremists have also captured the society known as &quot; Norway&apos;s Social Democratic Sociely of Youth.&quot; The new Social Democratic Party appears to have little influence.Moscow seems to have decided that the time lias come for energetic action in Scandinavia,A 2
SWEDEN,There are signs of a movement from tho Communist Party to the more moderate minority party.Trade with Russia is not prospering, owing to the experience Swedish business men are obtaining of Bolshevik commercial methods.HOLLAND.The Communists appear to be losing ground.   There are signs of internal dissention in tho party.GERMANY.The Communist Party appears on the whole to have been much shaken and divided by the effects of the recent Putsch. Paul Levi has been expelled by the Central Committee of the Party.An agreement with Russia was signed on the 6th May.Industrial circles in Upper Silesia are said to be much disquieted by the activities of Hugo Stinnes.AUSTRIA.Communist agitation continues, but has failed to stir the people. The Juvenile Communists have decided to work through revolutionisingthe Trade Unions.Pan-German propaganda is active.   The Karlist movement is gainingno recruits.CZECHOSLOVAKIA.Weakness and confusion are prevalent among the Communists. The activity of the Government has made their position very difficult.RUSSIA.Lenin continues to drift away from Communism. He is reported to have offered the Communist Party the choice between a radical change of policy or his resignation. There are indications of a movement directed against him. Lenin&apos;s present orientation&apos; has obviously been taken merely from expediency.Under the new scheme for co-operation considerable freedom of trade is granted to the co-operatives. The double task of the co-operatives is to exchange articles of industry for agricultural products, and to distribute food and other commodities gathered in the country or imported.M. Krassin went to Moscow to persuade the Soviet to entrust all the Russian activities outside Russia to him.The failure of the Kronstadt rising is said to have caused bitter feeling against foreign countries, especially Great Britain.ESTHONIA.The Government is in difficulties regarding its attitude towards Russia. The Communists are becoming more truculent. The Esthonian Government has adopted a scheme for the segregation of undesirables.GREECE.Recent labour troubles are said to foreshadow a big effort. There are, however, serious dissensions in the Communist ranks.SIBERIA.Anti-Bolshevik risings continue, and the peasants are everywhere in revolt against the Soviet regime. The peasant movement is, however, greatly hampered by lack of unity.
CANADA.Unemployment seems, on the whole, to have decreased.Revolutionary movements may be attempted. Agitation is conducted through foreign countries.Labour troubles continue, but the Unions generally have little money, and the men are dissatisfied with their leaders.AUSTRALIA.A serious split has occurred in the extremist ranks and it is difficult to know which of the two extreme parties really represents the Third International. Bolshevism, however, makes very little appeal to Australian labour.UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.The problem of unemployment remains very serious. It is aggra-vated by labour unrest and by numerous strikes. Employers are making general wage reductions.The American headquarters of the Third International have been raided. It is reported that documents revealing preparations for a revolution were found.THE ARGENTINE.Labour unrest is serious throughout the country. It is aggravated by the habituai surrenders of the Government to the claims of the Extremists.
CONFIDENTIAL.REPORT No. 29, MARCH 1921.erratum.*Page 14, 26th line from foot of page. After &quot; Mr. John T. 0&apos;Kelly &quot; insert &quot; the Sinn Fein representative in Paris.&quot;A Review of Revolutionary Movements in Foreign Countries.PART I.1. latin countries. france. .the internal situation.At present France as a whole is freer from strikes and labour troubles than it has been for many years past. The French revolutionaries are in a critical state, if one may judge from the significant failure of the May Day demonstrations and the cynical indifference shown to the orders of the Confederation Generale du Travail to cease work. One writer goes so far as to dub May Day the Black Sunday of French labour, and to talk despairingly of the complete loss by the Confederation Generale du Travail of the direction, the confidence, and the revolutionary spirit of organised labour in France. &quot; Le Peuple &quot; for its part declares that May 1st marks the date of a set-back for the organised workers.Henceforth the only fight that is thought worth waging is that against the executive members of the Confederation Generale du Travail.&quot; It is by now evident that the Confederation Generale du Travail no longer exists as a fighting organisation and that it hardly represents the rank and file. Jouhaux and his colleagues attribute their failure to the machinations of Moscow ; the hotheads retort on weaknesses of direction. The unions are rent by internecine struggles between extremists and moderates. The extremists threaten to stop paying subscriptions to the Confederation Generale du Travail. It is reported that the Administra-tive Commission of the Confederation Generale du Travail will invite all adhering organisations to respect the resolutions of the National Con-gresses and Committees in order to avoid the complete breakdown of Trade Unionism,communism.The French Communist Party is reported to number at present 122,308 adherents. The Unified Socialist Party had some 131,000 adherents before the scission. Besides &quot;L&apos;Humanite&quot; and &quot;LTnter-nationale &quot; the party has about 4.0 other newspapers in various parts of France,
&quot; LTnternationale,&quot; a new Paris evening venture, is edited by Daniel Ronoult and published from the offices of &quot; L&apos;Humanite.&quot; Longuefs paper, &quot; Le Populaire,&quot; has been turned from an evening into a morning paper.The Confederation Generale du Travail is proceeding successfully with the expulsion of the few Trade Unions which adhere to the Third International. The latest unions to be expelled are &quot;those to which the Paris accountants, commercial travellers, and &quot; free &quot; schoolmasters belong. These unions are connected with the National Federation of Commercial Employees, which lately held a stormy conference at Limoges, ending in a definite split between Extremists and Moderates.Moscow is reported to have ordered the Russian Communists in France to break away from the French Trades Unions, either by not joining the unions or by not renewing subscriptions. The reason of these orders is said to be the opinion that trade union policy is based on bourgeois ideas, and the increasing police surveillance of the internal life of the unions. The action is important, as presumably meaning the abandonment of the germ-cell system in France.The Left Wing elements of French Socialism have formed a Central Committee of Action to prevent War. One sentence of its manifesto says : &quot; Neither reparation nor justice is involved in this attempt to steal the Ruhr.&quot; The workers are called upon to oppose a new war by all means, including a general strike.Rene Aperce, alias Rene Reynaud, an active militant, one of the young leaders of the French Communist Party, was arrested early in April as Boris Souvarine&apos;s courier in entering France from Luxembourg, bearing numerous communist tracts and reports emanating from Berlin. Aperce has long been in close touch with German Communists; he deceived funds from various pan-Germanist groups. &quot; LTIumanite &quot; has been so discreet over the whole affair as not to mention Aperce&apos;s arrest.Public opinion has heard with sardonic amusement of a &quot;strike of morality &quot; at the Workmen&apos;s Glass Works at Albi, where tne men are asking, not for more wages, but for a clearance of the board of manage-ment. Charges of duplicity, lies, forgeries, and attempts at swindling are freely made, and the Communist managers of this workmen&apos;s industrial concern are even accused of issuing false balance sheets. The workmen complain that the directors force them to live in an atmosphere of moral dishonesty &quot; and discredit the concern in a social and trade union sense.Zalewski discharged.Zalewski, or Abramovitch, &quot; the Eye of Moscow,&quot; has been released from the Sante prison, and, with his wife, conducted to the Swiss frontier. Zalewski was subsequently arrested by the Swiss police in virtue of a warrant issued against him in December 1919. The other persons con-cerned in the affair have all been set at liberty, the Public Prosecutor having decided that no act harmful to the internal security of the State has been committed. It is reported that Zalewski has been succeeded by one Zaroubaeff, who will direct Bolshevik propaganda in France from Geneva.Russian Intrigues.An agent from Moscow, said to be named Xinoff Baal, alias Tander, is reported to have arrived in Paris with the object of organising a Red May Day. He had large sums of money deposited with certain Russian bankers in Paris. Xinoff has visited extremist leaders and the offices of extremist papers, to which he is said to have given large subsidies.
The &quot;rule,&quot; a Russian paper published in Berlin, is responsible for a story that Vorovski, the representative of the Russian Soviet hi Rome, has attempted to sell in Paris jewels valued at 850,000,000 francs, but actually worth considerably more. No sale took place, the &quot;prospective buyers having been warned that the jewels were liable to seizure on behalf of creditors of Russia.During his stay in Berlin Vorovski is reported to have told the leading German Communists that he was going to Italy, not only as official representative of the Soviet, but as the agent of the Executive Committee of the Third International for France, Italy, Switzerland, Holland, Spain, Portugal, and Yugo-Slavia. He confessed that France would receive his chief attention, Moscow having decided to concentrate on that country. Work in France was not to be given to incompetent local agents, but &quot;carried out by agents or&apos; the Third International and of the Soviet Government.&quot; Vorovski intimated that when he bad estab-lished himself in Rome he would convene French, Swiss, and Italian Communists and explain his plan of work to them.Miscellaneous.The French Communist Party has made a gift of 10,000 francs to the fund being raised in England to help the miners.The Chamber has rejected a proposal that German railway employees in Alsace-Lorraine should be dismissed in favour of ex-strikers. The railway companies will apparently be permitted to reinstate ex-strikers if they wish to do so.It is suggested that Sinn Fein, stores may possibly be replenished by the smuggling of hand grenades and small ammunition from the dump at Dannes-Camiers, near Boulogne.&quot; Irlande a Jamais &quot; is a book of uninspired verse glorifying Sinn Fein and its &quot; martyrs,&quot; and published by the Breton Nationalist Party. This party seems to have for object to represent Brittany as an Ireland in France, and to claim for it complete independence.BELGIUM.A Socialist Setback.The communal elections have resulted in a decided setback for the Socialists, most marked wherever the Bolsheviks took part in the electoral battle. The &quot;Front&quot; party and the Activists were defeated. wherever they presented themselves. A distinct Socialist check occurred at Brussels and at Antwerp. Actually in. most of the cities the Socialists are the smallest group in the municipal councils. In the industrial district of Hainault the Socialists have been successful; here the Liberals have lost ground, but the Catholics, who have benefited most by the women&apos;s vote, have gained. The Flamingants have been entirely unsuccessful, though in many Flemish communes the Socialists gained ground. The great defeat was that of Camille Huysmans, secretary of the International Socialists, at Antwerp. So confident of victory was Huysmans that he had bought a small house where he proposed to live as future burgomaster of Antwerp.The Industrial Situation.The strike in England has acted very markedly on the Belgian coal-fields, where output has greatly increased. Great quantities of coal are being loaded on British vessels at Antwerp and Ghent, and Belgian coal is meeting the failure of British supplies to Holland.
ITALY.Corrections.A reference in last month&apos;s review to Father 0&apos;Flanagan, the Sinn Fein leader, may seem to have implied that he is in Rome. This is not so.The Sinn Fein demonstration held in Rome during March, and described in last month&apos;s review, was paid for by Gavan Duffy.Official and industrial circles have watched tho strike with interest. M. Lombard, Socialist Deputy and President of the Miners&apos; Union, has expressed a hope for the early settlement of the dispute, as a. prolonged strike is likely to lead to agitation and possible unrest among the Belgian miners. The present accumulation of coal at the pitheads, caused by the industrial crisis, may combine with the fluctuations of price to force the consideration of further reductions of wages in tho near future. In this case the miners&apos; organisation would seriously consider a general strike.The movement for the reduction of wages, taking as basis the reductions accepted by the miners, has now become pretty general. Workers at Liege and Ghent have accepted reductions, but the National Committee of Metal Workers have maintained their decision not to accept any reduction for April. Strike notices were handed in In those districts where the masters proposed a reduction.Metal workers in the Charleroi region have protested against any reduction in salaries until the question had been examined by the National Mixed Commission. They passed unanimously a proposition to give 25,000 francs for the construction of a &quot; Maison Rouge&quot; at Charleroi.Trade as Insurance against Propaganda.On his way to Moscow, M. Krassin told the editor of the Antwerp newspaper &quot; Neptune &quot; that he had given an order for 30,000 tons of steel rails, which he had been unable to place in Great Britain, to a Belgian syndicate, although he could have placed it more cheaply in Germany. He did this solely to show that commercial relations could be resumed. M. Krassin declared that on the day when an economic: treaty was signed with the Soviet all danger of propaganda disappeared. The danger was greater for nations having no official relations ratified by treaty, as Bolshevik propaganda was the only weapon enabling the weak to contend with the strong.Communism.By a police raid on the Communist headquarters a complete list Avas obtained of past and present members of the Communist movement in Belgium and subscribers to the &quot; Ouvrier Commuuiste,&quot; the official Bolshevik organ. No important meetings have taken place since the raid. Van Overstraeten is trying to bring about a special congress at Brussels attended by delegates from all Belgian branches. Should he be successful a police raid is probable.The group of &quot; Les Amis de l&apos;Exploite &quot; having failed to rind grace in the eyes of the workers, Jacquemotte is now seeking to organise a fresh anti-militarist movement through the &quot;Confederation Rationale des Jeunes Gardes Socialistes.&quot; Success is hardly likely, as the official Labour Party is aware of Jacquemotte&apos;s activities.
Relations with Russia.Count Sforza lias declared in the Senate in favour of an immediate economic agreement with tho Russian Mission, quoting British, example as a precedent. According to Vorovski, the main lines of the agreement have been discussed in London between M. Krassin and Signor Gianuini, and a Russo-Italian mixed commission will be appointed to settle final details. Vorovski admits that there is no question at present of resuming commercial relations on a pre-war basis. Russia is inviting Italy, as she invited England, to assist with her capital and her own labour to exploit, concessions, nearly all of them in South Russia. No timber concessions can be made, although certain districts in the Caucasus can be handed over to Italy for her to develop. Great tracts of fertile land in South Russia will be conceded for the exploitation of cereals ; the same applies to coal and iron districts in the Don basin. These concessions will be made on the understanding that a certain percentage of the output, to be decided upon later, will be exported to Italy. Guarantees will be political, and will not be based upon private contracts. In any case Italy will receive more favourable conditions than have been given to Great Britain. Russia will demand transport material, agricultural implements, and industrial machinery ; payment will be supplemented by gold. A project to establish a chamber of exchange in Milan is in the air.Through Kopp, Vorovski has complained to Moscow of his extremely difficult situation in Rome. He laments that ho is incredibly persecuted by the bourgeois press, and that no sooner are he and his fellow-workers recognised in the streets than they are insulted and annoyed in every possible way. He declares, in fact, that he will be compelled to leave Rome if the Soviet Government does not take the necessary steps to protect his person. Vorovski finds the spring of the trouble in M. Barrere, the French Ambassador, who, he alleges, stage-manages the attacks, and is doing all he can to make it impossible for the Soviet representatives to stay in Italy.Interviewed by a representative of the &quot;Journal,&quot; Vorovski was obliged reluctantly to confess that the time for complete Communism had not yet come. The Russian experiment had been made on too vast a scale. Asked why the Soviet wished to inflict on other countries the experiment under which Russia suffered, Vorovski replied that his inter-locutor was mixing up the Government of Moscow with the. Third International. The two things were absolutely different. The second was an institution absolutely political, which exercised its natural right to make propaganda.The War of Whites and Reds.Signs of dissension in the Socialist Party are becoming clearer, and attacks on the leaders are being made. The Communists, for their part, harried as they are by the Fascisti, declare that they do not renounce illegal action, and that fo the White Terror they will oppose a Com-munist Terror. The Fascist reaction has, however, so impressed the Socialist deputies that they have resorted en masse to Signor Giolitti, claiming Governmental protection.Meanwhile the columns of the Italian press which are not given over to electioneering news are largely occupied by the internecine war between Fascisti and Left Extremists. , The burning of &quot; Camere del Lavoro &quot; and of &quot; Case del Popolo &quot; in various towns seems to be a Fascist recreational-tion ; general strikes, riots, and bloodshed are accompanying disorders, witness recent events at, for instance, Venice, Leghorn, and Pisa.
Following the brutal murder of a young Fascist the Camere del Lavoro at Turin was sacked and burned. The Communists proclaimed in revenge a general strike, which was no more than sectional, and failed completely.Revolutionary Movements.The &quot; Corriere della Sera &quot; announces the discovery of a revolutionary plot. Premises occupied by Russians at Norvi and Pegli, on the Ligurian Riviera, have been raided, and evidence discovered of a Bolshevik con-ference held at Nervi before the recent anarchist outrages. A number of Russian revolutionaries have for some time been living on thoLigurian coast, ostensibly for their health, but really conducting subversive propa-ganda, and, it would appear, having relations with emissaries of Moscoav and with Bolsheviks in various Italian centres. The ramifications of their activities are now being traced.Twenty-three Communists, including the secretary and assistant secretary of the Syndicalist Labour organisation of Genoa, have been committed on charges of terrorist outrages committed at Genoa and on the Italian Riviera towards the end of March.The &quot; Giornale dTtalia &quot; is inclined to attribute present Anarchist attempts in part to Signor Nitti&apos;e weak policy towards Russian and Hungarian immigrants. The expulsion of most of these undesirables would mean an easier and quicker restoration of order.The *&apos; Fiat&quot; Lock-out.The lock-out at the Fiat works at Turin and the occupation of the factories by the military has, on the whole, been taken quietly by the 14,000 operatives concerned. The phrase &quot; general strike &quot; has not even been heard. The directors of the Fiat Company, as well as those of some smaller concerns involved, have determined to use this opportunity to restore discipline in the factories, and to rid themselves of the undesir-able Communist element. Indications are increasing that the lock-out is nearing an end. The Communist organisation is completely broken. Nine thousand of the workmen have asked to be accepted under the new conditions for return to work, including one that the firm shall be empowered to make war material of all sorts.Results of the Elections.The elections have come and gone, leaving the composition of the Chamber very much what it was. The returns, now practically complete, show that the new Chamber will consist of 382 Constitutionalists (in-cluding the Populars among the Constitutionalists), 121 Socialists and Republicans, 14 Communists, 6 Slavs, and 4 Germans. The predictions of heavy Socialist losses have not been realised, and it is not improbable that Fascist excesses caused some reaction in their favour. Actually the Socialists seem to have lost 16 seats, and the Communists three. The Socialist Leaders Turati and Treves, the secretary general of the General Federation of Labour, Daragona, and the leader of the Popular party, Meda, who was member for Milan, have been elected. Signor Giolitti professes himself not displeased at the result of the elections. He says that the industrial reorganisation of the country forms the most: im-portant part of his programme.The view of Voroski&apos;s delegation is given in a letter from Voroski&apos;s wife who says : &quot; We still go on sitting on our trunks awaiting events, &quot; that is the results of the elections in Italy, after which we can with a &quot; clear conscience, return to Russia, having done all we could to have &quot; peace with the Italians.&quot;
German Intrigues.The Germans are working quietly and steadily at recovering their old position in Italy. The country is flooded with German travellers and business men, who pursue an insidious campaign against England, praising Italian policy and pointing out that a levy on German credits means the dependence of Italy on England. The commercial classes are influenced by this propaganda, which has been strengthened by numerous notices from German firms that should the 50 per cent, levy become law iti Italy, prices of German goods will be increased by 50 per cent.Two German Majority Socialist delegates, Herren Dittman and Sussclbach (?), have been in Rome, in order, it is alleged, to promote a, formal protest against the sum fixed for war reparations. Dr. Sassenbach, who is called &quot; Social Attache&quot; at the German Embassy, has left Rome. Herr Dittman has an office at the German Consulate at Milan.Miscellaneous.May Day was uneventful except for a few conflicts between Fascisti and Communists, in which a number of persons were killed or wounded.Bela Kun&apos;s wife, her two children, and her sister have been expelled from Italy, together with other Hungarian refugees.D&apos;Annunzio1s former legionaries have again occupied Fiurae. They were summoned by Signor Giganti, the former Mayor, who has been proclaimed President of the Government.A decree has been issued dissolving the Communist Municipal Council of Bologna, which was the source of the outrages last November.Virgilio Broechi has been elected president of the Italian &quot; Clarte &quot; Group, which group has its provisional headquarters in Milan.SPAIN.The Internal Situation.Any successful attempt at revolution seems improbable, since no party has the organisation or the funds to undertake such a venture. The Communists, who are predominantly talkers and not men of action, have neither many followers nor any great influence. They are a minority, and differ fundamentally from the Syndicalist majority. Only a revolution could fuse the two parties. Syndicalist policy, as far as it exists, aims at getting more money and more power, to be used for the purpose of killing trade. Should a crash come, the Syndicalists would become, by a natural evolution, Communists, since the reason for Syndicates would have disappeared.It cannot be definitely asserted that conditions have improved at Barcelona, but the city is quieter and outrages have been fewer. An element of distrust in Anido and his methods of pacification is beginning to show itself, and there are signs that Parliamentary opposition will grow stronger. Auido&apos;s system has been purely destructive, and it is hard to find an answer to the assertion, which is true as far as appearances go, that the ruling classes are working only for the suppression of any combination whatsoever of labour. The time, however, has not yet arrived when severity can safely be relaxed. The murder of Senor Dato, for which Catalan anarchists were almost certainly mainly responsible, has strengthened the hands of the authorities, and has made the public impatient of talk of brutal repression. The so-called Sindicato Libre, which is a murder gang pure and simple, though it only kills assassins, is becoming a grave menace, not only to society in general, but also to
the stability of tho only really strong rule that barcelona has known for some time.   its suppression will be a difficult problem.unemployment in cataluua has been a useful weapon in the hands of the revolutionary bodies. tho labour crisis has unfortunately coincided with the suppression of the syndicates, which are now thoroughly disorganised. most of the leaders are under arrest, and practically every new committee is instantly raided, thanks to the talkativeness which there is reason to believe is enforced of prisoners. the workmen long for quiet, but they are driven to violence by certain leaders, and propaganda and terrorism are not dead. some funds would still appear to be coming in.the government have now agreed to submit all now measures regarding social unrest and. revolutionary movements to the juntas de defensa for approval. the juntas exercise at present great influence, as is witnessed by the permanence of anido in barcelona and the appointment of a soldier as governor of valencia. madrid politicians, who live in constant disquiet and suspicion of reprisals, would probably prefer a milder man in barcelona.Communism and Socialism.after a stormy nocturnal sitting, enlivened with blows with, sticks, fisticuffs, and a revolver shot, the national socialist congress at madrid rejected adherence to moscow by 8,808 votes to 6,025. after the following tumult had subsided solis announced that the partisans of moscow would secede from the party. most of the members of the executive committee also announced that they were leaving the party. spanish socialism is thus split, following the now universal practice.among the secessionists is the federation of asturias, composed chiefly of miners, very well organised, and probably the most powerful federation in spain. the federation was the chief support of the old party and of its daily paper, &quot; el socialista.&quot; its secession may be a decisive event. the extremists are expecting the fusion of the dissidents with the spanish communist party and with the catalan and other syndicalists.at a special congress the young socialists decided, by 3,026 votes to 440, to leave the old party for the third international, and to form themselves into a federation of communist youth. the madrid socialist party has, however, rejected a proposal to adhere to the moscow international, and has decided to support the projected new international.German Activities.the germans are showing a singular interest in revolutionary russians in spain. when the expulsion of these people is mooted a protest is almost invariably lodged by the german consulate, though the russian consul, who is usually something of a dead letter, makes no move at all. the latest german enterprise is a propagandist news-paper called the &quot; gazetade munich,&quot; half in german and half in spanish, and an offshoot of the &quot; miinchener neueste nachriohten.&quot; its circulation is largely gratis, with not unnatural success. meanwhile kneering, intimately connected with the banco transatlantico alemau, is said to be inquiring as to the possibility of floating a german government loan in spain. the bank in question has lately received 500,000 pesetas in gold, believed to have come from germany.hugo stinnes is reported to be stretching his tentacles to spain, where he is building giant paper mills.
Miscellaneous.John Arnall is thought to be again at his old game of gun-ruuniiig. He has recently visited Gibraltar and Spain, ostensibly on labour questions. He will, if possible, stand as a candidate at the next general election in England.PORTUGAL.A Plot frustrated.A conspiracy to overthrow the present Government and bring about the dissolution of Parliament had been arranged for March 23rd, but was given away by a marine, who, after pocketing the conspirators&apos; bribe, informed tlie Government. Royalists seem to have predominated in the plot, with a curious medley from other parties. The Royalists had at their disposal a good deal of money, which is said to have come from Jesuit circles in Spain. The Government contre-espionage would appear to have been effective.Miscellaneous.Anarchism, as far as it exists in Portugal, is a doctrinaire and academic rather than a practical movement. Its hotheads have sobered very remnrkably, and are now as mild as any sucking dove.The disposition of Portuguese school teachers is reported to be in general peaceful, though they are not particularly well or punctually paid. All teachers in Portugal, from University professors to elementary instructors, are civil servants, and are not inclined to subvert the Government.2. SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES.NORWAY. The Progress of Communism.Observation of Communism tends to show that the leaders of the movement in Norway are apparently becoming convinced that Communism is only a transitory expedient, which is bound to give way to anarchism sooner or later. It is noteworthy that 6 out of 13 names that recently appeared as those of the Moscow Central Executive Committee belong to men who are Anarchists or certainly were so in 1915.Communism is making somewhat ominous progress. The annual meeting of the Norwegian Labour Party, held between Good Friday and Easter Day, ended in a complete surface victory for the Extremists. 281 representatives out of 306 present voted for the majority proposal involving acceptance of the Moscow programme. Moscow has conceded one qualification. The Norwegian Labour Party has the right to main-tain its own organisation and to make reservations, collective and individual, with regard to the decisions of the Third International. A change of Dame to Norwegian Communist Party was not sanctioned ; the party will be called the Norwegian Labour Party section of the Third International. The minority group will apparently adhere to Moscow in principle and have no dealings with the new Social Democratic Party, which it regards as an enemy of the Labour movement. This new Party, the Right Wing of Socialism, does not in fact seem likely to command any serious influence. Moderate men have looked so far, in vain for some Government recognition of it as a refuge from Trades Union and Norwegian Labour Party tyranny and boycott. Failing a clear indication that its members will be protected against extremists, the party can hope for few recruits.
Altogether Communism in Norway would appear to be passing from under a cloud, and to hold for the moment the enthusiasm of the workers, oven of those who cannot readily bow to the tyranny of Moscow.The uncompromising attitude of the Employers&apos; Union in recent economic disputes has had much to do with tho change. Big wages reductions have been proposed or are contemplated. Thus the employers are proposing to cut the wages of seamen and stokers by 33^ per cent, at once, and by 25 per cent, further in the autumn if freights continue to fall. The workers urge that the fall in the cost of living is not com-parable with the wages reduction demanded. The Anglo-Russian Trade Agreement and the fall of Kronstadt have also impressed Norwegian labour with a belief in the future of Communism. The Norwegian Labour Party has meanwhile been ordered by Moscow to conduct an energetic campaign for the resumption of full formal relations between Norway and the Russian Soviet.The society known as &quot;Norway&apos;s Social Democratic Society of Youth &quot; was definitely captured by the extremists at the annual meeting towards the end of March, and re-baptised as &quot;Norway&apos;s Communistic Society of Youth.&quot; The proceedings displayed a neophytic revolutionary fervour, so eager as to be impressive. The society now numbers between 14,000 and 15,000 members about one-tenth of the whole of Norwegian organised labour, and it may count upon some 5,000 non-affiliated sympathisers. A thorough-going programme of propaganda and agita-tion was adopted. Germ cells, soldiers&apos; councils, children&apos;s groups, and a special national organisation.of corps of agitators are all to be formed. Special branches will deal with revolutionary propaganda, anti-religious propaganda, and sabotage in the workshops.The Norwegian Labour Party is reported to be negotiating with the Typographers&apos; Union, one of the most important Norwegian trade unions, which recently left the Labour Party for the new Social Democratic Party. Folkets Hus hopes that this union may be persuaded to return to the Communist fold.The Christiania Arbeidersamfundet, ostensibly a workmen&apos;s club only, is really controlled by the Norwegian Labour Party extremists, and a committee has been formed to direct its activities to Communism. Moderate members, who continue deaf to the Red evangel, will be discouraged from remaining members.The circulation of the Socialist press in Norway is reported to have grown from 8,000 in 1900 to 170,000 in 1921. Two Socialist dailies existed in 1900 ; there are now 14 daily and 24 other journals.Bolshevik Intrigues.Evidence is accumulating that the Russian Soviet believes that the Red dawn is breaking. The Christiania police have heard that orders have been issued to start disturbances throughout Scandinavia. The Norwegian Transport Workers&apos; Committee think of working up a strike on some local pretext ; the Labour Party received on April 3rd fresh instructions to prepare the ground unceasingly. The Scandinavian Com-munists are to be ready for a call, but the rank and file are not to know the real aims. It is further said that plans were laid at the Stockholm Easter Conference for starting industrial trouble throughout Europe.Information tends to show that Moscow is using Christiania as a clearing house for importaut news and information. News on Asiatic and East European &quot;affairs is received periodically at the press office of the Norwegian Labour Party direct from Moscow ; hence it finds its way to the Rosta Agency, Vienna, and thence to other centres.
Vardo is, however, the chief Bolshevik centre in Norway, Here the officially recognised Soviet Trade Agency has its headquarters, and hero it maintains a very large staff, including many propagandists and agitators. An engineer named Vilghus directs the agency, assisted by one Basb.ko.vsky, who, under the cloak of trade activity, superintends Communist agitation. Vilghus has the local newspaper &quot; Finnmarken &quot; completely at his disposal. All propaganda literature, funds, and agents enter Norway through Vardo, where the Bolsheviks are intimately in touch with local labour. The best organised of their groups is the &quot;Dockers&apos; Union&quot; of 180 picked Communists. A fisherman of Finnish origin, named Anti, sees to the transport of mails and to smuggling to and from Russia.Changes in Soviet personnel are reported. Moved apparently by discretion and a desire to capture moderate elements, Moscow wishes A. C Hanseu to don SchehVs mantle as chief agent in JSorway. SohehVs unquestioning submission to Trotsky has not suited moderate Labour, and it is felt that Hanson, though he is also somewhat of a Trotskyite, will not press for the fulfilment of Moscow&apos;s demands to the letter. Folkets Hus also believes that Moscow considers the change will be to the advantage of Soviet schemes in North Norway, since Hansen is less notorious than Scheflo, and his journeys north will excite less remark. Scheflo meanwhile goes to Moscow as the Norwegian Labour party&apos;s representative, and Tranmael succeeds him as editor of &quot; Social Demokraten.&quot; A provincial Right Socialist newspaper remarks in explanation that, now that the chief thing is to explain away the Moscow thesis, Scheflo is hardly the right man. He is a more com-petent journalist than Tranmael, but possesses a certain cynical code of honour.   Tranmael will be preferable for casting dust in people&apos;s eyes.On April 29th Tranmael himself is reported to have stated that he had had a request from Moscow to avoid trouble just now. The reason for this is that a probable trade agreement is now under consideration.The Norwegian Seamen&apos;s and Firemen&apos;s Union has issued a circular enjoining on its representatives to make every effort to prevent members of the Union from having any connection with the smuggling of Bolshevik literature by Norwegian ships.Trade with Russia.The draft of the proposed commercial treaty is now at Moscow, and an early settlement is expected. The Bolsheviks recognise generally their obligation to pay compensation for Norwegian properties which have been nationalised. Norwegian opinion does not favour trading with Russia. The press talks of the receiving of stolen goods, and indicates that Norway has scant opportunity of profit, as she has no greater chance of exporting fish to Russia.SWEDEN.Communism and Socialism.A movement is apparent, especially in the north of Sweden, among certain local sections of the former Social Democratic Left Party now the Communist Party to secede to the more moderate Minority Party.The secessionists have formulated a policy rejecting civil war and condemning dictatorship and the extreme centralisation of power. The new party calls itself the Swedish Socialist Left Party. The so-called &quot; Social Democratic Youth Clubs,&quot; hitherto under Communist influence, with a membership of about 49,000, also wish to join the Minority Party. The clubs raised a special protest against the clauses 0 AS 8841 B
in tho Communist Party programme regarding the arming of tho working classes. Their organ, &quot; Krihet,&quot; recently attacked Lenin&apos;s idea of bringing up the rising generation in communist doctrine.Certain other juvenile clubs, united under the title of &quot; Svenska Communistic Ungdomsforbundet,&quot; and embracing about 4,000 youths, are connected with the Left Socialist Party. The society is connected with Moscow and the Third International, and is believed to be affiliated to the &quot; International Communist Juvenile Movement.&quot;The &quot; Landsorganisation,&quot; a committee formed to regulate all matters concerned with Trades Unions throughout Sweden, may be regarded as the headquarters of the Social Democratic Party. The ex-Prime Minister, Branting, heads the Committee, which consists of Lindqvist, most of the Social Democratic members of parliament, and delegates of the different trades unions.The split among the Socialists caused the suspension of all May Day demonstrations. This is the first time since 1890 that no demonstration has taken place.  ,Bolshevik Propaganda.Admiral Dryssen has seized certain Bolshevik tracts distributed to the Swedish fleet. Kerjentseff has taken occasion to declare that the Com-missariat for Foreign Affairs possesses no propaganda a statement denounced by the Stockholm press, notably by Brauting&apos;s oigan, the &quot;Social Deinokraten,&quot; as grossly deceitful. Actually the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs has passed over its propaganda services to the Executive Committee of the Third International a state of affairs which permits Kerjentseff, as Soviet delegate, to negotiate with the Swedish banks while he preaches the subversion of Sweden.It was recently stated that a trunk load of Communist propaganda literature, printed in Russian, had been brought in by one of Kerjentseffs couriers and delivered to Kerjentseff after examination by the Customs. It appears that the literature in question was contained in the couriers trunk, which bore no seals, and that the courier stated that it was intended only for the information of the Soviet Delegation. The authorities, who had not been able to prevent the delivery of similar literature to Strom, were again unable to intervene. Kerjentseff replied very politely to a letter from the Minister of Foreign Affairs calling his attention to the terms under which he found himself at Stockholm. The situation in regard to Bolshevik literature is admittedly difficult, since the prevention of its importation would appear to be impossible without amending the Press Law, a fundamental Law of the Constitution, an amendment of which could not be passed in less that three years.Trade with Russia.Trade with the Bolsheviks languishes, partly owing to the distrust felt by Swedish business men, although Kerjentseffhas been arguing that Sweden is much better placed than England for trading with Russia.Some time ago the Bolsheviks signed an agreement with the Griinnar Andersson Syndicate, by which the Swedes engaged to deliver to the Bolsheviks materials (agricultural machinery, metal instruments, loco-motives, &amp;c.) to the amount of 100,000,000 kroner. The Bolsheviks engaged to pay 25,000,000 kroner in gold into the Nordisk Haiulels Bank (which they have already done), and to pay the remaining 75,000,000 in raw materials in the course of one and a half years. As the syndicate does not produce all the goods required, the Bolsheviks reserve the right to place orders for such goods with other firms, the syndicate guaranteeing payment from the raw materials to be received from Russia.   These raw
O^iAS 8841materials have not, however, arrived, and all the syndicate receives in answer to its demands is wait 18 months. As a result of a visit by G-unnar Andersson to Krassin in London the syndicate received another 10,000,000 kroner in gold, making 35,000,000 gold kroner cash in advance. When Lomonosoff arrived in Stockholm the syndicate asked, that he should refund the guarantees given to the other firms. Lomonosoff con-sented, on condition that the gold placed to his credit in Sweden should not be confiscated if the remaining 65,000,000 in raw materials were not delivered. The refunding of the guarantees is still being negotiated. The present position is that the syndicate has 35,000,000 kroner cash in advance, but has no guarantee that the remaining 65,000,000 kroner will ever be paid, or that the guarantees issued to firms, not members of the syndicate, will be refunded. The syndicate has exported to Russia goods to the value of 40,000,000 kroner.According to the newspaper &quot; Social-Demokraten&quot; a big Swedish concern has been floated by leading Stockholm banks to develop Russo-Swedish relations.   A share capital of 1,000,000,000 crowns is involved.M. Krassin has represented to Moscow that its negotiations with Swedish firms only disorganise the work of the Soviet representative in Sweden. In order to avoid misunderstandings Moscow is asked to leave all Scandinavian operations entirely to KerjentsefF in Stockholm, and to communicate through KerjentsefF on all questions concerning Sweden.Lomonosoff and Krassin.LomonosofF would appear not to co-operate smoothly with the other Soviet representatives, and to be somewhat independent in his attitude towards Moscow. He concealed his departure for Berlin. In Berlin Krassin and LomonosofF disagreed over the sale of gold, Krassin wishing that no more gold should be sold so that he might borrow on his reserve. LomouosofF appears toi have engaged his former assistant, Klodnitzky, in defiance of the orders of Moscow. Krassin is now reported to propose sending LomonosofF to Canada in order to attempt the starting of trade relations. He hopes thereby to move the American Government towards a trading agreement. Krassin himself proposes to go to Canada later.Dealings in Russian Gold.The value of the Bolshevist gold deposited in Swedish banks during 1920 is reported to be about 36,000,000/.Most of the Swedish banks are not above dealing in Russian gold. Even the Sveriges Riksbank, which, being a State bank, has hitherto refrained from such dealing, is now performing its first transaction of the kind. It is proposed to return, to Sweden the gold roubles which have found their way to the United States, to have them melted in the Swedish Government mint, and stamped with the Government stamp. The United States Government will accept gold so stamped without inquiring into its origin. So far, however, the Swedish mint has found no time to accept outside orders.Stinnes&apos; Activities.Much disquiet is felt at Hugo Stinnes activities. He has already acquired one of the biggest shipyards in Sweden at Landskrona, though the Government was asked to iutervene to protect the shipbuilding industry. Rumour now has it that Stinnes is buying up the Porjus Electrical SmeltiDg Works in North Sweden, near the Lapland iron ore fields.
It is reported that during March 5,000,000 tons of iron ore were shipped to Germany. These purchases were made on tho initiative of Hugo Stinnes, who has 50 ships engaged in transporting this ore. It is very probable that the Germans will use the ore for railway reconstruction work in Soviet Russia.DENMARK.Communism.Communist funds are reported to be low, and there is little hope of assistance from Russia unless Moscow is shown something for its money. After professions of poverty the Danish Syndicalists have obtained from Moscow an inadequate donation of 15,000 kroner, with instructions to get all trade unions to join the Syndicalist organisation, to agitate for the abolition of the army and a split in the Social Democrat Party, and to work as consistently as possible against Borgbjerg, the editor of Social Democraten.&quot;Kerjentseff, the Soviet representative in Stockholm, perturbed by recent Swedish legislation against Bolshevik propaganda, has asked the Danish Communists to undertake the organisation and distribution of such propaganda throughout Scandinavia.A Communist demonstration held to protest against the settlement of the question of a general strike, was thinly attended, and passed off very quietly.A Communist organisation, numbering so far about. 200 members, is reported to have been formed by the railway workers.Trade with Russia.It is alleged by Leverson, who is working in Berlin in connection with the Russian railway locomotive contracts, that Denmark is very eager to trade with Russia. Other reports allege that wide circles in Denmark would welcome a trade agreement with the Soviet. The; Socialists are curiously divided. While they advocate the resumption of ] trade with Russia, which is likely to enrich only individuals, their news-papers denounce the Bolsheviks as fomenting trouble. Scavenius is said to have quite changed his Russian politics, and to be offering Moscow every concession, even to the establishment of a Soviet legation in Copenhagen. Meanwhile it is announced that Danish representatives have gone to Stockholm to negotiate on trade questions with the Bolshevik Delegation there.A deputation from large Copenhagen firms dealing in electrical accessories has been in Berlin to beg from the Bolshevik delegatiou a share in Russian trade. They were told that it was most advantageous for Soviet Russia to buy in Germany, since Cierman goods were 40 per cent, cheaper than English goods, 60 per cent, cheaper than Danisli goods, and 70 per cent, cheaper than Swedish goods. The Danes asked whether there were any chance of recovering their deposits in the Russian banks. They were told that they would get them back some day the roubles at the rate of exchange on the day the banks were closed.3. CENTRAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.HOLLAND. Communist and Extremist Movements.It was admitted by the secretary at a private meeting of the Execiuitil Committee of the Dutch Communist Party in Amsterdam that on thl whole the party had lost ground during 1920.   The debate wliicJ
followed was marked by violent attacks on Wynkoop, the leader of the party, whose dictatorial manner and autocratic conduct appear to have offended many. In reply Wynkoop was truculent, declared that he would lead as he thought fit, until Moscow appointed someone else, and threatened to ask Moscow&apos;s sanction to expel Luteraan, the chief malcontent, from the party. His announcement that the Directorate of the Communist Party had decided to work with the &quot; Revolutionary Committee &quot; in spreading anti-British propaganda in Ireland and India met with a strong protest from Luteraan. Wynkoop gained his point, however, and it was decided to discuss the matter with the leaders of th^ Revolutionary Committee.It is reported that Luteraan has affirmed that G-orter, the Dutch Extreme Communist leader, co-operated in the preparations for the recent Communist outbreak in Germany. Luteraan maintains that the disturbances were not the work of agents provocateurs, but were prepared a long time ago by the German Communists.A society exists in Holland called the &quot; Society for Social-Anarchist Action in Holland.&quot; It has made an attempt at taking care of the unemployed, which has failed for lack of funds. There is no branch in the country of any international organisation of unemployed.S. van den Berg, Secretary of the Netherlands Federation of Trans-port Workers, has resigned and joined the Netherlands Union of Railway and Tramway Personnel, ostensibly because of a disagreement with his colleague Bouwman&apos;s Bolshevik tendencies. Bouwman would seem to be implicated in misappropriation of money belonging to the Federation, and van den Berg to have resigned in cousequence of Bouwman&apos;s retaining his position.The President and Secretary of the National Federation of Workers in the Furniture and Wood Industry have signed a manifesto calling upon all workers in these trades to refuse employment under the Nederlandsche Scheepsbouw Maatschappij, which they declare to be carrying out work refused by English Trade Unionists. The rival (Cabinetmakers1) Union, whose members are employed by the company in question, is abused, and its members called blacklegs.Trouble in the Peat District.The unrest in the peat district, which has resulted in large incendiary fires, would appear to be entirely due to labour unrest. It is local, and without connection with any general attempt at sabotage. The collapse of the demand for peat, following the artificial prosperity of the war, caused the employers to propose a reduction of wage. The employees, a not very intelligent class, resented this action, and fired the accumulated stores of peat with the object of increasing demand by destroying supply. The workers appear to favour Government arbitration. Their unions demand from 80 to 85 per cent, of the 1920 wages ; the employers are prepared to pay between 50 and 80 per cent, of the 1920 rates.Amsterdam and Moscow.ZinoviefTs insolent letter to the International Federation of Trade Unions at Amsterdam has drawn a sharp reply accusing the Moscow dictators of knowing nothing of the Trade Union movement, of having reduced the trade union organisation to a body under the orders of a political party, suppressed real trade unionism and organised in Russia la regime &quot; compared to which the white terror of the bourgeois &quot; Government of Hungary is only a pale reflection of your red terror.&quot; Zinoyieff is reminded that what he chooses to call the &quot; Yellow0 3
International &quot;has 24,000,000 adherents, and the Moscow organisation only 8,000,000, of whom 7,000,000 are Russians.GERMANY.The Recent Putsch.The tangle of intrigue behind the recent Communist disturbances does not grow clearer. Max Holz, the arrested leader, has been previously reported as an agent of the reactionaries. The impression gained is on the whole that the Communist movement has been weakened, and that the anti-Putsch clement, under Levi and the former leaders, will gain in influence. The fall of these leaders has confused the district organisation and has led in many districts to the resignation of their supporters. Meanwhile Paul Bottcher, the new secretary of the V.K.P.D., maintains that the party attitude towards National Bolshevism has undergone no change-any change would imply a surrender of prestige and credit. Bottcher does not believe tnat the Zentrale or the Executive entertains a new view of the problem, though there are tendencies within the Zentrale which cannot be concealed from the masses. Any compromise regarding National Bolshevism would be the end of the social revolution. Soviet Russia will only support a Soviet Germany.It would appear that a week before the rising took place it was being discussed among the Moscow Commissars. Moscow is said to have transmitted urgent orders for action, concluding &quot;no act.ion, no money.&quot; It seems to have been hoped that the Reichswehr would have been incapable of restoring order, and that Entente troops would have been called in, thus alienating opinion from the Government. The allied troops were themselves to have been soaked in Communistic ideals, and eventually turned against the Government and capital in general. The intention was manifested to reconstruct the former Red naval formations. Russian interned troops are being used as propaganda &quot; troops&quot; in factories ; they will be mobilised when the moment comes.It is reported that Loutovinoff, Secretary of the Russian Executive Committee of the Third International, has visited Berlin to discuss with the German Communists the situation created by the London Conference, and whether Germany would form a military agreement with Soviet Russia against Poland and the Entente. Stoecker told him, however, that the German Government was opposed to military ventures, and that the German Communists could offer the Soviet Government nothing but moral support. The United Communist Party has been alarmed by the arrest of leaders of the Central Office in Essen, and some influential leaders and members of the Red Army have fled to Holland. The V.K.P.D. leaders, indeed, have concluded that they will be compelled shortly to work secretly and illegally. In Essen attempts are being made to bring about a miners&apos; strike ; at Breslau the Communist centre is trying to establish closer contact with the Polish Communists.The Position of Paul Levi.The old dispute which caused the break up of the First International is now revealed as the real cause of Paul Levi&apos;s resignation of the chairmanship of the German Communist Party. Moscow&apos;s attitude to the Italian Socialists was, it will he remembered, given as the ostensible cause. AH turns on whether revolt must be left to the influence of economic causes or driven on by action from outside. In a brochure Levi accuses the new party leaders of attempting to spread the revolt
outside Saxony without regard to the situation in the rest of Germany. Levi writes that the German Communists represent only a fraction of German labour, a fraction not big enough to initiate big, mass action without specially favourable circumstances, which were not present in March. The &quot;Rote Fahne&quot; defends the revolt as having stirred German labour out of its stagnation. Meanwhile Moscow has definitely condemned the action of Levi and his fellow secessionists. His state-ments are construed as a deliberate attempt to break with the Communist International. Levi has accordingly been expelled by the Central Committee of the Communist Party, which is calling a new party conference.Communist Activities.A Nationalist Communist movement on the lines of that in Hamburg is being propagated in Bavaria by the K.A.P.D. members, Thomas and Graf. Thomas dreams of a combination with such reactionary organisations as the Orgesch, overthrowing the present Government and expelling the Entente. His nationalist aims win him the support of the Orgesch. Progress has been checked by the arrest of Thomas at Munich, but the idea has not been abandoned.Like its seniors, the Juvenile Communist Party of Germany is split into two sections, the Kommunistische Jugend and the Kommunistische Arbeiter Jugend. The K.A.J. issues the &quot; Rote Jugend&quot; as party newspaper. The K.J. is by far the more powerful group, and promoted an organisation, the &quot; Kinder Gruppen Bewegung.&quot;The expenses of Communist propaganda in Germany are reported to amount to 2,000,000 marks monthly.Communist propaganda is increasing among the unemployed, who are being urged to demand 100 per cent, increase of the doles and a bonus of 400-600 marks for bachelors and married men, as well as an amnesty for all political prisoners and those who have committed crimes in con-sequence of unemployment. However, despite the cloudy political situation, unemployment is declining. Unemployment allowances were issued to 417,000 persons in March as against 430,000 in February.Arrests of Communists.Max Holz, the Red general, was arrested in Berlin on April 16th. The police are now hunting for three trunks which were once in the possession of Holz, and which are known to contain the strong box of the Red Army, saved from the recent rout, and the complete archives of the German Revolutionary Party.Eight of the 11 men charged with the attempt to blow up the Victory Column in Berlin have been sentenced to varying terms of imprisonment; three were acquitted. The defence alleged that the affair was the work of an agent provocateur. So far 232 sentences have been passed upon Communists by tribunals of summary jurisdiction, including two death sentences and five of penal servitude for life.On April 19th seven prominent members of the executive of the V.K.P.D., including the President, Brandler, were arrested on charges of high treason. The reckless incendiarism of the &quot;Rote Fahne &quot; was, it is said, responsible for this decision. Brandler was once prominent in the revolutionary movement, but lay low during the last troubles. It has been discovered that his papers are forged and that he is in international law a citizen of Czecho-Slovakia. Not long ago the revolutionary activities of Stocker, second President of the German Communist Party, caused his expulsion from Czecho-Slovakia.   The
suggestion is now made that the Government will rid themselves of Brandler by putting him across the Czecho-Slovak border.The British Labour Troubles.Certain circles have been much interested in British labour troubles, and especially keen on knowing whether the railwaymen and transport workers would support tho minors. Persons named Mullor-Heymer and Heokscher went to Holland purposely to be in touch with the recent Social Democratic Labour Congress at Utrecht. They had separate interviews with Henderson, and more than one joint conversation with Ramsay McDonald and other British delegates. Heckscher is one of the pre-war tame German socialists subsidised by the late Herr Ballin ; ho is possibly now acting as an agent of the Heavy Industrials Stinnes, &amp;c.The Position of Kopp.A report, which should be received with caution, is again current that Kopp has been recalled. His position would appear to have been shaken by the personal reorganisation of the Berlin Delegation, which Stomaniakoff has undertaken. Kopp&apos;s connection with the recent Communist revolt seems also to have been questioned, On being severely taken to task by von Simons, Kopp retorted that it was Germany that needed Russia; he assured von Simons that he knew nothing of the preparations for the Putsch,He has, meanwhile, asked the Foreign Ministry to check at once the attacks made by the bourgeois press upon the Soviet Government and himself in connection with the rising.The Communist Party is demanding the immediate return of Reich to Russia. Reich demurs. He has stolen so much money that return means certaiu death.Relations with Russia.Zinovieff and Rykoff are reported to have left Moscow for Berlin on February 19th, evidently to complete the proposed agreement with Germany, which was signed on May 6th. In connection with the Ukraine the Soviet was apparently reluctant to accept the basis pre-scribed by Germany. Zinovieff, however, had been empowered by Rakovski to continue negotiations with Berlin.It will be remembered that since the Halle Congress, Zinovieff has been by no means persona grata in Germany, and that when he applied to go to Italy via Germany the authorities refused him even a transport visa. Zinovieff and Rykoff appear to have travelled as &quot; Sujeff&quot; and &quot;Kus-rezoff.&quot; A permit of entry appears to have been applied for from the German Charge d&apos;Affaires at Reval.It is reported that the German Government have allowed Stomaniakoff to buy a house in Berlin in order to open a special commercial department of the Soviet Legation. The Bolshevik engineer, Steinberg, is Stomania-kofFs personal adviser. Many German firms have informed Stomaniakoff that they will open a long credit to the Soviet Government with guarantees, provided the Government gives them certain industrial monopolies. Steinberg himself is working with Aschberg, with whom he has revived the &quot; Deutsche Oekonomie Gesellschaft&quot; under the title of the &quot;Svenska Ekonomiaktiebolaget&quot; of Berlin. This enterprise was originally started by Aschberg and the late Legien. It is a purely Bolshevik financial institution, carrying out secret financial transactions for the Soviet Government.
Negotiations, which have good prospects of success, are reported to be proceeding between the Ukrainian and German Governments with a view to the semi-official establishment of a representative of Soviet Ukraine in Berlin, holding a position similar to the Moscow representa-tive. One Schumsky, a Petrograd chemist, and Lewicki, leader of the East Galician Revolutionary Committee, are mentioned as possible representatives. The establishment of a Ukrainian telegraph agency under the name of &quot; Ukrosta&quot; will he one of the first duties of the Soviet Ukrainain representation.Stinnes&apos; Activities.The constantly ramifying activities of Hugo Stinnes and his autocratic attitude towards the whole of German industrial and economic life are reported to be causing much disquiet in Upper Silesian industrial circles. His hostility towards Simons, who is greatly admired in Upper Silesia, is deeply resented. It is said that should Stinnes not be able to subdue Upper Silesian industry to his will he would rather see the province allotted to Poland, thus freeing himself from disagreeable competition. Stinnes is taking over the &quot; East Prussian Machine Company&quot; in order to capture markets in the Baltic countries before British capital has been placed there. The German Foreign Trade Office is now said to be objecting to the participation of the Stinnes group in the Alpini Montan Company. The authorities think that it would be injurious to German interests to supply the 500,000 tons of coal needed annually by the company. Stinnes hopes to induce Cvseeho-Slovakia to deliver cheap coke to the company. As for Russia, Stinnes is not inclined to accept orders for material or work, though he is continually negotiating with the Bolsheviks. His only present business with Russia is the shipment of cargoes of goods at the sole risk of the Bolshevik Government. Other reports, however, mention negotiations of Stinnes with the Soviet Government for tho purchase of the Briauski Works at Ekaterinoslav, and the granting by Moscow of concessions for the Works. In Roumania Stinnes&apos; representatives are said to be studying local conditions. Rumour has it that Bratianu, brother of the ex-premier, and the leading figure in Roumanian economic enterprise, is not averse from co-operation with the Stinnes group.Stinnes is reported to control a well organised and well financed espionage service in Munich. It covers all middle Europe and deals in all kinds of anti-Communist propaganda. The service would appear to watch the disposition of armed forces.The re-election of Stinnes as a director of the Hamburg-Amerika Line has been refused on the ground that Stinnes, after being elected during the war to the board of directors, took the first opportunity after the war of starting a competitive service to South America without previously consulting the Hamburg-Amerika Line.Indian Intrigues.The agent sent from Moscow to Berlin early in March is reported to have asked for credentials to show that the Indian Society in Berlin really represented a big movement in India. He appears eventually to have been satisfied, and an interview took place between Kopp, Chattopadhaya, and others, in the course of which Chatto submitted various points for Moscow&apos;s consideration. These included financial help from Moscow to establish an Indian Revolutionary Society ifi Berlin on a sound basis; money for the publication of au Indian newspaper for circulation amongst Indians in Europe ; funds for the purchase of two printing presses for the publication of pamphlets,
proclamations, &amp;c, to be sent to India ; the placing at Chatto&apos;s disposal as propaganda agents for Indian nationalism of Russian Bolshevik agents in India, Persia, &amp;c. ; permission for Nationalists and other revolutionary elements in India to use Bolshevik couriers travelling between India and Berlin for communication with the Indian Revolutionary Society in Berlin; and financial help from Moscow to Indian students in Europe, and an opportunity for Indian students in India of learning practical work in engineering, &amp;c. in Russia. Kopp submitted these points by courier to Moscow. During the third week in March the agent previously mentioned sent information from Moscow that the Soviet could not help the Berlin Indian Committee because Roy had protested, saying that they were a set of bourgeois who had extracted money from Germany during the war and now wanted to do the same with Russia. As for Chatto&apos;s points, the Soviet wished Cbatto to visit Russia again for the purpose of discussing the matter further. Chatto returned to Berlin at the end of March, received Moscow&apos;s reply, and declared that he would not go alone to Russia, and that the deputation that he had arranged must accompany him this seems to have been dropped previously, presumably because of Roy&apos;s invervention. The Soviet agent was again in Berlin at the beginning of April, and interviewed Chatto and Dutt. Meanwhile, after consultation with Moscow, Kopp is said to have acceded to Chatto&apos;s request, and a party including Chatto, Bupedatta, II. L. Gupta, Khankhoji, and Agnes Smcdley is indicated as preparing to leave for Russia, Frau Grabisch, a notorious supporter of Sinn Fein and anti-British propaganda in Germany, may accompany the party in search of financial support for the new Irish magazine which she hopes to get published in Berlin. Colonel Emerson, the Irish-American Sinn Fein agitator, has asked Chatto to bid for Soviet support of all anti-British organisations in Germany. Chatto and Gupta are trying to obtain false passports from a number of Governments. The arrival of the party in Moscow is likely to see a pitched battle between Chatto and Roy, who is unpopular in Indian circles. He appears to have offered help from Russia to the Berlin Indians in return for their acceptance of Communist principles  an offer which Chatto and his party distrust, believing it to mean subordination to Roy. Some of the Berlin Indians have gone so far as to threaten to murder Roy for the sake of their country. H. L. Gupta, a potent influence in the party, has declared that if the others accept the Communist creed at Roy&apos;s behest, he will leave them and go to Spain to work independently.The Berlin Committee have little faith in the &quot;Provisional Govern-ment&quot; at Kabul, which is said to have promised the Punjab to the Amir in return for his support. The Russian Soviet Government has also heard of this agreement, which it considers a breach of faith. They have withdrawn their support and Mahendra Pratap and Barkatullah are said to be again in Moscow.Dost Mahammed, of the staff of the Mosque at Woking, is reported to be anxious to return to India through Constantinople. He will try to go via Germany if he cannot go via Milan. He has asked &quot; where Leipsic lay on the route &quot; a significant question in view of the fact that Leipsic University is the Moslem propaganda department of the German Government.Miscellaneous.Thirty Turkish Communists are reported to have passed through Munich on their way to Berlin, probably for instruction in agitation schools.
An International Federation of Unemployed is said to be in process of formation in Berlin. One Dr. Arnold Assmann and Buttler (Vivian Butler Burke) are reported to have arrived from Moscow to assist in its foundation.The Irish representative in Berlin appears to be one Hamilton possibly identical with Edwin Hamilton, an American agent who has been reported as being used as an agent by two American military attaches in Berlin, particularly in reference to the activities of the British Military Missiou there. This man was to help in smuggling to Berlin Dube and other revolutionary Indians in London.SWITZERLAND.Communist Activities.Although Swiss Communism still pays allegiance to the Soviet, it would appear that Germany is exploiting the activities cf Moscow in her own interests. Fresh elements, recruited from friends of Germany tried during the war, are said to have reinforced the Swiss Communist leaders, and German propaganda exerts itself parallel with the Communist agita-tion of Platten, Humbert-Droz, Schneider, &amp;c. The relations with Germany of such leaders as Belmont and Welti, of Basle, Brunner, of Geneva, Liffschitz, of Berne, Hochlenstein, of Biel, are not open to doubt.A number of Communists, of whom the most important is one Koussovatz, have been arrested by the Swiss police. They have been active Bolshevik propagandists.Writing to a friend in Geneva, one Bironkoff, employed in the &quot; Bureau de l&apos;Internationale Communiste&quot; in Moscow, asks the Com-munist Group of Geneva to do all they can for one Sali Bey, who is about to meet some Egyptiau Nationalists in Geneva on behalf of the Moscow Government. He will subsequently proceed to Egypt, well provided with funds to organise a Mahomedan revolutionary movement in North Africa.The Transport Workers&apos; Congress.Considerable resentment was shown at the Congress of the Inter-national Transport Workers&apos; Federation at the presence of J. T. Murphy, the prominent shop steward, who was there in the capacity of delegate of the International Trade Union Federation of Moscow. One British and one German delegate protested vigorously against Murphy&apos;s being heard, describing him as a Red agent and an undesirable person. It was decided not to hear Murphy, whereupon he attempted to make a speech which was shouted down by the members of the Congress. One indignant Austrian delegate hurled an orange at Lenin&apos;s emissary. As for business, a resolution was passed urging that an alliance should be secured with the workers of other trades, particularly with the miners, for &quot;the fight against reaction.&quot; The Congress approved the collective ownership of the means of transport.Miscellaneous.The Swiss Press Office for news from Ireland, which is established at Fribourg, is reported to be the continental centre of anti-British propa-ganda on Irish lines. It is directed by Professor Wolhausen, of the Fribourg College.
As conditions on which tho ox-Emperor Karl was allowed to return to Switzerland, the Government delegated to tho Federal Council the right to approve of his placo of residence, the Canton of Vaud, any-frontier town, and Borne being excluded as dwelling places. The ox-Emperor must warn the Federal Council 24 hours in advance if he wishes to leave Switzerland, and he and his suite must avoid all political activities.AUSTRIA.Extremist Movements.Communist agitation is failing to stir the universal torpor, anil the leaders are much disappointed at the scanty results achieved. In Vienna nervousness is apparent in Communist circles. The crisis in Russia has robbed the leaders of their confidence ; the loyalty of certain sections of the party is not above suspicion. So deep is the distrust that the leaders have advised great caution in admitting new members. Tho Hungarian Communists, probably the most trusted, arc being used in some degree to watch their comrades, and to keep an eye on counter-Bolshevik agitators and counter-revolutionary Russians.Agricultural labourers are now being indoctrinated with Communism, not without success. The mines at Halleim are a stroughold of the movement.The radical tendencies of the Soldiers&apos; and Workmchs Councils do not diminish. The Councils recently prevented the transfer of cartridges from the Hofstall Barracks to the Vienna arsenal. In the buildings of the Arbeiterrat at Halleim about 5,000 rifles aro hidden, evidently for emergency use by the salt workers.No close organisation for the unemployed, who are not numerous, exists in Austria. The &quot; Central Committee of the Unemployed,&quot; largely composed of Communists, is the only permanent institution ; it completely controls the movement. It professes to lead the unemployed, and at times stirs them to mass action. Communistic &quot; Councils of Unem-ployed&quot; also exist, and at the beginning of this year a special &quot;Fighting Fund for the Unemployed &quot; was created. No independent International organisation of unemployed seems to be contemplated, though the Com-munists see in the workless the most fitting iustrumeut of revolution. A kind of International Labour Exchange, purely social and philanthropic, is said to have been founded by a certain Professor Braun, in conjunction with Fiettores.Juvenile Communism.The Austrian section of the Communist &quot; Jugendverband &quot; held its third conference of delegates during March. The juvenile movement in Austria, according to Hexmanu, its head, has hitherto aimed at quality rather than quantity ; it now seeks to join forces with the masses and take over the command. The Communist youth will apparently not work directly through the juvenile organisations, but through revolu-tionising the trade unions. A sort of conference of presidents of foreign juvenile delegations was also held in Vienna during March. A proposal to found a central archive of the Communist Juvenile International was approved, as was the projected international course of instruction for the creation of a staff of skilled collaborators in the movement in Central Europe. One course has been held in Berlin; another, to last six months, is to be held this summer in Moscow. The juvenile move-merit in general is  active.   49 juvenile associations  have so far
joined the International; the total membership is more than 800,000. Propaganda is now being exerted among young country labourers, so far without conspicuous success.Over 200 scholars&apos; councils were represented at the first Congress of Scholars&apos; Councils held in Vienna during March. About 40,000 members of industrial schools were represented. The statute of organisation drafted by the Communist Party was adopted, and a manifesto to the proletarian youth of the world was composed. The Government is to be asked to recognise legally the scholars&apos; councils. A monthly paper called &quot; Der Lehrling &quot; has been launched.&quot;Anschluss&quot; and Karlism.Modelled on the sister organisation in Germany, a Republican League of Defence (Republikanisher Schutzbnnd) has been formed in Austria, with headquarters at Salzburg, with the Social Democrats as principal supporters, and Kitzinger, in Salzburg, and Seidol, in the Tyrol, as chief leaders. The league, ostensibly founded to fight the Monarchist move-ment, is slowly acquiring arms and ammunition, and is seeking to win over former officers of the Imperial army ; the conditions of membership are the profession of anti-Monarchist principles and submission to military discipline. The Communists do not control the league, which is, however, closely connected with Moscow and in touch with Bronsky.An active Pan-German propaganda continues in the province of Salzburg. The majority favour the union of the province with Bavaria, a solution opposed by the Pan-Germans on the ground that Germany needs the whole, not only a part, of Austria. The Christian Socialist attitude is vague. The Social Democrats support union with Germany as far as it agrees with their policy of centralisation. They have pro-posed to the pro-Germans that, in the case of a reactionary rising, the whole of the Wehrmacht should be sent from Vienna as reinforcements, since the Arbeiterwehr could control Vienna.The Karlist movement in Austria is propagandist only ; the money and energy expended bring no proportionate return, and no fresh recruits are won. The whole movement is so out of touch with present feeling that it can hope for no Avorking class support.Stinnes and the Alpini Montan.It is now settled that the Alpini Montan Company will be controlled iointly by Hugo Stinnes and the Italian group represented by Signor Castiglione. The F.I.A.T. will cede 200,000 shares of the Alpini Moutau Company at the price of 1,000 marks each to the Hugo Stinnes group, retaining the 50,000 shares acquired in 1919; Stiunes and Voegler, the Director-General of the &quot; Deutsch-Luxembourg,&quot; Avill form part of the managing board of the company. The coke for the mines will be procured from Germany instead of coming in uncertain supply from Czecho-Slovakia. Austria is likely to gain considerably, both by increased output and by freedom from dependence on the Czechs.The Turkish Nationalists.The Turkish Nationalist movement in Vienna is yet rudimentary. It Avas indicated some time ago that results unfavourable to Angora at the London Conference would lead the Vienua Nationalists to organise rapidly and to enter into close relations with the Communists in Austria and the Succession States. Nazim Bey appears to be the most pro-minent Turk, and any definite Pan-Islamic movement in Vieuna Avould probably centre round him.   Olher prominent Turks in Vienna are
Hassan Effencli, an ardent Nationalist and supporter of Kemal, Hassan Hilmi Pasha, late Grand Vizier, and Forad Nodzati, a keen Nationalist.Miscellaneous.Litvinoff is reported to have telegraphed on March 14th to the Communist International intimating that 100,000 reichmarks had been sent to Arthur Watts in aid of the organisation he was opening up in Austria.The doings of Reinat Svensou, a Danish business man of Oopen-hagen, would seem to require some explanation. His communications from Vienna resulted in LitvinofTs informing Moscow that it might send seven men to Vienna, since their arrival there was awaited and a motive for agitation prepared. Svenson had previously been in Vienna with instructions from the Third International for the Austrian Communists, and he has also served as an intermediary for litvinoff in trading matters. He travels as Danish courier, and is very useful to the Bolsheviks.Bronski has disclaimed any direct connection with Bolshevik Indian propaganda and activities. The Soviet representatives in Europe who deal with this subject and give instructions to Indians, are litvinoff and Kerjentseff.CZECHO-SLOVAKIA. The Decline of Communism.A report made to Moscow by Gillerson&apos;s Mission in Prague is a singular confession of the weakness and confusion prevalent among the Communists of Czecho-Slovakia. Since the last congress the Secretariat in Prague has shown no readiness or any working organisation, and has lived on its limited past force and reputation. No bulletins have been published or membership cards or receipt stamps seen to. At Louny the state of things is such that the proper working of the organising machinery cannot be guaranteed. Comrades who went to Prague for information heard such pessimistic views from Slatula, the local secretary, that they came away believing that the liquidation of Communism was preparing. Rumours, in fact, have spread that certain members of the executive were envisaging the formation of an independent Social Democratic Party, which would talk Communism but act after the wishes of the Government. These Opportunists did not favour voting concerning the joining of the Third International, which would be viewed by the Government as high treason, They considered that the fight that would follow the formation of a Communist party would be so Aveakening as to render practically impossible the formation of a big party. In order to prevent this the Opportunists mean to form a union of Social Democratic members in Parliament representing the trade unions. The report concludes that it has been decided to form an illegal organisation, which is already functioning and which will shortly be faced with action. The report affects to see the Magyar-Polish alliance and the Little Entente instigating a war against Russia, with Czecho-Slovakia playing the role of reserve with the great states of the Entente.In the opinion of the Mission the Government acted cleverly in arresting 3,000 people and releasing 2,500 of them, promising damages for wrongful arrest and so creating the belief not unfounded perhaps  that Communist activities are directed by irresponsible leaders, and that the masses suffer. &quot;It is no secret,&quot; declares the Mission, &quot;that the &quot; Government will be able to sentence certain comrades to 10 or more &quot; years of imprisonment, and nobody will move.&quot;
Relations with Russia.The attempts to bring about trade relations with Soviet Russia, which have so far failed, are to be revived on a large scale, and Czecho-Slovak consulates are to be established in Riga, Reval, and Tiflis. It is officially stated that the Czecho-Slovakian Foreign Ministry is organising agencies for trade. An exchange of trade missions has been agreed, and missions are being formed to go to Moscow and Kieff. M. Cech, a member of the Czecho-Slovak Trade Mission, has been conferring with Litvinoff at Reval.Conferences and Meetings.The Federation of Agricultural Labourers, Foresters, and Gardeners has lately held a congress attended by 500 delegates. The membership of the Federation stood at 257,864 in 1920. The congress ended in schism, part of the federation seceding to the Third International.It was announced at a conference of leaders of the Vienna branch of the Communist youth that a &quot; Committee of Action of the Revolutionary Youths&apos;Organisation of Czecho-Slovakia&quot; was to be formed. It has indited a manifesto to soldiers; indeed, a struggle against militarism teems to be its self-appointed task. Anti-militarism is said to have made some advance in Czecho-Slovakia, where the Socialist Czech legionaries have recently founded a special organisation.Most affiliated countries, notably France and Belgium, which originally started the confederation, were represented at the Congress of the International Confederation of Students at Prague. England has no properly organised union, and was admitted as a &quot; free&quot; (non-voting) member. The constitution of the Confederation was the main business before the Congress. There was lively quarrelling over the adoption of an English union to full membership, from which the Scotch, who have an old established union of their own, insist upon standing aloof, and over the admission of the Germans, which is opposed by the French and the Belgians. The Germans will probably be admitted at next year&apos;s conference at Warsaw.Miscellaneous.A movement, apparently fomented by the National German Socialist Party, is on foot against participation in enforcing the penalties against Germany.Magyar propaganda continues, in spite of the negotiations at Bruck. In the Ostrihon-Komarno district propaganda is being carried out by one Kurthy, an agitator instructed direct from Budapest.Sentence of one year&apos;s imprisonment has been passed on eight Communists of Kladno for incitements to revolt last December.HUNGARY.Agitation in the lost provinces would appear to be conducted by a sort, of small secret society, consisting chiefly of officers and the nobility. The task is considered dangerous, and the workers are chosen by lot. Two were recently caught by the Czecho-Slovaks and hanged.Prior to the recent expedition of Karl to Hungary, Pronay attempted to organise a three months&apos; military dictatorship, which would have overhauled the country and eliminated anti-reactionary elements. This project was exposed before it matured. A Carlist putsch, organised by Dani, the District Commander of Budapest, in co-operation with Savoly, the town commander, was also exposed and foiled.   These movements
are symptomatic of tho new political cries constantly raised in Hungary. The Irredentists are responsible for many. The &quot; Awakening Magyars &quot; Society is continually inciting its members to reaction and intense nationalism.Hugo Stinnes is said to bo negotiating for a controlling interest in tho &quot; Riraa Muranyi &quot; Iron Works. His agent is Count Fiierstenberg, the German Minister in Budapest, who is in close touch with the German Right Parties and who has considerable influence over the Hungarian press. Stinnes&apos; negotiations may have somo political significance in connection with the Irredentist movement in Hungary. Report has it that Stinnes will shortly complete the purchase of the &quot; Pesti Hirlap,&quot; the moderate reactionary Budapest newspaper, and of the clerical &quot; Uj Nemzedek.&quot;4. RUSSIA AND THE BORDER STATES. RUSSIA.The Economic Situation.Famine is spreading steadily, and now affects not only the towns, but great sections of the rural population. Thus in the Tula province nearly 800,000 peasants must be fed on imported grain. The quantity of seeds available for spring sowing is several million poods below requirements. In many areas the peasants, in order to restrict cultivation to their own needs, have not retained sufficient supplies. Cattle plague is raging in the Tamboff Government and peasants and cattle are dying in great numbers.Behind the hunger crisis stands the insurmountable fuel difficulty, aggravated by the continual closing of fresh railway lines. The Supreme Economic Council is reported to have decided that 160 factories should stop work on May 1st on accouut of lack of fuel. 45,000 workers in the metal industry alone will thus be thrown out of work. Work is apparently being carried on only in the most essential factories.The output of coal meanwhile falls in Russia generally and in the Donetz basin in particular. Every effort has been made to get machinery and materials to the Donetz. The human factor is, however, worn out and cannot be rebuilt. Not more than 17 per cent, of the pre-war number of workmen are at present in the Don basin, and most of these are underfed and underclothed. From mine after mine comes a lamentable record of flooding and of scanty output. The metallurgical industry is in almost as bad case. Generally speaking, Bolshevik experiments have destroyed the industry of the Donetz basin, and reconstruction must be a matter of years.M. Nolde, expert adviser to the Soviet for the textile industry, advises the denationalisation of the textile industries, a course to which the Soviet cannot yet resign itself. It is meanwhile announced that the - supply of fuel for the railways will be entrusted to individual enterprise.The currency problem is insoluble. The face value of paper roubles printed has increased from 2,000,000,000 to 4,000,000,000 daily. Even so the supply is insufficient because the peasants demand real money for their produce. The proposal made to introduce silver coins worth 10,000 paper roubles each has not yet been put into force. The latest quoted rate of exchange from Moscow gave 100,000 paper roubles to the pound sterling.
Social Conditions.There is no foundation for reports of a religious revival. A complete indifference to religion is manifest; many churches have been closed, and many priests have become Soviet employees.No lawyers are used for the administration of justice. It is hardly surprising to hear that the Soviet courts of justice and tribunals do not see in to need persons with judicial experience and education as judges.The alternative to non-employment in a Soviet department is starvation or mobilisation. There are now 764 Soviet Government employees to every 1,000 working men in Russia.On January 1st of this year there were in Russia 97,000 schools distributed over 54 Governments, attended by 6,420,000 children. The schools are divided into three groups the first or lower ; the second or middle ; and the third or higher and are run by Soviets in which the children themselves share, with the right to vote. Under this para-disical system no home-work is done, no examinations are held, and punishments have been abolished. The programme is ambitious ; the cleavage between home and school life grows.The Policy of Lenin.&quot; Dictatorship means something only when one class knows that it alone takes poAver into its hands Avithout deceiving either itself or others with talk of the sanctity of a Government elected by the entire people. The Avorking class maintains its poAver by the same methods as every dictatorship, ie., by firmness and relentlessness.&quot; Lenin to the Transport Workers.According to a Riga message to the &quot; Volya Rossii,&quot; Lenin offered to a recent meeting of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party the choice betAveen a radical change of policy or his resignation of the leadership. &quot; Communism in Russia,&quot; Lenin is reported to have said, &quot;is resultingjin the mere levelling down of everything. No creative &quot; constructive Avork is possible.&quot;Those in Moscoav who knoAv best incline to believe in the sincerity of Lenin&apos;s present orientation, Avhich is, however, only temporary, and dictated by expediency. No party is sincere as regards foreign con-cessions, which are regarded as a necessary but temporary evil.Noav, as before, the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party directs Soviet policy, and no permanent change will be permitted. The revenue from the new tax in kind is put at 240,000,000 poods for 1921 as against 430,000,000 in 1920, under the &quot; contribution&quot; system. The Bolsheviks contend accordingly that the new system allows the peasants a surplus of 190,000,000 poods for barter. A surplus is, however, very improbable, for the revenue obtained last year largely existed on paper. Furthermore, the lack of transport, seeds and other requisites renders it next to impossible for the peasants to increase their output. As has been indicated, the Bolsheviks will use their time of grace as a breathing space during which they will try to replenish their stocks by trade with Europe, improving their relations Avith the peasants and intensifying their propaganda abroad.Trotsky, Bukharin and Dzerjunsky are alleged to form a triumvirate actively working for the overthrow of Lenin. The three hold in their hands nearly the entire State machinery for an instantaneous coup cfetat at any time. Zinovieff would appear to be another of Lenin&apos;s opponents, and Litvinoff to be on Lenin&apos;s side. Krassin&apos;s visit to Moscow is umoured to be connected with these troubles.
The Peasants and the New Decrees.The peasants, wiser by many bitter deceptions, are reported to be indifferent to the new decrees. Explanations having the &quot; Welfare of Communism &quot; behind them, disquiet them, and they suspect that any increase of production will mean a reversion to the former system. The new trade regulations have caused lively attempts at smuggling food into Russia, with a view to disposing of it to the peasants. The emigrants from town to country now carry with them parts of machinery, &amp;c, from the factories, which they seek to exchange for food.Leuin&apos;s newly developed consideration for the peasants is exemplified by his instructions to use tact jn enforcing the sowing regulations. The general sowing scheme is to be modified in conformity with local conditions, and the peasants are not to be confronted with demands impossible of fulfilment owing to the lack of seeds. No measures formerly adopted in carrying out the food levy should be resorted to during the collection of the tax in kind.As against these injunctions to leniency, scales of the new tax show that 45 lbs. of bread per head per month may be retained and the remainder must go to the State. From each cow or bull 17 lbs. of meat must be delivered. The required weight of animals is taken irrespective of whether the animals are slaughtered or not. If a peasant owns 20 cows, an animal weighing 340 lbs. is taken from him. In certain cases the Commissars have insisted upon tho hinder portion of a cow as State property, so that the peasant has had to feed the cow, while the Commissar received the milk. 20 eggs per hen and 10 eggs per duck or goose monthly have to be delivered. Fruit and vegetable gardens are entirely at the State&apos;s disposal, and peasants who have no gardens must deliver 10 lbs. of marsh or forest berries monthly. It is hardly surprising that in certain cases the authorities have had to use force to obtain the various contributions.The Position of the Co-operatives.Moscow&apos;s new scheme for co-operation does not relax the Soviet grip on the movement, which is made a strictly State institution. All citizens of a town, factory, or village are obliged to become members of one co-operative society, and even the largest cities cannot have more than one co-operative organisation. Territorial and vocational unions are, however, permissible within the one big organisation, and consider-able freedom of trade is granted to the Co-operatives. The new Co-operatives have a double task to be an instrument to exchange with the peasants articles of industry for agricultural produce, and to dis-tribute the food and other commodities gathered in the country or imported by the Government. The Food Department will collect only the food tax. The Centrosoyus remains the Central Executive Com-mittee of Co-operatives. The Co-operatives elect the members of the Centrosoyus, but the Ail-Russian Central Executive Committee of Soviets will delegate its own representatives to the local committees of co-operative organisations. Free trade is permitted locally when the population has paid its quota in rural products in lieu of taxes. The buying of rural products by individual citizens for the object of trade is forbidden. No trade is permitted if the seller cannot produce a receipt proving payment of the tax.Another decree removes previous restrictions as to the extent of wages obtainable by superior pieceworkers, and authorises-a fresh indication of the collapse of Communism a more visible connection between wage and production.   The trade unions are to prepare within
a month a uniform scalo for all categories of labour in. different branches of industry.The Soviet is rumoured to be preparing a decree for the denationali-sation of real estate in the Russian towns. The decree restores to its former owners all property valued before the war at 7,5007, or less; Thus the reaction against Communism continues.Foreign Trade.The truth comes out. &quot;When we have got everything from Europe &quot; we shall turn our weapons against it, and then woe betide it and its &quot; capitalistic social system &quot;-Kalinin, President of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee.Preobraschenski, the adviser of the Soviet in matters of currency, is reported to have stated that the Government means to lose no opportunity of &quot; watering down &quot; foreign currencies. He boasted that Russian experts had succeeded in completely counterfeiting many foreign currencies. Besides the importance of deteriorating the monetary systems of &quot;bourgeois&quot; countries, there was also the advantage of supplying in this matter Communist groups abroad with the funds they needed. Preobraschenski&apos; did not commit himself to saying that the Soviet itself was counterfeiting foreign currency ; the inference is, however, obvious. The Soviet mission in Berlin now possesses very large sums of new German paper currency ; Russian agents and missions in Scandinavia have lately paid out great numbers of new English 11. notes ; and most Soviet couriers are usually provided with new paper currency.It is reported that no agreement has yet been reached with the Standard Oil Company in the matter of concessions at. Baku. The Soviet would appear, however, to look favourably upon the proposals, as they cannot work the wells themselves. Moscow considers, that the matter will cause friction between England aitd America. The Nobel Brothers, of Sweden, are said to have sold to America a large amount of their shares in the Baku naphtha factories. They failed to sell to England and France.The reserve of platinum is said not to have, been touched ; on the other hand, there is evidence that it is being exported in small quantities to Sweden, where it is quoted at 10,000 kroner, per kilogram. Local Americans take some interest in the export of platinum, and one firm is prepared to purchase up to 20 kilograms monthly until further notice.It is reported that the following sums have been spent in Russian gold : 100,000,000 gold roubles for the different countries which have broken away from Russia; 150,000,000 gold roubles in connection with the Swedish orders ; 200,000,000 gold roubles assigned to Lomonosoff for goods bought in Germany ; 50,000,000 gold roubles spent by Krassin and Kopp. There is also the gold given to Germany according-to-the Brest-Litovsk treaty.v Krupps are said to be considering the reorganisation of the Putilov Works and of the Ohtensky Powder Factory. The Soviet has given them permission to import the necessary machinery, &amp;c, and its installa-tion is being prepared.Statistics.of imports into Russia since the beginning of 1921, published by the. Soviet, show that the United States heads the list with 1,176,000 poods of goods ; Great Britain is fourth with 121,047 poods. The total importation is 2,038,954 poods. Exports during the same period amounted to .189,000 poods rather more than 10 per cent, of the imports.O AS 8841 &quot;
Tcbitcherin has informed the British Government of the &quot;firm resolve &quot; of the Soviet to execute strictly all engagements entered into by agreement. In regard to Sir Robert Home&apos;s note he states that a &quot; special study &quot; is being made of the questions raised, and the results will shortly be made known. Bronski, the Soviet emissary in Vienna, has admitted that only compelling circumstances brought about the trade agreement. He added that the treaty would not slacken the activities of Russia,, which would always be ready to render help in any form the Indians might require to free themselves from the British yoke.The Soviet Government is reported to have intimated to M. Krassin that they intend to recall him and replace him by Platon Kerjeutseff. M. Krassin is remonstrating. Kerjeutseff is not one of the most widely known, but he is one of the ablest and most dangerous of the Bolsheviks. He is the real chief of the Rosta Bureau ; he has been practically in full charge of all pro-Bolshevik anti-British operations to be carried out by the Soviet Government in India and the Near East. He is a strong sympathiser with Sinn Fein, and has published pamphlets called &quot; The Irish Revolution &quot; and &quot; Irish History.&quot; There is, i udeed, an unconfirmed rumour that he took part in the Easter rebellion of 1916.M. Krassin&apos;s main objects in revisiting Russia are said to be to establish a firm control of all expenditure through the Delegation in London ; to seize Lomonosoffs power and that of other agents in Europe, and to concentrate all their activities under his (Krassin&apos;s) supervision ; and to prepare the Soviet Government for the recognition of private properties belonging to British subjects. M. Krassin is doubtful of success in his last aim, since so marked a recession from Communism would place the Soviet Government in danger of overthrow. Mr. Peters, of the Department of Overseas Trade, and Mr. Jerram, British ex-Consul in Novorossisk, have accompanied M. Krassin. Mr. Peters is instructed to return quickly to report on the general situation.M. Krassin is reported to have called upon Berkenheim, now that relations between England and Russia are more normal, to give up the Centrosoyus funds, amounting to 100,000?., which are in his possession. Krassin hopes for a voluntary surrender of the funds and the consequent avoidance of a lawsuit, which he would otherwise be compelled to bring. It is, however, very unlikely that Berkenheim will accede to Krassin&apos;s demand.M. Krassin has also proposed to Mr. Leslie TJrquhart to restore to him 1,000,000/. in gold in England and to undertake the expense of refitting his factories on condition that he re-starts them. It does not, however, follow that this lies within M. Krassin&apos;s power. The ulterior motive may foe to influence the American Government to conclude a trading agreement, since M. Krassin knows that Mr. Hoover was Mr. Urquhart&apos;s partner.An official of Krupps, writing to England, notes that Messrs. Tickers are disinclined to move just at present on account of their internal affairs and of the political situation. The writer agrees that the present moment is most unsuitable for starting any negotiations with British firms. Such negotiations . should be postponed &quot; until a certain settlement has taken place politically.&quot;. The order for 600 locomotives is now in the hands of the locomotive builders, and it would complicate matters seriously if fresh negotiations had to be carried on with a view to let the order go through the other channel.In connection with the Vickers-Krnpp scheme for the repair of locomotives in Russia, M. Krassin has explained that he is unable to
give official support. He has suggested the placing, through British channels, of the big orders in Germany, amounting to about 200,000,000 gold roubles an idea opposed before the trade agreement was signed, but now apparently favoured as an Anglo-German measure of protection against France. Krupps and the German banks have been informed, however, that the British banks will not buy the Eussian gold if the proceeds are to go abroad.   This has also been impressed&apos;on M. Krassin.The British Treasury solicitor has been instructed to consider as legal Russian currency Imperial and Duma (or Kerensky) roubles. Soviet roubles are not so considered.Relations with Angora.Karakhan is reported to have told the German Foreign Office that Angora urges the German Government to help it by supplying ammu-nition, arms, aud especially cartridges. Failing this help, Mustapha&apos;s movement will collapse within the next two months. The Soviet Government has already done all that it can. Karakhan has furthermore assured the German Government that the Soviets undertaking to abstain from anti-British propaganda in the East means nothing. A secret agreement with Angora provides that the entire anti-British propaganda in the East is now entrusted to the Kemaiists, who must conduct such propaganda and agitation according to the instructions of the Third International. The military representation of the Angora Government is proceeding to Berlin via Moscow to invoke the aid of the German Government.The Vanderlip Concessions.It is alleged that before he left America Vanderlip obtained from Mr. Harding&apos;s secretary a paper signed by Mr. Harding and recommending him in general terms to the Soviet authorities. The secretary drafted the letter uuder Vanderlip&apos;s instructions ; it was signed by Mr. Harding before he became president, without, it is thought, his looking at it. This fact is now being exploited in Moscow. The big interests behind him render Vanderlip hopeful of big results. The concessions in Kamchatka are, meanwhile, reported to have been signed. Probably for political reasons, rumour in Moscow has it that the concessions are more of the nature of an &quot; annexation.&quot; Meanwhile, Krassin seems to be dubious, and has warned Moscow that Vanderlip lacks authority and is only a very second-rate American commercial man. Vanderlip has apparently been urging people in Moscow to undertake export trans-actions for one milliard in gold. As against this, Krassin recommends great caution, saying that the man is trying to fish iu troubled waters. He dismisses the talk of one milliard in gold with the remark that &quot; all advertisement is good, but only when it is plausible.&quot; Vanderlip&apos;s status is reliably reported to be the same as that of any other foreigner who might contemplate doing business with Soviet Russia. He may trade, but he does so at his own risk.The Red Army.Thanks to Trotsky the military machine is the only one, except that of the Extraordinary Committee, which is working efficiently in Russia. The general tendency in the Army is reported not to be Bolshevik; soldiers and officers are mercenaries, ever ready to fight, and even dreaming of new conquests. They Would fight well in a purely pre-datory war. Most of the old Tsarist officers are employed on various staffs.Moscow declares &quot;impracticable and dangerous at the present moment &quot; the disbandment of the present Red Army and the immediateD2
transition to the -militia system., For the immediate future the foundation of Russians armed forces must be the present Red Army, reduced by the demobilisation of the older men, and retaining its proletarian and communist composition. The militia system can be partially adopted &quot; only in those districts where proletarian unity reigns among tho population (i.e., Petrograd, Moscow, the Urals).&quot;The Soviet is said to be making special efforts to develop the strength and fighting value of the Third International Army, which will, as far as possible, be organised by nationalities. Foreign Communists of military age will be enrolled in this force.It is reported that the Red Army cavalry is being brought up to four divisions. One division is being formed at Orel. Another cavalry division, consisting mainly,of Bolsheviks, is being sent from Kharkov to South-West Ukraine.There are said to be some 7,000 Chinese troops in Russia, exclusive of those in Siberia and in the army of the Third International. Lui Veu, who was educated at the Pavlov Military School, commands all the Chinese troops and leads the Chinese Party in Russia.According to a Helsingfors newspaper, Trotsky nas stated that the War Academy at Petrograd will, in the summer, examine the possibilities of a campaign in the east and a war of revenge against the Poles.The internal disorders have caused no relaxation of Bolshevik preparations against Roumania; in fact, the forces on the Roumanian frontier are&apos; being increased. Propagandists are also being employed among the peasants, if possible to organise peasant revolts. Kishiniew is mentioned as the probable centre of this propaganda.Dzerzhinsky has been appointed Commissary, of Communications, retaining his other functions. The maintenance of communications in and with Siberia is one of the chief present preoccupations of the Soviet.Anti-Soviet Risings.The failure of the Kronstadt rising has filled the urban population with bitter disappointment and a feeling of increased helplessness ; with mistrust and hostility towards the Entente for having failed to support the movement, and towards Great Britain in particular for having signed the trade agreement at a moment when hopes of overthrowing the Soviet were high. The feeling that they have pursued selfish aims has discredited the anti-Bolshevik organisations abroad. It is generally held that the present Government will disappear, either when the ruin of the country is complete, or when a general rising succeeds by its dimensions. The suppression of the Kronstadt rising is generally credited to the army of the Third International, which thus saw its first active service against the Russian people. A more friendly feeling towards Germany, fostered by the Stinnes group, is apparent. On the whole an impression is left of widespread dissatisfaction, and of unrelia-bility in the Red Army, counterbalanced by the reliability, of the Third International Army. The intelligentsia had no share in the recent risings, partly from lack of faith in their success, partly from lack of arms, organisation, and definite aims.The reluctance of the Cossacks to suppress risings in some cases they have refused to act at all is perturbing the Soviet, which has despatched to them its most trusty agitators. Counter-revolutionary leanings have brought about the dissolution of the Cossack section in the Ail-Russian Central Executive Committee.The Soviet remains apprehensive at the growth of the Antonoff insurrectionary movement, which now covers a vast area south and
south-east of Moscow, from Kursk and Kharkov in the west to Samara in the east, and increasingly threatens Soviet power. The rebels aim at securing the mastery of the chief corn-producing governments of South Russia, and at cutting communications between Moscow and : the Caucasus.Maliuovsky, who calls himself representative of semenoff&apos;s Far Eastern Government, has arrived in Kovno, intending to form a White russian anti-Bolshevik army. According to Malinovsky, Semenoff stands for constitutional monarchy and intends to support the Border States after the re-establisbmeut of order in Russia. White Russia is chosen as the most suitable base for operations.The execution of prisoners taken in Kronstadt was reported to be continuing as late as the middle of April, 50 to 80 men and women being shot daily. One night there was a massacre of 370 victims at Tsarskoe Selo, The tumbrils of the French Revolution have been replaced by motor lorries. When the drivers, sick at the endless murders, protested, they were replaced by women drivers, one of whom is the daughter of a well-known Tsarist general.Movements in the Ukraine.The All-Ukrainian National Council, at a congress in Vienna, is reported to have resolved that Petlura&apos;s treaty with the Poles be declared null and void ; that an endeavour be made to create a great Ukrainian State on a federal basis ; that negotiations be entered into with Moscow, recognition of the complete independence of the Ukraine being a preliminary condition : that energetic action be taken against Polish imperialism, and the evacuation of Eastern Galicia and the western portions of the Ukraine be secured; that relations with Germany be regulated via Moscow, and close relations between Germany, Russia, and the Ukraine maintained. Another and less credible report has it that the meeting resulted in a scheme for a possible advance of Poland, Roumania, and France against Soviet Russia, France recognising the independence of Eastern Galicia and the Ukraine.Communism and Propaganda.Bolshevik propaganda activities have been greatly confused by the arrests of Communists in France, Germany, and other Western European countries. Little importance is attached to arrests in Finland. Special agitation intelligence agents and agents of the Extraordinary Committee are being sent to countries with which Russia has signed or is about to sign peace.The-People&apos;s Commissariat of Education has organised a special training college for &quot; Red &quot; professors. Students wishing to attend the college must pass a special examination in theoretical economics, historical materialism, and history.The Bolsheviks have founded a technical bureau in&apos;Berlin, which issues propaganda directed to persuading intellectuals to return to Russia. One Professor Stcherbatzkoi has been sent to Sweden on a similar mission of reconciliation.On April 13th Litvinoff telegraphed to Bukharin, &quot; From Vienna five &apos; agitators sent to Germ Cell No. 30 in Ireland,&quot; and &quot; April 21st expect &quot; result activities Germ Cell No. 30 in Ireland as per instructions given to &quot; Krassin,&quot; ...Enver Pasha is reported to have arrived in Moscow and to be negotiating Avith ;the Soviet Government on methods of continuing anti-British pro-paganda in Afghanistan and Central Asia.
Boltinsum (alias Pavlovitch) is the chief for Soviet propaganda in the East.   Erivan, Baku, and Derbent are the propaganda centres.Jews and the Soviet.The Jewish Bund, or tho Jewish Socialist Workmeu&apos;s Party, has amalgamated with the Russian Communist Party. Its central committee is to consist of 15 members. The majority will serve in Russia ; the rest will be sent abroad. A special commission is to be sent to the United States, independent of the central committee, but in close touch with it. Two chief propaganda bureaux are to be organised in Europe and the United States, and a vigorous propaganda conducted. It is claimed that the party has made great progress of late, notably in Germany and Poland. In Poland 50 per cent, of the working-class Jews are members. The Soviet has greatly helped the Bund during the past two years.The minority left wing of &quot; Poale Zion &quot; in England is reported to have informed the branches abroad that the party has decided to adhere to the Third International.Miscellaneous.Menshevik influence in European Russia and Siberia is reported to be growing. In certain Governments the Mensheviks are in contact with the peasauts, whom they strengthen in their hostility to the Soviet.M. N. Roy is said to have been summoned from Tashkent to Moscow and reprimanded for making a speech against the Amir. The speech lost Roy much of his influence in Tashkent.The Marine Section of the Ail-Russian Union of Transport Workers, in conjunction with extremists outside Russia, has issued a violently worded appeal to a conference to be held in Petrograd during the second week in August with the object of creating a Red International Federation of Marine Transport Workers.The All-Russian Checka at Moscow recently issued an order to arrest and examine all persons entering the Esthonian or Latvian Missions, and to take steps that they did not disclose the object for their arrest under heavy penalties.The publicity given by the press to the large and luxurious dinner given, recently in London by the Soviet Delegation in commemoration of the conclusion of the trade agreement between Great, Britain and Russia has provoked Moscow to the issue of a circular to all the representatives of the Soviet and the Commissariat for Foreign, Affairs abroad. The circular commands the Soviet representatives to prove by their mode of life that the Soviet Government is really a workers&apos; and peasants&apos; government. A Spartan mode of life is an indispensable condition for all the foreign representatives of the Soviet Republic and its various institutions.Trotsky and Budenny are reported to have left Moscow for the Afghan frontier.   The object of their journey is kept secret.FINLAND.Relations with Russia.&quot; Normal &quot; relations between Helsingfors and Moscow develop slowly. Sufficient progress has, however^ been made in regard to the repatriation of Finns in Russia to render it possible for the Finnish Government to permit the return of the Russian trade delegation, which will; continue negotiations for opening trade^ relations, and to allow the trade. delegar tion&apos;s technical personnel to come to Finland,
Tchifccherin is reported to have made an aggressive reply to the Finnish Government&apos;s note on the Bolshevik encroachments in llepolo and Porajajris. He asks whether Finland intends to adhere to the terms of the Peace Treaty. The Finnish reply note is reported to confine itself practically to the question of Eastern Karelia. It denies that Finland supported any conspiracy in Karelia, declares that the sole policy of the government has been to secure the execution of the provisions of the Peace Treaty relating to the districts of Repola and bterajueris, which provisions have been violated by Russia, and insists on the willingness of Finland to observe the Peace Treaty if Russia also observes it. The- immediate appointment&apos; of a mixed committee for the settlement of disputed points is urged.Growth of German Influence.German influence is markedly increasing, and the press is again developing a pro-German tone. A. special anti-British effort is manifest. German machinations have noticeably altered the attitude of Finnish officials and local Russians since the failure of the Kronstadt rising and the signing of the Anglo-Russian agreement. New German agencies have been established-- one by Hugo Stinnes in the firms of Biehl and&apos; Fehling.Miscellaneous.The. meeting and procession proposed by the Communists for May 1st were forbidden, as the Finnish Socialist Labour Party is not a registered Society, and the supreme Court has pronounced its activities to be &apos; criminal.The assistant of Behrsin principally charged with agitation in Finland is reported to be Tcherniak, who has for assistant Haase, a. former captain in the German Army and 2nd Adjutant of von der Goltz. Behrsin&apos;s personal secretary is Hoffman.An unsuccessful attempt by Bermondt to reach Finland is reported. At Copenhagen he was refused permission to proceed with his journey and had to return to Stettin.The new Government has published its proposal for an extension of the amnesty. It prescribes the conditional liberation of those rebels serving sentences of eight years or less Avho are still imprisoned,,and the . full pardon of those sentenced to &quot; conditional &quot; punishment,.and of those conditionally liberated after serving part of their sentences. The persons, now to be released were excluded from last year&apos;s amnesty, and there is little doubt that they are less dangerous than some previously liberated.Baltic States. ESTHONIA.Internal Affairs.The&apos; economic situation does not improve. The Esthonian mark is falling ; trade is stagnant, and various factors encourage unemployment. The Government and its officials lack financial and economic experience ; the banks work for tlieir own ends and do not help the Government and1 the low salaries lead to corruption.The Government is obliged&apos;to&apos;walk delicately in its relations with tlie BolslievikSj whose&apos;tone has latterly become much more acerb. Esthonian feeling towards the Soviet has not changed, but the authorities are forced&apos; &apos; to&apos;remember that Russian gold and transit trade are valuable assets, that their truculent neighbour is&apos; powerful and that help from outside is problematical1 in the event&apos; of trouble.   The Government has had to
apologise for the removal of the Soviet flag from the Hotel Petrograd ; the press has been obliged to change its tone ; and official circles are reticent in discussing Russian affairs. During the Kronstadt disturbances Litvinoff complained that White organisations in Esthonia were preparing to assist the insurgents. He threatened that Russia would regard very, seriously any attempt at a reconstruction of the North-West Army. The Minister of Foreign,: Affairs denied any knowledge of the affair, but promised to take action on necessary.proof. Ivanov and other members of the &quot; Provisional Government of North Russia &quot; have recently been arrested and their houses searched.     - , &apos;.-Apparently as a means of dealing with Bolshevik agitators, the Government has proclaimed the centre and east of Esthonia as a military zone, exempting the Hapsaal and Peruau areas on the west coast. Esthonian and Russian undesirables will be obliged to leave the military areas within 15 days. If they cannot obtain visas for another country they will be allowed to go to the non-military areas. Accommodation in Esthonia is doubtful, and the most undesirable elements will, if possible, be segregated on the Runo and Kyno Islands in the Gulf of Riga. Some of the persons segregated are Russians alleged to have been concerned in a plot to form a &quot; White &quot; Government on Esthonian territory during the Kronstadt rebellion, and to embroil Esthonia with Soviet Russia.The Communist Movement.Notable Communist successes have been registered in Reval, the only town in which the Extremists are really strong. Kingisepp, who is hiding in Reval, directs thein. At the recent municipal elections they won many seats, almost wiping out the two other socialist parties. Since then the Independent Socialist Party has fused with the Communists, declining however,&apos; to join the Third International. The authorities have been moved to action, and have arrested a number of Communist members of the Town Council and carried out domiciliary visits at houses of Communist deputies and other members of the party. Many documents are said to have been found revealing Bolshevik propaganda and schemes for bringing about a revolution.The Social Revolutionaries.Social Revolutionary-activities are reported to have increased greatly since the arrival of Chernov from Paris with 4,000,000 Tsar roubles. The Social Revolutionaries are printing propaganda liteiature and sending it, together, with agitators, into Russia. Litvinoff is working hard against them and has persuaded the Esthonian authorities to suppress the Social Revolutionary newspaper &quot; Narodnoe Delo.&quot; The difficulty was ended by calling the paper &quot; Za Narodnoe Delo.&quot;Litvinoff&apos;s Activities.The anxiety caused to Bolshevik authorities- by events at Kronstadt is shown by the various precautionary measures taken by Litvinoff at the beginning of March. He went so far as to ask the Esthonian Govern-ment to guarantee the inviolability of his delegation in the event of the overthrow of the Soviet Government, and transferred valuables and certain documents to-a vessel lying in Reval harbour.Litvinoff is said to have organised an efficient intelligence service, which keeps Moscow well informed on every European country. Only native informants, well paid and reliable, and. not of necessity C,om-munists, have, been engaged in foreign countries. - A series of Russian and foreign. Communist papers have been started, such as the &quot;-Novj
Put &quot;in Helsingfors&apos;, and the &quot; Novi Mir&quot; in Berlin. These paper,?, and other similar organs published in Western Europe, are financed from the unlimited funds supplied by Moscow to. Litvinoff. . Zalewski, the &quot;Eye of Moscow,&quot; was one of Litvinoffs agents.Litvinoff is reported to have been instructed during February to send all details in his possession concerning W. Rothstein in Tilsit, and to transmit the latter&apos;s reports and the estimated cost, of propaganda in Prussia. He was also ordered to pay out another 30,000 gold roubles to the Esthoniau Communists. Later he was told to instruct W. Rothstein 10 be in Berlin by March and to pay him 200,000 German marks for his March expenses, this sum to be debited to the Third International.Miscellaneous.Indiscreet conduct recently brought about the return to Russia of Serjei Kalakutsky, the head of the Bolshevik Secret Intelligence organisation, &quot; Sauatarya.&quot; One Sergei Putev has succeeded him. Before his disgrace Kalakutsky was informed by Dzerjinsky that 190,000 gold roubles had been allotted for secret service Avork in Finland, Latvia, and Esthonia for the month of March. Kalakutsky is uoav reported to have been sent to England, where, however, no trace of his arrival or activity is yet discernible.There is evidence that the Lomonosoff Commission proposes to divert the repair of locomotives from England and Germany to&apos; Esthonian-works, on condition that the work is done in bulk by foreign capital. On the pretext that the discussion was merely technical, an agreement at Reval is to be slighted. The centralisation of questions of repair of&quot; locomotives abroad in the hands of Kerjentseff, the Soviet delegate in Stockholm, has apparently been sanctioned. \LATVIA. &apos;[Communism.The routing out of a secret meeting place of Communists at Riga has led to seAreral arrests and to the capture of much material dealing Avith the secret Communist organisations in the town. The whole Communist organisation is now being traced out.The Minister of the Interior, Mr. Berg, has declared that he is not apprehensive of Bolshevism. Mr. Berg considers the 20,000 repatriated refugees from Russia, who have tasted the blessings of Soivet rule, to be a political asset against Bolshevism.   30,000 more refugees are expected.The representatives of the Counterespionage Services of the Baltic States will discuss at their approaching conference the question, of watching the activities of the Social Democrat Party, Avhich is believed to be the medium of communication between Lettish Communism and Russia.&apos; -v . :v;:j&apos;:&apos;;:.       &apos;&apos;-,--:Russo-German Affairs.The Soviet Russian Representation is reported to have at Riga a department which issues money grants to the families..in Latvia of Lettish Red Army soldiers -now serving with the Bolsheviks. &apos;   ,&quot; Furstenberg-Kanetzky has denied that the Bolshevik Delegation is: supporting the strike of dockers and transport workers at Riga. The holding up of goods consigned to the Soviet authorities has apparently a good deal to. do with the matter;, The Soviet envoy has stated that-df; the Lettish Government does not immediately , end; the.; dispute the-
Russian Government will be obliged to ship all goods to Reval and none to Riga.German commercial activity is reported to be increasing markedly, to the alarm of the Government, which fears the economic subjection of the country to Germany. German firms havo already almost monopolised trade, and two large concerns, one of them backed by Hugo Stinnes, are about to be established in Kovno. The Cabinet has decided to watch the activities of these firms.LITHUANIA.The Lithuanian Authorities, offended by the placing of guards over, the Lithuanian Legation in Moscow and the searching of visitors on the pretext that the mission covers espionage, have notified Axelrod: that reciprocal measures will be taken with regard to the Bolshevik Mission to Kovno failing the removal of the guard in Moscow.The White Ruthenian Government which established itself in Lithuania at the time of Zeligovsk&apos;s Vilna coup, is said to aim at freeing the White Ruthenian provinces from.the Bolsheviks and at establishing an independent administration there. Social revolutionaries preponderate in the Government. The Soviet Government have withdrawn their recent demand that the White Rnthenian Government should be expelled from Lithuanian territory and now merely require it to abstain from issuing passports. Report has it that the Lithuanian Government links White Ruthenians and Bolsheviks, with the ulterior object of uniting all parties against the Poles. The While Ruthenian military party would appear to wish to settle with the Bolsheviks before attacking the Poles. Money is a pressing difficulty with the Ruthenians. As for an army, they hope eventually to raise a force of 20,000 men.POLAND.Anti-Soviet Movements.Savinkoff is said to believe in an advance of Russian forces in the West against the Soviet during the spring. Sympathetic elements in several Russian Governments had promised assistance, and the popula-tions would arise when an attack from Poland was launched. Savinkoff disapproved a premature rising by the Minsk organisation of his union. He insinuated that Pilsudski sympathised with his movement, which was approved by representatives of the Majority. Parties of the Sejm, in particular the leaders of the Peasant Party. If he could get money enough, Savinkoff said that he would transport Russian refugees from Lemnos, &amp;e., to Poland. He was doing all he could, hi1 spite of great difficulties, to come to an understanding with Budenny. Savinkoff had reliable information that Budenny was not a sincere Communist, and was quite willing to negotiate.The Uniate Archbishop of Lemberg, Mgr. Szeptycki, is reported to have undertaken to support Skoropad8ki&apos;s restoration to the Hetmanate following upon a declaration that Skoropadski considered the Greek Catholic Church to be the- National Church of the Ukraine. This implies the adhesion of- six million Ukrainians to Skoropadski&apos;s. cause; The Archbishop saidthat&apos; the Vatican wouhb approve the restoration of the Hetmanate under Skoropadski, whom he advised to secure1 the support of the Italian Government,
activities of the bund.Since its amalgamation with the Russian Communist Party the Central Committee of the new Jewish Bund Communist organisation has decided to open two propaganda bureaux in Europe with the view of spreading Bund Communism among flews and non-Jews all&apos; over the . world: A propaganda bureau under the leadership of Kornfeld is to be founded in Berlin, directly connected with organisations in neighbouring countries, and iu close contact with the late central bureau for the Bund organisation in Poland; The central bureau of the Bund in Warsaw, which up to the present has confined its work solely to Poland, will also control East Calicia, but must take orders given by the Berlin central. There will be another bureau in Paris with a branch in London. J. Lake will be chief.miscellaneous.The Poles are reported, from, an American source, to be sending a considerable number of troops to Yilna to reinforce Zeligowski.It is reported that the Minister to Soviet Russia will probably be Iodko-Narkevitch, now Minister to Turkey. He is pro-German, so much so that when he was in Stockholm as representative during the Regency, he was on intimate terms with the chief of the German eontra-espionage service. The representative of the Soviet in Warsaw is to be Gbolensky. General Azaroff, representing the Red General Staff, is already in Warsaw.5. BALKAN AND EAST EUROPEAN STATES.GREECE.the communist movement.There are said to be grounds for believing that recent labour troubles are preparatory to a forthcoming big effort. Communism has, however, no real hold in Greece, except in Salonika. Meanwhile a Union of Employers is at last being founded, to counterbalance the Labour Unions.The Communists themselves are divided over the application of the creed of Moscow, which has been accepted in principle. One section, headed by Papanastasion, wishes to apply the 21 points at once ; another section, led. by Sideris, Communist Deputy for Salonika, under Venizelos, wishes to postpone the Congress of the Greek Communist Party,, duejto be held on May 18th, till after the. next meeting of the Third International, in; order to wait upon events in Russia.The nature of much Greek Communism is illustrated by the experience, of. some recently engaged Austrian employees of a motor car works at piraeus,, who were taken to. the Communist centre; and asked to join-the Third International. They refused:on. the grounds tha-they belonged to the Amsterdam International. The Austrians were surprised to find at the centre portraits of Lenin and: Trotsky keeping; company, with one of King Constantino, but,the Greeks merely, remarked, &quot; Here we have to do it that way.&quot;i miscellaneous.Certain Gounarist. newspapers have, been, waging, a, violent campaign against the Allies and seeking to raise pro-German sympathies. A series-,ofi articles.on the:Anglo-French Secret:: Service during, the- war; is; promised,,showing how good Royalists were ill-treated.
Italian propaganda woidd seem to bo conducted in Greek labour circles with the object of paralysing Greek industry and convincing the world of tho instability of Greece. Money and literature are the means used. German propaganda works in somewhat the same way, but is less disguisedv - - .Report has it that once Constantino is recognised a clean sweep will be made of the Venizelists. The leaders will be dealt with legally and the small fry given over to the mercy of the Epistrates. Warrants have already been issued against Negreponte, the late Minister of Finance, and others. Constautine himself is alleged to have held a language for which historical precedent may be found, when he said that Venizelos out of power became dangerous and must be hunted down and annihilated. &quot; When you have him as Prime Minister, you can sleep quietly &quot; were the king&apos;s precedent words.JUGO-SLAVIA.Chapter and verse were given by M. Drashkovitch, Minister of the Interior, for every statement he advanced during a speech in Parliament defending the exceptional measures taken to repress Communism. The Minister revealed the plot to establish a Soviet Republic in Jugo-Slavia at the end of last year, declared that the Communist organisation extended even into the Government offices, and traced to Communist influence the epidemic of brigandage and murder which has afflicted South Serbia. Documents found on certain notorious murderers, lately rounded up and shot in Macedonia, proved that they were Communists, who had been terrorising the population into voting Communist at the late elections. These murderers had received supplies and weapons from persons now sitting in Parliament as Communist deputies. The Minister said that the Communists were in touch with Bulgarian comitadjis, and, in general, with anti-national elements. Funds came from Hungary and Russia. Parliament expressed confidence in the Government, and.. called upon it, if necessary, to proceed to severer measures. . ;The disclosure of their connection with Moscow is reported to have greatly weakened the Communists.BULGARIA.The progress of Communism has somewhat slackened, though the recent &quot; Red Month &quot; of propaganda produced some increase of strength. The small results obtained in the face of Agrarian opposition discontent the faint-hearted. In Varna, the membership of the party has con-siderably decreased. The &quot;Iskra&quot; Group (Extreme Communists) meditate a conference of their adherents, and in the meantime will work for the strengthening of their organisation. Their organ the &quot; Iskra&apos;&quot;&quot;: (&quot; Spark &quot;) has re-appeared after being suspended through lack of -funds. The Third Congress of the Communist Party will take place in Sofia -from May 8th to 10th.. Stambolisky is reported to have told the American Military Attache&apos;&apos; in Sofia that a number of Bulgarians return from the U.S.A. infected&apos; with Bolshevism, and bring with them Bolshevik literature.   Bulgarian -Communists occasionally receive donations from American sympathisers. The town,of Spokoen (? Spokane) has, for instance, sent a donation of 10,300 leva.Encouraged by the results of a preliminary trial, the Government called up for April 10th the first regular class for obligatory work, -
6. NEAR EASTERN STATES. EGYPT.No radical change is reported in the economic situation, but confidence has perceptibly increased since the Government took action with regard to cotton. The fall of prices has created a difficult situation, but the economic hardships of the Fellahin&apos; would appear to be far from desperate.The journey of Zaghloul Pasha from Alexandria to Cairo at the beginning of April was marked by enthusiastic scenes of Oriental veneration. These demonstrations of joy may easily be over-estimated. Egyptian agitators know how to organize claques, thus rendering it by no means easy to ascertain the real sentiments of street mobs or to decide who are out for piastres, Avho for &quot; patriotism.&quot; The feeling in official circles is still growing that a Treaty, on the lines of the Milner Report, is the only solution of the difficult problem which faces Egypt. It is reported to be improbable that under a system of Home Rule in Egypt the Pashas would begin their old game and fleece the Fellahin, for the reason that the Army, including the officers, is almost entirely Fellahin.Meanwhile reports late iu April&apos;-were hinting at the imminence of a breach between Zaghloul and Adii Pasha. Adli told an Egyptian reporter that the Cabinet intended to negotiate for independence hi its own way, but there was a vacancy for Zaghloul in the official delegation if he wished to accept it. ZaghlouPs demand is that the Cabinet shall in effect relinquish its responsibility iu the negotiations to the Nationalists and that the delegation shall accept him as president. Adli&apos;s reply may thus be construed as a challenge to Zagloul, who is reported to intend to concentrate on the overthrow of the Yeghen Cabinet.Matthew Giles, the English Trades Unionist, whose activities in Malta have been noted, has been campaigning in Egypt, ostensibly for the linking up of the local Workers&apos; Syndicate with the Workers&apos; Union in England. His activities have been connected with the Syndicate. He addressed a meeting of the &quot; Syndicat&apos; Ouvrier International de 1&apos;Isthme de Suez&quot; which decided to join the Federated Union of Workers. . Giles&apos;s speeches have on the whole been moderate. It is, however, to be noted that a strike at the Anglo-Egyptian Oilfield Refineries at Suez broke out shortly after Giles&apos;s visit to that place. Giles was of necessity much in contact with Dr. Skouphopoulos, a Greek subject, resident at Suez and President of the Workers&apos; Syndicate. This person developed pro-German activities during the war and has connections with the Egyptian Nationalists.PERSIA.The Persian Government appear to be by no means delighted at the approach of Rothsteiu. They have informed him with Oriental politeness that they anticipate with pleasure his arrival at Teheran, but they intimate that he should bring at present only a small number of his suite to Teheran. The rest should go to Baku, and not proceed to Teheran without first informing the Government arid obtaining their permission. The suite is, in the opinion of Teheran, far more than is necessary for the mere work of&apos;the Legation. Moreover, Rothstein is not a desirable representative, and the Persian Government agree to receive him only because to refuse would be difficult and might produce a bad impression.   The Persian
Minister in Berlin has been asked to send information by wireless as to the personnel of the Soviet delegation.Jaugali Communists were reported on April 20th to be bombarding the lines evacuated by the English and now held by Government troops. The Persian Government has protested to the Russian Government and to the Russian Representative who is on his way to Persia and has now reached Shahrud.The Revolutionary Council of the Persian Army has informed the Council for Propaganda and Action among the Eastern peoples that the group headed by Agaeff has created an impossible condition of things in Resht and Engeli by electing a new Central Committee which defies the Central Committee of the Communist Party, misuses the names of Buniat-Zade and other revolutionaries and circulates provocative rumours about the revolutionary committee of the Persian Army. Agaeff&apos;s brother has offered 500 men to the local revolutionary committee with-out the knowledge of the Army Revolutionary Council. It is pointed out that such actions are likely to prejudice the Communist Party in the eyes of the Persian nation, and should be stopped before work for the cause is systematically destroyed.7. central asiatic states. turkestan.Addressing the Tenth Communist Congress at Moscow, Commissary Safaroff mournfully proclaimed the inhabitants of Turkestan to be com-pletely unenlightened as to the ideals of Communism, of which they had the vaguest notions. He went so far as to say that most of those who had joined the Communist Party Avere extreme reactionaries, men of the &quot; Black Hundred,&quot; whose only motive was to be on the winning side. The vice-president of the Executive Central Committee of the Turkestan Communists was actually a former president of the League of the Archistrateg Michael, nicknamed the &quot; Black Hundred,&quot; Safaroff pleaded for genuine Communist propaganda among the Turcomen.According to Russian statements the forces of the Emir in Bokhara are being successfully liquidated and only an insignificant part of Eastern Bokhara is now in the hands of the Emir. The Soviet is drawing up a constitution for the Soviet Republic of Bokhara and dealing with various internal questions.Industry has disappeared in the eastern districts of Turkestan, thanks to Bolshevik exploitation. The Bolsheviks rob the inhabitants of every-thing and preach Communism. Even the mosques are used for propa-ganda among the Mohammedans.The Moscow wireless announces that the elections to the Tashkend Soviet have resulted in the return of 713 Communist and 42 non-party delegates.afghanistan.An impression is reported to prevail in Kabul that there is little likelihood of a final decision being reached in the near future in the matter of the negotiations between Great Britain and Afghanistan. The Afghan dealings with the Russian Soviet, which wishes to set up various Consulates near the Indian frontier, ostensibly for commercial purposes, really, it is supposed, as centres for propaganda and intrigue among the tribesmen, are likely to be a grave obstacle. It is considered in certain quarters that unless Afghanistan prohibits the establishment of such
Consulates, the British Mission will return to India without concluding the proposed treaty.Abdul Rahman Peshawari has been appointed the ambassador of the Angora Government at Kabul. He went previously to Moscow with a request from Mustapha Kemal that the Soviet government should give all possible help in the matter of Indian frontier tribes, and with iustruc-tions to say that the Turks would not hinder Bolshevik propaganda, in accordance with the treaty terms between Angora and Moscow. Abdul Rahman appears to have impressed the Red leaders favourably. He refused to embrace Communism and said that his desire was to destroy the British Empire. He promised Chattopadhaya that he would use all his influence to help the Indian cause, provided there was no &quot; Hindu-Mohammedan&quot; question, and that a Mahommedan was appointed in due time as Indian revolutionary representative at Kabul. His chief aim in going there was to obtain regular touch with the Khalifat movement in Afghanistan.When funds have been received from Moscow, Dr. Abdul Hafiz is to open a munition factory in Afghanistan on behalf of the Indian revolu-tionaries. He is an expert chemist, with much experience in a munition factory in Austria.GEORGIA.On occupying Tiflis, the Bolsheviks set up a revolutionary committee largely composed of Georgian Communists. The president is Philip Makharadze, apparently identical with the individual of that name on the Council of Action and Propaganda in Baku. The Bolsheviks are Issuing a paper called &quot;The Communist&quot; printed iu Russian and Georgian.The reasons which determined the Bolshevik attack on Georgia are to be found in the proceedings at an unofficial conference of the Council of People&apos;s Commissars in Moscow. Here Dzerjinsky, supported by Bukharin, was very violent. He declared that Transcaucasia would not be won until Georgia was conquered, and that an independent Georgia was a double danger for the Soviet authorities a base for Entente intrigues, and an example to and encouragement of (he Mountaineers and Mussulmans iu their efforts to free themselves from the Bolshevik yoke. The independence of Georgia also complicated Russian relations with the Kemalists. Iu the event of an alliance between the Kemalists and Georgia, Tiflis as a political centre might become the point from which the anti-Bolshevik union of all Moslems of the Caucasus would operate. It would be criminal not to complete the re-establishment of Russia according to the 1914 frontiers. Lenin deprecated fanciful schemes. He pointed out that Georgia was not Poland, and that it would not be difficult to conquer her, but an attack under prevailing conditions would compromise the whole Bolshevik policy in Europe and might prejudice negotiations with the Kemalists at a moment when the Entente was trying to obtain closer relations with them. Until the question of the sovietisatiou of Georgia arose, they must abstain from aggressive action.ARMENIA.The Council of People&apos;s Commissaries at Moscow has granted a subsidy iof 1,500,000 gold roubles to Soviet Armenia.According to Moscow the short-lived rule of the Dashnaks is over. Messages from Teheran and Erivan describe the Bolshevik sweep upon
Erivan, the flight of the,inhabitants and tho burning of the city. In the occupied villages&quot; prbmiiiont&apos; supporters of the National Democratic Government of Armenia have been executed.AZERBAIJAN.Azerbaijan has been complaining that the Persian government supported the risings in Mughan and Lenkoran ; the Persian reprosenta-tive in reply protests good intentions, blames delays in communicating with Teheran, and suggests a joining of the Persian and Azerbaijan telegraphic lines. The Persian ConsiiJ-Genoral in Tiflis has complained to the Azerbaijan representative in Georgia concerning the requisitioning of goods of Persian traders in Azerbaijan.FAR EASTERN STATES.SIBERIA. The Disillusions of the Peasantry.The peasants are everywhere in revolt against the Soviet regime. The general state of civil war has cut them off from the Communist stream and they live their own life. Efforts to control the peasants by village &quot; Committees of the Poor,&quot; similar to those created in European Russia, have had no result, except that Communists now refuse to be appointed to village committees in Siberia. Compulsory requisitions bring in very little ; the peasants have been known to fire their stocks rather than surrender them to the authorities. At the &quot; collecting points &quot; are frequently to be seen stocks that are rotten and unfit for consumption. The authorities have been obliged to abandon their attempts to register cattle.Grain sent to the Central provinces of Russia disappears by the trainload, seized on the way by some local Commissariat which is short of food. The breakdown of transport causes trains to stand for months on sidings. The scheme to restore transport by compulsory labour among the peasants and the Red soldiers failed owing to the resistance offered it.The Anti-Bolshevik Revolt.- Reports of peasant risings are numerous. In the Minusinsk district the power has passed to the Zemstvos supported by the peasants, and the Bolsheviks have been unablo to re-establish themselves. In the Yeneseisk Government large numbers of the regular Bolshevik troops deserted to the insurgents, and the Bolsheviks have decided only to employ Communist detachments in their operations. In the Irkutsk Government, 20,000 peasants have reinforced the insurgents in the -Taiga area. Many bourgeois from the towns and a number of Red Army troops have gone over. The movement is developing an organised democratic tendency. Delegates of the Peasants&apos; Unions and secret military organisations have been in vladivostock in pursuit of unity. A secret committee has been formed in Vladivostock representing all Democrats and Right Social Revolutionaries. Financial difficulties are, however, very great. The various groups are said to be in touch with . General Pepelaieff in Harbin, whom they look upon as their leader.Another would-be: leader is reported to be Captain Kalashnikqv, who left Wrangel&apos;s, administration on account of its reactionary tendencies, &quot;but found himself no happier with the Bolsheviks.   He is reported to
have come to Vladivostock from his hiding place in the Taiga area, in order to establish a political centre controlling the anti-Bolshevik movement. He wants to organise and unite the military groups co-operating with the insurgent peasant movement and to interest the Allied powers.The Red Army.The Red Army in Siberia appears to comprise three groups regular troops, &quot; Okhrana&quot; (Guard) detachments, and territorial regiments. The regulars are quarted principally in the important towns ; the guard detachments watch the railways, carry out requisitions, and convoy foodstuffs; the territorials consist of cadres of instructors, engaged, without great success, in giving military knowledge to the ordinary inhabitants.The arrival of 50,000 troops at Chita is rumoured to foreshadow Bolshevist military operations against the Japanese. 18,000 soldiers have reached Verkhne-Udiusk from Moscow, and 40,000 more have arrived at Habarovsk. The Japanese have appointed General Tachibana, one of their ablest officers, to command their forces. Ignorant as they are of happenings abroad, the non-Communist members of the Chita Assembly have declared their agreement with the opponents of foreign intervention in Russia. The Russians are protesting against Japanese appropriation of the Siberian fisheries.The Chita Government is reported not to have recognised the Anglo-Russian trade agreement as applyiug to the territory under. its jurisdiction.   It expects to conclude an Anglo-Chita agreement.JAPAN.Foreign observers are mostly agreed in judging symptoms of unrest to be at present mainly superficial, and caused by the national vanity and changeableness. Causes for fundamental discontent are wanting; the excessively high prices are counterbalanced by advances of wages, though the salaried class suffers greatly. New ideas are fermenting, however ; the works of Marx are among the books having the largest sale at the leading Tokyo bookstore. At a large technical school near Tokyo, students and teachers have combined to form a revolutionary society, with a propaganda magazine called &quot; The Aurora Borealis.&quot;9. BRITISH COLONIES. CANADA.Communism and Revolutionary Movements.Evidence from different sources reports numerous secret meetings, and it is believed that the malcontents mean mischief. The reports regarding the arms at their command are contradictory; some time ago, however, an unconfirmed story was received from the Eastern United States that arms were being shipped to the Pacific Coast to be smuggled into British Columbia. The revolutionaries intend to appeal to the discontent caused by the general discontinuance of relief in the spring. In the East, especially, agitators are doing all they can to exasperate the needy. Although direct evidence is lacking, indications show that revolutionary agitation is conducted under direction   from outside the country.O AS 8841 . E
Foreigners, whose dislike for English-speaking workmen becomes more and more noticeable, continue their revolutionary propaganda.At the beginning of April some anxiety was felt in Vancouver, where rumours from various sources reported that the local revolutionaries were planning an armed revolt on tho Russian model. The date of the rising, however, is said to have been postponed to June 3rd, and postponement in this case, as in most, probably means failure. Meanwhile the revolu-tionaries are watching current events in Great Britain with great eagerness. They had planned to rush the banks in order to obtain money, and to seize arms and ammunition. They believe that sufficient men would be available, but they lack a satisfactory leader. Pritchard, who apparently was to have led the rising and is released from imprisonment, has pleaded ill-health a plea distrusted by the labour people.It is reported that no branch of the Communist Party exists in Victoria, but the local branch of the Socialist Party has discussed affilia-tion with the Third International, and has voted in favour of. a secret referendum.Careful investigation in Western Canada has so far discovered no trace of a Communist Party in the sense of a formed and organised body affiliated with the Third International and obeying the twenty-one points. The more revolutionary societies are disinclined on the whole to amalga-mate. The Winnipeg local has given its reasons for objecting to affiliation. These include such points as dissatisfaction with the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, distrust of the judgment of Moscow as regards conditions in North America, and dislike for underground policy. The Communist Party in Western Ontario, however, is exceedingly busy, and is probably gaining adherents among the foreigners. It has been impossible so far to ascertain where its secret newspaper the &quot; Communist Bulletin &quot; is printed.The United Communist Party is devoting its energy to breaking up meetings, especially those which show loyalty. They direct much attention to the meetings of the international unions.One of the chief French&apos;papers of Montreal predicts a general election in October next, with Bolshevism, which it alleges to be a real menace in Canada, as the chief issue.True bills have been found against Mariner, Fry, Haslem, and Seminoff, the Hamilton agitators. Their counsel has undertaken to join the Hamilton Defence Fund, which is to be reorganised when the trial is over, and managed and controlled by communists only, the money collected to be used for propaganda, both legal and illegal. The foreign revolutionaries Nicholas Nicolaeff and his wife Marie are reported to have left very secretly for Russia.Antilla Juntunen, the Finnish agitator, has pleaded guilty to being unlawfully in Canada, and has been sentenced to a fine or 30 days&apos; imprisonment and deportation.There is a report in Toronto that a Bolshevist representative is to be sent to Canada to protect Russian revolutionists who get into trouble, and to spread propaganda. This man is to be under Krassin, who hopes to represent the Soviet in Canada, and it is probable that he will be a sort of Soviet Consul under the terms of the trade agreement.The Ukrainian Revolutionists.Reports on the revolutionary element among the Ukrainians continue, In Ontario and Quebec they appear to be particularly active ; the Ukrainian Labour Temple Association appears to extend over a considerable portion of the Dominion. The object of the Association is to spread Communism ; its Executive is believed to be the Executive of
the Communist Party, which has so far made little headway among the foreigners in Canada. The Ukrainians are trying to organise branches in all parts of Canada as a preliminary preparation for the Third International. It is believed that Jews and English-speaking people are also being secretly organised.Labour Troubles.Labour disturbances on May Day are said to have been greater than originally appeared ; they followed on orders chiefly emanating from the American headquarters of the international union. In harmony with the American strikers, the&apos;jobbing printers in most Canadian centres have struck to enforce the union&apos;s demands for a 44-hour week, with an increase of wages equal to 48 hours. The Typographical Union is one of the strongest labour organisations on the continent, and the strike extends from Halifax to Vancouver. Newspaper employees are not yet involved, but they too may be ordered out. In several of the smaller cities the employers have declared open shop, and are publishing curtailed papers until they are able to secure staffs. Several Newfoundland dailies have temporarily ceased publication.Strikes have also been ordered by the International Brotherhood of Pulp Paper Workers. The majority of plants in Canada are already affected ; the remainder will probably follow suit on May 11, when the present contracts expire, unless the companies withdraw the proposed 15-20 per cent, reductions of wages. The Canadian strike is conducted from New York, where it is stated arbitration has been refused.On the other hand, the prolonged strike of Canadian packing-house employees has completely broken down in most places, the majority of strikers having been replaced by non-unionists. The strikers are workless.Feeling among the miners in the Sydney mines is reported very bad, and the management of the mines unpopular.Reports of strikes in other trades come from various quarters. The Unions are, however, in a bad way.The former President of the Dominion Trades and Labour Congress is reported to have said that the Unions are practically without funds, and the men discontented and dissatisfied with their leaders. Many members of the One Big Union have meanwhile become non-union labour. They realise that the O.B.U. is a failure, but they dislike the International and refuse to join it.A number of agitators are preaching a six-hour day for the purpose of counteracting the lowered wages.Unemployment.Although a certain amount of unemployment is unavoidable at present, conditions are satisfactory. Conditions in British Columbia are quiet on the whole, and there is little unemployment outside the cities. The lumber camps are rapidly reopening, the men have made no resistance to the reduction of wages (by about one-quarter), and the employers are able to pick and choose their men. In consequence few agitators are getting into the camps, and a hard time appears to loom before the Loggers&apos; Union during the summer.A report from Ontario stated that at the beginning of April there was no industrial trouble of any kind. The men accepted a cut of 18 per cent, in wages a short time ago, and more recently they agreed to work for ten hours at eight-hour rate of pay.E2
Montreal is looking forward to a busy season, and the usual labour demands for increased wages, with strikes to enforce these demands, are noticeably absent.Indian Agitation.Dr. N. S. Hardikar, who has been touring Canada, delivering increasingly seditious speeches, described himself as the official envoy of Indian Nationalists, and claimed to have received orders from them to request all Indians in Canada to return to their native land. He is reported to be intriguing with Sinn Feiners. Hardikar is now under-stood to be asking the British&apos; Embassy in Washington for a passport for India. His visit to British Columbia caused the Hindoos there to take more interest in labour agitation than they have ever done before.A new Indian Society has appeared under the name of &quot; The Hindustani Home-Rule League of Canada,&quot; apparently distinct from and possibly a rival or successor to the &quot; United India Home-Rule League of Canada.&quot;Publicity is given to the Indian revolutionary news in &quot;Ireland,&quot; the organ of the Self-Determination League for Ireland in Vancouver.At a meeting of the Chadr Party in Stockholm, California, recently, which was attended by between two and three thousand Indians, chiefly Sikhs, Mr. Shastri, the elected Secretary, openly advocated rebellion. Resolutions were passed in favour of the Irish &quot; martyrs.&quot;Miscellaneous.An investigation into the International Bible Students&apos; Association has been made. The Association appears to be thoroughly antagonistic to the authority of the State.The &quot;B.C. Federationist,&quot; which is in monetary difficulties, has started a &quot; drive &quot; to secure financial aid. The paper leans towards the Communist point of view, although it does not absolutely advocate the Third International.An attempt has been made to form a Canadian National Union of Ex-Service men (N.U.X.) in Vancouver. So far, however, no forceful personality has appeared in its ranks, and the members are averse to any form of leadership.A somewhat radical body has aroused attention recently in the name of the International Union of Timber Workers. Although at present an American body, it may extend its operations to British Columbia. While advocating industrial Unionism, it is yet financed and supported by the American Federation of Labour.SOUTH AFRICA.The labour situation is viewed with some anxiety, for it is improbable that the inevitable cut in wages will be accepted without a struggle. The furniture workers have rejected the notice given by the employers, in order to control ca&apos; canny methods, to terminate existing agree-ments and increase the hours of work from 40 to 44 per week. In consequence, they were all discharged and &quot; open shop &quot; proclaimed. Labour retaliated by proclaiming a boycott of all open shops, including a withdrawal of engineers ; and decided to take a ballot on the question of a general strike. They also decided to purchase a factory and start the manufacture of furniture on co-operative lines.The annual congress of the Cape Federation of Labour Unions decided to affiliate with the Third International. Sabotage has been advocated by A. B. Dunbar in his speeches at Communist gatherings.
Sinn Fein sympathisers are believed to be joining the cause in increasing numbers, especially in and around Durban.AUSTRALIA.Communism.The activities of the revolutionary section, hitherto comparatively negligible, have recently taken a definite shape. Towards the eud ,of last year meetings of all the parties were held, and at a conference in December a Constitution was adopted and final arrangements made for launching the new organisation. A serious split, however, occurred. The Australian Socialist Party, which aspired to rule the entire Com-muuist movement, found itself faced with the opposition of the other representatives and with certain proposed conditions involving the com-plete submergence of the Socialist Party as an individual party. The Socialists withdrew, and the leaders declared themselves the one and only genuine Communist Party, affiliated with and recognised by the Third International.The other group, which calls itself the Central Executive, also claims the right to represent the Third International. Both groups are under observation, and the Government is considering the advisability of taking action against them.Yet another group, made up of undesirables and known as the &quot; Secret Seven,&quot; flatters itself that it is unknown to the authorities. Its organisa-tion closely resembles the &quot; germ-cell&quot; system and is potentially dangerous.The Internal Situation.Bolshevism appears, however, to have no charms for Labour, although in Brisbane Russians and other aliens occasionally foment Bolshevist outbursts. Their meetings are usually broken up by the Returned Soldiers&apos; Association, who prevent acts of disloyalty. During a recent disturbance caused by aliens and other undesirables a complete battalion of returned soldiers mobilised entirely on the initiative of the Associa-tion, and quickly dispersed the rioters. Still a feeling of impending trouble prevails ; unemployment, the basic ,wage, the large number of aliens, and general, discontent all tend to intensify unrest; capita], small or large, feels that it is being exploited by the Labour Government, and country farmers protest that the Governments generosity to labour in the towns tempts men from the country and piles up taxation. The efforts of trade unions, workmen&apos;s associations, &amp;c, are all directed towards gaining support for the Labour Party in Parliament and helping forward the case of the workers against the capitalist class.The anti-empire and revolutionary tendencies of labour have, how-ever, been checked by the sweeping victory gained by the Liberals in South Australia, where only 16 Labour members were elected in a House of 46. The Progressive Party, which tried to drive a wedge between the Liberals and Labour, was entirely wiped out.Labour in New South Wales.The election of Mr. Lambert by the New South Wales Labour Con-ference was considered to be a victory for the section opposed to the Government. The debates between the two factions were very acri-monious. Intrigues marked the election of officers, which was hotly contested. The re-election of the old executive would place the Govern-ment in an awkward position, for the Labour Government is dependent
on the executive of the party outside Parliament, and although Mr. Storey has resisted the demand to swamp the Council with Labour nominees to secure the passing of Labour legislation, to refuse to obey the behests of the executive in all matters is tantamount to risking political annihilation. The Australian Workers&apos; Union dominates the executive ; one union therefore practically controls the legislation and administration of the whole State.Strikes.The New Castle Steelworks, belonging to the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, Ltd., have been closed, owing to strikes at the Company&apos;s mines. 5,000 men are out of work.The dispute between miners and owners has been settled, except in one or two cases, where the &quot; go slow &quot; policy is still being adhered to. Throughout the Dominion the miners had determined not to earn more than 19s. 2d. a day, the minimum rate under the Coal Agreement of February 1920, and in consequence the output was reduced about one-third and many industrial concerns were seriously handicapped.Miscellaneous.Australia is said to be anxious to negotiate an immigration agreement with the United States.Bishop Phelan&apos;s insults to the Union Jack were strongly condemued at the Protestant Federation and Nationalist gatherings at Melbourne. The Government was urged by resolution to prevent the recurrence of such &quot; vile outbursts &quot; by introducing legislation to suppress disloyalty.Diamonds and emeralds believed to have formed part of the Russian crown jeAvels are reported to have been offered for sale in Australia. So far no confirmation of this repbrt has been received.Mr. Hughes has promised the House of Representatives that prejudice against the Soviet Government shall not be allowed to interfere with trade with Soviet Russia. He is inquiring into iht report that Russia is prepared to take Australia^ whole output of lead and zinc, for which she will pay in cash.Work in the Commonwealth Governments shipbuilding enterprise at Cockatoo Island, Sydney, has been stopped for want of funds. This is scarcely surprising in view of the fact disclosed during a Parliamentary inquiry that &quot; bottom platers &quot; on the 5,000 ton ship &quot; Moonbah &quot; earned 3Z. 11s. Id, a day, or 93/. Is. 2d. a month ; labourers received 21. 18s. a day, or 751. 8s. a month; workmen employed on the floor made 21. 18s. a day, and labourers 21. 7s. id.A recent Labour Conference in Sydney resolved to petition the King to withdraw all troops from Ireland.NEW ZEALAND.Labour has been utterly defeated in the receut municipal elections, and has lost the ground Avon two years ago. The public has no desire to be ruled by the extremists, and disapproves the prodigal programme of the Labour Party.At a conference of the New Zealand Alliance of Labour held about the end of last year it was decided to weld all the unions in the country into one organisation. Considerable diversity of opinion showed itself with regard to direct action, which was opposed by the majority of Labour Leaders.
Under a recent amendment to the Arbitration Act tho Arbitration Court may now take evidence for tho revision of a wages award if it is considered that the granting of such, an award would react unfavourably on industry. The formation of guilds of clerks, bank employees, &amp;c, has also been legalised, and these have been placed on a similar footing to the Trade Unions in regard to the giving of evidence by representatives before the Arbitration Court in wages disputes. The Trade Unions consider this a secession of the clerical classes fiom the ranks of the workers and a blow struck by the Government at the whole principle of Trade Unions. The members of the Guilds intend to settle their disputes by direct discussion with employers when possible.The Returned Soldiers&apos; Association throughout the Dominion have passed resolutions of protest regarding the number of Hindus who were arriving. The Auckland Branch even suggested that the next batch should be forcibly prevented from landing. It has been suggested to the Government that the number of Asiatics allowed to enter for permanent residence be fixed in definite proportion to the total population.SAMOA.The recent considerable native unrest in Samoa has very largely subsided. The visits of H.M. warships and an ordinance for the prevention of intimidation passed by the Legislative Council in January have greatly steadied opiuion, and assurances of loyalty have been received from the native chiefs.10. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Communism.The American headquarters of the Third International were raided on the eve of May Day, and two prominent officials, Abram Jackira and Israel Amter, were arrested. Documents revealing preparations for a nation-wide revolution, together with lists of leaders in every large city in the States, are alleged to have been found.The &quot; Poindexter Bill&quot; &quot;to protect the property, processes, and agencies of the Government of the United States from anarchy and Bolshevism &quot; imposes 40 years&apos; imprisonment, or a $50,000 fine, or both, on anyone who encourages the &quot;unlawful&quot; injury of public or private property, either as a general principle or in particular instances. Under the &quot; Duplex &quot; decision of the Supreme Court a strike involves &quot; injury of property.&quot;Unemployment.Business conditions are reported to be growing more and more serious, and there are ominous predictions of bread queues next winter unless there is a speedy improvement. The decision of the Labour Board to terminate the national agreements and leave the adjustment of working conditions and wages to the railways and employees is considered to be a step in the right direction.The Labour Unions claim that the Government estimate of 3,000,000 unemployed is far too low ; they say that there are at least 5,000,000 at present without employment.Labour Unrest.A general reduction of 25 per cent, in wages was announced by the American Steamship Owners&apos; Association to come into force on May 1st,
whereupon tho executive of the Seamon&apos;s Union replied that a strike on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts would begin tho same day. The Association have refused to submit tho dispute to arbitration on the grounds that it is contrary to business judgment, principle, and precedent. Numerous workers are said to have left their ships in New York, Boston, &amp;c. The Association hope, however, to keep their ships moving with the aid of non-union men, of whom there are more than 30,000 available. Meanwhile, unless a speedy settlement is reached, the Union leaders declare that the strike will tie up every vessel under the American flag, involving 13,000,000 tons of shiping and 120,000 meu. Later reports state that, although negotiations have not yet been announced, there are rumours that an early settlement of the strike may be expected.The movement toAvards wage reduction is general. The American Express Company fears that it may have to withdraw the Avhole 35 per cont. increase granted last August. A reduction of from 20 to 25 per cent, in the pay of railwaymen is expected Avithiu the next few weeks, and for the first time since 1904 the United States Steel Corporation has decided to reduce Avages. The suggested reduction is 20 per cent., day labourers&apos; pay to be adjusted equitably. An effort is being made by the Corporation to abandon the 12-hour day, which is &quot;unsatisfactory to the employees.&quot; So far there has been no suggestion of a strike. Nearly 175,000 men are affected.The lock-out of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers has now lasted 21 weeks, and the defence fund has reached over $1,200,000.   The struggle appears to be going in favour of the workers, more than half of Avhom are back at Avork, and 450 shops are using amalgamated, labour.Concessions from the Bolsheviks.Under cover of a Dane named Riehterdahl, the forest expert of Anderson, Meyer, and Company, the Americans are endeavouring to obtain from the Bolsheviks large forest concessions in the Maritime Region round Port Imperial, reported to total 14,000,000 dessiatines. The local branch of the company has chauged its name to the American Commer-cial and Industrial Company, Ltd. Smith, of the Railway Committee, is in close touch with this company. The Americans are reported to be secretly working to obtain the control of the railways in this region also, and to be playing a double game. Smith&apos;s party is making advances to the Chita government, and is very intimate Avith Kojevnikov and the Vladivostock Communists, Avhile the Consul professes neutrality.Sinn Fein.A report has been received that a Sinn Fein Army has been formed in the United States. Units are training at Philadephia and Boston ; 100 men are said to have reached Ireland already this year, Avhile 50 are believed to be going to Germany to study submarines. The newly formed Clan-na-Gael, connected with de Valera&apos;s association, appears to be behind the volunteer organisation. Hoffmann, a former member of the German Flying Corps, and an Indian from Bombay have addressed meetings of the volunteers. Letters which have been passed between Justice Cohalan, Director of the Friends of Irish Freedom, and Mr. de Valera have recently been published. De Valera is accused of delibe-rately splitting the Irish Movement in America. The chief bones of contention are de Valera&apos;s claim to sole control of the funds and Cohalan&apos;s assertion that no citizen of another country should be permitted to inter-fere in American affairs.
Amazing perversions of the truth appear iu Sinn Feiu papers, which paint lurid pictures of famine and pestilence rampant throughout Ireland. Editors who state facts disagreeable to the Irish-Americans are exposed to agitation and importunity, and secure no compensating advantage. It is therefore easier and more politic to take the line of the least resistance.A new way of countering propaganda in the anti-British and Sinn Fein press has been found in the form of a widely worn button, which reads : &quot; I do not read Hearsts papers.&quot;the indian agitation.The Berlin Indian Committee have directed the various American organisations, especially the Ghadr Party in San Francisco, not to write direct to H. N. Roy, or to anyone in Russia, except through them; Roy&apos;s action in persuading the Soviet Government to send 4.0,000 dollars to the Ghadr Party without their knowledge has greatly piqued the Committee. S. N. Kar, now iu America, will probably be the head of the local Indian Executive Committee in Berlin. He has been invited to come to Stockholm or Berlin as soon as possible. As regards the donation to the Ghadr Party for propaganda, Chattopadhaya seems to have been particulary anxious to suspend it until all parties were united under one responsible head in Europe.miscellaneous.The visit to Europe of Mr. W. L. Johnston, president of the Inter-national Association of Machinists, is officially stated to be for the purpose of investigating the status of railway workers, but it is rumoured that his real object is to promote closer affiliation between American and European labour organisations, with a view to world-wide action in case of strikes.A petition has been sent to President Harding by the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, to urge Congress to pass legislation Which will put a stop to lynching, eradicate the practice of &quot; peonage,&quot; or enforced labour, and restore the franchise to the negroes in the South. He has also been asked to appoint negroes as assistant secretaries of labour and agriculture.11. central american states. mexico,the menace of communism.When in the usual turmoil of Mexican politics Obregon displaced Carranza as President last year, Mexican Communism received a great impetus. The Carranza revolution was, in Communist opinion, comparable with the Milyukov revolution in Russia, an uprising of small landholders and bourgeois elements backed by workers without class consciousness ; the Obregon revolution was similar but with a strong infusion of prole-tarian elements and a frank expression of proletarian ideas by many of the leaders. Organised Communism, however, iu view of the dense ignorance and lack of class consciousness of the Mexican peasants and workers, held aloof and deoided to pursue a policy of education and agitation. In a wordy report to Zinovieff the leaders claim to have so far succeeded as to have prepared the ground for a Communist experiment upon a large scale. They are probably right is so far as the prevalent insecurity and economic misery promote discontent and anarchy.Prominent and extremist labour leaders such as Marones, Salcedo Carillo, Gasca and De la Huerta have become dominating figures under
the new regime and have secured freedom of action for their plans. There is no police force, no military union, no Government office without its Extremist in some leading post. Some of those chief executive officers are openly Socialist, Communist or Anarchist, whilst others are secretly connected with some of the Extremist revolutionary organisations. Strike has succeeded strike ; each has usually ended in a surrender to the workers&apos; demands. Obregon himself is a solitary, practically friendless figure. So weak is his position that last February when he ordered the suppression of a threatening demonstration in Mexico City his orders were flung in his face and his officials joined the demonstrators.The Communist, or rather the labour, movement seems inclined, however, to hold its hand, partly for fear of United States intervention and partly because the Mexican proletariat is not yet sufficiently educated for a Communist regime. Meanwhile, propaganda continues and military preparations are maturing. It would be easy enough, even now, to bring about a revolution, but it is difficult to know who or what would emerge from the consequent welter. The Mexican leaders are without political or administrative genius and they appear to look for political help to Soviet Russia and Japan. Russia would, of course, obtain the recognition and help for which she is striving ; Japan would be wooed by the promise of concessions to immigrants and in laud, mines and oil-fields. The path to political recognition, and, if necessary, to military help against United States intervention, would thus be opened. Obregon&apos;s Radical advisers are playing to the United States, and trying to convince America that the Government is stable and to foster American investments in Mexico. Against this has been working a strong Communist propaganda aiming at arousing sentiment against intervention both in Mexico and in the United States.Outside the nominal Government stands the &quot; Council of Six,&quot; which is indeed the real Mexican Government. Its members Linn A.E. Gale, Salcedo, General Cales, Phillipo Carillo, Robert Habeiman and a military officer in the State of Monterey, are American and Mexican extremists, actively intriguing with Russia and Japan and holding supreme power over the Mexican Red Army. As regards Russia, the &quot; Council of Six,&quot; through their associates in the Cabinet, are urging Obregon to sign a commercial and political treaty with the Bolsheviks. Lincoln Steffons is now in Mexico, and appears to have brought Obregon to a state of mind in which he will yield many things which Soviet Russia is striving to obtain in Mexico..The Red Army is very strong and well organised on the usual lines of secrecy and terror, and includes in its ranks about 40 per cent, of the regular army in Mexico. The military officers in the Federal District, in the district of Monterey, in certain regions of the State of Tampico, in the district of Pachuca, and in many other centres are amongst its members. It has large secret stores of arms and ammunition and even its own plant for the preparation of the weapons of war. The Communists claim that the part of the army which remains is saturated with Bolshevism.It is to be noted that the Mexican Labour Party, though it permitted the Communists to take part in its annual convention, rejected the principles of the Third International, and contented itself with a vague, all-embracing, socialistic resolution. In commenting on the rejection of their resolution the Communist delegates refer to the extreme ignorance of the Mexican ranch workers, many of whom have never even heard of the 21 points, and know almost nothing about International Communism. They considered, however, that this would not have mattered, and that the rank and file would have adopted the resolution had the leaders
pressed it, and they contend that the real reason for the opposition of the leaders was fear of American intervention. The Communists are confident that the workers of Mexico offer no objection to Communist propaganda. There is little doubt that they have a virgin field of ignorance to work upon. The great fear of the Communists is that in trying to got away from capitalism the Mexican toilers may go too far in the other direction and plunge into what are styled &quot; anarcho-syndicalist absurdities and taugles.&quot;The manifest danger is that to the Mexican peon &quot;Capitalist&quot; is synonymous with &quot;Foreigner&quot; and that an anti-capitalist campaign must entail attacks upon the person and property of Americans and English.miscellaneous.A man calling himself Chakravarti, living near the border in Mexico, is reported to be corresponding with S. N. Kar. Letters from Europe are said to be reaching the G-haclr party through the efforts of Mr. Franz Bopp, a close relative of the late German Consul-General, who has recently been released from internment.Two million is to be spent annually on machinery in the United States by the Secretary of Agriculture, but Mexico has entered into an agreement with the International Association of Machinists to do business with none but union firms in the United States when ordering machinery.12. south american states. argentine.the spread of anarchy.Considerable unrest is apparent. Anarchy is said to be spreading rapidly from the north, through the Forestal and Las Palmas del Chaco properties, and on through Cordova, Santa Fe, &amp;c. Strikes are frequent and serious, and in almost every case the weight of the Government appears to be thrown on the side of Labour to the detriment of the employers and the country in general. In the province of Cordova a general strike has been declared as a protest against certain Government measures.   Further trouble is anticipated.a socialist split.The Fourth Extraordinary Congress of the Socialists, lately held at Bahia Blanca, resulted in a split between the moderates and the &quot; Terceristas,&quot; adherents of the Third International. The policy of the former, who were in a majority, is to conform to the International Cou-stitutiou, and thus &quot; attain to the true doctrine of Socialism.&quot; The leader of the Extremists, Senator del Valle Iberlucea, has been sentenced to i\ years&apos; imprisonment for sedition in connection with his propaganda in favour of the Third International.bolshevik propagandists.Two of the chief propagandists who are fomenting Bolshevism in British, French, and U.S.A. commercial undertakings are said to be Dr. Hans Schrieber and Kurt Klemm. Schrieber is the owner of a German paper published in Santiago ; Klemm travels constantly through the South American countries, Chili receiving special attention. The bulk of the German Argentines are monarchists ; most of their capital is invested in interests, not greatly dependent on labour. The only important exception is that of Delfino Hijos, the only interruption of whose service throughout this year of port strikes ended in a few days
by the free acceptance of the men&apos;s terms. Labour disorder, therefore, docs not reflect on German interests. Well-informed British shipping circles are convinced that Delfino Hijos have been contributing to the F.O.M. Port Strike funds, whicb have been used mainly against British shipping, the interests of which are adversely affected by perpetual disputes.Labour Troubles.The Federacion Obrera Maritima has at last waived its claim to force the Mihanovitch Company to dismiss their Uruguayan employees; on its part the Company has reluctantly agreed to close down the San Fernando shipyards temporarily, with the intention of reopening at a subsequent date with Federated labour. The letter in which the Minister of Public Works demanded that this step, should be taken was described bv &quot; La Nacion &quot; as &quot; of its class, the most subversive document that has been afforded in these times.&quot; This note, the &quot; Nacion &quot; continues, &quot; admits the incapacity of the government to deal with the labour conflicts that have become such common occurrences in every country.&quot; The paper considers it either a counsel of despair or else a deliberate act of favour to the Federation. The Federation is beginning to fear that the lessening demand for labour may prevent their members from finding work elsewhere with their former ease, and therefore welcomes the resumption of work.The closing of some of the Forestal Company&apos;s factories no doubt has contributed to this fear, as well as the recent decision, temporarily postponed, of the Frigorifico &quot; La Blanca&quot; to close down its works owing to the arbitrary Trade Union prohibition of the export of hides.In the case of the &quot; Las Palmas Produce Co.,&quot; where a general strike was declared some time ago, the manager applied personally to the President for the provision of 12 naval stokers to prevent deterioration of their plant. On the plea that such assistance would imply that he was &quot; favouring Capital as against Labour,&quot; the request was refused.The West India Oil Co. has been forced jp accept impossible labour conditions, as it was indicated to them that otherwise their concession might be involved.In spite of the fact that only about two months earlier the Bieckert Brewery Co. granted their men all they demanded, the Brewers&apos; Union were urged in the February issue of &quot; Vida,&quot; the organ of the Communists (F.O.R.A.), to demand a further list of 21 articles. The impossible demands made included one that men are not to be detailed for any work which they disapprove of. The manager has decided to fight the situation.Cafes and restaurants have had their share in the general unrest. Waiters not only bombed six cafes within the course of a week or two, including the head office of the local&quot; Lyons,&quot; but there have been several cases of poisonous substances being placed in the sugar.BRAZIL.Although most of the Anarchists have been deported, propaganda ie going merrily on, and the country is said to be seething. An engineer at the Tramway Power Station at Olinda, Pernambuco, has been endeavour-vouring to obtain photographs and literature from England for Communist propaganda amongst the Russian Colony there.
CHILI.The judge who has been investigating tho case of the raid on the Chilean headquarters of the I.W.W. is reported by the press to have expressed the opinion that the I.W.W. is not an illegal association. He recommended, however, that the Secretary-General and one other member should be sentenced to three years&apos; imprisonment and two others to two years&apos; imprisonment for distributing subversive literature. Ii is now alleged that the late Prefect of Police, Captain Caballero, who is on his way to Rome to take up the post of Military Attache, himself caused the dynamite cartridges which were found on the premises during the raid to be placed there, and also caused the revolutionary pamphlets to be printed in order to be able to adduce incriminating evidence. It is reported that Captain Caballero has been recalled so that the matter may be investigated.
PART II.1. THE LATE COMMUNIST DISTURBANCES IN CENTRAL GERMANY.In the recent disturbances in Central Germany and Hamburg the general political purpose of the Communist International in Western Europe was prematurely discovered. Viewed from the standpoint of the Communist Party in Russia, two factors govern the present situation : first, the danger to itself of the recent concessions to individualism, both as regards the Middle Peasantry and Western Capitalism ; secondly, the necessity to maintain the spirit and solidarity of the Party by an intensification of revolutionary activities abroad.This intensification of activity was, and, indeed (since the purpose is vital, and cannot be abandoned), will continue to take the form of the exploitation of the international and industrial difficulties of Europe. Only in Germany the affair, considered from the purely revolutionary standpoint, which is that of the Soviet government, went off at half cock.Behind the disturbances the most varied influences have been at work. No less than five parties have to be taken into account, with interests variously conflicting, diverging, approaching, coincident, or parallel. There is, in the first place, the executive of the Third Inter national, which stands or falls by the success or failure of the Soviet regime. In the second there is the German Communist Party, with its offshoot the German Communist Labour Party, which has recently enjoyed the favour of Moscow in that, despite its more definitely &quot;National&quot; outlook, it has, under the influence of the parties of the extreme Right, shown itself more inclined to be guided in internal affairs by the Executive Committee of the International at Moscow. Then there is the party of old regime Militarists under von der Goltz and Ludendorff. And, finally, there are the Majority Socialists who constitute the government.Up to a certain point the interests of Moscow, of the German Militarists, and of the Communists of the &quot; Nationalist&quot; Communist Labour Party run parallel, in that they all, for different reasons, desire the maintenance of strong bodies of armed men in Germany. Before the disturbances the Communist Party was accordingly interspersed with informers.and agents provocateurs of the Right national&apos;bodies, which desired to exploit the Communist bogey as an excuse for rejecting the Disarmament Bill and supporting Bavaria in her efforts to retain the Einwohnerwehren. The Communists themselves naturally did not regard the matter in this light. But the Communist Labour Party, as well as Stoecker and the other successors of Paul Levi and Dauemig, of the Communist Party proper, wished to show that zeal on behalf of Moscow in which their predecessors had been found lacking. And Moscow, in pursuance of her general policy of intensifying European unrest, was more than willing to use the instrument so offered.Reliable informants in touch with von der Goltz and Ludendorff, declare that the whole affair was not only the idea of the German Military party, but was also carried out according to their instructions
and as tho result of a sort of formal ultimatum to Moscow, wherein it was stated that no assistance or co-operation could be expected from the Germans unless a plan for the disarmament of the workers was carried out. Authorities in the Communist camp, however, said that Moscow itself had chosen the mode of action, and defended themselves against the charge that Moscow had been guilty of sacrificing the lives of German Communists on the ground that well-informed comrades of the Third International, including Zinovieff and Jiadek, believed that the German Communists would succeed in attracting the rest of the workers to their cause in spite of any efforts made by their leaders to keep them out of the movement.Colour is lent to the contention of von der Goltz that German &apos; militarists incited, or at any rate controlled, the conduct of the dis-turbances by the prominent part played by Max Hoeltz, their agent provocateur.Max Hoeltz was a member of the bomb-outrage gang which worked &apos; in America under the orders of Boy-ed, and left America at the same time as Count Bemsdorf. After Hoeltz&apos;s return to Germany he remained in the employ of the German authorities, and was sent on several occasions in 1917 as secret emissary to Lenin and Trotsky, and also to Kraus in the Ukraine. Later on he was employed as agent de liaison of General. Hoffman&apos;s army in Lithuania. After that he was with Bermondt in Mittau. Just before the Kapp Putsch he was in the camp of Doeberitz with Bischof and Luettwitz, the latter of whom entrusted him with the mission of creating iu Saxony a centre of revolutionary agitation so as to give the German military chiefs a pretext against the disarmament then being imposed by the Entente. After Max Hoeltz had made a great name for himself as a Bolshevik brigand during the Kapp Putsch he escaped to Bohemia. The then Minister of Justice at Prague was himself something not unlike a Bolshevik, and the trial of Hoeltz was a farce.After the failure of tho Putsch, Max Hoeltz succeeded in evading the police, which the Government, acting for the Majority Socialists, had put on his tracks, in a manner which strongly indicates that shelter was provided for him, not only by the comparatively small party of Com-muuists, but by the wider and completer network of organisations acting under the Right National parties. A further proof of the collabora-tiou of the Militarists and Communists appears to lie in the curious fact that, though the record of Max Hoeltz was perfectly known, he was never once denounced as a militarist provocateur by the German Communists, though Paul Levi and many others of the party had been aware that he was a traitor from a period dating shortly after the Kapp Putsch in February 1920. Meanwhile in all the German Conservative papers the comedy of the dangerous biigand chief was staged.How far the Government and Majority Socialists were aware of the coming movement, and turned a blind eye upon the doings of the Mili-tarists with regard to it, appears dubious. It is always difficult to divide the action of the German Government from the action of the old military party, because the Executive still so largely consists of former and indeed of present militarists.Kopp&apos;s indirect participation iu the Putsch seems clear, despite his indignant denials to Herr von Simons. A message intercepted between Kopp and Moscow begs Moscow to intervene on behalf of several Russians whose fate depends U on those who restore order.&quot; &quot; Personally,&quot; he says, &quot; I am unable to do anything for them. Please get into touch with &quot; the German Government at once, through the German representative &quot; (at Moscow) ; otherwise it will be too late.&quot; This seems definitely to prove that, while Kopp was not in a position to approach the German
Government direct, Moscow was in a better position as regards certain of tho servants of that Government. A true statement of the case would appear to be that, while the responsibility of the German Government was not itsolf engaged, officials in its service were working in the joint interests of the Militarists and of Moscow,The impression that the resignation of Paul Levi and the former leaders of the Communist Party was due to direct pressure from Moscow is strongly confirmed by subsequent evidence. Tho fall of these leaders resulted in much confusion in district organisations, their supporters having in many districts also resigned. Levi, Clara Zetkin, Hoffman, and Dauemig declined to carry out the orders of Moscow, and Levi published a scathing pamphlet entitled &quot; Unser Weg,&quot; in which he denounced the whole project, which he has demonstrated to have been framed by men who had no conception of German conditions.Levi&apos;s expulsion from the German Communist Party was followed by his departure for Italy, while Fran Klara Zetkin&apos;s and Adolf Hoffman&apos;s resignation from the International Executive was followed by the depar-ture of one for Switzerland and of the other for Russia. It is not improbable that they and other members of the anti-Putsch element in the Communist movement may succeed in regaining their influence through the failure of the disturbances which they disapproved.Moscow has now definitely arraigned Levi for his insubordination to the party in publishing the pamphlet &quot; Unser Weg &quot; a step which should tend to widen the breach. It would appear, in fact, that Moscow stands to lose in the Avhole affair. She does not even hold the extremists of the Communist Labour Party, the more absolutely Nationalist wing of which, known as the Hamburg Opposition Group, came out with a strong declaration against the authors of the Putsch. The action of Moscow in provoking the disturbance has therefore definitely alienated, on the one hand, the elders and betters of the Communist Party, and, on the other, the extreme Nationalists of the Communist Labour Party, at a time when its purposes and its situation alike required the maintenance of unity among the adherents to the Third International in Germany. The affair has not been Avithout internal effects in Russia. Certain leaders, notably Tchit-cherin, though Lenin dissented, had banked on the success of the disturbance and hoped to be able to attack Lithuania and Poland about the middle of April. The event badly shook Tchitcherin&apos;s position, and in Bolshevik circles they are already naming his successor.2. AFTER KRONSTADT: THE POLICY OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT AND THE SOCIAL REVOLUTIONARIES.The following extracts from an article by Karl Radek, the former agent of&quot; the Communist International in Berlin, are of interest as illustrating the attitude of the Soviet Government and the &quot; advanced &quot; Social Revolutionaries towards the situation created by the peasant risings in Russia, with which that of Kronstadt is now identified. It shows the determination of the Communist Party to maintain its leadership, until the revolution in Western Europe is achieved, in the face of the cry for a real Government of Soviets to represent the Russian people.The Kronstadt revolt was more than a local event, though it had its rn local features.   The revolt was caused only in a minor degree by
material needs. While the disaffection of the sailors was mainly due to their opposition to the discipline imposed upon them by the Soviet Government, it was due also to the fact that the crews had ceased to be recruited from Finlaud and the Baltic Provinces, which have passed out of the hands of Soviet Russia. With the exception of a few veterans the new crews were recruited only from the South of Russia and from the Black Sea coast. The majority of the sailors manning the fleet, therefore, consisted of peasants from the Ukraine.Generally, it may be said that the revolt was, in the first place, the expression of the discontent of the Ukrainian peasant. The sailors, after the breakdown of the policy of intervention, had gone home on furlough. At home they had learnt that the threat of White intervention had ceased, and at the same time heard complaints from all sides about the Government requisitions of food products. They learnt also of the struggle carried on by the Soviet Government against Machnov and his baud. Some of the sailors, indeed, never returned from their furlough, while others joined the insurgents under Machnov.No less than four members of the Committee which headed the Kronstadt revolt were peasant youths from the Ukraine. The peasant of the Ukraine, believing that the danger of the return of the landlord is already over, demands that the burden of duties imposed upon him by the Soviet GoA^erument shall be lightened. This undisciplined turn of mind appealed to the peasant youth kept on board ship at Kronstadt under discipline ; he had come to look upon Communist sailors and Communists in general as persons exacting a discipline and subordination no longer necessary in the absence of enemy ships before Kronstadt. To him these Communists were the same people Avho Avere depriving the Ukrainian peasants of their crops.The Kronstadt sailor, hoAvever, is a revolutionist opposed to the return of the land-owner and capitalist. He did not himself see his protest at Kronstadt in a counter-revolutionary light. He looked upon it as a furtherance of the October revolution, now directed against the Central Executive of the Communist Government. &quot;It was Ave Avho brought about the revolution,&quot; he said. &quot; It was Ave who proclaimed the motto &quot; of &apos; All the Power to the Soviets,&apos; which should, therefore, exercise &quot; power and represent the masses as a whole, and not the Communist &quot; party alone, as is the case to-day. We must create a real Soviet &quot; poAver.&quot;This protest had the more force as it coincided with discussions within the Communist Party itself regarding the parasitic bureaucracy which Avas clearly choking it, and the necessity for clearing the party from place-seekers discussions which gave scope to all the anarchical elements opposed to centralisation and bureaucracy. All these tended towards the adoption of a single watcliAvord : the re-election of the Soviets on the basis of freeing them from the influence of the Commuuist or any other Party. A section of the workers in Kronstadt were attracted to this movement on its syndicalist side, which to them meant the taking over of the factories and appropriation of their products.Of this frame of mind the avowed counter-revolutionaries and monarchists took advantage. Matters Avere brought to a conflict by provocation either on the part of the Socialist Revolutionaries or on the part of the Monarchists. White Guard Elements from Finland endeavoured to establish communication Avith Kronstadt. The leaders of the mutiny assured the sailors that in a few days the Soviet govern-ment would be compelled to arrange for the re-election of the Soviets throughout Russia, and that a non-party Government, giving equality of rights to all classes, would be the result.   The peasants, they Avere told,O  AS 8841 F
would no longer have to give up their corn, aud the workers would no longer go hungry. The sailors in Kronstadt, iu fact, rose with the slogan for real Soviets, accompanied with that of &quot;Down with the Communists.&quot;Now, what may he called the Left Wing of the counter-revolutionaries outside Russia, the parties represented by Miliukov and Savinkov, are convinced that the defeat of Denikin, Koltchak, and the others was due to the fact that, as representatives of the Russian Junkers, they repelled the peasants. The counter-revolutionary movement, as they believe, can only be successful when it springs from within and appears to be free from feudal tendencies. Miliukov has, however, gone further : he recog-recognises that the demand for the Constituent Assembly has no attractions for the peasant, the workman, or the soldier of the Red Army. Provided he can get rid of the Communists, Miliukov is prepared to accept the slogan of a &quot; real Soviet Government,,&quot; for, in the event of the fall of the Communist Party, there falls also the only power in Soviet Russia which has led the struggle against world capital, the only power which is capable now, providing it has peace, of carrying out the economic recon-struction of the country. Miliukov&apos;s organ, the &quot; Posledini Novosti,&quot; in a dispute with a doctrinaire Socialist Revolutionary, goes so far as to defend the Soviets, not only as organs of administration, but also as organs of State power. &quot; The Soviets are not merely consultative or &quot; legislative organs, but the organ of State power as a whole; only as &quot; such can they take the place of the State power of the Bolsheviks ; &quot; only as such can they be the starting point for the building up of a &quot; regular organisation in the provinces, which can maintain contact with &quot; the people. It is, of course, understood that after they have per-formed this temporary function they will be re-elected.&quot; (&quot; Posledini Novosti,&quot; March 18th.)The Communist Party, on the other hand, hold that the cry of tho Kronstadt sailors for a real Soviet power, adopted successively by the Kronstadt sailors and the party of Miliukov, means, if not the destruction, at least the enfeeblement of Russia for an indefinite period. Soviets without Communists Avi 11 represent the wavering, disunited, exhausted workers, and will be compelled to allow the bourgeois forces, which the Communist Soviet Government now bends to its service and controls, to operate without any control at all. The Communist Party of Russia is sufficiently elastic to foil the counter-revolutionary plan to get rid of the Soviet Government by rousing the petty bourgeois, peasant, and semi-proletarian classes against the Communist Party under the cry of securing a genuine Soviet Government. It will foil this plan, and will strengthen its relation with the peasants, by undertaking the reduction of the Red Army and lessening the burdens of the peasantry, and, at the same time, by using industry and foreign trade for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of the peasants, so attracting the &quot; backward &quot; workers in the ranks of the Communist Party.Meanwhile, the Party, both in view of the internal and in view of the external situation, must close its ranks. The West European prole-tariat are weighing up the differences between the Communist Party and the section of the Communist movement which believes that the Russian dictatorship of that party should be opposed by the dictatorship of the mass of the whole of the working class.*There must be a strong, centralised Communist Party determined for a certain.period, if the conditions of the struggle do not improve, and the temper of the masses in Europe does not rise, to retain power as a Party representing the revolutionary minority.* I.e., by democracy,
The emancipation itself of the working class can only, it is true, be the task of the fighting&apos;majority of the proletariat. But, in the struggle for emancipation, circumstances may arise in which the revolutionary minority of the working class must take the whole burden of the struggle upon its own shoulders, and in which dictatorship of the proletariat must temporarily take the form of the dictatorship of the Communist Party.3 A SOVIET DELEGATE IN THE MIDDLE EAST.The following extracts from a letter from Theodore Rothstein, formerly secret agent of the Soviet Government in London, and now the head of the Soviet Delegation to Persia, were written at Askabad (Poltoratsk) on March 15th. It is quoted as giving an intimate and, in its own wa,y, an impartial picture of conditions in the Russian East.&quot; To-mprrow will be exactly three Aveeks since we left Moscow ; snoAv drifts gave me pause when I Avas entering Asia between Orenburg and the Sea of Aral, and iioav they are impeding my journey into Persia, because the roads are snowed up from the frontier to Teheran. I have journeyed through the Avhole of the Russian East Tashkent, Samarkand, Bokhara, and Merv, and I am now in the territory principally populated by Turcomans.&quot; A letter is not exactly the place to describe my political impressions in detail. I can only say that while, even in these remote parts, the Soviet Power has taken deep root, here, even more than at the Centre, it is suffering from the want of qualified and honest Avorkers. One man is obliged to act in several capacities. He is surrounded by men given to sabotage, by unemployed, crypto-bourgeois, and speculators, and the rest of the riff-raff, of Avbom he has to make use for the want, so far, of the right kind of men. That is why the apparatus is far from perfect, and the economic programme must be put into force very gradually and with omissions, leaving a place for and not interfering with the local commerce in the form of native bazaars and Russian markets.&quot; In spite of this, hoAvever, the Power is strong, and the submission of the natives, and also of the colonists, is absolutely indisputable. Nor would it be at all true to say that this submission has been forced. There is a consciousness amongst the native masses, shown in their fight with Douton and the other White Guard adventurers, that submission is necessary for their own interests. &quot; &quot;We, on our side, are trying to influence these native masses to take their part in this Power and in the government of the country, in spite of the timidity of the said masses and of their unprepared condition. The whole Government in Bokhara consists of Bokhar Communists. These people are, it is true, rather soft. But for all that they are sensible, and, if they err, do so by excessive striving to show their independence with regard to Soviet Russia. Our representative in Bokhara is on the same footing as in a foreign country, but he never dreams of acting the role of a Resident in the accepted sense of the Avord.&quot; In Samarkand and even in Tashkent the power as much as possible is given over into the hands of the natives, who by this means get to understand the advantages of Soviet organisation despite the burden of economic conditions. Here, in Ashabad, the Russian element prevails, as the Turcomans are still unable to show up their intelligent men, and 0  AS 8841 G
tho majority of-them are absolute barbarians. But thoy also have Soviets, and, as far as in their power lies, are attracted to tho local work.&quot; We are to a great extent cut off from Moscow here, but I imagine that there things are going on in the same old way. We expected further risings in the spring on the grounds of the food crisis, and even more because of the Sowing Company, which is not exactly to the taste of the Kodaks, (small profiteering peasant merchants), so that the Kroustadt events and the peasants&apos; riots in different parts of the South and in Siberia were not unexpected. All these and other incidents had beenforeseen, not only by politicians, but by the administrative Power, and measures were consequently taken to destroy all this at the root, both politically and morally. I can just imagine what is said about this in the English press, and how the enemies of the trade agreement with us will profit by the sensation to its full extent and to their own advantage. Once again they will be bitterly disappointed. A few months will pass, and in the autumn we shall not only have settled all these disturbances and plots, but we will come out of this economic crisis on to a broad path, whore conspiracies and peasant profiteers&apos; riots will be no longer4. CHINESE RELATIONS WITH RUSSSIA.While Krassin has been working to break down commercial isolation in the West, Youriu has been working as assiduously in the East. His aim has been to secure the recognition by China of the Far Eastern Republic, and through that recognition to open up avenues of trade and propaganda. Rebuffs and shadows of success have alternated, until China finally asked assurances as a preliminary to a possible re-establish-ment of trade. Immunity from Bolshevik propaganda, protection of Chinese interests in Russia, and various matters connected with railways and old treaty rights were demanded. Yourin is now digesting the latest rebuff in his. endeavour to further Sovietism by the trade route.As long ago as October 2nd of last year the Commissariat of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Soviet Republic would appear to haAre handed to Mr. Chang Sze ling, described by the Soviet as diplomatic and military representative of the Chinese Republic, a note for transmission to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, intimating the terms on which Russia would resume relatious with China. It should be noted that Chang Sze-ling&apos;s mission in Moscow appears to be of an unofficial character. The note in question details and enlarges the terms for a Russo-Chinese treaty, which were outlined in the &quot; Appeal to the Chinese Government and People,&quot; published in China early in 1920. The Soviet proposes to renounce all treaties concluded between the Tsarist Governments and China, and to return unconditionally to China all rights, concessions, and leased territories acquired either&apos; by Russian capitalists or by the Tsarist Governments in China; that the two countries shall, as far as possible, restore their former economic and.commercial relatious, and conclude a special treaty upon most-favoured-nation principles ; that the Chinese Government shall engage itself to render no support to anti-revolutionary persons or organisations, and to prevent them from using Chinese territory as bases of operations against the Soviet Government. A reciprocal engagement&apos;to expel from their territories persons or organisations found plotting against the -safety of their respective countries is also to be made between tho two countries. In addition Russians in China are to be subject to-Chinese laws, and Chinese iu Russia to Russian laws ; - Ohiha% to expel all self-constituted

It is considered that China is not likely to engage upon serious negotiations until one of the Powers has given her lead, or until definite aggression on the part of Russia has obliged her to move.
