SECRET.CP. 2964. JH^ \THE CABINET.ireland and the general military situation.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.The position of the military forces in Ireland is anything but satisfactory. 79There is a risk that a position of virtual stalemate may continue throughout the Irish summer and autumn and that winter will be a time of decisive advantage to the rebels.     760Officers and men have had little or no rest there is no back area into which they can be withdrawn. The discipline and morale of the troops are excellent at present, but many have but one or two nights a we3k in bed ; fatigue and discomfort and the necessity for constant vigilance will not be without effect.I am anxious, therefore, to reinforce the troops in Ireland with everything not actually required elsewhere, so that an endeavour should be made to break the back of the rebellion during the three months, July. August and September.The members elected to the Southern Parliament have to take the oath before the 14th July. Preparation can be made in advance so as not to waste the weather, for immediate declaration of martial law and increased military activities to commence after the 14th July if the members fail to take the oath.The number of troops available depends upon what can be spared from commitments elsewhere, so I will review briefly the disposition of the troops and the prospects of the various theatres where they are engaged.Geeat Britain.I assume that before operations are extended in Ireland the strike will be settled, the Defence Force and the Reserves being demobilized. There will be in Great Britain Infantry, Guards        ......   10 Battalions.Infantry, Line   .........   25 Battalions.Cavalry.........      ...    9 Regiments (of which 3 are HouseholdCavalry).Of these, however, 1 Guard and 7 Line Battalions will be Irish Battalions not available for Ireland.If things have settled down and there is peace at home, we can carry on with (including the Guards Regiments and Battalions) 6 Cavalry Regiments and 17 Infantry Battalions, leaving a surplus of 3 Cavalry Regiments and 18 Infantry Battalions for other duties.But there are other liabilities which must be met, unless by a policy of contraction we can reduce them.The Rhine and Uppee Silesia.We have 4 Battalions on the Rhine, which are under orders for Upper Silesia.The Korfanty rebels are said to number 60,000. The French have 10,000 troops, the Italians, 4,000. Our 4 Battalions with some Artillery, &amp;c, will not exceed 2,500 3,000 ; it seems to me too small a force to launch on such a sea of trouble ; it cannot stand alone, and at present the French seem more likely to support the Poles than to support us, and we may find ourselves acting with Germans against Poles, more or less actively assisted by the French.-If we send these 4 Battalions to Silesia we are engaging in a commitment, the size of which it is impossible to forecast. The only supports available will be those which we now contemplate shall be used in Ireland and, perhaps, it may become necessary to withdraw troops now in Ireland.(B21/198)   100  5/21   H&amp;s, Ltd.  9226-two
Constantinople and Ismid.We have 1 Cavalry Regiment, 2 British Infantry Battalions and 4 Indian Infantry Battalions around Constantinople. A Greek Division is on the Ismid Peninsula. The Greek Government is, according to a telegram No. 256 of the 19th May from Athens, about to ask us to increase our forces so as to protect the Christians in the Ismid Peninsula when the Greek Division is withdrawn for the forthcoming attack on the Turks.I hope we shall not agree. But the position is sufficiently precarious. If the Greek attack fails, we may be face to face with victorious Turkish troops, and if we had troops available, prudence would require reinforcements being sent without delay.General Harington is now at home to confer upon the matter, and I hope within a few days to be able to define the position more precisely.There is one British Battalion at Malta available for the Middle East.Egypt.There are 1 British Cavalry Regiment, 7 British Infantry Battalions, with Artillery, &amp;c, total, about 8,000 all ranks, and in addition 4 Indian Infantry Battalions and 2 Indian Cavalry Regiments.No further reduction can be made until the outlook is more settled. No improvement can be expected until after the coming conference in London in June next, and until whatever decisions are reached have been accepted, and put in force in Egypt.   Meanwhile, there is plenty of opportunity for the extremists to cause trouble.The 7th Dragoon Guards have been kept in Egypt instead of going to Constanti-nople to relieve the 20th Hussars, who should be sent home for disbandment.Palestine.I assume that the 3 British Cavalry Regiments and the 2 British Infantry Battalions with Artillery, &amp;c, total about 4,000, and the Indian troops, total about 1,500, will suffice.Mesopotamia and Persia.The forces are being reduced in the first instance to 1 British and 1 Indian Cavalry Regiment, 4 British and 19 Indian Infantry Battalions, Artillery, &amp;c, total about 28,000. This reduction is opportune, in that it has allowed 2 British Infantry Battalions to be transferred to Egypt.If the situation permits, further reductions will be made in the- autumn which will release 2 more British Infantry Battalions.Subject, therefore, to possible further requirements for Constantinople and Upper Silesia, there is a surplus on the basis stated of 3 Cavalry Regiments and 18 Infantry Battalions available to reinforce the troops in Ireland.I am strongly impressed by the advice of my military advisers that there is grave risk of failure unless full advantage is taken of the opportunities of the good weather of the summer months greatly to intensify our efforts in Ireland. I therefore recommend  &apos;(1.) That the  Cabinet now decide that in the event of a nominatedGovernment being set up in Southern Ireland, martial law should beproclaimed over the whole of its area. (2.) That drives and other similar intensive operations should be inaugurated. (3.) That the Navy should blockade the ports and prevent gun-running and movement of Irish Republican Array troops. (4.) That the additional forces available should be put under the command ofthe General Officer Commanding in Ireland. (5.) That the position at Constantinople should be reviewed at an early date.L. W.-E.24th May, 1921.
