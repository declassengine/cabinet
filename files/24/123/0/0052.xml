The treaty of Versailles lays down, in the annex to article 88, that the solution is to be based on the wishes of the inhabitants, to ascertain which a vote is to be taken by communes;   and that the frontier is to be fixed on the basis of such a vote, subject to geographical and economic considera-tions.2.    The result of the plebiscite has not been such as to justify the allocation of the entire province to either claimant, and a division is there-fore necessary.    The treaty does not afford clear guidance for such a division.    Hence a difference of opinion has arisen, and the members of the Plebiscite Commission have not been able to agree unanimously upon the frontier line to be recommended to
&apos;*!      *.      f./(2).to the allied Governments.3.    It is however possible to narrow down the issue by adopting, for part of the problem, a solution which is clearly indicated by the voting.    A compact mass of communes covering the districts west of the Oder, and certain northern districts, voted German by considerable majorities, the number of votes being approximately 318,000 German against 64,000 Polish. -This should remain German.4.    Similarly in the south, the communes corn-prised in the districts of Pless and Rybnik gave a preponderatingly Polish vote, also by large majorities, the numbers (if a small portion of Ratibor district east of the Oder be added, as for topographical reasons it must be) being 118,000 Polish, against 57,000 German votes.    These districts should there-fore go to Poland.5.    The remaining portion of Upper Silesia consists of numerous sparsely populated Polish rural communes, in which is embedded a small number of important and populous towns with large German majorities.    These townsi with their immediate sur-roundings, constitute together the &quot;industrial area&quot; of Upper Silesia, where urban and rural communes are so closely intermingled that it is impossible to separate them without destroying the economic, life of the whole area and of each of its constituent parts.    The industrial area thus forms an enclave within a ring of outer communes, which voted Polish (by very slight majorities), and the whole difficultyarises
arises from the impossibility of tracing any practical frontier line, if ail the communes which have Polish majorities are to be allotted to Poland and all those with German majorities are to remain German.6,    We are consequently thrown back on the stipulation of the treaty which authorizes the introduction of geographic and economic considera-tions.    It being admitted - as it is admitted on all sides - that economically the industrial area cannot be split up, and that therefore the simple test of counting the votes cast in each commune cannot, in this case, determine the fate of its inhabitants, some other test must be sought.    It seems to His Majesty*s Government both equitable in itself, and most closely in accord with the spirit of the treaty, to look, for the decisive factor, to the totals of the Polish and German populations within the industrial area as a whole, or, in other words, to treat this agglomeration of urban and rural communes as one commune for the purpose of ascertaining the wishes of the population.    The respective figures are, ap-proximately 275,000 Germans against 233,000 Poles, showing therefore a decided German majority.7.    It is by this reasoning that His Majesty!s Government, taking as a basis the scheme proposed by the British and Italian Plebiscite Commissioners, who are in accord, have reached the conclusion that, if the spirit of the treaty is to apply, the industrial area should fall to Germany, together with the large northern and western areas which voted solidly German by -large
large majorities.8.    The remainder, that is Pless and Rybnik with the part of Ratibor situated east of the Oder, as well as the districts immediately to the north of the industrial area which.in general also voted Polish, though only by small majorities, should be assigned to Poland, so far as this can be done without destroy-ing the important railway communication between the industrial area and Germany.9.    The solution favoured by the French Commission-er is to restrict Germany to the compact area to the west and north, where the German vote was in the majority, and to cede all the rest to Poland.    The line of argument by which this solution is recommended appears to be that the region so ceded to Poland would consist of a large and connected group of communes, which voted polish, with only a few German communes interspersed, and that this, according to the treaty, should be decisive, since it is impossible, geographically, to pick cut the comparatively small number of German communes from the surrounding mass, which, in virtus of their Polish majorities, are rightly claimed by Poland.10.    There are two fallacies underlying this argument.    In the first place, in the industrial area - the more populous part of the whole area which the French scheme would give to Poland - it is true that there are more communes with a Polish than with a German majority.    But the aggregate German vote in the industrial area exceeds the aggregate Polishvote
vote by 42,000.    In the second place, the French scheme, In-order to arrive at a numerical majority of votes over the whole area which it is proposed to give to Poland, applies a surplus Polish majority of 62,000 in Pless and Rybnik (the southern predominantly Polish districts) to neutralise a German majority of 46,000 in the remainder of the area, exclusive of Pless and Rybnik.     If this line of reasoning be admitted, it cannot in equity be ruled out when the German claim to the whole plebiscite area is con-sidered.    Applied to the German claim, this reason-ing would give the following result.    A surplus German majority of 253,000 in the country west of the Oder would neutralise a polish majority of 15,000 in the remainder of the plebiscite area, and would in fact give a larger percentage majority than is yielded by the same system when applied to the Franco-polish  claim.11,    When these fallacies are exposed, and the essentially Polish districts (Pless and Rybnik) are excluded, we arrive at the situation which, as shown above, leads to the allocation of the industrial area to Germany.    Taking the whole province together, there is of course a large majority of German communes (844 as against 678 Polish, corresponding roughly to the total votes cast, namely German 7 07,6 05, Polish 479,359).12.    The general effect of the British and Italian proposal would be that, in the part allotted to Germany there would be a majority of65
65 per cent of Germans, and in the part allotted to Poland, a majority of 63 per cent of Poles - as fair a division as could he hoped for under any scheme of division.    The French plan, on the other hand, would give a German majority of 86 per cent in the German part, hut a Polish majority of only 51 per cent in the Polish part, clearly a, less satisfactory result.13,    As regards the economic aspect, the French scheme allots the entire mineral wealth to Poland, hut subject to the condition that Poland assumes a proportionate share of the German reparation burden and submits to interallied control of the area for a term of years.    Such a bargain hardly conforms to the spirit of the treaty, and is of more than doubtful benefit to Poland, although the French Government state that Poland has agreed to it. The British and Italian scheme allots the bulk of the present.output of coal (85%) to Germany;   but the reserves of the German sphere will be worked out in 50 years, whereas the Polish sphere has reserves at the present rate of output for centuries to come.    The present output of the Polish sphere under the Anglo-Italian scheme is approximately 7,000,000 tons yearly.    The German sphere has very little coking coal, and is dependent upon the Polish sphere for fuel for foundries.    Consequently the ruinous boycott by Germany which would most probably result from the allocation of the entire industrial area to Poland, is not anticipated.    Such allocation would, moreover, result in a wholesale exodus ofthe
the skilled workmen, who are practically all German, and may therefore he expected to opt for Germany. If they so opt they must transfer themselves to &apos; Germany within 12 months, under article 3 of the treaty between the Powers and Poland of June 28th, 1919.    It is understood that the French Government think it possible to replace the German experts by Frenchmen, but this in our opinion is quite im-practicable.
