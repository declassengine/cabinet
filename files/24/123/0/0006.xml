CABINET.GUARDS MEMORIAL IN ST. JAMES!S PARK.MEMORANDUM EY THE FIRST C 0:X US:: ION LR OF WOHKS.Sir Alfred Mondrs suggestion, CP .2643, that the Guards Memorial should be placed in St. james Park opposite the Horse Gua.&quot;p^ Archway, was discussed on March the 24th and adjourned.   I agree with ray predecessor that the Cabinet should be invited to endorse the scheme.It certainly contains elements of controversy, for it introduces a new monument into the Park and involves the removal of certain troes and the diversion of the existing road.On the other hand, the proposal has otvious merits, for it actually increac3S the grass area within the Park itself and makes possible the grass lawns opposite tho India Office and Foroign Office, about f acre in extent.   Many of the trees to be removed (some forty six in number) are wretched root-bound specimens, and will be replaced by eighty young trees.   Finally, the scheme provides a dignified site for the Memorial of a famous Division.The outlay on roads, fencing and re-planting, will amount to at least  22,500 a large proportion of which could be appropriately charged to the Unemployment Grant allotted to my Department.Parliamentary assent is necessary.   I Invite an early ruling by the Cabinet for all progress on the Guards Memorial is suspended until the site is determined.(Intld.) C &amp; -B..M.0fflce of Works, &apos;  4th May, 1921,S,W,1,SECRET. CP. 2904
