In his memorandum of the 27th May (CP. 2982), the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposes to accept the view that the earnings Of enemy ships, captured in a port in India or a Dominion, and the ships themselves (if condemned as prize), should become the property of the Government in whose territory the port was situated, but to claim (1.) That in cases in which the British Government hired such ships from the Government of India or a Dominion Government, hire money should not be paid, or,should be refunded if it has already been paid.(2.) That the British Government should not pay compensation for ships, so hired and sunk while in their service.It is not denied that in law the Imperial Exchequer is entitled to the ships (which are &quot; droits of Admiralty&quot;), in view of the provisions of section 8 (I) of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890. But section 8 (2) empowers His Majesty by Order in Council to direct that droits condemned by a court in a British possession shall form part of the revenues of that possession; and it has been argued on, behalf of the Colonial Office and the India Office that section 8 (2) should be applied in the present instance, more especially in view of the constitutional relations now existing between the constituent parts of the British Empire. The Treasury now in effect accepts this contention ; but although thus admitting that ships captured in Indian ports should be treated as belonging to India, claim, in my opinion, some vhat arbitrarily, that Imperial revenues should be relieved of all liabilities in respect of the use of such ships by the British. Government.The estimated present value of the surviving ships is less than. 1,000,000 . The amount received from the British Government as net hire is estimated at d-oI-,000Z., and the value of the ships sunk while in the service of the British Government was about 42O,000L Thus while the British Treasury are now conceding the ships to India they are in fact claiming that India should repay to them money already received, nearly equal to half the value of the ships, and in addition should waive a claim for about the same amount, Avhich rests logically on as strong a basis as the claim to the ships.Against this statement of the case it may be argued thai it leaves out of account the fact that the Treasury offer to leave to India the amount of the earnings of the ships apart from what was earned while they were in the employment of the British Government. But the earnings of the ships are not &quot; droits of Admiralty&quot; like the ships themselves, and it is not admitted that the British Treasury have a legal right to the earnings of the ships.4055     100  5.21
I am advised that I cannot by law accept any proposal in this matter-without the approval of the Council of India, and I understand that the view adopted by the British Cabinet is to be laid before the Imperial Cabinet for a final decision. If the British Cabinet should adopt the proposal of the Treasury without any modification I should find some difficulty in asking my Council to authorise the representatives of India at the Imperial Cabinet to agree to it. The matter appears, however, to be one that cannot be con-clusively adjusted oh any logical basis, and I suggest that a compromise is indicated. Treating the matter from the practical standpoint it cannot well be ignored that sums amounting to about 434,0007. have been in fact paid from the British Treasury to India for the hire of these ships; and it is a more serious matter for the financial authorities of India to be called on, at a time of difficulty, to refund money already received, than to forgo claims that have not previously been conceded. I suggest therefore that India should retain the money already paid by the British Government for hire and should forgo compensation for the ships sunk while in the services of the British Government.I do not wish to raise any objection to anything in the Treasury memorandum apart from the points dealt with in the preceding paragraphs.If a compromise on these lines is agreed to I shall be prepared to press the Council of India to adopt it, and with their support to co-operate with the British Government in getting the compromise confirmed by the Imperial Cabinet.E. S. M.  .30th May 1921.
