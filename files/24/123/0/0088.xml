SECRET.CP. 2981.THE CABINET.the military situation in turkey.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate for urgent consideration a note by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff covering appreciations by General Harington and the General Staff of the position in Turkey.L. W.-E.The War Office, 26th May, 1921.Secretary of State,I put up two short notes on the Turco-Greek situation : A. Is an appreciation by the General Staff. B. Is an appreciation by General Harington.In the main I agree with both these papers : that is to say, that I think the chances are that the Turks will drive the Greeks back on to Smyrna, and quite likely Out of Smyrna too, and that our troops in Constantinople will be in danger. Nor in such a case can I see any possibility of holding the Dardanelles. In short, I think we ought now to take the necessary steps to withdraw, and to withdraw completely, both from the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles.Henry Wilson, Field-Marshal,Chief of the Imperial General Staff.26th May, 1921.a.The Military Situation in Turkey, 20th May, 1921.1. The recent failure of the Greek Army in Anatolia makes it advisable to review the military situation again, with the object of seeing how it is likely to affect the Allied position in Constantinople generally and that of the British troops in particular.2. The strength and dispositions of the Greek and Nationalist forces at the present time are given below: (a.) Greek. (i.) Brusa front.- v Fighting strength.3 Divisions, 1 Cavalry Brigade, and Corps Troops,&quot;Brusa area   ......      ............V    20,0001 Division in Adabazar area......      ......,(ii.) Ushak front.-4 Divisions and Corps Troops......      ......      18,500(iii.) Reserve and Lines of Communication. 1 Division and 4 Regiments........      ....      8,500Total fighting strength ..........      47,000and 254 guns.(B21/202)  100  6/21  H&amp;S, Ltd.  9230wo
(6.) Turkish Nationalists. (i.) Brusa front. 6 Divisions, 1 Cavalry Division       ......      ...      17,000(ii.) Ushak front. 9 Divisions, 3 Cavalry Divisions      ......      ...      26,500(iii.) Possibly moving from Ciljcia 2 Divisions     .................. 6,700(iv.) reserve at Argora. Recruits and Gendarmerie    ...      .....,      ...       10,000Total fighting strength  ..........       60,2003. On the 19th February, 1921, when the General Staff Paper * entitled &quot;The Military Situation in Russia, Caucasia, Turkey and Greece&quot; was circulated to the Cabinet, the maximum fighting strength which could be employed by the Greeks and Turks in Western Anatolia was estimated as follows : Greek fighting troops ...      ...      ...      ...      ...   80,000Turkish Nationalist fighting troops ...      ...      ......   40,0004. A comparison of the figures given in paragraphs 2 and 3 shows that, whereas before the recent operations the Greeks were in a superiority of about 2 to 1, the picture is now completely changed, and the Turks are actually stronger in numbers by some 13,000.Even with the superiority they formerly possessed, the Greeks failed in their recent attack; and there appears to be no prospect whatever that they will be able to put into the field, and maintain, sufficient numbers to enable them to take the offensive against the Turks with success. Although the Greek Government still publish abroad that they are sending reinforcements to their army, and that they hopa shortly to raise its strength to a sufficient standard to deal the Turks a decisive blow, we know from secret and other sources that there is little chance of this happening; and, moreover, we know that the Greek Army and Government are seriously considering the possibility of being compelled to withdraw, not only to the Smyrna Enclave, but even out of Anatolia altogether.Secret sources of information also tell us that the Turks are little inferior to the Greeks in guns and munitions, and that there is no prospect that the Greeks will be able to prevent them from replenishing their supplies and ammunition from Russian sources.5. From the above it appears certain that the initiative is almost certain to pass from the Greeks to the Turks, and that the latter will probably attack at no distant date.   The initial courses open to the Turks are (a.) To concentrate the bulk of their forces for an attack on the Smyrna Enclave, leaving detachments to hold the remainder of the line to the Black Sea, until they have disposed of the Greek Army covering Smyrna.(b.) To leave sufficient forces on the Southern front to keep the Greek forces in that area occupied, and to use the remainder of the army to advance on the Bosphorus, or masking the Ismid Peninsula move on Chanak and the southern shores of the Dardanelles.6. It is impossible to say which alternative the Turks will adopt, but it appears that the vital area to the Greeks is the Smyrna Enclave, and it is therefore extremely probable that the Greeks will. decide to concentrate all their available resources to face the danger which threatens Smyrna, thus leaving the approaches to the Bosphorus uncovered, and probably also those from Brusa to the Dardanelles. The probability that this line of action will&quot; be taken by the Greeks is borne, out by secret information, which we are receiving, that they are already contemplating the transfer of the 11th (Manissa) Division from the Ismid area, and are asking the Allied troops to take over the defence of that area. ; ;   ..f 7. It is difficult to assess the maximum forces which the Turks will be able to spare from the operations against Smyrna, to. advance into the Ismid Peninsula&apos;, but if they decide&apos; on a defensive attitude in the southern area it is reasonable to suppose that they* CP. 2608,&apos; dated 19th February; 1921.
-would be content with an equality of force there. This would leave them, for operations in the Ismid Peninsular, some 13,000 men, plus any additional troops that they could bring up from the Sivas area, or could spare from the French front in Cilicia. If an operation on this scale were launched, it would not be wise for the small Allied force now in Constantinople to attempt to oppose it east, of the Beikos-Maltepe line,, and as this line is almost on the shores of the Bosphorus, a very difficult situation would thus be created for the Allies in Constantinople.In any case, the withdrawal of the Greek troops from Brusa and Ismid will leave the British troops face to face with the Nationalists. If our position is to be secured on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus, it is estimated that a force of 2 Allied Divisions would be required, plus&apos; extra troops to cope with local sympathetic troubles which must certainly be expected in Thrace and in and around Constantinople itself.8. In this paper no mention has been made of a possible Bolshevik attack on Roumania during the summer. There are indications that such an attack is possible; and it is unnecessary to enlarge on the danger to Constantinople that would result if a Bolshevik attack from the north was made at. the same time as a Nationalist advance from the south-east.9. Taking all the above facts into consideration, the General Staff adhere to the opinion previously expressed.* that His Majesty&apos;s Government must be prepared to adopt one of the following three courses : (a.) To send reinforcements to Constantinople. (6.) To withdraw the existing British troops, (c.) To readjust the Allied policy.The first course is at present out of the question. The third policy is, of course, political, and it does not lie within the province of the General Staff to express an opinion, but it would seem that it is too late to effect any change of policy that would be acceptable to all parties, or that could be enforced without additional Allied troops.This being so, the General Staff believe that it is imperative that the british troops now in Constantinople should be withdrawn before they become involved in a! dangerous situation owing to a Nationalist advance.It is fully realized that such a withdrawal would have an adverse effect on our political and commercial interests in Constantinople and the Middle East, but at the same time it is considered that, any delay may lead to serious consequences from a-military point of view.b.Chief of the Imperial General Staff, .       &apos;1. The Secretary of State has asked me for a note to submit to tne Cabinet giving my views of the situation at Constantinople.    * &apos;I have read the General Staff paper which has been submitted to you and I am in entire agreement therewith.i he picture has been completely reversed during the last 6 months.When I went there to assume command the Greeks were in the field contented and organized, the Kemalists were merely a troublesome factor and contained some 15,000 effectives on their western front.To-day, owing to changed circumstances, bad leading and reverses, the Greeks&apos;, can no longer be termed an efficient force, whereas the Kemalists have become, an army of 13 Divisions on the western front buoyed up with success, and form a serious factor.Mustapha Kemal, urged on by the extremists, is intensely bitter against the English, whom he accuses of helping the Greeks and is, in my opinion, intent on his avowed policy of pushing the Allies off Turkish soil.2. Any idea of coming to terms with Mustapha has now passed. In my opinion, if we now hold out a hand to Mustapha he would reject it with scorn.3. I do not want to strike any note of alarm, and that is why I have come home for a few days to report to you personally on the military situation.I have done everything in my power to keep the various nations at Constantinople quiet, and the town itself for which I am responsible. We have so far dealt successfully with the various plots and unruly elements, hungry Russians, and Turks, &amp;c, and I have nothing but praise for the patience displayed.      . &quot;   &quot;.&apos;: * CP. 2608, dated 19th February, 1921.(9230)
4; The last few weeks, however, shows a changing picture as follows&quot;(a.) The increase of brigandage, burning and looting; both on the European and Asiatic sides, is serious.   The inhabitants are really frightened, arid I am beset with appeals for protection.   These brigand bands are, I fear, all c  . part of a plot to form an encircling net;(6.) The withdrawal of the Greeks from Ismid uncovers my front.The withdrawal from Brusa, if carried out, as seems probable, will uncover my flank.(c.) The Bolshevik concentration in Bessarabia of 80,000 may be serious, and provide an opportunity for Mustapha. , &apos;.   - ;(d.) The increasing truculence of Mustapha; and his failure to carry out promises &apos; of Bekir Sami.5. It is quite evident that Mustapha knows-(a.) That.the Greeks are failing. (6.) Our difficulties in England, Ireland, Egypt, &amp;c. ,:   (c.) The Bolshevik plans against Roumania.(di) The French concern over Cilicia.        ;       \ ;  .That we are not even under one command, but three commands. .  ,Why should he then stop to be civil ?   He will not.&apos; .He only aims at being the &quot; Saviour of Turkey,&quot; and a high position after it. 6. That being so he may, as pointed out in the&apos;GeneralStaff paper, either (a.) Go for Smyrna. ;(-[   -:--   ^    *. j  (b.) Go for Constantinople.&apos;          ,              &apos;     -       ;, ,;;   (c.) Go direct for the Dardanelles to cut us off. ......Personally, I should choose (b) as by so doing all the Turks, Gendarmerie, soldiers, and&apos; civilians would become Kemalists and acclaim him. He would then have little difficulty over regaining Smyrna. -7. In either case my position becomes serious. .1 have only two white battalions and four native battalions, all under strength, the 20th Hussars under, sentence of disbandment, and one Brigade of Artillery, with which to keep open the Bosphorus and protect.Constantinople and the Dardanelles. - . \ . . &apos;   i...   . vIf seriously threatened it becomes an impossible task. -   - -       -One cannot protect the Bosphorus or the fleet anchorage unless one holds both sides.   Our ships could not remain if the enemy had the Asiatic shore, and it would he thoroughly unsound to expose a small force on the Asiatic, side without power of suppor.fr and with the French forbidden to send a soldier into Asia.-&apos; &apos; 8: To withdraw the British force to the European.side would be useless. It would have no objective. It would become rotten with venereal in the town. If encamped dutside, it would be liable to be shelled from the Asiatic side. Its line of communication would be threatened and, moreover, native troops are unsuitable for dealing with riots.9. From a military point of view I am, therefore, bound to recommend that the force be withdrawn from Constantinople and its present area unless you are prepared to reinforce it up to 2\ Divisions, which I know, is quite impossible in present circumstances.10. From a political point of view I should be very sorry to see a withdrawal and I know Sir Horace Rumbold holds this view strongly.The British name in Constantinople,. thanks to Sir Horace Rumbold and his predecessor, Admiral De Robeck, stands very high.The British Navy and Army are greatly respected. We stand for fairness and justice..Withdrawal wOuld mean  . &apos;(a.) Loss of prestige.(b.) Loss of valuable information.; ,(c.) Reaction in other theatres and corresponding jubilation.(d.) Loss of our duties of occupation. - , J(e.) Blow to trade, industry, and education, &apos; .: v11. As a military problem, which is the aspect with which I am,alone concerned, I have no hesitation in saying that.the retention of our small force without hope of reinforcements is unsound and dangerous, and exposing it to an undue risk.
12. Realizing the fear of the inhabitants, I made a proposal to the Allied High Commissioners to form a battalion of Turkish Gendarmerie in the British area in Asia to keep law and order, and without prejudice to the future. This was approved, but the French and Italian Governments have now refused to support their High Commissioners. This means, I fear, that the 3,000 . a month required from Turkish funds will not be forthcoming.13. The Prime Minister asked me this evening to consider what force would be required to hold the Dardanelles. If one presupposes Constantinople and the whole of Asia Minor in the hands of a victorious Kemalist army, then it would be an impossible task to contemplate resisting the whole weight of Turkey with any force which could possibly be within our power to produce. It would be merely a matter of time until we should be forced off the mainland.If, however, the holding of the position covering Chanak is contemplated solely as a rearguard position, then, in my opinion, 2 British Battalions, 1 Cavalry Regiment and a proportion of Artillery would suffice,, supported, if weather conditions permit, by the guns of the Fleet; but it is only right to point out that if the rest of Asia Minor was in the hands of the Turks, a small force of this kind, with its back to the sea, would be in a very difficult position, and would be subsequently forced to withdraw in unfavourable circumstances if seriously attacked. It is probable that the Turks would take early steps to dislodge it.14. I am glad to report satisfactorily on the state of efficiency and training of the troops.I am also glad to report that our relations with all the Allies are good, and that I have received nothing but kindness on every side.15. I should also like to place on record the cordial help which I have received from the Royal Navy, especially from Admirals De Robeck, Webb and Tyrwhitt, and I can honestly say that the support extended to me by Sir Horace Rumbold has made the work during the past somewhat anxious months nothing but a pleasure.C. H. Harington,Lieutenant-General.25th May, 1921.
