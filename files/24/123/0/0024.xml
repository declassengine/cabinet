(vi). that &apos;each&apos; of the High Contracting parties hereby declares that it has not entered into any treaty, agreement or understanding with a third party directed against the interests of the other High Contracting Party, and agrees that it will not during the continuance of this treaty enter into such treaty, agreement, or understanding;

(vii). that &apos;the Government of Gt. Britain, in order to mark its sense of the friendly spirit shown by His Majesty the late Amir during the recent war against the German Empire and its Allies, and in consideration of the fulfilment in their entirety by the Government of Afghanistan of the engagements stimulated by the foreign articles, agrees to pay to the Government of Afghanistan&apos; an annual subsidy of 20Â½ lakhs of rupees with effect from the date of ratification of the treaty; also, as &apos;an immediate and additional taken of goodwill&apos;, a lump sum of 31 lakhs on ratifications.

It has been recognised throughout on the British side that the course of the British-Afghan negotiations must depend largely upon the line taken in the Afghan-Russian negotiations that have bean proceeding, simultaneously, the general governing principle being that we must be satisfied before concluding, a treaty with the Afghans that there is nothing in the Afghan-Bolshevik arrangements directed against our interests. The particular features in the Russian proposals to which objection was been taken are

(i) the establishment of Russian Consulates in the eastern portion of Afghanistan; and (ii) the grant of money and arms to the Afghans by the Bolsheviks.

It has been agreed that the disclosure by the Afghans of the Bolshevik treaty should be insisted on as a test good faith and Sir H.Dobbs has asked for this, and on the 17th April asked further for the disclosure of all agreements, secret
secret or otherwise, concluded or contemplated between Afghanistan and other powers ? (See below as to Afghan-Turkish Treaty). The Afghans have not hitherto disclosed the Afghan-Russian Treaty, and it is uncertain whether the text as finally revised at Moscow has yet reached Kabul.

Meanwhile M Krassin has communicated what professes to be the text of the treaty. This provides, inter alia, for

(1) the establishment of Russian Consulates at Kandahar and Ghazni (within the area covered by the British objection); and (ii) the grant by the Soviet Government to Afghanistan of an annual subsidy of 1,000,000 roubles. Nothing is said specifically in this text of a gift of arms, but there is reason to suppose that there are additional secret clauses on this subject.

It has been agreed throughout that the objection to Russian Consulates in Eastern Afghanistan must be maintained, and it is understood that the Government of India adhere to this view. As regards a Bolshevik subsidy and gift of arms to the Afghans, there has been some difference of view. His Majesty&apos;s  Government have throughout hold that the objections to these are so strong as to make them probably, if not certainly, incompatible with a British treaty of friendship; but the Government of India have demurred to this view, and it has been conceded in reply that &apos;money and arms, objectionable as they are in themselves, must be looked at in relation to whole situation&apos;; and ? that the possibility of modifying the objections of His Majesty&apos;s Government to money and arms if/
if the general situation is sufficiently satisfactory, need not be completely exc1uded.

The Government of India now urge that it is impossible to insist on the stoppage of Soviet money and arms as a condition of any British-Afghan treaty of friendship. The alternatives in their view are as follows (Viceroy&apos;s telegram of 27th April).

(a) to offer Afghanistan sufficient inducement in money and arms, and assurances of assistance against Russia if necessary, to make her throw over the Bolshevik treaty entirely;

(b) to make the Amir a final offer of our draft treaty as it stands, plus a public and formal assurance against aggression by a third Power, coupled with a demand for the disclosure of all treaties formed or contemplated;

(c) to continue to try to modify our draft treaty in unessentials so as to make it acceptable to the Amir, insisting on the conclusion of the Eastern Consulates and on the disclosure of the Bolshevik Treaty, and giving the Amir supplementary assurances in the form of a letter regarding support in the event of Russian aggression.

The Government of India consider that course (b) must be rejected as likely to lead to an immediate rupture of negotiations, with seriously embarrassing effects on the frontier situation and on the internal situation in India.

They agree with the suggestion made from this end that course (a), if we could secure an arrangement which would &apos;make a clean sweep of the Bolshevik treaty and of Bolshevik influence from Afghanistan&apos;, would be preferable and worth a/
considerable increase of the British offers to Afghanistan-   But the consider that in any case 1 it would be better to have a treaty which dees net rlease us than to have none at all1.It is not unlikely that Lord Feeding is under no Illusion as to the value cf such a treaty in itself, and that he is influenced mainly by what he anticipates will be the effect on the tribal and to some extent the internal situation of coming away without one*The Government of India therefore ask for authority to adopt course (e) (including authority to Sir K. Dobbs to increase the annual subsidy to  5 or even 30 lakhs Ho cover any whittling down of Russian concessions in consequence of our treaty&apos;), Sir H. Dobbs being at the same time Instructed to bear in mind that a treaty that would exclude the Bolshevists altogether from Afghanistan would be preferable, and to seek an opportunity of securing this.Reference was made above to the Afghan-Turkish treaty.   It is known that a treaty between the Afghans and the Angora Government was signed at Moscow about the beeinning of March* There is some doubt at present as to Its precise terms, but it apparently includes a defensive alliance and provides for Turkish assistance in organising and training the Afghan army, and according to reports from Constantinople a Military Mission of considerable dimensions is actually on its way from Angora to Afghanistan^   The Government of India have been asked for their views as to the bearing of this on the Afphrn negotiations, and whether in their opinion the same attitude should not be adopted towards the Turkish as towards the Russian Treaty* They have not directly replied to these enquiries; but their proposed course (c) (unlike course (b)) does not apparently contemplate any stipulation In regard to the Afghan-turkish treaty/
Treaty. It is necessary to decide vdiat attitude should be adopted towards this treaty also.I recommend that the Cabinet should agree with lord Readings(Intd.) E. S. M.India Oflice. May 9thf 1921.
