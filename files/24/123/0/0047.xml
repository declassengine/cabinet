PART I-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.There is no change to report regarding the dispute in the coal mining industry, all the districts having now expressed their approval of the rejection of the Government&apos;s offer by the national delegate conference on the 28th April. The unemployment position grows steadily worse in consequence of the dispute, but proposals for a settlement are still being put forward. In a letter which appeared in the Times on the 4th May, Mr. F. Hodges suggested that any financial assistance which the Government might give should be definitely related to the cost of living; and, on the 9th, a memorandum was issued by Lord Weir, in which he suggested that the proposals and counter-proposals hitherto put forward by the parties concerned should now be abandoned &quot; as incapable of providing a basis of settlement,&quot; and that the Government should submit to the miners and owners proposals based on an analysis of the economic and industrial facts of the case, which would involve, inter alia, a return by the miners to the 8-hour working day. Meanwhile, the question of sympathetic action is again becoming prominent, and there is once more a danger of a serious extension of the dispute. The immediate causes of the trouble are the movement of coal from one part of the country to another, and the proposal of the Government to import coal from, abroad. The transport workers and railwaymen in certain areas have signified their refusal to handle such coal. Strikes have occurred in various districts, the most serious being at Glasgow and on the Clyde, Avhere work at the docks has been practically at a standstill since the 6th. May. Railway-men on the Caledonian Railway have also been suspended from duty because of their refusal to handle coal unloaded by voluntary labour. Joint action by the railway-men and transport workers is threatened, and the executive council of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation resolved, on the 10th May, to &quot; tighten the embargo on coal likely to defeat the Miners&apos; federation.&quot; This decision appears to mark an advance on the federation^ previous instructions, which wereconcer ned mainly with foreign coal. Another factor contributing to an extension of the dispute is the vigorous unofficial propaganda which is being carried on in favour of a strike of railwaymen and transport workers on the 15th May. In a number of localities the movement for drastic action appears to originate with the rank and file, who are bringing pressure to bear upon their officials.Particulars are given below of the dispute in the mercantile marine, and of the progress of negotiations in the building, cotton and engineering industries. In connection with the last an important conference between the unions and the employers&apos; organisations con-cerned will be held at York on the 12th May.The fifty-third Annual Co-operative Congress will be opened at Scarborough on the 16th May, at which, inter alia, the proposed Labour and Co-operative Political Alliance will be again discussed.The Unemployment Position.Statistics.-^On the 29th April, in the United Kingdom, 1,799,445 unemployment books binder the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and out-of-work donation policies, remained lodged for workers totally unemployed, of which 1,305,959 were lodged by males and 493,486 by females. At the same date 1,077,318 unemployment books and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers on short time, of which 524,008 were lodged by males and 553,310 by females.These figures show an increase on the previous week of 88,310 totally unemployed and 67,475 working short time.The total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 6th May was 1,920,522. The above are advance figures provided by the Employ-ment department and are subject to revision.A full analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 4221
FEATURES OF THE WEEK.General Topics.Sympathetic Action by Trade Unions in Support of the Miners. The most important development in the situation during the past week has been the efforts of certain sections of the transport workers, and the railwaymen to organise an unofficial general strike. On the 4th May, an unofficial conference of members of the National Union of Railwaymen was held at Cardiff to consider means of assisting the miners. The official report of the meeting states that serious consideration was given to the present crisis, the delegates expressing their condemnation of &quot; the betrayal of the miners by the Triple Alliance.&quot; It was definitely decided to organise &quot; a movement for the purpose of securing for, the rank and file some means of bringing greater pressure to bear upon the heads of the society to carry out the mandates of the governing body,&quot; and a sub-committee was appointed to draft a constitution. A resolution was passed by the conference expressing approval of the action of the miners, and demanding that a special general meeting should be called by the executive committee of the union, with a view to giving the miners full support by the immediate withdrawal of labour. This &quot; unofficial movement &quot; among railwaymen is developing on lines similar to the &quot; unofficial movement&quot; which developed among the miners as a result of the coal strike of last year.A mass meeting of trade unionists, stated to be the outcome of a movement by the transport workers, was held at Canning Town on the 8th May, at which an unofficial national strike was advocated, and a resolution was passed calling upon the men to take the necessary steps for a national stoppage on the 15th May.The National Transport Workers&apos; Federation and the National Union of Railwaymen have issued a further statement, urging all workers engaged in loading, discharging and manning ships conveying coal from abroad to Great Britain to refuse in any way to work this foreign coal. If any action by the authorities in using the military or naval forces should break through the embargo of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, the members of the National Union of Railwaymen are urged to refuse to,move the.foreign coal.A strike of dock labourers at Glasgow Harbour began on the 6th May, in consequence of non-union labour being used for the unloading of steamers which have been held up in the harbour for some days. Dockers employed on the Clyde also came out on strike on the 6th May, as a result of non-union labour being employed by the shipowners to unload coal, and it is stated that the stoppage is now complete and no work is being done by union labour.Proposals for the reform and reconstruction of the Triple Alliance are to be put forward at the annual meeting of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation by the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union.Co-operative societies and trade unions are still, giving financial assistance to the miners, but it is evident that the funds of many of the county miners&apos; associations are seriously depleted.National Federation of Building Trades Operatives-It is reported that a further step in the opposition of the building trades operatives to the Governments proposal to introduce 50,000 ex-Service men into the industry lias been taken, by the issue of a special circular to all branches of the federation throughout the country, This document calls the attention of members to the details of the Goyernmenfs scheme, and goes on to formulate the duty of members when the scheme is put into operation, in the following terms: &quot; 1. If dilutees are introduced in your workshop or job, under no circumstances must you assist in training.&quot; 2. Dilutees must not be allowed to enter the instructional factories set up for the training of ex-Service men.&quot; 3. If dilutees are started in your workshop, or on your job, the full facts- must be tabulated at once and reported to your society and the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives.&quot; In regard to No. 1, if you are victimised by employers for refusing to train, your unions and the national federation will support you.&quot; In regard to No. 2, if dilutees are introduced, the teachers for training disabled men will be at once withdrawn or expelled from their unions.&quot; Any violation of these instructions by any member or members must be at once reported to their unions, and members must be dealt with under their general rules.&quot;(B 17329T) 3 G2
Features of the Week-cowJwiwed.The circular is signed by Mr. George Hicks, president, and Mr. R. Coppock, secretary of the federation.Suspension of the Guaranteed Week on Tramways and Railways. The position in Sheffield, to which reference was made in last week&apos;s issue of this Report, appears to have changed for the worse during the past week, and the general manager of the tramways has stated that, in view of the drastic reductions in the tramway service which it will be necessary tovmake, all the employees are to receive one week&apos;s notice, so that on and after the 11th May their services can only be made use of from day to day, as circumstances permit.It is also announced that the London and North-Western Railway Company are further reducing employment in the railway shops at Crewe to four clays a week.Engineering and Shipbuilding: The ii-Hour Week In December, 1919, it was determined to set up a joint committee of employers and employed in the engineering and shipbuilding industries, to investigate the economic relation of production to hours of work, and the methods of manufacture, in the two industries in this and other countries, and it was agreed that, pending the completion of the inquiry, the claim which was then being put forward by the trade unions for a reduction in working hours from 4.7 to 44 per week should be adjourned. An account was given in this Report of the progress of the inquiry from its commencement to the 15th November last.* It is now reported that the members of the joint committee will shortly be proceeding to Holland to pursue inquiries into conditions there.Industrial and Other Organisations.Guild of Insurance Officials. The annual conference of the Guild ot Insurance Officials opened at Scarborough on the 8th May. A resolution was passed to the effect that the guild should endeavour to obtain the establishment of a &quot; Whitley Council&quot; in the insurance profession. The long-standing dispute between the General Accident, Fire and Life Assurance Corporation and their staff was discussed, and it was resolved to take further steps to secure the consent of the Minister of Labour to the setting up of a Court of Inquiry under the Industrial Courts Act, 1919.At the second and closing session of the conference on the 9th May, it,was decided to admit as members staffs engaged in certain sections of National Health Insurance. A new scale of salaries is to be drafted for all insurance workers, and a committee appointed to consider the question of affiliation with other trade unions, and to decide what shall be the policy of the Guild with regard to political action.NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Engineers (National)-It is reported that the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations have invited the Amalgamated Engineering Union, the National Union of Foundry Workers and the National Federation of General Workers to meet them jointly in conference at York on the 12th May, to consider the proposed reductions in wages. Hitherto the employers&apos; federations have met the unions in question separately. It is understood that representatives of the unions met on the 11th May and agreed upon a policy of strong resistance to the employers&apos; demand for a reduction in wages.The Amalgamated Engineering Union have issued a reply to the statement of the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations on &quot; the present economic position of the engineering and allied industries.&quot;! A summary of the reply will appear in the Labour Gazette for May, 1921.Cotton Textile Workers (Lancashire). With reference to the statement in last week&apos;s issue of this Report regarding the expiry on the 6th May of the wage agreements in the cotton textile industry, it is reported that the executive committee of the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations, Ltd., decided at a meeting on the 6th May, to give notice of a reduction of 95 per cent, on the standard list of wages, which is equal to 30 per cent, on the present actual rates.  It is also stated that notice of this reduction has been* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 25, 18th December, pp. 677-8.t See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 14, 2nd April, p. 313, and the Labour Gazette, April, 1921, pp. 179-180.
sent to the spinners and to the cardroom workers&apos; amalgamation. About 200,000 opera-fives are affected by this proposal.Satvmillers (Sheffield). The Amalgamated Society of Wood Cutting Machinists at Sheffield have received three months&apos; notice from the Sheffield and District Saw Mill Proprietors&apos; Association of a reduction in wages to take place from the end of June.A joint meeting may possibly be held to discuss these proposals. The employers have agreed to arrange for the working of systematic short time, and not to dismiss workmen unless the necessity arises.0Strikes and Lock-Outs.Coal Miners (National). There is as yet no indication of an early settlement of this dispute.During the past week the main interest has been centred in the coalfields, where, in many places, district meetings have been held, the result being, without exception, that resolutions have been passed endorsing the decision of the national delegate con-ference to reject the Governments offer. Such resolutions have been passed in the following districts : Derbyshire, Warwickshire, Forest of Dean, Rhondda, Cheshire, Leicestershire, North Staffordshire, Nottinghamshire, Merthyr, Lancashire, Yorkshire and Northumberland. In the case of Northumberland the resolution rejecting the Governments offer was referred to the constituent branches to be voted upon ; and it is. reported that already 90 per cent, of the branches have endorsed the action taken by the Council.The question of taking a ballot of the men has been under discussion during the week, and Mr. Herbert Smith has stated publicly that he would be favourable towards this course if the men desired it, but that, up to the present, no offer had been made that was good enough to warrant a ballot being taken.Mr. Robert Smillie addressed a mass meeting of miners at Jjarkhall on the 2nd May, when lie appealed to them to stand firm.Proposals for settling the dispute have been made during the week by Lord Weir in a memorandum which lie addressed to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the secretary of the Mining Association, and the secretary of the Miners&apos; Federation. The main objects of these proposals are a reduction in coal prices; increased output; economic independence of the industry, obviating the need for a subsidy; ancl a good standard of wages for the miners. It is contended that these objects can be attained by an 8-hour working day ; a reduction in wages equal to 2s. per shift, and in the case of piece-workers the substitution of extra percentages for flat rate advances, such as the war and Sankey wages ; elimination of unproductive costs ; and saving of costs of stores, timber and general charges.Electricians (National). A conference was held between the National Federated Electrical Association and the Electrical Trades Union on the 19th April, to consider the employers&apos; proposal for an immediate reduction in rates of wages of 20 per cent. This proposal was amended to one for a reduction of 12^ per cent., to which the union made a counter-offer of 5 per cent. Subsequently, a settlement was provisionally arranged, and has been put to both sides as an agreed? recommendation. The terms of the settlement are as follows,:-&quot; A reduction of 5 per cent, on present rates to operate on the pay-day in the week commencing the 9th May. A further reduction of 5 per cent, taken on the present rates, i.e., 10 per cent, in all, to operate on the pay-day from week commencing the 9th July.&quot;A ballot vote of the union&apos;s members is being taken and the announcement of the result is expected shortly.On the 24tli April the executive of the Electrical Trades Union passed the following resolution: &quot; In the event of the National Federated Electrical Association forcing a reduction pending the result of our vote, members are instructed to cease work immediately.&quot;It is reported that as a result of this resolution many members of the union are on strike in London and in the provinces. The dispute is at present confined to the employees of contractors, but there is danger of its spreading to&apos; workers employed in generating stations if any attempt is made to reduce wages immediately.Shipbuilders (National). With regard to the ballot of the men in connection with the agreement reached at the conference at Carlisle on the 19th April,* between the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation and the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding
Trades, it is stated that the craft unions voted against the reduction. Some of the unions, including the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers, did not vote, while others, including the Electrical Trades Union, made no return to the Federation of Engineering and Ship-building Trades. The majority for acceptance was due to the voting of the semi-skilled and unskilled unions, but, as it had been agreed that the result was to be decided by the aggregate vote, the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation were informed by the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades that their proposals had been accepted.These facts appear to have caused resentment among some of the skilled workers concerned, and 1,500 workers in shipbuilding yards at Leith ceased work on the 3rd May, having refused to accept the reductions in wages. A number of Clyde shipyard electricians are also reported to have ceased work.Seamen (National). lb will be remembered that at a meeting of the National Maritime Board held at the Hotel Cecil on the 22nd April,51&apos; reductions in the wages of certain classes of seamen were agreed upon, but the representatives of the National Union of Ship Stewards, Cooks, Bakers and Butchers refused to agree to the proposed reductions.At a meeting of the National Maritime Board held in London on the 5th May the decision of this union was reported to the Board. The shipowners&apos; representatives there-upon indicated that, as far as the catering department was concerned, they considered themselves freed from the- existing scales and conditions, and would only be prepared to employ members of that department at the reduced rates.. The representatives of the cooks and stewards&apos; union who were present announced that they were not prepared to accept any reduction in the existing standard rates of wages. This decision was subse-quently reported by the president of the union to the executive -of the National Federation of Transport Workers, and it is reported that a resolution was adopted pledging the Federation to support the union in any conflict which might arise. The dispute has already affected some passenger boats;On the 9th May the union issued a manifesto, in which they stated that &quot; all members are instructed to cease work on and after the 10th May, except men on articles at the old rates of pay. No articles must be signed after this date under any circumstances without orders from your local committee.&quot;Fishermen (Various Districts). In the fishing industry disputes arising out of the proposed reductions in pay are still in progress at Scarborough and HartlepooLf On the Tyne, at a joint conference on the 2nd May, the owners agreed to produce figures showing the state of the industry, but owing to the policy since adopted by the officials of the National Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Union, the owners have now refused any further meeting with them. The representative of the Tyne Steam Packet Provident Society is stated to be siding with the employers.!- Trawlermen (Granton). As a protest against a proposed reduction in wages of 12^ per cent. 600 trawlermen employed by the Granton trawler owners cease^l work on the 6th May.Settlements and Agreements.Builders (National). The National Wages and Conditions Council for the BuildingTrades, which adjourned on the 22nd April$ met again in London on the 5th and 6th May.Consideration of the employers&apos; application for an extension of the 44-hour working week was adjourned.  At the close of the conference the following joint statement was issued : . &quot; The National Wages and Conditions Council has considered the reference to it of the notices pending for alterations of wages and conditions, and although, owing to the complexity of the matters submitted, the council has not yet completed its labours, it has arrived at the following decisions and has adjourned until May 31st, when it expects to be in a position to complete the business. The council had before them the fact that upon the present-day cost of living there is warrant for a reduction under the sliding scale of 3r2. per hour, but as an interim award the reduction indicated in the following resolution has been given: &apos; The council agreed that the wages of craftsmen and labourers be reduced 2d. per hour as and from May 16th, and that the wages of labourers be reduced a further Id. per hour as from July 1st, and that this meeting stands adjourned until May 31st, when the difference between the rates of craftsmen&apos;s and labourers&apos; wages will be further considered and decided.&apos; In the interim, a joint committee of employers and labourers, with a representative of the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives, shall meet to inquire into the operation of any reduction of labourers&apos; wages and the effect such reduction would nave on the lower-paid districts in order that the minimum shall not fall below an agreed amount. It was further agreed that both parties in the meantime shall endeavour to arrive at a, recommendation as regards hours of work which will be considered at the July meeting of the council.&quot;* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 18, 30th April, p. 382. f See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 18, 30th April, p. 382. j See also p. 418 below.I See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 18, 30th April, p. 380.
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.*Saivmillers (Scotland).-Negotiations following the conference at Glasgow on the 15th April* between the Scottish Timber Merchants and Sawmillers&apos; Association and the Amalgamated Society of Wood Cutting Machinists lias resulted in the following agree-ment: &quot; (1) A reduction of Id. per hour, to take effect on the pay due first pay-day in May. (2) A reduction of a further Id. per hour, to take effect on the pay due first pay-day in June. (3) No further alteration in wages to take place until the first pay-day in July, when a reduction, at the rate of fcif. per hour for every fall of 5 points (or nearest fraction to 5 points) from 135 in the Board of Trade monthly index figure, will be made. Subsequent corresponding alterations, if any, will take place automatically&apos; on the first pay-day of the month following the publication of the index figure. In the event of the said index figure increasing, the rate of wages to be increased in the same ratio per hour. (4) One-half of the above reductions or corresponding advances to apply to apprentices. (5) This agreement to remain in force for at least six months from this date and to be terminable on the expiry of the period, or on a later date, by either party, on giving one month&apos;s previous notice in writing to the other.&quot;Furnishing Trade (High Wycombe). An agreement has been reached between the High Wycombe Furnishing Trades Association and the National Amalgamated Furnishing Trades&apos; Association, involving reductions in wages of 2s. per week in the case of apprentices and learners ; Id. and \\d. per hour, as the case may be, for women workers; and 2d. per hour for journeymen. The agreement also provides that future adjustments shall be made on a cost-of-living sliding scale.Waterproof Workers (Manchester). An agreement lias been arrived- at between the Waterproof Garment Making Section of the Indiarubber Manufacturers&apos; Association and the Waterproof Garment Workers&apos; Trade Union, providing for an immediate reduction in wages of 10 per cent., and a further reduction of llr per cent, on the 7th July, 1921.JCinema Employees (Scotland). The difficulty created by the passing of a resolution by the Scottish Trades Union Congress on the -question of &quot; unionising every place of amusement in the United Kingdom &quot;f has been overcome ; and the Scottish Cinema Owners&apos; Association have now signed the agreement with the Electrical Trades Union. The situation was reviewed at a meeting of the Parliamentary Committee of the Congress held on the 6th May, and it is understood that the attitude of the Electrical Trades Union was vindicated.[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Industrial Relations Departments section of the Report, pages 418 to 421.]* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 17, 23rd March, p. 364. t See this Rep ort, Vol. Ill, No. 19, 7th May, p. 398. 1 See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 17, 23rd April, p. 364.

PART IL-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DEPARTMENT.BUILDING AND WORKS OF CONSTRUCTION.Heating and Domestic Engineers. On the 3rd May, Sir David Shackleton received a deputation from the Joint Industrial Council, who asked whether the Minister would appoint a Court of Inquiry under the Industrial Courts Act. He pointed out that the Minister was bound to avoid using this machinery as a method of compulsory arbitration. He asked the deputation to let him have information with regard to the outstanding demar-cation disputes, and proposed then to have another interview with the plumbers.Masons (Yelverton). Between 60 and 70 granite masons employed by the South Devon Granite Co. struck early in April, protesting against the firm&apos;s notice of a change in working hours by which they would start work at 7.30 a.m. instead of 7 and finish at 5 instead of 4.30 p.m., still maintaining the 47-hour week, The labourers, members of the National Union of General Workers, engaged in this quarry, work 50 hours per week from 7 a.m. till 5 p.m. Owing to the departments intervention, a meeting between the parties took place, and it was agreed that work should be resumed on the 2nd May, with hours from 7.30 to 4.30 p.m. pending arbitration.Asphalt Workers (Scotland). At a joint meeting, on the 26th April, consequent upon the intervention of the Chief Conciliation Officer, a new agreement was arrived at which allows a wages reduction of Id. per hour, to continue until the wages in the building trades in Scotland are altered by agreement, when a further conference is to be arranged.MINING AND QUARRYING.Quarrying (Freestone Section). It is reported that subsequent to the failure of the Joint Industrial Council to reach an agreement, the operative stonemasons in certain towns have consented to reductions, whereas the Workers&apos; Union, who predominate in the Hipperholme, Lightcliffe, Brighouse, Rastrick and Southowram districts, have come out on strike.Artificial Stone. The Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee met in order to consider the employers&apos; proposal for a reduction of wages by \\d. per hour. The chairman asked the workers&apos; side to consider also the adoption of a sliding scale, wages to be reduced \d. for every 7 points drop in the cost of living, and the basic rate to be S^d. per hour as against the pre-war rate of 5d. per hour. The workers&apos;^side asked for a short postponement until the results of the arbitration in the clay industries and of the negotiations in the building industry were known.   It was accordingly decided to meet again on the 20th May.Clay. The Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee, who had been unable to reach any agreement on the 22nd April with regard to the employers&apos; amended proposal for a reduction in wages by 8s. per week, met again on the 28th April. The workers&apos; side still declined to accept any reduction unless the matter were referred to the Industrial Court for arbitration, and the employers&apos; side finally agreed to this suggestion.FOOD AND DRINK.&apos; &quot;Fishing Industry (Milford Haven). At the adjourned meeting of the Conciliation Board on the 2nd May, general discussion ensued as to the future of the Board. A decision on the present wages question however, was not pressed, the owners having agreed to meet a representative of the National Sailors and Firemen&apos;s Union the next day. At this meeting, the owners offered to enter into an agreement with the union on the lines of that made with, the Milford Haven Amalgamated Steam Trawler Engineers&apos; Union, provided that they would recognise a new union, the Milford Haven Skippers and Fishermen&apos;s Union, which many of the men who have broken away from the national union have joined. An agreement has also been arrived at between the owners and. the National Amalgamated Labourers&apos; Union, to which shore labourers belong.
(b 17329T)CHEMICALS AND EXPLOSIVES.Chemicals. The proposals for reduction of wages* came before the Executive Com-mittee of the Industrial Council on the 22nd April, after being reported to members of the unions. It was stated for the workers&apos; side that the secretary of the Council had been informed that the unions could not agree to the proposals, and that the matter therefore could not be arranged by resolution. The employers were asked to refrain from making the supplementary alterations in June and July, and replied that, while the request would be noted, no hope could be held out that there would be any change in their intention. The wages reduction has, therefore, been brought into operation, the unions presumably not considering that they were in a sufficiently strong position to call a strike on this issue.TEXTILES.Silk A meeting was held at Macclesfield on the 2nd May, between representatives of employers and workers, with the assistance of mediators appointed by the Industrial Council, to consider the question of a reduction in wages. It is understood that the employers proposed to reduce the wages of piece-workers by amounts varying from 20 per cent, to 40 per cent., and those of day workers by 6s. a week. As it was impossible to effect an agreement, the Ministry have been asked to appoint an umpire to hear the difference, assisted.by two trade assessors appointed by the Council.PRINTING AND PAPER.&apos;Paper Making. The first meeting of the Paper Making Industrial Council was held on the 4th May. Mr. C. R. Seddon was elected chairman, and Mr. J. Pearson, of the Amal-gamated Society of Papermakers, vice-chairman. Mr. A. W. Foster, 26, Farringdon Street, E.C., and Mr. A. E. Holness, General Buildings, Aldwych, W.C., were elected joint secretaries.The meeting discussed the Safeguarding of Industries Bill, and the state of the trade, which is said to be very bad. Three representatives from the workers&apos; side were added to a Propaganda Committee which the employers had previously appointed, with a view to pressing the claims of the industry upon Parliament and the public generally. Workers were also appointed to the committee of the employers&apos; technical section, which will shortly set up an elaborate system of technical education, coupled with examinations.PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND PUBLIC UTILITY SERVICES.Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services, Manual Workers (England and Wales).  The National Council met on the 6th May. An appeal by the Eastbourne Corporation against the decision of the Southern Home Counties Provincial Council on the question of grading was dealt with, and a decision given. The agenda was prepared for a conference of representatives of the Provincial Councils and the National Council, to be held shortly to consider the reconstitution of the National Council and other matters. A request made by the trade union side of the West Midland Provincial Council that the Council should lay down a general policy for a uniform method of reducing wages was referred to the Provincial Councils for observations.Tramway Workers (Hastings).-A strike of 200 tramwaymen employed by the Hastings Tramway Company took place on the 24th April, owing to the alleged wrongful dismissal of an inspector. The Chief Conciliation Officer immediately got into touch with the parties, and negotiations were subsequently entered into, with the result that work was resumed on the 29th April.GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.Industrial and Trade Joint Councils. At a meeting of the Co-ordination Committee of the Trade Joint Councils at the Treasury on the 31st March, the official side submitted suggestions for the reconstitution of the Departmental Industrial Councils, empowering them, in addition to their previous functions, to deal with wages questions affecting only-employees of the department concerned, and for the formation of a Central Council to deal with all general questions affecting employees of more than one department, the Trade Joint Councils to cease to exist accordingly.  Sir Malcolm Ramsay explained that
the proposals were made with a view to the simplification of the machinery and were put forward purely for consideration. The trade union side intimated that the matter was one for the consideration of the trade unions concerned as a whole.A conference of the trade union representatives was held at Montagu House on the 13th April, and resolved that the Trade Joint Councils and Departmental Councils should continue to function under present conditions. It was announced as the feeling of the conference that, before any alteration in the present constitution is suggested, greater experience of the working of the Trade Joint Councils should be gained, and that, with this end in view, the working of the existing machinery should be expedited in order that the various Councils can proceed to deal with the urgent business before them. The Treasury have intimated to the departments that any further action towards the revision of the Whitley machinery for industrial establishments should await a more favourable opportunity.Admiralty. The Industrial Council met on the 6th May, to dispose of arrears of business. In addition to questions relating to the status of classes peculiar to the Admiralty, certain questions of general interest were considered.In reply to a motion from the trade union side that the principle of walking time should be conceded in the case of men whose place of work was situated beyond a certain defined distance from the muster stations, the chairman said that he was in sympathy with the object of the motion, but the practical difficulties were such that he was unable to accept it. After Considerable pressure from the trade union side, it was agreed that the trade union representatives should formulate detailed proposals for the consideration of the Admiralty. It was agreed to appoint representatives to consult with the Admiralty Administrative Council in regard to certain classes of workers whose classification as between an administrative and an industrial category was in doubt.A proposal from the trade union side that the record kept against a man for offences committed should be expunged after two years&apos; satisfactory service was rejected by the Admiralty.The chairman announced that, although the general prohibition against smoking in the Dockyards must be continued, it had been decided to empower local officers to grant smoking facilities at certain times, in places that were considered safe.MISCELLANEOUS TRADES.Tailors and Tailor esses (London). The strike continues. At the suggestion of the department, a further meeting of the Conciliation Board was held on the 6th May, but the parties were unable to arrive at a settlement. The employers are still unwilling to refer the matter to arbitration, although the rules of the Conciliation Board provide for the reference of disputes to a conciliator &quot; whose decision shall be final,&quot; and the constitution of their association also provides for the reference of differences to arbitration.Shirt Makers (Manchester). A strike of 40 shirt makers employed by Messrs. Sutcliffe, Manchester, took place on the 28th April in consequence of an attempt to reduce wages. The firm are non-federated, but it is stated that they have always followed the wages fixed by the Employers&apos; Federation, which correspond with those fixed by the Trade Board. The firm, however, pay piece-rates. They suggested first a 20 per cent, reduction and afterwards a 10 per cent, reduction, which, the union believe, would bring the rates below the Trade Board minima.Conferences were arranged by the Chief Conciliation Officer on the 3rd and the 5th May. The firm produced figures of weekly individual earnings to prove that the Trade Board rates would be maintained. The union are reporting to their general executive, and it is thought probable that work will be resumed at an early date.Shop Assistants (Manchester). Negotiations have been in progress for some time past between Manchester, Salford and District Association and the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks on a reduction in the rates fixed by an agreement between the parties last September. The agreement was due to expire in March, but the employers decided to make no reduction until the first pay-day in May, when their proposed reductions based on a sliding scale should come into operation. A ballot of the union members rejected the employers&apos; offer by an overwhelming majority. The Chief Conciliation Officer has arranged a conference for the 9th May, and the employers have therefore agreed to postpone the reductions for a week.
GENERAL DEPARTMENT.TRADE BOARDS. PROCEEDINGS.Aerated Waters Trade Board (England and Wales). The Board appointed a committee to consider the question of making representations in regard to the regulations proposed to be made under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, with respect to the manufacturing of aerated water.It was unanimously agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer be asked to receive a deputation on the special burden of taxation borne by the trade.Button Making Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board agreed to suggest to the Minister the desirability of keeping in mind the position of the out-workers in Birmingham when fresh legislation on unemployment insurance is being introduced.After consideration of summaries of opinions expressed by, and a reference from, the Ministry with regard to the scope of the button making trade, it was resolved to ask the Minister to conduct a routine inspection of button manufacturing firms in the East End, and further to inform the Ministry that the Board are of opinion that metal fancy buttons, whether for use as ornaments or as buttons, would be included within the scope of the trade.The Board resolved to issue a Notice of Proposal to reduce the minimum rates of wages for all male and female workers, excluding home workers, by 12j per cent.; but they decided that, subject to their obligation to consider all objections, they would not proceed with the proposal if the cost-of-living index number had not fallen, at the time for actually varying the rates, to 115 or below.Rope, Twine and Net Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board considered the question of evasions of payment of the rates, and also a letter from the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers with reference to the Bury Rope and Twine Co., stating that this firm(b 17329T) 3H 2Needle, Fish-Hooh, Fishing Tackle and Allied Trades. The department are informed that the reductions in wages of male and female workers proposed at a meeting of the Wages Committee, and subsequently endorsed by the Industrial Council, have been submitted by the union representatives to their members and have been accepted, with a recommendation that the agreed reductions should become operative on the first pay-day in May.Glass. The Industrial Council, on the 6th May, accepted the proposals of the Executive Committee on the question of the secretaryship. The Council further con-sidered the amendment of the constitution necessitated by the dissolution of one of the federated unions, and the trade union seats were re-allotted in a proportion apparently satisfactory to those concerned.PROFESSIONAL WORKERS.Entertainments. The Executive Committee of the Industrial Council met on the 3rd May. There was considerable discussion on the policy which the industry should adopt in relation to the Entertainments Tax. The committee considered that the question was one on which the industry as a whole should have an agreed policy, and a resolution was passed referring the matter to the full Council. It was stated that the Actors&apos; Association would be prepared to join the Council again, provided that they could be assured of two extra seats on the Executive Committee. The general feeling was that this claim could be met, and a resolution was passed instructing the trade union side of the Council to get into touch with the Actors&apos; Association.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Industrial Relations will be found also on pages 412 to 417, 421, 422 and 427.]
General Department-continued.had recently attempted to intimidate their workers into voting in favour of a reduction in rates of wages. It was decided to bring to the notice of the Ministry both the general question of evasion of rates and the particular case of this firm.With regard to a request for a definition of shrink netting the Board decided that shrink netting meant tapered netting.The employers agreed to take steps through their Federation to recommend the firms in the various associations that, in order to relieve the present suffering due to short time, all firms should attempt to work at least four days in the week.The Administrative Committee considered a letter from the Ministry on the subject of the applicability of rates fixed for processes preparatory to rope-making, to workers engaged in similar processes when preparatory to the making of cord, and decided to inform the Ministry that their intention in fixing these rates was to make them applicable only to workers engaged in an actual rope factory.In connection with the definition of line lapping the committee decided to inform the Ministry that a line was any cord under lj inches in circumference, and consequently the rates fixed for line lapping would apply to all workers engaged in the laying out of stands for the making of all kinds of cord under lj inches in circumference.FIXING AND VARIATION OF MINIMUM RATES OF WAGES.Shirtmahing Trade Board (Ireland). The Minister has made an Order, dated the 29th April, confirming general minimum time-rates and piece-work basis time-rates for male and female workers, and general minimum piece-rates for home workers, as fixed or varied by the Board, and has specified the 6th May as the date from which these rates should become effective.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Trade Boards will also be found on pages 420, 425 and 427.]EMPLOYMENT AND INSURANCE DEPARTMENT.EMPLOYMENT EXCHANGES.The Unemployment Position.The following table shows the work of the Exchanges in respect of registrations vacancies and placings during the week ending the 29th April: 	Men.

Any improvement in the industrial outlook in these circumstances is entirely out of the question, and failing a favourable turn in the dispute, the rate of increase in unemployment is likely to be accelerated within the next week or two owing to the exhaustion of fuel supplies.
14.5.21.Men&apos;s Employment,Iron and Steel. In Scotland, most of the ironworks in the Coatbridge district have wholly suspended operations. Shorfc-time working is extending in all the tube works. At Mother well, the Etna Iron &amp; Steel Co., employing 400 workpeople, are closing down, but at Renfrew, Messrs. Babcock &amp; Wilcox, Ltd., Messrs. W. Simons &amp; Co., Ltd., and Messrs. Lobnitz &amp; Co., Ltd., are still carrying on. Engineering works in Partick are also still working. At Dundee two foundries, employing approximately 1,500 workers, are restrict-ing their working time to three days per week.Six hundred men have been discharged for an indefinite period from an engineering works at Bishop Auckland, and at Elswick a further batch of 500 to 600 men have been suspended by Sir W. G. Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co., Ltd. Unemployment in Middles-brough is very serious, and discharges from firms in this district during the week approximate to 1,000 men.All large firms in Sheffield are suspending workmen in considerable numbers. Messrs. had fields, Ltd., have suspended another batch of 900 workmen. At Scunthorpe, the Frodingham Iron &amp; Steel Co., Ltd., are closing down. A firm of textile machinists at Bolton, employing 3,000 workers, have closed down indefinitely, and other engineering firms in this area are making drastic cuts in working hours.In the West Midlands area, restrictions in employment are in the direction of increased short-time working rather than total suspensions. Manufacturers in -the Smethwick area, however, are contemplating a prolonged stoppage at Whitsuntide. At Dudley, Messrs. Cochrane &amp; Co., Ltd., who employ about 500 men, have re-opened their foundries and machine shop.Further discharges have been made by the British Mannesmann Tube Co., Ltd., and Messrs. Baldwins, Ltd;, at Landore, and the Morriston &amp; Midland Tinplate Works, Morriston. The Pontypool Works, Ltd., tinplate manufacturers, have closed down, but at Swansea the Cwmfelin Steel and Tinplate Co., Ltd., who have been closed for over a month, have restarted 300 workmen.Shipbuilding and Allied Industries. On the Clyde, shipyards are not yet materially affected by the coal stoppage, but very little new work is coming in. Messrs. Hawthorne, Leslie &amp; Co., and Messrs. Palmers, Shipbuilding &amp; Iron Co., Ltd., Hebburn, and Messrs. Swan, Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson, Ltd., Wallsend, have reduced their working time to four days per week. At North Shields ship-repair work is very depressed, and at South-wick three firms have discharged their remaining employees, numbering about 400. At Thornaby one firm paid off 400 workmen during the week, and discharges from another yard are imminent.On the Mersey the reconditioning of steamers is being carried out in a number of repairing shops on a small scale, but owners are at present reluctant to extend their orders in this connection. In South Wales, there is little work being done in the yards at Newport. At Swansea the improvement reported last week is being maintained, but the prospects of a continuance are not good as the jobs are of a casual nature.Textiles and Clothing. The hosiery trade is slacker as the result of a number of firms making further restrictions in working hours. At Brigliouse a large carpet-manufacturing firm Have closed a section of their works, involving 330 workpeople. Two large jute mills at Dundee, and one at Aberdeen, have closed down owing to a shortage of fuel.In the cotton trade the chief hindrance to increased activitv is now the uncertain position in regard to fuel supplies. Manufacturers in many districts are stated to be booking an increasing number of orders, and numerous inquiries for cloth for the Eastern markets are reported to be coming to hand.The improvement in the boot and shoe trade at Northampton continues, and a few firms have resumed full-time working. Boot firms in the Mansfield district, however, who in the ordinary course would now be on full time, have been compelled, owing to the restriction of power, to work only three days a week.Miscellaneous Trades-Copper mills at Swansea, employing 400 men, have suspended operations^ and the Crown Copper Mills, Garston, have now completely closed down their establishment,In the Stourbridge district most brickworks are at a standstill, and at Peterborough it is anticipated that the majority of the larger firms will close down during next week. At Coatbridge all brickworks are closed. In the glass trade, Messrs. Redfearns, Barnsley, have suspended practically all their workmen, and at Castleford, Wakefield and St, Helens, glass bottle making has now almost entirely ceased.  Glass works at Stourbridge are also(b 17329T) 3 H 3
in a precarious state, and there is every indication that fuel supplies will not carry them on for more than a week or ten days.In the railway wagon building trade 1,000 men are unemployed at Wakefreld, 350 at Basford, 60 at Ilkeston, and 265 men and boys at Wednesbury.In the pottery trade only one firm are now working in the Burslem, Hanley, and Longton districts. At Derby, the Royal Crown Porcelain Co., Ltd., employing 200 workers, have closed down, and all earthenware and pottery works at Swadlincote are idle.Fishing at Aberdeen and Wick is seriously affected by insufficient supplies of bunker coal. At the latter port motor boats are being fitted up, but their employment will be contingent upon the facilities for despatching fish to market. The position at Grimsby and Lowestoft is unchanged, bub at Boston and Milford Haven, more trawlers have put to sea.At Belvedere, Kent, 2,500 workpeople were discharged by the Callenders Cable and Construction Co., Ltd., on the 30th April, and at Enfield, Messrs. Edison-Swan, Ltd., are reducing hands gradually. At Grays the Thames Paper Co., Messrs. Jurgens, Ltd., and the cement firms are all held up for coal.In the Metropolitan area the effects of the coal stoppage are becoming more apparent. Firms in the Canning Town area affected by the coal shortage are the India Rubber, Gutta Percha, and Telegraph Works Co., Ltd., Messrs. A. T. Morse &amp; Sons, the Lamson Paragon Supply Co., Messrs. Estler Bros., the British Alizarine Co., and Venesta, Ltd. At Shep-hercTs Bush, the Osram Robertson Lamp Works, Ltd., electrical engineers, have reduced their horns of working to six per day. The number of carpenters, painters and plumbers out of employment is increasing daily, and the possibility of placing men in these trades is at present very remote. The decorating trade is quieter than it has been at this period for a considerable number of years.Transport. On the Clyde, the Clyde Trust Rothesay Docks have discharged 100 men during the week. At Leith, unemployment among seamen is increasing owing to short supplies of bunker coal. On the Mersey the position is growing worse ; it is expected that during the week coasting services will be considerably reduced, and this will necessarily throw a further number of seamen on the unemployed list. The position at Hull and at South Wales ports is unchanged.Women&apos;s Employment.Local]Reports. The North-Western Division report that the situation is becoming rapidly worse. Many employers who have been working short time are now obliged to close down altogether, while others are increasing the number of days and hours during which work is at a standstill. There is a slight improvement, however, in the habting industry at Denton, and women in the tailoring, tobacco and export brewery industries at Liverpool have resumed work. In the Bootle district unemployment is increasing. Nearly 700 workers have been suspended from the new Liverpool Kubber Company.Blackpool report that the industrial crisis is interfering with seasonal work.In the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division improvements in the cotton, making-up, and clothing trades are checked by the coal stoppage. The rug weaving trade is very depressed at Dewsbury, and the rag trade is at a standstill. Keports from the lace centres indicate that the position in this trade is worse than ever. The hosiery and clothing trades continue slack.In the South Midlands and Eastern Division the wholesale clothing industry at Colchester, Kettering and Norwich is feeling the effects oi. the stoppage. The booc industry remains seriously depressed at Leicester and Norwich, bub at Northampton full time has been started by a number of firms. The silk industry remains depressed at Norwich and St. Albans. -The shortage of fuel continues severely to affect the staple industries in the West Midlands Division; the pottery trade is almost entirely at a standstill, and many metal workers are unemployed. General unemployment is increasing and short time is general. At Aston and Coventry the motor and cycle trade is severely depressed. The metal industries at Smethwick, Sparkhill and West Bromwich are also slack; rubber workers are unemployed at Aston ; needle-makers are on short time at Redditch; and the silk industry is depressed at Leek.In London, unemployment and short time are still general, and high live registers continue to be reported from the industrial centres. The clothing, paper, confectionery, tin box, leather and chemical trades are affected.
In the South-Western Division and in Wales all industries are being affected by the stoppage and unemployment is abnormal.The situation in the Northern Division shows little change, the trade showing the largest amount of unemployment being the paper industry. Hotel services are said to be feeling the effects of the dispute, and vacancies are being cancelled. Many hotels have little fuel, especially at Kendal and in the Lake District.Scotland report that industrial depression is general and accentuated by the coal dispute.  There is a slight temporary improvement, however, in the jute industry at Dundee.LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Unemployment Insurance. The Eastbourne Committee are of opinion that it is not desirable that ex-Service men, who have not been employed on insurable work, should be paid benefit from the existing funds, but that, in order to alleviate any distress to such men while unemployed, the Government should set up a special fund to cover such cases. Torquay suggest that, in view of the large amount of unemployment, and the ease with which the regulations can be evaded, the department should appoint inspectors whose whole duty would be to see that the Acts are not abused.Women&apos;s Work The Women&apos;s Sub-Committee at Bath call attention to the returning by the Dominions, on medical grounds, of people who had obtained grants for overseas settlement, and suggest that the medical examination should be standardised, so that no person passed in this country as fit would be refused by the authorities overseas.DISCHARGED  AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.National Scheme.Up to and including the 2nd of May, 25,178 certificates have been issued to employers under the scheme. The undertakings given by these employers cover 279,533 disabled ex-Service men.The general position with regard to the placing of disabled men in employment has not improved, but the figures shown, on the disabled register are not increasing proportionately to the increase on the ordinary register. The prospective restriction of Government contracts to firms on the King&apos;s Roll, save in exceptional circumstances, is already having a marked influence in inducing contracting firms to enrol.JUVENILE BRANCH.Stamped or Pressed Metal Wares. A deputation appointed by the Birmingham Juvenile Employment Committee recently attended a meeting of the Administrative Committee of the Stamped or Pressed Metal Wares Trade Board to discuss the general question of juvenile employment in the trade. It was pointed out that the trade offered little scope for training, and although the representatives of the Juvenile Employment Committee pressed for the introduction of definite training in as many branches of the trade as possible, the Administrative Committee felt that it was not within their power to lay down regulations for the training of young workers. It was,finally decided, however, that a memorandum should be prepared for distribution amongst employers, pointing out the desirability of definite courses of training, and inviting them to co-operate with Exchanges with regard to the supply of juvenile labour.Apprenticeship : Grocery. A representative of the branch recently visited the secretary of the Institute of Certificated Grocers to discuss the possibility of co-operation in con-nection with the instituted scheme of -apprenticeship. The secretary lias agreed to give lectures to juveniles in a limited number of areas during July, and Juvenile Employment Committees wishing to arrange meetings for this purpose are being invited to make application for his services. It is hoped that in this way publicity will be given to the scheme which will result in a larger number of entrants to the trade.[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment and Insurance Department will also be found on pages 412, 413, 421, 427 and 428.]
APPOINTMENTS AND TRAINING.APPOINTMENTS AND CIVIL LIABILITIES DEPARTMENT.APPOINTMENTS.Statistics. During the week ending the 29th April the department placed 334 candidates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 54,234. Of these, 7,131 have been placed through the agency of the depart-departments Interviewing Boards. Applications were registered from 589 ex-Service men and 29 civilians. The number of candidates available for appointments on the 29th April was 11,154 ex-Service men and 1,254 civilians. At the same date 876 &quot; live &quot; vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 335 having been registered during the week.BUSINESS  AND  PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.Business Training Scheme. During the week ending the 29th April, the department received 47 applications for training under this scheme, bringing the total number of applications to 3,235, of which 1,739 have since been cancelled. Grants have been sanctioned in 720 cases. At the same date 320 vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 24 having been registered during the week.Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions&apos; Warrant. The department have dealt with a total of 1,192 cases, in 518 of which the training sanctioned is provided by the Appointments Department, and in the remainder by other Government departments. Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed training in 327 cases, and abandoned training in 45; 114 are still in training, and 32 are awaiting training.TRAINING DEPARTMENT. INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men.Statistics. On the 3rd May, 24,376 men were in training, as against 24,422 on the 26th April and 24,502 on the 5th April. During the week 437 men were placed in training. There were 16,491 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 26th April and the 5th April being 16,575 and 16,604. The number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 31,049, the totals for the 26th April and the 5th April being 30,566 and 29,219.Manual Training Teachers. Training schemes for manual instructors are now being very successfully developed. A start has now been made at the Westminster College, and 60 men are to begin their course at Loughborough immediately, while Springfield College is already full. The men at Westminster and Springfield have already been visited by representatives of the Board of Education, who give a good report of the men.Exhibitions. On the 30th April the Minister presided at the opening of the Printing and Allied Trades Exhibition. Two stands were erected illustrating the scope of the departments scheme for training in the printing trades. One stand was confined wholly to work produced by the School at the St. Bride&apos;s Institute, and, on the second, exhibits of lithography, photo-engraving, colour work and bookbinding from the Bristol; Leicester, and Manchester Centres were displayed. Judging by the inquiries that have been received this exhibition reaches a very large public.Many inquiries made at the Building Trades Exhibition are still being followed up; it is known that 17 men have been definitely placed in situations as a result.Government Instructional Factories. During the past week the decrease in the number of men in training has been checked, and the total stands at just under 10,800.A special meeting of the Local Technical Advisory Committee of the plumbing trade has been convened for the purpose of passing as many men for training as possible, and filling up the class at the Romford Factory, in view of the closing of the lists for the plumbing trade at the end of the month.
Appointments and Training-continued.National Trade Advisory Committees: Vehicle Building. At a meeting on the 29th April, a resolution was unanimously adopted recommending the department to close down training in this trade, owing to the depression in trade, and in view of the fact tha&quot; the number of men now in training has reached the quota originally agreed upon as tin number of men which could be absorbed. A resolution was also passed recommendin; that, in case of dismissal due to trade depression, trainees should be subject to the same conditions as apprentices.Women&apos;s Training.War Widoivs. There have been 60 fresh applications for training during April, of which a very large proportion have proved to be valid. Seventy-four courses of training have been sanctioned and 109 widows have commenced training, making a total of 680 at present in training. There are 261 cases under consideration. In 139 cases sanction has been given, but training has not yet begun.In connection with dressmaking training generally, it has been agreed with the Trade Board concerned that where training cannot be given in a technical institute or special class, war widows may be placed as pupils in workrooms, on a fee per head basis, provided that they work entirely on their own materials and retain the garments made. This arrangement, which has been sanctioned by the Treasury, will considerably facilitate training in the smaller towns.Disabled Nurses. There have been 14 fresh applications for training during April. The panel has sanctioned training in nine cases including three extensions of secretarial courses. Five nurses have completed their training and four have been obliged by ill-health to withdraw temporarily from training.Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics. Up to the 4th May agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 46,269 apprentices, under the 41 schemes approved. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 44,158 apprentices, employed by 17,567 employers. The total mrmber of agreements lapsed on expiration of the appropriate period of training or by mutual agree-ment between the parties is now 24,015.Acceptance or Non-Acceptance. The North British. Railway Company, Glasgow, have finally agreed to bring their apprentices under the scheme. Every assistance will be given to get the matter put through as quickly as possible. The apprentices, however, are scattered throughout the country, and a little time will elapse before the initial steps to bring them under the relevant schemes are completed. Moreover, many of the apprentices have become journeymen and, in some cases, are no longer employed by the company.Unemployment. Apprentices in the pottery industry have already lost considerable time, not only on account of the excessive unemployment arising from the coal dispute, but through slackness of trade during the recent months. The secretary of the Joint Industrial Council has been assured that every consideration will be given to apprentices under the scheme to obtain an extension of the period of apprenticeship.General Training:Apprenticeship; Building.-Th.e special meeting of the North Shields, Tynemouth. and Wfiitley Bay Apprenticeship Committee, to which, all members of the employers&apos; and operatives&apos; organisations were invited, was held on the 22nd April and was well attended. An explanation of the national scheme was given, followed by a considerable amount of discussion on the chief points, namely, technical education, the fourth party to the indenture and the facilities for technical training in the district. At the meeting of the committee for Walsall, on the 19th April, there was only a small attendance.The joint conference of employers and operatives arranged for Stafford was attended by operatives only, who, however, snowed a keen interest in the scheme. Their secretary is, apparently, a man with advanced views on social reform, and it is thought that this may, in part, account for the unwillingness of the employers to meet the operatives. There has been no desire, however, on the part of the employers to identify themselves with the Joint Industrial Council, and only recently have they become members of the Midland Federation of Employers.
Appointments and Training-continued.At Leicester, the operatives have already indicated their willingness to elect representatives on the committee. The secretary of the master builders&apos; association also states that he can see no obstacle in the way of setting up the committee.The recent meeting of employers at Newcastle was very successful. Marked interest was shown concerning the provisions for technical training. A resolution was passed recommending the national scheme to the various associations for adoption. At this meeting representatives of the Board of Education, and of the county and local educational authorities, were present.[Reference to matters of interest to the Appointments and Training Departments will also be found on pages 413 and 425.]//
