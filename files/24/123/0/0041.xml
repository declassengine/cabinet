ihx 7/3RITAOIC MAXpT^B WWmmtf)..18 DCCUK.TT IS TR&quot; PROPERTY OE HIS,S C R IT.C A &quot;3 I K S TcP. 2936.(Memorandum^by the Chancellor of the Exchequer).On the 9th instant the Cabinet decided not to proceed with the National Insurance&apos; (Forces af the Crown) Bill (Cabinet 34 (21), Conclusion (2).   This decision was taken on the view that a discussion in the House of Commons would raise questions which might have the effect of creating disaffection among the Reservists, who might be led to consider that they were being denied their legal rights.   It is however possible to adopt an alternative method which-may not be regarded as open to this objection.   The alternative method of procedure would be the issue by the Treasury of an Order under Section 41 (2) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, reducing the number of con-tributions to be credited to each man on his discharge at the end of the emergency from 90 to 24, which would provide 4 weeks benefit, instead of 15.Section 41 (2) is as follows&quot;The fixed number of contributions for the purposes of this Section shall be 90 unless the Treasury are at any time of opinion that having regard to the sums payable to the Unemployment 3und under this Section it is necessary to fix some lower numbern. The Law Officers have advised that such an Order can be limited in time so as to cover only the period of the emergency but cannot be limited in scope.   That is t0/4ay it must   apply not only to Reservists and members of the Jefence Force but to regular soldiers, sailors and airmen discharged during the period, in question.   Administrative arrangements can, however, be made without difficulty under which the Service Departments will in the latter cases (which will be few.) pay
the full 90 contributions, so that these men will not be damnified.The Order would be published in the Gazette but would not have to be presented to Parliament.It is considered that if the men are credited with 24 contributions this will fully meet the requirements of the case.   The men in question are practically all ex-soldiers who have already received on their discharge from the Colours either out of work donation or ,90 contributions.   Special arrangements have also been made under the Unemployment Insurance Act 1921 for conferring additional benefits on the insured population generally during the present period of trade depression.   It is probable that owing to the limitation of the number of weeks benefit which can be drawn in any one year, the contributions with, which these men will be credited on their discharge will in the great majority of cases not be . drawn upon in the near future but will be carried over into 1922.The effect cf the Order would be to reduce the amount to be paid by the Service Departments as employers ton  7 to about  2 per head with a corresponding reduction of the amount to, be paid by the State as such, and to reduce expendi-ture on Unemployment Insurance from  1,400,000 to  400,000, a saving of  1,000,000.The arrangement actually made with regard to Health Insurance can be allowed to stand.In the circumstances I do not consider- that the additional expenditure of  1,000,000 involved in letting things take their course would be justified.   Tho Order cannot be applied retro-respecively but the discharges to date have been few.o-  .c -
A.decision is urgently required since the Order ifissued at all must he issued before-diechargeaJ)egin-on if-any/ considerable scale,-    (intld.)   R,S,H*Treasury, S.\7,My 12th, 1921.
