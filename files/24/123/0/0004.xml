GENERAL.The continuance of the stoppage of the coal-mines is having increasingly serious effects on industry. Further large discharges have taken place from the iron and steel industries and also from engineering firms, while unemployment is increasing among pottery workers. Shipbuilding is still very slack, more especially on the Clyde. The improvement in the cotton trade continues, and it is reported that only the shortage of fuel prevents a marked revival in this industry. At Northampton there has been an improvement in the boot and shoe trade in spite of the coal shortage, but in the woollen industry several firms which have been working short-time are expected to close down entirely until coal supplies are available. In the London area the only large discharge of workpeople reported is at Canning Town, where 3,000 employees of the rubber and gutta percha works have been stood off. Work in the docks is very slack in all parts of the country.II. EMERGENCY WORK.As announced by the Prime Minister on the 19th October, certain schemes have been put in hand by the Local Authorities in conjunction with the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Health, and by the Local Authorities themselves, designed to secure work for unemployed men, preferentially ex-Service men. The following is the result at this date: (a.) New Arterial Roads.20,412 men employed up to date (in and around London, 2,286; Provinces, 18,126).(b.) Road Maintenance.It is estimated that employment has been provided for approximately 20,000 over and above those ordinarily so employed.(c.) Housing (Acceleration of the Lay-Govt of Roads and Sewers and Approved Housing Schemes).Men employed up to date, 3,526 (in and around London, 534; Provinces, 2,992).(d.) Lord St. David&apos;s Committee.Men employed on work other than the above up to date, 29,708 (in and around London, 6,216; Provinces, 23,492).(e.) Alternative Work in Government Establishments.War Office establishments: men employed up to date, 2,794 (in and around London, 1,954; Provinces, 840).Alternative work provided in Admiralty establishments: men employed up to date, 5,772 (in and around London, nil; Provinces, 5,772).(f.) Short-Time in Government Establishments.Number of men who have found employment up to date as a result of the intro-duction of short-time system : men employed up to (fate : War Office establishments, 2,347 (in and around London, 2,148; Provinces, 199); Admiralty establishments, 5,001 (in and around London, 207; Provinces, 4,794).(g.) Office of Works Emergency Programme.Total number of men employed at present time as a result of the bringing forward of decorating and repair work in Government Departments by the Office of Works, 406 (in.and around London, 113; Provinces, 293).(h.) Emergency Work found by Local Authorities.Total number of men employed up to date, 8,743 (in and around London, 2,717; Provinces.. 6,026).[6189]
(i.) Housing.On the 1st April there were 63,230 skilled men employed on housing schemes in England and Wales and 56,151 unskilled.[The additional labour still required was 9,690 skilled men and 484 unskilled.]Total labour employed on above schemes=218,090.As reports for the week ended the 22nd April have been received from only 332 Local Authorities out of 375 who were asked to supply information, it is probable that the Relief Schemes which have been inaugurated by the Government and by Local Authorities are finding employment for a number of men in excess of the figures given.III. 50,000 EX-SERYICE MEN TO BE TRAINED IN THE BUILDINGINDUSTRY.The Employers&apos; Associations are taking steps to set up throughout the country the District Committees which are to be established to select the applicants and allocate them to the trades in which they can be trained most suitably. The number of applications received to date totals 8,368. In the London and South-Eastern Division 4,290 men have applied, and the following are the figures for other divisions: South Midlands and Eastern Counties, 545; South-Western Counties, 546; West Midlands, 770; Yorkshire and East Midlands, 913; North-Western Counties, 688; Northern Division, 149; Scotland, 390; Wales, 77.Only a few applicants have so far been actually accepted under the scheme, and some time must elapse before the District Committees can complete their work of selecting and allocating candidates.IV.   PAYMENT OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT AND OUT-OF-WORKDONATION.1. The following statement represents the position as shown by the Exchangeregisters on the 22nd April:-	Men.	Women.
