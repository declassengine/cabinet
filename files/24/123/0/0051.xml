This Document is the Property oL&apos; / His Britannic Majesty^ Government m      yd[bsBgi^AQSa prpinch embassy in londonWin 111X4)1 -Id r-memandum PROr M. briand toMR, lloyd george, 3PARIS, May 14, 1921.The President of the Council has received from the British Ambassador a memorandum which he has taken cognizance of with as much surprise as Regret,  This memorandum, on the basis of reports that have appeared in the English and French press, gives an inaccurate picture of the part played &quot;by the French troops and of the policy of the French Government in Upper Silesia, The French Government is fully alive to the serioue-ness of the events that have taken place in Upper Silesia, and, like the British Government, has never wavered in the conviction that the only possible solution is to apply the Treaty of Versailles in the letter and in the spirit.Without attempting in any way to palliate the polish insurrection, it cannot be denied that the original cause of the present disturbances was the precipitancy with which the allied High Commissioners were instructed to draw up in a few days, and to send to the Supreme Council at London, their recommenda-tions as to the partition of Upper Silesia involved by the plebiscite. &apos; No time was allowed them to reach unanimity as to the solution to be imposed, and, meanwhile, the polish workmen in the mining district had &quot;been over excited by confidential German hints to the effect that the whole industrial area was to be allotted to Germany.    When the.first news of the disturbances was received the French Government, even in London and on every subsequent day, actedwith/
with the utmost decision both at Warsaw and at Oppeln, At Warsaw the French Government invited the Polish Govern ment to dissociate itself publicly from the insurrection by taking the most energetic measures against every form of polish participation.  At Oppeln, the French Govern-ment supported the measures taken against the insurgents by the allied Commission at the orders of General De Marinis.   It is only fair to recognize that the Polish Government replied to the allied communications by per-feebly definite declarations and by strictly closing the frontier.At the Conference of Ambassadors the French repre-sentatives spontaneously associated themselves with the representations made at Warsaw.   In Silesia the allegation-tions made against the French troops are so far from true that they, like the Italian troops, have failed in no respect to do their duty.   They have suffered casualties in dead and wounded, and have exerted all their influence on the Poles to bring disorder and violence within the narrowest limits possible.The Allied commission, in the absence of General Lerond and since his return, has acted unanimously without renouncing its authority in any respect, and without entering into any compact of any sort with the insurgents.   The course it has adopted has been not only the wisest, but the only possible one.   While bringing pressure on Korfanty to put an end to acts of pillage and prevent the development of the insurrection, and also to- prevent direct conflict between the German and polish bands at their points of Gontact, the french general/
General has never, anymore than his colleagues, recom-mended the acceptance of the fait accompli nor con-eluded an armistice with the insurgents.   These prelim-inary measures, rendered imperative as they were by the weakness of the allied troops, outnumbered ten to one by the insurgents, have made it possible for the Commission to proceed to its subsequent task and, after bringing the evil within limits, restoring tranquillity and facilitating the resumption of work, to undertake the liberation of the territory occupied by the insurgents, with the object of re-establishing the normal solution laid down by the treaty.   The latest reports indicate that the situation is improving progressively, thanks to the exertions of the allied commissioners.    But this is only possible if, on the other hand, no en-encouragement is given by the allies themselves to the Germans, who are disseminating mendacious and tendacious news all over the world, are organising troops that are drawn even from Bavaria, and are despatching greater numbers every day to the Silesian frontier, which remains open, and are making ready to pass from threats to deeds upon the smallest sign of public disagreement between the allies0The French Government has shown the utmost patience in the face of the insults heaped upon its troops by the German bands, and of the arrest of officers and generals, such as Captain Deblois and General Gratier.   The French Government has con-fined itself to drawing the most serious attention of the German Government to its responsibilities. At the present moment the main danger is from theGerman/
Gorman side, and it would &quot;be highly imprudent on tho part of the allies not to take joint action at Berlin, as they have done at Warsaw,&apos; The Conference of Ambassadors, aware of this, has so decided;   out up to the present the British Ambassador has not received the necessary instructions.  A policy which, in accordance with the possibility contemplated at the end of the British memorandum, should consist in allowing the German Government to reply by force to the local insurrection in Silesia, would have the most formidable consequences and would travel far beyond the present dangers, which are still capable of being conjured by the common effort of the allies. The action taken by the Poles, deplorable though it be, is limited;   for it proceeds from within Silesia and represents an upheaval of the population of the mining area, which (as the plebiscite has shown) contains a large Polish majority, while up to the present the Polish Government; who are keep-ing the frontier closed, haVe taken no part in the movement, whether by despatching troops or by letting volunteers cross the frontier.There is still good hope of coping with the movement by reinforcing the action of the Commis-sion and by bringing continuous pressure to beartakenat V/warsaw.   To countenance direct action/by theGerman Government and organised outside Silesia inaorder to impose/forcible solution of the Silesia problem, would be a violation of the principles of the plebiscite and of the decisions of the Treaty . of Versailles, which would have incalculableresults/
results.   It would at once bring Poland upon the scene directly and with justification, and would put in question once more all the results of the war, including the re-establishment of the Polish state, which was one of the essential acts of justice for which the allies fought.   It would not be possible for Prance, or for any of the,powers, to look on passively,The precarious position of the Upper Silesia Commission and its inability to suppress so wide-spread an insurrection by force was inevitable,. The reason is that the troops which were recognised as necessary by the allies, and which were to have been supplied in equal shares by the four powers, have been reduced to French and Italian troops alone by the abstention of the United States and Great Britain herself.   It is not just to leave one or two Powers to bear by themselves responsibilities and burdens which ought to have been shared among all the allies, and then to reproach them with their powerlessness, and even to question their impartiality.,The solution suggested by the British Govern-ment - namely, to anticipate the decision of the ( Commission and of the.allied Governments as regards the final frontier-by allowing the Germans to occupy forthwith the greater part of Silesia, while con-fining the poles to a small corner of the industrial area - was entirely impracticable.   It was not . founded on the treaty, and from a military point of view it could not have been carried out, for force would/
would have been required to impose it, and it would have brought the Germans and the Poles into direct con-conflict.  Par from stopping the insurrection it would have made it general by penning the allied troops into a trap.  Consequently the Inter-allied Military Corn-mi ttee have unanimously rejected it on grounds which are primarily military.The president of the Council has observed with extreme and justified surprise that the British Govern-ment attributes to him, on the basis of newspaper articles, a policy that consists in assigning the whole industrial area to Poland, if necessary by violence. The French Government has never authorised any news-paper to speak thus in its name.   The accusation is no more just than it would be to accuse the British Government, on the basis of articles in the English press, of  having made up its mind to assign to Germany the whole of Upper Silesia, with its hundreds of thousands of Poles, who are passionately attached to their independence and to their nationality, with-out taking into account the provisions of the treaty and the results of the plebiscite. ,In reality the French Government, like the British Government, considers that the only just and defensible basis is to adhere to the precise terms of the Treaty of Versailles, article 88 of which (para-graphs 4, 5 and 6) clearly lays down the parts to be played by the Commission and by the Governments respectively.   (Result of the vote determined by com-munes;   frontier proposed by the Commission, taking into account the wishes of the inhabitants as well as the geographical and economic situation of particularlocalities/
localities;   delivery to the German and Polish admin-istrations of the territories adjudicated as German or polish respectively.)The proofs of a conciliatory spirit which he has given and the sacrifices to which he has consented in order to allow for the difficulties and views of the British Government, and to maintain close agreement between the allies, while inducing French opinion to accept important concessions on what the French people legitimately conceive to be the rights and the in-terests of France, entitle  the president of the Council to declare with all frankness to the British prime Minister that an attitude calculated to encouragement-age&apos;Germany in her claim to the whole of Upper Silesia in defiance of the treaty would be as dangerous for peace as would be an analogous encouragement given to Poland.   Such an attitude, so far from solving, would merely increase the difficulties of the Upper Silesian question, on which the allies have already once changed their policy, since there was a moment when they were unanimously agreed to assign the whole area to Poland under the treaty which was presented to the Germans,M. Briand will be happy to bring his views, as he has always hitherto done, into harmony with those of the British Government, in order to avoid a dis-agreement from which Germany alone can profit.   But it is impossible for him to do this at the present moment, for reasons which Mr. Lloyd George will readily under-stand, before renewing contact with the French parlia-ment and obtaining its approval of the policy upon which allied agreement was reached at the last London conference.Moreover/
mMoreover, it ie essential that the allies should be careful to dissociate the Silesian problem from tho problem of reparations, if only to demonstrate the falsity of tho allegations made by the Germans that promisoe to compensate thorn in 3i3esia havo been secretly made to them. The Treaty of Versailles lays down perfectly clearly ih article 90 the positicin of such parts of Silesia as shall be ultimately trans-ferred to Poland.  It contemplates the supply to Germany of tho output of tho mines for a period of fifteen years free from duties, charges or re-restrictions on the exportation of the coal.  The Polish Government has recently completed this guarantee by consenting not merely to charge such Silosian territory as may become polish with a proportional share of liability for reparations, but to set up an allied economic and industrial control in the mining districts assigned to * Poland.  These guarantees, completing&apos; as they do those contained in the treaty^ deprive of all justification the .claim continually put forward by tho German Government, connecting the reparation question with that of Upper Silesia, and to obtain as regards the latter a revision of the Treaty of Versailles.According to the latest reports the allied commission in Upper Silesia appears to be able, provided that the allies act energetically and in strict agreement at Warsaw and at Berlin simul-taneously to stop the armed struggle between Poles and Germans, to resume the administration of the territory by breaking up the insurgent Polish bands and to present the allied Governments, who have now -been joined by tho United States, with a unanimous recommendation as to the frontier that should be laid down in accordance with the plebiscite.
