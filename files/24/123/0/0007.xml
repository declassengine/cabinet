THIS IOCUMENT IS THE PROPER CF HIS BRITMNIC majesty S GOVERNMENT.iCABINET.^ ^ ^ RAM/AYS   BILL.,  PRESENTATION OF EMPLOYEES ON BOARDS OF MaNaG&amp;BT* MEMORANDUM FOR THE Ci&amp;lKET KY THE MINISTER CF TRANSPORT.With reference to my previous Cabinet memoranda, CP.  010 and CF. 2324, and to the Cabinet decision of the 18th April 1921, (Cabinet 23 (21) Conclusion 11), when it was deoided that we should press for the inclusion of men upon the Boards of Management, I have to report with regret that the men, without much consultation with me - and that only to tell/ ifme unfortunately that they had changed their mind about the value of men en the boards - have &amp;oma to an agreement with the ....   Railway Companies which is attached as an appendix to this mencrojadum.This agreement providea for the continuance of the National 7/ngaa Board, which consists of four Trades Union representatives, four Railway representatives, and four representatives cf users - two from the employing olaas and two from the working class - with an independent Chairman. Below this National Wages Board is a Central Wages Board, consisting of five Railway representatives and five Trades Union representatives.    This has been extended by the &apos;agreomont to cover tho Clerks, and in addition they have provided by tho agreement for Railway Councils, composed of officers and employees.    They have also come to an agreement on some questions concerning discipline.The main point in this matter is that &quot;hfee men have deliberately thrown over the proposal to give them a share in tho management by placing thorn upon the Boards of the flow Group Companies.    I feel, therefore, that the Cabinet would like to
4th May. 1921,reconsider the matter as it will be practically hopeless and Indeed useless to endeavour to force upon the Bouse of Commons an arrangement which - however right we may think it * neither men nor masters desire.I need hardly say that this action of the men is a complete volte face, and is entirely contrury to what they have hitherto told me.As the Bill la to be introduced next week, I would like the early instructions of the Cabinet as to the course which 1 am to adopt.There is also for consideration the question of the placing of a Government Director on the Boards of Management which the Cabinet approved in their previous decision (Cabinet 23 (21) Conclusion 11 (d)).(Signed)   EHIC GEDDES.
