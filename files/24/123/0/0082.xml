(This Document la the Property of His Britannic Majesty[s Government.)GAB I N E T. JUNEMPLOYMENT FUND - PROPOSALS FOB. AVOIDING INSOLVENCY.RET.[75.Memorandum &quot;by tho Minister of Labour.1.   In my memorandum of 3rd May,.1 warned my colleagues of the. very serious drain upon the resources of the Unemployment Fund owing to the increasing volume of unemployment.    Under the Scheme of the Unemployment Insurance Act. 1921, we had budgeted for an average of 1,000,000 unemployed each week up to July, 1922, This ostimate has been completely falsified by the great Increase in unemployment owing directly to the ooal stoppage.    As a result we have now reached a position in which It is probable that the Unemployment Fund will bo praotioally exhausted by the end of next month.    It is therefore urgently neoessary to take action without delay in order to safeguard the solvency of tho Unemploy-ment Fund.2,   The weekly rates of benefit now areMen. 20s.Women. 16s.Boys. (16 to        10s. 18 yoars)Girls ( &quot; H n w)   8s.&apos; 3.   The weekly rates of contribution are t -Up to July 4th, 1921.Employer.      Work or.,.     State.

Under tho provisions of tho Unemployment Insurance Act, 1921, e ratoe of benefit and contribution, as from July 2nd, 1923, are revert to those fixed by the .1920 Aot, viz :-Ratos of Benefit&apos;. Men. 15s.Women. 12s.Boys, 7s. 6d.Girls. 6s.Rates of Contribution. [Those specified in paragraph 3 bb applicable up to July 4th, 1921. It has always boen intonded, however, that before July, 1923, position should bo reviewed and amending legislation passed, in light of experience, oither to maintain or to vary the then sting rates of benefits and contributions.LIMITS OE POSSIBLE AOTION. . The action that can be taken without legislation falls under following heads(a) Treasury loan (at interest) up to  10,000,000.(b) Reduction in weekly rate of benefit to a figure not lower than 17s. for men and 14s. for women, with half rates for boys and girls,     (This can be done by administrative regulations without notice or Parliamentary sanction.)(The following things (o) and (d) can only bedone on the ground of threatened insolvency andby an Order whioh must be laid before both houses and cannot come into force until a month after it ismade.)(e.) Reduction in weekly rate of benefit to a figure not lower than 15s. for men and 10s. for women, with half these rateB for boys and girls,(d) Increase in weekly contributions by an amount not exceeding Id. from employers and id, from workers.
6.   Among the steps which should be considered but which would rejaj^L^O^islaAd^n are:-(i)   An increase in the maximum amount of the Treasury loan.(ii)   Substitution of a six-day &quot;waiting period&quot; for the present three-day &quot;waiting period &apos;.(iii)   An increase beyond 2d in the amount by which the joint weekly contributions may be raised.7.   In framing proposals 1 do not think we can safely budget for a lower number than l  millions unemployed on the average each week up to July, 1922.   The estimated number unemployed week by-week between July, 1920 and July, 1921, is 1,250,000, the average for the first six months being 500,000 a week, and for the second six months 2,000,000 a week.   To pay benefit at the present rndes and under present conditions on an assumed number of If ml 1Id.on unemployed each week up to July, 1922, would result in a deficit of  29,000,000 (or  19,000,000 in excess of the existing borrowing powers of the Fund.)     It is obvious, therefore, that some remedy must be applied.ALTERNATIVE COURSES OF ACTION. 8.   There appear to be three practicable courses open:-I.Notwithstanding the increased rates of contributions that will come into automatic effect on 4th July, 1921, (see paragraph 3), to reduce the weekly rates of benefit to 15/- for men and 12/- forwomen with half rates for boys and girls, adopt a six-day waiting period, and provide for a Treasury loan up to  20,000,000.This would result in a deficit (to be covered by the Treasury-loan) amounting.to  13,800,000 at July, 1922.   Assuming normal unemployment (i.e. rather more than 500,000 unemployed on the average each week) after that date and the continuance of the reduced benefit,/the
the deficit would be paid off in two yoars from July. 1922, provided that the contributions under the 1921 Act are continued after July. 1923, (see paragraph 4). by an amendment of that Aotj if this Is not done, the deficit would be paid off in about Bix years from July. 1923.II.^^^V..^l.J^0^weekly .benefit      20s. for men and 16s, for women with half rates for boys and girls, adopt a six-day waiting period; increase the joint weekly contribution for   adults by 4d. (2d. from employer and 2d. from worker)and half this amount for boys and ffirls over and above tho increased rates of contributions that will oome into^autcmatic effect on 4th July. 1921* (see paragraph .,3), and provide for a Treasury loan up to  20,000.000.This would result in a deficit (to be covered by the Treasury loan) amounting to  17^250,000 at July, 1922.   Assuming normal unemployment after that date and the continuance of the full contributions as thus increased, the deficit would bo paid off in two years or lees from July, 1922.The increase of 4d. in the joint contribution of employers and workers would involve a net increase of  1,000.000 per annum in the state contribution to the Unemployment Fund.III.To reduce the weekly rate of benefit to 18s. for men and 14s. for women, with half rates for boys and girls, adopt a six-day waiting periods inc^easo the Joint weekly contribution for adults by 2d. (Id(, from employer and Id. from worker) and half this amount for boys and girls^ over and above the increased rates of contribution that will come into automatio effect on 4th July,1921; (see paragraph 5)? and provide for a Treasury loan up to  20,000*000//This
This would result In a deficit (to be covered by the Treasury loan) amounting to  16,500,000 at July, 1922.    Assuming normal unemployment after that date and the oontlnuanoe of the Increase of 2d. in the joint contribution, the dofioit would be paid off in about two years from July, 1922.The inoreaee of 2d. in the joint contribution of employers and workers would involve an increase of fi500,000 per annum in the State contribution to the Unemployment Fund.OOURSE   RECOMMENDED. 9. After very oareful consideration I am strongly of opinion that proposal III should be adopted.    The reduction in the weekly rate of benefit would be made by administrative regulation whioh I propose should oomo into operation Immediately after the coal dispute ia feottlod.    The indreaso in contributions retires a months notice and the laying of the Order4 beforo ParliamenttIt is imperative in order to avoid serious loss of revenue owing to failure to affix proper stamps, that tho Increase should eome into force at the beginning of the next Insurance year (July 4th next.    Not only therefore must the necessary Order be made not later than June 4th but new stamps of tho proper denominations must bo on sale by July 4th.    These stamps oar only be prepared in time by means of over-printing and, even so, time is so short that they cannot be ready by, July 4th unless instructions for their preparation are given at once.i mtmwmtmwmmmmmi  m  n m ******mw*mm *** 1m     ***** mm *wThe inoreaee in borrowing powers and the ohange in the waiting period requiro legislation which would take the form of a short Bill )f two or three clauses and would afford a convenient opportunity )f explaining in tho House the administrative action taken on the )ther points,/Accordingly
According to the best estimate which I have been able to obtain, Proposal III should place the fund in a position to continue payment of benefit and, apart from the increased loan, will involve the Treasury in no other charge than the increased State contribution arising from the 2d, increase in the joint contribution irom employers and workers, estimated at about  500,000 per annum, tfor so long as the increase is operative. Should the amount of unemployment prove to be higher than is estimated it would be possible by Order laid before Parliament to reduce the weekly rate of benefit to 15e* for men and 12su for women,10,   I accordingly ask for authority to adopt Proposal III and to take the necessary action for bringing it into effect,(SIGHED)   T. J. MACJMMRA.26th May, 1921.
