/1 fS E 0 RET,&quot;&quot; Oopy 11 o.0.P.-2995.C A B I HE TtREPORT OF AORICULT13RE APT COMMITTEE. (Reference^ Cabinet 38(21), Oonolusion 3.)The Oommittee were appointed by the Cabinet on May 11th1921, to consider and   *, advise on a memorandum by theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries (A.P.1) in which attention is drawn to the serious financial situation whioh, in consequenceof the heavy fall in the world price of cereals, will ariseat the end of the present financial year, and in future years, in respect of prices for wheat and oats guaranteed underthe provisions of the Agriculture Act 1920.SNT OF        The Committee are advised that assuming that there is I HNAN-I COM- no further fall in market prices, the Government would have to fcilT.pay for the coming crop a subsidy of about  10,000,000 in respect of oats and  400,000 in respect of wheat.   A fall of l/- a quarter on the acreage of last year involves in the case of oats an increase in the guarantee of  825,000 and In the case of wheat  380,000.      Consequently if there is a further fall in price, or if the acreage under cultivation is largely increased, the obligation of the Government might amount to a much larger sum, extending to  20,000,000. or even more, in respect both of this year&apos;s crop and future crops.The guaranteed prices are provided by Part I of the Act and continue from year to year.   There is power by Order in Council to give 4 years1 notice to terminate Part I of the Act.      Any earlier termination can only be effected by legislation.(THIS DOOUMEUT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAjfeSTY^S GOTTCRBIENT).
The Committee are unanimous that it is impossible to avoid payment of the guarantee for the coming harvest.   The seed now in the ground has been sown on the strength of the guarantee provided by tho Act and to omit to pay it would bo regarded and rightly regarded by the Agricultural Community as a gross breach of faith on the part of the Government, This payment will fall due in the finanoial year 1922/23.In reepedt of future years, the Committee hatfe explored the following alternatives on the assumption that the Govern-ment are not prepared to faoe the risk of further heavy finanoial liabilltyi-(1) To reverse the policy of the Government by repealing tha Agriculture Aot 1920 -(a) Either Part I (which provides for guaranteed prices, the power to enforce proper cultivation and continues the Agricultural Wages Boardand wages committees);(b) Or the whole Aot (including Part II, which deals with land tenure and provides oompensa-ticn for disturbance.(2)   To remove the guarantee from oats and apply it towheat only,(3) To reduce the standard price of oats upon whioh the guarantee is calculated, on the ground that the standard prioe for cats in Seotion 2 of the Aot stands at too high a figure. This standard prioe was inserted in the Aot at the figure fixed by the Royal Commission in 1919, after hearing evidence on the subject.(4) To negotiate with representatives of the farmers with the view to aalving at an agreement.
(5) To postpone any action for ono year in order to be able more accurately to appreciate the financial position, and to determine whether the object of the Agriculture Act to secure an increase of arable land is in .faot being achieved.The Committee are advised both by the Minister of agri-culture and by the Secretary for Scotland that any proposal either to omit oats or to reduce the standard price for oats upon whioh the guarantee is calculated, would be strongly resisted by the farmers, and is not a practical policy.The Committee are also advised, as tho result oi eon-fidential enquiries which have been made by the Minister of Agriculture and the Secretary for Scotland, that it should not bo very difficult to secure the assent of the farmers to the suspension of guaranteed prices provided that the whole of Part I of the Act is repealed; that is to say, that the power to enforce proper cultivation and the agricultural Wages Boards and Committees would at the same time disappear.In short the only practical alternatives are  (i) To repeal Part I for possibly the whole of the Agriculture Act iljjJ.o), either in agreement with the farmers and other inter-ests concerned, or without such agreement,(ii) To postpone a decision in order to be in a position in a years time, to appreciate the situation more accurately.The majority oi the Committee, consisting of the Chairman,Sir Arthur Boscawen, Mr. Baldwin, Mr. Munro, Dr. Addison, and commander Hilton loung, are in favour of the first alternative.They advise the Cabinet that the present situation Is impossibleand must be terminated; if possible, by agreement with the farmers.
They arc informed by the Minister of Agriculturethat many leading agricultural!ots realize this.The Committee are of opinion that in view of thefinancial situation the Government should not run therisk of having to pay a very large sum. by way of subsidy to Agriculture for the harvest of 1922.   Theyarc forced, with great reluctance, to this conclusion,and they do not attempt to disguise the fact that it involves a reversal of the agricultural policy ofthe Government deliberately agreed to less than twelve months ago.   But the financial conditionswhich have intervened since that date, coupled with theheavy fall in the world price of cereals, mako it,in their opinion, impossible to ask Parliament toprovide sums which may amount to  10 or  20 millions in the Bpring of 1923 and possibly in future years forthe benefit of Agriculture, with the possibility of similar payments in future years.   Moreover, the refusal of the Government to subsidise coal mining ana otherindustries make it, impossible to justify the payment   &apos;every year of so large a sum to Agriculture.Dr. Addison desires it to be recorded that heaccepts the recommendation of the majority of the1Committee on the understanding that negotiations are undertaken &apos;to substitue joint representative District Conciliation Boards for the Wages Committees.   The Committee were informed by the Minister of Agriculture that the farmers representatives were inclined to agree to an arrangement ftf this kind.Lord Lee on the other hand is unable to assent to the recommendation of the majority of the Committee and proposes, that no aotion should be taken to terminate the guaranteed /-   a -
!Qprices until the lapse of one year, and until the actual facts are known Tooth with regard to acreage and price of cereals grown;     By that time the Government would be in a better position to determine the extent of their financial liability in future years, and also to ascertain whether the system of guaranteed prices is in fact securing an increase in the area of cultivation, which was the main object of the Agriculture Act.Major T/ood is -of opinion that the Cabinet should reserve their decision until further enquiries as to the possibility of securing agreement to the repeal of Part I. of the Agriculture Act have been addressed to representatives of the farmers, and also to representatives of the land-owners who have not yet been approached; that tho Minister of Agriculture and the Secretary for Scotland should be authorised to negotiate on that basis, and that a final decision on the matter should be reserved in the meantime.(initialled)   A.
