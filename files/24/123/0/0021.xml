CABINET.

REDUCTION OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURE.

Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

I wish to bring before my colleagues a draft circular to public Departments directing them to examine current expenditure with a view to securing a large reduction in the estimates for 1922/23, and I request that the specific approval of the Cabinet should be given to the terms of this circular.

TREASURY, S.W.

9th May, 1921.
REDUCTION OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURE.

I am directed by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury to refer to the Financial Statement made by the Lord Privy Seal on 25th April when opening the Budget in Committee of Ways and Means of the House of Commons.

After explaining that the estimated Ordinary expenditure on Supply Services for the current financial year 1921-22, exclusive of a provision of £65 millions for special transitory services, amounted to nearly £603 millions, making with the provision for Debt Interest and other Consolidated Fund Services of £371 millions a total Ordinary expenditure of £974 millions, Mr. Chamberlain drew the attention of the Committee to the position which would arise in 1922-23. He stated that, even after allowing for normal increase of revenue, he could not safely anticipate an ordinary revenue of more than £950 millions next year to meet the Ordinary expenditure of that year, and proceeded as follows:-

"We have to provide next year for one considerable item not included in this year&apos;s estimates, namely, interest on our debt to the United States of America which at par of exchange amounts to over £40 millions a year.     It is possible that we may not require to provide more than half the whole year&apos;s interest on our debt to the United States Government in 1922-23. Even so the starting point on the expenditure side on the present basis (excluding Debt Redemption) is not likely to be less than £950 millions. Clearly that is too high and it must be reduced. It is our business to reduce it, if we can, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with the authority of the Cabinet, is setting the Treasury machinery in motion forthwith to obtain from all the Departments preliminary estimates of their expenditure for next year and in co-operation with each Department to prepare the way for drastic reductions in next year&apos;s estimates as compared with those of this year".

?.
Mr. Chamberlain then indicated that a reduction in expenditure which would make the amount available for debt redemption in 1922-23 out of ordinary revenue £100 millions could not be considered to be excessive, even allowing for the fact that in 1922-23 there might be a non-recurring surplus of special revenue over special expenditure.

The following amplifies the above statement.

So far as can be seen at present the Ordinary Revenue of the State in 1922-23, even if no taxation is remitted in that year, is not likely to exceed £950,000,000. Against this sum there must be set in the first place not less than £365,000,000 for Debt (Interest only) and other Consolidated Fund services, and in the second place a substantial sum, not less than £100,000,000 to meet already existing contractual liabilities to holders of particular War Loans some part of the debt maturing for payment in 1922-23. These amounts contain no provision for reducing the Floating Debt (on 31st March, 1921, £1,275,000,000) maturing from day to day, or for a proper sinking fund for War loans generally; but it will be seen that even on the above minimum provision £465,000,000 out of the ordinary revenue of £950,000,000 is accounted for. This leaves a balance of £485,000,000 only for all ordinary Supply Services. The estimate for these services in 1921-22 is £603,000,000 and next year there will be, apart from automatic growth of grants to Local Authorities, additional charges, e.g. under the Agriculture Act, 1920. It is therefore clear that very drastic steps must be taken to reduce expenditure by 1922-23. The only alternatives to reduction of expenditure are -

(a) fresh borrowing which, in addition to increasing the charge for interest, would mean renewed lnflation, with its attendant evils including the depression of the £ sterling at home and abroad.

(b) increased taxation.
It la certain that any increase in taxation *ould seriouslyhamper the recovery of British Industry and cownerce and thus ultimataly Intensify the difficulty of the position and would on that account ho moot vehemently opposed by the House of come.ir.ons ant- by pub lie opinion   in the country;   indeed, what ir required In order to riaintain and jitimulato industry and commerce - and secure full and regular employment in tho county - is a reduction of taxation and of the burden of the State !o indebtedness as rapidly as possibles process which can only bo achieved by a continuous reduction of expenditure throughout tho next few years.His Majestyfs Government have, therefore, cone to the conclusion that it Is necessary to reduce Ordinary Supply Expenditure for 1920-25 to  490,000,000 including all liabilities under the Government of Ireland Act and the Agriculture Act, 1920, and excluding only definite war liquidations such as Shipping and Munitions Liquidation and payments under Railway Agreements.It will be observed that a reduction of Ordinary oxpendituro upon Supply Services to 490 millions involves a reduction cf approximately 20% upon the provision of 603 millions made for the current financial year.    Ao a consider-ablo proportion of ordinary expenditure upon Supply Services is necessitated by unavoidable requirements, the reduction to be effected upon optional expenditure must be appreciably greater than the percentage above mentioned, although the possibility must not bo loft out of account of obtaining Parliamentary sanction for the suspension of certain statutory services.;His Majesty&apos;s Government have accordingly decided that it shall bo an instruction to every Department to undertake forthwith, whether by the appointment of Departmental Commit-tees or by any other procedure which may be thought desirable, a searching examination of their current expenditure With aViO1&quot;/
view to oocurin^ the largo reduction in estimates for 1922-23 which ths eltua;; - * imperatively demands.H M. GOYO ,; &apos;; :*. .tro that ill KftJcittS proposals for reductions v.; d p u-cmonts shall not consider themselves prevented j1&apos;^ proposing the reduction or cessation of a sswiGQ becauca its performance has hitherto been a part of; policy     the Government or because the service is necesni-tated by statute^     It is recognised that a reduction of expen-diture on tho requisite scale may only be obtained by the sacrifice of services in  themselves desirable, and H,M, Government rLM review any questions of policy that may ho rai-sed by eugg* t\c.&amp;. reductions, and, if thoy approve, will obtain any Parliamentary eaactJLon that may be required to carry them out.My Lords request that as soon as such exwdnation has been made, but in any case not later than the 31st July next, Departments vdll furnish t,o them provisional estimates of their probable expenditure in 1922-23,    If suchestimatea cannot conveniently be furnished under tho ordinary Sub-heads of the Voto the expenditure should be classified as far as possible under its main headings.Their lordships officers will be ready to co-operate and to render any assistance, which may be possible in the above-mentioned examination and the preparation of the estimates.Special attention Is drawn to the fact that tho provision for Special Services mentioned in the Budget Speech is for the liquidation of certain war commitments indicated in the Speech and does not include the whole of the provision made in the estimates for &quot;Services arising out of the T?arf1, tho remainder of whioh Is included in Ordinary expenditure.In calculations involving pr:: go cud remuneration, It may be provisionally assumed -oh&amp;t the coat of living index figure will not exceed 100$ above the pre-war figure *hy Lords/
I&apos;y ;,ords earnestly trust that all Departments will co-oporato in effecting the maximum reductions possible in their own expenditure,    A reduction of expenditure upon the requisite scale can only be effected by a common effort, entailing heavy and general sacrifices of services which are in thrusnlv-n desirable,Uuon receipt of the ostimatoa for 1922-25 for your Department they will be examined in this Department and a further comrmnication will be addressed to you, if necessary.It need scarcely be added that it is highly desirable that any ccorrmion which examination chews to be possible 3hould be &quot;..r\v\.;ht into operation, if practicable, at the earliest poo^blo date within the current financial year.
