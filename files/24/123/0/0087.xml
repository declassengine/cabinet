: tDOCIHOTT IS THE PROPERTY op HIS BEIT AMI 0 MAJESTY&apos; 3 GOvT.RjaSSflT).0 RC A B X H 35 T2930oin,:; future supply op cordite.Memorandum by pr. Addison.I have read with interest the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War (CP. 2940) on this subject.   There are, however, certain aspects of this question which are still very fresh in my memory arid which ocoaeioned painful and recurring uncertainties during our early struggles at the Ministry of Munitions and which do not appear to me to be brought out sufficiently in the memoranda hitherto supplied to us 6n this subject,?-Before referring to them, however, let me say that I cannot but hope that Holton Heath which is a splendidly equipped place will be used jointly by the two Services for purposes of Research.   It has the great advantage of enabling researoh to be subjected to the control of manufacturing tests the lack of which with the new propellant designed in the laboratory at Woolwich caused such prolonged embarrassment during the early days of the V/ar.   There&apos; is surely no reason why inter-departmental prejudices should prevent a unity of research effort. *Apart from this, I gather that the Army contemplate a manufacturing capacity of 1,000 tons of cordite per week from the combined sources, but the re-establishment of a cordite factory on the scale of Gretna in addition appears to be still in contemplation.   Is this wise at this stage?Cordite depends upon a&amp;ipply of glycerine.   Thesupply/
-   541supply of glycerine is dependent upon great and bulky imports and these same imports are essential for the manufacture of vital foods, such as m9rgs.r5.noo    In addition to this the supplies of the necessary solvent (acetone) presented diffioul-ties which were almost agonizing at times during the war, Should not our policy be to lock as main aa possible to a pro-pellant explosive aa little dopendent as may be upon imports and one whioh would otherwise interfere to the minimum extent with essential food supplies?The amount of.cordite required for the Navy is trifling by comparison with that needed for the Land Forces and would not proSony material difficulties.    In the case, however, of the vast tonnage required for the Army services, tho matter is very different.     Present knowledge would seem to point to the alternative propellant as &quot;being some form of nitro-cellulose powder, in connection with whioh T understand that it would be possible to dispense even with alcohol as a solvent, This powder during the War formed a large part of our propellant supplies from the United States.     I believe that the excellent nitro-cellulose powder factory at Irvine produces little more than might be required for Small Arms purposes.    Nitro-cellu-loee powder makes substantially less demands on bulk imports, especially on these of food value than does cordite ardl think we cannot exaggerate the importance of planning the development of prcpellant supplies that are less open&apos;to the grave risks tfnich so often imperilled our cordite supplies during the late War,Of the courses recommended in the Memorandum of theSecretary of State for War, No, (3) seems to me to be open tothe least objection, provided that the essential machinery at .-Grstnao
Gretna were suitably stored, so as to avoid the continued cost of the mainxenanoe of so large an establishment-, but I trust that no decision will be arrived at until the Cabinet has been provided with a Report showing what steps are being or can be taken to provide an alternative propel-lant less open to the objections which apply to cordite supplies on a large saaie*(3gd).
