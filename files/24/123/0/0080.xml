Lea/rue of Nations Department of the Chinese Republic.STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR THE CHINESE AmuTMTCT.It may he recalled that the first draft of the Covenant whichthe League of JJations Commission had in February of 1919 adoptedajad.-reported to the Conference on the Preliminaries of peace in Paris made no mention of the Monroe Doctrine.   A speoificprovision mentioning the llonroe Doctrine was subsequently proposed and inserted in the text with a view to allaying the anxietiesthen felt in oertain quarters over its omission.   Objectionshaving been raised on the ground that the provision, in givingrecognition to the policy of a particular State was in form outof harmony with the rest of tne document, it was redrafted, theresult being the present Article 21 of the Covenant, to wit;&quot;Nothing in this Covenant shall be deemed to affect the validity of international engagements, such as treaties of arbitration or regional understandings like the Ifonroe Doctrine, for securing the maintenance of peace.&quot;&apos;In other words, the reference in the present Article to &quot;international engagements&apos;1 and &quot;regional understandings&quot; was added not because of any fundamental neoe3sity to refer to them in the Covenant, hut primarily to secure harmony in form with the other provisions.. This geiieral reference to &quot;international engagements&quot; and&quot;regional understandings&quot;, however, opens the door for suchpossible unwarranted interpretation as to cover all kinds ofunderstandings, regardless of their true nature and purport, andimpairs the force and usefulness of Article 20 of the Covenant,which provides, in part;&quot;The Members of the League severally agree that this Covenant is accepted as abrogating all obligations or understandings inter se   which are inconsistent with the terms thereof.....&quot;There are notably several existing understandings which may come within the scope of Article 21, but which are
fundamentally inconsistent with tho spirit and principles underlying the Covenant, in that they   claim an&apos; mutually recognise spheres of interest or influence of two or several contracting States in tho territories of a third State-.   Too much emphasis cannot be laid on the fact that such understand-ings have frequently been ,arrived at without the consent or knowledge, and in some instances even under the emphatic protest, of the third Pover whose vital interests are involved.   Though ostensibly for the purpose of maintaining peace, their real object, as disclosed in-their practical application, is usually the exploitation of the people and resources of the third State, to the impairment or prejudice of its political independenceiand territorial integrity.   Besides, the existence of such understandings is often a serious cause for misunoerstandings between the parties to them on one hand and the territorial sovereign on the other, while the execution of them invariably generates friction between them and not infrequently leads to an international crisis,, if not to an actual conflict.   The interests of peace are more jeopardised than secured.There appears, moreover, no Imperative reason for giving comprehensive recognition to international engagements and regional understandings in the Covenant, even if they are all intended &quot;for securing the maintenance of peace.&quot;   The validity of an understanding or agreement ou,jht to be judged-, in each instance, on its own merits, with due regard to the spirit and principles of the Covenant.   If an international agreement or understanding is sound in principle and truly conducive to peace, there is nothing in the Covenant that rni::ht invali-date it.   The. elimination of the reference to international agreements or regional understandings in Article 21 would not necessarily have the effect of denying validity to those having the character just mentioned.&apos;&quot;  .
In so far as such international engagements as treaties of arbitration are concerned, the recognition of their validity appears already implied, if not expressly provided for, in Article 13 of the Covenant.   Reiteration of it in Article 21, therefore, does not seem to add any thi n,-; to their value or validity.The specific reference to the Monroe Doctrine is pro-posed because, apart from allaying the anxieties in certain quarters, it serves to give recognition to the fact that the Monroe Loctrine has been tested for a century and been found to hove contributed not inconsiderably to the development of liberty ana peace in a large part of the world.
