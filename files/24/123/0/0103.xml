This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. SECRET.rry,CP, 2996.THE CABINET.internment of irish rebels.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.Urgent representations have been received from the G.O.C.-in-C, the Forces in Ireland, that as there is no further accommodation in Ireland, arrangements should at once be made for the reception of 2,000 Irish internees in. this country. To erect a camp for the purpose in Ireland would take from 6 to 12 months, and would cost approximately 300,000/.The Home Office have been consulted, and although it is understood that Portland Prison is empty, they demur to its use for the internment of Irish rebels on the ground that it is not the duty of that Department to arrange accommodation for interned Sinn Feiners.Although it is true that these internees are treated, e.g., for the purpose of rations and discipline, on the same lines as prisoners of war, it is most important to make it clear that they are not prisoners of war, and General Macready has recently prepared a pamphlet addressed to members of the Irish Republican Army emphasizing this fact, and pointing out that they cannot be regarded as the lawfully organized forces of a recognized government. The pamphlet is now being distributed. The fact that captured members of the Irish Republican Army are treated in certain respects like prisoners of war no more renders them actually prisoners of war than the fact that the military forces in Ireland are declared to be &quot; on active service &quot; makes them &quot; at war.&quot;I feel very strongly that these rebels should be interned by the Civil Power. The only alternative is to provide accommodation (say) at Catterick at considerable expense, which I have not yet been able to estimate, and for which no provision is made in Estimates, and, even apart from the considerations I have explained, it would be in the highest degree uneconomical if, as is understood, Portland Prison is available.L. W.-E.The War Office,SIst May, 1921.(B21/212)   100  6/21   H&amp;S, Ltd.   9244wo&apos;
