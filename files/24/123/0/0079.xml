(miB womws is the propers oe his britannic  irtoty-s sotbrimeht) .CABINET.2KB mCPIOmSNT 0? SEYEEEIY DISABLED HEN.secret  o PuKOTE BY THE MINISTEH Cf LABOUR.I circulate herewith the report, prefaced by a summary, of a Committee which, under the Chairmanship of the parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour, has gone very carefully into the question of the employment of men who are so severely disabled as to be unable to take their plaoes in ordinary industry. The report raises an important question of policy, and in view of the special urgency of the problem, especially as it affects the Lord Roberts Memorial Workshops, whioh can no longer carry on under existing conditions, I ask that it may receive very early consideration,(Sgd)   T,J. MAONMARA.Ministry of Xabour. %5jh lfiay7^Z^T*
iBX OP IKE mSOm OP IHE COMMIWEK APPOIKTKD		^rmmmmmtK				1.   The Oemmittee was appointed by the Minister of Labour on the  End September,1980, and consisted of Representatives of the Ministries of Labour end Pensions, with Sir Montague Barlow. Parliamentary Secretary to the former Ministry, as Chairman,2.  Definition of Problem.The Committee defined the class of men forming their problem as men who, after all possible had been done by way of treatment or combined treatment and training, would never be able to take their places in ordinary industry even with considerate employers. The clar-s, whioh for the purpose of convenience was entitled &quot;01*00 0&quot;, was sub-divided Into oases of severe mutilation, and chronic oases of disease *    Grave and urgent complaints are being8.made by Employment Committees, ex-Service Men&apos;s Associations and similar bodies that something must be done for these n0w men. 3,   Numbers forming Problem.The Committees estimated that the number of ClasB nC men varied between 10,000 and 50,0CG, and after allowing for the proportion who would prefer not to avail themselves of any opportunities afforded under the Committee&apos;s recommendations, they came to the conclusion that the number for whom provision would have to be made would be, at the most 20,000 to  5,000. They were also of   opinion that this maximum could not be reaohed for some considerable time.4.4.   Iivldence.Large numbers of witnesses were examined, including Representatives of all voluntary organisations which had had experience of the Class.   Most of these Institutions declared that
if they were to extend their work, finanoial assistance from pTibXio Siniroes was absolutely neoessary.   Quite recently Lord Roberts Memorial Workshops whioh provide employment for some hundreds of &quot;0&quot; men have decided they cannot carry on without some State help. 5. Solutions Suggested to the Committee .Among the suggestions put forward by witnesses, was one for an increase in the pensions provisions, but the Committee were of the opinion that this problem was primarily one of employment and not of pension,  further being a problem of employment it must be dealt with locally.   They also gaveoareful consideration to proposals for the establishment of State Workshops, &amp;ut after examining the methods of existing Voluntary Institutions, they decided in favour of an extension of the latter method,  This conclusion has the support of the Ex-Service Men1s Associations, 6, Heoommendatlons.(1) That in eaoh County and Borough, the Chairman of the County Oounoil ani the Mayor should be invited to hold public meetings for the purpose of stating the case for the Glass &quot;C&quot; men, and to form a General Otmmittee to go into the matter, substantial representation on such a Committee to be given to Looal Employment and War Pensions Committees, and above all Ex-Service Men!s Organisations.(2) That the General Committee should set up a strongClassification Sub-Committee, to ascertain how many Class rtCn men existed within the area,   She inter-departmental -  Oommittee were of the opinion that any tendency toclassify unduly large numbers as WC&quot; men would be checked if the Central Authority indicated broadly the kind of /   case to be included, and the State grant were ms.de conditional upon the raising of all the rest of the funds locally..&quot;(&amp;) That the Local Oommittee should then take steps to provide institutional facilities.   These would normally take;the -form of local Workshops on the lines of lord Boberts Memorial Workshops, and in areas where voluntary institutions of this type already exist, endeavour should be made to arrange for their adoption by the locality. In gome oases it might be practicable to provide suitable cases with home work./(*)
(4) That the initial expenses and any running losses incurred, / should bo home by the locality, with limited assistance le Report     from the State, the latter to take the following form.-Ia.16,(a) Disposal or assistance in the disposal of the product of the Institutions through the Government9 Report     Contracting Departments, Army,Navy,etc. a.15 (ii)(b) Payment of a per capita grant of not more that  25 per annum,   (This cum was reached after careful analysis of the losses incurred in running existing voluntaryje Report     institutions, and represents only a proportion thereof). jft.16, $&amp;t loss on Lord Roberts Workshops is said to be  100per annum per man,(5) That the wages paid to the men should bear some reasonable relation to the eoonomio value of the work done, a minimum wage- on a reasonably generous basis being fixed, (Evidenoe showed that opposition to this method would probably not be enoountered from Trade Unionists provided that wages were assessed by bodies including) Report     Representatives of the disabled men themselves, - and .15 (i)       the products were kept off the market as proposed in 4 (a) above),(6) That, generally speaking, control and management should Report     be rested in the Local Oommittee, .16.(7) Special provisions were proposed for agricultural Report     and sparsely populated areas and also for large and , 17,        poor Industrial Centres,   (The Committee hoped that Report.    In any ease London will be recognised as a Unit), ,18,
