SECRET.CP. 2990.THE CABINET.re-equipment of the indian army from surplus stores.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.Mr. Montagu&apos;s Note, circulated on 22nd April, asking for special concessions in the prices of stores for the re-equipment of the Indian Army (CP. 2879), is apparently written in response to an invitation conveyed in the War Office letter of August, 1920, 1o which he refers. That letter offered new stores at 50 per cent, of thelVocabulary price, as being, from a business point of view, a fair compromise between buyer and seller in this case, and suggested that any proposal for deferred payment or for policy concessions in the matter of prices should be made to the Treasury and the Cabinet. The original communication from the Indian Government in March, 1920, had included a proposal that India should pay by annual instalments up to the amount that her resources would permit, but no mention of this possibility is made in Mr. Montagu&apos;s Note.It did not appear to the War Office and Disposals Board that the question of handing over finally to the Indian Government, at scrap value, large accumulations of stores of all kinds, as to the existence of which, the War Office had till recently little or no knowledge, could prudently be entirely dissociated from the question of the still unadjusted claim of India for payment of the full value of the same stores; and further consideration of the position has seemed to indicate that in declaring these stores surplus, no systematic provision had been made for the future requirements of Indian troops in Mesopotamia, &amp;c, chargeable to the War Office, so that there appeared to be some possibility that the British Government, having paid the full original cost and resold to India at scrap value, might be a second time charged full price for the stores when issued to Indian units.   Official communications are proceeding on this point.This question of special financial concessions in the shape of prices or of deferred payment, or both, is one of a number of financial questions between the two Governments arising out of the war, all of which appear likely to give rise to protracted discussions and difficulties in settlement. Among other such questions are the incidence of charges for the Meshed Force ; India&apos;s &quot; further &quot; contribution to the cost of the war and the division of war pension charges (Mr. Baldwins Committee); the charges for demobilization benefits of Indian troops (Paper F.C. 63, as to which I am in communi-cation with Mr. Montagu), &amp;c. In all these matters there appears to be some tendency to press the claims of India on the British Government to the utmost, while claims against India are met with appeals either to the protection given to Indian revenues by the Government of India Act, or to pure policy as in the present case. I am compelled to ask whether the British taxpayer of to-day can afford to leave business considerations entirely out of the settlement of such questions.It seems to me desirable that these and all other claims and counter-claims arising out of the war should now be brought into a general settlement, in which a comprehensive view may be taken of the financial position of both parties, and the raising hereafter of claims on either side may be finally barred. I have suggested to Mr. Montagu that such a settlement might be entrusted to the Minister without Portfolio.If this is agreed to, 1 would suggest that India should now decide what stores she wishes to retain, on the understanding that any concession of terms lower than those offered by the War Office in August last should form part of the general settlement. It will be necessary to frame a rough estimate of the value of the stores in question. I have not been able to discover from papers in the War Office how many millions are involved.L. W.-E.The War Office,May, 4921.(B21/206)  100  5/21  H&amp;S, Ltd.  9237\vo
