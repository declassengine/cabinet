(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE paOEMT OP HIS BHITAMHIO MAJ&amp;W S GOVBRNIvIEiJT).(ISEC li 3 T.Copy No.CP,-2959.0 A B I 11 IS IBATTLEFIELD MSI\0RIALSMemorandum by the Hrat Commissioner of Works.In reference to the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War C,P* 2927 (11th May) as to procedure for erecting these Memorials, I submit a note of caution.     The Vote being in Class I., I am&apos;responsible to Parliament, but my Department, as such, has no control except that the Secretary is one of sixteen members of Lord MidletonTsWe should proceed with circumspection.     The Cenotaph ia endeared to the British public for intimate and personal reasons we all appreciate.   It possesses a continuing vitality, and is in effect a centre of pilgrimage and emotion.     It will make no such appeal to the Parisians, who dislike replicas, and will misunder-stand its purport, question its artistic lines, and raise difficulties about allotting a prominent site*    Paris is even now angrily attaching schemes for putting /up any icind of new monument in conspicuous places.     I suggest that any request to the Prench Ocvernment should be quite tentative - conversational in fact - and so framed that refusal will be made easy for either party.Committee.(1)   proposed Replica of the Cenotaph to beplaced      a cor^picuqus site ij^JParia.
(2) Monument at La Porto.I Gin glad that tho original recommenda-tfion to throw open the design to public competition is abandoned.    Buoy and successful men seldom submit to the worries and delays involved, but it must be clearly understood that this decision will almost inevitably exclude Dominion Artists or untried men at home*(3)        Subordinate French Memorials -Commemorative  ablets suggested for fifteen French Cathedrals.Discretion, both as to design and our relations with tho Church Authorities, is specially needed,   though email in scale these t ablets will offer a real chance to British sculptors.    I regret, by the way, that there is no proposal to erect any memorial in Italy or Egypt.    Perhaps the number of these French memorials could be reduced accordingly..(4)      . Brussels^A memorial is to be erected at the Instance of the War Office, who are to be consulted as to its character.    The Foreign Office has consented to defend the proposal in Parliament, and the money is charged to Class I.    I cm inclined to deprecate Joint responsibility, especially when dealing with a foreign Government, end the  to departments concerned the less embarrassment to tho artist and the more probable his success.    This seems a case where public oojnpe-tition would be inappreiat &amp;
(5)        Y*ores *Australia refuses to subscribe to tho Aroliway to bo erected as the Central Memorial of British gallantry *    Other Dominions ma^ act like-wise    I Gather that Sir Reginald Blomfield, R.Ai, was consulsoioncd to rslze a design which has now been discarded, raid that ho has entered a substantial claim for services rendered.    As this will fall on my Votes I. invite protection from this kind of embarrac sment eMeanwhile, the Royal Institute of British Architects has refused to appoint an assessor if (as suggested by Lord Midleton!s Committee) the Chief Architect of tho Office of Works is also an asseesor*    Sir Alfred.Mond never suggested that the official in question should act &amp;s assessor:   neither do 1*    But I must ask permission to insist that, as public money is to be spent, my Department shall be kept fully informed, so that due supervision and control may be exercised throughout.(6) Galli&amp;oU*.Sites are being examined by represent tatives of the Army and Navy, without a final decision as to cost, or whether the memorial shall be Architectural, plastic, or both,(7)        Finance 1921/2 and onwards.Parliament has not yet passed the Estimate for &quot;War Memorials, end is unlikely to do so before August,    The outlay during tho present financialyear/
year will bo small, perhaps  20,.000, and no far as the Yprea Monument is concernedf will be small in 1922/3*   I doubt if that Memorial can be finished much before the early summer of 1924*   The total estimate for all memorials is  205,000.(8)   . general Considerations ftWe are faced by many and prolonged difficultiesj some technical, others arising from problems of sentiment or professional etiquette.-   Moreover, I foresee a danger that artistic aspects may be submerged by historic, political and diplomatic considerations.   In the long run the artistic side will alone carry failure or success *   At present, with huge Committees and half a dozen Departments concerned, responsibility is too scattered, too much i nt er d ep artment al1s ed 0I do not suggest that the existing Committee should be changed, though its obvious need is a well qualified Selection Subcommittee.   I do, however, press that, with the large issues Involved, it should not have rare and occasional meetings but should be asked to meet at short and regular intervals, securing that &amp;ts members shall be authorised to act, subject to financial control by my Department and the ultimate sanction of the Cabineto(Intd) 0* &amp; 3*    .2, Whitehall Gardens, Sr!7, May 23rd. 1921,
