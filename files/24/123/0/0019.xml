(T.HS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MJSSTY?S GOVERNMENT) SECRET.&apos; CABINET.C.P. 2917.THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE i&apos;UND.Note by Mr, Chamberlain on the memorandum of the _Minister of Labour CP.2910._The warning&apos; uttered by the Minister of Labour will scarcely come as a surprise to the Cabinet, but the fact that it was to be expected does not render it less Grave.The proposals whioh the Minister will formulate will of course be discussed, as he proposes, with the Chancellor of the Exchequer before being submitted to the Cabinet, and I will not anticipate that discuss5on.   But there is one sentence In the Ministers memorandum on which I must comment.The Minister writes:-&quot;In the detailed discussions that were held upon the framing of the Act between the Treasury and the Ministry of Labour, it was agreed that the scheme would be financially sound up to July 1922, provided that the average number of unemployed persons drawing benefit throughout the whole emergency period of 16 months did not exceed 1,000,000 workers a week.   It was always made clear to the Treasury that if throughout this emergency period, the hopes of an industrial revival were falsified and the average number of unemployed persons drawing benefit was in fact greater than the number upon which the finance of the soheme was based, the Act would either have to be remodelled, or direct financial assistance given to the J?und.&quot;ThIs.&apos;..
This is true, but it is only part of the truth and it is therefore, no doubt unintentionally, unfair both to the Treasury and myself.   It is true that the Minister warned us that if the rate of unemployment on which his calculations was based were exceeded, the calculations themselves would be falsified - a proposition which was indeed sufficiently . obviouB not to have escaped the notice of the Treasury.   But the Minister forgets to say that he repeatedly assured the then Chancellor and the Cabinet that he had put the rate of unemployment extravagantly high and that he thus retained alarge secret margin for contingencies; that he ridiculed the doubts of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and pressed continu-ously for more generous terms than the Chancellor was willing4 v.1to grant; that he accepted with reluctance the Cabinet&apos;decision in favour of the Chancellor, and under pressure fromf- - -..the House subsequently eitorted&apos; a reluctant assent from the Chancellor to the increase of benefits to the higher figures which the1 Minister had throughout favoured, again assuring, us that it was impossible to suppose that unemployment could reach the figure for which allowance had Deen made.   In short the&apos; &apos; &quot;warning to the Treasury&quot; was perfunctory and without conviction. The optimistic assurances were confident, emphatic and repeated.These things&apos; too&apos;are a warning - for all of us. : :(Intd,) A.C..11, I)owning: S tre et, S.W.. 7th May, .1921..   .
