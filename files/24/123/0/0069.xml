SUITARY OP THE R2P0RT OP TH7- IgAGgg OP HATIOH3cePnssioi?.(Prepared in the Cabinet, Secretariat).The Commission of Rapporteurs have now furnished the Secretariat of the League with their Report on the Aaland Islands question.The Report is a lengthy document running, with its annexes, to over 50 pages of foolscap print, and treats the whole question exhaustively and in the most painstaking fashion from every point of view.The Rapporteurs arrive at the conclusion that the right of sovereignty of Finland over these islands is incontestable, and that their present legal status is that they form part of  inland.After examining the question of the &quot;right of self-determination&quot; they come to the conclusion that there is no case for applying suoh a doctrine to the Aaland Islands.&quot;The separation of a minority from the State of which &quot;it forms a part and its incorporation in another State &quot;can only be considered as an altogether exceptional solu-&quot;tion, a last resort when the State laci-cs either the will &quot;or the power to enact and apply just and effective &quot;guarantees.&quot;&quot;The Finnish State is ready to grant the inhabitants&quot;satisfactory guarantees........: of this we have no d^doubt.&quot;To take the Aaland Islands away from Finland in these &quot;circumstances would be the more unjust inasmuch as. from the &quot;point of view of history, geography and politics all the &quot;arguments militate in favour of the status quo.&quot;After rejecting the idea (l) of giving complete inde-pendence to the Islands, (S) of leaving things as theyare and holding a nlehescite after a certain number of- 1 -
years, the Commission make oertain recommendations as to the granting by Finland of oertain essential guarantees for tho Aalanders to complete the law of autonomy voted by the Finnish Diet in May 1920.To prevent any attempt to check the use of Swedish as a language the Commission propose (1)   that in Aaland the primary schools, and even the technioal school, should only glvo instruction in-Swedish to the obligatory ex-conclusion of Finnish, (2)   in order to preserve for tho communes and, inhabitants of Aaland the exclusive owner-ship of their property, the right of pre-emption should be given them whenever offers of purchase are made by a non-Aaland person or company, (3) that when a new Governor has to be&apos; appointed the Grand Counoil of the Aaland Islands should have the right ,of presenting a list of three candidates to the Finnish Government, who should not go outside this list in making their appointment.After addressing counsels of moderation to the Aalanders the Commission go on to say that should the Finns, contrary to what they have been given to understand, refuse to give to the Aalanders the guarantees specified above, there would be another possible solution - precisely the one which they desire to eliminate - namely to advise the separation of the Islands from Finland, based on the wishes of the inhabitants, whioh would be expressed by a plebiscite.If the Couiioil share the views of the Commission and recommend their adoption to the Finnish Government, oertain amendments to the law of autonomy would be suffi-cient to give a legal force to the&quot;now guarantees granted
to the Aalanders.Should further&quot;difficulties arise in the future in connection with these guarantees, it would be the duty of the Council to intervene and try in tho first instance to settle the difference as an impartial mediators   if this did not succeeds reoouxsd might he had to the Permanent Court,Neutralisation of the Islands.* -The Commission note that the Jurists4 Report has amply proved that the stipulations of the Convention of Paris (1856) are still in force and that they have created a special international status for the Aaland Islands. The Commission consider that some wider form of inter-national guarantee should be given to the neutralisation of the Islands and have ascertained that &quot;both Sweden and Finland would agree to a Convention in which, in addition to themselves, Denmark9 France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy and Poland would participate, a place being reserved for Russia to adhere to it eventually.     This Convention should be made under the auspices of the League, who should be given the .task of ensuring its execution^tr .................n --2 Whitehall Gardens, S.Wol. 24th lay, 1921.
