(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.)CABINET.Draft Convention of tho Washington International Labour Conforcnco on tho Regulation of Hours of Labour.MEMORANDUM  BY  THE   MINISTER OP M30UR.It is becoming a matter of urgent ncoessity that the British Government should define ita attitude to the 48 Hours Convention adopted at the First General Conference of the International labour Organisation &apos;held at Washington.Under Article 405 of the Treaty of Versailles each Member of the International Labour Organisation must, vifithin a maximum period of 18 months from the olosilng of the session of the Conferenoe (in this ease July 27th next), bring the Convention before tho Authority or Authorities within Whose competence the matter lies for the enactment of legislation or other aotion.Certain members of the Houso, notably Mr. G.N. Barnes, tho chief Government delegate at tho Conference, hold the view that under the abovo cited Article the House of Conmons must have an opportunity of deoiding what aotion shall be taken to givo effect to tho Convention.   This view is likely to bo raised when tho discussion on tho Government*s attitude to the Washington Conventions takes place on the 27th May.   On the other hand, it is held that the question of giving effect to this Convention is a matter primarily for the Executive, and that tho Executive can accordingly decide not to bring tho matter before the Houso if it so desires.
III. Unloca before the  ?th July authorised specificaction one way or another under Article 405 is taken, the British Government will be in default and tho British member of the International Labour Organisation will be exposed to penalties under Artiole 416 et seq. of the Treaty, that ia, any other member may refer the matter to the Permanent Court of International Justice whoso decision Ib final, and who shall undertake the measures, if any, of an economic ohiraoter whioh it considers to be appropriate, and whioh other Governments will be justifiod in adopting against tho defaulting Government. IV. Apart from the constitutional question as to themethod by whioh a decision Is.to be sought in the matter, &quot;the position of the Government vis-a-vis the International Labour Organisation aa a whole, and the merits of the specific Convention proposed, require to be considered. If the Government does not give effect to the Convention it would be exposed to very strong criticism from the supporters of the League of nations.   The Convention was drawn up by a Commission which included representatives of the Government and of British employers and workpeople.   It is the most important Convention which has been adopted at the Internationa] Labour Organisation General Conferences.   If we refuse to ratify the Convention ether oountriea will undoubtedly follow our example, t.g, France may decide to abandon her Eight Hours Act, the ohief pieoe of work of the International Organisation will be made ineffective, and the default of Great Britain would be a blow to the Organisation of a very serious nature. It would be unfortunate if we were Baddled with the respon-sibility for this state of affairs, since,, in substance, we . are carrying out the main principles of the Convention (apart from.the statutory lim*. tat ion of overtime) at the present time by industrial agreements, and. have done so/independently-    -
independently of, and prior to, the Convention.   Further, oritieisra would be received from labour representatives on the ground that we were depriving workers of a statutory right whioh has such atrong international support.On the other hand, I feel it is my duty to call attention to several grave difficulties jLn connection with the Convention and any legislation which could be proposed for this country to give effect to it.    In the first place, the Convention included railway undertakings.   The railway trade unions and the railway oompanies are agreed that the limitations proposed by the Convention are not applicable to the British railway system, and the Minister of Transport agrees.   At present the railwaymen are governed by agreements under which there is a &quot;guaranteed week&quot; of 48 hours apart from Sunday, and it appears that the adoption of the Convention would make it necessary to interfere with these agreements. In view of the imminence of decontrol it is inadvisable to propose this Interference now.    In the circumstances, it would not in any event be possible for us to give strict effect to the Convention as a whole,   furthermore the Convention contemplates a statutory limitation of, and departmental interference with, the hours of overtime worked in the various industries,   ffihere is a strong tendency to reduce overtime throughout all industries, but the limitation of overtime can be more easily carried out by industrial agreements applicable to the various trades than by the somewhat inelastic method of departmental regulation.In addition, any legislation which had to be introduced to give effect to the Convention would have to pay regard to the long negotiations which have been oarried out between the Government and the
Provisional Joint,Committee of tho National Industrial Conference in this country on the same question.    The re-commendations of the Provisional Joint Committee go further than the Washington Convention, in that they apply the limitation of hours of employment to all employed persona and not only to persons employed in industrial undertakings. The Government is already committed to give effect to tho main outlines of these reoommendations and if legislation were Introduced at all, I feel that it would be necessary to base that legislation on the wider reoommendations of our Provisional Joint Committee.    Agreement on tho exact nature of the legislation has not boon roaohed with the Provisional Joint Committee, who took exoeption to the proposed exclusion of seamen from the Bill, to the Clauses dealing with agrioul-ture, and to certain other ohanges which have been made from their recommendations.There would of course, be advantages in introduoing into the House a draft of legislation which purports to give effect to the Convention and to the main reoommendations of our Provisional Joint Committee because it is desirable, in the more sober mood in whioh industry now finds itself, that opportunity should be given for full public discussion of the various proposals for the limitation and regulation of the hours of work.    The discussions with the Provisional Joint Committee have been regarded as confidential and all the important industries are not, as a matter of fact, represented on the Committee.
When the industrial aonferenoe mot in 1919 a promise was given by the prime Minister that the reoommendatianfl of the Joint committee would be aoooptod and an intimation wee given that a Bill was being drafted to give effect to the recommendation as to Hours of Labour,   In these circumstances a deoieion niw not to proceed with an Hours Bill is bouad to meet with or it idem,in the ether hand, it wculd be difficult to introduce legielation without an intention of proceeding further with iti especially in a matter of this kind.    Limitation of hours of work by regulation, with perhaps consequential etatutory lnterferetooe in the wages paid for hours over a eartain number* can beet be determined when industrial conditions are normal,   I am not sure that the present opportunity is suitable for the discussUn of suoh a question cwlng to the pressure that would be exeroised by some parties for complete freedom te return to the pre-war hours, and by others for a drastic limitation of the hours of labour* en the theory that only by suoh moans oan the masses of unemployed be absorbed into industry.       Although the British Gdvernment has a heavy responsibility towards the International Labour Organisation/it has, I think, a stronger responsibility not to accept any Convention to which it is not prepared to give honest support, and not to introduoe legislation which would tie  detrimental to our own interests.
II, In these circumstances, I must suggest, albeit withgreat reluctance, that the Government should declare (a) that in the existing state of industry they do not feel that they are able to give effect to the Convention signed at Washington;   (b) that In certain respects the detailed provisions of that Convention would not be appropriate under any circumstances to conditions in this Country;   but (c) that, having regard to the fact that in most industries in this country there is already by agreement between employers and employed, a week of 48 hours or less, they would be prepared, when the opportunities of framing industrial legislation are improved by a return to normal conditions, to co-operate with the other nations who are parties to the International labour Organisation, in preparing another Convention on the same street which can be applied to the benefit of all parties interested,X, The debate which is to take place on Friday 37thinst,,, on the Washington Convention will afford an opportunity of announcing tho decision of the Government on this matter.(Sgd)   0?-&quot; JT.
