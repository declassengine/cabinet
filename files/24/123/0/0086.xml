HE CO/li. MINERSThe orderly conduct of the miners, which has been so marked a feature of the stoppage, has been maintained during the week:   the working; of outcrops has given rise to friction in several distriots and in South Wales there has been &quot;peaceful persuasion&quot; of master hauliers to withdraw from safety work.&quot;Unofficial&quot; proposals for a settlement have been considered by Frank Hodges and Herbert Omith and some of the steadier leaders have abandoned their uncompromising attitude in regard to the National Pool.    Although resolutions in support of the full demands are still being passed by mass meetings there are indications that the end of the stoppage is not far off,   A significant development is the resumption of work by about 600 miners at the Komberton Pits, Shropshire, an example which may be followed in other districts.5?ho miners, as a whole, show weariness of the struggle and distress is increasing:   their ability to hold, out is largely dependent upon the credit they oan obtain; officials of the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association have, for instance, announced that there will be no further issue of strike pay or vouchers, but the local tradesmen are prepared to give ciedit to a large number of miners who are regular customers.   During the stoppage the Investment Committee of the iuaalgamated Engineering Union has lent the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association  50,000 free of interest for the first six months.Action is being taken in Pontypridd against several miners on charges of intimidation and unlawful assembly and certain Maerdy strikers have been committed to the Assises on bail in their own recognisances of  30 in each case.The/
The effect of recent prosecutions and raids is becoming increasingly evident: organisation has been partially dislocated and there are signs of extreme nervousness among: professional agitators.   Speeches are much milder and the audiences have, in some cases, decreased! by two-thirds.   Efforts are, however, being made to set up an underground organisation and this fact, together with the growing custom of speaking under assumed names, will make it difficult to trace leaders of the movement in the future. here is no doubt that if the supply of money from abroad could be stopped communist activity in this country would, for all practical purposes, cease to exist.   Hie membership of the following branches indicates that if headquarters were dependent upon ordinary subscriptions they could scarcely carry on;   Nottingham 20, Derby 18, Birmingham 84 and Coventry 130.   5?he average membership of other branches in the Midlands is 12.The following is an extract from a secret letter sent   i by MacManus to members of the Executive on May 23rd:&quot;He/QJhe embargo placed on coal lias proved to be ^inconvenient rather than effective:   in Glasgow the unloading of coal and food is being carried on successfully . by over 2,000 volunteer workers and most of the railv&amp;railwaymen are handling the coal so discharged vtithout incident. About sixty railraymen have been suspended.   On May 25th a mess meeting of dockers decided to resume work, on the conditions of complete reinstatement and the removal of non-union labour: work may be resumed on Monday next.TH2 COMMUNISTS
3 -&quot;Re the agitational aide.   Full attention is now being paid to thisT   iii rang ement 3 are in hend for the ciroularisation of all Trade Unions, Labour, Socialist and Communist branches and groups throughout the country calling upon them to join in a national agitation of protest against the persecution of the party and demanding the release of its members in prison.&quot;A general policy is being- developed which will operate both locally and nationally and if given attention should secure the desired results.   On the whole the party has so far resumed its normal work as far as one is entitled to expect,    he conduct of the Party generally was commendable indeed and only a few isolated individuals here and there lost all sense of operation or seemed to be deprived of their sense of imagination.   Such exceptions as these -are inevitable and constitute more of an irritating annoyance than of actual danger.&quot;Arrangements are in hand for the issuing to the branches of a complete Constitutional Rules as adopted at the Manchester conference and I intend exhorting them in a covering letter to immediately get them put into operation.   The E.C. members are asked as far as possible to give their assistance in the work of re-organising the branches under the terms of tho Constitutional Rules and expediting the establishment of the Divisional Councils as also prescribed for the conference.   This will then clear the air for the appointment of a Constitution;   Executive Committee on the new basis and at the same time will provide the definite machinery into existence.&quot;Regarding the next meeting of the E.C. I will arrange to have one summoned as soon as it is possible. Our general financial situation is somewhat strained but I am hoping to have overcome it within the next few days.   Meantime each member will help things considerably if they devote themselves to the work of restoring completely the general confidence of the Party,&quot;Branches have been informed by headquarters that owing to the recent raid all correspondence relating to the supply of literature has been seised and are asked to pay up all money due.   The result of this appeal is illuminating, in so far as the Midlands are concerned: not a single branch has responded nor has a penny been paid for the literature received prior to the raid.Arthur MacManus has issued a circular in wh^ch he informs all members that &quot;the aim of the Government is todismantle/
dismantle the Party machinery and cause confusion in our ranks&quot;, and urges them to oo-operate with any sections who are prepared to form &quot;committees for the defence of civil liberties.&quot;Divisional conferences of the Communist &quot;\arty will be held at the beginning of next month.   The London and Rome Counties conference will take place at the International Socialist Club on June 5th:   officials and the committee will be nominated and will be voted upon at the Second Divisional Conference on July 3rd.   The first conference will consider the report of the existing London organisation committee.   One of the London branches of the Communist Party calls itself the University Socialist Club, as it is thought that by so doing there is less chance of attention from the police.William Leslie, of the Workers&apos; International Industrial Union, claims to have received within the last three weeks a letter from  inovieff, in which the latter tolls him that the Soviet Government has decided to stop all contributions to revolutionaries in Great.Britain becaus the leaders of the movement had misrepresented to Lenin the progress of communism in this country.   Antagonism existing between the Communist Party of-Great Britain and Leslie somewhat discounts the value of this statement. A partial examination of the accounts-seized in the raid on the Headquarters of the Communist Party shove that expenditure far exceeding the amount realised from subscriptions has been disbursed.   Peet, who has taken Inkpin&apos;s place since his arrest, is reported to go every Monday morning to some place, unknov,n in the Communist Offi and bring back with him  500 in  1 notes.   This is being carefully enquired into.Walton Newbold, who is probably the most able leader othe/
the Communist Party, has been touring the South Walescoalfield:   his activities have considerably strengthened themovement in this area;   as a result of his visit toYstradgynlais, for instance, a branch of the party withseventy members, has been formed.On L!ay   21st the five communist branches of the BhonddaValley held a joint meeting at Porth, which was attended byA,E. Cook, the divisional secretary,and  passed thefoliowing resolution:&quot;That this meeting of Thondda Communist Branches&apos; calls upon the &apos;Executive Committee&apos; of the &apos;Communist Party&apos;, to seriously consider the action of 1 Comrade Leckie1 in going on hunger strike, during his imprisonment, and inasmuch as &apos;Comrade Leckie&apos; is under the discipline of the &apos;Communist Party&apos;, that we call upon him to immediately break his fast.&quot;The same branches have forwarded to MacKanus a request that he will circularise all.branches of the party, &quot;where there are   miners&quot; asking them to pass lodge resolutions demanding &quot;the calling off of any negotiations, while this persecution (of communists) lasts ttHeadquarters have refused, in spite of repeated appeals, to provide money for the Coventry branch, against which an action has been brought for repossession of the Independent Labour Party Rooms, which have been seised. The breach has been told that it must raise the necessary money as no assistance will be forthcoming from London, owing to the raid on headquarters.   The expenses already incurred amount to  20.There is some dissension in the Leicester branch of the Communist Party as one of the members took round a collection box at a recent Sunday meeting before the collection was announced and spent the money so obtained. Another member is to be expelled because he has not attended recent meetings:   his excuse is that he is &quot;courting&quot; and that Thursday is the only.evening on whichhe/
UNSOTCYMSNTUnemployment continues to increase, largely as aresult!he can meet his fiancee.&apos; Sylvia Pankhurst is to have an &quot;official&quot; welcome a the International Socialist Club on her release, and a special edition of the &quot;Workers1 Dreadnought&quot; will be issued to celebrate the occasion.The National labour Press only printed 11,500 copie of the &quot;Communist&quot; for May 21st and the last page, on which was to have appeared an article entitled &quot;With the Flag&quot; was practically blank, bearing the inscription &quot;at time of going to Press this article was cut out by the Printer.&quot;   In consequence of the &quot;refusal of the. National labour Press to print the full issue&quot; the Communist Part; took a whole page of the &quot;Herald&quot; on May 21st at advertisement rates:   it i3 believed that the cost is  My correspondent reports that in Leicester where la numbers of the &quot;Communist&quot; have hitherto been sold, the I agents have cut down their order very considerably and so had many copies over last week.On June 3rd the Third Congress of the Third Commtm International will commence at Moscow.   The following ifj the agenda:i(l)   Report of the Executive(2)   The world economic crisis and the new tasks oj the Communist International.(3)   Tactics of the International during the revolution.(4)   Transition period - partial actions and the final revolutionary struggle.(5)   Campaign against the Yellow Trade Union International.(6)   The Red Trade Union International and the Communist International.
result of the miners1 stoppage and on May 13th the total number of unemployed,including; men, women, boys and girls, was 1,692,118 and short time workers numbered 1,132,870.The efforts of the communists to obtain control of the unemployed hare not met with the success for which they hoped, but the liaison in some districts is fairly close.   The officials of the committees of &quot;unemployables&quot;, who work from the International Socialist Club, have divided the country into the following areas:&quot;SouthLondon to be the centre, including Gravesend, Bristol, Margate, Plymouth, Exeter, Southampton.NorthIv&amp;nchester to be the centre, including York. Hull Westmorland, Durham, Cumberland, Northumberland, Southport (Lanes.)EastNorwich to be the centre, including Norfolk, Cambridge, Suffolk, Essex, Bedford, Lincoln, Lutoh.V/estGloucester to be the centre, including Worcester, Cheshire, Shropshire, Hereford, Honmouth.CentreBirmingham to be the centre, including Stafford, Leicester, Derby, Nottingham, Northampton, Coventry, and Smethwick. ^The following officials control these areas:North - Crossley (Manchester) South - Hannington (London) East - Dove (Lincoln) West - Holt (pro tern London) Central   - Wakefield (Smethwick)&quot;It is reported that the London &quot;unemployables&quot;contemplate a march to Brighton, in the course of whichthey/
**     Q     Mthoy will -hold.- mo eatings - and^make- colloo tions   or the-, purchasll of food.   They think that if refused food in rural districts they will he able to confiscate it.   Only &quot;class conscious men who will stop at nothing&quot; will be asked to take part and they will be instructed to inform their Labour Exchanges that they are goins into the country to look for work, in order that &quot;Vacant Cards15 for use en route may be supplied to them.The police are being informed.MILITARY ubbt33t in ee321On May 21st friction arose between the Inniskilling Fusiliers and members of the Defence Force in Purfleet Camp, and on the following day riots occurred at Aveley, Over 100 men took possession of the village and attacked the Old Ship Inn.   Many of the men were drunk and considerable damage was done.teb: national union op ex-service menOn May 22nd a meeting of the National Union of Six-Service Men was held in Trafalgar Square:   not more than 300 persons were present, and very little interest was] taken in the proceedings.   Speeches were made by Llewellyn, Martin, Allan Clarke, A.H. Miller, and a. Verness, all of whom appear to have served in the forces.   Martin urged those of his audience v;ho had been in the Army &quot;never again to don khaki or any other uniform for a country which was so ungrateful for services rendered.&quot;EXTREMIST &quot;MOBILIZATION&quot; OHDERIt will be remembered that one of the reasons for the expulsion of Robert Williams from the Communist Party was his failure to lay before the Executive of theTriple/kEi
this     y     mmTriple Alliance a scheme which had been drawn up by certainlabour and co-operative extremists and which it had been intended to put into operation if a strike of the triple alliance materialised.The following i3 believed to be an authentic version ofthe scheme in question:   it was issued from the central office of the National Union of Distributive and AlliedWorkers, of which Bllen &quot;&quot;ilkinson, a member of the british bureau of the Red Trade Union International,&quot;is an official:ilA scheme has -,been drafted for securing the food supplies of the Co-operative movement for the use o  the people involved in the event of a cessation of work by members of the Triple Alliance.&quot;It is already in the hands of, the, Executive Council of that body.&quot;In the event of a Triple Alliance Strike, the Question of feeding the strikers and their families is of first importance.   The following is a draft scheme .for doing this through the joint machinery of the Triple Alliance and the Co-operative movement.   The machinery should be two-fold:.(a) A National Strike Food Committee composedof four representatives from each of the parties to the Triple Alliance,&apos;and six from the Co-operative movement (two from the Co-operative Union, two from the Co-operative Wholesale Society, and two from the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers).   This committee shall have power to co-opt.(b) Local ?ood Strike Committees, similarly composed of representatives of the Co-operative Co-ioittees, employees and the Unions affected,&quot;The area covered by the local Committee will generally be the area covered&quot;by the Co-operative Society.   Where several Societies serve one district, the local Food Committee should comprise representatives from each of these Societies.   To secure additional sources of supply, it may be convenient to bring into the scheme private trader^ who will accept the Triple Alliance coupons.&quot;The agreement between the movement and the Triple Alliance would be that, in return for coupons issued by the Triple Alliance, the Co-operative 3tores -would give food to each person on strike up to the amount of his strike pay, the co-operative staffs forming the skeleton organisation of,distribution,&quot;To cope with the rush entailed by this scheme, four things are necessary:.   (a)/
ARHBSTS &amp; convictions on May 19th Thomas Wilson was sentenced at Plymouth to three months1 hard labour for attempting to cause disaffection among His Majesty&apos;s Forces.On May 20th Hedley, alias OlHagan, alias Osborne, was sentenced at Portsmouth to six months1 hard labour for attempting to cause disaffection in the Navy and Army.-On the same day G.Vf. Fren&amp;ley was sentenced  it Portsmouth to six weeks1 hard labour for making statements likely to cause disaffection in the Navy and Army.On May 20th J.V. Leckie was sentenced at Birmingham. . to three months1 imprisonment in the Second Division for*aX speech made in that city on 27.1.21.    He has been &quot;on the run&quot;/(a) All Co-operative halls, Socialist club rooms, miners1 institutes, and whatever halls in oonveni&amp;afc centres oan be secured, should be made into Depots for food distribution,(b) The Co-operative employees should be diluted by volunteers (Women1 s Co-operative Guilds, strikers1 wives, etcJj   the skilled assistants axfl Branch managers acting as foreman.(c) The rationing of goods, of which there is, or is likely to be a shortage.   The Co-operative managers could easily organise this on the basis of their war experience.(d) Arrangements for Communal meals to conserve available supplies.(e) The success of the whole scheme depends upon the immediate removal by the Co-operative Society into its own possession of all itsstores of food, fuel, petrol, forage, etc., which &apos; may be lying in warehouses, railway stations, etc., and the securing of what further supplies it is possible to get hold ofT       This must be done &apos; immediately, and before&quot;the strike takes effect, so that the stores may be in our hands before the Government commandeers the larger accumulations of supplies.&quot;After the strike has begun no supplies can be removed by railwaymen and transport workers, except for and by the permit of the Strike    Pood Committee. Hospitals, children^ milk etc, must only be supplied through the Strike Organisation.   Supplies to the local Strike Food Committee will be arranged by the National Food Committee.&quot;
run&quot; since that date and new threatens to hunger strike. Extracts from his speech were given in my report       91.On May 21st C.T. fvoodhead, a member of the Sheffield Communist Party, was sentenced to three months&apos; hard labour and fined  100 (or in default of payment a further three months&apos; imprisonment in the Second Division) for a speech made at Pontefract.Qd llay 21st Harry Pollitt, the London organiser of the Red Trade Union International, was arrested for speeches made et Plymouth on Mey 14th,and Uay 15th; on the latter date he addressed an audience of 2,000, the largest communist meeting ever held in Plymouth.On I&amp;y 23rd James Bown was bound over for 12 months in the sum of  50 and ordered to find two sureties of  25 each.   Bown was allowed 48 hours in which to find the sureties, but refused to bo bound over and has now been sentenced to two months&apos; imprisonment.On May 24th John Trotter, Henry Shepperson and William 3rain were sentenced at Birmingham to six weeks&apos; imprisonment in the Second Division for speeches delivered in the Bull Ring on May 13th.SIM- FEIN III GREAT 3KI?AIHThere was an outbreak of inc-endiarism on the Tyneside and Tees-side in tne night of May 21st.   Over thirty hay stacks and one timber yard were fired, a watermain at Long Newton was blown up and a gas main at East Jarrow ?/as damaged by explosives.   Three men, one of whom is the local president of the Irish Self-Determination League, were arrested.On May 21st a motor-boat house at v/allsead was set on fire, damage to the extent of about  100 being done.   Two mennamed/
named John McAlindon and James Oonroy were arrested: each v/as in possession of a loaded revolver hut made no use of them to avoid arrest,   Two other men managed to escape hut efforts are being made to trace them.Cn May 23rd several haystacks wero fired at a farm occupied by a Mr. dimmer, at Roby, near Liverpool, and a Police officer, whose attention was drawn to the farm by the blazing hay, was fired at several times by three men but was not hit.   A few months ago when a number of farm fires occurred in Liverpool District, i*r. Rimmer challenged two suspicious looking men, firing and wounding one, who was found to be a Sinn Peiner.   It is, therefore, thought that last night&apos;s outrage was an act of vengeance.An unsuccessful attempt v/as made to enter the military barracks in Botanic Road, Liverpool, on Hay 24th; and it is thought that Sinn Feiners may have been implicated.Greenspon, who has for some time been active in the South Wales coalfield, addressed a meeting at Bury on May 17th; he denoimced the Royal Irish Constabulary Auxiliaries and said that it was &quot;up to every Irishman to fight to the bitter end - there v/as no solution other than an Irish Republic&quot;.   At the close of the meeting a collection was taken for the &quot;clothing and feeding of expelled workers&quot; from Belfast.The police raids made in London have caused Sinn Ftaners much anxiety and apprehension.   Irish people who have hitherto been outspoken in their sympathy for Sinn Fein have become reticeMy Glasgow correspondent reports that only  2,000 have been collected as the result of John OrSheehan&apos;s efforts to raise  10,000 in Scotland.   Rumours are current that-an attempt will bs made to rescue by force those Sinn Peiners who are awaiting trial in connection with the recent outrages.IRELAND/
- IS -ireland on May 25th Sinn Feiners set fire to Dublin Cuotoros Rouse by means of petrol, cotton waste arid bombs: the Fire Brigade was held up at its station bj,- armed man and bombs were thrown on the nolice and through some of the windows of the Customs Rouse.   A fight developed between the forces of the Crown and Sinn Seiners, in the course of wuioh there were casualties on both sides.Robbery -under arms is increasing; bicycles, field-glasses and telescopes are being stolen in large numbers, acts which foreshadow operations on a more ambitious scale than has hitherto been indicated.   Typed notices have been posted in some parts of the country warning men between the ages of 19 and 30 years that they are liable for service with the Irish Republican Army and instructing them to be ready to join up at a minute&apos;a notice.      There are indications of further attacks on the Crown Forces and on Government buildings.Sinn Fein casualties during the week have been very heavy and have included some of the more important officers and the Crown Forces have seized a considerable number of arms.   It is believed that the urgent appeal to America for  250,000 has failed.The Sinn Fein &quot;Government&quot; has issued a apecial number of the &quot;Irish Bulletin&quot; to ex-plain tne murders of Hiss Barrington and Hrs. Blake whion are described as &quot;lamentable tragedies&quot;.   It is added that &quot;British officers engaged in this war have no right to go about accomoanied by ladies and expect immunity on that account.&quot;
