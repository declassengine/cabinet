&apos;   /-&quot;siJh61THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.RET.CABINET.2998--* DISPOSAL OF OVERSEAS PRIZE,memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade,.Sir Joseph Maclay, who was dealing with this question of overseas prize at the Ministry of Shipping, asks me to place before the Cabinet his views on the Treasury memorandum, (CP.2982).The proposal in that memorandum is that we should inform the Dominions at once that we are prepared to relinquish all our claims to the ex-enemy ships detained in the Dominions, and to the value of them on certain conditions.It is not likely that either Australia or India will be willing to give up any of the ships they have seized, or any portion of the value of them.    But the claim of the United Kingdom is a strong one ]?oth in law and equity, and If we have to give up our rights there ought to be material for making a bargain with the Dominions in whose favour they are surrendered.Sir Joseph Maclay would therefore suggest that unless the Colonial Office have come very strong special reasons for wishing to announce the concession at once, the matter should be held over till the Imperial Cabinet meets and discussed with the representatives of the Dominions as an open question.STANLEY BALDWIN.31st May, 1921.
