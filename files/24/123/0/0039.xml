Copy No.__J____CP,-29 34. 0 A B I N 3 T,REPORT BY THE GENERAL OFFICER CQ&amp;iAN DING-IN-CHIEF ON THE GENERAL SITUATION IN IRELAND ?OR WEEK ENDING 7th MAY 1921.(Circulated by tho Secretary of State for War.)1b CT^RAL,MILITARY SITUATION.Tho Military Situation has not BffSjTjl-plly changed since my last report.      Outrages have irtoreasMyam^have on ono or two occasions boon on a father larger scale than has been tho case for the past month, but it cannot from this be assumed that a recrudescence of tho activities of Flying Columns t&amp; imminent, It is still roporto a from the Martial Law Area that the fighting spirit of the rebols met in conflict is not what it wa3 two months ago.The murdor of civilians shows no sign of decrease, and there has been an increase in attacks upon individual policemen.In Dublin there frsvcs been no outrages of any importance during the week;   transport appears still to bo the chief objective of the rebels.   Arms and explosives are still being found In con-side rable numbers during searchos in Dublin by troops and police.In the oountry there have been three outstanding collisions with rebels, in both of whioh the Crown Forces showed conspicuous coolnoss and Initiative in dealing with the situation, and, under skilful leadership, inflicted considerable loss upon the rebels.These engagements, of which details will be found in Appendix I. took place at Kil&amp;orrery. Co. Cork, Emly, Co, Tipperary and in the Partry Mountains, Co. Mayo.   In the first of those two rebels were killed, and 5 captured with three rifles, some bombs and ammunition;   in the, second a bicycle patrol of troops and R.I.C. numbering only 14 engaged a largo body of rebols, estimated at 200.      The Crown Forces killed at least seven of tho rebels, wounded many others and captured some arms, ammunition and explosives.     The engagement in the Partry Mountains took place on the arrival of troops and police, after tho rebels had ambushed and killed a R.I.C. Sergt. and 3 constables.   In the fight which ensuod, ten to fifteen rebels wore killed or wounded;   20 shot guns, 4 rifles and 2 pistols woro captured.In addition to tho three engagements above, a mixed party of police and troops, In an operation near Gootshill, Co.cavan, captured 11 rebels all armed with rifles.A &quot;drive&quot; on a considerable scale in the district between Mullingar Oo.V/eatmeath, and Tullamore, Kingrs County, has been organised by the G.0.C 5th Division.   Four Cavalry Regiments are being employed.   The drive is still in progress and full details have not yet been received.     It Is however known that a large number of men have been rounded up and searched;   the majority of those have been subsequently released, but several Jwanted1 have boon captured.
Rumours continue to be received regarding the landing or intended landing of arms at various points on the coast.    Up to now no trace of these landings he a  been discovered, although the Naval patrols havo had instructions to watch for them.   I am inclined to balievo that tihere is some truth in these rumours and I am convinced, after correspondence with the Admiral Commander-in-Ohief v/oatern Approaches, that the resources at his disposal for the prevention of gun-running*at small places on the coast, are inadequate.     I have raised this point previously more especially in connection with the necessity for craft capable of navigating estuaries and tidal rivers, and X consider the question of additional safeguards in this respect to bo a mattor of great urgency.    Arms are being captured by the troops and police in largo quantities now and if full advantage is to be gained from their activities, there must bo no chance of theso arms being replaced by&apos;further importations.There is nothing further to report regarding the Elections, While I do not anticipate -&apos;.?ny general disturbances, there is little doubt that in some places, more particularly probably in the North, collisions between rival parties, or intimidation by Sinn IPoin will occur,     X have informed the Civil Authorities that every facility will be given In the Martial Law Area and elsewhere for the holding of Meetings, issue of motor permits, etc., for the conduct of the elections, but that I am not pre-pared to move troops f-om their normal stations, for the purpose of Safeguarding polling stations, although troops will as far as possiblev be available for the suppression of serious dis-turbance3 whioh actually breaii out*(Signed)     CP J7,MAC READY..GEHEBAL, Commanding-in-Chief, IRELAND.G.H.Q.
