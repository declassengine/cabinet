[this document is the property of hip britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet. , secret. C.P.-2957.ANGLO-JAPANESE ALLIANCE.memorandum by the first lord of the admiralty.IN about three weeks time the Imperial Conference will meet, and one of the first questions that must come before it will be the renewal, or termination, of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. Meanwhile such expressions of opinion as have reached us from the Dominion Governments reveal such acutely divergent views on this all-important subject that, unless these differences can be composed, there will be a risk of a schism within the Empire which might have disastrous results upon both our domestic and foreign relations.Even if the interests of the United Kingdom had alone to be considered, the decision for or against renewal would be one of great perplexity, upon which, so far as I am aware, the Cabinet has not yet had an opportunity of pronouncing any opinion. Under these circumstances it seems essential that the matter should be discussed in Cabinet without further delay, in order that the Government should at least make up its own mind as to the policy to be pursued and as to the line which it is to take at the coming Imperial Conference.Effect on Naval Policy.For the Admiralty the need for a decision is peculiarly urgent, as it is impracticable to frame, still more to discuss, a &apos;Naval policy for the Empire until the problem of the Pacific has assumed more permanent shape. This means not only that the Admiralty would be unable to give more than academic and incon-clusive advice to the Dominions with regard to their part and share in the Naval defence of the Empire, but that the strength and distribution of the British Fleet would remain undetermined and its cost an uncertain charge upon the Exchequer.It is becoming increasingly obvious that both our Naval policy and our future relations with the United States are intimately bound up in this problem of the Pacific, and that our association with Japan, valuable though it be, cannot for one moment compare with the vital importance of our relationship with America.It is therefore essential that we should realise, and give full weight to, not merely the views but the prejudices of the American people and Government with regard to this question.Japan and the United States.That the Americans fear and distrust Japan is not open to doubt, and they have some reason to do so, even if their apprehensions are often exaggerated. Throughout the Pacific Coast States, and also in British Colombia, there is a pronounced hostility to the Japanese which might at any moment provoke a casus belli. The late President Roosevelt told me, on more than one occasion, that nothing caused him more constant anxiety during his Administration than the capacity (and sometimes the apparent readiness) of California to involve the United States in a war with Japan without the Federal Government having any say in the matter.American Naval Policy.Our Alliance with Japan is therefore, however unreasonably, a constant source of misunderstanding and irritation in America, and no amount of explanation of its innocuous character can soothe American nerves or explain away suspicion of its objects. . This being the case the Jingoes in Congress and elsewhere find no difficulty in persuading the American people that their safety and prestige rest upon the creation of a Navy which shall be not only decisively superior to that of Japan but strong enough to face any possible combination.[6276]
Tins fear of Japan, and dislike of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, is the real driving force behind the 1916 and subsequent Navy Bills, and there is, I am convinced, no prospect of any agreement on Armaments unless and until these disturbing factors can-be got out of the way.The renewal, or termination, of the Alliance is therefore not merely a Foreign Office question but an intimate concern of both the Admiralty and the Treasury.The &quot; One-Power &quot; Standard.So far as purely Naval Policy is concerned, the duty of the Admiralty is clear. It is to give effect to the decision of the Government repeatedly declared that the British Fleet is to be maintained at a strength not inferior to that of any foreign Power. This means, at present, that its strength must be not inferior to that of the American Navy, and entails, in the absence of any agreement, a fresh competition in building, which would revive, and far surpass, the strain of our pre-war race with Germany. This is an intolerable prospect which can only be dispelled by reassuring America both as to our intentions and her safety in the Pacific. The latter is mainly a strategic question, too technical to discuss here, but certain facts leap at once to the eye.The Problem of the Pacific.In the Philippines and Guam, both practically undefended, America has adopted hostages to fortune which would involve her in certain and immediate losses in the event of war with Japan. Apart from these places, she possesses no practicable bases of operation in the Pacific, Honolulu being further from Japan than New York is from England. America is therefore being goaded by her fears into creating a great Pacific fleet and advanced bases for it at Guam and elsewhere. Her per-turbation about Yap is due to the same cause. Her eye is not on us, but the Japanese Alliance makes us suspect, and we have no alternative but to stagger along under our financial burdens in the effort, which is an obligation, to keep pace with American naval expansion. It is a vicious circle of ever widening evil, from which there seems no escape unless statesmanship comes to the rescue.The Position in Japan.It is not the object of this memorandum to impute blame to either America or Japan, but merely to point out the growing dangers of the situation. These are intensified by the position in Japan itself, where circumstances have combined to produce an atmosphere very favourable to war.Apart from the fact that America is as much disliked and distrusted in Japan as Japan is in America, and that the Japanese are saturated with high-flown and dangerous ambitions in China and the Pacific, there are certain disturbing factors which may be summarised as follows : For some years past the growth of social unrest, and even Communism, in Japan has greatly alarmed both the Government and the business community. So serious has it become, indeed, that the temptation to evoke a counter-wave of patriotism and national solidarity by plunging into war has played into the hands of the Jingoes and the very Prussian-minded military caste. The latter, always somewhat entete, despise American preparedness and believe that the moment is opportune for striking a blow which would cause the Philippines and Guam to fall like ripe plums and give Japan the undisputed control of the Pacific. Their attitude towards the Anglo-Japanese Alliance is largely one of indifference; they know we would never help them in a war with United States, but they see a certain advantage in our enforced, if unsympathetic, neutrality.This unhealthy war atmosphere is stimulated by the obvious inability of the Japanese taxpayer to maintain much longer the strain of competitive naval expansion. At the present moment no less than one-third Of the total revenue is absorbed by the navy estimates and fully one-half by the combined naval and military expenditure. In a financial contest the long purse of America is bound to win and hence the temptation for Japan to escape bankruptcy by an early and Victorious conflict.British Interests and the Pacific.If the foregoing is a correct diagnosis of a grave and inflammable situation, it is important to determine, accurately and dispassionately, where British interests
lie and what our policy should be in the event of war between Japan and America. Obviously it would be undesirable that we should be involved on one side or the other, but especially on the side of Japan. Nor, in the long run, should we profit by adopting the role of tertius gaudens. Still less could we afford to see America beaten.It is difficult to see, under these conditions, what advantage we could derive from the continued existence of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. It is certainly not to the interests of the British Empire that Japan should hold Guam and the Philippines, or in any way strengthen her position in the Pacific. Yet, if we were her ally even though a neutral in her war with America how could we restrain Japan from using her best and quite legitimate weapon in striking at the nearest American bases ?On the other hand it may be said, and indeed it is the main argument, that the Alliance guarantees the security of British possessions and of British trade in the Pacific. To a certain extent, and for so long as the Alliance lasts, that is perhaps true, but are the risks so great and can our interests be secured in no other way than one which is objectionable to America, which keeps inflamed other minor causes of friction with her, and which kills any possibility of an agreement about armaments ?Alternatives to the Alliance.The ideal alternative, of course, would be to substitute an American for the Japanese Alliance, but, in the present temper of Congress, that would not be practical politics. Short of that, and in view of the genuine if groundless apprehension with which Americans regard the Alliance, it seems likely that they would make very great concessions on many points now in dispute, and accept real equality of naval strength (even though it involved a curtailment of their building programmes) if we would disentangle ourselves from Japan and come to some formal possibly tripartite agreement for the defence of our respective and legitimate interests in the Pacific.The Need for Prompt Decision.If anything is to be done on these lines, it is essential that the ground should be explored before the Imperial Conference meets. The presence in London of the new American Ambassador, and of the Japanese statesmen in attendance on the Crown Prince, seems to afford a favourable opportunity. The difficulties are admittedly great, but they are nothing to those which will ensue if the Imperial Conference breeds a schism in the Empire on this delicate and dangerous question and if the matter is allowed to drift until an explosion occurs which may plunge America and Japan into a war, the consequences of which no man can foresee.L of F.May 21, 1921.
