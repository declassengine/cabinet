%t.THIS WtftlENT 13 THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAIN 10 MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT)S E C R E&apos; T. r TTHE EXTENSION 0.? MARTIAL LAW IN IRELAND AND THE CONSEQUENT NAVAL AND MILITARY MEASURES *(Regort by the t 0haimanf the Irish Situation Committee).On Tuesdayf May 24th, 1921, the Cabinet deoided as follows (Cabinet 41 (21) Conclusion (3) (a) - (f)):-(a) That reinforcements, to the extent that the War Office can spare them, should be sent to Ireland as soon as possible to enable the General Officer Commanding -in-Chief to make the fullest possible preparations for their use in the event of it becoming necessary to set up Crown Colony Government and to extend the martial law area;(b) that the&apos;amount of these forces should be considered, in the first instance, by the Secretary of State for War,the Pirst Lord of the Admiralty, the Secretary of State for Air,in consultation withthe Chief of the Imperial General Staff, the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief in Irelend,and other Naval, Military or Air Experts as required;(c) That the proposals cf the three Service Departments, as provided in (b), should be considered by the Irish Situation Committee;(d) That every preparation..sh.o.uld. be made by the Irish Government for the establish-ment (if His Majesty&apos;s Government should so decide) of Crown Colony Governmentin the whole of the area of the Parliament of Southern Ireland, and. for the imposition of martial law in such part of it as His Majesty&apos;s Government may decide, after July 12th, in the event of a refusal on the part of Southern Ireland to put in operation the Government of Ireland Act;(e),   That the Irish Situation Committee should consider the extent to -which martial law should be imposed in Southern Ireland after July 12th, and should report their recommendations to the Cabinet;
(f)   That the Irish Situation Committee, which last met in August 1920, and has lapsed, s h o ulo, b e r e o o n s t i t u te d.In accordance with the above decisions the Irish Situation Committee have held a meeting at whioh the Naval, Military and Air experts wore present.tension The Committee considered first the question of the&quot;Mar-aT law. extension of martial law to cover tho 26 Irish counties outside Ulster.     The advantages of such extension would be: -(1)     The forces in Ireland would be under onecontrol.     This Will lead.to stricter discipline and greater efficiency.   At present outside the martial law area there are two bodies of men under two commands, , and great care has to be exercised to avoid friction;(2)     The same treatment can be extended to ailrebels apprehended outside Ulster.   At present in the martial law area,a man found carrying fire-arms without a permit is liable to the death penalty under martial law, whereas outside the area the death penalty can only be inflicted after a lengthy legal procedure, (which is in fact not resorted to), and the offender escapes with a few months imprisonment;(3)     In the martial law area the press can be controlled, and the control where already exercised has done good;(4)     Martial law will be a substitute forauthorised reprisals which are disliked by the military, but which couicl not be abandoned without something to take their place;(5)    Martial law need not be enforced with equalseverity in all places.   It is the Commander-- in-Chief2s intention to enforce it where, and to the degree, wanted, but the extension of the martial law ares will enable him -instantly to take severe measures in any part of Ireland outside Ulster.Generally speaking the declaration of martial lawover the whole of Ireland will greatly assist the Forcesof the Grown in their task,       It will prevent the escape .of Sinn Fein gun-men frcfjn martial law areas to other areas with a view to avoiding the.&apos;penalties for carrying
leinforoer lent 8.. Ior &apos;eland -feiare .- -Sly 12th.arras, and will, it is hoped, be the principal means of securing the disarmament of the civil population -whioh is the essential preliminary to the paoifioa-tion of Ireland. .As regards the date of the extension cf martial law, the Committee are of opinion that this should be July 12th next, in the event of the Southern Parliament failing to function,   This date will  ive ample notice to the Irish people and will enable the necessary military preparations to be made.   The Committee consider that this policy should be announced at onoe.      A prompt announcement will encourage the Crown Foroes in Ireland and will help to bring de Valera to terms.If it becomes.necessary to.extend martial law to the 2&apos;6 counties, the Committee are impressed with the necessity of strengthening the present forces in Ireland -The memorandum furnished by the Commander-in-Chief of the forces in Ireland (C.P.2965) states that the activity&apos;of the troops in Ireland is directed towards countering the pressure&apos; of the 1.3.A. whenever that becomes prominent, and little more than this can be done on account&apos; of insufficiency of numbers and the consequent strain on the troops.   If a great effort is to be made during the fine weather of this summer to pacify&apos;Ireland, the Army in Ireland must be re-inforoed as soon as conditions in this oountry permit. Without- this the extension of the martial law area, will be fruitless.   The Committee understand that all the-troops withdrawn from Ireland on account of the ooal strike have; now returned to Ireland.   So far as can be estimated by the Chief of the Imperial General
Staff, the War Offioe can, within the next fewweeks (if tho coal strike is settled) despatch toIreland between 16 ;.;.nd 18 Infantry Battalions ofa strength varying from 400 to 600 men por Battalion.In addition the War Office can despatch 2 or 3 cavalry regiments or their equivalent.as regards help from the Royal Air Faroe, theCommittee ha^e been Informed that the Royal Air Forcein Ireland have been supplied with all the aeroplanesthey need and that no reinforcements are necessaryin order to enable them to carry out adequately thework which is required of therruThe Committee recommend that reinforcementsshould bo sent to Ireland, -iii as large numbers aspossible and as early as the industrial situationin Britain will&quot;admit.aval The CQimmnder-ih-Chief of the Ponces&apos; in Ireland,assistance.has emphasised the necessity of assistance from the Navy .&apos; .ootii in order to prevent the importation of arms into Ireland and to&apos; restrict the movement of rebels.   He informed the Committee that reoently during a large drive by the military about 100 Sinn Feiners were rounded up on an estuary to a river, but escaped across the river in boats.   If this drive had been conducted with the oo-operation of Naval foroes the rebels could not have escaped.Tho Committee think lt essential that the Navy should oo-oporato to the fullest extent possible with- tho Army in Ireland, and should be responsible for examining vessels approaching   and leaving tho Irish coasts.The Committee consider that tho details of a plan. Iof co-operation between the Navy and tho Army should be jsettlod:between the Commander-in-Chief in Ireland and Ithe Naval Commander-in-Chief and referred to the Admiralty,    I
\ fi. 56083 of Marines, In view of the calls made on the Arrayin this country, in Ireland, and in foreign countries, the Committee consider that every effort should he made to use as many marines as possible in Ireland and that the Admiralty should he asked ti make available if possible, one or more Battaliona for use by the Army in Ireland.The following is a summary of the recommendations which the Committee put forward for the approval ef the Cabinet(l)    To proclaim Martial Law in the 26 ccunties on July 12th next if the Southern Parliament d&amp;es not function)(2)    To announce this pblicy at once;(3)    That re-lnforuements ho oent to Ireland in as large numbers as possible and ao early as the industrial situation in Britain admits(4)    That Sir 1, Macready should take &amp;n early opportunity of discussing with the Uaval Commander-in-Chief the nature of the ITaval co-operation required, so that the Admiral    may submit his plans to the Admiralty;(5)    That the Admiralty should place at thedisposal of the Naval Oonsnander^ih-Chief, the force necessary to enable him to co-operate effectively with the Military Authorities in combined operations;(6)    That the Admiralty should be aeked to make available, if possible, 1 or more Battalions of marines to be placed at the disposal of the War Office for use in Ireland.(initialled)   A.
