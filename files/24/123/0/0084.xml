THIS DOOMS NT IS THE PROPERTY 0.? HIS BRITANNIC JiAJBSTY* S - GOVERBMBNT&quot;) *SSORH. , Copy No,C.P^2977,CABINS TaSURVEY OF THE STATE OP IRELAND FOR WSSK EN DSD 23rd MAY, 1921,.(0 iroiila tod by t he Chlefj? eg re tary for Ireland.)I submit for the consideration of the (cabinet my survey for the week ended the 23rd instant. STOSRAL STATE OF TH5 COUNTRY.    &quot; Statistics of Outrages.The intensified campaign of murder which commenced on the 14th instant, the day following the Southern Elections, has continued with unabated ferocity throughout the whole of the past week, and the casualties both to the Crown Forces and to civilians have again been heavy. &apos;   The number of police and military casualties (57 including 25 deaths) is 2 in excess of that of the previous week, which as stated in my last report was the highest recorded for any single week since 1916.     In addition 8 murders of civilians, attributable to Sinn Fein were reported and 6 esses of attempted murder.     A feature of.recent rebel activities lie the increased number i of assassinations as distinguished from attacks of a semi-mili-taty character.     At least 11 of the murders of members of the /Crown Forces were committed in circumstances which afforded /the victims no opportunity of defence, and in only two of the many ambushes of police patrols which occurred during the week-could the opportunity be said really to have existod.    The first of these two cases was an ambush of a police cycling patrol consisting of a Sergeant and four Constables which took place at Ballinarea, Queens bounty about 3/45 p.m.
485on the 16th instant.     After a brief engagement the ambushing . party cf at least twenty armed men were completely beaten off. leaving two of their number dead^ and 4 shot grns and a small quantity of ammunition were captuswdby the police whose only casualty was one constable slightly wounded.    The other encounter whioh occurred at Kilmeena, Co. Mayo on the 19th instant was cn a mere extended scale.    The police party on this occasion which consisted of a District Inspector and twenty other ranks succeeded in carrying out an effective counter attack and after fierce fighting drove their assailants who numbered about sixty from a strongly entrenched position. Four rebels were killed and five prisoners, four of whom were wounded, wore captured by the police together with a considerable quantity of arms, bombs and ammunition.    The police casualties were one constable killed and a head constable seriously wounded. The only other engagement of importance during the week was an attack on the police Barrack at Eewpcrt, Co. Mayo on the 18th instant In rjhich an attacking party cf about&apos;fifty rebels were engaged^    A police sergeant was mortally wounded at the commencement of the attack and a constable was slightly wounded at a later stage but -;he attack was eventually beaten off without damage to the barrack.    10 other attempts on occupied police barracks were made during the weak, in each case without success.-   Of the 8 civilians murdered.by Sinn Fein during the week 5 were ex-service men.   In one case the murdered man who had been fired at and wounded the previous day was taken out of Jervis Street -Hospital, Dublin, on a stretcher by Sinn Feiners and shot dead outside the door.Other outrages for the week included 49 raids on mails, 4 raids on Coastguard Stations, three of which, Milleave and
486Rosabar, both in Go. Cork, and Portnoo, Co. Donegal were destroyed, and 3 raids for arms.Arrests for outrages and political offenoos numbered 69 for the week.Trials of Civilians by Court Martial.Forty-nine trjsLa of civilians by Court Martial were concluded during the week, resulting in thirty-six: convictionsand thirteen acquittals.    The following is an analysis of the sentences imposed in the cases, of oonviction:17 sentences of penal Servitude (3 years to 15 years)10       n       of Imprisonment with (6 months to Z years) hard 3ehour2       w       of Imprisonment with- (6 months to 2 years)out hard labour 7 Fines       (10/- to  bO).The acquittals included the cose of a constable of the royal irish Constabulary who was accused of theft.   Sentences of15 years penal servitude were imposed in two oases of conviction-on a charge of shooting with attempt to murder, one in Co,Donegal and the other in Co, Cork and sentence of 12 years penal servitude in the case of a man convicted of holding up a soldierwith a revolver and depriving him of official correspondence.Sentence of five years penal servitude was imposed in threecases for the destruction of a bread van near Strabane, CcDerryin connection with the boycott of Belfast trade.Internment Orders.The following figures show the present position as regards internments: -Total number of internment orders made.............3,328Orders cancelled for reasons other than release87Releases ordered.......................187Numbed of persons now interned.....................3,054The number of appeals at present awaiting hearing is 29.

488PRESENT POLITICAL SITUATION IU IRELAND.Public interest throughout the whole-of^Ireland-is -centred for the moment in the Elections for the House of Commons of the Northern Parliament, which take place to-day. The results of the Southern Elections were, in every ease, a foregone conclusion and except in so far as they have served to regularise the position of Mr. De Valora and his followers under the Government of Ireland Act for the purpose of any negotiations that may be attempted between representatives of the north and South, their-, immediate effect upon the political situation is comparatively negligible.   - With the northern Elections the case is different.&apos;&quot;  Whatever the polling results may be the holding of these Elections at the present juncture is an event which promises to have an important influence on future Irish political developments, somo of which influence is already discernible.     The recent meeting of Sir James Craig and Mr. De Valera may Justly be regarded as among the first fruits . of the policy of the Government of Ireland Act, which differs from the policies of previous Home Rule Bills in.that its guiding motive is to throw the Irish people upon their own resources of statesmanship for the settlement of the difficultie arising from the racial and religious separation of Ulster from the rest of the country.     Of&apos;oven greater significance than this single meeting between; the two leaders has been the noticeable tendency, increasing as the Election campaign   , proceeded for the question of the future re-integration of-Ireland as a political unit to be approached by speakers on both sides in a manner which suggests that the ties of national sentiment between the two sections of the people -are likely to prove stronger than their traditional aiii/Voathies.     To. this tentative effort at co-operation trie
489most practical, contribution oil the part of. Sinn,Pain, has been the tacit abandonment of republicanism as an immediate policy.       I attach a copy of the Address issued by Mr. De Yalora on the eve of the Elections,(initialled)     H,GoIRISH OFFICE, S-W.l* 24th May. 19SI.
Address by Uxv De Valera before NorthernElse fcions.4&quot;Men and women of North-East Ulster, politicians and statesmen declare tho Irish 1 problem insoluble, but you, the plain people can solve it in a few hours tc-morrow in the quiet and privacy of the polling bootho&quot;Had the distracted peoples of Europe in 1914 your chance,- there would have been no war, and Europe would not have been made doselate, with a greater desola-tion awaiting it In its * statesmen&apos;e1 poace*&quot;Vote to-morrow against war with your fellow-country-men, vote that brother7e hand may not have to be raised against brother1s veto so that there may be an end to boycott and retaliation, to partition, disunion, and ruin,&quot;Lead tho world by your example.   Make a genuine people18 peace.   Live in history as having&apos; created a truly united Irish nations    Orange and Green together can command the future.
