Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.I circulate to my colleagues a collection of telegrams which have passed between the Government oi&apos; India and mvself on the subject of Afghanistan.E. S. M.6th Mav 1921.From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, \2tli April 1931, Clear the line.518 S. Secret. Afghanistan. Following from IKjWjs, 85 0., dated 10th April :-&quot; My telegram of 6th April, 82 C. Tarsi, in official letter, had fixed yesterday for tho final official meeting, and 11th April for farewell audience of the Amir. In the meantime Amirs favourite uncle died, and olhcial business was suspended for three days. Nevertheless, I insisted that Mission must leave on the 12th instant. Amir then sent word that he would receive a visit of condolence from me yesterday in the Foreign Office. Muspratt, Nawab, and 1 had long interview. After much beating about the bush, Amir said he could not understand how, when both countries sincerely desired friendship, we could break off negotiations over trifling differences. 1 said Tarsi had insisted that Afghan draft, containing stipulations which were impossible of acceptance, was the last word. Amir said there was no reason why discussions should not continue and Afghan draft be modified. I told him the point(s) we consider objectionable. It then appeared that the.main difficulties in the Amir&apos;s mind were the Russian Consulates in Eastern Afghanistan, and the conditions about the import of arms. Regarding Consulates, he said he recognised the justice of our objections, and Tarsi admitted that the main consideration given to Russia in the treaty was Eastern Consulates, sole object of which, he agrees, was to stir up trouble in India. But Amir said he had given his word to Russians, and felt it very difficult to take it back, even though technically he could still refuse to ratify tin? treaty. Both he and Tarsi asked my advice as a friend as to how they should get out of the difficulty. 1 asked if they had threatened S. with British Consulates on the Russian Frontier. They said yes, and S. had replied  British might have 10 Consulates there for all he minded. I then suggested that they should explain to S. that Eastern Consulates would force Afghanistan into enmity with British. They said that it would not have any effect. If they refused Consulates, Russia would probably refuse to make treaty, withdraw offer of subsidy and return of Panjdeh, and either attack Afghanistan or ruin her by propaganda and encouragement of young Afghan party. They could hardly forego the advantages and incur these dangers without some really substantial aid from us. Tarsi asked whether we could give Afghanistan definite assurance(s) of support if she incurred Russian enmity by refusal of Consulates. I said 1 should have to refer the matter, but something of the kind had been considered at the time of the overthrow of Bokhara, and there might be a possibility of a gift of arms, vide Secretary of State&apos;s telegram. 2284 of zlth October. 1 said that the oiler of cession of Panjdeh was probably illusory, as Russians would see to it that Turkomans should vote in favour of remaining under Russia. Regarding import of arms, Amir said he understood Arms Traffic Convention had virtually lapsed, and he earnestly desired right of unconditional import. I said that this might also be referred. It was then settled that 1 should refer the question of assurance(s) and extent; of help in arms in the event of Russian aggression, and question of unconditional importation of arms, and that Tarsi and 1 would discuss the remaining points at private conference of 11th April. J made it clear that cession of Arnawai and Afghan proposals regarding tribes were impossible. Amir and Tarsi were both extraordinarily friendly and open in manner, and evicjently dread breach with us, but are genuinely perplexed about Consulates. It seems clear that it has now come to a definite choice between British and Russians, who regard the Consulates as the clou of the treaty and the only valuable consideration which they are to receive. If His Majesty&apos;s Government can induce Russians to forego the Consulates, difficulties disappear. If not, Afghans will not make treaty with us excluding Eastern Consulates without suggested assurance&apos;^) 3926     100 5.21 A
of help against Russia anjj,, I.*believe, without increased (? subsidy) to make up for offer which Russia will withdraw. I suggest that His JVlajesty&apos;s Government be now moved to put great pressure on Russians regarding the Consulates, and to demand early reply. If they cannot do this, we must realise the Afghans can only comply with our demands at the greatest risk of rupture with Russia, and will not run the risk without support and (? subsidy) indicated. I hope that I may receive very early indication of the policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government desires to pursue.&quot;We urge that pressure he now put on Russians for early reply regarding Consulates in Eastern Afghanistan. Our further comments on Dobbs&apos; telegram are reserved, pending clearing up of certain points which are being referred back to him.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, ]bth April 1021.Clear the line.2028. Secret. Afghanistan. Your telegram of the 12th. After consultation with the Foreign Oflice, it seems to me to be unwise to put pressure on Russians regarding Consulates in Eastern Afghanistan.His Majesty&apos;s Government have no reason at present to repose much faith in the bona fides of the Russian Government.They will probably ask us what right we have to object to Consulates in a free Afghanistan, allege that they are placed there for trade, give us an assurance that they will not be used for propaganda, and say that if we find that they are, we can bring to them specific acts which we regard as a breach of the trade agreement.A reply on these lines might be very good propaganda for them with the Afghans.Alternatively, again, they might agree to drop the Consulates, and then the rest of the treaty might be concluded and might be found to contain other objectionable matter, including possibly an alternative method of doing the work which the Consulates were designed to do.For these reasons 1 deprecate the course which Dobbs advocates and you endorse. On the other hand, he seems to have established at the moment an advantageous position for detaching the Afghans from the Bolsheviks by a comprehensive offer of assistance from us, and I shall be glad to have your further views with definite indication of the length to which you are prepared to go in providing money and arms.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 15th April 1921.Private and personal. Please see your official telegram on Afghanistan of the 12th April and my reply of to-day&apos;s date.I have consulted Curzon, and although I have not taken the matter to the Cabinet, you may like to get our preliminary views in explanation of what amounts to turning down your suggestion about pressure upon the Russians. It would appear to us that Dobbs has now an admirable opportunity of bringing the whole policy to success.   Why should he not now address the Amir in this sense ? :-You have asked my advice as a friend and the assistance of the British Empire if the Russians attack you. If you will sign our treaty of friendship without any further demur, we will certainly undertake to give you money and arms, and we-will allow you, not necessarily permanently, the further importation of arms to defend yourself against the Russians, provided that you break with the Russians and repudiate the proposed treaty that awaits ratification. By breaking with the Bolsheviks we do not mean attacking them, and our promise of assistance is conditional on your absention from unprovoked aggression. We will also, if you like, give you any assistance in our power for the development of your country, and all we have got to say is, let it be real friendship, just as ours will he real assistance. Don&apos;t embark on such negotiations again, without consulting us friendlily. You see what a mess you have landed yourselves in, which we think we could have saved you from if you had taken us into your confidence and been on friendly terms with us. It is not derogatory to consult those who are your friends, and you must be satisfied by now that we have no designs on your independence, and would give you advice in your interests.
By sucli means as these we get our treaty of friendship; we appear in the East as the protector of an independent Moslem State against aggression ; and although I would not for a moment make a treaty stipulation to that effect, we once again, by the -act of the Amir, get a position of influence, if not of authority, over Afghan foreign relations.It seems quite clear from what lias happened that the Amir begins to realise, if he had the courage to avow it, that we could help him more than the Bolsheviks. Why not promise him the assistance necessary ? Ourzon is in full agreement with this view. My reason for addressing you unofficially at this stage is that I do not want to go to Cabinet with a proposal that does not command your assent, and I want to explain to you the reason that underlies the answer that we have sent to your official telegram. When L have received the further official telegram that you promised, I will address you officially, but before that I hope to have your views on this sort of programme.   Does it not seem to you that we have a great opportunity ?From Viceroy, Foreign ami Political Department, IQth April 1921. Priority A.53S S. Secret. Afghanistan, Following from Dobbs, No. 87 C, dated 13th April:-&quot; We have had two private conferences during the past two days and have dealt with clauses 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 11 British Draft Treaty.&quot; Clause 3. Afghans again pressed for the alteration mentioned in my telegram of the 3rd April, 79 (&apos;? C). I hope to receive early orders on this question. They wish omission of fourth proviso as not being suitable for treaty, but they are willing to give official letter to the same effect.&quot; Clause I. Afghans pressed that we should either accept Consulates at Kandahar, Herat and Turkestan, giving them Cousulate(? s) at seaports as agreed, or if we wanted Consulates at three (? accessible) towns give them Consulate(? s) at Peshawar, Parachinar and Quetta. I refused latter, hut said we might partly fall in with their suggestion by substituting Herat for Ghazni.&quot; Clause 5 accepted, omitting reference to proviso in Article III. which had aroused their suspicion.&quot; Clause 7 accepted with omission of reference to Arms Traffic Convention, pending the decision oi His Majesty&apos;s Government. Afghans dislike the last sentence, which will be probably omitted. I explained we should have to take action indicated whether the sentence remained or not.&quot; Clause 11 accepted.&quot; Afghans again pressed for the inclusion of promise to amend Turkish Treaty. On my refusal, they asked for official letter in innocuous terms, affirming Great Britain&apos;s desire for the welfare and prosperity of Turkey and other Mahomedan States. I said that this might be agreed to.   Early orders on this point (? omission).&quot; Tarsi mooted question of Afghanistan entering League of Nations and asked for our good offices. Please inform me what the (? reply to the) move of Afghanistan should be.&quot; Discussion very friendly and Afghans tractable. We are to hold daily meetings and hope to get through all the clauses in a few days. Answers to questions, especially assurance regarding Russian aggression, are therefore urgently required.&quot;Our comments follow.From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 20th&apos;April 1921.Clear the line.551 S.   Secret.   Afghanistan.   Following from Dobbs : (1) No. 90 C, 15th April: &quot; During the past two days we have discussed clauses 7, 8, 9, 10, 1.2, 15, and schedule 2 of British draft.&quot; Clause 7. Question of Arms Traffic Convention has been referred. Regarding possible severance trade under the Covenant of League of Nations, it was agreed to omit mention from this clause, and add a fresh general clause to the effect that
nothing in the treaty shall override the obligations which may be incurred by either party under the Covenant or under Convention on Freedom of Transit. Last sentence of clause omitted at Afghan desire, as they said that it could be taken for granted.&quot; Clause S. Afghans asked for redraft of the second proviso to the effect that exemption from duty shall not apply to goods other than those required for the Afghan public services.   I agreed.&quot; Clause 9. Second proviso omitted in view of general clause already mentioned. This answers your telegram of the 11th April, 511 S.&quot; Clause 10.   Passed with the addition suggested by Government of India.&quot; Clause 12.   Passed.&quot; Clause 15.   Passed.&quot; I told Tarsi first that, apart from clause G, this clause would rule out tlie Eastern Consulates, as he had admitted they were directed against us ; secondly, it would rule out (? possible question of) offensive and defensive treaty with State likely to come into conflict with us, such as Anatolia. Tarsi replied that Afghanistan, in its relations with Anatolia, had certainly not reached stage to contemplate such a treaty.&quot;Schedule 2, sections A. to 1)., passed, with minor alterations suggested by Government of India. Section E. still under consideration. Afghans will probably accept amendment permitting either party to select and acquire or (? lease) necessary site or buildings. Sections F, (!, 11 passed. Section J. Number raised to 35 for Ministers and 20 for Consuls, both excluding families. Section J. Weight of free post raised to 0 lbs. for Ministers and 4 lbs. for Consulates weekly. Precise terms of telegraphic facilities still under discussion. Section K passed. Remaining clauses are to be discussed 16th April in the presence of Amir. At the end of the meeting Tarsi said Afghanistan was now doubtful whether she could make any treaty with Russia because she believed that they were not in earnest regarding grant of independence of Khiva and Bokhara, to which, especially latter, Afghanistan (? attaches) immense importance. He asked whether, in the event of rupture Russian negotiations over this question and of Russian aggression, British would support Afghanistan with money and arms. I replied that question was very delicate. Last thing we desired Avas that Afghanistan should fight Bolsheviks, and Khiva and Bokhara were completely beyond our sphere although we sympathise, with their desire for independence. What line should I take? It is difficult to say whether Afghan attitude has really changed owing to presence of Amir of Bokhara and Envoy, or whether Tarsi is only trying to involve us in a pledge of support.&quot;(2) No, 91 C. of 15th April :-&quot; It is now pretty certain that Amir of Bokhara is living at Paghman, and that Amir of Afghanistan is constantly visiting him. Muspratt and I accidentally came across two large Bokharan standards yesterday, in the midst of Paghman village, fixed into a raised platform, carefully watered and guarded by two Afghan soldiers as if sacred soil. It looks as if Afghans are still keeping open door for action in support, of Bokhara. I did not perhaps make it quite clear in my telegram immediately preceding that Tarsi definitely stated that Afghanistan would not dream of attacking Russia for the sake of Bokhara, but might (be) (two corrupt groups) refuse to make any kind of treaty with her, and hinted there would then be risings and trouble m CentrafAsia of which Afghanistan could ultimately take advantage. It was only in the event of Russia attacking Afghanistan on account of refusal to make a treaty that he desired assurance of help.&quot;(8) No. 92 C. of 17th April: &quot;We had seven hours&apos; conference with Amir, Tarsi. Muspratt left for India in the (? middle of the) conference. I am afraid that position is hopeless, and unless Amir accepts our controversial, clauses en bloc without further argument, we must leave. I am drafting telegrams reviewing the situation, which I may not be able to send to-day. Meanwhile, I hope it may be possible tO&apos; defer announcement of Mahsud policy until my arrival, so that it may not give Amir opportunity to pretend that he broke off negotiations in consequence of new policy.&quot;Dobbs has been told that announcement to Mahsucls is being held up, and that whole situation will be considered in. the light of his appreciation. Meanwhile, he has been instructed carefully to avoid committing himself to rupture of negotiations.
From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 20th April 1921.Clear the line.554 S, Secret. Afghanistan. Our telegram of the 20th April, 551 S. Dobbs&apos; appreciation of the situation is still awaited. But ups and downs at Kabul appear too sudden and violent to be altogether genuine. We were disposed to think Dobbs unduly optimistic over Afghans&apos; willingness to throw over Russian Treaty, in view of the importance they attach to securing treaty relations with both Russia and England. We are, therefore, the more encouraged to hope that he is unduly pessimistic over their latest attitude towards us.From Vieeroij, Foreign and Political Department, 2&apos;2nd April Y.Y2\.Clear the line.562 S. Following telegram lias been received from Dobbs, 91 C, dated 18th April: &quot;Seven hours&apos; conference with Amir yesterday, I produced Reuter&apos;sannounce-ment regarding Turkish Treaty. Amir swore there was no such treaty, and made the statements reported in my telegram No. 93 C. to Chief of the General Staff. 1 then said that British Government had obtained authentic information that the Russo-Afghau Treaty contained secret clause promising arms to Afghanistan. Amir said that this might be so, but neither he nor Surits would know exactly what was in treaty before Rosenberg^ arrival. I said, with all these secret treaties and clauses, and demands for secret writings, British Government did not know where they stood. We were laying all our cards on the table and he must do same; otherwise I could not reassure British Government about the situation. There might be many other secret clauses. Amir said that we should be satisfied by his pledge in the (? draft &apos;? Afghan) treaty that he would enter into no engagement directed against us. I said that we were best judges of what was directed against us, and could not leave decision to him, and cited (&apos;? the) instance of Habibulla&apos;s opposition to Afghan clauses of the Anglo-Russian Convention, 1897, which we had never dreamed could be opposed to Afghan interests, as showing that one State could not judge of political requirements of another. I insisted that, if we reached agreement regarding draft treaty, all agreements, secret or otherwise, concluded or contemplated, between Afghanistan and other Powers should be communicated before signature of our treaty. Regarding secret assurance from us, we were, I thought, precluded by covenant of League of Nations, and I thought it probable that, even if British Government consented to give an assurance of help in the event of Russian aggression, they would insist that it must be general assurance against unprovoked aggression by any other Power,&apos;and must be published as a part of regular treaty. Amir said this would be useless. He would not have such an assurance published, and it must be secret. Otherwise it would destroy his reputation with other Powers and Moslem peoples. He seemed quite impracticable on this point. I made it clear that I had not received any hint of attitude of the British Government in the matter.&quot; We then considered controversial clauses in my draft treaty.&quot; Clause 2. Amir said that Afghan honour made the retention of Arnawai necessary, as Chitral had invaded Afghanistan after the armistice. I refused to consider the question, and he said it had no importance, and yielded. He then asked&apos; that boundary between Shilman mouth and Palosa should be shifted from, mid-stream to the right bank, so as to include whole of that (? portion of the) Kabul river within Afghanistan, as otherwise there would be trouble about jurisdiction over rafts and merchandise, &amp;c. I promised to consider this if the rights of our tribesmen and officers to use the river were guaranteed. He then asked for undertaking not to fortify Tandy Sar. Heated discussion followed, and Amir finally said he would.. withdraw request if rest of treaty satisfied him.&quot; Clause 13, regarding tribes, was discussed for above five hours. Amir agreed to clause as it stands, but insisted on addition of a mutual promise of amnesty to the tribesmen who (? omission) during the war against British or Afghans respectively, in respect of unpaid fmes or rifles. Amir maintained he was bound in honour to intervene on behalf of tribesmen who helped him during the Avar, that intercession of. one friend with another on behalf of third party was recognised frontier custom,.
honourable both for intercessor and for injured party who forgave injuries, and that unless he obtained amnesty for the tribesmen his reputation was gone. He said he knew we had recovered bulk of iine and rifles, and concessions would be merely nominal. If we could not make it, he would know we did not desire his friendship. -Fines for private torts and injuries, such as murder of Colonel and Mrs. (corrupt group), plunder of Hindus&apos; shops, &amp;c, would be excluded ; but he must ask for amnesty for all offences by Afridis, Madsuds and Waziris against Government as distinct from private persons from the beginning of Afghan war up to the present time. He would undertake the responsibility formally never to intercede again for the tribes, and in future to use his influence with them in our favour. 1 used all usual and obvious arguments, and said it was barely possible that British Government might consider mutual promise of amnesty for acts committed during the war, but not for acts committed afterwards. I did not, however, think even this would be * accepted. Amir persisted that an amnesty would be futile, unless it covered all acts up to the present. He also asked for letters permitting him to continue to give Khilats and allowances to our tribes, as former Amirs had done, i refused, and Amir did not seem (? injured). He said also there should be promise of future good treatment which would mean that our troops should evacuate tribal territory. 1 said we had decided to retain troops indefinitely, and such a promise was impossible. Amir appeared to yield on this point.&quot; Exhaustion finally brought conference to end. Amir said he hoped Tarsi and I would be able to evolve some formula satisfying both sides, but he could not give up request for amnesty. Amir seemed profoundly disappointed and to dread a rupture, hut I do not believe he will abandon this request. He would apparently accept addition to clause \&apos;a on the following lines :  (I.F.O.C.C. 1906) :-&quot;Further, Government of Great Britain agrees, as a sign of its friendship for Afghanistan, and at the intercession of Amir of Afghanistan, to remit in favour of those tribes, i.e., Afridis, Mahsuds, and Wazirs who rose against Great Britain during the recent regrettable war between the two High Contracting Parties, the balance of fines and rifles demanded from them on account of offences committed by them between the commencement of said war and the date of signature of this treaty, which may be outstanding on the date of ratification of this treaty ; and likewise the Government of Afghanistan agrees, as a sign of its friendship for Great Britain, and at the inter-cession of the British Government, to remit in favour of any tribesmen who may have risen against Afghanistan during the same war, the balance of any fines and rifles demanded from them on account of offences committed by them during the aforesaid period, which may be* outstanding on the date of ratification of this treaty. (? Frequent cases of) (?offences against) persons or private property shall not, however, be included in foregoing act of amnesty, which shall apply only to offences against either Government, or against troops and property of either Government.&quot; Lastly, the two High Contracting Powers mutually undertake, each with regard to the tribesmen living within the boundaries of the other, that they will not in future make such intercession on behalf of offenders, and that each will discourage tribesmen living within the boundaries of the other from making appeals for such intercession.&quot;(End of I.F.O.C.C., 1906.)No. 95 C, 18th April :-&quot;If Amir&apos;s request for mutual amnesty stood alone, I should recommend its acceptance in the interests of peace, although opinion of North-West Frontier Province might well be against it.   But I cannot disguise from myself that this continuous Afghan double dealing, their grasping (two corrupt groups) secret assurance,.,, and (corrupt group) from all quarters, and thick atmosphere of intrigue, makes it impossible to place faith in Afghanistan in her present mood.   I have little doubt that Afghanistan is now trying to get Russia to give secret assurance of support against British in the event of the latter attacking her over the Consulates question.. Afghanistan is trying to drive at least six teams abreast, namely, Bolsheviks, British,. Kamalists, followers of Jamal, revolutionary Bokkarans, and Amir of Bokhara, and hopes to yoke up Persia also, her object being to get arms and technical advisers from all quarters and to keep open the road for future domination in Central Asia.   Unless she can be brought to see the folly of this (group apparently omitted), her political affections, she is bound to come to grief and drag into discredit all parties involved -with her.   Kabul is being daily flooded more and more with Turkish officers and
*     From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department,2m April 1921.Clear the line.509 S,   Secret.   Afghanistan.   Following from Dobbs : -1. No. 97 0 of 21st April :-&quot; Your telegram of the 19th April, 550 S. Obviously Afghanistan would like to stick to her splendid new policy of drawing profit from both sides. Question seems to be not whether she wishes to abandon that policy, and make choice between us and Russia, but whether our action has not forced her to do so. Your argument ignores what, in my view, and I believe, in Afghan view, is governing factor, namely, that the publication to the whole world of clause in the Uusso-Afghan agreement establishing the Eastern Consulates, and of Homes peremptory demand that they shall not be established, make it now almost impossible for Russia to withdraw without admitting (? severe) diplomatic defeat. Tarsi commented to me during lunch at Foreign Office on the 16th instant, on the extraordinary methods of the new diplomacy, which, he said, consists of making demands from your rival and, by simultaneously pubfishing your demands, making it difficult for him to comply. True, if our demands had been kept secret Russia might conceivably have sacrificed consulates to British and Afghan pressure; but it has now become a public trial of strength between us and Russia, and I agree with the Afghans in thinking it very unlikely that Russia will give way. In any case, elimination of consulate(?s omitted) now would so delay conclusion of Russian treaty as greatly to (? counter) its value in Afghan eyes.u Russia and Afghanistan, on their part expect, I believe, that we will yield up (sic), and most dangerous situation possible in diplomacy now threatens to arise, namely, that each side should mistakenly believe the other to be mdleable. Reluctance of His Majesty&apos;s Government, as evinced in the Secretary of State&apos;s telegram, to bring pressure to bear from their side, will, when known, confirm Afghans in this view.&quot;I think it is probable that Amir anticipated that we should refuse assurance of help against Russian aggression, and that he made the request mainly for dialecticBolsheviks. Treaty with us will not get rid of these, hut they are already unpopular (with omitted; army and people. If we give them rope to hang themselves they will do so eventually. Unless therefore we can increase our offer sufficiently to induce her to abandon her attempt to get advantages from other quarters, and can guarantee her against consequent possible aggression, it would be best for us to stand aside until the catastrophe occurs. I understand increase in our offer is out of the question. I think, therefore, that I should now inform Amir that, unless he accepts clauses 2, 6, 13, 14 and 16 of my draft treaty as they stand, with any (? formal) and public assurance against aggression by third Power which Bis Majesty&apos;s Government may be prepared to give, and unless he discloses all agreements and understandings, whether secret or not, with other Powers, which he may have concluded or be at present (? contemplating), I am instructed to break off negotiations and leave. If this were approved, I would, in the event of refusal, formally review proceedings at official meeting, and deliver request for evacuation of Arnawai, but would not fix time limit for the latter nor make [? definite threat) in the event of non-compliance. My reason for this suggested (? change) is that I think Afghan opinion is much more likely to veer in our favour if we stand aloof as disgusted friends rathe]1 than the threatening enemy. Afghanistan is not likely to risk complications during the current year with a discontented Army and severe famine along whole Eastern border. Lack of fodder, transport would alone make war almost impossible. I hope I may receive early intimation views of Government of India.&quot;I send you Pobbs&apos; appreciation as received, but I am in further communication with him, for his change in attitude is so remarkable that I want to be quite clear that his appreciation represents his final views, and that there is no addition or modification he wishes to make in light of your latest telegrams or subsequent developments at Kabul. These telegrams are of such importance that, if Dobbs&apos; views remain unaltered, the whole position will have to be carefully considered with you. Please take no action until you hear further from me.
purposes, to put us in a difficulty, and to test strength of our objection to consulate. But that is all the more reason why we should give him the assurance(s), in order to deprive him of (? dialectic advantage, and convince him we are in earnest.&quot; I adhere to opinion expressed in my telegram of the 27th February, 53 C, that Afghanistan, if forced to rely exclusively on either Russia or Great Britain, would probably prefer Russia ; hut that opinion was based on the assumption that our oiler to Afghanistan could in no case be increased, and that she; would have to choose between two approximately equal subsidies and other advantages. I have never believed that if we could increase our offer sufficiently and outbid Russia we could not win Afghanistan completely to our side. She is now in such need of money, and the discontent of the army is so serious, that she would possibly, for immediate adequate sum and promise of arms in the event of Russian aggression, sacrifice to some extent her power of independent action, forego her tribal pretentious, and break with the Turkish Nationalists and Russia sufficiently for our purpose, &apos;f arsi&apos;s statement at Mussoorie that obligations of hospitality to Indian revolutionaries might (?be omitted) overlooked if we offered enough, his recent saying, &quot; Let us have Jess tact and more money,&quot; and his expression about the clean broach with the Russians, all points in same direction. Question then arises what guarantee we should have, first, against Afghans using our (? increased) bid to make Russians raise theirs ; and, secondly, against further communication (sic) intrigues. Against first we have the fact that Afghans cannot afford to wait. Renewed negotiations with Russia would take too long a time. Against secoad we have no guarantee except Afghan dependence on our subsidy ; hut this, with the present value attached by Afghanistan to her good faith, should perhaps suffice.&quot;I do not think that we could now get Afghanistan to forego Soviet Treaty for less than one crore of rupees down, and annual sum of 40 lakhs of rupees, with a promise, in the event of serious threat of Russian aggression, of, say, 0,000.rifles with ample ammunition, 21 modern machine-guns with ammunition, and six aeroplanes, and also undertaking to train some Afghans beforehand in flying. Afghans are so excited by the idea of aeroplanes promised by Russia, that I doubt whether we should not have (? to omitted) promise some aeroplanes in any case.It is for Government of India to consider whether it is better worth while to attempt this or to rupture our negotiations. We should have to stipulate that, our treaty, as at present drafted, be accepted, with an additional clause thtlt Afghanistan shall suspend negotiations with other parties, and consult us before making agreement with any other party. They should also give an unofficial pledge to expel Indian revolutionaries. It must be remembered that Rs. 40,00,000 now is worth only Rs. 20.00,000 before the war, that under the Russian treaty, Afghanistan believes she is to recover Panjdeh, to receive subsidy of equivalent of about Rs. 18,00,000, and also large quantities of arms and some aeroplanes, given, I believe, unconditionally and not only in event of aggression by us. Nature of secret Soviet agreement regarding arms is contained in documents mentioned in separate telegram to Chief of the General Staff, last document quoted mentions arrangement for despatch of rifles, guns, and aeroplanes to be given under the treaty, and first seems to show that portion of arms asked for under JamaFs scheme is to be supplied annually. If any such change in our proposals is to be made, it must be done without delay. Amir can hardly postpone ratification of the treaty with Russia for long after it reaches him, and Rosenburg may arrive any day, if not already here.&quot;2. No. 103 C. of 24th April:-&quot; I have perhaps not made it clear to (? Government of India) that, even if they decide to make step towards meeting Amir&apos;s views regarding amnesty to the tribes, it will be useless for me to resume discussions unless I can first record (of) clear reply to Afghan enquiries (1) whether we will make a contingent promise of help against Russian aggression ; and (2) whether we will give more money in the event of partial or complete withdrawal of Russian offer oil cession of Punjdeh, subsidy, &amp;c, supposing one or other of these follows on Afghan Eastern Consulates. Recent discussion of clauses, other than clause 6, was made clearly provisory pending my reply regarding these assurances, and no indefinite reply will satisfy Afghans. Probable course of events will be (a) as follows :-Rosenburg, who crossed the frontier at Kushk, 31st March, will, as announced to-day in a Kabul paper, arrive with final Russian Treaty possibly by the (?26th April) and (?Suritz) will then request Amir to ratify. Amir will inform me that he cannot wait indefinitely and will possibly fix period within which, if he gets no reply from us regarding requested assurance, he must ratify Russian Treaty, including Eastern Consulates.  I do not see how, in view
of recent course of events, we can avoid assurances if we want Treaty. We cannot wait for Russian reply to Horne&apos;s demands (? because) she will almost certainly not reply until she knows what course Afghans will take regarding Treaty, and especially regarding Eastern Consulates. So we must deal with this point before we know whether Russia will yield or not ; if we have to give assurances and make increased offer, surely it would be best to go as far as passible towards securing quid pro quo demanded by Grant at Rawalpindi, Please see record of third meeting of 31st duly 1919. Grant definitely announced a3 conditions for Friendship Treaty, informal arrangements whereby we should advise on Afghan Foreign Affairs, dismissal of all hostile foreigners, especially Bolshevik Missions and Agents, and dismissal of Indian seditionists. At the same meeting, Afghan representative definitely stated that if British would help Afghanistan and provide money, guns, rifles and engineers against tho Bolsheviks, latter would be warned olf Afghanistan. This was the programme originally accepted by Government of India, and though we moved some way from it at Mussoorie Conference, question of Consulate seems, as J have already explained, to have forced us back to it, and His Majesty&apos;s Government seems ready to take this line.&quot;We could not now suggest even informal control of foreign affairs; but a mutual promise not to make without consultation agreement affecting mutual interests with third Power is frequently made between two independent Stales, and could probably be made acceptable to Afghanistan. We could not now well demand dismissal of Bolshevik Minister at Kabul, but we could ask for strict limitation of official or unofficial representatives and could possibly secure informally, polite termination of JamaPs services.&quot;From Viceroij, Foreign and Political Dapartme.nl, mh April 1921.Priority A.590 S. Dobbs asks that you may be informed that (corrupt group) received your 2028 of 15th April when ho sent his 95 C. of 18th April.From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 21th April 1921.Clear the line.Secret. Afghanistan. Afghau problem has become so complicated that-it is as well to summarise essential facts and factors.(1) Russia wants a treaty with Afghanistan to secure her position with her Moslems on Afghan border and to threaten our position in India.(2) Afghanistan wants a treaty with both Russia and ourselves to draw advantages from each for the consolidation of her finances and general iuternal condition and to escape being dominated by either.(3) We want a treaty with Afghanistan to prevent Russia dominating her and to secure peace on. the frontier.(4) Frontier is unsettled partly as the aftermath of the Afghan War, partly because of lack of a settlement between Afghanistan and ourselves, partly because of Afghanistan exercising her influence against us in order to force us to settlement, and partly, as we believe, owing to Bolshevik intrigues.There are now three policies for us to choose from : (a) to offer Afghanistan sufficient inducement in money and arms and assurances to make her throw over Bolshevik treaty ; (6) to make Amir a last final offer of our draft treaty as it stands, plus a public and formal assurance against aggression by a third Power, coupled with demand for the disclosure of all treaties formed or contemplated ; (c) to continue to try to modify our treaty in unessentials so as to make it acceptable to Amir, insisting on exclusion of Eastern Consulates and on the disclosure of Bolshevik treaty, and giving him (? supplementary) assurances in the form of a letter regarding support in the event of Russian aggression.Wei nave carefully considered policy (a) in the light of your telegram of 15th April, 2028. and Dobbs&apos; recommendations. Were it possible to make a clean sweep 3926 C
inof the Bolshevik treaty and Bolshevik influence from Afghanistan, wo should be prepared to go to considerable lengths in money and arms to secure it. But we believe this to be impossible. In whatever form our oiler was couched, it would be in effect reversion towards our old control of Afghanistan^ foreign relations and would be so regarded. Dobbs himself contemplates clause under which Afghanistan woidd undertake to suspend negotiations with other parties and consult us before making any agreements with them. We believe it would be impossible for the Amir, who came to the throne as the champion of Afghanistan&apos;s independence and has proclaimed it in all his public utterances, to accept this clause or anything like it. Even if we raised our offer to an irresistible height and found formula which would exclude Russian and Turkish treaties without (? o(Tending) Afghans&apos; susceptibilities, we do not believe that Amir would exclude the Bolsheviks or Turks from Afghanistan or refrain from working underground for secret engagements with both.Mere making of the offer would be daugerous. It would place Amir in favourite oriental role of auctioneer with Russia and England bidding for Afghanistan as the prize. If negotiations are to proceed along existing lines, in the event of Amir refusing our ofTer(s), they woidd be seriously prejudiced. Wo are therefore led reluctantly to conclusion that policy (tt) must be abandoned.Dobbs&apos; alternative is policy (Vi, and he anticipates rupture of negotiations as the result.   Much though we sympathise with Dobbs over the trying problem that confronts him, we find it difficult to see what new factor has arisen suddenly to force him to abandon policy he has been hitherto pursuing beyond His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment&apos;s unexpected decision not to put pressure on Russians in connection with their published note to Krassin.   If his general appreciation of situation is correct we have been on the wrong tact (? tack) from the beginning.   Indeed, from his latest reasoning it, might be argued that it would be unwise to conclude a treaty with Amir upon any terms,   lie seems also to attach too little weight to one cardinal feature of the case  that of our frontier tribes.   There is no getting over the fact that Amir can unsettle them whenever he likes, and by expending comparatively small sums among them land us in an expenditure of crores and loss of life.   We are faced with this fact now. Organised opposition of Wazirs ami Alahsuds would have broken down long ago, but for the presence among them of his unavowed emissaries with doles of money, and munitions.   As we said in our telegram of 15th March, 3725, rupture with Afghanistan would mean immediate embarrassment of serious character on the frontier which might easily develop into a frontier trouble of first-class magnitude, and even into an Afghan War, declared not by Amir, but, however much against our will, by ourselves. This is a prospect4 which, in existing circumstances, we are most reluctant to face, and we therefore advise that policy (6) bo discarded.In our opinion, we should still proceed with policy (c).   Wre believe that treaty with us is so essential to Amir, for political and financial reasons, that he will not break with us except in last resort.   We know that he was at pains to eliminate anti-British clauses from the Soviet treaty.    Eastern Consulates are only remaining elements in treaty palpably anti-British.   We believe that if wo tell Amir flatly that he must expunge them, he will take steps to do so, and that in this event Russia will accept position, still maintaining treaty in order to retain her Legation in Kabul, and foothold in Afghanistan.   But, in this connection, we earnestly hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government will see their way to press Russia to comply with conditions His Majesty&apos;s Government have imposed regarding these Consulates.   We agree with Dobbs that Russia will probably cut down her concessions and that delay in negotiating a fresh treaty will hit Afghanistan hardly.   We therefore agree that assurance against Russian aggression should be given Amir, not as secret clause, but in a supplementary letter.   We do not believe that Amir would publish this (? as he is) evidently feeling strongly that the public acceptance of such an assurance from us would have appearance of impairing Afghanistan independence.   His request for an assurance that we should make good any reductions Russia may make in her concessions cannot be entertained.   It is impossible for us to undertake an indefinite liability of this kind.   Bat we think that Dobbs should be authorised to raise subsidy, if necessary to 25 lakhs, or even 30 lakhs, in order to cover any whittling down of the Russian concessions in consequence of our treaty.The attitude still maintained by the Amir over the tribes- is awkward. Dobbs believes that he will not abandon request lie has made. On the other hand it is out of the question to grant it. Yet we believe further negotiations may enable Dobbs to devise some formula which, while saving Amir&apos;s face, will not be derogatory to our prestige on the frontier.   Such a formula would not, of course, form part of
treaty, but would be given (if the Amir signed treaty) in the form of a personal letter to Amir as an act of grace and to mark beginning of a new era of friendship and peace on the conclusion of a treaty of friendship. It may be said that any concession on this point would increase AmiYs influence over the tribes. There is ground for thinking this would not be, for such face-saving formula as we may be prepared to give would fall far short of lavish promises which the Amir has given tribes from time to time. But in any case, Amir&apos;s influence over the tribes exists and we cannot shut our eyes to it. With a treaty the inducement of the subsidy should restrain him from exercising that influence adversely. Without a treaty it will be inevitably hostile.So far I have spoken on behalf of myself and my Council. I now desire to add a few remarks personal to myself. I came to this Afghan problem fresh and unfettered by any association with the (? events) and discussions that have led up to it. Any bias I may have had was a natural bias toward a summary method of dealing with this petty State on our border. My searching conversation with those concerned with the various aspects of the problem, and my own independent study of it in its political, military and financial ramifications, have left me with firm conviction that in existing conditions a rupture with Afghanistan would be most regrettable, and that we should stick to the negotiations so long as there is any prospect of their culminating in a settlement.The question has not only an external but an internal aspect. . The latest developments in regard to the Turkish Treaty may deprive Khilafat agitation of much of its force, Out there is a considerable section of Indian Muslims to whom Khilafat is only an excuse for promoting discontent against Government, and this section derives much of its strength from its pretension that the disaffected Indian Muslims can look for help from Amir. A treaty with Afghanistan would definitely explode those pretentious and greatly facilitate our task in dealing with unrest (in) agitation. Moreover, from my discussions with military authorities and most experienced Members of Council and advisers, next two months are most critical and most likely to lead to disturbances. Internal situation may at any moment become more serious during these next two months, and I am most anxious that we should not have an Afghan rupture at this moment if it can be avoided. The external and internal situations react on each other. When you discuss question with your colleagues, I beg that you will explain strong reasons I have for wishing to continue negotiations as &quot;long as we can without placing ourselves in undignified position.From Secretary of Stale to Viceroy, Foreign Department,mh April 1921.Clear the line.2235.   Secret.   Your telegram dated 27th April.   Afghanistan.I have very carefully considered and discussed with those of my colleagues who were available the series of telegrams ending with yours of 27th April. Fact that you have brought to consideration of problem in India full knowledge of views of His Majesty&apos;s Government derived from deliberations in London in which you took part lends special weight to your views, and leads us to wish to leave you the fullest discretion in these negotiations.The policy of attempting to buy the Bolsheviks out altogether has been fully put before you. In my opinion it would, if successful, be the best and indeed the only final solution, since it appears to me that, so Jong as Bolsheviks retain in Afghanistan footing which treaty relations will give them, Afghan treaty with us will be of very little value, whatever paper safeguards it may contain. I should therefore be quite prepared to agree to any offer of money and arms, and assurances of support, which Government of India would be prepared to give to secure complete break with Bolsheviks and the&apos;&apos;quid pro quo mentioned in Dobbs&apos; telegram No. 103 0. of 24th April.Of the alternatives policy (b) has the disadvantage of involving the risk of immediate rupture with Afghanistan, whereas you are anxious, for reasons with which I sympathise, cormected with frontier and internal situation, to tide Over at least the next two months. I agree that it is very desirable that negotiations should be &quot;kept in being as long as possible, and if policy (c), which you now recommend, were limited to that purpose, I should have nothing more to say. But it is apparently &apos;    3926   &apos; D
From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, bth May 1921.    .Clear the line.032 S. Secret. Your telegram of the 29th April, 2235. Afghanistan. I am glad that you are at one with me that we should not run the risk of precipitating rupture with Afghanistan.But I want a settlement at present with Afghanistan, even though we cannot get it on terms we should like. It is in my opinion undesirable that we should come away without a treaty, with probability of serious external and internal consequences and prospect of Afghanistan securing treaty relations of sorts with all important Powers but ourselves. If Russia, on being deprived of Eastern Consulates, declines to pay any subsidy or give any arms, so much the better. If, however, she still thinks it worth while to continue these concessions, whether reduced or in full, then I am convinced, viewing the whole situation both externally and internally, that we should not forego settlement with Afghanistan on that account. I share your repugnance to our entering into such a treaty with knowledge that simultaneously Afghanistan is grasping the hands (and the money) of Russia. I still hold views I expressed in Cabinet, but my present more intimate knowledge of Indian affairs makes me desirous to obtain treaty with Afghanistan, even though it falls short of our requirements. Subject to my observations made later herein, I therefore recom-mencl that Dobbs should proceed with negotiations on the existing lines on distinct understanding that if we cannot secure anything better we shall make a treaty with Afghanistan concurrent with a Russo-Afghan treaty under which Afghanistan may, and probably will, receive a subsidy and arms from the Soviets. I think that it is necessary we should now arrive at definite conclusion, and instruct Dobbs accordingly.I recognise the unpleasant prospects that confront us with Bolsheviks retaining their foothold in Afghanistan, but I feel that there is now no room for counsel of perfection in regard to Afghanistan.   Moreover, I cannot but think that His Majesty&apos;^.-Government by their trade agreement have to some extent shifted centre of gravity-in this matter from India and Kabul to London and Moscow, and that sterilising ofintended to lead to the conclusion of a treaty, and may in fact do so, and from this point of view, surely, it is open to the objections which His Majesty&apos;s Government, as you know, felt to an arrangement which leaves the Amir free to receive money and arms from the Bolsheviks and military assistance from the Turks. You do not explicitly deal with this point, and I am not altogether clear whether &quot;whittling down of Russian concessions in consequence of our treaty&quot; which you contemplate, refers to subsidy and arms or only to cession of Penjdeh mentioned in Dobbs&apos; 103 C. If the latter, then while the Cabinet will, I am sure, desire to give you all possible assistance in dealing with the many difficulties with which you are faced, you, who were present when this question was discussed, will realise that they will ask whether policy (e) will not end by placing us in exactly the position which we so strongly deprecate, and they will want to have your answer to that question before authorising you to proceed.Their hesitation will bo increased by what is known of Bolshevik attitude. Text of Chicherin&apos;s reply to Horne&apos;s note is given in my immediately following telegram. It should be read in the light of very secret Constantinople report of 13th April on proceedings of Meeting of Council of Action and Propaganda at Baku on 25th February, copy of which has been sent to Chief of the General Staff from Constantinople. At this meeting Chicherin&apos;s representative stated that Soviet would never abandon its campaign against us in the Fast, but that if trade agreement were signed &quot; we shall have to work in greater secrecy, which means that we shall be compelled to utilise to a greater extent local elements .... Our Eastern policy is our weapon in our endeavour to crush England, and we cannot possibly afford to discard that weapon, even should we sign treaty with England, as if we should discard it no treaty would be anything more than a useless scrap of paper.&quot; In respect to your request, His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided to press Soviet Government for abandonment of Eastern Consulates, while not feeling sanguine that this is likely to achieve very satisfactory results.
Bolshevik machinations in Afghanistan will in some degree depend on importance attached both by Russia and His Majesty&apos;s Government to the maintenance of trade relations with Russia. Hence, I am grateful to His Majesty&apos;s Government for the attitude they are adopting towards Eastern Consulates in answer to our request. At the same time, I feel once we anchor Amir to us with a subsidy under a treaty which does not violate Anhr&apos;s national self-respect, his own self-interest would induce him to keep Bolshevik intrigue in check. He will soon realise, if he does not already, that India with her superior and more accessible markets, her financial stability and integrity, with the resources of the British Empire behind her, her geographical position as the winter (sic) (? affects) a considerable portion of Afghan race, (?is not) only the more reliable but the more profitable partner.Nevertheless, the considerations that weigh with His Majesty&apos;s Government have weighed also with me.   J recognise that if we could make a clean sweep of the Bolshevik Treaty and of Bolshevik influence from Afghanistan, it would be a serious check for the Bolsheviks and a valuable diplomatic triumph which, if not lasting, might possibly outlast the Soviet regime ami possibility (sic) (? possibly) the disturbed internal condition of India.   But it is essential to get a clear-cut idea what it is possible for us to buy.   You speak of &quot; buying Bolsheviks out altogether&quot; and of &quot; a complete break with the Bolsheviks.&quot;   But even Dobbs (vide his telegram 103 C. of 24th April) does not contemplate removal of Bolshevik Minister from Kabul or of Bolshevik official and unofficial representatives from Afghanistan, though he thinks we might secure a restriction of their number.   If, then, all we can secure is a disappearance of the Soviet subsidy (? large part of) arms and some restriction of number of Soviet representatives in Afghanistan, is this worth sacrifice of money and arms and other concessions (and the Amir would almost certainly press hard for considerable tribal concessions) we should have to make to obtain it?   I confess myself doubtful as to possibility of Amir entertaining any such proposals.   In my telegram of the 27th April last on Afghanistan, the grounds for this doubt are stated in paragraph beginning policy ((f).   Assuming Amir&apos;s willingness, we then consider whether he would in fact perform the treaty.   The advantage of treaty would (?be omitted) that it would look like a diplomatic triumph and would have immediate effect on frontier activities and Indian internal condition.   But it might soon prove a very empty victory with a Soviet (? Minister at) Kabul re undermine it and the temptation to Amir to receive from Russia both money and arms.Moreover, the very essence of modern Afghan policy is to demonstrate to the -world that Afghanistan is free to negotiate with, any nation she chooses, in whatever way she chooses, and to grant or deny admittance to foreigners at her pleasure. This is not merely the Amir&apos;s policy but the national policy, for the spirit of nationalism in Afghanistan has been aroused over this point. Hence, even, though a glittering-bait might tempt Amir at a time of unexampled financial stringency to accept for the moment our fetters, his relations with Russia, public, opinion, and Russian and Turkish intrigues might force him to evade his engagements (e.g., by accepting the Bolshevik subsidy and arms under the guise of commercial loans or trade transactions), (? &quot;and &quot; omitted) we should be compelled either to pay for the undelivered goods, or to stop the subsidy and provoke an open breach. On the other hand, Amir would not wish to lose his subsidy from us, and Russian activities could scarcely be as effective when carried on in breach of treaty as when pursued openly and in accordance with Russo-Afghan treaty.My conclusion is that I agree with His Majesty&apos;s Government that, if it be reasonably possible it would be better to make a treaty which excludes Russian treaty with the subsidy and gift of arms. I am profoundly conscious of risk we should run of evasion of such a treaty by Amir, if he made it. But it seems to me that the&apos;risks are worth taking for the sake of peace on the frontier, and the effect on Indian-internal conditions, if only (? five corrupt groups) the Amir will make it.My recommendation, after giving full effect and long consideration to your views, is that Dobbs should be instructed that we should prefer exclusive treaty, and that he should bear this well in mind whilst conducting negotiations, and that if he could obtain rt, we would be prepared to run the risk of Amir evading or breaking it after a year or two. He would, of course, have to proceed with utmost caution. He might perhaps be able to manoeuvre Amir or Tarsi at some particularly difficult stage in private negotiations to repeat hint of possible break with Russia over Bokhara. Dobbs might then blurt out that if hint is meant seriously, Amir should come out in open with definite proposals, as it would put completely different complexion on -negotiations.   If Amir responded, Dobbs, while encouraging him to put all his cards
on table, should, of course, commit himself to nothing, and simply say that he woidd report matter to us for consideration. I cannot but think that he would he in better position to negotiate if he knew definitely view of His Majesty&apos;s Government.I am, however, particularly desirous of impressing upon you and your colleagues, that it would be better in my judgment to have a treaty which does not please us, than to have none at all. I am impressed also by rapidly mounting cost of frontier activities, which will soon surpass amount provided for them in Budget if they continue many months more.I have tried to give you full exposition of my views, and trust that His Majesty&apos;s Government will find it possible to agree to course I propose, after the fullest investigation.
