PART II

GENERAL INTELLIGENCE.

EGYPT

There has been a disturbance at Tanta, which originated in the Mosque where speakers supporting Adly and Zaghloul respectively, quarrelled; the row was continued in the street, necessitating the intervention of the police, and there were casualties amounting to four killed and sixty wounded.

Lord Allenby considers the general situation in Egypt dangerous and has requested that the troops should be re-inforced, and this is being done.

PALESTINE.

There has been fighting between the Jews and Arabs in Jaffa; it is believed that about 100 were killed, the casualties being fairly evenly divided between Mohammedans and the Jews.

Martial law was declared in Jaffa and the situation is now quiet and shops have re-opened, but the attitude of the Jews is provocative and they have been distributing arms, wherewith to attack tho Arabs, though this has not been carried out on a large scale.

PERSIA.

No firing or fighting between the Soviet and Persian troops in Gilan has taken place since 18th April, Civilian traffic is permitted to take place between Resht and Menjil, both sides having examining posts.

RUSSIA.

Ukraine.

Unrest in the Ukraine still continues. Practically every district of importance has its own insurgent band and Chief. The revolutionary movement tends to coalesce into a uniform movement and the general position of the Bolsheviks is far from secure. In the Kiev district, Ataman Strouk is the new leader; he is endeavouring to enlist the support of the Jews, who are developing a tendency to abandon the Bolsheviks. Makhno, repeatedly reported dead or to have surrendered, is apparently still active in the Southern districts.

Trans-Caspia.

Heavy Bolshevik recruiting is taking place between Merv and Askabad and everyone, regardless of nationality, is taken. The Bolsheviks are concentrating at Merv and Charjui against the ex-Khan of Khiva. An unconfirmed report states that a Jehad against the Bolsheviks will shortly be called for amongst all Mohammedans in Central Asia.
GERMANY. \ 3 \7.1i3 1erms of the ultimatum to Germany as regards disarmament, trial of war criminals and reparations. have appeared in detail in the press.     The Cabinet have resign-od, hut are carrying on until a new Cabinet is Oornod.   It is intended to leave the answer to the Ultimatum to thenew CabinetiUpoer Silesia.The reports from Upper Silesia are littlo re-assuring.   After strongly op -ooing tho re-call of the Polish Plebiscite Commissioner uorfanty, the Polish Government have now dismissed him and closed the frontier.   It appears that at this late hour the Polish Government are beginning to realise how their cause is being prejudiced by their &quot;laisser fairc&quot; attitude.     The Germans, who have con- , ducted themselves with constraint up to the present, are now demanding remission to send Reiohswohr troops to Silesia, and also that British troops should be sent back there.The disturbed position in Upper Silesia is strengthening tho hands of the re-actionary parties in Germany in their efforts to resist the acceptance of the Ultimatum by tho Allied Council.The plebiscite Commission has recruited somo 3,000 Germans for police purposes.RUMANIA.A corniercial, and also a defensive, convention, on tho linos of the Ozecho Slovak treaty with Jugo-Slavia, was signed by the Czeeho Slovakia^ Minister, and the Rumanian Minister for Foreign Affairs, on 23rd April.At the same time the contracting parties signed, a protocol to the following effect :-&quot;Th*o military convention referred to in Article 2 is to remain secret, and will contain a provision to the effect that, should Rumania bo engaged in a war with any other Power, Czecho Slovakia will not prevent her from procuring materiel in Ozecho Slovakia, or from transporting it through Ozecho Slovakia^ territory.11TURK R Y.Approval has been given for British liaison Officers to be attached to the Turkish Nationalist forces This approval ia conditional on tho production of satis-factory guarantees for the safety of the Officers, and the previous release of British prisoners &quot;of war.P A N A U A.The U.S. Government has forwarded a very strong Note to the Panamanian Government on tho question of the territorial dispute with Costa Rica.   The Note states that the    hite   boundary line must be respected, and unless the disputed territory is handed over to Costa Rica within a reasonable time &quot;the Government of the United States will be compelled to proceed in a manner to assure itself that tho exercise of jurisdiction is appro-appropriately transferred and that the Pacific boundary as defined by President Loubet and that the Atlantic boundary as deter-mined by Chief Justice White is specifically laid down&quot;.
