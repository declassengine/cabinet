Referred to Committee of Home AffairsjLtnm ha f-Ul4PHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HB BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S. GOVERNMENT. SECRET. CABINET.ii&apos;I toll &apos;NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE. ADMINISTRATION EXPENSES.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF HEALTH.I desire permission at once to introduce a one page Bill making certain re-adjustments in the Finance of National Health Insurance in order to set free a little more monoy for the costIof administration by Approved Societies and Insurance Committees. s.d. Up to end of 1919 Societies were allowed a maximum sum of 3/5 per member per annum for administration purposes, Sttit    As from the beginning of 1920 this sura was Increased by 29$ to 4/5 per member per annum.The latter figure having been found to be insufficient, in view of the general increase in prices, it is proposed to make Regulations increasing it to 4/lOd, per member per annum, subject to review after two years1 experience.   This follows the recommendation of a majority of five to one on the Departmental Committee appointed by my predecessor - the Treasury representative was one of the majority.It Is also proposed to increase the Approved societies contribution to the cost of the administration of Insurance Committees from 4d. to 6d* per member per annum.Before making the regulations, certain finaneial re-adjustments of the Insurance Funds, which can only be effected be legislation, are necessary, as the additional money required is to be taken from the societies Reserve Funds.   The recent Actuarial Valuation has shown that this can safely be done.Opportunity will be taken in the Bill to relieve the Exchequer of the whole or part of its present liabilities in respect of (a) Approved Societies additional postal charges, (b) contributions to the Central Fund of Societies and (o) cost of Insurance Committees administration.   This will result in a net saving to the Exchequer of about  300,000 per annum during the next five years, and a sum closely approximating to this figure thereafter.Tho need for the Bill is most urgent in order to avoid levies on some millions of insured persons to meet administration deficiencies.The Bill will have the wholehearted support of the Approved Societies, and as no extra contributions will be imposed on1employers and employees, and the normal benefits under the Act remain unaffected, no opposition is to be anticipated from any quarter. Provisional Draft clauses of the Bill are attached.Inistry of Health, 24th May, 1921.A, MOND.
