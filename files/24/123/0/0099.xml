W.-B.The War Office, &quot;May7l92I.From:- G.O.C. Mesopotamia.To       War Office,repeated Constantinople, India.. Egypt.X. 2236 cipher May 19th.1.       Arrival of head of Turkish Division at Bitlis about beginning of May is indicated by reliable information.   Composi-tion and ?rifl.e strength of division un&amp;ntwn but believed mixed. Dispositions at present:   two battalions, strength 3?0 rifles, at Sairt;   1 battalion, strength 1^0 rifles (said to be.picked storm ?troops), at   &apos;Jazireh Ibn Omar.2.       All men between age3 of 20 and 30 in Jazireh Ibn Omar have been called to the colours by Turks.3.       It is not yet olear what is object of southerly move of this division and of recruiting activity.   They may denote further preparations for eviction of Greek force but, if Turkish force in Western Anatolia are deemed sufficient, in combination with diplomacy, to ?attain this primary object, it seems more probable that hostility against either (l) French in North Syria, or (2) British in North Mesopotamia, is intendod by these measures.At present there is nothing to assign priority to either project but Turkish designs seem certain(ly) to include ?eventua](ly)t if not immediate(ly), through control of Baghdad railway from Konia to Nisibin ?and railway route thence to Mosul. 4.       As regards prospect of any early-action ?tcwards ?Moeul,
fact that circulation of propaganda among Rtoaiamar and ether Sheikha cf Jazireh Ibn Omar and attempts to Suho?rn the loyalty of/Indian troops in Irak are virulent as ever is significant and indicates that negotiations in progress with Angora have not resulted in any change in anti-British attitude of Turkish military authorities on oUr northern frontier.
Memorandum by the General Staff.

1. The following comments are made on the information contained in the above telegram :-

(a) The Turkish Division, mentioned in para.1, is probably the 11th Caucasian Division from Bayazid. We have had reports for several weeks that this move was projected, including one from G.H.Q. Mesopotamia, dated 15th  March 1921. This move is probably one step in a side-slip of divisions which has been taking place. The 11th Caucasian will take the place of the 2nd Division at Sairt. The 2nd Division has already replaced the 5th Division at Urfa, which has replaced the 9th Division at Marash.  The 9th Division has gone to the Greek front in Western Anatolia.

(b) The mobilization of young men, mentioned in para.2, implies the extension to the Jezireh area of the general mobilization of young,men, which has been taking place throughout Anatolia. The next step to be expected, if the Turks pursue the same course that they have adopted elsewhere, is that they will bring the local irregular formations up to establishment and transform them into regular divisions. This would mean that the Disbekr Army Corps would be brought up to a strength of three divisions, as follows :-

11th Caucasian Divn, at.........Sairt.

(Present strength 2,500).

Tigris Tribes Group (Divn.?) at Nisibin.

(Present strength 1,000).

2nd Division at................ Urfa.

(Present strength 3,000).

(c) The intention of the Angora Government, mentioned in the last part of para,3,to obtain control,as soon as possible, of the Bagdad Railway from Konia to Nisibin is borne out by other information in our possession.

(d) The virulent propaganda campaign, mentioned in para.4 racalls the similar campaign which was carried on by external agencies prior to the outbreak in Mesopotamia last year, and is a cause for anxiety.

2. From the above it would appear that the Turks may possibly be preparing the ground for an incursion into the Mosul villayet; there is no other objective against which those


those preparations could be intonded?, but there in nothing so far to give us a clue as to the date when those operations will be launched. When the preparations are complete, the Diabekr Army Corps will become a formidable throat to Northern Mesopotamia, and will be 50% stronger, and far better organised and probably better equipped than it was six months ago.

3. Information was received in January from a secret source that a secret agreement had been signed between  Soviet Russia and the Turkish Nationalists, dated 27th October 1920, to co-ordinate the activities of a Bolshevik Army and a Turkish Army in an offensive against Mesopotamia and Persia. A further secret report recently received gives a translation of a report dated 2nd March 1921, by Bavlovski?, the Political Commissar of the XIth Bolshevik Amy (in the Caucasus), from which the following is an extracts:-

"Boaring in mind that an soon as the territory of Soviet Russia will have been cleared of all anti-Soviet  Governments, the Army of the Caucasus will have the great honour of giving assistance to our neighbours in the South and South-East, I consider it my duty to take serious measures to prepare the troops of this Army for the approaching campaign".

Reports are being received at, the present time from a secret source of Bolshevik preparations and movements along the northern frontier of Persia. These reports are still rather indefinite, but in view of the above  they may indicate the beginning of a combined operation with the Turks.

4. Information is also available that the Angora Government is anxious to regain control of the oil fields in Mesopotamia. In a telegram to Bokir Sami, while he was in London, they asked him to ascertain whether America would be disposed to give thorn 100 million dollars a year for a few years
f587yeans,, with-a view * to- the redemption -of &quot;the petr-olovutL. basins, ,.. of Turkey and Iraq, of carrying on the petroleum business in conjunction and in unison with the Americans, and of continuing tho sjar vvith Prance and England And recovering the petroleum business. -5.   , The truculent reply of TJihad, the Commander of the Fourth Turkish Army on the Syria - Mesopotamia front, to General Kaldane&apos;s letter on a minor frontier incident, shows his attitude of mind towards the British,.  &apos;7e must expect that he will leave no stone unturned to create difficulties for us in Mesopotamia,6.     The proposed treaty between France and Nationalist Turkey appears to have confineedthe Angora Government that France is determined to reduce her commitments in Cilicia at all costs, and they evidently count on obtaining more advantageous terms by prolonging the negotiations *   At the same time they see us withdrawing our forces from Persia and Mesopotamia, and possibly they may imagine that by bringing military pressure- to bear upon us in the Tosnl vuiayet, thoy can induce us- to make more radical amendments to the Treaty of Sevres.7*     So long as the/Allied policy towards Turkey remains unchanged,, so long must the Angora Government be expected to pursue- an active policy against us in Mesopotamia.,   The Nationalists, regard Great Britain.as the real obstacle, which prevents them from securing the peace terms that they desire, and after Constantinople, Mesopotamia is the next best area in -;hich they can annoy usV.-8,    The solution of the difficulty must be found in political action if military operations arc to be aroidedo
General Staff, War Office,London, S.W.26th May, 1921.Furthermore; the General Staff would point out that such political action should be taken quickly, if possible military dangers are to be avoided during the present summer, the period during which both Turks and Arabs indulge in their annual sport of fightings   They understand that it is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to create an Arab Government in Mesopotamia in the near future.   If this is so, they suggest that a solution of the difficulty might be found in permitting the Arab Government, as soon as it is formed, to get into direct relations with the Angora Government, and to enquire the meaning of these hostile Nationalist activities&apos; against the Arab State.   If Mustapha Kemal were to continue these activities after such enquiries had been mde, it is reasonable to suppose that he wo\ild turn the weight of Arab sentiment definitely against him, and it seems doubtful whether he would be ready to create such a situation. It seems more probable that he might abandon his activities, at ; any rate for the moment, against Mesopotamia, and thus give the new Administration of that country time to settle down, and enable the British forces to be reduced as arranged.
