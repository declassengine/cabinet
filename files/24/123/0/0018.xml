The deckers in Glasgow are refusing to handle coal and in London they have threatened to come out in a body if coal is handled in the port; at Bristol and Ipswich there have been temporary strikes.   Robert Williams professes to have had assurances from Fimmen that continental workers will refuse to load ships.There has been very little disorder.   Surface coal has been worked in m&amp;ny pieces and sold at about tb &amp; ton.   In one or two places the miners have attempted to interfere with unemployed engaged on surface workings, but if it is decided to extend the working of surface coal protection for workers could easily be arranged.The growth of the Communist Party within the last few weeks and the increase in the sales of &quot;The Communist&quot; are a serious symptom whioh cannot safely be ignored.   1* is easier to meet dangerous movements; in their infancy than when they have become numerically strong.&apos;   Sooner or later legislation will be necessary for dealing with the members of an association who are preaching violence and civil war.   Tha present procedure for sedition is antiquated and useless for the purpose which is to deal with the responsible heads of the movement and make them individually answerable to the Courts.The Communists continue to receive money from Ruasian souroes. A close enquiry is now being pursued into the disposal of money under the control of the Ruesian Trading Delegation *   Tha Third International has sent a message to the Communist Party ctoting that it would soon be able to give &quot;active assistance.&quot;May Day passed without any disturbance of the peace: from the Labour point of view the. demonstrations were disappointing.Sinn Fein in England and Scotland h&amp;s been quiesoent, though an attempted rescue of Sinn Feiners at Glasgow resulted in one policeman being killed and one wounded.In/
In. Hyde Park about 10,000 people attended.&apos;&quot;e meeting of the .Irieh Self-^terraination League on May 1st, but some of these were doubtless May Day demonstrators: the speakers made the usual accusations of outrages against the Crown Forces in Ireland.Sinn Fein in Ireland is suffering for lack of funds.   De Valera has telegraphed through Paris to MoGarrity in America, demanding  200,000 to.ct.rry the movement over a difficult period.
THE COAL CRISISOn April 28th the National Delegate Conference of the Miners Federation of Great Britain rejected the Government proposals by 899,000 to 42,000 votes on tho ground that they did not concede &quot;the fundamental principles of a National Y/ages Board and a National Pool,&quot;    This decision has been confirmed by eleven district associations.The coalfields as a v;hole have been cpiet during the week and there is littlo to report.   Many of the stoadier men would welcome a return to work, but this &apos; feelin ; is not strong&apos; enough to ensure a break in the ranks of the Federation at present.The embargo placed on coal by the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation has resulted in the refusal of dockers to handle imported coal in certain ports and in temporary atrikes at   Ipswich and Bristol: the.employment of non-union labour has for the time being overcome these difficulties, but Robert Williams has now received from Edo Fimmen, the secretary of the International Federation, an assurance that the Dutch, French, Belgian, German and Austrian workers will take steps to prevent the export of coal to Great Britain.The Workers&apos; Committee movement-is endeavouring to engineer an unofficial strike of railwaymen and transport workers on policy 15th, but present indications are that their efforts will, at. the utmost, meet with only partial success.The Parliamentary Committee rf the Trade Union Congress, the Executive of the Labour Party and the Parliamentary labour Party have issued a manifesto urging all trade unionists to give financial, parliamentary and moral aid to the miners.Distress/
w   S   .*Distress is acute in the South Wales and Lancashire and Cheshire coalfields.   Strike pay is exhausted in most of the districts, but as the local co-operative societies and tradesmen are giving credit for food this fact will only have indirect bearing on the duration of the stoppage.CHIP flIB 1ST IgDTOOg Oil THE MINtiR9&apos; strike the stoppage in the coal industry provided the Communist Party with an opportunity for which they had long been waiting and there is now conclusive evidence to show that they have exploited it to the uttermost.   The breakdown of the Triple Allianoe was a temporary check which necessitated a change of tactics and activity is now being focussed on the prolongation of the strike, by which means it is hoped chaos will be created and efforts are directed towards bringing about an unofficial strike of transport workers and railwaymen on May 15th.On April 2nd and 3rd a meeting of the ProvisionalExecutive Committee of theCommunist Party was held in london at which the extremist miners, ElrJcer, Hewlett and Watkinswere present.   The following extracts from the minutes ofthis meeting contain the outline of the official policy ofthe party towards tho miners&apos; strike:&quot;Miners&apos; Strike - The deputation from the National t Workers7&quot;&quot; Coaimittee consisting of A.V. Williams, George Poet and J. Council, was then received and a general.discussion took place as,/to joint action tobe taken during the crisis by the Party Executive and the National Administrative Council of the National Workers&apos; Committee.   The following points regarding immediate action were agreed to:   (a) That the Party&apos;a full staff of propagandists be available for work in dictricts affected by the present crisis and branches instructed to render all possible ascifvso&apos;co to the unofficial groups in districts; (b; that r?cp*?. enda should be concentrated in the weekobt parU&quot; ci the country, special attention being (3i-ven to soev6r. ts, toras and ra 11 way- centres; (o) the is-issue of leaflets dealing with the situation from the gejdes.pl poi:o&apos;t of view, and in addition special leafier to &amp;pply to particular areas; (d) the prepartvim&apos;on of a list of members of the Party who were mine is with a view to communicating with them- for . the purpose of forming unofficial groups where such did not at present exist; (e) a special leaflett addressed/
addressed to the unemployed ani a tabulated list of unemployed organisations; it) to press for the carrying out to the fullest extent of tho decisions of the M.F.G.B. that all workmen muot leave the pits.   Regarding leaflets it was agreed that the Communist Party should issue a special leaflet for general distribution and that the leaflets for particular districts should bo submitted to the Party Executive for approval and issued in the name of the National Workers&apos; Committee Movement (Miners1 Section).   A sub-committee consisting of J. MoDonald, W. Mellor.        Vaughan, and the chairman, was appointed to confer with the deputation from the. National Workers&apos; Committee in oarrying out the deoisions agreed to.   A small oommittee consisting cf W. Mellor and the miner members of the Exeoutive was appointed to collaborate with the deputation in tne preparation of tr.o leaflets for distribution at the delegate meetings of the railway-men and transport workers on the following Tuesday and Wednesday ...&quot;W. Mellor reported on behalf of the sub-committee and submitted the draft of leaflets that had been prepared for the Conferences of the railwayraen and transport workers.   The leaflets were approved.   It was agreed that members of the Executive Committee should plaoe themselves at the disposal of the Organisation Department during the crisis, and that the meeting with the Party organisers should discuss the organisation of Communist demonstrations in the different distriots.&quot;Another secret document which was circulated to communistorganisers last week carries the history of tne Communist Party&apos;\activities a step &quot;further:&apos; the Party in this case is workingdefinitely through the Workers&apos; Committee Movement and it isworthy of note that Williams and Harvey are prominent officials of the British Section of the Red Trade Union International.&quot;NATIONAL WORKERS1 COMMITTEE MOVEMENT (Miners&apos;&quot; Section)Dear Comrades,Owing to the sabotage of the Triple Alliance strike by the treacherous Labour Fakirs of the N.U.R. tnd T.W.F., the position has been made absolutely dangerous in so far as the working olass movement is concerned in order to resist the attacks of the Capitalist Class.Something drastic must be dooe. The miners&apos; figfitf as you are fully aware is the fight of the whole body of the working class movement.There has been demonstrated during the oast week a growing revolt on the part of the rank and&apos;file of the N.U.R. and T.W.and it is our duty to see that this discontent does not end in mere resolutions.The/
The National Workers&apos; Committee Movement has decided to conduct an intensified campaign In all important railway and transport centres on May 15th for an unof^fici&amp;J strike and your kelp is earnestly invited.On every possible occasion pet into the branches of the N.U.R. and T.W.F. to state the oase, Why they sheul^ render oomraon cause with the miners,   You should take the initiative in the formation of a local workers&apos; Committee or where &amp; Workers&apos; Committeo is in existence give all possible assistance in its development.   As these Workers&apos; Committees will be the potential strike committees the widost possible representation should be aimed at.Leaflets will be issued, see to it that these are effectively distributed.   See te it that the Railway and Transport Workers answer the oall on May 15th.Please report progress every three days to the National Secretary.T. Kime,8, Victoria Buildings, St. Mary18 Gate, I/ianchester.With best wishes, we remain,Yours for action,W.J.C. Eirker FifeshireT. Thomas South WalesG. Harvey Durham -Secretary     A.V, Williams Yorkshire.&quot;On April 28th, Kirker, who is a member of the executive of the Communist Party, sent an account of his activities inFifeshire to the Scottish organiser of the party.,r ... The Press has given us a pretty good show and I presume you will have seen all they have had to say on the Fife situation.   We have put up, I,venture to &apos; say, the best fight of any district in Great Britain and had-our lead been taken and followed the fight would have been in a&apos;more advanoed staffe to-day.   Unfortunately we have had&apos;to pay the price and most of the best men in Bowhill have been laid by the heels.   Already 32 of our ohaps have been arrested ... Bird is among those whom the authorities have chosen to pick out and they evidently; mean to deal with him in an &apos;exemplary&apos; manner.   Bail in bis case was fixed at  100, and yd 1 told it has cost us up to date  880 for bail alone.   As we have practically;  established the Dictatorship of the Proletariat in this village we were able to raise the money from Middle Class sources, and we.have no fear that in.any further oases we will still be able to raise the needful.   Three of our Communist comrades in Thornton were likewise in the soup, and have been outlawed by the National Union of Railwayman but the Bowhill ken came to the resoue and bailed them out of prison.&quot;Communist/
&quot;Communist Party headquarters have done pretty good work in criticising the action of the Trade Union leaders in tne present crisis, and from the propagandist stand-point they will undoubtedly come well out of the situation. But in countering the treacnery of the leaders, I must admit that they have lamentably failed.   They have lain down to the sell-out, elheit their growls and snarls still fill the air.   Action is wanted.   Such action as will bring the workers on to the field despite their leaders.   We faced this situation at the week-end in manchester, and the National Administrative Council has decided to make the attemut to call out tne Railweymen, at least, by May 15th at latest,   tfe shall require all the assistance you and tne Party can g.-ve in tne way of propaganda in N.U.R. branches, end we t;re suggesting ail propaganda should aim at establishing Unofficial Committees for the purpose of declaring a strike on that date.   I shell write you more fully later, or I may call and see you, but meantime you will be doing a service by instructing all your people to oonoentrate on this point.&quot;The &quot;Worker&quot; and &quot;Solidarity&quot;, the organs of the NationalWorkers&apos; Committee Movement, have acted as the mouthpiece ofthe CoinmuniBt Party during the miners&apos; strike.   An idea of theirpernicious propaganda may be gained from the following extracts from an article by J.R. Campbell, which appeared in the &quot;Worker&quot;of April 30th under the heading &quot;On with the Pight&quot;;&quot;The Press is beginning to admit that there may be something in the workers&apos; demands.   They are admitting this, not because they have been convinced by the faots, figures, and arguments of Mr. Hodges, but because they are beginning to get frightened of the consequences if the miners stand&apos; solidly together ... &quot; &apos;&quot;One of the most tragio features of the betrayal is the fact that the Government were on the verge of a climb-down when the strike was called off.   This incident contains a lesson for the miners.   They must not be led to accept what might appear to be a reasonable compromise, when by. maintaining a&apos;solid position they can.get the whole of their.....demands...&apos;&quot;&apos;It is therefore up to the active rank and file to see that the indignation is kept up find the attention concen-treted by creating in the railway, and transport industries a rank and file organisation-that will not relax its efforts until the Judases have been sacked and a new form of union structure more responsive to rank and file opinion has been developed from the existing one*  Now is the time for all industrial rebels to come together irrespective of what working class party they may adhere to ...&quot;It is time that the various, unofficial committees in the industry were getting in touch with each other, and forming a concrete problem.   The main task cf the rank and file organisation in the railway industry is &apos;not so much the improvement of the structure, though that can still stand some improvement, but the ohanging of the outlook;of the average railwayman.   All railwaymen and transport workers who/
who realise the necessity of this work should communicate with J.M. Messer, 31, Worth Frederick Street, for Scotland, or T, Kime, 8, Victoria Buildings, St. Mary1a Gate, Manchester, - for England and wales.&quot;&quot;Solidarity&quot;, which is subsidised by the lied TradeUnion International to the extent of nearly. 100 a week,publishes similar matter alleging that: j&quot;Discussion and resentment among the rank and file are gradually crystallising into a definite movement and the Unofficial Movement is receiving a big impetus in consequence...   Rtilwaymen in various parts of the oountry are responding to our appeal to set in motion an agitation in flavour of setting up Unofficial Committees in v many of the most important centres.   We anticipate pressure from within in future, which will have its effeot upon the policy of tne H.U.R. before long.&quot;The following is the text of the latest leaflet circulated by the Workers&apos; Committees all over the country: my correspondent reports that it was despatched from the Communist Partyfs head-quarters and that the Midlands heve been &quot;drenched&quot; with it:&quot;NATIONAL WORKERS&apos; COMMITTEE MOVEMENT (Miners&apos; Section)* L       II.   I.IL.II II        -IIl    CALL    TO    ACTIONTo the Railway and Transport Workers&quot;Fellow-Workers -&quot;Are you going to allow the miners to go down to defeat? Are you going to accept as final the treacherous decision of your leaders?   You have already declared your conviction that the miners&apos; fight is your fight.   Remember that the miners&apos; d-feat will be YOUR defeat.&quot;It is no earthly good calling the leaders traitors, renegades, and cowards, if at the same time you follow their treacherous lead.   YOU MUST REPUDIATE YOUR LEADERS.   KEEP WORKING and you play their game, you play the Government&apos;s Game, you play the Capitalists&apos; game, AND YOU SECURE THE DEFEAT OF THE MINERS.&apos;There is something more important than this.   As you know, the attack on the miners is only the first battle in the general Capitalist attack on wages.   Your industry will be attacked noxt, and the manner of your action on behalf of the miners will determine the whole working-class attitude towards yourselves when your day of trial comes.   Don&apos;t allow the splendid solidarity which existed in the early days of the miners&apos; lock-out to be broken up.   ACT!   ACT&apos;,   and by your action demonstrate for all time the unity of interest of the working class.Your/

We had high h^pos four weeks of*o that your entry into the fight would make the struggle short, sharp, and decisive.   Your leaders have set both you and us back.

But for the sake of unanimity we fix a date on which wo think you can concentrate, and your action by that dato will prove or disprove your declared solidarity with us.   For nur sake, for the sake of eur women and children, for the sake of the working-class movement, FOR YOUR OWN SAKE, set up your unofficial committees and Bee to it that the RAILWAY AND TRANSPORT INDUSTRIES ARE TOTALLY IDLE Oil MAY 16.TRX THIRD INTERNATIONAL AND THE BRITISH COMMUNIST movement the three communist organisations in this oountry are definitely allied with the Third International: the constitution of the Communist Party is based upon its principles.   The Red &apos; Trade Union International is a section of it and the Workers.&apos; Committees are affiliated to it.The platform of the Third International is therefore ofparticular importance at this juncture: it states expressly that:The conquest of political power does not simply mean a change, of personnel in the Ministries.   It means the overthrow of the hostile State-machinery, the disarmament of the bourgeoisie, cf the counter-revolutionary officers,&quot; the White Guards, and the arming of&apos;the proletariat, of the revolutionary soldiers, and of the Red Workors&apos; Guards; - the removal of all bourgeois judges, and the organisation&apos; of proletarian tribunals; tho abolition cf the rule of the reactionary State officials, and the&quot;creation of new proletarian organs, of administration ...&quot;The Communist International makes it.Its aim to put up an armed struggle for the overthrow uf the International bourgeoisie .and,.trie orertion of an International Soviet Republic as a transition stage to the comnlete abolition of State...... &quot;It is especially necessary to.carry on illegal work in the army,   navy and police...&quot;All the resolutions of the Congresses of the Communist International, as well as the resolutions of the Executive .

The following are extracts from the Constitution and Rules of the Communist Party of Great Britain as adopted at th( Manchester conference on April 23rd and 24th;CONST it up ION;. AIMS AMD OBJECTS&quot;The Party is affiliated to and adheres to the Statutes and Theses of the Communist International.The objective of the Party is the establishment of a COMMUNIST REPUBLIC of a socially and economically equal People.   It works for the total abolition of the present system of wage slavery through a social revolution and holds this to be PRE-EMINENTLY the task of its existence.   It seeks b*? EDUCATION to win the adhesion of the masses to Communism, and by AGITATION to spur the workers on towards the Social Revolution.METROES&quot;As a method of attaining the Social Revolution the Communist Party urges the adoption by tiie workers of Great Britain of the Soviet or Workers&apos; Council system so successfully applied in Russia...IMMEDIATE ACTION&quot;The Communist Party will devote itself to the immediate work of educating the masses in the principles of Communism.   It will&apos; conduct an unflinching campaign against the power of capitalism, and relentlessly strive by industrial organisation, agitation and revolutionary political and parliamentary action, to urge the working class on towards revolution.OBLIGATIONS&quot;Membership of the Communist Pb.rty is open to all who accept tho Theses and Statutes of the Communist International ...&quot;Resolution moved by Executive&quot;This conference of the Communist Party of Great Britain, having now adopted a Constitution and Rules based upon the acceptance of the 21 points of the Communist International, declares its loyalty to the Executive Committee of that International, and sends fraternal greetings through it to the Communists of the world.&quot;Resolution on Workers&apos; Committee.,Movement&quot;This conference of the Communist Party of Great Britain calls upon its members to lend assistance to the Workers&apos; Committee &quot;&quot;Movement in any endeavour it may &quot;make to rouse the workers in the railway and transport industri to the point of downing tools and making common cause with the miners.&quot;
- 9 -THE COMnjBlCTS &apos;The organisation expenses of the Communist Party of Great Britain must he increasing very rapidly; it was decided at the Manchester Conference last month that the pay of permanent offioials should be  6.10, per week; tnis salary was not considered sufficient, but one delegate pointed out that they have another source of income about which&apos; &quot;the least said soonest mended.&quot;   Headquarters now pay the expenses of travelling agitators who are therefore not dependent upon collections.   J\ L. Kerran, a member of the Executive, is shortly going to Germany, and it is significant that his brother wrote recently to him &quot;What sort of job have you got that you are enabled to travel all over the place, you lucky bounder?&quot;Extraordinary precautions have been taken to secure the&apos; withdrawal of all copies of the emergency edition of the &quot;Communist&quot; to w^ich I referred last week, and of which 80,000 copies were printed.   The Manchester organiser wrote to tho circulation manager on April 13th, &quot;I destroyed   all the papers immediately I received word to do so from the Central Office.   I had them all brought up to the Openshaw Socialist Hall and put into the heating apparatus, to the grief of the comrades who were helping.   It was like a service at the Crematorium with us as chief mourners.&quot;The Publications Department of tee Party has issued the&apos; -first edition of the &quot;Communist Review&quot;; this journal contains &apos; theoretical articles, official documents from the Communist International, reports&apos; from other countries and reports of general party activity for which it is not possible to make room in the &quot;Communist&quot;.Arthur McMarius stated at an Executive Meeting on April 3rd-that/&apos;
- 10 - jthat he was endeavouring to arrange a meeting with representative Communists from Ireland,Reports from the provinces indicate abnormal Communist activity in practically every distriot.   A typical case is that of Castleford, which has become a hotbed of agitation since the strike commenced.   So far the strikers have kept within the law, but dissatisfaction is spreading and people who have been hovering are taking courage from the lack of action against Communist agitators.In Leeds on the other hand Communists are somewhat perturoed by recent arrests, and Gee, who was to have conducted a   week*8 campaign in the district, was reported &quot;ill&quot;, and was net present at the May Day demonstration.   In Birmingham the tone of the speeches is somewhat milder owing to prosecutions, but activity is increasing.   The secretary of the West Bromwich branch is working among the local miners.   Revolutionary literature is reaching this district in increasing quantities; a news-sheet entitled &quot;The Birmingham Unemployed Bulletin&quot; has appeared; the publisher is a local Communist named Blanchard.In Leicester several Communists are now making a living by selling chocolate at lOd. per lb:   the chocolate is manufactured by the &quot;Wanetta Chocolate Co., Boston, U.S.A.&quot; and is forwarded to Leicester from London.   The secretary of one of the local oxtrernist organisations recently had four tons at his house:   furthor enquiry is being made into this matter.   On May l3t Ray of Manchester spoke in Leicester Market Place under the name of Keller.   It is now becoming the practice forBtravelling agitators to sneak under assumed names in order to avoid prosecution or summons.   Enormous auantities of tho Red Trade Union International &quot;Message for May Day&quot; have been sent J to Leicester from Communist headquarters, and it is reported that!
20 dozen copies of the &quot;Communist&quot; are sold in the Market Place every Sunday.It is reported from Copenhagen that conferences are frequently held in connection with the organisation   of the oourier service and that messengers nvw travel to and from the United Kingdom at least onoe a week.FRANCIS MM ELI, Francis Meynell has been o ensured by the ExecutiveCommitteefor non-attendance at c /    meetings and has been informed that he should attend all sessions in order to keep himself fully informed on various matters affecting policy and organisation.   In this connection a letter written by Meynell to McManus on May End is of sufficient interest to bear quotation&quot;Here&apos;s a lettor to add, I fear, to your worries.I am absolutely fed up.   Not with the Party (I needn&apos;t say) nor with its personnel (T&apos;ve never known a nicer crew to work with) but with myself and my opinions and therefore with my job.   I am - you will have noticed! no oolitician, because I am no technician in politics. You&apos;re right, that&apos;s the trouble in a long course.   But a printer I was, with a technique (the only technique I possess) a printer I am, and a printer I must become.I have for weeks now been forcing my convictions and forcing my enthusiasm; they1re hot-house plants, they have no savour.   The only stand-by in this sort of work is intellectual honesty; and that I simply have not got any longer.   I am writing things, and suggeBt-ing things for other&apos;people which are just beyond my own conviction all the time.   That doesn&apos;t - don&apos;t mistake me&apos; mean that they are positively against my conviction.   But that negative merit is not good enough.   That you&apos;11 know.Look here.   I was brought up in the poets; I.used to write poetry;.(later I bad the sense to print other people^ si)   For eight years Irve given up that, side of iife.   Now the longing has got me fixed. , I met Ralph Hodgson and W. H. Davies the other day, and had my&apos; first bout of honesty for more then a little time.   No, that&apos;s exaggeration.   But things do run almost like that,   I must get to it again, at least,for a time.Now the Pelican wants me at the end of June any way. To be frank, I want the Pelican now 1   That last can&apos;t be obviq,usly.   But that first I want you to help mo to make possible - by making an inevitable parting easy and notdifficult/
difficult.    I tell you, it will be a wrench for me, despite all I have written.    And I&apos;m jolly glad that the libel action will keep us together in one big way anyway 1   And I111 be led - what I can&apos;t be is a ieader.&quot;EFFECT OF COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA IN THE HEVYOn Friday, A^ril 29 th. c battalion of the Royal Fleet Reserve stationed at Newport refused duty, and though their spokesmen were respectful, it is reported that they were singing the &quot;Red Plug&quot; end cheering.   They were removed to their denSt at Portsmouth and distributed among ships&apos; in the harbour wdIIo tho Court of inquiry is being held.   On Sunday night, May 1st, tno red flap- was hoisted on one or more of the flagstaffa in Portsmouth, though this was probably rather a drunken escauade than a serious Communist move.   The battalion that refused duty at Newport contained about 140 miners and otner Trade Unionists.MAY day the May Day demonstrations were well attended in the orovinees, but in London the orocession was much smaller than was the case last ;/ear.   The speeches were remarkable for length rather tn&amp;n interest and dealt chiefly with the coal crisis.In Hyde Park there was a crowdy/d of about 30,^00 but a large proportion were merely oicnicing; speeches v\ero delivered from 12 platforms and at 5 o&apos;clook the following resolution was passed:&quot;This mass meeting of London, workers Bends fraternal greetings to &quot;their trade union, co-ouerative and socialist comrades throughout t&apos;;e world, who this day assemble to demonstrate their solidarity and their determination to substitute an international co-operative commonwealth for the ^resent capitalist and landlord system, which is responsible for innumerable social problems and hardships.&quot;It re-affirms its belief that the solidarity of the workers is the only means of safeguarding the peace of the world.   It therefore demands that all questions of oeace or war must rest ultimately with the workers.&quot;It/
&quot;It hails with- enthusiasm, tne success of the Russian Soviet Government, and calls oh, workers in all-countries &quot;to-refuse to provide munitions of war or the Cleans of intervention by British and other Capitalist Governments, and pledges itself to use its efforts to force those Governments to conclude oeaco with Soviet Russia on the basis of no interference in Russian internal affairs, and demands the resumption of trade witn tnat country.&quot;It demands tho withdrawal of British troops from Ireland, and urges tho working class to take drastie action to assist the Irish people to cnoo&amp;e their own form of   -Government; also, to refuse to make or carry munitions for the coercion of Ireland.   It protests against the outrages and murders oom^permitted by Black and Tans.&quot;It expresses its abhorrence of thi atrocitiesoomrnitted by Capitalist Governments in all countries.&quot;It demands a drastic handling of high prioes of food-and other common necessaries of life, and the full recogni-tion and sunport of the Industrial Co-ooerativo movement as a method of ensuring domestic supplies free from profiteering.&quot;It protests against the concerted attempt to reduoe wages and&quot;lower the standard of life.&quot;In Newcastle the Procession was one mile long and about&apos; 30 trade unions participated as did the unomoloyed, Labour Party, Communist Party and the Irish Self-Determination League; the., &quot;largest crowd on Town Moor was around the Irish platform.   At Leeds C.T. Cramp was ,the chief speaker; he was continuously heckled and called &quot;Traitor&quot; and &quot;Judas&quot;.   In Glasgow there were 24 platforms, but some were unoccupied.   Neil L!acLean, M.P., made a violent 3Peech and appealed to everyman in the audience to go into any section of tne Army wf,ich was used in the mine fields.   At Rotherham a speaker named Rannon was arrested in conseruenoe of the violence of his remarks.   At Birmingham the demonstration was larger than ever before and the communists managed to place themselves and their banner at the head of the procession, giving the impression that they dominated it, whereas their numbers were actually about 120 only.The following is on approximate estimate of the number who participated in some of the provincial demonstrations:Birmingham/
