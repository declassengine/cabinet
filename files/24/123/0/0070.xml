iSilBSsB^ of -   422il d CADI NET.^s^^T^iares of Ex-enemy Subjects in Companies operating pi Q.965 in South Africa.;^uT^P^Memorandum by the president of the Board of TradeConflicting claims have %een made on behalf of the BritishiCustodien of Enemy property and the South African Custodian to deal with shares held by enemies in Companies operating in South Africa -    These Companies are largely gold mining and finance companies some being incorporated in South Africa and some in the United Kingdom:   many have branch registers of shareholders in the United Kingdom and in South Africa respectively as well as the registers of shareholders at th8 head offioe in the country of registration.Owing to these shares having been dealt in very largely in London it is believed that the bulk of the shares held by enemies in these Companies are on a register in London.The South African Custodian has proposed that all shares in Companies incorporated in the United Kingdom should be allocated to the   English Custodian, and all shares in Companies Incorporated in South Africa to the South Africa Custodian. The Board of Trade on the other hand contended that the English Custodian ia entitled to all shares in companies in-corporated in the United Kingdom, other than those on the South African Colonial Register, and to all shares on a United Kingdom Register of Companies incorporated in South Africa, and that the South African Custodian ia entitled to corresponding shares in South African or British Companies.    The latter course would probebly result in the allocation to the English Custodian of shares with a nominal value of two or three millions sterling in excess of what he would receive under the South African proposal, even If he received the shares vested in him by orders mado before Sojth African orders and-recognised by the South African Custodian as having been
effectively vested here.Conflicting legal advice had boon obtained on somewhat similar points arising under Trading with the Dnomy legislation, but the point at isouo botwoon the South African Custodian and the English-Custodian had not been submitted for legal opinion, and at a meeting in London with the South African Custodian he was. informed that tho facts would be submitted to the Law Officorc for their opinion as to tho legal position.The facts have accordingly been submitted to the Law Officers and I attach copy of tho Law Offloors&apos; opinion together with that of their Junior.   The Law Officers.&apos; opinion is that the property in registored shares is located where the Company is incorporated.   The effect of this opinion is to support the claim of the South African Custodian to enemy shares in companies incorporated in South Africa leaving to the English Custodian the shares in Companies incorporated in the United Kingdom.      This is contrary to the opinion of Junior Counsel to the effect   that tho claim to the shares would depend on the situation of the register on which those chares are, instead of on the place of incorporation of the company.Ho precise information is available as to the financial effect of the Law Officers&apos; opinion but it is ostimatod that the South African Government will obtain an advantage of between  2,000,000 and  3,000,000 on effect boing given to this advice.linomy property in this country is charged with payment of the liabilities of German subjects and of compensation to British subjects for damage to their property in Germany and, unless Germany fulfils her obligations under the Peace treaty,   German property may bo required for this purpose. If it is not required for this purposo it may be taken for reparation purposes.   Tho South African Government have far more German property under their control than lo
required to meet liabilities of Gorman nationals to South Africans and the South African Government has determined not to realise this property for the benefit of reparation tut to return it to the Germans after 30 yeara paying a small rate of interest meanwhile.Having regard to the Law Offioers1 opinion I feel difficulty  in maintaining the claim whioh has been put forward on behalf of the English Custodian, but the handing over of this substantial block of property to the South African Custodian to be eventually returned to the Germans may glvo rise to tome criticism, and I accordingly desire the decision of the Cabinet whether I should agree to deal with the shares in accordance with the advice of the Law Officers as to the legal position.STANLEY BALDWIN. 23.5.21.
TREATY OF PEACE. TRADING WITH THE ENEMY ACTS. ENGLAND &amp; UNION OP SOUTH AFRICA.OPINION ofThe LAW OFFICERS of THE CROWN &amp; MR. Gavin T. Simonds for Mr. J. Austen-Cartmell.We do not think that the extract from the Judgment quoted on page 3 of the C&amp;m shown that, under the general law in South Africa, the property in registered shares is located where the register is, nor does the quotation from Hals bury as explained in the note (Vol.XJ.Il. page 310) support this view.    The Judgment appears to be based on the pro-visions of Act 39 of 1916, that is the South African Trading with the Enemy Act, and is perhaps a correct interpretation of the provisions of that Act.     But it does not affect the general principle that the property In shares is locally situated In the place where the company had its head Office, and the question seems to be how far the Union Act of 1916 has affected that principle.   On the whole we think that under the Act in case of a conflict the dates of the respective vesting orders determine the priority, but an earlier vesting order to have priority over a later one must, in our opinion be a vesting order In respect of the specific shares, and the general vesting orders made in this country cannot be relied upon by the Public Trustee as against a subsequent specific vesting order made in South Africa.(Sgd.&apos;)   GORDON HEW ART. Law Officers1 Department. ERNEST M* POLLOCK.29th March, 1921.OPINION ofMr. Gavin T. Simonds.1.    In my opinion the questions in issue between the English and Union Custodians ought to be compromised upon the footing that the former is entitled to all shares belonging to German nationals in Companies incorporated in the United Kingdom except those primarily inscribed on a South African Register, the latter to similar shares in Companies incor-porated in South Africa except those primarily on,a British Register.    I am, upon a reconsideration of the legal questions involved, on the whole, of opinion that shares in a Company are to   be deemed to be situate not necessarily where the head office of that Company is situate but where the evidence of title is- to be found, that is to say, if they ere primarily Inscribed upon a branch register, then where that branch, register is situate.    I think that this is the result of A.G.-V-Higgins, 2 H &amp; N 339 (see in particular per Baron Martin at page 351), though, being decided at a time when Colonial registers were unknown and the register of members was necessarily at the head office, it has misled writers, e.g. Halsbury.   (Vol. XIII. page 310) and
Dicey (Conflict of Laws 2nd Edition, page 315), into asserting baldly that shares in a Company are situate where the head office is situate.   The view that I am now expressing appears to accord with that of Mr. Justice Gregorowakl olted on page 3 of the Case and also with that of tho Supreme Court of Canada (see Smlth-V-Nova Scotia, 56, Canadian S.C.R.Page 570).     It does not give to section 35 (1) of the Companies (Consolidation) Act, 1908, the weight that has been given to that provision, but, adopting the actual locality of the evidence of title as the teat of the&apos; locality of a share I do not think, that the subsection in question operates to give it for this purpose &amp; fiotitious locality *     Section 35 (2) of the same Act under which jurisdiction to rectify a Colonial Register is exeroisable by a competent Court in the Colony appears to me, to support this view.2.     I think that under the South African Trading with the Enemy Act, in case of a conflict the dates of the respective vesting orders determine the priority, but an earlier vesting order to have priority over a later one must, in my opinion, be a vesting order in respect of the specific shares, and the general vesting orders made in this country cannot be relied upon by the public Trustee as against a subsequent specific vesting order made in South Africa.(Sgd.)
