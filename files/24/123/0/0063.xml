(Lit       This Document r-. tfm ^rop^rty ofAide-M&amp;nolre handed by Lord Hardinge to M. Briandon May 13th at 6. Q.p.m.The gravity of the situation in Silesia and the responsibility of the Allies appear to he insufficient-ly appreciated in Paris.Before there has teen time to consider the report of the CoomiSBion, a rebellious Polish leader, for whose expulsion His Majesty ^Government pressed unavailingly some months ago but who was then protected by the French and Polish Governments, has, with the scarcely concealed connivance of the latter Government, been over-running the greater part of the area in dis-pute, thereby flouting thi Allied Commission and openly defying the Treaty which an the Powers have signed.The French troops, although in a position to exercise a commanding influence, have not merely acquiesced in these proceedings, bat are alleged to have shown in soine cases, active sympathy with the in-surgents.    General Le Rond is reported in the &quot;times of yesterday to have made a speech which is tantamount to an admission that the fait accompli can be accepted without loss of dignity by the Allies.   Meanwhile the Allied Contnission appears to have abdicated its authority and to be functioning only on suffrance of the insurgents.    lien His Majestyfe Government submits a proposal for dealing with the situation thus createdthe
BRITISH EMBASSY,Paris. 13th May, 1921.the only practical suggestion which has so far &quot;been made - it is referred to a Military committee under Marshal Foch, and rejected not on military, hut almost exclusively on political grounds.The French Government is indicated by the French press to be absolutely determined to insist on the cession of the whole of the industrial area to Poland, and this is to be achieved, if necessary, by connivance in an act of unlawful and predatory violence.   If this be a correct description of the policy of the French Government, His Majesty\s Government must inform them that they cannot possibly acquiesce in any such develop-ment, and that if this course be persisted in we cannot continue to exert pressure on the German Government to refrain from counter measures, for which they can already find ample excuse and which it is easy for them, in view of their exclusive command of food and money going to the Silesian population, to apply.   Such a situation might easily develop into a crisis of extreme gravity, which the allied Powers should spare no efforts to avoid., Continued acquiescence in the existing situation is fraught with so much danger that early discussion of the matter is imperative, and the Prime Minister and Lord Curzon would be prepared to come to Boulogne to meet the President of the Council at any date that may be convenient to him.
