These vessels have been taken to Archangel.Lloyd1 s List of 13th May states that the Norwegian Steamer &quot;Camilla Gilbert&quot; was cleared from Baltimore on 25th April with 7,195 tons of American coal for Odessa.The following notice was issued from Moscow by &apos; tf/D on 7th May for entry into the channel in the Gulf of Finland, and for navigation between Kronstadt and Petrograd(l)     Ships coming from the west are to proceed towards the guardship of the&apos;entry situated within 8 leagues 26 degrees of tho Vigrund Tower, that is 590 29.2* N. Lat. 270&apos; 50.21 IS. Long.&quot; Greenwich, which tower indicates the entrance of the channel.     The guardship is a vessel - ainted black, furnished with two masts between which thero is
funnel, the upper part of which is black, the rest yellow. The guardship flies during the day on her mizzon the Republic^ spocial pilot ship flag, and shown during the night the usual position lights while a bell is rung in foggy weather.   The guardship is furnished with a wireless station which receives day and night in the English and Russian languages.   The guardship*s call-sign Is s N 3 D, It is only possible to pass through the dredged channel in the day time and by following the dredger.   Consequently ships furnished with wiroless are held liable to give warning as soon as they arrived at least 6 hours before they approach to send for the dredger, calculating their approach towards the guardship in such a way as to arrivo there towards dawn.   &quot;A demand for a dredger for ships not furnished with wireless must be made by the guardship. Such ships must arrive at least six hours, before sun rioev.&apos;(2)     In order to call the pilot, the ship must hoist in the day time the pilot flag or the signal &quot;Pilot required&quot;, according to the International Code (P.T., in Latin letters) and must hoist flag according to the International Code.   In the night time a blue light must bo shown evory 15 minutes &quot;and on tho deck surface a white light must immediately (? after) be shown during a minute with short interruptions.   In foggy weather signals must be given, intermittently long &quot;and short by means of whistles or syrens.   All these signals must last until the arrival of tho pilot on board the ship.  face *$xx -taxxx^diixxll^^ After taking the pilot on board, the ship must follow the dredger undertook the latter&apos;s charge through tho channel at ,a rate of five or six knots.   Should heavy weather prevent the passage of the guardship pilot getting on&quot;board the ship, -tho guardship must fly on the mainmast the !G* Flag according to the International Code.(3)     Ships may leave Petrograd at any hour they wish and, onco arrived at Kronstadt, must.anchor on the great roads.   After rocoiving a Kronstadt guardship pilot the ships must stand out to sea from dawn and must hand over the pilot to the entrance guardship.(4)     The Port of Kronstadt can only receive ships drawing at most 28 feet and that of Petro^rad at most 2 26 feet.(5)     The present rules are provisional until the completion of the dredging operations and until pormanent entrance guardship has been provided, after.which the passage of ships will be effected without co-operation on the part of dredgers and only with the help of pilots.-At the beginning of April the S.S. &quot;REOHID PASHA&quot; and the S.S. RD0NB arrived at Constantinople with 3,000 and 3,500 Cossack refugees respectively from Lemnos for -repatriation to Russia.    Those in the DD0MB were transferred to the s.s. &quot;XIZIL 3RMAK&quot; as the French would not risk sending an ex-Russian steamer to a Soviet port.,   It is stated that the French induced these refugees to return under false pretences, having issued a circular to the effect that the Soviet Government had granted a general amnesty to all tfrangel&apos;s ex-soldiers, but Moscow ///I of 11th May to Bronski, Soviet Representative at Vienna, states that no general amnestya.
has been granted and that eadh-oaso-will be Judged on its merits.   &quot;The foelings of Russians at Lemnos and other concentration camps with regard to the French are very fritter, and several sharp notes have been exchanged.SSTHONIAoTho S.S. ?Baltrigger11 arrived at Reval on 10th May with 78 Russians from TJhitcd states and Canada for Soviet Russia.    lie Soviet Representative at Revali after telegraphing to moscow, informed the Captain that permission to enter Russia had been refused.

These extra 67 million lire were not included in either the Ordinary or Extraordinary or Supplementary Votes reported for 1919-1920.   In the spring of 1^19 a Decree was uassed, called the &quot;Esercizio Prowisorio&quot;, which permitted tho Minister of flar or Minister of Marine to draw oh tho Treasury from the &quot;Fund for Liquidation of tfar Debts&quot; any extra sum required to balance the expenditure under the heads of &quot;Ordinary Expenditure
^Extraordinary Hftpenditure&quot;, &quot;Supplementary Votes&quot; and theamount actually spont. &apos; Tno-se 67 million lire were drawnby tho Minister of Marine in virtue of this edict, and were never published by Decree or otherwise.The irregularity of the naval and military estimates during the last three years has brought about the removal of the Naval and Military Ministers of Marine and .Var, and their substitution by civilians, although Admiral Sechi retired and remained on as civilian Minister of Marine. It has also produced many stormy meetings in the Chambers, and certainly no Deputy, and possibly neither of the Departments for to concerned knows accurately    the amount already spent, and the amount still owing.TURKEY.Extract from Turkish Newspaper &quot;Ikdani&quot;.&quot;The proposal to transfer the naval college at Halki into a mercantile marine college has been abandoned.&apos; Under the Treaty of Peace, Turkey will still bo allowed a certain number of ships, and ,Halki will be a very suitable training school for officers.&quot;On May 6th, the British S.S. &quot;Palitana&quot; was boarded by Turkish troops or police at Adalia, who removed 12 anti-Plemalists and 2 Armenians (fugitives from Adana endeavouring to reach Smyrna), killing one on board.   The master of the ship states that the usual Italian guard^liad been withdrawn from the steamer Just before the attack/and that an Italian destroyer which had beon anchored close to him sailed a short timo previously.The Italian Government are being asked for explanation.JAPAN.The Supplementary Estimates to allow for excess of expenditure over estimates in the financial year 1920-21 re-oeived Imperial - Sanction on 28th March 1923),   The share of the Navy Department amounts to 39^900^000 Yon, of which 37,100s,000 is for construction.   The equivalent of the total at par is approximately  4,100,000 pounds.DENMARK.Five Grimsby trawlers were recently fined heavily for poaching in Icelandic territorial waters.   The fine for sea-poaching was raised in May 1920 from 1,000 Kroner ( 50)to 10,000 Kroner ( 500).The duties for the uso of Copenhagen wharves, buoys and piles imposed on 26th Novemberi 1915, have, from 1st January, 1921, been increased by 200XNORWAY.The sailors and firemen strike is now almost complete in Norway and shipping is held up.   Mails for the United Kingdom are sent via Germany and vital routes from
Christiania are kept open by motor-boats.   A general strikw has been voted for 26th May whioh will affect practically all v/orkers except State employees.SffSD^N.The strike of Swedish mercantile,engineer officers was concluded on 4th May on basis of 1919 wages, to take effect immediately vath two months iiotice for both parties.FRANCS.By a decree published in April 1921, merchant ships registered in the French Colonies and Protectorates (but not including Algeria and Tunis) may be all owe d to fly the French Flag if their o*rnors are of French nationality or, in the case of foreigners, if these are under the protection of France by virtue of residence in a Colony or Protectorate.The object of this decree is to enable shipowners in French Possessions to compete more easily with * Foreign ships in distant seas.BELGIUM.The dockers and transport strike terminated on 15th May owing, it is stated, to the non-participation of the French and Dutch dockers.
GENERAL   INTELLIGENCE.PALESTINESlight unrest still continues on the coastal plain between Gaza and Haifa. &apos; The Arabs are inclined to make demonstrations but are easily dispersed when troops appear on the scene.PERSIA.The withdrawal of troops from North v7est Persia continues without interruption and they are now clear with the exception of the rearguard.The deserters from the Bolshevik forces in Gilan are reported to be coming over daily to the Persian lines and their moral is said to be getting worso.BUS S I A. .,. .11,. .... ..,_t n.A Foreign Office Circular has been issued to H.M. Representatives in European capitals that, now the Russian Trade Agreement has boon signed, the attitude&quot; of H.M. Repre-sentatives towards Soviet Representatives in the Countries to which they aro accredited should be to return but not to initiate any courtesies, and not to refuse to transact official business.   Reference to be made to Foreign Office if, in the opinion of H.II.Representative., above instructions present airy difficulties at their posts.The judgment in tho plywood case has been reversed on appeal due to the signing of the Trade Agreement, which gives &quot;do facto1 recognition to tho Soviet Government (vide eTimes&quot; of 13th May, 1921).A Russo-German Trade Agreement was signed in Berlin on 6th May, 1921.The food situation in Petrograd is reported again to be most s,serious,      Krassin, in a recent speech, stated that food   for Petrograd would shortly be imported from abroad.GERMAN Y.The new Cabinet f ormed on 10th May to accex^t the Ultimatum, consists of. four centre party members, three Democrats and three Majority Socialists.   The portfolios of finance and reconstruction are still vacant.   The new Ministry includesChancellor (Provisionally Foreign Affairs) Dr.WIRTH (Centre)vice-Chancellor &amp; Exchequer.............   Hr.BAUER(Maj.Soc)Upper Silesia.It ajypears probable that the French intended that KORFANTY s coup should have coincided-with the occupation of the Ruhr.   The Polish Government therefore failed to-take the necessary steps to stop tho preparations for the rising, and when the occupation of the Ruhr was cancelled by the acceptance of the ultimatum by the Germans, the Polish Government no longer had the power to call a halt.PART     II.
In the industrial area th3 tpv/no (i.e. principal German centres) are now occupied by French troops under martial law.   The police of the Commission are entirely out of action.   In most places in the hands of the insurgents, police and other officials Save been appointed and martial law has been declared.   British and Italian officials are frequently shot at and are only allowed to move about freely when in possession of insurgent passes.   French officers are said to have complete freedom of movement.&quot;fork in factories and mines is almost at a complete standstill.   &quot;rages and food for workers come principally from Germany and it is doubtful that they will continue&apos; supplies unless a settlement is reached.Tne Commission made a public statement that it had not in the past and would not in the future negotiate with Korfanty.H UN G A RYThe establishment of tho Hungarian Arm/- has now been reduced to the 35,000 officers and men as required by the Treaty of tho Trianons.T U R F.
