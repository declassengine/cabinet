THIS DOCmBHT IS m PROPERTY OP HIS britannic MAJESTY13 GOVERNMENT.lOHSTK *no,QA3IHKT 50TF.5 1-I-lSMPLOYMgKT INSURANCE PUNDj - A :;.RNIHG NOT.?,. MEMORANDUM BY tk6 MINISTER OF LABOUR.It is my duty to warn my col!;:: rues of tha vary serious drain upon tho resources of the Unemployment Insurance Fund that is being caused by the increasing, volume of unemployment throughout the country&apos;.    The continuance of the Coal Strike, following upon the aoute industrial depression that set in last Autumn, is producing rapidly a state of things that is causing grave concern to myself and to my advisers, tfe have pulled through a difficult Winter with remarkable freedom from social disturbance; and to this result, the operation of the Unemployment Insurance Acts of 1920 and 1921 have beyond question proved a considerable, if not the chief, contributing factor.    But the solvency of the Unemployment Insurance Fund is threatened by the volume of unemployment at the present time which is already without prece dent ^ at id until the miners go baok to the mines, will grow steadily ^orse.Nor is the threatened insolvency of the Insurance Fund Itself our only concern.     Even if the miners were to go back to work shortly and industry were to revive in a fe/v weeks&apos; time, it is probable that by the end of June, several hundreds of thousands of workers of both series will h a ve e xh aust e d the in r* 1 cfo t to benefit under the ^ Ac t o f 1921L 8ndjyiiLnot be able to draw benefit again until Noyembe In other words, large numbers of men and women, JLnclud.Ing a consldaraole proportion of^ex-Service men, will be out of benefit for the four months, July to October, *no^usi2fLI/and
and that at a time when Trada Union hone fits and other resources .vill also he exhausted.It may be convenient if I set out quite briefly the present financial position of the Unemployment Insurance Fund.     The Cabinet sill recall that under the provision of the Unemployment Insurance Act, which became law on the 3rd March, 1921, rates of benefit at 20/- a week for men and 16/- a week for wcmen were made applicable to practically the whole wage-earning population of the cmmtry outside*agriculture and domestic service.    The Act was designed to bring ex-Service men into insurance;   to make special provision for- unemployment arising cut vt the already existing, industrial depression;   ani to increase the benefits both, in amount and period psyaole in any insurance year.     An important feature of the Act was the provision of two special emergency periods of eight months each, from March to October (inclusive) 1921;   and from November (inclusive) 1$21 to June (inclusive) 1922;   and the provision of 16 weeks&apos; benefit &amp;4 a maximum for each of these special periods.     The Act ,ves financed partly by increased contributions which sill become payable as from the 4th. July next, and partly &quot;by drawing upon the accumulated Insurance Fund which then stood at about  23 ,000 ,000.In the detailed discussions that were held upon the framing of the Act between the Treasury and the Ministry of Labour, it was agreed that the scheme would be financially sound up to July 1922, provided that the average number of unemployed persons drawing benefit throughout the whole emergency period of 16 months did not exceed 1,000,000 workers a week.     It was.always made clear to the Treasury that if throughout this emergency period, the hopes of an/industrial
industrial revival were falsified and the average number Of unemployed persons drawing benefit were in fact greater than the number upon which the finance of the scheme wa3 based, the Act would either have to be remodelled, or direct financial assistance given to the Fund.It is not yet possible to predict with any certainty what the financial position of tho Fund will be by the end of October, i.e., at the close of the first spooial periods   but the facts are disquieting and must be faoed.      The number of workers wholly unemployed at the beginning of Maroh 1921 was 1,200,000 rising to over 1,750,000 on the 22nd of April.      In addition, during the same period, the number of workers on short-time has risen from 760,000 to Just over 1,000,000.      The weekly excess of expenditure from the Fund over the income is roughly  1,200,000.     If this weekly deficit continues, the Fund will be exhausted by the end of July.      If the Miners were to go back to work soon, a substantial Improvement in employment in a few weeks* time would restore   the position; but if the stoppage continues and unemployment increases, it la possible that there may be an increasing additional deficit which would exhaust the Fund by the endii nin n T&quot;  i rin i ii --tr-rnpTiT in fii i i irtr &quot;&quot;&quot;Tin I&quot;-&quot;&quot;i--trr&quot;--&quot;T&quot;T mDmm      &quot;i 11 i &quot; 1--------- m ------ ni      .....nim i     mri    i inainwintii i -niim  n m jUnKmwWOof June.Tho measures that I am considering may take several alternative forms.      ffhere is first the question of making some provision for workers who will have exhausted benefit by the end of June, and will be without benefit for the four months period from July to October, Inclusive. There is, further, the question of restoring financial stability to the Inauranoe Fund by increasing the contributions/from
from employdrs and employed, and /or reducing the rate of benefit;   or of advancing money from the Exchequer. Some of these measures&apos;would require legislation, others could be car-Mod out ,/ithout legislation,I am not asking for a decision of the Cabinet at this moment.     I am exploring with my advisers the various alternatives that present themselves, and will discuss them with the Treasury at an early date.     But I am anxious that my colleagues should be apprised of the position now in order that they may appreciate the urgency of the problem when my alternative proposals are placed before them.(Signed)   T. J. MACUAMARA.Ministry of Labour. 3rd May, 1921.
