(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPFRTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S ..SOVSRMMEIW?).SECRET. C A BINE T.CP.2912. NORTH DliVON LIGHT RAILWAY.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.With.reference to the Minister of Labour&apos;s note on the above Bt&amp;jeot dated 19th April, 1921 (CP,2849), I dee ire to make the following observations:-(1)   The provision of any contribution for a Light Railway Scheme will require a Supplementary on the Ministry of Transport^ Vote and there are obvious objections to the introduction of Supfc&amp;teftfcaries *(2)   If financial support were given to this particular scheme it is practically certain that demands for assistance to equally desirable Light Railways in other parts of the country would be forthcoming.(3)   There is no evidence that unemployment in Devonshire is more acute than elsewhere.(4)   On general grounds I am of opinion that Government assistance to unemployment should be confined to tho substantial provision which has already been rnaae through the St.David1s Committee.    I have little doubt that the best service which the Government can render in the unemployment problem is to reduce public expenditure.    To the extent that relief measures are paid for from taxation they represent tho removal from the resources of tho general body of tax-payers of sums of money which (If left In their pocket) would inevitably have been available-lable to increase employment in other directions more likely to bo profitable than those which the Government is asked to suppcrt.Por the above reasons I havo come to the same conclusionas my predecessor, who felt unable to agree in present circum-stances to financial assistance from tho Exchequer to tho pro-moters of Light Railway Schemes, and I feel bound to recommend the Cabinet to reject the proposed scheme.Treasury, S.W.      - (Xntd)   R.S.H.K*Y 7th 19S1.
