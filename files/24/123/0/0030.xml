TheUnited Kingiom hab already adopted the principle of compulsory disinfeOtion and it is to our interest that other nations should be brought into line by means of an International Convention,   11,1 .t(2) Much disease arises from lead poisoning caused by the use of lead in the painting.industries and the question of remedial measures and of substituting less harmful oubotanoen for lead in paint have been under. .: consideration in this and other countries for many years past*: Bo. far,;^j the United Kingdom is oonoernedi; ^hevquestilon was considered by.,tvo ; Departmental O^H94A^!mp-.f(tqii0&apos;i^oVcdlMm^ a*4 Pnc. for carriage.painting)appointed by the Home Office in 1S31, .and. these Oomroitteesf. after hearing a large number of witnesses, recommended the total prohibition of paint containing more than 6$ of its dry weight of a soluble lead compound exoept for certain special and very limited uses.  As, howeverf the Reports of these Committees were not reoeiyed until after the outbreak of war, no action, has hitherto been taken on theouProhibition will be strenuously opposed by the lead Interests, who6 have already started a compelgn against it. but there is undoubtedly a strong case for 1$ on the grounds that the use of lead paint oaases a large amount of disease and ill-health among painters, that precautions are difficult to apply and that efficient and Innoottous substitutes are available) and sofar.no fresh facts appear to have been brought forward which were not before the Departmental Committees^   It is important to note that the Offioe of Works hab been using leadlesb -f&amp;nfcit tflr a number of years now and with very satisfactory results *I propose to reply to the Intentional Labiur Offioe \hd the British welter is in favour of a Draft Oonve^itMi for the -prohibition of the
use of lead in paints being submitted for the consideration of the Conference. At the Conference the question can be thoroughly discussed, the views of employers and workers who will have representatives on the Conference will be heard and all the considerations that can be urged against as well as for prohibition will be set out and duly weighed.

(3) As regards the weekly rest day, I propose to say that the British Government considers that an International Convention establishing a principle of the weekly rest day, which should be so far as possible Sunday, would be desirable and practicable in industrial undertakings, industrial undertakings being defined so as to exclude commercial undertakings and the mercantile and fishing services. The Convention would provide, of course, for any necessary exceptions, such as industries involving continuous processes.

British legislation already provides for the weekly rest day in the case of women and young persons in the manufacturing, mining and quarrying industries, and as the principle of the weekly rest day is much more firmly established in this country than in most, it appears to me that it would be to the advantage of this country that other States should be brought up to the British standard by means of an International Convention.

It has been suggested that any legislation which touches the Sunday question may give rise to difficulties, but so far as industrial undertakings are considered, I do not apprehend much difficulty in passing the requisite legislation. In the case of commerce the position is different. Though the custom of the weekly rest day is widespread in this country difficult questions in connection with Sunday trading, etc. would arise, and I think the British representatives should be content as regards commercial undertakings with a "Recommendation" by the Conferences, which would raise the question and lead to a full discussion before further measures are taken.
