0 R IS T. 2994.CABINET.DISPOSAL OF SURPLUS WAR MATERIAL.z BY THE. CHANCELLOR Off THE EXCHEQUER .COVERIHG&quot;TmolAiIirjOY THE &quot;DISPOSAL&quot; board.I attach a memorandum &quot;by the Disposal Board on the subject vof a ^lock1 deal for disposing of the whole of the material now under their charge,,I; agree with the view of the Board that the proposal immediately before them should not be accepted.They, however, also ask for an indication of the Govern-menfs views on the question whether any variation of this kind of proposal would as a matter of policy be countenanced by the Cabinet.   It is difficult, if not-impossible, for the Cabinet to pronounce upon such a question without concrete proposals: but I think that the Disposal Board might be informed that such suggestions as are put forward in &quot;Article VII cf the&apos;memorandum do not seem to be unsound in principle and that proposals along these lines, if otherwise   acceptable, should receive considera-determination (Intld.)   R.S.H.ury Chambers, S.W. )th May, 1921,
o  &quot;7  a  &quot;3   t&quot;&apos;  rn o        y   jjv  i   x *K E 11 0 R A If D U,!,:.&apos;,I. The decision of the Cabinet is required on thequestion of policy involved in the following matter ;-II. Certain proposals have been brought under tho con-si deration cf the Disposal Board of the Disposal and liquidation Commission, involving the question of the sale uneer a block contract of the remaining surplus war stores which the Board have, or will have, for disposal. III. These proposals are summarised in the attached pre-liminary draft of Reads of Agreement, and pending a decision on the general principles involved, the Board desire to present the fc &quot;Mowing observations on the proposals in question:-1.   The Agreement purports to be an agreement for outright sale, but in reality resembles. . an agency Agreement.The  5,000,000 referred to in Clause (l), ;    &quot;in consideration of which the purchaser obtains possession of the property in question is to be repaid out of the first proceeds of sale, and after such repp.yment the Government will have no financial hold Over the purchasers. 2. Under Clause (2) the purchaser will actually be in receipt of a 5% commission, which, estimating the value of surplus stores still available at  100,000,000 will amount to  5,000,000 less administration expenses, (roughly estimated at  100,000). The purchaser.is practically taking no risk.
1 5933. The purchaser would have to arrange &quot;an organisation for dealing with the vast quantity and *reat variety of materials involved, and this must of necessity take time.4, There- would &quot;be reasonable ground for Parliamentary and public criticism if the purely opportunist, offer of an individual person or, firm were accepted under the authority of the Government to the exclusion of any competitive offers v/hioh might have been made if facilities on a &quot;basis of tender, or otherwise, had been more widely given.IV. The above* considerations.render it impossible forthe Board to recommend the acceptance of the proposals in their present form..V.        ,  They consider., however, that these draft Heads of Agreement do not necessarily represent the final basis upon which any proposition for the acquisition of all remaining surplus Government property might be negotiated.,VI. They desire, however before proceeding any further to obtain the decision of the Cabinet as to whether theprinciple of a ^lock&apos; deal is, or is not, in itself desirable.VII, If the Government consider that the principle of a block deal is to be encouraged, the Board are of opinion that the practicable lines of procedure are confined to two alternatives
(a) To select a nvmbe-r of business people whose standing is beyond question and who are eapable of constructing an organisation to deal with this complex matter, and to give them approximate information of the quantities and value 6f the material which the Board is likely to have available for sale, in order to ascertain the terms which they would be prepared to offer.This proposal would eliminate the danger underlying any indiscriminate invitation of offers, viz, the tempting proposals which would inevitably be put forward by a host- of speculators with everything to gain and nothing to lose, the verification of whose credentials would present grave difficulties.(b) To subvdivide the material available for sale, selecting in each trade a firm of high standing with the necessary experience and organisation with a view to an outright sale or to an agenoy Agreement.In forming a conclusion both on tho general principle involved, and also cn the two alternatives above presented, the Board are of opinion that the following considerations should be taken into accountOn the one hand, in addition to the difficulties presented by the actual proposals at present received which difficulties have been referred,,to above, the following oiroiimstanffes are evident
(a) Mo one firm is likely to have both experience and existing organisation sufficient for dealing forthwith withthe variety and mass of materials involved,(b) &apos; Owin.j to the complicated nature of the transaction, it would De difficult to draft an agreement which would adequately protect the Government in ever, respect.(c) Owing to the fact that many of the Lands and Buildings in possession of the Govern-ment are only held temporarily under the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Lands) Act, it might be difficult legally to re-tain possession if they were transferred for sal e t o&apos; a c omne to la 1 c one e rn. ,Therefore the elimination of all real property from a block deal would he es&amp;en-tial, and for considerations of policy and of administration Railway hidings and ?,-orks together with all property and movable stores, in India, Lgypt, 3fesopo.ta.iiia,&apos; the Black Sea ^rea, and the occupied regions in Germany should in the board&apos;s view be similarly excluded, at any rate for the present.These exceptions would to a large extent modify, in the eyes of the purchaser, the value of a block deal, and a purchaser would probably require protection against competitive selling of the stores lying Overseas,fa)
(d)   A great measure of the success which theDisposal  oard may claim up to the present to have achieved has been due to the good rela-tions which have been maintained between the Board and other Government Departments, more particularly the Army and the Navy.   It is hardly probable that, with the introduction of a third party of an entirely eommercial standing, those relations will remain unimpaired, fe)   The conclusion of a block deal would not eliminate the necessity of maintaining in existence such Government staff as would be requisite to protect the Government interests under the, contract; to deal with material under (c) above and to administer contracts previously entered into. On the other harlGt, the principle of a block deal-appears to involve certain positive advantages:-(1)   A commercial organisation would not experience the difficulty perpetually presented to a Government Department which is known to be in process of gradual dissolution, and which cannot therefore hold out future prospects to its employees.The best men are continually leaving the service of the Disposal Board for more remunera-tive business appointments, whereas a firm of sufficient standing to contemplate a deal of this nature, would have no difficulty in attracting am? retaining the requisite expert staff.
(2)   A commercial undertaking well organised with the necessary capital and experience might be able to secure a wider market, more rapid liquidation and higher prices than would be the case if the Disposal Board remained in operation.The Board recognise that wider questions of policy, into which it is not within their competence to enter, may be involved, and that such questions may necessarily be the determining factor in any decision at which the Cabinet may arrive.They are not individually, or collectively, anxious to prolong their existence as a Board for a single day longer than the Government considers that it has urgent need of their services, but they would be equally reluotant after sales of surplus property^ amounting to some  300,000,000, to see the completion of their onerous duties undertaken by others, unless it was clear that it would result in a substantial saving to the Ex-chequer.
