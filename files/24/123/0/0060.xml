SECRET * DIRECTORATE OF INTELLIGENCE^Report Ho. 106 (Home Office)Scotland House, 3;**,*J* 19th Hay, 1921.REPORT ON REVOLUTIONARY ORGANISATIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.&quot;**0 00***.....&apos;&quot;** &apos;-&apos;**&apos;-TZVT. **(Circulated by the Home Secretary)THE MINERS.......................................Page 1THE COMMUNISTS................................... &quot; 2RED TRADE UNION INTERNATIONAL...____......... &quot; 5UNREST AMONG RESERVISTS.................,........&quot; 7C0-0PERATIV3 AND LABOUR ALLIANCE................. &quot; 7ARRESTS AND CONVICTIONS......................... . &quot; 7SINN FEIN IN GREAT BRIMN....................... &quot; ireland.......................................... &quot; 9SUMMARYThere has been little outward change in the coalfields: distress is increasing and probably most of the miners would welcome a return to work.The embargo on coal by the National Union of Railwaymen and the Transport   orkers is still maintained, but coal is successfully being moved by volunteer labour.The recent police action in respect of the Communists has had a very damping and&quot;depressing effect.    Their machinery has temporarily been dislocated and many of them are uneasy about their own future. Francis Meynell has taken the trouble to inform the police indirectly that he has severed his connection with politics:   the national Labour Press has decided to discontinue printing &quot;The Communist&quot; and has offered all oopies of the new number to the police.There was an outbreak of Sinn Fein outrage in London, St. Albans and Liverpool on Saturday night.    The persons attacked were relations of men serving in the Royal Irish Constabulary.   So caUcue Were the criminals that they shot a man and a woman without stopping to enauire whether they were the right persons.    The vigorous police action taken on Sunday has for the moment checked any further outrages.    It is believed that three at least of the persons actually ensued are among those arrested.   They belong to the lower middle class.A severe outbreak of violence is expected In Dublin within the next few days, probably involving an attack upon the Castle.
Tire gima.On the v/hole the coalfields have been renaric?.bly orderly during the week:   distress is acute in South Wales hut in many districts food is being obtained on credit,    (Phis fact undoubtedly has much to do with the absence of disorder, but local associations will be heavily handicapped by debt for many months.Only the extremists desire a continuance of the stoppage:   a very large number of miners openly say that they are indifferent to the National Pool as long as they are assured of a &quot;living&quot; wage.There have been disputes between sections of miners regarding the working of outcrops in various coalfields and frequent cases of intimidation in South Wales and Scotland.    On May 15th eight farm fires were caused in the mining area of Fife.    Three Sinn Fein miners, who are members of the Lochgelly detachment of the Irish Republican Army, were arrested in this connection.The executives of the railwaymen and transport workers fear to face the risk of calling a strike and decided last week to strengthen the embargo on coal;   this decision was reaffirmed at a joint meeting yesterday. Some of the miners1 leaders object to the action of their partners in the Alliance, which they say deprives them of the credit of winning &quot;on their own&quot;.Dockers in Glasgow are still on strike, but the men who struck in sympathy at Greenock and Aberdeen resumed work on May 16th.    There is much dissension among Glasgow railwaymen as the steady majority refuses to follow the lead of their extremist officials who are still trying to force the National Executive to call a general strike.
THE COMMJNISTS.The leaders of the Communist Ptjrty and local officials are greatly perturbed by recent prosecutions and there is evidence to show that the work of the Party has been partially disorganised.    Orders have now been issued from headquarters to the effect that in order that arrests may be avoided no official of importance must speak in public, and preparations are being made to carry on the movement &quot;underground&quot;,    it stated in the branches that the Party is forming a &quot;Secret Service&quot;.    Emery has been appointed &quot;Secret Service Agent&quot; for the Midlands;   the nature of his duties is not yet clear, but it seems that he will endeavour to counteract police action and will be responsible for the security of any foreign emissary who comes into his district.There appears to be a temporary scarcity of money a headquarters: branches are not over*punctual with their subscriptions* Netherfield, for instance, which has be in existence, for three months has paid no dues at all; Walsall says that it cannot afford to pay any, and that as plenty of money is coming from Russia to headquarters headquarters should finance the district councils.The circulation of the &quot;Communist&quot; has been affected by the seizure of the lists of agents from headquarters and several branches are complaining because they have not received their usual supplies: more copies of the &quot;Communist&quot; are sola in Leicester than in any other Midland town.MJjr correspondents report that the action takenagaifcst communists has been warmly welcomed by all butthe extremists-.     There is still, however, a demand forgreatest stringency in the treatment of agitators.Efforts/
Efforts to permeate trades unions are maintained andthere is no doubt that this will be the ohief sphere of *communist activity in the future as it Is the safest and themost effective form of propaganda.   At a Continental.conferenceof leaders of Bolshevik: propaganda and organisation, heldvjust before the miners1 strike, the following   Interestingreport of the movement in England was given:&quot;The movement aniong the British working classes has no serious connection with party aims or with ideals -it is based solely on. purely economic motives.   It is quite impossible to reform the psychology of the British worker in the short time we have at our disposal, and it is no use wasting energy and time on any such attempt. The factors liable to lead to a crisis in the near future are to be found in those districts where the industrial war is at present raging.   Although owing to the comparatively small number of unemployed, and to the partial restoration of industry, England appears on the surface to be In a better position thai the other European countries, there are nevertheless several indications of the possibility of an economic catastrophe therea    Individual production has decreased and continues to do so.   An acute industrial crisis appears inevitable.    In view of these facts it Is absolutely necessary that we strengthen^,our connections with those labour organisations who are&quot;opposed to our ultimate aims.   In this connection I wust say that the working masses of England have recently made great advances. We can now count on a really organised Proletariat. The strikes oC the past years have shown to what extent the working classes have gained ground;   they have grown to be a powerful Government organisation.   The Labour leaders, who are opposed to us, will give us no opportunity of taking matters into our own hands. However, the lines on which the class campaign is at present being carried on, tend to show that they are approaching us.   I do not consider it impossible that, in the future, under more advantageous political conditions, we may succeed in gaining a stronger influence over the labour leaders.   However, that is a question for the future*   It would be a grave mistake to attempt a fight with only the unimportant forces which we have at our disposal in England to help us. It would only lead to the formation of a bitter spirit against us among the masses of the workers.&quot;We have gained all that it is possible to gain under existing conditions amongst the English Proletariat.   The economic strikes which paralyse the work of the Capitalists and which deprive the Government of the possibility of attacking us on other fronts are much more to our advantage than would be the prominence of small isolated organisations.   Further it is obvious that the centre of our work is in England itself.   It is just as difficult to work amongst the English workers when they are at hone, as It is easy to influence them when they are away from their ordinary environment.&quot;As/\

&quot;As regards propaganda amongst the troops, we found that their susceptibility was in exact property to their distanoe from home.&quot;The Irish question ia quite another matter. Unlike the English, the Irish are very easily influenced by appeals to the ideal.   Wo have a firm base in Ireland.   The revolution, which started as a purely Nationalist movement, supported by the clergy, has already assumed the character of a class campaign,; To just such an extent as this ia the case the danger grows for capital supported by tho Government.   *&quot;e no. dare to state that it is impossible to suppress the revolutionary fire in Ireland by any means whatsoever,; In fanning this fire we have discovered tho enormous importance of the direct influence of the English working masses.   On examining the workings of English mentality the nrisis in which the Capita list-Parliamei system at present finds itself involved, becomes perfectly clear.   The Government&apos;s power of initiation is gradually decreased, and the constantly growing &quot;  movement of mutual understanding which is inconsistent; with Capitalism completely paralyses the Government, j England revolutionary ideas find much less favour amongst the workers than In other countries.   The English worker lacks class consciousness.   The excitement offered by an active revolutionary fight d: 1 not appeal to him.   Particularly is this the case in I England where life is obstinately carried on in the same old-fashioned style.   At present so strong is this factor that there is no possibility of depending on the English Proletariat as regards interior polltil Questions of foreign politics are mostly outside the sphere of those factors which paralyse our work.&quot;If it should be necessary (feo use England to assist in the carrying out of the general plan, despi all the weaknesses of our movement amongst the Englisi Proletariat   it may be considered that such a course of procedure Is practicable.&quot;An unconfirmed report has been received from PIga that the Third International is spending  24,000 monthly for agitation in Great Britain.The London District Council of the Communist Party is I in close touch with the London District Council of Unemployed Organisations:   Cant is the moving spirit and the object ia to create revolutionary feeling among the unemployed;   the headquarters of both bodies are at the International Socialist Club. 1The &quot;Workers11 Dreadnought&quot; last week contained the ft following paragraph:&quot;WANTED/
m  5  -&quot;wanted;   a postcard&quot;In  ,s.d. every week we must reoeive from Comrades, as voluntary subscriptions,  30,   If Monday&apos;s post  does not bring us that sum wo cease publication.&quot;If you cannot send any money, send us a postcard; we111 treasure it as a remembrance of good days of hard struggle.&quot;THE SEP TRADE UNION INTERNATIONALThe headquarters of the Red Trade Union International in Manchester have been raided by the police in connection with the publication of the leaflet &quot;A Call to Action&quot;,   A number of interesting documents were seized and these bear out in every respect the information already given in my reports.   It seems that of the  4,000 sent.by Moscow to 3tart the movement in this oountry  2,600 were allocated to the Shop Stevjards movement.It is interesting to note that.the publicity committee recently started in London has spent  235,12.3, from a total of  300 received from Booth and that of this sum  158 has been paid to the &quot;d..ily Horald&quot; for advertisements.It seems probable that the British Bureau received a second instalment of-money from Moscow in the third week of Ms:rch;   on March 9th &quot;the financial situation had developed to the appointed of breakdown&quot; &quot;out &quot;successful steps were taken over-night to raise a loan to cover expenses for two or three weeks, by which time it could be reasonably expected that the allocated funds would materialise.&quot;  -The &quot;allocated funds&quot; **re doubtless part of the  50,000 set aside by Moscow for use of the Red Trade Union International in various countries.   This inference is supported by the f&amp;ci that since April 1st Poet has received from Booth the following amounts, totalling  2,300, which do not include &quot;fitanding expenditure&quot;, subsidies to &quot;Solidarity&quot; or sumspaid/
paid to the Publicity Committee:April  1st  100&quot;      8th  100   ,&quot; * 12th   &quot; &apos; &quot; &apos; ;  100&quot;&apos;X       &quot; 20th &quot;  1/500 -&quot; 22nd  300X       &quot; 26 th  300     &apos;The sums marked&apos; &quot;x&quot;&quot;were ear-marked for the NationalAdministrative Cornell of the Workersr Corarlttee Movement,&quot;Standing expenditure&quot; of the,.Bure^-; (jL;.e.. organisers1salaries, etc.) is about  150 per week.   The Bureau is ina position to carry on existing current liabilities untilJuly 1st, and &quot;there is also a sufficient sum to warrant tlconsideration of the extension of the general work of the bureau.&quot;The raid on the Manchester headquarters upset the plan for aa unofficial strike on May 15th and the possibility oi action by transport workers and railwaymen added to the complication of the position.   It is now rumoured that on a given date unofficial committees will endeavour to seize unoccupied houses and instal themselves therein.On May 14th, 200 delegates attended a meeting of the Northern section of the movement convened by Harvey. A.V. Williams addressed the meeting but it was evident thai the delegates had no mandate:   although it was agreed to make preparations for a general strike as soon as possible, it is certain that there will be no backing from the unions concerned.The South Vales and Monmouthshire branches of the National Union of Railwaymen and Shop Stewards movement have appointed a committee which includes T.C. Morris (Ystrad Rhondda), George Richards (Cardiff), S\G.Cadwallader (Tredegar), J. Noonan (2&apos;ort Talbot).    Chairman, 33.1.Hare. 1 (Port Talbot) Secretary, and A. Charles (Port Talbot) Assistant Secretary.At their annual conference the National Union ofBoot/
Boot and Shoe Operatives refused to affiliate with the Red Trade Union International,It is reportod from Devonport that the unrest among the Royal Heet Reserve in that port is not of a serious nature.   Many of the men consider *that their services should only he used in the event of war and object to being called up in an industrial crisis:    a large number are miners and transport workers who sympathise with the strikers.At Aldershot everything is reported quiet:   pay night on Friday passed without any disturbance.(%)-Q?SRaTIVB ,JE) LABOUR ALLIANCE.The Scarborough Co-operative Congress rejected b^ a majority of four the proposal for a labour co-operative political alliance, the voting being for 1682, against 1686.Tho decision of the Congress will meet with the approval of the great mass of co-operators, but the smallness of the majority is a proof of the energy with which extremists have worked to capture the movement.The National Executive of the Co-operative Party, the Women1 s Guild and the Heivs Guild issued a manifesto prior to the Congress appealing to delegates to vote for the alliance.It was stated at the Congress that the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; directorate had decided to  :ive co-operators a directly elected representative on the Board to ensure to co-operators a measure of control &quot;proportionate to their financial interest in the &amp;C*per.&quot;ABPJB3TS AND C gVICTICB5- On May 12th J.H. Dinney, secretary of the Rotherham branch of the Communist Party of Great Britain, was fined  50 or in default was sentenced to two months1 imprisonment for making; speeches calculated to cause sedition and disaffectionamong/
M      3      Mamong the civilian population on May 5th.On May 14th Alfred Wilson was sentenced at Pontefract to three months&apos; hard labour and fined  50 (or in default three months&apos; imprisonment - to run-consecutively) for a speech made at Castleford on May 8th.On May 16th, Jack Leekie, who has been &quot;on the run&quot; for some months was charged at Birmingham in respect of a speech made in the Bull Ring.   He was remanded until to-morrow, bail being refused.On May 17th, John McLean and &quot;Sandy&quot; Ross were sentenced to three months1 imprisonment for seditious speeches made at Airdrie.   Ross was further ordered to pay a fine of  20 or in default was sentenced to three months1 additional imprisonment,,   McLean has declared that he will hunger strike and has dieted himself &quot;so that the shock to the system shall be less.&quot;   He says that if hs dies in prison his &quot;murder will be at the door of the Government.&quot;SIM EEIH Ij GREAT britain during the night of May 14th - 15th there v/as an outbreal of Sinn Pein activity in London, St. Alban3 and Liverpool: the families of men serving in the Royal Irish Constabulary m attacked in their houses by armed and, In some cases, masked men.   Five people were wounded and one of the victims died yesterday.   In some instances the raiders attempted to set fir to the houses.Por some time past it has been known that a series of outrages in England had been planned by the extreme faction oi the Irish Republican Army, and there is little doubt that, but for the prompt action taken, the outrages would have continued But on Sunday and Monday sixteen of the most active Irish revolutionaries in London were arrested, five of them being women.   Orders of internment have been made against six men, and four of the women are now detained in   Holloway Prison whi.    the/
the question oof finding a place of&apos; J^ernment lor them is being considered.   For the most part they belong to the lower middle class - minor oivil servants, teachers&apos;, etc.Among the persons arrested it is believed that three were actually concerned in the outrages, but it is doubtful whether the witness will identify them, so great is their fear of reprisals, even if they are able to recognise persons who visited them in the dark.On Hay 18th a determined attempt at escape was made by Sinn Seiners in Stranseways Prison, Manchester.   The prisoners were overcome after a severe struggle with the warders.)fcuc.y O^eill addressed a meeting at the rjJnpire Cinema, Willesden, on May 15th.   After stating that she was not going to discuss Ireland, she gave a lurid description of atrocities alleged to have been perpetrated in B.-lbrig&amp;an and showed the stump of her left arm which she said had been amputated, as blood poisoning followed a bayonet thrust from an Auxiliary.   The audience of 400 was much impressed by her allegations.On Ma$- 15th E.B, Fitzgerald, M.A. (Bolfast) addressed two meetings at York, under the auspices of the Irish Self-Dotermination Lo^ue.   Ho made scandalous allegations against the conduct of the Crown forces in Ireland and his speeches have been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions.IBI2LA1DThe general situation in Ireland shows no improvement: 18 members of the Crown Forces and  2 women were killed during the week.    Attacks have been made on isolated members of the Royal Irish Constabulary and on small patrols as well as on police barracks and on military lorries in the Dublin area.On May 14th a daring attempt v/as made to rescue sinn feiners in Mount joy Prison.   After capturing an armoured car a group of rebels proceeded to the prison dressed as Arsiyofficers/
officers held up the Governor and his assistants and locked them up; the alarm was given by a sentry and the  Sinn Feiner? made good their escape in the car, which was abandoned after? the guns and ammunition had been removed.

Numerous raids have been made on the made and the mails money and? goods are frequently commandeered by the Irish Republican Army. A considerable quantity of Government material and stores has been destroyed, possibly With the connivance of railwaymen and dockers.

The Crown Forces have successfully attacked bands of armed Sinn Feiners, some of whom have been killed or wounded and others taken prisoner: among the prisoners are several Irish Republican Army officers.

Evidence has been accumulating that there will be within? the next few days a serious outbreak in Dublin, including, in? all probability, an attack upon Dublin Castle. The authorit? in Ireland have been warned.

Briand&apos;s memorandum about Silesia (already issued in the telegram section and since circulated in print) which I sent to the French Ambassador on Friday for communication to the French Government. ,   -C. of K. *Foreign Office,May 23, 1921.&apos;[6260 b]
