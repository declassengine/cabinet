PART I-THE LABOUR SITUATION.the general situation.General Survey of the Week.There is no outstanding event to report in connection with the coal industry dispute. The formal resumption of negotiations has not yet taken place, and, with regard to sympathetic action, critical developments have been avoided. The coal industry dispute remains the most important fact in the industrial situation, but it is as noticeable as at the beginning of the dispute that there is no tendency towards suspending wages negotiations in other industries. Other industries, in fact, appear to be proceeding on their own lines towards a settlement of their own affairs, without reference to prospects as regards the termination of the coal dispute, or to the kind of settlement which may be reached.The period of strain following upon the introduction of the first half of the wages reductions agreed upon in the shipbuilding trades has now been got over. The electricians have resumed work, and the attitude of engineers is no longer aggressive. The resumption of negotiations with regard to the shipyard joiners&apos; dispute, though it is at the moment without success, is important. The strike of ships&apos; stewards and allied workers has not been complete, even within the union, and the Ministry have been approached on the matter by the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation. In the cotton textile industry the most noticeable fact with regard to the progress of the negotiations on the question of wages reductions is the tendency towards joint working of the various amalgamations concerned. The trade unions connected with the engineering trades put before Sir David Shackleton on the 20th May their suggestion that a Court of Inquiry under Part II of the Industrial Courts Act should be set up for their industry.The annual meeting of the Co-operative Congress concluded at Scarborough on the 18th May. A general feature of the proceedings was the way in which the delegates seized upon any point having a political flavour, sometimes almost to the total exclusion of the purely co-operative point of view which used so severely to be kept to the front. The conferences of the Electrical Trades Union and of the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives have been concluded, while that of the Railway Clerks&apos; Association opened at Bournemouth on the 23rd May.The operation of the Profiteering Acts, 1919, as amended and extended by the Profiteer-ing (Amendment) Act, 1920, ceased on the 19th May.   .The Unemployment Position.Statistics.-Oh the 13th May, in, the United Kingdom, 1,951,074 unemployment books under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers totally unemployed, of which 1,425,924 were lodged by males and 525,150 by females. At the same date 1,132,270 unemployment books and but-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers on short time, of which 562,822 were lodged by males and 569,448 by females.These figures show an increase on the previous week of 73,963 totally unemployed and 25,957 working short time.The total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom Oh the 20th May was 2,070,100. The above are advance figures provided by the Employment Department and are subject to revision.A full analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 455.
features of the week.General Topics.Sympathetic Action by Trade Unions in Support of the Miners.-There has been very-little development in the situation with regard to the embargo placed on foreign coal. Joint meetings of the executives of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation and of the National Union of Railwaymen were held on the 18th and 20th May ; but no new action was taken. This suggests that there is not now any desire on the part of the railwaymen&apos;s and transport workers&apos; leaders to engineer a general sympathetic strike movement. The following details relate to the more significant local events with regard to this topic.It is announced that the Glasgow and West of Scotland Council of the National Union of Railwaymen have definitely repudiated the limitation of the embargo to coal, and have instructed their members to cease handling any kind of merchandise from Glasgow Harbour. The Parliamentary Committee of the Scottish Trades Union Congress have written to Mr. Cramp and Mr. Williams, declaring that &quot; to relieve the untenable position of the transport workers in Scotland the only solution is to declare a national stoppage.&quot; Railwaymen in various parts of the country, notably at Tondu in South Wales, Langwith Junction in Derbyshire, and Glasgow, have been suspended as a result of their refusal to handle imported coal. Members of the National Union of General Workers employed at the Norwich gas works have declared a strike, and refused to discharge or carbonise foreign coal. The engineering staff are doing volunteer work and, at the moment, work is&apos;being-continued. The strike of employees at the London County Council power station at Greenwich still continues, but the ballot of London County Council tramwaymen on the question of sympathetic action resulted in a majority against such action being taken.The Investment Committee of the Amalgamated Engineering Union have lent the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association the sum of  50,000, free of interest for the first six months. Many of the miners&apos; county associations are now in serious financial difficulties, and are being forced to reduce the amount of benefits to the members. In Leicestershire the payments to the miners have been reduced from half rate to quarter rate, and in Nottinghamshire payments are to be made at half rate in the form of coupons.Shops Acts, 1912 to 1920. The Home Secretary received a deputation from the Early Closing Association, together with representatives of several bodies of retail traders, on the 23rd May, with regard to the expiry, on the 31st December next, of the Shops (Early Closing) Act, 1920, which continues in force the Order made in 1917 under the Defence of the Realm Act, requiring shops, with certain exceptions, to be closed by 9 p.m. on Saturday and by 8 p.m. on other days. Sir Kingsley Wood introduced the deputation, arid explained that the Early Closing Association had consulted with the opponents of their Bill,* intro-duced into the House of Commons last year, and had agreed with them to request the Home Secretary to make the present hours permanent. In view of this agreement, the Home Secretary stated that he was in a position to promise that the Act of 1920 would not be allowed to expire without something being done, either by means of a separate Bill or through the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill.The British Legion. With reference to the conference of this body held in London on the 14th May, an account of which was given in last week&apos;s issue of this Report, details have now been received of some of the resolutions adopted with regard to the policy of the Legion. The two most important resolutions are those declaring that &quot; the policy of the Legion is to ensure for ex-Service men the right to work, or maintenance at full trade union rates &quot; ; and demanding &quot; substitution of ex-Service men for women, where possible, in. Government departments, the removal of all non ex-Service men who entered Government service during the war, and the compulsory adoption of the King&apos;s Scheme.&quot;International ship owners and Seamen&apos;s Conference.-Mention has already been made in this report of the international conference of shipowners and seamen held at Brussels, in January this year, to discuss hours of labour on board ship, and of the setting up by the* The Shops (Early Closing) Bill (H.C. Bill 8), introduced on the 13th February, 1920, by Mr. Briant, and to be distinguished from the Shops (Early Closing) (No. 2) Bill, which became the Shops (Early Closing) Act, 1920. The former Bill provided, inter alia, for the adoption of 8 p.m. on Saturday and 7 p.m. on other week days, as the general hours for closing shops.i See this Keport, Vol. Ill, No. 6, 5th February, p.. 122.(B 17365T) 3 L 2
* For the meetings on the 1st and 2nd March, see this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 12,19th March, pp, 272 and 273.f The draft constitution of the Alliance was approved by both the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress at their meetings last year.conference of two commissions, to examine and report upon the technical details involved, one commission dealing with deck and engine-room staffs and the other with general service staffs.The commission dealing with deck and engine-room staffs resumed its sessions in London on the 26th and 29th April. * With regard to the application of the proposed hours to.engine-room and stokehold staffs, Commander Walton and Father Hopkins, who are representatives of owners and seamen, respectively, presented the statistical statements which they had been asked to prepare, and M. Damm, secretary of the International Seafarers&apos; Federation, gave a further explanation of the seamen&apos;s proposals, particulars of which are not yet available. It was agreed, to apply the scheme experimentally on nine vessels, three to be selected from those on which the number of firemen and trimmers would be decreased, three from those on which there would be no change, and three from those on which an increase would be necessary. With regard to the application of the proposed hours to deck staffs, a statistical table dealing with costs was presented, comparing the manning of ships under the two-watcli system with that under a three-watch system.  The commission adjourned indefinitely.Industrial and Other Organisations.Co-operative Congress. The fifty-third annual Co-operative Congress was held at Scarborough on the 16th, 17th, and 18th May. The new president, Mr. George Major, of Masborough, delivered the presidential address, in wdiich, after reminding the delegates that the ideal of the movement was the establishment of a Co-operative Commonwealth, he proceeded to discuss the steps essential to the speedy realisation of this ideal, dealing, inter alia, with the relations between the movement and the municipalities and the State.The most important resolutions adopted were those dealing with Ireland, unemploy-ment, and the question of a Labour and Co-operative Alliance. The Irish question was taken on the first day. Sir Horace Plunket took part in the discussion and the resolution passed expressed the sympathy of the Congress with co-operators in Ireland, called upon the Government to investigate immediately, by means of an impartial inquiry, the whole of the circumstances attending the destruction of co-operative, properties in Ireland, and affirmed the principle of Treasury compensation.With regard to unemployment, a resolution, submitted on behalf of the Central Board, was carried on the second day, with little discussion, stating that the Congress viewed the growing volume of unemployment with the gravest apprehension, and considered the measures so far proposed by the. Government as altogether inadequate to meet the situation. The Government was called upon to provide subsistence to all genuinely unemployed, and to take early steps to prevent further increases in the cost of living by establishing control of trade monopolies, trusts and combines, and by prohibiting unduly large profits. The resolution further demanded the restoration of European trade by the removal of $1 artificial restrictions, and by the granting of assistance to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe so that their financial position might be stabilised. It also affirmed the principle that co-operative methods of industry will alone enable the country to deal satisfactorily and permanently with the evils of unemployment.The discussion on the proposed Labour and Co-operative Alliance also took place on the second day. A decision had been postponed from last year&apos;s Congress to this in order that the question might be fully considered by the affiliated bodies. Early in the debate there was evidence of a sharp division of opinion on this very controversial question. The terms of the proposed alliancef provide that the membership should consist of the affiliated organisations of the Labour Party, the Trades Union Congress and the Co-operative Party, the object being to co-ordinate the activities of the Labour and Co-operative movements in respect of representation in Parliament and on local administrative bodies, and to support one another in respective and combined etf orts to set up a new social order with the ultimate object of establishing a Co-operative Commonwealth.Mr-. S. F. Perry, secretary of the Co-operative Party, on behalf of the National Com-mittee, moved a resolution that the Congress accept the constitution of the alliance. In answer to the objection that the Labour Party wanted their money, he.explained that there was not a word in the Constitution of the alliance which authorised the Co-operative
Party to hand over a single penny of their funds to the trade union and Labour movement. The national committee of the Co-operative Party were convinced by actual experience in Parliament that only by active co-operation with their friends of the trade union and Labour movement could they attain the objects they desired.On behalf of 47 northern societies, Mr. G. Riddle, of Carlisle, moved an amendment, declaring that the identification of the co-operative movement in politics with any one particular political party would weaken the movement, and asking the Congress to decline to ratify the terms of the proposed alliance. The amendment expressed the opinion that it was essential that the Co-operative Party should be directly represented in Parliament and on all local governing bodies, and proposed the appointment of a special committee to draft a statement of co-operative political policy and a definite political programme for submission to societies by the end of the year.The amendment, on being put to the Congress, was defeated by 1,953 to 1,199 votes. The resolution in favour of the alliance was also lost, by four votes only, 1,682 voting in favour and 1,686 against. The effect of the vote, therefore, is that the co-operative movement remains where it was before the political alliance with Labour was proposed, and retains its independence.Other resolutions before the Congress dealt with the questions of &quot; anti-dumping legislation &quot; ; the postponement of the operation of certain clauses of the Education Act, 1918 ; the position of the Co-operative Press ; international trading ; propaganda ; the appointment of a full-time executive ; relations with Russia ; and the question of opposing the Corporation Profits Tax. With regard to the last, it was decided to continue to resist the tax, and delegates agreed that there was some chance that this policy of opposition would be successful.The Congress closed with an address from the chair, in which the president appealed, particularly, for a strengthening of the International Co-operative Alliance, as likely to prove one of the greatest obstacles to the outbreak of future wars., Trade Union Conferences. The annual conference of the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives has now been concluded. The chief feature of the final sessions was the discussion on the relative merits of piece-work as opposed to day-work, and a resolution was eventually passed by 65 votes to 45, declaring in favour of abolishing the piece-work system and substituting a guaranteed daily wage, based on quantity statements. The Leicester delegates supported piece-work and the Northampton delegates day-work. A further resolution in favour of equal pay and opportunity for men and women within the industry was defeated by a large majority. ;At the conference of the Electrical Trades Union, a resolution was adopted by the delegates approving the principle of amalgamation with kindred unions. There was also a long discussion on the question of wages reductions, but the conference arrived at no decision. Various decisions concerning the administration of the union were made; among others, that the principle of a full-time Executive Council should be adopted, and that arrangements should be made for area administration, with local full-time officials.:The Railway Clerks&apos; Association opened their annual conference at Bournemouth on the 23rd May. The first session was devoted to a discussion of the efforts which&apos; are to be made by the association to secure, under the new Railways Bill, protective clauses regarding all existing superannuation rights, the provision of a new superannuation fund for new entrants, the granting of a locus standi for trade unions before the amalgamation tribunal under the grouping scheme, the appointment of labour representative tribunals, and adequate compensation for dismissal or detrimental changes in the position of existing servants of the companies.The annual conference of the National Association of Head Teachers was held at Newcastle from the 18th to the 20th May, and was attended by delegates representative of over 7,000 head teachers. yTrade Union Amalgamations. It is announced that negotiations for the amalgamation of the National Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Union and the British Seafarers&apos; Union have been reopened, and are proceeding satisfactorily. \ It will be remembered that in January, 1921 ( negotiations broke down as a result of hostility between the two unions.*It is also reported that efforts to secure closer co-operation are being made by the Actors&apos; Association, the Amalgamated Musicians&apos; Union, and the National Association of Theatrical Employees, but it is understood that the Variety Artistes&apos; Federation are not in favour of the proposals in question.f_. ____&apos;* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 4, 22nd January, p. 73.f In this connection the resolution on this subject adopted by the Scottish Trades Union Congress this year is of interest.  See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 19, 7th May, p. 398.
NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Shipyard WorkersEngineers. At Liverpool a ballot vote of the Liverpool branch of the Amalgamated Engineering Union was taken on the 14th May, and resulted in a majority of 115 in favour of acceptance of the reduction in wages proposed by the Liverpool and Mersey Ship Repairers&apos; Federation. The Mersey branch of the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades are taking a local ballot on the reductions, but the result is not yet known.Railwaymen (National). With reference to the agreement arrived at on the 3rd May between the railway companies and the three unions concerned, namely, the National Union of Railwaymen, the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, and the Railway Clerks&apos; Association, with regard to the machinery for the future regulation of wages and working conditions, * the joint committee composed of two representatives of each of these unions and six representatives of the General Managers&apos; Committee of the Railway Clearing House, met in London on the 20th May to work out details of a scheme for giving effect to the agreement. Considerable progress is reported to have been made, and the committee adjourned until the 30th.Cotton Textile Workers (Lancashire and Yorkshire). A special representative meeting of the Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners and Twiners was held in Manchester on the 17th May. It was decided to take a ballot of the whole of the members on the question of the proposed wages reductions,f and to leave the negotiations in the hands of the executive.   The ballot is expected to be completed by the 28th May.The Master Cotton Spinners and Manufacturers&apos; Association met the Northern Counties Textile Trades Federation on the 18th May! to discuss the position, mainly as it affects weavers. The operatives stated that they could not accept the employers&apos; proposals and it was agreed that the meeting should be adjourned to a date to be mutually arranged.On the 24th the cardroom amalgamation held their adjourned joint conference with the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations, Ltd.,.f when their considered reply was made to the statement of the employers&apos; case. The meeting was adjourned to a date to be fixed.It is announced that a meeting of operatives&apos; delegates representing all sections of the industry, including weavers, is to be held in Manchester on the 25th May.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Coal Miners (National). The position is much the same as it was last week. Formal negotiations have not yet been reopened, but various unofficial meetings and &quot; conversations &quot; are understood to have taken place.A meeting of the Central Committee of the Mining Association was held on the 20th May, after which a statement was issued to the effect that, if the miners were prepared to give up the idea of the pool, the owners would be fully prepared to resume discussions with the miners&apos; representatives.On the 23rd Mr. Arthur Henderson, M.P., secretary of the National Labour Party, and Mr. C. W. Bowerman, M.P., secretary of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, held a conference with Mr. Hodges in London.A suggestion is being made in some quarters that it should be made a condition for the renewal of negotiations that an &quot; amnesty &quot; should be granted all officials and others who have been imprisoned during the course of the dispute, and that all transport workers who have been suspended should be reinstated.!* See this Eeport, Vol. Ill, No. 21, 21st May, p. 432 footnote.I See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 21, 21st May, pp. 435 and 436; and Vol. Ill, No. 20,14th May, pp. 414 and 115.1 On the 25th May the Prime Minister invited the executives of the Mining Association and the Miners&apos; Federation to meet in joint conference at the Board of Trade on the 27th. This invitation has bsen accepted by both parties.
* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 20, 14th May, p. 416. t The title suggested is the &quot; Mercantile Caterers&apos; Guild.&quot; j See also p. 453 below.$ See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 21, 21st May, p. 433.Shipyard Workers: Joiners.-Th.e question of the shipyard joiners&apos; strike was raised at a conference of the 19th May, referred to below, between employers and trade unions in the shipbuilding trades, and, as a result, the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation met representatives of the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers in London on the 24th May, with a view to arriving at a settlement of the strike, which has lasted since the 1st December, 1920. The whole position was discussed, and the employers suggested that a joint committee should be appointed in order to investigate the contentions put forward on both sides. The representatives of the society, however, refused to adopt the suggestion, and the conference concluded, having failed to arrive at a settlement.Ships&apos; Cooks, Stewards and Others. The strike of ships&apos; cooks and stewards continues,* but the shipping companies do not appear to be experiencing any great difficulty in obtain-ing the necessary staffs either from volunteers or from those members of the National Union of Ships&apos; Cooks, Stewards, Butchers and Bakers, who are signing on at reduced rates of pay. A movement among chief and second stewards of ocean-going liners to break away from the union is reported from Liverpool, and the shipowners are to be invited to assist in forming a new guild or association for these grades.f Mr. Robert Williams, secretary of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, has been showing interest in the dispute, and has paid a visit to Southampton, where he claims to have been successful in persuading more men to come out.;fSettlements and Agreements.Shipyard Workers : Electricians.-A specially convened conference of representatives of the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation and the Federation of Engineering and Ship-building Trades was held in London on the 19th May to discuss the electricians&apos; strike.-The employers emphasised the need for arrangements made collectively being loyally observed by all parties to the negotiations, while the federation replied that the position of the Electrical Trades Union would be considered by the federation at the annual meeting at Scarborough on the 26th and 27th May. As a result, however, of the decision of the National Delegate Conference of the Electrical Trades Unions at Blackpool on the 20th May,$ a general resumption of work on the part of electricians took place on the 23rd May.Corporation Employees (Stockton-on-Tees). A strike of manual. workers employed by the Stockton-on-Tees Corporation began on the 14th May in consequence of the refusal of the Corporation to concede the rates of wages adopted by the Northumberland and Durham Provincial Council for Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services (Manual Workers). After negotiations between the parties a settlement was reached on the 18th, under which the Corporation agreed to pay  5 per man in respect of the claim for back money, and to stabilise existing rates until the 1st December next.[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Industrial Relations Departments section of the Report, pages 452 to 454.]
PART II-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.industrial relations. department.ENGINEERING, SHIPBUILDING AND ALLIED TRADES.Engineering Industry. Representatives of the engineering trades unions met Sir David Shackleton on the 20th May and reported a threatened dispute in the engineering industry as a result of the breakdown of the conference with the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations on the subject of reduction in wages. Sir David stated that the employers&apos; view would be obtained.Optical Instruments. The Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee met in London on the 11th May. The employers announced that, in view of the attitude of the Amalgamated Engineering Union towards a reduction in wages, they had decided to postpone further action for a month. The question of appointing a secretary from outside the Ministry of Labour was discussed, and both sides will consider the matter and report at the next meeting. A prolonged discussion took place on the question of reorganisation in the industry, and it was decided that a representative of the Amalgamated Engineering Union should invite Mr. G. D. H. Cole to address the next meeting of the Committee on the 8th June.Electrical Workers on Railways. An application was made by the National Union of Railwaymen before the Industrial Court that the agreement dated the 18th January, 1921, for electricity supply undertakings in the District Council No. 10 (Greater London) Area for the Electricity Supply Industry should be extended, with certain variations, to men similarly employed in the generating stations and sub-stations on railways in Great Britain. An application was made by the railway companies that no change should be made in Industrial Court Awards Nos. 414 and 416.*The Court decided that no alteration should be made in the settlement under Award No. 542 in the case of men employed on work generally done by contractors.! The men employed by the railway companies in electricity generating stations and sub-stations, and on high tension cables between generating stations and sub-stations, in the London district should be paid the rates set out in the schedule of the agreement referred to above, less the amount of the agreed difference between the rates of electrical workers on railways and those of similar classes employed by electricity supply undertakings, in respect of the special privileges of railway workers. The rates in centres outside the London district should remain as determined by Award No. 416. The Court approved the adoption of certain clauses of the agreement relating to the setting up of machinery to negotiate on wages matters, with a reference to the Industrial Court in the event of disagreement. Certain clauses having reference to the conditions in electricity supply undertakings were considered not properly applicable to railway companies, while others were considered wholly or in part applicable. The Court considered that, where there was an appreciable difference between the responsibility of similar classes of workpeople in large and in small stations or sub-stations, recognition should be given by a difference in rate of pay or otherwise. They were not satisfied that the other general conditions were uniform enough to make desirable the proposed extended classification on the basis of kilowatt capacity alone. The stations should be considered on an individual basis. With regard to a claim for 14 days&apos; holiday with pay, Award No. 416 should be adhered to. No decision was given on the question.of the adoption of a particular system for promotion. As regards higher grade working, the Court, acting on the assumption that the existing practice in the matter would be continued, did not consider it necessary to give any formal direction. The award was to become effective, as regards any alterations of rates and conditions, as from the beginning of the first pay period following.the 19th May... (Award No. 648.)...A similar decision was given on a similar claim made by the Electrical Trades Union, which, however, was confined to the London area.   (Award No. 649.)* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 6, 7th August, p. 227. f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 23, 4th December, p. 636.
BUILDING AND WORKS OF CONSTRUCTION.Building.-The Education Committee of the Industrial Council met on the 12th May It was decided to ask the Training Department of the Ministry to assist the Council in following up the local joint conferences which are being held in order to set up local apprenticeship committees. It transpired in the course of the discussion that, although a considerable number of conferences have been held, the results are not so satisfactory as was anticipated. Difficulty is being encountered, partly owing to local apathy, and partly because of the difficulty of obtaining an adequate number of speakers to do propa-ganda work. It was decided to convene a joint conference of the committee and the Apprenticeship Council for the Plumbing Trade in order to discuss suitable measures of co-operation. A deputation was nominated to proceed to South Wales at a convenient opportunity to attempt to smooth out certain difficulties between the South Wales master builders and the local education authorities, which are hindering the application of the scheme.MINING AND QUARRYING.Quarrying. The Chalk Sectional Council met on the 10th May to consider the replies from the constituent bodies to a proposal submitted by a previous meeting that, as regards the Thames and Medway area, the last advance of Ihd. per hour be withdrawn, and the agreement, as altered, be current for a further period of at least three months, and until the expiry of one month&apos;s notice, to be given by either side at any time after two months&apos; currency of the agreement.The unions reported that their members were prepared to accept a reduction of l\d. per hour, for a period of three months, on condition that the employers undertook to reduce their selling prices by an equivalent sum. The employers reported that the Chalk Quarrying Association were not prepared to accept the recommendation for a period of three months. After the chairman had indicated that the cement industry had decided to maintain the present rate of wages until the 7th July, and that the cement manufacturers, who also quarried chalk and manufactured whiting, would be placed in a difficult position, it was decided that wages should be reduced by l\d. per hour as from the 12th May, and that the agreement should hold good until the 27th July.TRANSPORT.Ships&apos; Stewards. Reports have been received from various sources which indicate that vessels are leaving ports all round the coast with full crews. The department have been approached by the president of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation for an interview. Informal inquiries have been made of the secretary of the National Maritime Board, to ascertain whether the Board would be prepared to arrange a further joint meeting with the cooks and stewards, either through the catering panel or by the full Board.POTTERY AND RUBBER.Rubber Manufacturing. Further efforts have been made recently to re-constitute the National Joint Industrial Council. The feelings of the employees&apos; side have been sounded through one of their representatives, and, in view of the information obtained from them, the employers&apos; side are being approached regarding the advisability of a joint conference in the hear future.PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND PUBLIC UTILITY SERVICES.Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services, Manual Workers (England and Wales).-The Provincial Council for Northumberland and Durham met on the 13th May. It was stated that certain local authorities on the Tees intend to apply to the National Council for permission to set up a Tees-side branch of that Council. The Provincial Council resolved to request the National Council not to accede to this wish. A new scheme for assessing wages, brought forward by the Grading Committee, was discussed. The scheme provides for the adjustment of wages according to the rise or fall in the cost-of-living index figure.Meetings of the Provincial Council for Kent, Surrey and East and West Sussex, and of the Executive Committee of that Council, were held on the 5th May. The Council have transformed their schedule of fixed minimum rates of pay for male manual workers into a sliding scale adjustable according to the cost-of-living index number.  The trade union(b 17365T) 3M
general department.TRADE BOARDS.PROCEEDINGS.Coffin Furniture and Cerement Making Trade Board (Great Britain). It has been decided to ask the Minister for an opinion on the question whether the Board, would be empowered to fix minimum rates of wages to rise or fall in accordance with the cost-of-living index figure.Flax and Hemp Trade Board (Great Britain).-The Board considered the question of revoking the appointment of the Condition of Trade Committee, with a view to a reduction in the present minimum rates. Proposals for a reduction of 12J per cent, in the case of adult workers, and larger percentages in the case of young workers, were submitted by the side of the Executive Committee have submitted a scheme suggesting grading and rates of pay for skilled men employed by the local authorities. A recent decision of the &quot;Provincial Council fixed minimum hourly rates of pay for women employees of local authorities.The Provincial Council for Lancashire and Cheshire, who adjourned sine die on the 21st January, met again on the 22nd April, when it was resolved that the committee appointed to consider the standardisation of rates should be immediately convened to complete the grading scheme.A. draft scheme for the establishment of a Provincial Council for Hertfordshire was adopted on the 19th May by the drafting committee appointed by the conference of the Hertfordshire local authorities and the trade unions representing the employees in the non-trading departments of those authorities, which was held on the 9th May. The scheme is to be submitted to a further conference on the 13th June.Waterworks Undertakings. The District Council for the South-Western Area, com-prising Cornwall, Devon, Dorset and Somerset, met on the 11th May. The question of the continuance of the Council was considered. No steps having been taken by the employers&apos; side of the Council in connection, with the reappointment of representatives for the year commencing the 1st June, a provisional joint committee was appointed to maintain the existence of the Council for three months. In the meantime, the secretary of the employers&apos; side will convene a meeting of representatives of all undertakings, with, a view to their nominating representatives upon the Council for the ensuing year.Corporation Clerical, Technical and Administrative Staffs (Glasgow). Applications were made before the Industrial Court by the National Association of Local Government Officers, the National Amalgamated Workers&apos; Union, and the National Union of Clerks, for the payment as from the 1st March, 1920, of the revised scale of bonus granted to civil servants in accordance with the Report of the Cost-of-Living Committee of the Civil &quot; Service National Council. The Court decided that the men and women concerned should, with certain exceptions, be paid a bonus on salaries at the rate provided by Award No. 101 of the Civil Service Arbitration Board, dated the 11th November 1919. The Court expressed the view that the award should remain in force for not less than six months from the effective date, namely the 1st April, 1921.  (Awards Nos. 646 and 647.)GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.Lighthouse Keepers. A constitution for a Whitley Council for the Northern Lighthouse Board (Scotland) has now been approved by the parties concerned and by the Board of Trade. This constitution is almost identical in terms with that for the Trinity House Whitley Council (England and Wales) which has been in existence for twelve months.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Industrial Relations will be found also on pages 446 to 451, 454, 455 and 459.]
General Department-continued.representatives of employers. The Board agreed to request that a representative of the Ministry of Labour attend the next meeting to discuss the question of oilers and sweepers, and other matters relating to the scope of the Board.Grocery and Provisions Trade Board (England and Wales). The Board reconsidered the minimum rates which had been fixed by them at their meetings in February and March last, but which had been referred back to them by the Minister. They resolved to reaffirm and fix such general minimum time-rates as the Minister had indicated he would be pre-pared to confirm, for certain classes of male and female workers, employed as shop assistants and porters, as defined by the Board.FIXING AND VARIATION OF MINIMUM RATES OF WAGES.Jute Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board, having withdrawn their Notice dated the 9th April, have issued a Notice of Proposal dated the 13th May, to vary general minimum time-rates and overtime rates for male and female workers.The variations in the general minimum time-rates proposed hy the Board consist of reductions of 121 Per cen*- on *ne ra*es a* Present being paid, to be operative during a period of four months from the date from which the rate is to become effective, and reductions of 20 per cent, on the present rates, to become operative after the expiry of that period.The Board have also issued a Notice of Proposal dated the 13th May to vary the general minimum piece-rates for female workers employed on hessian weaving, in the same manner as indicated above for general minimum time-rates, and they have withdrawn their Notice, dated the 9th April, relative to piece-rates for this class of workers.Tobacco Trade Board (Great Britain). The Minister has made an Order dated the 9th May, confirming overtime rates for male and female workers, as fixed by the Board, and has specified the 16th May as the date from which these rates are effective.Wholesale Mantle and Costume Trade Board (Great Britain).-Th.e Minister has made an Order, dated the 17th May, confirming general minimum time-rates, piece-work basis time-rates and overtime rates as fixed by the Board, and has specified the 23rd May as the date from which these rates are effective.INTELLIGENCE AND STATISTICS. PUBLICATIONS.Standard Time-Rates of Wages. A summary of the information in the possession of the department as to the standard time-rates of wages and hours of labour, at the 31st Decem-ber, 1920, of workpeople in various occupations and industries in the United Kingdom, has been issued as a Command Paper,* and is obtainable from H.M.

General Situation. The general position remains unchanged. The increase of unem-ployment and short time continues, and it is unlikely to be checked while the coal stoppage continues.Metis Employment.Iron and Steel. In Scotland many large firms have now entirely closed down for the duration of the coal dispute. At Bridgeton the entire staff, 415 men, of the Scottish Tube Co., Ltd., have been suspended. At Paisley there is a sudden depression in the iron-founding industry due to the wholesale cancellation of orders, while in Rutherglen practically all firms of any importance are now closed down. In the Northern Division, Sir W. G. Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co., Ltd., Durham, have closed down several departments for varying periods. At Hebburn-on-Tyne, 2,000 men are involved by the closing down of the works of Messrs. Palmer&apos;s Shipbuilding &amp; Iron Co., Ltd. Two large engineering firms at Stockton-on-Tees have closed their works for 10 days, approximately 1,600 workmen being affected. At Alfreton, in the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division, 600 workmen have been suspended at the Stanton Iron Works, which have now been closed down. Messrs. had fields, Ltd., Attercliffe, who normally employ from 4,000 to 5,000 men, have also closed their works.Heavy depression is apparent throughout the North-Western Division. The National Gas Engine Co., Ltd., Ashton-under-Lyne, have definitely closed down, throwing out of employment 1,000 men. At Barrow, Messrs. Vickers, Ltd., may close down their entire works. Several large firms employing from 1,500 to 2,000 men are closing for an extended holiday in Burnley, and claims to unemployment insurance benefit are expected from these men. In the Oldham district, industry is now seriously affected by the shortage of coal, Messrs. Platt Bros, having discharged more than 5,000 men on closing down their works.Shipbuilding and Allied Industries. The shipbuilding industry throughout the country is now seriously affected by the coal stoppage, while the joiners&apos; strike is also adversely affecting the situation. In the Clyde area the large majority of firms are either closed down or are working short time, arrangements providing only two and three days&apos; work per week. On the Tyne, Tees and Wear, the general position is the same as in the Clyde area. At Hartlepool several firms have closed down, or suspended further workers, an additional 650 men being now unemployed. In Sunderland, Messrs. J. L. Thompson &amp; Sons, Ltd., have suspended 850 men for an indefinite period. An increase in the numbers of unem-ployed men is expected, as many firms are using up all their available supplies of material.In Wales, the adverse effect of the depression in trade becomes more apparent day by day. In Swansea, practically all work in this industry is at a standstill. Throughout the division there are no immediate prospects of improvement, and workers are now employed only intermittently. At Newport, however, one ship-repairing firm have work to last several weeks.Textile and Clothing. Reports from the various centres indicate no improvement in the position. Many firms previously on systematic short time have now entirely closed down. In the boot and shoe trade a number of firms have a considerable amount of work, but the shortage of fuel is causing grave anxiety. The cotton and woollen trades are now feeling the full effects of the coal stoppage, and in the Bacup area about 85 per cent, of the mills are closed indefinitely, while at Batley 4,000 workmen are directly affected.In spite of the fact that a few textile employers are adopting oil fuel for the generation of steam, unemployment in these industries generally is on the increase, and an improve-ment cannot apparently be hoped for until a settlement is reached.Miscellaneous Trades.-From all centres heavy depression is reported in the chemical and dye-stuffs trade. Practically all firms engaged in the industry have closed down entirely, or have closed several departments.Messrs. Cadbury, Bros., Ltd., Bournville, are now closing their works, and about 2,000 workmen will be suspended.In the fishing industry 450 trawlers are now laid up at Grimsby, and the remainder will be unable to continue unless coal arrives very shortly. At other fishing ports large numbers of men are being dismissed and boats are being laid up.In the Metropolitan area a considerable demand for bricklayers and plasterers is reported; but in other trades the general depression is very acute, and no improvement in the situation is reported.
Women&apos;s Employment.Local Reports. The North-Western Division report that the revival in the cotton trade has received a decided setback, and that it is difficult to gauge what the position will be, even if a settlement of the industrial crisis takes place almost immediately. The tendency is to extend stoppages where short time is in operation. In certain districts, however, such as Blackburn, Darwen and Hyde, some mills are making arrangements to utilise oil as fuel.Prospects in the gray cloth section of the cotton trade at Nelson are said to be brighter than they have been for several months. This section forms two-thirds of the textile industry in this locality, and it is thought that a steady improvement would take place with the settlement of the coal strike. At Bacup and Preston the slipper industry shows no sign of improvement. The curtailment of railway facilities has had a serious effect on holiday resorts.In the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division the coal stoppage is having a disastrous effect on the staple industries. Reports of unemployment and short time are received from all the textile centres. At Todmorden the position in the cotton industry is acute, as many more firms have exhausted their coal supplies. The hosiery, lace, making-up, and clothing trades continue depressed. At Nottingham nearly 7,000 workers are totally unemployed, and over 4,000 are on short time. At Dewsbury the depressed condition of the rug and rag trade continues.  All firms are either on short time or entirely stoppedThe South Midlands and Eastern Division report a brighter outlook in the clothing and boot trade generally, but extended holidays are nevertheless being taken in the majority of staple industries.Short-time working is now said to be increasing in the London area, where the coal shortage is beginning to make itself felt. Serious unemployment continues to be reported from all factory centres, and depression continues in the dressmaking, tailoring and other needlework trades.In the West Midlands Division the metal trades are still discharging workers, and there is no prospect of revival.  The pottery trade continues at a standstill.In the South-Western Division there is slight improvement in the tailoring and dressmaking trades at Basingstoke and Devonport. Serious unemployment is reported from Plymouth and Portsmouth, the live register in each case numbering over 1,000.Wales report that there is little hope of improvement in the tinplate industry until after the coal strike is settled. The general depression is having a considerable effect on the retail trades.The Northern Division report that many married women are registering for employ-ment owing to the increasing unemployment amongst the men. These workers are mostly claiming unemployment insurance benefit in respect of the munition work which they did during the war. In these cases the claims are being reviewed by the Local Employment Committees.Scotland report that the effects of the coal shortage are becoming very pronounced. Many firms are closing down, more especially those in the textile trades, and ropery firms. Seasonal domestic work in the Highlands is said to be entirely stopped owing to travelling restrictions.DISCHARGED AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.national scheme-TJ]) to and including the 17th May, 25,401 certificates have been issued to employers under the scheme. The undertakings given by these employers cover 280,836 disabled ex-Service men. - - n.; ;During the last month, 132 disabled men have been placed in employment in the North-Western Division.  The Divisional Controller, however, is of the opinion that very little ; can be accomplished until the miners&apos; dispute is settled and industry, in general, begins to revive.. [Reference to matters of interest to the Employment and Insurance Department will also -be found on pages 446 to 448, 453 and 459.]
appointments and training.APPOINTMENTS AND CIVIL LIABILITIES DEPARTMENT,APPOINTMENTS.Statistics.-During the week ending the 13th May the department placed 298 candidates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 54,795. Of these 7,157 have been placed through the agency of the department^ Interviewing Boards. Applications were registered from 613 ex-Service men and 26 civilians. The number of candidates available for appointments on the 13th May was 11,395 ex-Service men and 1,258 civilians. At the same date 837 &quot; live &quot; vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 358 having been registered during the week.BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.Business Training Scheme. During the week ending the 13th May, the department received 5 applications for training under this scheme, bringing the total number of appli-cations to 3,284, of which 1,847 have since been cancelled. Grants have been sanctioned in 748 cases. At the same date 291 vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 9 having been registered during the week.Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The department have dealt with a total of 1,201 cases, in 526 of which the training sanctioned is provided by the Appointments Department, and in the remainder by other Government Departments. Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour&apos;have completed training in 334 cases, and abandoned training in 45 ; 118 are still in training, and 29 are awaiting training.TRAINING DEPARTMENT.INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men.^Statistics. On the 17th May, 24,326 men were in training, as against 24,351 on the 10th May, and 24,352 on the 19th April. During the week, 325 men were placed in training. There were 16,343 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 10th May and the 19th April being 16,455 and 16,847. The number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 31,811, the totals for the 10th May and the 19th April being 31,491 and 30,114. Including the 11,000 men who completed training under the Ministry of Pensions, the total number of men dealt with under Government training schemes is rapidly approaching 70,000.Government Instructional Factories. During April the most satisfactory developments have been the institution of new training college schemes, and the improvement, in certain areas, of the general position with regard to the building trades. There is a general con-sensus of opinion that the coal dispute and trade depression are responsible for the set-back in training progress, and little advance can be expected until there is a definite improvement in industrial conditions. Some economies are being effected through the closure of factories in certain areas, and the transfer of men to other factories in which there are still a number of vacant places.There has been an increase of 132 in the number of men in training in Government Instructional Factories, the total now reaching 11,050, an increase of over 1,000 since the beginning of February.Good progress is reported from Luton. The painting and decorating classes are engaged in work on the various buildings of the factory; the plumbers have been carrying out adaptations and improvements and have thereby gained valuable experience in hot-water systems; while the carpenters and joiners are constructing doors and window frames. At the Guildford Factory the carpentry class have contracts in hand for adaptations to the factory to the value of nearly  400. At Bristol cash sales during April amounted to nearly  400, and there were contracts in hand at the end of the month to the value of over  800. At the Woodhouse Lane Factory, Leeds, there were contracts in hand at the close of the month to the value of nearly  2,700.
Appointments and Training-continued.National Trade Advisory Committees : Gold, Silver and Allied Trades. At a meeting on the 10th May, a resolution from the Bristol Local Technical Advisory Committee recommending the extension of training in watch and clock repairing was considered. It was unanimously resolved that the committee were unable to recommend to the depart-ment an extension of training.Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics. Up to the 18th May, agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 46,318 apprentices, under 41 schemes approved. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 44,185 apprentices, employed by 17,584 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 24,856.Period of Renewed Training. Local headquarters for the South-Western area report that the insistence of the dockers&apos; and general workers&apos; trade unions on a seven years&apos; apprenticeship for fitters in the sash and casement industry is much more pronounced than that of the craft unions. At the works of Messrs. Gardiner, Sons and Co., Ltd., Bristol, the journeymen members of the dockers&apos; union maintained that apprentices should not be allowed to work on their own until they had completed a seven years&apos; apprenticeship, less the time allowed under the Interrupted Apprenticeship Scheme. This has been ob-served by the firm hitherto, but under existing trade conditions they find it impossible to continue to make the &quot; out-of-office &quot; payments involved to apprentices whose period of State assistance has terminated. The journeymen have now agreed to the &quot; out-of-office &quot; payments being reduced, and to apprentices being given jobs of their Own as soon as trade improves.Unemployment. The condition of trade precludes all possibility of dealing with un-mated cases,, or the placing elsewhere of apprentices who have been suspended on account of shortage of work.Institutional Training. Local headquarters for the London and South Eastern area report that the London County Council have stated their willingness to set up the necessary classes to absorb apprentices who have applied for institutional training. It is hoped to arrange for their commencement shortly.General Training.Apprenticeship : Building. The national scheme was explained to a meeting of dele-gates of employers and operatives at Southend on the 3rd May, and it was decided to establish an apprenticeship committee. Until a few weeks ago, the feeling between the two sides was distinctly hostile, mainly owing to the attitude of the operatives. Similar joint conferences were held at Melton Mowbray and Peterborough, and in each instance the scheme was well received. It was agreed to refer the matter to the various associations concerned for final decision. There is every reason to believe that the scheme will be adopted.At York, the operatives have nominated representatives of, all trades for the Appren-apprenticeship Committee, but, up to the present, no nominations have been sent in by the employers.A certain amount of indifference is reported amongst employers at Stafford, more particularly those who do not belong to the employers&apos; association. The majority of builders in Stafford are apparently in a small way of business and do not, as a whole, realise the necessity for the scheme. A number of employers, however, have expressed the r appreciation of the scheme, and their desire to indenture apprentices according to its terms.[Reference to matters of interest to the Appointments and Training Departments will also be found on pages 447 and 453.]
