FRANCS!. &apos;The subsidies for tho construction and navigation of French merchant vessels ceased on 26 August 1918*Subsidies known as &quot;compensations dfarmernent&quot; are however still given.    They are allowances for the periods during which ships built under the provisions of the law of 19 April 1906, are kept running under special conditions.A credit of francs 5,800,000 (about  127,000 present value) was voted in the 1921 budget for these subsidies,POLAND.Poland has been offered ships In lieu of the gold promised by the Russian Soviet Government,ITALY.The Flotilla Leader &quot;Aquila&quot; is being re-armed.      The 3-6&quot; guns will be replaced by 5-4,7&quot; ,The Light Cruiser, &quot;Campania&quot; is fitting out for colonial service, and will replace &quot;Basilicata&quot; in the Red Sea,    She is very high between decks, and has large square portholes to provide extra ventilation.      It is stated that it will cost too,much to refit &quot;Basilicata&quot; (sunk by internal explosion at Port Said) for service, and that it is intended to build a ship similar to &quot;Campania&quot;, or to convert a merchant ship into a colonial cruiser. Armstrong Works, Pozzuoli.&quot;&quot;^B^^ms, I^r Lne^toroainl&quot; class (construction Of these ships abandonedTTlx of these guns are at these works;   two completed, and 4 nearing completion.&apos;, It is stated that these will be used for coast defence, but that so mounted they can only be loaded in a horizontal position, although the firing elevation will be increased to 37-J degrees.Fourteen 4,7&quot; (naval) are completed. Twenty 4,7&quot; twin mountings for &quot;Leone&quot; class Flotilla Leaders are completed, and a twin 6&quot; mounting is under design, vickers Works, term .Designs for&apos; a twin 4&quot; mounting for use In destroyers have been submitted and approved,Naval and private building establishments at Naples, goyal dockyard. &apos;$his yarcThas been very considerably reduced, and the,. Government are endeavouring, without success, to have it taken over by a private Company.    It presents a stagnant and Ill-kept   .. appearance;   the employees work badly, and it is run at a heavy expense.Should no private company take it over, the yard may possibly be closed,.&apos; Royal Dockyard, Castellamare.The GovernmenlThave endeavoured, without success, to arrange for this yard either to be taken over by a private company, or to be run on a Cooperative basis by the workmen.    No naval work of any sort is In hand. .   .Armstrong Works, Pozzuoli.these Splendidly equipped works have sunk to a surprisingly low ebb, the greater part of the plant Is shut down, and only about 1,000 men, all told, employed.The Italian Ideal. Battle Cruiser,it^rougE skeTcTf oi^Eis vessel reveals the following particularsDisplacement, 28,000 tons.Speed, 32 knots.Main Armament,&apos;8 14&quot; in pairs on the centre line Secondary   &quot;   16   6&quot;..... Protection.   Anti torpedo underwater Protection.Armour not yet settled. There is not tho slightest intention of building this vessel, and plans are only being prepared in case France should bogin building big ships.
ITALY (oontd,),It may be noted in this connection that, in response to requests from the French Naval Authorities for information as to future Italian construction, the Italian Naval Attache in Paris has been&quot;informed as follows,&quot;The intention is to preserve the present relative strength of the Italian Navy vis a vis that of France,  , and no big ship construction will take place unless the French Government should decide to increase the present number of their capital ships.    The relative strength is computed on the basis of France retaining in effect-ive service the 3 ships of the &quot;Bretagne&quot; class, and 4 ships of the &quot;Jean Bart&quot; class, while Italy maintains the 2 ships of the &quot;Dftllio&quot; class, the 2 of the &quot;Glulio Cesare&quot; class, and the &quot;D,Alighierl&quot;. Adriatic,*&quot;*^,S,AfrSquadr on.ITsTIali Naval Authorities are concerned at the continued presence of U.S,A, warships in the Adriatic, and especially at the maintenance of a U.S.A, guardship, usually a destroyer, at Spalato, which involves an Italian ship remaining there also,U.S,Cruiser &quot;Olympia&quot; has left the Adriatic for Gibraltar and will not return.The U.S, S,N,0, at Spalato has informed the Italian S.N.0, there that two of the four U,S,A. destroyers are leaving for home almost immediately. Of the remaining two, one will alwayshe at Spalato, and the other at Venice^ Pola or Trieste, or, occasionally, at Fiume,    The Italian   S,N.O. could not obtain any approximate date for the departure of these two ships, which are, apparently, being retained for propaganda and economic purposes.The u\S.A. authorities appear anxious to induce as many Jugo Slav seamen (especially those of the ex Austro-Hungarian Fleet) to go to the United States,TURKEY,   .The High Commissioners at Constantinople do not-consider that Greek warships can be refused right of passage through the neutral zonetUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,A Bill has been introduced into Congress by Representative Butler, &quot;of Pennsylvania, for the creation of an auxiliary reserve to the Navy,    Under this Bill the Government will enrol all of the officers and men in the merchant fleet in the reserve, and will pay the members a retainor.    The officers will get one month1s base pay, while the unenlisted personnel will be given $180 a month. It is known that the American Shipowners are preparing to give this bill their fullest support., in an effort to have it enacted Into law during the present special Congress.    At the present time they think that this would be the most popular form of subsidy, However they declare that the pay to the men should be 0240 instead of $180,    Under the Butler Eill the officers and men would not be removed from their posts on the merchant ships, but instructors from the Navy would be placed on board9    Thus, the commercial operations of the ships would not be interfered with in putting the system into effect.    The shipowners think that this aid will be helpful, because the officers and sailors, with this bonus, can be signed on at a lower wage than otherwise,
JAPAN *The Japanese 2nd Foreign Service Squadron, consisting of &quot;KASTJGA&quot; and &quot;NIITAKA&quot; , is reported by the press to have been abolishedo    The report is confirmed by the fact that the Vice-Admiral Commanding and all his Staff have been given other appointments to date 1st April without relief.This Squadron was in tho past kept in the Southern Waters of the China StationaIt is reported in the press that the Japanese Naval Detachment at Tslngtao has been withdrawn as from the 1st April, This is confirmed by the fact that the officer commanding has beer given another appointment without relief.

The police were finally forced to shoot and 7 persons were killed and about 47 wounded.The British troops have not yet been called out except in Alexandria where an armoured car patrolled the town and some troops appeared in the streets for a short time but did not fire or take any active part.MESOPOTAMIA.A recrudescence of rebellious activity is reported amongst certain tribes in the Nasiriya and Mosul areas and in both cases they have been subjected to aerial attack.    Attacks have been suspended to give the insurgent tribes time to come in and submit to Government terms *Fourteen Q?itish Officers are serving with the Persian forces in Gilan and seven more are expected.Considerable progress is being made with the re-organisation of the Persian Army. , The British forces before evacuating Persia handed over, to the Persian Government a considerable quantity of military stores including 6 8 pdr. guns,12 machine gunes, 44: Lewis&apos; guns, and 328 rifles&apos; and a large quantity.of ammunition for both guns and rifles.....:,z: , ;:V^- c ^russia.I .\      &apos;        &apos;     &apos;       &apos;Trans-C aucas ia.The Trans-Caucasian Republics of Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia have concluded.a:railway convention to allow of the free use of railways and exchange of commodities. ,Petroleum exports . have commencing  ed from Bat burn to -Constantinpple.v    ;^ /     ,     1 ;Caspian. , ,       &apos; , 1    .     &apos;    * , Kussian.trbops from (lilan front have been re^embarkedfrom Enzelij    Azerbaijanians have taken their place.

The dissolution of the Parliament has been postponed.    Steps are being taken to form a new Government and all is quiet at present.The resignation was due to the demand of the Republican Guard backed up by certain regiments.    It appears that the Minister of War was engineering a coup d!etat to restore the Prime Minister to the Presidency.GREECE.The political situation is very uncertain and Insecure, and there Is an universal feeling of depression, anxiety and discontent with the present Government,The policy of the French in the Greco-Turkish conflict is changing, as they are evidently apprehensive of the issue of the operations in Anatolia, fearing a breakdown of the Greek army and a sweeping nationalist success.    They fear also that their agreement with the Nationalists will not, go through, and therefore wish to keep in with the Greeks as a form of re-insurance.    The, French Government state that they have taken steps to prevent any war material being supplied to Greeks or Kemallsts,TURKEY.. The release has not yet been effected of the British prisoners of war in Nationalist hands, who were to be exchanged . for the Turkfch prisoners of war recently released from Malta,The Angora telegraph agency- announces in Its issue of May 17th the resignation of the Angora Cabinet,Everything points to the existence of considerable tension in pclitleal circles at Angora, -and there seems no reason to doubt that victory still lies, with the extremists.
