This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.SECRET.CP. 2965.w r i e\ c?THE CABINET.IRELAND.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.With reference to my memorandum of to-day on &quot;Ireland and the General Military Situation &quot; (CP. 2964), I circulate a memorandum by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, enclosing two minutes, marked &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B,&quot; by the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in Ireland.L. W.-E.The War Office,Uth May, 1921.MEMORANDUM BY THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF. S. of S,I attach a memorandum, marked &quot; A,&quot; by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Ireland, giving in outline the action he would take, were it decided by the Cabinet to make a supreme effort in Ireland this summer to re-establish law and order.I agree, in the main, with General Macready&apos;s proposals, and I do not think it is possible at the present date to define in more detail than he has done the course of operations to be pursued. Neither General Macready nor I can promise any definite result; all we can say is that if it is made clear to England and Ireland that the Government is determined to settle this matter this summer, if all Ireland (except the six Ulster counties) is placed under Martial Law and thereby not only all the soldiers but all the Police and Auxiliaries come under one command, if the Navy give all the assistance they possibly can in watching and guarding the coasts, and if active and intense propaganda on our side be undertaken both in England and Ireland, if all these things are done, we shall run a much better chance of reaching success than we now have under our present plans.I attach a second memorandum, marked &quot; B,&quot; drawn up by General Macready on the military outlook under our present regime. With all he says I am in cordial agreement, and I need not therefore repeat the points and arguments he brings forward,I hope the Government will consider these two papers with all the attention they merit, and decide now as to their future action in Ireland so that, in the event of our proposals being adopted, we may take the necessary steps at once to carry out the Government^ wishes, and, in the event of these not being adopted, we may lay our plans for carrying out such reliefs as are within our power, and of getting the troops gradually settled down in their permanent quarters where regular training may be carried out, and where officers and men, so far as it is possible, may be joined by their wives and families.Henry Wilson, Chief of the Imperial General Staff.;   24th May, 1921. \(B2L/198)  100  5/21  h&amp;s, Ltd. 9226-3wo
MEMORANDUM &quot;A&quot; BY THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, THE FORCES INIRELAND.C.I.G.S.,I understand that under certain conditions it may be possible for you to reinforce the troops under my command iri Ireland with, say, 20 Battalions of Infantry, 8 Regiments of Cavalry, and a certain proportion of armoured cars, wireless personnel, and aeroplanes, in the event of the Government deciding to throw the whole of the forces at their disposal into Ireland in order to take the greatest 1 possible advantage of the weather during the summer and early autumn. Should this decision be reached, it will, of course, be necessary that the Navy should equally throw the whole of their available weight into the scale. The activity of the troops at present serving in Ireland is directed towards countering the pressure of the Irish Republican Army whenever that becomes prominent in various areas and localities, and little more than this can be done on account of insufficiency of numbers, and the consequent strain on young troops by having few nights in bed. At the present moment in certain parts of Ireland the troops are getting only two nights. Apart from little expeditions of a couple of subaltern officers and from 12 to 20 men, extending over from 24 to 48 hours, and directed against a spot where information has been received of a collection of rebels, a course of action which is taking place almost daily in different parts of the country, the only possibility of taking the offensive is with the Cavalry, and now that the weather has become suitable for mounted work, one &quot; drive &quot; has already taken place, another is about to take place, and a third on a very much larger scale is planned for the middle of June. If, however, the Government decide to take thorough and drastic action in the direction of imposing Martial Law throughout the country (omitting the six counties of Ulster) and of instituting such blockade as may be considered necessary by the authorities in Ireland, accompanied by passport regulations and residential permits, I propose to utilize the extra forces which may be placed at my disposal, broadly, in. the following manner : At least 7 Battalions, together with 3 Cavalry Regiments, would be apportioned to Munster, 9 Battalions to the 5th Division and 4 to the present Dublin District, which, as soon as the Ulster Government is formed, will extend up to Monaghan and Cavan.As regards general policy, I attach the greatest importance to &quot; showing the flag&quot; in districts where there are a considerable number of loyalists and people who &quot; sit on the fence.&quot; The arrival of fresh troops and the obvious determina-tion of the British Government to &quot;see the thing.through&quot; will encourage waverers and will make all except the irreconcilable extremists realize that the success of the rebels is out of the question. Until the populated districts have been quieted, I do not propose to waste force on the mountainous districts into which the extremists will fly, and who will be comparatively easily rounded up as soon as the civilized areas have settled down. Another important factor is to re-establish all police posts which have been abandoned, except those which the military authorities decide need not be re-occupied.On arrival, the new battalions will be at first located as complete units at certain centres, where they will have the opportunity of learning something about the conditions which prevail in the country and of becoming acquainted with many points, both tactical and administrative which are unknown outside Ireland. Battalions will then be moved out each into a certain area and distributed according to circumstances, but on no&apos; account will any detachment be smaller than a company. A Battalion thus distributed will cover a con-siderable area, and mobile columns from the companies will perpetually move about the district, thereby assuring that every village and farm sees the Army. All movements will be by route march or bicycles, transport only being required for baggage and supplies, but even if new battalions are not equipped with first line transport, they must, at any rate, have one cooker and one water-cart per company, water being a great difficulty in certain parts. I hope by this means to keep down extra transport to the lowest possible limit, but, of course, there are certain localities where extra transport will be required for extra troops.The role of the infantry therefore will be : (a.) To move through the country, get in touch with the inhabitants, obtain information, hearten the loyalists and depress the extremists. (b.) Assist in the re-occupation of stations vacated by the Royal Irish Constabulary, (c.) Despatch mobile columns to act against rebels who have been located.
As regards Cavalry, I propose to use the three regiments in Munster as -one force to carry out concerted movements through certain districts, and according to the information available to tackle each locality. In the 5th Divisional Area, the Cavalry would be employed in two brigades acting in the same way, either separately or together, and organisation may arise, according to information received, where the whole of the Cavalry might be turned on to one large &quot; drive.&quot; It is difficult to give a more detailed appreciation at the moment, because everything depends upon the situation at the time and the information received. The more armoured cars that can be provided, the better, as they are of great value.If the Government decide to place at my disposal all possible troops and material, every effort will be made to stamp out the extremists while the fine weather lasts, that is up to the end of September, but I am not prepared to guarantee that this object will be attained, as it is impossible to forecast with any certainty happenings which may take place in Ireland in the future.One last point I would urge, and that is that should the Government decide to take drastic steps to stamp out the rebellion now existing, efforts should at the same time be directed towards countering the rebel propaganda which is at present pursuing its course unchecked in the Press, at meetings presided over by prominent persons, and by certain members in both Houses of Parliament.C. F. N. Macready, General, Commanding-in-Chief the Forces in Ireland.23rd May, 1921.MEMORANDUM &quot;B&quot; BY THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, THE FORCES IN IRELAND.C.I.G.S.,Following the discussion we had this morning in regard to my Weekly Report, dated 14 th May, I understand that you wish to be informed as to my candid opinion in regard to the morale and feelings of the troops at present stationed in Ireland.It is extremely difficult for anyone not living in Ireland at the present time to realize the &quot; atmosphere&quot; under which officers and men are at present serving. The rank and file are in excellent health, keen on their work, and thoroughly under discipline. During the last few months, instance after instance has occurred where officers and men have been murdered by the rebels, and yet in not one single instance has there been the least attempt at outbreak or retaliation of any kind. This, I think, speaks volumes for the state of discipline in which the troops are held by their officers. I mention that the health of the troops is good, but my Deputy-Director of Medical Services is continually impressing on me that, while this is the case at present, anything in the shape of an epidemic might suddenly have a very disastrous effect among the men who are for the most part very young and &quot; fine drawn.&quot; I have on several occasions drawn attention to the number of nights in bed which in certain areas is now down to two, and this cannot be remedied except by reinforcement. While from a purely military standpoint of the well-being of the troops, the above might be considered satisfactory, I-feel impelled to point out that the situation from this point of view gives me the very greatest anxiety, because there seems to be at the present moment no definite end to the state of affairs now existing. I make it my constant endeavour to keep in as close touch as may be possible with the troops, and to discover their ideas and feelings by conversations with officers of all ranks, and I believe that the following remarks are a picture of the true facts of the case : While the rank and file are in no way discontented, there is a feeling among them that their efforts and the danger which hourly besets them are not appreciated by people in Great Britain. The idea is strengthened by the want of anti-rebel propaganda, and by what is read in the papers about Parliamentary debates and meetings held under the auspices of various influential people. The result is that the men cannot be expected to go on indefinitely without the conditions under which they are serving having effect upon their morale, discipline and future from the point of view of military usefulness.   Married men have been separated from
their wives and families for a considerable time and see no prospect of either returning to them or having them out to live with them, and the unmarried men, except in the larger cities (and there only with increased danger) are denied the usual amusements which normally exist when serving in the British Isles.As regards the officers, the strain upon them from the junior to the highest ranks is incomparably greater than it would be in time of actual war. The Lieutenant or Captain in charge of a village or post not only has the hourly danger of assassination hanging over him, but has to be at any moment prepared to come to a decision in regard to the defence of his charge, or to act on a sudden call from the Police, or to exercise his discretion in regard to setting-right complaints which are often libellous, brought to his notice by sympathizers with rebels. In addition to this, he may be continually worried to render reports in order that questions by rebel sympathizers may be answered in the House of Commons. The strain of this situation increases in proportion to the rank of the officer concerned and in the case of General Officers Commanding Divisions, more especially in the 6th Division whose headquarters are at Cork, it is often astonishing to me how the officers manage to bear up under the strain as they do.Events lately have shown that the rebels stick at nothing in order to carry out their policy of endeavouring to secure their ends by outrage and murder, under the impression that the further they go, the more chance there is that the British Govern-ment and public will be cowed into submission. At the same time, it is only right to form a clear opinion of what the effect of continued service under these conditions will be upon the troops.It is my considered opinion that the troops as at present situated will continue to do their duty during the present summer, although I am not prepared to say that, if pressed too far by the campaign of outrage directed against them, there may not be cases where they will take the law into their own hands and break out. It is difficult for the rank and file and junior officers to understand why it is that the members of Dail Eirann are left untouched by the Government, and even though Arthur Griffiths has now been under arrest for 6 months, no action is taken against him, seeing that the campaign of murder now in progress is, if not directed by the members of Dail Eirann, at all events concurred in by them. While, as I have said, I am of opinion that the troops at present in Ireland may be depended on to continue to do their best under present circumstances through this summer, I am convinced that by October, unless a peaceful solution has been reached, it will,not be safe to ask the troops to continue there another winter under the conditions which obtained during the last. Not only the men for the sake of their morale and training should be removed out of the Irish &quot;atmosphere,&quot; but by that time there will be many officers who. although they may not confess it, will, in my opinion, be quite unfit to continue to serve in Ireland without a release for a very considerable period.To sum up, it amounts to this. Unless I am entirely mistaken, the present state of affairs in Ireland, so far as regards the troops serving there, must be brought to a conclusion by October, or steps must be taken to relieve practically the whole of the troops together with the great majority of the commanders and their staffs. I am quite aware that troops do not exist to do this, but this does not alter in any way the opinion that I have formed in regard to the officers and men for whom I am responsible.C. F. N. Macready, General, Commanding-in-Chief the Forces in Ireland.23rd May, 1921.
