Men of the Inniskilling Pusiliers and another regiment.had been persistently annoyed by certain civilians in Aveley, and on May 21st some of the men set out to catch and deal with about seven of the civilians of the village who had annoyed them by impugning their loyalty and calling them Sinn -Feiners.   With this object they stopped and examined a number of people, but did not succeed in finding the men of whom they were in search.   The frequenters of the Old Ship Inn had been most prominent in the annoyance and failing to find the men they attacked the Inn.   The matter was much exaggerated in the Press, and it is believed that only one soldier was found to be under the influence of liquor.SECRETSneoisl Report
