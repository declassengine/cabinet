DISPUTE AT GREENWICH (L. C. C. TRAMWAYS) POWER STATION.

MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.

?

I think that my colleagues should be aware of the difficult situation at the Greenwich Power Station which supplies the power for the whole of the L.C.C. Tramway system. On May 9th a cargo of Belgian coal from Antwerp, which had been secured through the Council&apos;s usual contractors, arrived at the Greenwich wharf. On learning that it was foreign coal the men (members of the National Union of General Workers, the Enginemen and Firemen&apos;s Union, the Electrical Trades Union, and the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers) refused to unload it. Some of the men were suspended for refusal to unload and the coal was unloaded by the staff of the L.C.C. Electrical Department. One cargo has been unloaded and a further cargo came up m the tide yesterday (Tuesday) and is in process of being unloaded.

Conferences between the Council&apos;s Chief Electrical Engineer and the Unions have taken place at the Ministry of Labour, when the Unions took the standpoint that there was English coal available in the Thames and that this coal should be used for the purposes of a public utility service like the tramways.  They had come to the decision that either English coal must be used or the undertaking must be closed down. In this case the dispute would be confined to Greenwich. If, however, the L.C.C. decide to use foreign coal, the Unions would call out all the electricians from the Greenwich Power Station and would involve all the other power houses in London. The National Union of General Workers and the Dock, Wharf Riverside and General Workers said that they are acting under the instructions of the Executive of the Transport Workers&apos;
Federation which hae &quot;blacked&quot; all foreign coal.    The Bleotrioal Srades1 Union stated they cannot agree to work a pwor station on coal which has been &quot;blacked&quot; by another Union, and the Enginemen and Firemen are concerned in tht dispute in that they have 10,000 members in rhe coalfields involved in the miners&apos; dispute and arc consequently reluctant to do anything which looks like helping to defeat the miners.The Chief Eleotrioal gngineer made it clear that he would continue to work tho power station; that he had only altogether, including the two cargoes now on hand, a fort-nights stocks; that this was an insufficient margin and that he would bo compelled to obtain foreign ooal if no English ooal was available.Enquiries have been made of the Mines Department and it is understood that, while it is true that there are some six or seven thousand tons of English coal in the Thames, this soal is ear-marked for Gas Undertakings and Bakehouses which need a special quality of eoal and which are of a higher priority than the electrical power undertakings; the ooal is consequently not available for the Greenwich power station.In order to gain time, tho Unions were told that their suggestion that English coal is available would be explored.    They asked for a reply from the responsible Department some time to-morrow, if possible.(Signed)   T.J. M&amp;CNAMAKA.Ministry cf labour. 11, 5. 21.-
