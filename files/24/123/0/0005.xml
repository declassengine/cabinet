May 3rd, 1921.
The Office of Works are now   erecting certain sami-permanent buildings at acton which are neoring completion,      looommodation amounting to 147,000 squsre foet will, it is anticipatedi be completed by Mi&amp;suramar and the remainder, comprising 123,000 square feet, by tho end of the year or early in 1922.    The total oapaaity of the buildings would in round figures be 5,000 staff engaged on wark of a ruutino oharaoter.    The sohemo for the erection of these buildings was originally devised in order to- concentrate&quot;tho-Penrjions Issues&quot;Branch of tkG Ministry of Pensions, which at present is accommodated in the Chester Gate Huts and Cumberland Gate Huts, Re ontTs Park, and employs staff of 4,803*2.     It is understood that certain Administrative changes are proposed in the organisation of the Ministry of Pensions whioh will involve drastic reductions in the staff and whioh will consequently result.in the acton buildings boin  required only partially by the Ministry of Pensions.     This lead3 at oneo to.tho question of the possible utilisation of the Acten buildings for other staffs.3.     The present position of Government staffs and aooomme-dation in London occluding local and special offices iB as follows:-Staff.In Grown buildings. 2,762Leased Buildings.305.Building held on short or inaooure tenanoios.5,946Requisitioned Buildings.Temporary Buildings.. (In Royal Parlte and on Crown Land.   In L*OcC0Gardens, on roofa and in quadrangles, Burton Court).15,541TOTAL.60.337
4.    The nee-&apos; for releasing requisitioned buildings and temporary buildings in Parka and opan spaoes is one of considerable urgonoy, and it is clOc.r that the possibility oi accommodation for 5,000 staff unexpectedly becoming available at acton will have far-reaching effects on tho accommodation situation generally in tho central area, although there is certain to be considerable opposition from any Departments which may be doemod suitable for transfer either wholly or tn part to the acton buildings. 5,   It is felt that the most, expeditious method of investigating the relative suitability of Departmental staffs for transfer to acton would be scoured by tho appointment of a Committee consisting oi representatives of the Treasury and the Office of Works, to investigate thomatter with power to call evidence and to dotormine tho manner in which tho buildings at Acton can best be utilised. 6.   In order to determine this immediate question the Committee will inevitably have to consider to a certain extent tho question of docontralising staffs of Government Departments.   In follow of the growing pressure on central accommodation and of the public demand for the further evacuation of temporary proraisos, it is thought desirable that this Committee should bo instructed to investigate tho problem of decentralisation not meroly in it3 bearing upon acton but in its wider aspects.I therefore suggest that the Cabinet should appoint a Committee consisting of two representatives of the Treasury and two of the Office of .;orka under an independent Chairman with the following terms of roferenoe*M    g   mm
"To consider and determine as to the Department or Branches of Department to be accommodated in the new Government buildings now in course of erection at Acton.

In view of the desirability of terminating the continued occupation of the temporary buildings in the Parks and London County Council gardens, and on roofs of public buildings, and having regard to the increased cost of central accommodation, the Committee is further instructed to consider and report to the Cabinet as to the extent to which Departments or Branches of Departments now accommodated centrally might be transferred to outlying areas".
