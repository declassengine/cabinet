Copy No.0.P.-2945.CABINET.SttRVEY OP THE STATE Off IRELAND ffOR VffiJEK ENDED) 16th MAY, 1981.(circulated by tho Chief Secretary for Ireland)I submit for tho consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 16th instant. GENERAL STATE Off THE COUNTRY. Statistics of Outrages.I regret to state that tho crime statistics for the week are exceptionally bad.    No less than 60 attacks on crown Forces were committed during the week and the number of police and military casualties (55, including 23 deaths) is the highest on record for any week since the Rebellion of 1916.    Nearly one half of these oasualties occurred on the 14th instant, the day following that of the Elections for the Southern Parlia-ment and there would appear to be no doubt that they were the outcome of a long pre-arranged plan to exhibit to the world the double demonstration of Sinn ffeinJs political strength and its still unbroken power of maintaining an armed resistance to the authority of British law.    The outrages simultaneously oarried out in England were obviously part of the one general design. To describe this murder outbreak as 1 warfare&apos; is to do violence to language.      In almost every case the aot was one of deliberate oold-blooded assassination or attempted assassination.   several of the murderea men were auarmed soldiers, and of the rest the majority, although armed, were shot down without any opportunity of defending theinsalves or of attempting escape.   11 soldiers and policemen were murdered in this manner on a single day (the 14th instant) and in one case the assassination was attended by the murder of a woman.      Tho murdered lady, who was the
daughter of Sir 0harlot Barrington, D.L., a well known and , popular land-owner of Go. Limerick, was travelling with another lady in tho company of a District Inspector of tho Rcyal Irish Constabulary and a Military Officer from Killoxoully to Newport, whan thoir oar was ambushed by a party of about 20 men, who fired upon them at oloso range.    Kiss Barrington and tho District Inspector wore killed outright and the other two occupants of tho oar wore wounded.    The orgy of murder which commenced on the 14th instant continued throughout tho week-end and resulted in tho cold-blooded murder of another woman, the wife of District Inspector Blako of the Royal Irish Constabu-lary, who was murdered with hor husband at Gort. Co. Galway, while returning homo from a tonnis party,    Mrs, Blake rofused to leave hor dying husband and was murdered by tho assassins who stood beside and ovor her.    She had twelve woundsv*   She was an expectant mother, and was due to leave for England for her accouchement.       Two Military Officers of tho 17th lancers were murdered on tho same occasion.    In addition to the Members of tho Crown Forces killed In this series of attacks a number of civilian deaths by violence wore reported during the week-end^ including that of a priest, the Rev, J. 01Callaghan, who was shot in the house of Alderman do Rolste, M.P., in Cork City on the night of the 14th/15th  instant.    The circumstances of this tragedy have not yet been fully investigated.    Tho total number of deaths by violonoo during tho week-end was 35 of which 2 were women and 18 members of the Crown Forces.*No engagement of any importance between the Crown and Rebel Forces took place during the week. 1  attacks upon occupied Police Barracks were reported but none were of a sorious character.      An attack on the Military Barrack
at Courtmacsherry, iJandon District, Co. Cork, on the 14th instant, the details of which are not yet to hand, resulted in the death of one soldier.A daring and cleverly planned attempt to rescue McKeon, who is charged with the murders of two officers of the Police, from Mountjoy Prison, Dublin, was made on the 14th instant and nearly succeeded in effecting its purpose.    An armoured car which was standing outside the Abattoir on the North Circular Road about 10 a.rru was attacked by a party of thirty men, who, after overpowering the guard, two of whom were wounded, one mortally, seized the car and drove it rapidly to the Prison. On arrival there two of the rebels, who were dressed in full military officers1 uniform, proceeded to the room of the Governor and asked to see McKeon on official business, but fortunately the Governorfs suspicions were aroused and the demand was refused. Before the raiders could effect their object by force the alarm was given by a sentry and they were compelled to give up their enterprise.     The car was subsequently found abandoned near Clontarf Railway Station, a short distance outside the City, but its equipment, including two Hotchkiss machine guns, were missing and have not yet been recovered.Other outrages for the week included 52 raids on mails 14 raids for arms and 9 raids on the Offices of Petty Sessions Clerks.    Sums of money amounting to over  10,000 were seized in the last mentioned raids.Arrests for outrages and political offences numbered 44 for the week.Trials of Civilians by Courts Mart.1 al.Sixty-six trials by Court Martial were concluded during the week, convictions being obtained in fifty-three cases and
acquittals in thirteen.    The following is a summary of the sentences imposed;22 Sentences of Penal Servitude (3 years to 15 years)19       &quot;       &quot;   Imprisonment with (2 months to 2 years)hard labour2       &quot;        &quot;   Imprisonment (112 days to 6 months)without hard labour2       &quot;        &quot;   Detention in a Borstal Institution.6 Pines ( 2. to  100)2 Sentences      Remitted, talThe convictions included the case of a constable of the Royal Irish Constabulary who was sentenced to six months imprisonment with hard labour for looting, and the case3 of four constables each sentenced to two months imprisonment with hard labour for an assault on another constable.     Sentence of penal Servitude for fifteen years was imposed in nine cases of men convicted of carrying loaded firearms in the vicinity of a recent ambush in Co. Monaghan, and in three cases of men caught with fire-arms after an attempt at robbery in Belfast* Internment Orders.20 Orders for internment v;ere made during the week bringing the total number of persons now interned to 3,036. The number of orders at present awaiting completion is 152, and the number of appeals awating hearing 37. STATS OF THE POLICE FORCES.The recruiting figures for the Royal Irish Constabulary . are much below the average and for the first time for many months the week:s wastage due to retirements etc, in the Regular Force has not been made good..     I understand that the falling off in recruiting is largely due bo the present disturbed labour conditions in Great Britain and is not likely to be more than temporary.    The figures of the Auxiliary Division recruiting for the week are highly satisfactory and
show a net increase of  8 in the strength of the Division, The following are the usual particulars for the week; Regular fforoexStrength oh 8th May, 1921........................... 13,911Deaths during week , i..,............. 13Retirements......................... 10Resignations . ........................ 35Dismissals or discharge 3 ............ 19Total wastage.......... 78Recruits.)Ireland................ 5St. Britain............7277Net   decrease *................................,._    IStrength on 15th Bay, 1921..................... 13,910Auxiliary Division.Strength cn 8th May, 1921............................   1,479Recruits............... 34Resignations ..........._6^Net increase....................................iri m  88Strength on 15th May, 1921...........................   1,507The corresponding figures for the Dublin Metropolitan Polloe are as follows:Strength cn 7th May, 1921............................   1,125Resignations...........   5Recruits (Ireland) .....   4Net decreaseStrength on 14th May, 1981 ..,,,......................   1.124PRB3MT POLITICAL SITUATION I3j SOXHEHBHH IRELAND.Elections for the House of Commons of the Southern Irish Parliament have been rendered unnecessary by unopposed returns in every constituency.   Of the one hundred and twenty-eight members returned one hundred and twenty-four aro Sinn Feiners and four Unionists, the latter being the representatives
of the Jtoiblin University.   The newl^&apos; elected House is therefore mainly composed of members who have taken an active part in the republican movement.   Twenty-throe are at present in prison, fourteen of this number being convicted prisoners, and thirty are interned.   The remainder includes throe men who have osoaped from prison, four against whom Internment orders have been made, and thirty-six who are described in a police return as being *on the run1 on account of their suspected complicity in lawlessness of various kinds.   The results were, of course, fully expected, in view of the decision of the Constitutional Nationalist Party and of the Southern Unionists, not to oonteat the elections, but I am firmly of opinion that it would be a mistake to regard them as oonolus-ive evidence that the majority of the people of Southern Ireland are prepared to give their unswerving support to a policy of republicanism.   Notwithstanding the tragic events of the past few days, whioh can possibly be explained as a desper-ate attempt on the part of the extremists to stampede the whole nation along the road of violence, there are good grounds for believing that the general body df the public is strongly-opposed to further bloodshed and eager for a settlement by negotiation.   The effect of the week-end murders upon public opinion lends confirmation tffl this view.   The murders of Miss Barrington and Mrs Blake are described in the whole of the Dublin Press in terms of horror and amazement, while the murder of JPather C^Callaghan, which in other circumstances would have evoked a storm of resentment and reproach against the Crown forces has attracted comparatively little attention. In Ulster the election campaign has proceeded without any-untoward incident on either side, and the moderate and restrained speeches of Sir James Craig have done much to- o  -
encourage the belief, which as the rebljLt oi hie recent interview with Mr de Valera, is no v. rapidly gaining ground in Southern Ireland, that many of the difficulties which stand in the way of a peaceful settlement are capable of solution by direct negotiations between the two leaders of the Irish people.flntd.)
