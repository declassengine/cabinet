(j)    Memorandum on some statemenls contained in Pampfrlot issuod by the International Labour Office (Enclosure &quot;e&quot;).(2)     Before roforring in dotail to thoso I think it desirable first togivo you a resume of the general position in rogard to tho question of tho use of load in paint, with particular reforenco to the position taken by this Department in tho matter, and also a noto as to the circumstances which gave rise to the Home Office lotter of tho 1st March.(3)     In 1911 a Departmental Oommitteo was appointed by the Homo beoretary &quot;to investigate tho dangerattendant on the use of paints&quot; ........&quot; ooritaining load to the health of persons&quot; &quot;engaged in painting buildings, and to&quot; &quot;consider and report what should be dono&quot; &quot;to obviate or reduce the danger&quot;.Tho number of witnesses examined totalled 118,of whom 93 were invitod by the Committee to give evidence, the remaining 25 wore brought forward by tho White-load Oorrodors Section of the London Ohambor of Commerce.(3a)   Sir Henry Tannor and Mr. Pattorson, Clerk of Works (Kew) attended beforo tho Committoe as representatives of tho Department and the evidence given by thorn may bo summed up in tho following oxtracts taken from pagos 45, 44 and 95 of tho Committee^ Report (CD, 7882).
&quot;Sir Henry Tanner is satisfied that zinc wh:.te&quot;paint answers thoir purposes perfectly........&quot;and considers tho Office of Y/orks formula for &quot;loadlcss paints applicable to all kinds of &quot;outside paint ing&quot;*&quot;Sir Henry thought that tho oxporience of the &quot;Office of Works was sufficient to justify the &quot;abolition of tho use of white lead because &quot;some maniacturors of loadloss paints would come &quot;into the field as a result of such action.&quot;Loadless paints were adopted by the Office of nV/orks on the grounds both of health and the &quot;superiority of tho paint,&quot;&quot;Sir Henry Tanner, the Principal Architect of &quot;the Office of Works for England and V/ales and &quot;in charge of tho upkeep of diplomatic and &quot;consular buildings abroad, also attonded and &quot;corroborated tho evidence of Mr. Pattorson; &quot;Sir Henry said he had satisfiod himself that &quot;tho Office of Works formula for loadless paints &quot;would be applicable to all kinds of outside &quot;painting, and that load is not required, except &quot;for a first coat on iron and steel, rogarding &quot;which experiments aro still in progress, &quot;Sir Henry Tanner considered that if lead wero &quot;prohibited architects would spocify paints w:&apos;th &quot;a zinc basis, and he thought the experience &quot;of the Office of Works was sufficient to &quot;justify the abolition of the uso of white lead&quot;.
(4)     Tho Committoo wero informed that a general instruction was issued in June 1907 that 2inc white paints woro to be usod and that it was thought that this instruction had been generally observed by all under Sir Henry Tanner!s jurisdiction.     This reservation was made as it was admitted in evidence that white lead paint had been used on the Menai Bridge, but Sir Henry stated that that work was under the diroction of the Chief Engineer, and not under himself as Principal Architect.(5)     Tho importanoo placed upon tho evidence given on behalf of tho Department will bo gauged from the fact that in the &quot;Analysis of l/vidonco&quot; under sub-heading &quot;Users of leadless paints&quot; the Roport states:-&quot;The most important evidence under this head rolates &quot;to the uso for a number of years, of zinc paints &quot;by H.H. Office of Works (Page 95 of Report.)&quot;(6)    The recommendation eventually mado by the Committee - one member dissenting - was that a law should bo introduced in this country prohibiting the importation, sale or use of any paint materials which contains more than bfo of its dry weight of a soluble lead compound.The one member - Mr. Y/.G. Sutherland - not in agreement with the findings of tho majority of the Committee, submitted a Minority Roport in which he gave it as his opinion that &quot;before resorting to tho extreme courso of prohibiting tho use of so valuable a material as whito load .......... a trial should first be givento Regulations&quot; (i.o. prohibition of dry rubbing down sale of whito load only in paste form etc., etc.)
(7)    Lir. Sutherland in his Memorandum attacked very vigorously the ovidenoo given on &quot;behalf of the Department, particularly that given by Mr, Patterson, and submitted that &quot;ho conclusions that should have weight with Parliament can be deduced from the evidence tendered by i,r. Patterson on behalf of the Office of Works&quot;.The main grounds of Mr- Sutherland&apos;s complainwere:-(a) That the exporionce of the Office of Works rested exclusively on what are known as ready mixod Proprietary paints.(b) That our experience wa3 limited - this being based on an answer given by .!.ir. Patterson in which he stated that wo &quot;only occasionally&quot; used flatting paints.(c) That no proper records wore kept either of tho condition of the paint on some of the buildings meritionod to the Committee, orof statistics of illness amongst the workmen.It should bo mentioned that the othor members of the Committee in their &quot;i^otes on Mr. Sutherland&apos;s Memorandum&quot; dissociated themselves from the way in which the evidence relating to the Office of Works had been dealt with by him.(8)     The Committee&apos;s roport was presented in November, 1914, but no further, action appears to have been taken in tho matter - presumably owing to the War intervening - until June 1920 when the Home Office issued a memorandum (see enclosure d) to Government Departments, Local Authorities, Hallway Companies, etc., etc., and also to the Trade Press referring to
the Report of tho Committee proviouoly mentioned and also the Report of a similar Committee which examined the problem in regard to the Coach Building Trade. This memorandum stated that &quot;the enquiries had established that quite as satisfactory     results can bo obtained with non-poisonous paints as with white lead paint&quot;, that &quot;only paints of the character rocommendod by the Committees are now being used by H.M.Office of Works for Government Buildings&quot; and expressed the hope that &quot;employers who are still using lead paints will now arrange to discontinue their use, and substitute paints whioh comply with the Committoe&apos; s recommendations j/So far as I have been able to ascortainContractors do not use zinc base paints but still preferlead base paints on account of their greater durability.Por instance, Liessrs, iiowlom &amp; Co.,.. who for years have been the Department^ Llalntonance Contractors, and assuch use zinc base paints on our work, still use Whitew.orklead base paint for all other/they undertake unloss a special demand is made by their clients for tho use of zinc base paints.It should also be mentioned that by the tormo of the lease of Gaxton House whioh was taken over from the Lessors Messrs. Holloway Bros., Contractors, this Department was required to repaint tho properties with 5 coats load paint once every four years.     It was represented to Messrs. Holloway that this Department was not permitted to use lead paint but they would not agree to the substitution of zinc paints and it was, thoreforo, necessary in this case to repaint with lead paint.
(9)     The circumstances: loading to the recent re-opening of the matter are understood to bo as followsThe question of protection against lead-poisoning formed one of tho subjects for consideration at the First  Session of the International Labour Conference of the International Labour Organisation (which is associated with the League of nations) held at Washington in 1919 and it was decided that the question of the prohibition of the use of white lead in painting should be placed on the Agenda of the Third Session of the Conference to be held in Genova in October next.(10.),   In preparation for dealing with the matter at the Conference a pamphlot on tho subject (enclosure ME&quot; which includes a Questionnaire, has boon issued by the International Labour Office, Geneva.     Theso have beon forwarded to the various Governments of States whiol are members of the League of Lations and of tho International Labour Organisation, with a view to ascertaining from them information from whioh tho International Labour Office can submit considered reports and proposals or draft recommendations to the conference-(11)   It is undorstood from a reply given in the House of Lords on the 27th March to a question asked by Lord Askwith regarding those Questionnaires that the Government, when replying to the Questionnaire, will call the attention of tho Intoi-natiorial Labour Office to any points resulting from investigations or experiments by which the memorandum can be supplemented or corrected or any inaccuracies or omissions remedied.
(12)     The information which the norae Office is now soeking is required primarily for the purpose of formulating the Government&apos; a reply to this Questionnaire and it is believed that the Home Office is relying to a considerable extent upon this Department for information in regard to tho results which have been obtained with non-poisonous paints,(13)     I attaon a copy of the pamphlet and Questionnaire issued by the Labour office   (Red cover enclosure wfci&quot;) and also a oopy of a pamphlet stating the case against prohibition v/hioh has been issued by the London Chamber of Commerce on bohalf of the White Load Corroderfb Trade iJeotlon (green cover enclosure &quot;pf).(14)   Before referring in detail to those pamphlets it should be stated that it is agreed by the British White Lead Corrodero and Makers that some measures to moot the dangers arising from tho manufaoturo and use of Whito lead in painting aro desirable and the roal issue appears to bo whether tho matter shall be dealt with by prohibiting the use of white lead in painting, or by statutory Regulations designed to avoid all sources of danger from tho use of whito load in paint.(15)     The pamphlet and Questionnaire issued by the International Labour Office urges strongly the case for entire prohibition and does so in such a manner as to draw strong complaints from the London Chamber of Commerce (and these have been voiced in the Houso of Lords by Lord Askwith) that many of the statements made are inaccurate and biassed and that tho whole question has beon prejudged.     An instance of a very misleading statement is to be found on page PJ5 (International Labour Conference Pamphlet) where it is stated, under
sub-heading &quot;Practical Experience&quot; that &quot;enquiries undertaken in Franco, Belgium, Italy, England, etci,1^&quot; resulted in the prohibition of white load in tho painting of interiors&quot;.     This statomont is incorrect as no such prohibition as is implied exists in this country at tho present - or in either of the countries mentioned so far as can be ascertained.      It is also clear that tho pamphlet contains statements regarding results obtainable with non-poisonous paints that are not confirmed by the oxporienoe of the Department, and the assumption contained in the first quostion of the Questionnaire on page 31 which roads &quot;In view of the fact that it is now technically possible to replace white lead in painting by efficient substitutes&quot; certainly does appear to afford grounds for complaint that the whole mattor has boon pro judged.     Othor statements contained in this pamphlet to which attention should be drav/n are reforrod to in enclosure &quot; j&quot; attached.A brief reference to this Department is made on page 3) on this pamphlet.(16)     The pamphlet issued by the London Chamber of Commerce endeavours to show that the danger can effectually be dealt with by Regulations governing the use of whito lead.      The interest of the White Load Oorrodors in the mattor is frankly stated and thoy presont a well reasoned case in support of their view.Attention should however, bo drawn, to the very strong criticisms of the Department made on pages XXVI and XXVII of this pamphlet whore it is submitted that &quot;tho slip-shod experiments which have   been carried out by H .1,1. Off ice of Works oannot bo seriously considered as a basis for legislation&quot; and that our experiments have been carried out &quot;with no pretonco to
the scientific accuracy which is necessary for such investigations&quot;.In this connection it may he remarked that the Office of Works&apos; experiments on paints are merely practical experiments recording relative durability of manufactured paints.     They are of oourso. empirical and consist diefly in applying to woodwork ready mixed paints suppliod by various Manufacturers and exposing them over a period of tino to atmospheric conditions and inspecting the results at intervals.     The Government Chemist analyses these ready mixed paints on behalf of the department and their chemical constituents therefore are known.&apos;This method of ascertaining practical results is satisfactory for the purpose of tho Department when determining tho rolative valuos and durability of the paints suppliod by Manufacturers, but it may be considered necessary in the future to deal with the testing of paints in a thoroughly scientific manner. For example, our tosts can take no aooount of the method of manufacturing the various ingredients such as the base (zinc, lead, antimony, etc.,) tho oils, varnish1 turpentines, etc.     The quality of thoso ingredients must it is thought be connected with the method of manufacture and although linsoed oil for instance, may be specified eb an ingredient of a paint, yet linseed oil supplied by one Manufacturer may differ very materially from that supplied&apos; by another, and tho durability of paints mixed with tho different linseed oils would probably vary - the oxidation of the linseed oil b-oing an important feature in the drying of the paints *
Another factor to be considered in future 14*) experiments is the method of mixing the ingredients0 This also, it is thought would have an important bearing upon the ultimate durability of tho paints used.Attention should be drawn to the method adopted by the Admiralty whon tosting various paints. It is stated that tho practice of the Admiralty is to purchase all the paint ingredients separately to sample or to  spooification and to compound them at the Depots or on the ships for subsequent use as paint,     &amp;y this method of the materials can be tested technically and analytically and a far greater degree of control of the various ingredients is therefore, exercised than is possible with the Offioe of V/orks which has to use proprietary paints and must confine itself to a olear spocification of ingredients.To test and analyso tho ingredients of various paints in this manner would of oourse, necessitate tho appointment of a special Staff and it has hitherto been thought that it is unnecessary for the Department to enter into the question in such detail as the tests upon paints which have been carried out for    long number of years wore primarily to Inform the Department whether such-and-such a paint was suitable for a specific purposeIf, however, it is proposed to introduce legislation with regard to tho use of White lead paints and the Information supplied ,by the Department is to be used as a reason for such legislation, it becomes necessary to review the methods whereby the information was obbained which formed the basis of Sir Henry Tanner1 s evidence, before the Departmental Committee.     It cannot be denied that the Offioe of V/orks experiments are not sufficiently scientific and detailed to warrant legislation prohibiting the use of white lead paints *
(17)     another pamphlet on very similar linos has been issued by kessro. V/hite and Leonard, Solicitors, on behalf of the British White Lead Makers.     Tho same criticism of the Department is ropoated in this pamphlet,(18)     The proooding is I think a brief and fairly acourate review of the position to date.As regards our own position in the matter at this date, the use of non-poisonous paints has been continued and on reviewing the position in the light of the experience gained during tho poriod whioh has elapsed since the date of the Committee&apos;s enquiry as disclosed by tho replies received to our departmental Questionnaire (enclooure &quot;b&quot;) the main conclusions reached are that whilst such paints can fairly bo oonoiderod efficient substitutes for white lead paints for interior painting, this claim cannot be maintained as regards thoir use for exterior painting.The Loard^ Chief Maintenance Surveyor and Mr. Koasman, who are in continual touch with tho question have formed tho most decided opinion, that zinc base paints aro quite unsatisfactory for external use and cause tho Department to incur considerable additional charges owing to tho sorious lack of durability of zinc base paints.   Mr. Rylo has given mo evidonco also to the effect that internal work paintod with zinc base paints will not allow of the cleaning which can be undertaken with load base paints.The kooretary has had occasion to call my attention to the unsatisfactory character of external work executed in zinc baso paints and from my personal&apos; experience, I cannot support tho evidence given by iJir Honry Tanner before the Departmental Committee *
(19)     The replies received to our departmental questionnaire were almost unanimous instating that lack of durability under exposure to atmospheric and climatic conditions is the chief defect of sine oxide paint.   This is in agreement with the findings of several of the Foreign Commissions In which the undoubted superiority of white lead paint for exterior paint is declared..it should, of course be understood that the answers to the questionnaire merely refer to opinions of the officers of the Department who are responsible for the maintenance and up-keep of the buildings in our charge.   These opinions are based upon general observations and not upon exact comparative records of the durability of paint kept for a series of years. The opinions may, however, be regarded as of value since the officers of the Department were not prejudiced against the use of zinc paints when Instructions were first issued that white lead&quot;was. to be eliminated.    The admitted failure of the zinc paints to withstand external atmospheric conditions is the basis of the opinions, and is confirmed by every technical supervising officer of the Department.(20)     The main causes of this weakness in zinc oxide paint are thought to be:-(a)   That the chemical inter-action which is definitely known to take place between white lead and the oil medium, and which gives to the resulting film the valuable qualities of hardness, toughness and elasticity peculiar to the white lead paint film, is by no means so complete in the case of zinc oxide paint-
It is in fact the opinion of some authorities that there is no inter-action between zinc oxide and the oil t(b)   That the action of the sulphuric and sulphurous acids present in town air and. in soot, although perhaps less apparent, is more destructive to zinc oxide paint than to white lead paint.    In the case of the former these destructive influences result in the formation of soluble compounds which are dissolved out of the film by rain thereby weakening it and ultimately causing its decay; whereas their effect on the lead paint is to form insoluble compounds which, thoug.i causing discolouration and darkening are not removed from the film by the action of rain and their formation does not result in disintegration of the paint.(21)     This appears- to be confirmed by the results of the tests of white paints carried out at the G.P.O.;West, where zinc oxide base white paints have been exposed since 1916 alongside white lead base paints..*Inspection shews that although the zinc paints have!retained their colour, the surface can easily be rubbed up and continued rubbing will expose the grain of the wood.   On the other hand although the white lead paints have darkened considerably, if the surface be cleaned it is found that the paint film beneath is intact and still remains an effective protective covering to the wood, rendering re-painting unnecessarySmall samples scraped from some of these:, -; -tests boards have recently been examined by the Government Chemist and a comparison of the analyses
of the paints at this date with the analyses of the several coats as originally applied shews clear evidence of the formation, of carbonates, sulphides and sulphates by atmospheric action.   The following are the conclusions drawn by the Government Chemist on the results of this examination:- a copy of the Report dealing with this is attached (enclosure &quot;3&quot;).1.     That zinc oxide ground in oil is more readily attacked and washed away by exposure to the atmosphere than the lead compounds.2.     That the deleterious effects of exposure to the atmosphere Is less distinctly marked in the case of varnish paints than where oil alone has been used. In the case of paints ground, in oil much of the oil has disappeared;   but when varnish has been used in addition the loss of medium is appreciably less,(22)     I therefore consider it can fairly be stated that the experience of recent years, both In practical and experimental work, has established that zinc oxide paint is not equal to white lead paint for exterior work.    It therefore becomes necessary to modify considerably the statements which were made on behalf of the Department before the Home Office Committee and this had been dealt with in the Draft Memorandum to the Home Office, attached.(23)     With regard to the present issue it may be questioned whether the Department is called upon to express any opinion as to which method of dealing with the danger, i*e. prohibition or regulations, should be adopted.   The matter, however, is now of primary importance to the Department owing to the
severe reduction in the standard of maintenance insisted upon by the Treasury due to the need of most drastic economy-   Presumably the Home Office Is the Department to advise the Government on this, after consideration of the Recommendations made by the Committee and of any fresh information arising out of experience during the period which has elapsed since the Committeefs investigations that may now be offered.(24)     It is, however, interesting to note that of the countries which have already taken action in the matter Prance only decided upon prohibition and although this should have come into operation in 1915, according to a statement made in the pamphlet Issued, by the London Chamber of Commerce it has never been put into force.   Austria prohibited the use of white lead for interior work but Its use under regulations is allowed for exterior painting.   Germany, Belgium, Switzerland and the State of Geneva have all dealt with the matter by regulations.The conclusion reached by the Home Office Committee (on painting of buildings) in regard to regulations was that it was impossible to deal with the evil in question by regulations the reasons given beings1. Inadequacy of regulations.2. Difficulty of prohibiting dry rubbing down,38 The cost and difficulty of complying with various precautionary measures. 4c The insuperable difficulty of enforcingregulations by adequate inspection.t(25)     An opportunity has been taken of discussing the question with Dr. Fox of the Government Laboratory who holds views as to the undesirability of legislation&apos; on the lines of- the Recommendations of the Home Office Committees as they stand now as he considers these to bolb.
based on insufficient information.   He stated that the-   .... ;.    ,&apos;. &apos; !:,: ;v. ;,v: :;;rGovernment Chemist has intimated to Dr. Legge of theHome Office the outcome of further work on thosolubility of sulphate of lead modifying the deductionsmade oh page 102 of the Report of the Departmental &apos;*Committee in regard to the solubility question.It should here be mentioned that the Government Chemist has not yet been consulted by the Home Office in regard to the present Issue.( 6)     Dr. Pox is of opinion that the chief danger lies in the inhaling of dust produced by dry rubbing down in the fumes resulting from&apos;the burning off of old paint.(27)     With regard to the first he is of opinion that there is an element of danger in the effect of the dust Irrespective of whether or not it contains   lead.On this assumption the dry rubbing down ofany paint is attendant with a degree of danger to the-operatives, although the danger would obviously be increased in the case of dust of a poisonous nature as from lead paint..........    ;. ,.... .... ..i .... .... , :   ,, ....   .... ^ ,,   ....       .....(28) As regards burning off Dr. Fox considers the fumes given off during this process may be a source of. - - - .....        .... .. . -danger to the operatives but as these fumes mainly arise from the oil content  of the    paint this danger also would appear to be common to all paints, although againit would no doubt be greater in the case of white lead-paint.(29)     With regard to the above it should be mentioned that in the order of importance given to the channels of infection of lead-poisoning in the pamphlet issued by the International Labour Office (page 9) the digestive
canal is placed first and the respiratory canals are stated to have only a secondary importance.   This is directly contrary to the conclusion reached by the Departmental Committee on this point which was that &quot;entry by the respiratory system ... is by far the most dangerous to the worker .* * the risk entailed by entry by the alimentary system as a consequence of swallowing lead dust ... is small but not negligible&quot; (page 82 of report)*most(50)     In Dr, Fox*s view/of the danger would   be dealt with by the elimination of dust (by the prohibition of dry rubbing down) and by the elimination of burning off, by substituting paint solvents and by instilling the necessity for personal cleanliness upon the operatives *   With these views I am In complete agreement from practical experience alone.   He is definitely of opinion that zinc oxide paints are not equal to white lead paints for exterior use owing to the lack of chemical combination between zinc base and the oil medium as mentioned at (a) of paragraph (20).   He considers that a   paint containing white lead in combination with zinc oxide up to say 30$ of lead compounds for certain tints might be used without serious danger to the operatives provided the above conditions were respected,(31)     As regards the future attitude of the Department in relation to this question, the prohibition of white lead would not of course involve any change in our present practice, but in view of the data before me I must consider whether I should not ask the Board to remove the prohibition on the use of lead paints provided that medical opinion agrees that serious danger of lead poisoning can be overcome by adequate regulation,18 c
Should therefore it be decided to deal with the matter by regulations it would be for the Board to consider whether having regard to tho fact that owing to their greater durability, points containing white lead are more economical for exterior work, a reversion to the use of paints containing white lead up to limitations which might be suggested by the Government Chemist, used with careful adherence to regulations, would not in the interests of economy be justified..(32)     It is, therefore, suggested that before deciding on the final form of reply to the Home Office3 it being assumed that in this it would be desirable to indicate to the Home Office the probable attitude of this Department in the event of regulations being decided upon, it might be well to obtain the view of the Government Chemist on the chemical aspect of the whole question,(33)    Although this Department is not concerned with legislation that may be enforced concerning the use of paint bases, yet It should not be forgotten that the total prohibition of white paints would possibly injure a National Industry.   The necessary lead is obtained from the lead mines In England, whereas zinc Is imported from Belgium and America.From this point of view it would certainly appear to be desirable that there should be regulation of the use of white lead, rather than- its total prohibition.A reference has already been made to the pamphlets issued by the London Chamber of Commerce and by Messrs. White and Leonard on behalf of the British White Lead Makers.   The argument in both these phamp.le.ts (which are practically identical) is that as the
manufacture of white lead is a National industry the evils arising from its use should be dealt with by regulation rather than by prohibition.(34)     If, however, total prohibition were enforced it is desirable to see what its effect would be so far as this Department is concerned.   It is admitted that zinc base paints are less durable than white lead paints, and therefore work covered with zinc paints needs more frequent painting than work covered with white lead paints.   It follows, therefore that there will be a greater cost to the Department in the general painting maintenance, and the annual votes undoubtedly will have to be increased.The size of the problem as far as the Department is concerned can be gauged by the fact that we employ on an average 1,300 painters throughout the year and our expenditure on painting alone approximates to  360,000 per annum.It is. doubtful, what this increase may amount to, and it will vary with the difference of aspect, of material to be painted, and the difference of atmospheric condition.   It Is, however, not too much to say that the use of zinc paints may increase the maintenance costs of the Department from 15% to 20% over the whole programme of Maintenance and New Works.On the other hand the greater frequency of painting will give more employment to painters and labourers in a period of acute unemployment.(35)   There is a further question to be considered as to whether total prohibition would influence experimental work with a view to finding other bases which would be regarded as equal to white lead but not so poisonous,   it should be noted that already two new
bases have been mentioned, namely titanium oxide and antimony oxide *   They are, however, comparatively new and untried materials and it would be necessary to carry out experiments for a considerable period of time and to acquire some years of experience before It can definite]; be stated that they are satisfactory. *So far as experiments point out at the present time It appears that these two bases will not be so durable as white lead, the reason being that they do not appear to combine chemically with the linseed oil, the white lead and oil forming an impervious skin which is unaffected seriously by atmospheric condition.It will be observed, therefore, that although the zinc base paints have been in use oy this Department since 1907 (namely 14 years age) yet hitherto investigations an experiments that have been carried out have not yet been able to evolve a base for a paint whlc may be regarded as good and as durable as the lead base, hi fact, the number of substitutes that have been trice: have been very few*(36)     The question of prohibiting wholly the use of white lead paint   has arisen through the necessity of protecting Operatives from lead poisoning.   It is of course, very desirable to have every safeguard against danger to the operatives but when the information on th.i point is carefully analysed it Is not possible to ignore the very serious differences of opinion that exist amorg medical men upon this most important matter.On reading the Home Office Departmental Committee^ report It can be seen that there is considerable doubt upon the following points:-
(a) The actual number of cases of lead poisoningper annum.(b) Whether medical practitioners are always correctin ascribing to lead poisoning illnesses which produce similar symptoms.(c) The method of contracting lead poisoning whetherfrom:-(1) Dust from mixing the dry white lead with oilo(2) Dust arising from paint which has dried on overalls.(3) Dust from rubbing down old p*lnt*(4) Contamination of food by unwashed hands.(5) fumes from burning off paint.(6) Through the respiratory system or the digestive canal.(7) From other ingredients in the mixed paint such as turpentine or turpentine substitutes.From this point Of view it seems very desirable that some further and more accurate information concerning the sources of the illnesses or ibed to white lead poisoning should be ascertained before embarking upon legislation prohibiting the use of white lead.(37)     This point was.dealt with in a very interesting paper read by Sir Kenneth Goadby before the Society of Arts on the 30th May,   In this paper Sir Kenneth stated that it was his definite opinion, a very large number of cases ascribed to lead poisoning are due primarily to the present of turpentine and turpentine, substitutes in paints and he came to this conclusion after making an examination of various operatives who had been employed in painting work on HoM*0.Wv Buildings.   As this was a very important matter I obtained from Sir Kenneth a statement In writing which is as follows:-
15i&quot;It has been freely stated, and the majority of authorities have agreed, that the incidence of high blood pressure is common in the painting trade, and this high blood pressure .1s stated to be mainly associated with Arterio-sclerosis - that arterio - sclerosis leads to many of the diseases from which painters suffer, and that arterio-sclerosis In the painter, is caused and determined by the lead dust and fumes, which they absorb.This is a point of very considerable importance, and in view of my experience in white lead factories, I obtained permission (through the courtesy of Sir Lionel Earle) to examine the blood pressures of a number of men, employed upon painting by the Office of Works, and who hid not used lead paint for many years.So far, I have only been able to examine 45 men, but I have compared them with two groups of 40 and 50 men employed in the manufacture of white lead, taking only those who were exposed to white lead dust.The result of this investigation shws, that the painters do show a very high systolic blood pressure, forty per cent of the men examined shew :a pressure above that normal for their age (a     100 in num.

I am of opinion that the Arteriosclerosis from which Painters undoubtedly suffer, and to which may be referred a good deal of the Illness from which they suffer cannot be attributable to lead,Prom the result of my experience in many directions, I am of opinion that turpentine, and esipeclali turpentine substitutes (Benzine Compounds) are the deleterious substances, and that the anaemia (shewn by Pallor of Conjunctivas) fine,tremor, etca - (which was present In many of the painters examined) is attributable to the Volatile compounds used as a paint vehicle.   1&apos;hat the volatile compounds in paint thinning, may produce symptoms indistinguishable from lead poisoning, to any but an experienced observer, has been brought to my attention recently, by one of the painters whom I examined and who recently suffered from an acute attack of poisoning (abdominal paint with colic) which was traceable to the use of highly thinned paint.I am of opinion that the whole matter requires most careful investigation&apos;^(Sd.)

These replies are analysed on the attached statement and a brief summary of the whole is given under.It should first be mentioned that all the paints which have been approved for use are ready mixed paints,, with zinc oxide base, and the questionnaire was designed to secure a clear and concise record of the results obtained by such paints in practical use, as compared with the results given by white lead paints.SUMMARY OF REPLIES.tmber of (1)      The average number of Painters employed perinters.        week on Maintenance and New, Works, etc, (taken over 12 months) approximates 1,300,kses of lead      (2)      One death from lead poisoning is reported from fisoning,      Pembrey, but it is pointed out that this lead poisoning was not contracted on our work.

This is thought to he due to some action between the zinc oxide and the chrome used for colouring and it is a question on which the Government Chemist might perhaps be consulted. .CONCLUSIONS.The main conclusions to be drawn from the replies received may briefly be stated to be as follows:-No cases of lead poisoning contracted on the work of the Department have arisen within the experience of the Officers circularised.Zinc paint Whilst the non-poisonous paints used by theV. lead paint.Department may fairly be claimed to be efficient substitutes for white lead paint for internal vork the experience of recent years does not allow of this claim being maintained as regards external work, the weight of opinion in regard to this being that for work exposed to climatic conditions the non-poisonous paints used by the Department are not equal to white lead paint-as they do not possess either the durability or protective qualities of white lead paints.(Xntld.)

The use of non-poisonous paints has been&apos;continued up to the present and as it has recently been found possible to dispense with lead for the priming coat of Iron and steel, non-poisonous paints have now been adopted for the painting work on the Buildings of the Department.Royal Palaces, Public Buildings generally, Post Offices, Telephone Exchanges, Government Research and Test Buildings, Housing, Factories, etc,etc.It will be understood that this figure fluctuates considerably but a fair average taken over twelve months would be 1300,General Review of the Position since date of Committee&apos;s Enquiry *Elimination of lead for priming Iron and Steel.As mentioned above, at the date of the Committee^ enquiry red and orange lead was still being usod for the priming coat of iron and steel but subsequent extended tests which were completed in 1919 established that fairly satisfactory results could be obtained with non-poisonous paints, and the use of red and orange lead for priming iron and steel has
now therefore beon discontinued by this . Department.     The results of these tests were communicated to the Home Office in May. 1.919 and a memorandum. ( Ho. 20r7v818/9) on the Tests was issued by the Home Offioe in June 1920 to Departments and Public Authorities interested, and also to the Trade Press.      A copy of the Departmental Report on the Test and also of the Home Office memorandum. No. RO-^B 18/91 is attached.The exclusive use of non-poisonous paints has been continued up to the present and on reviewing the position in the light of the experience gained since the date of the Committee&apos;s enquiry the following conclusions are arrived at t-(a) that for internal work, satisfactory results equal to those obtain^bl-) with lead can be obtained with non-poisonous paints, which are suitable for internal work in that they are comparatively free from, smell.     The durability of non-poisonous paints under cleaning however is found to be much less than that of lead paints used internally.(b) that for external work, the non-poisonous paints used by the Department (practically all of which are Zinc Oxide Paints) do not appear to be equal to Vftiite lead paints; while under cleaning, the durability of zinc paints is very much less than that of lead paints.(c) that as regards cost, for internal work non-poisonous paint is if anything a little cheaper in the first instance than lead paint, but for external work the great
advantage Is with lead paint owing to its&apos;;  I-,/ I IBmuch greater covering quality and vastly greater durability.nerally.- In arriving at the above conclusionsconsideration has been given to the results obtained in comparative exposure tests which, have been undertaken during the period and also to information obtained from exhaustive enquiries which have been made among the practical men concerned in the supervision of the Departments painting works.Prom these it is clear that for external work the non-poisonous paints which have been used by the Department do not give results in any way equal to those obtainable with lead paint, this experience of such paint iti practical use being confirmed by extended comparative exposure tests recently completed at the G.P.O. West. Here Zinc Oxide paints, varying in composition as regards proportion of base and medium, were exposed alongside lead base paints with results that indicate that the non-poisonous paints exposed do not possess the durability of lead paints.other Research. It is clear however that there is stillconsiderable scope for research in the matter and further investigations now in hand - in which the Government Chemist is actively collaborating - include the examination of the newer non-poisonous paint bases such as Antimony Oxide and Titanium Oxide.     Although the first w Bases. named has a good reputation in U.S.A.both are comparatively new to this country. Manufacturers in this country are now giving considerable attention to them, and the
appearance -of earapde^ni?lii.oli*xht,.*&apos;&apos;? &quot;been -submi tted to short exposure tests warrants further investigation.A new series of comparative tests has been arranged and manufacturers have been invited to submit samples of paints for exposure, the only limitation imposed upon them being that the paintB submitted shall not contain soluble lead in excess of the amount mentioned in the Committee^ recommendation, i.e. 5^ calculated on the dry weight.     Steps are being taken to ensure that a number of paints containing the newer bases used both alone and in combination with other bases, are included in these tests, and although it will be some little time before it will be possible.to arrive at any definite conclusions, it is hoped that some results of value may be obtained,In the meantime,  the use of non-poisonous paints only, for the painting work of this Department is of course continuing. Whether the elimination of the defects of non-poisonous paints as at present manufactured is within the bounds of possibility, is not known and no useful expression of opinion can be offered on this point.     Leading manufacturers of pigments and paints may be induced to give greater attention to non-poisonous substitutes than has been given in the past, in whioh case it might be anticipated that further experimentation and research will evolve a non-poisonous paint which possesses the durability of lead paint and its superior covering quality for external work.4w. &quot;2nd June, 19SI.
CONFIDENTIAL REPORT ON THE TESTS OF PAINT,PRIMINGS ON...... -&apos;i-L.  i        -ili i    jn ii i       -mi.-!,    t   i   -      i. i. . i    imi      --in--1--    -    i-i    u.r iirn-iIROfl AT KE?.IN the autumn of the year 1911, Sir Henry Tanner was asked by members of the Home Offioe Committee on paints, whether it was possible to dispense with red and orange lead as paint &quot;primers&quot; on iron.     He replied that this would depend on whether an efficient substitute could he found, and a definite answer could only be given after exposure tests had been made.WITH a view to arriving at a decision he gave instructions that these tests should be carried out at the Royal Gardens, Kew.IT was decided to test every iron primer brought to our notice of whatever make or composition. Many firms sent us samples of their specialities, and some, such as Messrs. R. Gay &amp; Co., not only sent in a series of samples of their own make, but prepared others also to our Specification.ABOUT one hundred samples have been tested.THE pigments of the samples included Lead  -Carbonate, Lead Oxides, Lead Chromates, Zinc Oxide, Lithopone, Zinc Chromate, Barium Chromate, various Iron Oxides, Graphites, Bitumens, with the usual extenders, Barium Sulphate, Silica and Magnesium Silicate&apos;, in various proportions.     The pigments vary much in their physical characteristics, some being much coarser than others.     This affects the results even where the pigments are the same.1 *
IT was recognised, however, that pign.er.itfl are not the only important factors in paint composition. The medium is very important in a protecting paint film and it is probable that the differing mediums account for paints with the same pigment giving such widely different results as will be observed in the table, Irrespective of the physical character of the pigmentB.LINSEED oil is the most common medium for paint but it is, at its best, porous and imperfect.     An improvement is often made by the addition of a proportion of good Varnish or Chinese Tung Oil, or Tung Oil Varnish,HENCE some of the samples tried have the same pigments with varying mediums.     Other samples have special medium, - the secrets of the Firms supplying on which it is claimed the. paint largely depends, These are indicated by a-  *:f   on the Schedule of Results.IT was further recognised that a good iron primer which is normally intended to protect an iron surface, and is also itself usually protected from the weather by subsequent coats, might not give the same results when used both as a primer and a finishing coat. It was therefore decided to give the iron test plates one coat only of the paint.     It is obvious also that&apos; the good or ill result   of a surface painted with two or three coats of differing paints would depend so much on the last coat as to confuse the results, and hide the true value of the primer.     Moreover, as iron primings in large buildings are often exposed for as much as two years before they are covered with the finishing coats, it was thought best to give the space allotted to each sample on the iron test plates one
coat only, except where a second ooat was specially sent for application.     In the latter oases a second space was given two coats,&apos; that fact belrg stated in the table.THE! tests were started in February 1912.THE samples were put on to iron plates whioh had been thoroughly cleaned and dried in a painter&apos;s shop, each sample covering an area of about 12&quot; x 4&quot; After twenty-four hours they were numbered, and the day following one plate was exposed to the weather on a wall facing south, and a second plate was exposed in the warm damp atmosphere of a tropical green-houseIT was decided that these test plates should be examined every twelve months by Messrs.Pott, Allison and Patterson and that marks should be awarded, the highest obtainable being ten.FOUR examinations have been made and the results were agreed on by the&apos; Assessors and duly, recorded. These are attached.THE atmospheric conditions in this case were very severe, being-warm and damp.     There was always condensation on the plates, and they were often sprayed with water when the plants were receiving such attention.     These conditions are akin to those in water tanks and gasometers *THE beat results under these conditions were given by the red leads, which gain the first and fourth   places,,     These are composed of pure red. lead and Boiled Linseed Oil.     They were mixed at Kew and applied to the iron plates within half-an-hour of mixing.
THESE are other red and orange lead samples cn these plates which have given poor results.   These I latter are all of the ready mixed type with the usualextenders, applied to the plates a few days at least after mixing.   This emphasises the fact that where red lead is used for much conditions it is only superior to other paints if mixed and applied immediately.   &amp;ed lead should on no account be used in Drinking Water Tanks.THE following ready mixed paints have given good results under these severe conditions.MESSRS. Randall&apos;s O.W.. white and green finish are 2nd and 7th on the list&quot;, these have a special medium.THE 3rd place is gained by Messrs. Parsons&apos; Lead Chromate with special medium.THE 5th on the list is Messrs.

GRAPH I TiilS.   These graphite paints would make good primers for iron roofs, park railings, etc, &quot;but from other tests made,   it is found to be of the greatest importance to follow Graphite primings with subsequent coats of similar paint, whioh can be obtained in black, iron grey,., dark brown or dark-green,GRAPHITE primings give little grip for hard or varnish paints which, when used over them, are found to scale off. Another defect of graphite is that when used as a finishing coat with a soft medium it soon rubs off where, handled, and so needs renewal. It has, however, a large field of usefulness for the purposes above indicated, - especially if the finishing coat is bound by a little varnish.IT was thought that Graphite paint would be improved by a small percentage of lead oxide, but this is not borne out by these tests.IRON OXIDES.-   Messrs. Howse&apos;3 black Iron Oxides are placed in the 1st and 4th groups.THE following also take a high place as iron primerscGranitic Paint Co&apos;s Oxide of Iron and ZincMessrs.

others take a place in the 4th and 5th groups and also other positions well up in the list.1&apos;HEI stood the test well in the Greenhouse in addition to that of ordinary weather conditions, with ordinary mediums, and can he safely used as primers for iron under all conditions where red lead has hitherto been used.THEI are safe primers for any subsequent coats of paint, and have the additional advantage that they can be designed to give the best results with not more than the bc/o of soluble lead stipulated by the ^ome Offioe committee   They oan be bought ready mixed without fear of deterioration or of setting hard at the bottom of the drum.LEAD OXIDES *     The lead oxides appear to take the fourth place as a class.   The highest result of the class is 8.25 average for a red lead paint mixed at Lew, and applied immediately.   The highest marks for a ready mixed lead oxide is gained by Messrs. Berger-!s Orange Lead (g) 6,87..THIS result by no means bears out the reputation in which lead oxides are held,   The tests show that for all ordinary purposes better iron primers are available.TES tests thus give a definite answer to the Home Office Committee&apos;s question.   The Board will oubtless acquaint the Committee&apos;s Secretary of the fact.ITTMEH &amp; THESE are generally used for marine, agriculturalJR PA1HTS.or temporary work.   They should only be used as a primer on iron where it is intended to finish in the same material - they are made in dark greens andbrowns as well as black.6c
OIL paints should not &quot;be used over Tar paints.THIS results of the tests of Bitumen paints indicate that as rust preventers they are not very satisfactory.TfljfcS Fulham Co&apos;s Duraline heads the list with an average of 7.0 in weather.   Uessrs. Howse&apos;s Black and ^reen are second with 5.87, while others follow with marks from 5.5 down to 2.0.IT may be useful to add that since those tests were commenced the results of the American Tests by an expert Committee have been published.IA these tests all the paint samples were mixed with the same quality medium, and they have thus arrived at the relative value of pigments as iron primers under weather conditions as apart from mediums.II their published results, the Ohromates are easily first.   Sublimed White Lead, Prussian Blue, Iron Oxide and Natural Graphite follow in the order named.   Red Lead is seventeenth on the list.A Copy of the list of paints which gained an average of 8 or more marks out of a possible 10 in the American Tests, is attached.&apos;0 OkMiaUD AT ION.

FORM 1708.203,818/91.HiThe Secretary of State desires to draw attention to the Reports (Cd. 7882 and Cmd, 630), of the Departmental Committees which investigated the danger to workers in the building and coach painting trades from the use of lead paints. As a result of these inquiries, it has been established that quite as satisfactory results can be obtained with non-poisonous paints as with white lead paint (except for heraldic painting and fine lining),, and both Committees recommend that (subject to these exceptions), the use of any paint containing more than 5 per cent, of its dry weight of a soluble lead compound (to be determined in the manner specified in the Reports), should be prohibited.In view of the numerous cases of lead poisoning which have occurred in these trades, the Secretary of State hopes that em-ployers who are still using lead paints will now arrange to dis-continue their use and substitute- paints which comply with the specification drawn up by the Committees.Only paints of the character recommended, by the Committees are now being used by H.M. Office of Works for Government Buildings. Till recently a certain difficulty was experienced in obtaining non-poisonous paints suitable for the priming of iron, but as is shown by the enclosed memorandum drawn up by the Office of Works, this difficulty has now been overcome. For more detailed information on this point,application maybe made to Mr. W. Pott, Principal Architect of the Office of Works.Home Office,Whitehall, S.W.1, June, 1920.(6/20) (29712r-l) Wt. imi-F.D, 30 2000 8/20 H. St. G. 1
MEMORANDUM BY H.M. OFFICE OE WORKSon the mmTEST OE NON-POISONOUS PAINTS EOR &quot;PRIMING&quot; IRON AND STEEL,It is now 12 or 13 years since the Department decided to adopt non-poisonous paints for use on buildings in their charge and the results have been satisfactory.It is found that paints prepared on a base of zinc, iron oxide, etc., with proper mediums, afford quite as good protection to wood and ironwork as paints mixed on a lead base, and the risk of lead poisoning to the&apos; mixers and users of the paint is thereby eliminated.The question was raised by the Home Office Committee on paints in 1911 whether it was not also possible to dispense with red and orange lead as &quot;primers&quot; for iron and steel and to arrive at a decision it was decided to carry out a series of tests at Kew Gardens,These were conducted on about 100 samples supplied by specialist paint firms or mixed to specifications prepared by the Department. They were also tested alongside red and orange lead paints.The pigments used in the samples included lead carbonate, lead oxide, lead chromate, zinc oxide, lithopone, zinc chromate, barium chromate, various iron oxides, graphite, bitumen, -with the usual &quot; extenders&quot; barium sulphate, silica and magnesium silicate, in various proportions.It was recognised that pigment is not the only factor in the composition of paint, the medium being very important in a protective paint film. Linseed oil is the medium most commonly used in the samples but this in many cases had an addition of good varnish, Chinese tung oil or tung oil varnish.The samples were all put on duplicate iron plates which had been thoroughly cleaned and dried in the painters&apos; shop, each sample covering an area of about 12 inches by 4 inches. After two days one plate was exposed to the weather on a wall facing south and the second plate in the warm damp atmosphere of a tropical green-house. The conditions in this latter case were most severe as there was always condensation on the plates and they were often sprayed with water when the plants were receiving attention.The plates were examined once every 12 months over a period of four years by three officers of the Department and marks awarded at each examination.
The best results under the conditions obtaining in the tropical greenhouse were given by the red leads, which gained the first and -fourth places in the list, but mixed paints on bases of zinc and lead mromate were second and third on the list; others with iron oxide, lead zinc and barium chromate, and zinc and iron oxide, were respectively fifth, sixth and seventh on 1he list, and all gave very good results.  Most of these best paints had a special medium.The most important tests, however, from a practical point of view were those of plates exposed to the weather under ordinary conditions.The first places were taken by a black iron oxide paint and a silica-graphite paint these being bracketed equal whilst another silica-graphite paint wa? placed second. Lead chromate paints and mixtures of chromate of lead and zinc, zinc chromate, and lead zinc and barium chromate, all took higli places, as also oxides of iron with and without zinc.The silica-graphite paints were considered suitable for use as, &quot; primers &quot; when followed by similar paint.  They give no tooth for hard finishings and when they are used as finishings are liable to rub off where handled but they are good for bridges, roofs etc.Red lead paint was 17th on the list, under ordinary exposure, thus showing that suitable paints can be obtained that obviate the use of this poisonous material.It should be stated that all the paints referred to were mixed paints as supplied by various makers and the maximum of 5 per cent, of soluble lead, as recommended by the Home Office Committee, was not exceeded.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE.When making preparations for the preceding Session, of the General Conference, the International Labour Office sent out extensive questionnaires to all Governments requesting them to forward all available information concerning the questions on the Agenda. Special stress was laid upon the importance of receiving the most complete information on existing and proposed legisla-tion, and on agreements between employers and workers. Finally, Governments were asked to give their opinion cm the proposed Draft Conventions and Recommendations.This method had two drawbacks:  .(lj Such protracted enquiries were necessitated by this form of questionnaire that the majority of the replies were&apos; received too late to allow of the elaboration of a carefully considered report.(2) Some Governments appeared to consider sufficient the enquiry into existing legislation and the con-ditions which gave rise to it, and failed to realise the necessity of examining carefully the possi-bilities of international action. It was, therefore, impossible for the International Labour Office to form a proper estimate of the objections and difficulties which a draft Convention might encounter.These drawbacks were felt keenly during the last Session, of the Conference at Genoa.  Hence the following new (2023) . A 2
method has been adopted a method made possible by &apos; the development of the Office&apos;: (a) The problem is studied, and existing legislation and available information on the subject are collected by one of the technical services of the International Labour Office. Bequests to Governments for in-formatim or documents are confined to what is needed to complete the information already available.(6) The Office then draws up a questionnaire relating exclusively to the possibility of elaborating Draft Conventions or Recommendations on the question at issue and to the provisions which it may or may not seem necessary or possible to include in them.   The present questionnaire is of this type.(c) When the International Labour Office has received the replies to the questionnaire and is thereby informed of the opinions of the Governments of the various States, it will proceed to draw up a General Report, together with Draft Conventions or Recommendations, to serve as definite bases for the discussions of the Conference. In order ,to facilitate this task the replies to this questionnaire should reach the Office not later than the 1st March, 1921.The preparation of the General Report referred to in paragraph (c) would be facilitated if, where possible, several copies of the replies and important documents in English or French were communicated to the Office. For Federal States answers should be given both for the central Government and for the principal local Governments, in so far as they have legislative authority in this question.
INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE. THIRD SESSION.GENEVA, OCTOBER, 1921.ITEM III (b) OF THE AGENDA.The question of protection against lead-poisoning has already occupied the attention of the International Labour Conference, having formed one of the subjects of consideration at the First Session at Washington in November, 1919. The Commission on Unhealthy Pro-cesses at that Conference included industrial processes in which lead is used among the occupations involving particular risks for women and children. The Con-ference recognised the peculiar risks of lead intoxication, and passed a unanimous recommendation concerning the protection of women and children against lead-poisoning ; this recommendation invited the Members of the International Labour Organisation to prohibit the employment of women and young persons under 18 years of age in certain industries involving serious risk of plumhism.By protecting women and children only, the Confer-ence did not intend it to be understood that it was only these two classes of workers who were exposed to the danger of plumbism. On the contrary, the report of the Commission on Unhealthy; Processes states that lead intoxication &quot; affects men, women and children in industry,&quot; Neither did the Conference intend to limit its recommendation to any definite categories of
industries involving particularly serious risk. It did not clearly and specifically define the extent of protection against lead-poisoning. This is obvious from the fact that Mr. Bidegarray, the -French Workers&apos; Delegate, put forward a motion requesting the Commission on Unhealthy Processes to give its attention to the question of the use of white, lead in house-painting, is this question did not appear on the agenda, it was impossible to deal with it, but the rapporteur &quot; expressed the general feeling of the Commission in pointing out the importance of the subject, and saying how action had already been taken in certain countries and the subject had been studied in others.&quot; The Commission was &quot; of opinion that the. subject should be referred to the International Labour Office to be placed on the agenda at the next Conference.&quot;In order to give effect to this finding, the Governing Body of the International Labour Office placed the -question of the prohibition of the use of white lead in the painting industry on the agenda for the Conference which is to be held in April, 1921.* * * *It is necessary to emphasise the fact that the most dangerous industries in which the worker .is exposed to the danger of lead-poisoning are those in which use is made of lead compounds. A very small quantity of these compounds produces an effect. They easily penetrate the organism by every possible channel and gradually accumulate ; on the other hand, they are eliminated extremely slowly by organs which have in the meantime suffered serious changes. (Kidney affect-tions are particularly common.)
Whatever may have been said to the contrary, lead compounds mixed with oil by hand further increase the possibility of poisoning through the skin.The danger of lead-poisoning in industry is of course not limited to white lead or to painting operations. On the other hand, it is only against the effects of white lead that a successful campaign can be undertaken. Investigations, together with technical and scientific research, have sufficiently demonstrated the possibility of replacing white lead by substitutes.The agenda of the next Conference limits considera-tion of the question to the &quot; prohibition of the use of white lead in painting.&quot; It would, however, be useful to consider the question of lead intoxication in all in-dustries involving the use of lead and lead products.The question of the risks run by painters using white lead has occupied attention for many years, and has been the subject of much discussion between the advocates and opponents of a substitute for carbonate of lead. This discussion will not have been in vain if it succeeds in calling the attention of public authorities to the unfortunate position of workers in white had, particularly house painters, and if it gives rise to effective protective measures.A glance at the enormous number of documents and works of a technical, medical, chemical and legis-lative nature existing on the subject enables an estimate of its complexity to be formed. The abundant evidence, on which it is now possible to base an impartial judg-ment, makes it permissible to say that the question is sufficiently ripe from the technical point of view to form the subject of an international Convention.
THE RISK OF LEAD POISONING.A.-The Medical and Social Aspect. Plumbism is an occupational disease common to all countries, and takes the foremost place in the pathology of labour.The risk accompanying the use of lead in general, and of white lead in particular, is increased by reason of the slow and insidious way in which the poison infects the organism so that the worker feels no preliminary symptoms.It should be remembered that painters, like other workers in many industries, use materials of which they do not understand the composition, and which are sold under numerous trade names. Thus, white lead is variously known as Venice white, Cologne white, Krems white, Dutch white, Tyrol white, Magdeburg white, litho-graphic white, silver white, slate white, pearl white, etc.From the scientific point of view, it is difficult to admit the contention of some investigators (who were not themselves medical men) that &quot; workers who continually make use of white lead are not necessarily infected.&quot; It is a fact that the power of resistance varies with the individual: one worker shows symptoms of poisoning after a few days, another after a few weeks, or a few months; another, on the contrary, only after years. In this connection, it is no longer possible to deny the influence which hygienic habits exercise in retarding the approach of plumbism. There is no doubt that the more unhealthy the process owing to the escape of dust, the more soluble the product, and the larger the amount of dust absorbed or paste manipu-lated, the more rapid the intoxication. Professor Carlson has made a study of the solubility of lead
sulphate and carbonate of lead in the gastric juice. Experiments proved that the solubility of the sulphate was 9 -5 per cent., as against 46 *1 per cent, for white lead, and that for the pure salts the solubility was 26 * 6 per cent, and 64 per cent., respectively.Neither race, age nor sober habits afford immunity from lead-poisoning, which is brought about through the open tracts of the body of which the digestive canal is undoubtedly the most important. The skin also affords a means of entry for the poison, by direct contact. The respiratory canals have only a secondary importance in this connection, and even this is still contested.In the course of heated controversies, use has been made of statistics which, it cannot be denied, do not lead to identical conclusions on this difficult question.&apos; As a matter of fact, the original statistics, in consequence of having been quoted time after time more or less inaccurately, have ended by becoming distorted and falsified and by doing harm to a cause which might have been taken as proved.On the other hand, it must be confessed that certain investigators who were not doctors, have not always seen the problem in its true light, and their conclusions have therefore not always been arrived at with the necessary scientific exactitude.They should have appreciated the necessity of securing a thorough examination of the workers instead of simply stating that &quot; from the point of view of health, their appearance seemed satisfactory,&quot;, or contenting them-selves with sending questionnaires to medical men. On the other hand,, the enquiries conducted by experts in all countries have definitely established the fact that plumbism is a typical, occupational disease, and that

In the first place, there is a considerable increase in the number of diseases of the kidneys, nerves, diges-tive organs, etc., a number largely in excess of the cases specifically classified under the heading of &quot; lead poisoning.&quot; In addition to this, the duration of these maladies and the frequency with which they occur in the case of painters, is much above the average.This is shown by the following figures* of the German Sickness Insurance Funds, comparing the experience of the whole of the Funds (over 20,000) in 1910-1912, with those for painters in Breslau and Leipzig: 
I * Hence whereas the average sickness experience shows 850 days per 100 workers per annum, the experience for painters rises to 1,230 in Breslau and 1,017 in Leipzig.The Berlin painters&apos; sick benefit society, with an average of 4,637 members for the years 1900-1909, had a yearly average of 13-82 days&apos; sick-ness per member, of which 2-86 per cent, were due to lead-poisoning. It should be added that in six years the expenditure in sickness benefit for illness I other than plumbism was 219,192 marks, as against 1,139,093 marks for cases of plumbism.The statistics prepared by the Leipzig sick benefit societies (1910) show 351 cases of lead poisoning amongst 100,000 compulsory members (770 among voluntary members). In the schedule of illnesses due to lead-poisoning classed according to occupations, painters show 60-4 per cent., as compared with 34-8 per cent, for pottery workers and 43 -4 per cent, for printers; 33J per cent, of the diseases, which are divided into fifty classes, affect painters; then follow workers in white lead factories and lead colours with 20 per cent;, lead and zinc foundries, etc. Out of 100 cases of lead poisoning which were observed in Prussian i hospitals during the period 1904-1908, painters showed the highest proportion, followed at some distance by I lead founders and workers in white lead; the average being 34-6 for painters, as against 22-9 for white lead workers and 13 for founders.In England, house painters are not included in the ! list of occupations in which^ notification of occupational disease is compulsory. However, as lead poisoning is occupational in their case, the inspectors have been able to report numbers of instances.  In the ten years
(1900-1909) the total number of cases of lead-poisoninfj among painters was 1,973, of which 383 were fatal. On the other hand, the total number of cases of lead poisoning in other industries coming under the law was as high as 6,762, of which 275 were fatal. The proportion of fatal cases is therefore 4*06 per cent., as against 19 *41 per cent, for painters.The use of lead sulphate instead of white lead has greatly increased in America where. the poisonous properties of the two substances have been much dis-cussed. The Pullman Company, which has always had a large number of workers suffering from lead poisoning, and which took no special precautions to protect them, suddenly substituted lead sulphate in the place of white lead in 1912 at the same time that a law regarding the establishment of a health service and the installation of washing and eating accommodation in unhealthy industries came into force in the State of Illinois. In 1911 there was a monthly average amongst the staff of the Pullman Company of 18 cases of lead-poisoning to 490 workers, but after the replace-ment of white lead the number fell to 6 per month to 650 workers, and the average continued to decrease.In addition to serious investigations and scientific research possessing all the necessary guarantees, there are a number of assertions which were possibly true thirty years ago, and of which polemical use has been made in argument. They have been thereby transformed into absolute formulae which have been and are still repeated everywhere. There is no doubt that grave objection might be made to the method of conducting certain enquiries which very often led to no conclusions because of their incompleteness.
&apos; Experience lias shown that when the attention of rivate or hospital doctors is drawn to the question of ead-poisoning, the statistical results of the investigations lire very different, and that there is no trouble taken in liagnosing the cases.  These superficial opinions have een disastrous to sound preventive treatment.  It must be admitted that the workers almost invariably tell 3lnedical men and investigators that, they have had the fcood fortune to escape the poison.  When pressed, they nsist that they have never suffered from colic or lead aralysis, etc.   On the other hand, methodical examina-ion reveals the ineradicable signs of lead impregnation. The workers and numbers of medical men still believe hat the clinical symptoms of lead-poisoning are con-ined to colic and paralysis.  It is necessary, therefore, iO insist on the main point of the question, which is hat lead-poisoning is not always accompanied by athognomonic symptoms, and it is this difficulty in ;epiagnosis, especially on a superficial examination, which &apos;S nay have led certain medical men to deny the existence )f lead-poisoning.The doctor should always ask the occupation of the rorker, and if he does this, the first symptoms of lead-ic loisoning rarely escape him on an examination. Further, k t is necessary to ascertain how many sick persons, -ie reated for various maladies, are in reality cases of 3iJead-poisoning, and how many cases of lead-poisoning 3clave inadvertently escaped medical diagnosis. As a. illatter of fact, the sick worker&apos; does not consult the vtj octor until the acute symptoms of advanced poisoning lanifest themselves, since in the majority of cases only causes, during long years, a more or less marked ndition of anoemia, after which the evil, latent until.n
that point, suddenly shows itself owing to some outsidl circumstance. These workers, who very often do not . show even &quot; the blue line,&quot; are infected by lead poison, and examination of their blood often allows of the diagnosis of plumbism, even during the latent period.Finally, alcoholism plays a prominent part in the pathogeny of lead-poisoning. Certain writers have advanced the theory that abstinent workers are more affected than the others, but there is no reliable evidence to support this assertion.Labour legislation neither can, nor should^ be inspired by a principle which would divide the workers into &quot; skilled workers &quot; and &quot; manual workers &quot; or &quot; casual workers,&quot; with the object of arriving at the conclusion that it is not necessary to make a law to protect the second category. The fact should not be lost sight of that in many cases it is a question of taking special protective measures for certain categories of persons, and against certain compounds which are particularly injurious. If, owing to the use of substitutes, the use of the harmful compound can be prohibited, then pro-hibitive regulations are highly desirable.. Such is the case as regards the employment of white lead in painting.In conclusion, it may be said:  * (1) Science, in investigating the relation between diseases and occupations, has ascertained and proved that lead poisoning is in the front rank of social diseases and constitutes a veritable social scourge, which ought to be fought with the greatest energy. (2) The campaign should be carried out scientifically and methodically, since lead-poisoning appears to respect persons whose excretory organs function
normally and who observe a strict personal hygiene.(3) From the point of view of strict prevention, every person exposed to the risk of lead-poisoning should be considered as a possible case of lead-poisoning.B-The Peevention or Lead-Poisoning. The campaign against lead-poisoning was opened by propaganda having for its object the education of the persons concerned (employers and workers), and people have chosen to believe, as was only too easy, that the number of cases of lead-poisoning decreased owing to the distribution of leaflets, the compulsory installation of washing accommodation, etc. It cannot be denied that education plays an important part in the campaign against occupational diseases. In particular, the useful -ness of preventive measures cannot be contested when industries are in question in which the measures to be taken against lead-poisoning may be confined to energetic intervention in the processes of production and to permanent action by inspectors with a view to ensuring strict adherence to che regulations.Statistics prove unmistakably that a decrease in lead-poisoning among printers, workers in red-lead factories and even among white-lead workers, has been noticed in permanent workshops where preventive measures have been taken. Employers and managers of certain well-organised factories have voluntarily taken excellent hygienic measures. They have allowed the workers the time and means to keep themselves clean; they have distributed rations of milk, with the two-fold object of fighting alcoholism and of increasing the resistance of the organism to poisoning. These measures, however, have onlv been taken in factories; they are not
applicable in the case of yards or small industries where!the working employer has neither the interest nor themeans to carry out even the most modest measures of individual hygiene, and where it is easy to evaderestrictive measures which are, furthermore,  quiteineffective in practice. Any control of hygienic measures is impossible in thecase of painters and workers in similar occupationswhere places of work are scattered. Preventive measures to be at all efficacious as regardslead-poisoning in the painting industry could hardlyconsist of other than the following : (1) Compulsory notification of occupational lead-poisoning, since the appreciation of the danger is the indispensable basis of precautionary measures;(2) Prohibition of the sale of white lead other than in the form of a paste.(3) Placing on the market colours ready for use, since the preparation of colours by painters themselves is a grave source of risk of plumbism.These measures are, nevertheless, notoriously in-sufficient. The risk of infection by lead-poisoning among painters and workers in similar trades assumes exceedingly dangerous proportions. The preventive measures referred to can only Be accepted in the absence of something better, for the painter&apos;s occupation calls for the maximum amount of protection possible.After long experience in the Vienna Sick Benefit Societies, Dr. Teleky, advising medical officer for occu-national diseases, came to the conclusion (1913) that the marked diminution in lead-poisoning amongst working
painters was due, not to the application of preventive regulations, but simply to the prohibition of the use of lead colours for indoor work.The only really efficacious measure of which the appli-cation could be controlled would be the absolute prohibition of the use of colours with a white lead basis.Such a radical measure could not, however, be intro-duced if colours with a white lead basis could not be replaced by innocuous substances equally good from the technical point of view. All experts agree at the present time on this point, that the substitution of white lead by harmless substances- is possible. This is being carried out to a large extent, even for outdoor work.C. The Technical Aspect.The proposal to replace white lead by zinc whites and other innocuous substitutes nevertheless still meets with lively opposition.The fundamental problem is to determine whether the use of white lead in house-painting should or should not- be prohibited by law. The results of enquiries may be classified as follows: (a) Those which only demand special regulations ; (o) Those which recommend prohibition for indoor work;(c) Those which imply prohibition for both outdoor and indoor work.It should not be forgotten that the campaign in favour of the prohibition of the use of white lead originated in France. The quantity of reports and documents of a technical, medical, commercial and(2023t) b
legislative nature, published in France is enormous, and the controversy between those in favour of liberty and prohibition respectively has become classical.As early as 1808, Fourcroy, Bertholet and Vauque-lin, the academicians, were called upon to advise on the respective values of white lead and zinc white,- and concluded their report by stating that &quot; the disadvan-tages of using zinc white are so small as compared with the disadvantages of using white lead that no one can reasonably refuse to adopt it, at any rate for house-painting. The colours which it produces are clearer and more distinct; it does not lose its brilliance; quantity for quantity, it covers a larger surface, etc.&quot;Experiments seemed to prove that zinc white paints covered less than white lead paints, and that &quot; snow white &quot; covered less than zinc white paints. However, weight for weight, zinc white covers a larger surface than white lead.Good painting should fulfil the following requirements, which are quoted in order of importance : 1. Covering Power. This is the quality which is generally attributed to white lead and found lacking in zinc white. In reality, this quality of covering power and that of resistance to atmospheric agencies were not admitted in zinc white up to 1907-1910, and it was&apos; maintained that though zinc oxide might replace white lead in a large number of cases (in practice the use of zinc oxide was already common), yet white lead could not be completely replaced by zinc oxide.In working with a pure substance, mixing with oil gave a liquid paint in consequence of the molecular composition of zinc oxide ; so that, in order to cover a
surface with, the least possible amount of solid matter, it was necessary to dilute it less or to give three coats of zinc white for two of white lead. - As a result of improvements in manufacture of oxides of zinc in particular, the solution of the problem is easier to-day than formerly, and it may be said that the strongest objection which was made to the use of zinc whites has been overcome.The placing on the market of plumbous zinc whites constitutes further progress from the technical point of view, and at the present time the results obtained with them are quite as satisfactory as those obtained with white lead paint.Successive experiments carried out in Belgium, in Denmark, and in America have shown that zinc white containing from 2 to 4 per cent, of basic sulphate of lead has greater covering power than white lead.It is now established that slightly plumbous zinc white &quot;kills&quot; from two to four times more black or blue than white lead, and that this is due to its special method of manufacture and to the amorphous condition of its molecules, rather than to its actual lead content. This very complex question, which is also at the same time a problem of physics and molecular chemistry, will be examined later.2. Solidity.   The comparative experiments made with pure zinc whites lead to the conclusion that for interiors they are much superior to white lead and as good for exterior use; for wood, they are equally good either for interior or exterior use (Milan 1907-1908).White lead is not better than zinc whites from the point of view of resistance to atmospheric changes (2023t) b 2
2Gand especially to sulphuretted vapours and certain^ oxidising agents.The same excellent results have been obtained by the North-East Painting and Oil Trade Association (Eng-land), in the painting of buildings, vehicles and the interiors of railway stations, in the work executed by the Admiralty since 1907, and especially, by the Office of Works (England).The fact should never be lost sight of that in order to ensure good outside paint work, it is important not to use the same oxide of zinc or the same elements as are used for lead paint.The technical expert now knows the proportions and formulae for the different kinds of paint-work (buildings, wood, metal, etc.), mastics, covering coats, etc.3. Grinding in Oil. The good results obtained with white lead paints used to be attributed to the presence in them of lead oxide reacting on the free acids in the linseed oil. A homogeneous compound was thus ob-tained, stable and resistent, which is certainly a lead-oleate with a polish which is hard, impermeable and very resistent to atmospheric influence.Zinc whites on the contrary, would only be a mixture of a passive solid (zinc oxide) with a liquid (oil). All the experts now agree in saying that oxides of zinc re-act just as well on the free acids in linseed oil, and the difference in the quality, as pigments, of zinc colours and lead colours is rather due to physical differences than to the results of chemical reactions.Plumbous oxide of zinc combines very easily with oil. This product, rarely pure white in the powdered state, nevertheless lends increased whiteness when ground.  Technical experts state that the greater the
Jmiscibility of a colour with oil, the greater its solidity and power of resistance. From this fact results the special suitability of this form for painting ships.This is the conclusion arrived at by the principal ex-perts of the London Paint and Varnish Society, by the United States Paint Manufacturers&apos; Association, by the Washington Institute of Industrial Research (1912), by the English Special Commission (1918), and by the Dutch Commission. This last, charged in 1909 with making an enquiry into questions relative to the prohibi-tion of the use of white lead, reported, after five years spent in study and comparative experiments with white lead, lithopones, pure zinc and plumbous zinc, that the last was superior to all the other substances from the point of view of durability,&apos; covering power and cheap-ness, although chemical analysis was not favourable thereto.4. Fumes. The question as to whether freshly applied white lead paints emit lead fumes capable of causing absorption of lead by the respiratory organs has not been answered in the affirmative, as stated by Beethelot.The researches of Baly and other English experts have discredited the presence of lead, but have demon-demonstrated, on the other hand, that of an oxidised product of linseed oil (non-saturated aldehydes).It is not the same with zinc-white paints. This substance was supposed to be responsible for cases of arsenical poisoning occurring amongst workers occupying offices freshly painted with zinc white ; but this accusations-tion was withdrawn, as it was proved to be a question of collective arsenophobia (Sweden).5. Drying Qualities. White lead possesses a very high drying-power, greater than that of zinc whites.
It suffices, however, to add to the latter a very small j quantity (1 to 3 per cent.) of a drying compound in order to obtain a paint as good as that obtained with white lead (this was the experience of the Annexe to the Pasteur Institute). Plumbous zinc whites have superior drying powers and give a coat of paint which is less liable to &quot; crackle &quot; than does white lead.6. Method of Use. A criticism commonly directed against zinc white is based on the practical difficulty of using it. The simple truth is that every working painter has his own methods and does not care to change them and to have to accustom himself to the new trick of mixing, even though it is easily acquired.7. Tints. Even the opponents of zinc whites have always admitted that they yield tints of an unfading whiteness and freshness,which makes them much superior for interior decoration to white lead, which is liable to turn yellow, especially when it is not exposed to the light. This is illustrated by the results obtained by a Dutch contractor who painted the interior of his house with zinc white and reported that after nine years the paint was still in good condition (English Eeport, 1918). Zinc white paint becomes very hard, is easily polished, does not become sulphuretted by vapour and resists the influence of lighting gas.8. Cheapness. Experiments have shown that zinc white is superior for indoor work as regards tint and covering power (France, Switzerland, Italy and Holland), and that it is preferable also for outdoor work on wood and iron (Milan). Before the war, plumbous zinc white rendered possible a saving of 15 per cent, as compared with white lead. During an enquiry made in England in 1918 the saving effected was, according to
% witnesses, as high as 10 per cent. &apos; In any case, it is very probable that an increased demand would lead to a decrease in price.Plumbous Zinc White.Oxides of zinc are obtained industrially by various processes, but chiefly by the direct process (treatment of the ores), or the indirect method (treatment of the metal). The preparation of zinc white by the direct method does not eliminate impurities or yield a chemically pure substance, as can be done by other methods, particularly the indirect. However, this advantage is of no value from the technical point of view. On the contrary, the white obtained by the direct method is much superior as regards freshness of tint, the ease with which it can be applied with the brush, its covering power, the facility with which it combines with linseed oil and its excellent adhering qualities.Whilst in the past an impurity of 1 per cent, was accepted, to-day chemical knowledge permits an allow-ance of 4 per cent., while further improving the pigment and effecting an economy of about 15 per cent.It is important to emphasise the fact that the maxi-mum of 4 per cent, cannot be exceeded for technical reasons. If lead is combined with zinc white in larger proportions, the darkening which is noticeable increases in proportion to the percentage of lead ; there is also an increase in opaqueness due to the action of essence of turpentine.Plumbous zinc white is an oxide of zinc containing a small proportion of basic lead sulphate which is not
precipitated or mechanically mixed with the zinc white, but is obtained by sublimation of the ore in the furnace itself simultaneously with zinc oxide, so that every molecule of zinc oxide is, so to speak, impregnated with a small quantity of lead salts.It should be stated without hesitation that there can be no question of suppressing the use of white lead in order to adopt in its place a substance containing lead which &quot; would not be as innocuous as people wished to imply.&quot;However, given the condition in which the small quantity of basic sulphate of lead is found, this element could not have harmful effects. This is proved by the periodical enquiries of the Labour Medical Inspection Service of the Dutch Government, whose strictness in this matter must be admitted, although the sanitary conditions in the factories are not remarkably good.Experiments made since 1907 in the painting shops of the Belgian State Railways, as regards both indoor and outdoor work, in order to obtain a substance which would resist bad weather as well as smoke, led to the same conclusion.It is true that many painters add white lead to zinc white in a proportion of 2 to 5 per cent. It is important, however, to remember that a mechanical mixture of 2 to 4 per cent, of carbonate of lead with pure zinc whites does not yield the same result as a mixture with plumbous zinc white. In order to have this molecular condition, it is essential that the zinc oxide should be produced in an atmosphere in which lead is present and where every particle of oxide of zinc is closely combined in infinitesimal proportions with lead salts. From this results a marked modification in the microcrystalline
% condition which is more easily brought about during oxidisation in the presence of lead salts than in their absence.Practical Experience. The importance of the results to be obtained by the use of zinc white and especially the plumbous variety, even in outdoor work, has already been demonstrated.In consequence of general experiments made with specially pure zinc whites (99 *07 parts pure), and in view of the favourable results obtained with substitutes for white lead and also of the great importance of the question from the point of view of health, enquiries undertaken in France, Belgium, Italy, England, etc., resulted in the prohibition of the use of white lead in the painting of interiors. It was ascertained in 1910 that the use of white lead was prevalent in Northern Italy, while south of Florence, for technical and economic reasons, zinc white has been successfully used for many years to paint buildings, bridges and vehicles.The same enquiry also revealed the fact that many contractors (20 out of 50 who were interrogated) made successful use of zinc white &quot; in order not to end like father.&quot; The others declared that they preferred to work in the old style, while admitting that the lack of success in work done with zinc white for government     departments was easily explained by the fact that the official contract price per square metre was too low and consequently the work could not be properly done. The enquiries carried out by the Statistical office i attached to the Austrian Ministry of Labour and the Chamber of Commerce of Southern Austria, and the opinions of numerous experts, have been favourable toI  the prohibition of the use of white lead for indoor work.I     (5640) b3
As regards outside work, investigations and expert opinions (except those of Vienna), have also led to the conclusion that a substitute can be found for white lead. It has been said, and rightly, that even if the technical advantages derived from the use of substitutes were not such as practice and experience has proved them to be, their resistance to bad weather could easily be increased by adding another coat of varnish. As Dr. Tbleky said, &quot; one coat of varnish is better than many cases of lead-poisoning.&quot;Experiments carried out during three years by the American Paint Manufacturers&apos; Association (U.S.A.) in Atlantic City and North Dakota, confirm the inferiority of results obtained from zinc white in comparison with those obtained from plumbous zinc whites. The Italian State Railways have used these special plumbous zinc whites for about 10 years.It is to be noted that the contracts of Government Departments in France*, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden and Holland, etc., while prescribing the exclusive use of zinc oxide as the result of pressure from the painters&apos; associations which had demanded the prohibition of white lead, have all raised the percentage of lead salts from 1 per cent, to 4 per cent.Finally, although the use of white lead has not been regulated in Sweden, and although there are neither white lead nor zinc white factories there, the painters have long preferred zinc white. In fact, the con-sumption of zinc white has increased in six years from 3,022 tons to 4,244 tons, whilst that of white lead has decreased from 511 tons to 501 tons.* In 1911 the Ministry of War raised the percentage of lead from 2 per cent, to 3 per cent.
Other Substitutes for White Lead.(a) Amongst substitutes for white lead, mention should be made, after zinc whites, of &quot; lithopones,&quot; which for nearly fifty years, thanks to the technical progress made in France, Germany and England, have been well to the fore among colours in general use for indoor work. These are composed, as is well-known, of sulphide of zinc and barium sulphate, precipitated in the proportion of 29 to 30 per cent, of the former to 70 to 71 per cent, of the latter, in which mixture there is no trace of natural barytes or any impurity of any kind. These substitutes are innocuous and answer all requirements from the technical point of view (fresh-ness, whiteness of tint, covering power superior to that of white lead and. solidity, when the compounds are perfect and of guaranteed origin). In view of the care required in their manipulation if good results are desired, they are not particularly suitable for outdoor work.(b) For some years past there has been going on in England an increasing manufacture of wonderful&quot; water-paints,&quot; intended specially for indoor work; the best results can, however, only be arrived at by the use, as a basis, of an irreproachable lithopone specially pre-pared for the purpose.(c) The trade has also put on the market compounds with a basis of zinc sulphides which require special preparation, and other compounds with which we are not concerned for the moment and which naturally have their advocates and opponents.
Conclusions.It is agreed that every possible means must be made use of to instil in the minds of all persons concerned the firm conviction that they can themselves do much for the preservation of their health. But though it is possible to -diminish the danger of lead-poisoning in a considerable degree by the action of the interested persons, and that of the representatives of the national government, no regulation of. the use of white lead can be effective without the willing assistance of all. Un-fortunately, the application of an efficient preventive of lead-poisoning is especially difficult in the very industry where it is most needed that is, in house-painting. The best regulations are only valuable in so far as they are applied. These simple measures of precaution cannot be applied in scattered workshops with sufficient rigour to assure the efficacy of a law.The highly detailed system of regulations proposed by a minority of the opponents of the absolute prohibi-tion of the use of white lead in painting must be con-sidered from a strictly practical point of view. For -example, they demand, in the case of certain specially dangerous work, such as rubbing down and scraping, a reduction in the hours of labour, the exclusion of apprentices, the use of respiratory masks, and so on. It seems, however, hardly possible to put these proposi-tions into actual practice.The choice lies between entire prohibition and no prohibition. If the use of white lead in painting be dangerous, it is impossible to limit the prohibition at first to a part of the process, and to extend it to the other part only after an interval of two or three years.
^Neither is it practicable to distinguish between indoor and outdoor work. The distinction is specious; there are forms of work which are intermediate, and it is impossible to lay down an exact delimitation between them. Moreover, if white lead be dangerous for the indoor painter, it is dangerous also for his fellow out of doors.Though the minority of the Commissions of Enquiry hold that the evidence collected does not indicate the absolute necessity of  substituting  zinc  white for  white lead in outdoor work, the majority in the various countries consider that the demand for the prohibition of the use of white lead in house-painting is sufficiently justified, by the argument arising from considerations of the health of the workers and that there is no necessity to cite the favourable evidence of experience, the technical results obtained by house-painters, civil and maritime engineers and the State workshops (in Belgium, Italy, etc.) and the approbation of a large number of both employers and workers-The manufacture and application of white leadsubsti-tutes have, moreover, made such progress that the prohibition of the use of white lead can now be envisaged without anv fear of its results.  The numerous and minute researches which have been made in many-countries for many years past have placed it beyond doubt that oxide of zinc, properly treated, can be used, as the basis of a product giving every advantage given by white lead, whether in covering power, drying qualities or durability.  It is, moreover, certain that an increase in the demand for it will result in an improve-ment in the zinc white now marketed, and will cause search to be made for even more effective products.
Care and intelligent attention will ensure that results! as good as those obtained from the best white lead are obtained from this compound.It is necessary to add that it is only the legal restric-tion of the use of white lead which is proposed. It would still be used in work other than that of painting, under certain conditions which must be laid down.The prohibition of the use of white lead in painting ought also to be accompanied by provisions of a transitory nature, taken in consideration of the interests of manu-facturers.In France, on the occasion of the prohibition of the use of white lead, the question was raised of the in-demnity to be given to the owners of white lead works. But the Senate, which had at first introduced into the law a clause granting indemnities, finally rejected this proposal.  In this connection it should be pointed out that there is here no question of expropriation, and there cannot therefore be any question of an indemnity. It may now be said that legislation everywhere has proceeded on the principle that measures limiting industrial freedom with a view to the protection of the life or the health of workers do not give occasion for indemnities.  The prohibition of the use of phosphorus is a case in point.  The protection of human health rises above all other considerations.  In any case, to accord an indemnity would be to - set up a very dangerous precedent.

International Labour  Conference GENEVA, 1921Item III (b) of Agenda&quot;The   Prohibition   of  the   use  of White Lead in Painting&quot;CASE AGAINST PROHIBITION
INTRODUCTORY.i -On the Agenda for the International Labour Conference to be held at Geneva in 1921, is an item  &quot; The prohibition of the use of white lead in painting.&quot;This Statement has been prepared by the British makers of white lead to show that Prohibition is the wrong way of dealing with the question of poisoning among painters.The argument which is set out in the following pages may be summarised as follows: I. There is no evidence, statistical, medical, chemical or technical, to warrant the extreme measure of the Prohibition of the use of white lead for /pa%nt%ny.II-Prohibition of the use of white lead in painting would be enormously costly to the community and would have disastrous effects on Home and Imperial interests. It would be difficult to enforce and of doubtful effect.III. The risk of poisoning in painting can be effectively dealt with by simple Regulations to avoid the dangers of dust and the vapour of turpentine, etc., and to ensure cleanliness.
The question of lead poisoning is one which has given rise to exceptionally embittered and reckless con-troversy. The controversy is especially associated witl( France, where it assumed the character of a violent political warfare, culminating in the prohibition of the I use of white lead for painting by the Law of 20th July, 1909, a law which was to come into force in July, 1915. but was suspended during the war, and has not yet been put into force. So far as can be judged by outsiders, I the circumstances which led up to the passing of the French Law of Prohibition justified the comment of the Geneva Commission of 1.907, that the discussion &quot; was not fully invested with that character of objectivity and calm which is necessary for the study of such a j question,&quot; and again, adopting the.words of a critic, &quot;Id I the French campaign against white lead there were seen intrigues, betrayals, the opposition of industrial and commercial interests, political and journalistic manoeuvres, enquiries and counter-enquiries, even the pitiable ex-lhbition of true and false cases of lead poisoning, even the multiplication and subtraction of corpses of victims of lead.&quot;  (&quot;La Ceruse,&quot; Geneva, Kiindig, 1907, p. 4.)In England a Home Office Departmental Committee was appointed in 1911, and the Majority Eeport, in 1914, recommended the prohibition of the use of paint contain-ing more than 5 per cent, of its dry weight of a soluble lead compound (Cmd. 7882), This will not impress anyone who is familiar with the bureaucratic origins and procedure of that Committee, or who lias read the Minority Report Further, much more is now known of the hygiene of the painter&apos;s trade than was known at the time of that enquiry.On the other hand, official enquiries in other European countries, viz., Austria, Belgium, Geneva (Canton), Germany and Switzerland, resulted in the find-ings that the proper way of dealing with the problem was by way of Regulations.
it.s;eK.1-less1(1le of aterVid-am!The question of lead poisoning came before the first international Labour Conference held at Washington in November, 1919, in regard to the employment of women and young persons in lead processes, a subject which was dealt with by the Committee on Unhealthy Processes.   At. the suggestion of this Committee, tho Conference passed a Recommendation for the absolute exclusion of women and young persons (i.e., under 18 years old) from certain specially dangerous lead process-&apos; es such as the manufacture of white lead, smelting, etc., in which, indeed, they were in England scarcely employed at all.   The Recommendation also proposed certain regulations preventive of lead dust as a condition of the employment of women and young persons in other lead processes.   It is worth pointing out, as illustrating the danger of such international legislation, that the Women and Young Persons (Employment in Lead Processes) iBill which was introduced in the British Parliament to 1 ive effect to the Recommendation, and followed it erbatim, had to be amended in the House of Lords tecause, as drafted, it would have excluded women and young persons from many processes which are harmless since in them there is no exposure to lead dust of wluble lead compounds, which is the real source of lead poisoning.A. French Labour delegate, who was a member of he Committee on Unhealthy Processes at Washington, tried to get that Committee to deal with the question of lie general prohibition of the use of white lead in paint-ng, but did not succeed because this question was not n the Agenda. The Chairman of the Committee on Jnhealthy Processes, however, informed the Conference hat it was the desire of the Committee that the subject f the prohibition of the use of white lead in painting lould be put on the Agenda for the next Conference igether with the subjects of carbonic oxide gas poison-ig; anthrax infection; and the use of nitrate of mercury i &quot;carrotting&quot; by hatters&apos; furriers; it was also ^commended that all countries should make notification cases of lead poisoning compulsory.   The same
Committee also recommended the formation of a Health Section of the International Labour Office to keep hi touch with the Medical Departments of the Government ! offices charged with the application of factory laws. Upon the danger of purely bureaucratic action in this respect being pointed out, a resolution was unanimously passed by the Washington Conference that &quot;an Advisory Committee on which the Governments, the Employers and the Workers, shall all be represented, shall be appointed without delay to keep in touch with the work of the Health Section of the International Labour Organisation.&quot;It appears from the Bulletin of the International Labour Office dated 6th October, 1920, that the Health Section, the establishment of which was recommended at Washington, was then only recently constituted, and that Prof. Luigi Carozzi had then only just arrived at I Geneva in order to take up his duties as Director of the I Section, and the Bulletin further stated that the Health I Section &quot;will&quot; study the questions which the Committee on Unhealthy Processes at the Washington Conference decided should be put on the Agenda for the next Conference.Notwithstanding the position thus indicated, the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, at its session in March, 1920, put upon the Agenda for Geneva two questions only of those referred to the next Conference, viz., the question of anthrax infection of wool, and the question of the prohibition of the use of white lead in painting. No steps have been taken in regard to the appointment of the Advisory Committee which the Washington Conference unanimously resolved should be constituted.There is, therefore, ground for serious protest as to the irregular way in which the subject of the prohibition of the use of white lead in painting has thus been brought forward, before the necessary and prescribed preliminaries have been taken or the evidence has been collected.
THE MEMORANDUM OF THE INTERNATIONALfLABOUR OFFICE.8.isiym Hi illThere has been issued by the International Labour-Office a Memorandum on the subject of this item of the Agenda for the Geneva Conference, 1921.   This is addressed to the Governments of the various States which take part in the International Labour Conference, and contains a Questionnaire on the subject for answer *\by them.  This document is presumably intended to be 1 Sonsidered as a fair and impartial statement of the facts u jf the cas?, after careful study by the international Labour Office and by its Health Section, and to be used is such by the various Governments in considering their 1 uiswer to tne Questionnaire, and by the representatives eSf the various States when the subject is under dis-&apos; jussiori at the Geneva Conference.  It is deplorable that ? n fact it is, as will be seen upon even a cursory perusal L. j)f it, a piece of advocacy prejudging the whole question, )ased upon false assumptions of fact, and supported by fallacious and even ridiculous arguments.   The docu-nc nent displays the worst arts of shallow advocacy: (i) In ex ts overstatement, not to say mis-statement, of the facts , ivhich support the policy which it urges, and in its Somewhat embarrassed depreciation of such of the facts &apos; &apos;)f contrary significance as it chooses to notice; and (ii) in [ lie evasion and misrepresentation of the arguments and ie])proposals put forward by those who ask for the institu-1 ion of reasonable Regulations of the painting industry. e t is indeed in parts indistinguishable from a piece of ?. iropaganda of the merits of a particular pigment. l, &apos;   Perhaps the most striking example of the partisan ;haracter of this document is the question-begging ssuniption in the first item of the Questionnaire : &quot;in *?i iew of the fact that it is now technically possible to eplace White Lead in painting by efficient substitutes.&quot; ..e t is right that the facts bearing on this phase of the r* [ueStion should be before the various Governments men considering their attitude, but it is indefensible bat they should be invited to consider the matter upon
this prejudged statement of a most controversial question.It is clear that in the short time since its establish! men! (October, 1920) the Health Section of the Inter-national Labour Office has not been able to give sufficient study to this question so as to present a careful summary of the facts. The document illustrates the unfortunate consequences of the failure of the International Labour Office to establish and consult the Advisory Committee of representatives of Governments, employers and workers which the Washington Conference unanimously resolved should be constituted so as to avoid just such bureaucratic action as this.It is not convenient to deal with the arguments and statements in this Memorandum of the International Labour Office in the order and manner in which they are presented by it. They will be found to be dealt with fully, and, it is hoped, frankly and fairly, in the following statement of the Case against Prohibition. It will suffice to say here that the policy of the prohibition of the use of White Lead in painting which is advocated by this Memorandum is based upon two assumptions which are both ill-founded: fl) That there is a heavy incidence of lead poisoning among painters due to the use of White Lead paint which can only be removed by the prohibition of the use of White Lead ; (2) That there are effective substitutes for White Lead for all purposes of painting &apos; It is, however, not out of place to point out some of the more striking examples of partisan advocacy which are to be found in this Memorandum : 1. In regard to the treatment of the Medical aspect of the question the following points may be mentioned:-(a) The expression of regret as to the lack of precision in the diagnosis of lead poisoning conceals the essential facts of the matter, namely, that the symptoms which are characteristic of lead poisoning are not specific ; that it is generally recognised by medical men who have
,llstudied the question that the diagnosis of load poisoning is a matter of. extreme difficulty and one requiring Special knowledge; that many symptoms, formerly ascribed to lead poisoning, are now known to be due to it other constituents of paint, and in particular to the y effects of turpentine ; and that the tendency to attribute ,&apos;e symptoms to lead poisoning in the case of any one li known to be a worker in lead vitiates the whole of the ;e statistics of lead poisoning. (b) The order of d importance given to the channels of infection of lead [y poisoning is directly contrary to authoritative British iopinion, in particular in giving &quot;only a secondary importance to the respiratory canals,&quot; and this over-looks the most salient feature of the matter, namely, that the chief, if not the sole, causative agent of lead pohoning is lead dust, a fact which is of supreme id mportance in considering the possibility and method of Lalthe prevention of lead poisoning by Regulations, ey p) An example of obviously fallacious reasoning is the th)omparison of the ratio of death to sickness among Qg)ainters in England as compared with the similar ratio illimong workers in the regulated load industries. This oiwerlooks the fact that the notification of cases of lead byickness among painters is not compulsory (as it is for chhe regulated industries) and that the figure of cases ice if lead poisoning among painters upon which the itiE alculation is based is wholly fortuitous, a circum-Lontance which invalidates the calculation. Upon the iyeiasis taken by this Memorandum the lead sickness g, attack rate among painters would work out at the , o: ery low figure of 1*31 per 1,000 per annum. Less&apos; iclasty perusal of the Report of the English Departmental Committee on the use of lead compounds in painting ,eci3md; 7882) would have shown that Dr. Legge, H.M.feclical Inspector of Factories, did not suggest that the i h initio of deaths to sickness was any higher among painters ictiian among the regulated lead industries (page 4), and arOat this Committee stated that &quot; The rates of deaths and t ii Hacks due to lead poisoning among house painters are aviws comparatively smalV (page 78).   Of a similar class
itsit)nIdc sr st L63hiof reasoning is the ascription of the diminution of case of lead poisoning among the staff of the Pullman Co. oiL America to the replacement of white lead by leab sulphate, ignoring the fact that this replacement coincides with the establishment of proper regulations.   In this part of the polemic of the International Labour Office one is reminded of the famous calculation of the annual number of cases of lead sickness in Paris hospitals givei in the course of the French controversy by M. Poirier who for his calculation took the number of cases in 1 &apos;arii hospitals on one day, viz. 43 and obtained the annua number, 15,695, by multiplying this figure by 865.2. In regard to the ri echnical aspect, it must suffice here to state that the reasons given for considering tha1 there are effective substitutes for white lead, and ii particular for the advocacy of the superiority of plumbous zinc white, are wholly denied and are contrary to the general practice of painters, as shewn by their preferencf for white lead.3. The author of the Memorandum displays his ignor ance of the Economic aspect of the matter by his egregiou statement that ,(it is very probable that an increase! demand for plumbous zinc white would lead to decrease in price.&quot;4. The proposals of the advocates of Eegulations al the effective means of dealing with poisoning amon[ painters are ingeniously misrepresented by the sup pression of the main feature of this policy, namely, tbl prohibition of the process of dry rubbing down or dr] scraping of paint. This proposal is directed to the chie source of danger, namely, dust, and these are thf processes most productive of dust. This policy has tb support of nearly all the European Commissions whicl have investigated the subject, and is entirely practicabl from a technical point of view.-       1      1 -.../-.....It is to be regretted that many of the statements i the Memorandum of the International Labour official should be such as to suggest that the Office has allowej
3Sjtself to be influenced by representations from interested Qfcarties,l&quot;  The League of Nations is the hope of the world^against the collapse of civilisation.  Great harm will beLlsdone to it if the International Labour organisationC( should be associated with reckless and irresponsibleia statements such as the Memorandum of the Internationalei Labour Office, or should be under suspicion of being3r exploited by particular industries under the guise ofni uumanitarianism. 1a101a ii )ii thqcl01 ohse3s3.on nil tl di hi tl tl hi( :abts)ffij)wj
I.-There is no evidence, statistical,  medical, chemical or technical, to warrant the extremm measure of the Prohibition of the use oil White Lead for Painting.STATISTICAL. 1There is no evidence that painting with white lead j causes more than an ordinary industrial risk among painters, and it is now ascertained that industrial sick- f ness among painters is largely due to causes other than I lead, which causes would not be removed by Prohibition.It is recognised that the symptoms which are charac-teristic of lead poisoning are not specific, and that the diagnosis of lead poisoning is a matter of extreme dim- j f culty and one requiring special knowledge. In the examination of workers Avho are brought into contact with lead in any form there is, and has been, a tendency for practitioners, not specially experienced, to attribute to lead poisoning, without further investigation, certain symptoms which in the case of other workers would I have been differently ascribed. There can be no doubt that the statistics of lead poisoning, both for deaths and also for cases of sickness, have been swollen on this account. (See Appendix I., p. i.) In particular, recent investigations in England and other countries suggest that many of the cases which were formerly diagnosed as lead poisoning are caused by the inhalation of vapours of Turpentine or other volatile tiiinners which are common to most paints and are not peculiar to those with a lead base. (See Appendix II., p. xii.)As regards England, it may be said that there are no reliable statistics of lead poisoning among painters either for deaths or for sickness. The number of house-painters in Great Britain may be taken to be about 150,000. The figures as to Deaths are unreliable for the reasons indicated above, which are set out in greater detail in Appendix I. p. i, There are no figures of Sickness, because house-painting does not come under the Factory Acts, and there is there-
j fore no compulsory notification. Such returns of cases &apos; of sickness as are made are entirely fortuitous, and any Hstimate based upon them is conjectural. T\ Mortality Statistics. Nevertheless, taking the figures of deaths among house-painters as if they were accurate, they show that the painter&apos;s life is not subject to more than an ordinary industrial risk, and that the death rates are, indeed, lower than in many occupations not usually con-Isidered especially dangerous.First, as to the general health position of the painter. Mr. J. IT. Schooling, the well-known statistician, has 3ompared the painter&apos;s risk with that of the other occupations as shown in the Registrar-Generals Report or 1908 (Cd. 2619), and has stated that the figures ihew that the mortality among painters &quot;is in no way u excessive or abnormal: it has been decreasing as rapidly i&apos;or more rapidly than the mortality of England and f Wales, and there is a very Large number of most &apos; varied occupations, many of which are believed to be 1 ordinarily healthy in which the mortality exceeds&quot; hat of painters.In particular, upon splitting the different occupations ip into seven age periods, he found that death rates *jjf the painters&apos; group were lower at every age period n&apos;Jhan those of the group &quot; Occupied Males, industrial iglistricts of England and Wales,&quot; a group comprising eiver 8,000,000 lives, and one with,which the painters&apos; 0I roup  may  most justly  be  compared   (see  Ap-k enclix I., p. iv.)   If this comparison with other occupa-^0 ons be extended for the different age periods, it is jen that there are at all age periods many occupations 0 Inch are not considered to be exposed to undue risk in )rj)spect of which the death rates are the same or are heater.   (See Appendix L, p. v.)dNext, looking at the figures of deaths which are put iwn to lead poisoning, the death rate is shown by the egistrar-Generals Report to be 0 2:? per 1,000. On e figures of H.M. Medical Inspector of Factories the
death-rates for the ten years 1900-1909 work out at about 0*195 per 1,000. Even assuming that these figurej :i show the true position they do not indicate that lead poisoning among painters is more than an ordinary trade risk. Mr. J. H. Schooling states that this is &apos; much smaller than the special death risks that attach to various other occupations, and is relatively trivia1.&quot; See App. I, p. iv. The true figure is, indeed, probably very much less, for the reasons already mentioned.Sickness Statistics. As regards lead sickness among painters, in the absence of any compulsory notification, there is no material for forming the most general estimate; there is, in particular, no information as to length of sickness nor as to age distribution upon whicli f to base any reliable calculation. The only general legitimate inference is that since the death rates among painters are at least not in excess of the normal, the sickness rates are likewise not in excess. (See Ap-appendix I, p. vii.)It is to be observed that the Majority Report of the Departmental Committee on the use of lead in painting (Cd. 7882) was obliged to admit that &quot; the rates of deaths and attacks due to lead poisoning among house painten are thus comparatively small.&quot;  (p. 79.)The medical, chemical and technical evidence support- I ing the general statement in the heading to p. 10, will ( be found in the following pages.
ll-lhe Prohibition of the use of White Lead infPainting would be enormously costly to the community and would have disastrous effects upon Home and Imperial Industries: it would be difficult to enforce and would be of doubtful effectts!U    Prohibition would increase the cost of painting to the community because there is no generally efficient substitute for White Lead and the use of other pigments would not only cost more but would fail to give the same protection to exposed surfaces, etc.; prohibition voulcl of necessity extinguish the White Lead industry nd would also bring to an end the British lead mining industry, both results directly increasing the burden of memployment; as Home and Imperial industrial in-erests are bound up with Lead from the mine to the maintenance-pot, prohibition would have a much wider and ven more disastrous indirect effect.n,4cli h(.phenThere are no Effective Substitutes for Wthite Lead.The best practical proof of the superiority of White iead to other paints is the fact that, at any rate within j/yie British Empire, the master painter prefers to use IHiite Lead.    After all the master painter must be edited with knowing his business ; it is to his interest ) turn out good work, and if the substitutes for White eacl had in fact all the advantages claimed for them wt\7 advertisement and in the pages of the Memorandum the International Labour Office they would have long ;o superseded White Lead upon their own merits,, Another illustration of the superiority of White Lead the fact that the many hundreds of patents for white ints nearly all take White Lead as the ideal and are vertised as being equal to White Lead. That there is no effective substitute for White sad   indeed   requires less  demonstration  at thiswil!
time than ever, as it is well-known that buildings which during the War were painted with substitutes, owiim to the shortage of White Lead, are now in a deplorablF condition because the substitutes have failed to protect, and have indeed left the surface in such a condition that it is difficult to put on a new protective covering of paint.The technical reasons why White Lead has no effective substitute and is superior to so-called sub-stitutes in Durability and Hiding power and therefore in Economy are shown in Appendix III. (p. xviii), together with a frank statement of certain defects of While Lead. It may be said here that it is no part of the case of the manufacturers ol White Lead to deny all merit to Zinc Oxide and to other substitutes, for which in certain circumstances, and especially for interior use, there are certain advantages. It is known that the low protective quality of Zinc Oxide and other substitutes can be counteracted by the use of expensive varnishes, This is a costly method which may commend itself to millionaire yacht-owners, but in spite of the question-begging state-ment of Dr, Teleky that &quot; one coat of varnish is better than many cases of lead poisoning,&quot; it is a method which is impossible for general painting practice the Cost to the Community oe Substitutes.If a moments thought be given to the number of structures, machines, and implements which require to be painted, if only for the purpose of protection, it will be realised how large an item of public and private expenditure comes under the heading of &quot;Painting,&quot; and how important a consideration is the comparative cost of the use of pigments. The following are some of the facts. which cause the use of Zinc Oxide and leadless paints to be relatively far more costly than that of White Lead, it being always borne in mind that labour is by far the heaviest item in the cost of painting, representing something like four-fifths of the total cost: (1) Their inferior &quot; hiding &quot; power necessitates
i larger number of coats and the labour is proportionately Bncreased; (2) the larger number of coats necessary Hvolves also the use of a larger quantity of paint 3) their lesser durability necessitates more frequent epainting; (4) repainting is more difficult on surfaces previously painted with substitutes; (5) nothing works hjo easily under the brush as White Lead.The position may be fairly summarised by saying that, the use of White Lead were prohibited, the annual expenditure of the community upon painting would be reatly increased. The only seriously suggested sub-itutes are Zinc products: as such products are Jractically foreign monopolies it is not possible to ptimate the prices to which they would rise if the use 10 White Lead were prohibited.It is scarcely necessary to emphasise the importance f these facts as affecting the cost of building and the yu laintenance of existing buildings.   The question has to (e considered from the point of view of national economy id is one in which the public is directly concerned.liLrflbe1 .coiird onukoProhibition would have a disastrous effect on Home and Imperial Industries.1. The White Lead Industry.---It is clear that the mediate effect of Prohibition, if it could be enforced, ould be to extinguish the manufacture of White Lead Great Britain. The great bulk of White Lead (it is estimated 85 per cent.) is used for paint; the other uses White Lead, ie., for glazing in the Potteries, pipe nting,. etc., require comparatively small quantities. In the event of an international prohibition there ; mid, of course, be no outlet by export; nor would the isence of 4 per cent, or 5 per cent, of lead in the imbous Zinc White advocated by the Memorandum of ) International Labour Office materially affect the dtion. It is equally clear that it would not be impossible to adapt White Lead factories to the manufac-,e of Zinc Oxide and other substitutes. Prohibition would therefore, if it could be enforced,Ih3.0tort eh30S tUate
bring to an end this industry, and the whole of the I workers engaged in this industry would also inevitabkl be thrown out of employment. NThe White Lead manufacturers are large users of certain necessities for the process of the manufacture of White Lead, such as earthenware pots, Timber, Spent Tan and acetic acid, and the cessation of their demand for these would affect employment in these industries.2. Imperial Lead Mines. The world&apos;s annual pro-duction of metallic lead is about 1,100,000 tons, of which 210,000 to 220,000 tons or 20 per cent, are used for conversion into White Lead.   The great bulk of the White Lead (say 85 per cent.) is used for painting.  As Zinc Oxide is not equal in durability or hiding power to V White Lead, it may be estimated that some 250,000 tons ja of spelter (crude zinc), or its equivalent in ore, would be ffi - required in substitution for the 210,000 tons or 220,001 [j tons of- lead used to make White Lead, if the use ol %\ White Lead were prohibited for painting.Deposits of Zinc blende (ZnS) pure and simple exist )i only in relatively small quantities and in limited areas &amp; and these deposits do not occur in the British Empire Q: By far the greater part of blendes used in the making o fk spelter is produced by working deposits of mixed ores namely silver-bearing   Lead and Zinc ores.   Sue! the deposits exist in many parts of the world and especial!; for in Australia and Burma; the Broken Hill mine ii ie N.S Wales produces 150,000 tons of pig lead and zinfl blendes (representing approximately 100,000 tons Ij spelter) yearly, lead ores being the primary product an I ] zinc ores a bye product. ilnProhibition of the use of White Lead in paintin; r)a reducing the demand for lead by nearly 20 per cent m would inevitably cause a great fall in the price of lea: Sc and, it is stated, would have the effect of closing doi? an not only the Broken Hill mines, but also most mint working similar mixed ores. This again would affect tl w supplies of raw material for the production of spelt ^ and would set up this economic position : a reduction y
he worlds supply of zinc blende, coinciding with an creased demand for a zinc product owing to the splacement of White Lead for painting by Zinc Oxide. Belgium, Germany and the United States have 1 pecialised in the production of spelter and the manu-t future of Zinc compounds and generally in the Zinc n&apos; idustry, whereas the United Kingdom and the British frnpire have specialised in Lead and its products, and here is no indication of the Zinc industry being success-j- iilly established in the United Kingdom. ;li De-silverising of silver lead, smelting of lead and silver 31 res, and consequent refining of silver bullion, which if re all intimately connected with the production of %\ Hiite Lead, would be vitally affected by the prohibition t( f the use of White Lead in painting, and the lead works hi nd mines in the United Kingdom and the British to empire, in which many millions of pounds are invested 0( nd many workers engaged, would be in grave danger o &quot;closing down.If it be considered that the Zinc industry never has j$ ospered in the United Kingdom and British Empire its id that the majority of the spelter works and Zinc m xide works in the United Kingdom are at present o osed down, while Belgium and Gerniany continue res work their factories and smelters and are supplying nc e British market, then the ruinous consequence can be ail reseen of putting the British paint industry at the prey of foreign producers of Zinc.The British production of Zinc Oxide and Lithopone an practically negligible, and Great Britain is dependent nost wholly on. foreign sources for the supply of these tin iterials, because they are more readily and cheaply en iducecl in countries where zinc smelting is carried on ea&apos; cessfully and where, owing to local conditions, they PJ i be produced of high grade at a reasonable cost 1111 The successful manufacture of Lithopone requires fc $ ly years of experience. It was invented by an ^liishman, but, like aniline dyes, its subsequent onlelopment on an industrial and scientific basis has
been largely in the hands of foreigners who have brought the process of manufacture to such a degree of perfection as will effectively prevent serious Englisl competition for many years.Both Lithopone and Zinc Oxide of European manu-facture have been in the past controlled by foreign combinations, such control being, as is usual in such cases, extremely efficient, so that, if the use of White Lead in painting be prohibited, Great Britain will be dependent almost solely on foreign manufactures.It is not inappropriate to quote the words of tlie Geneva Commission: &quot; We do not desire, by yielding to the quite natural &quot;sentiments of those who are concerned for the workers &quot;and demand prohibition, unnecessarily to do the &quot; business of certain financial and commercial mono &quot;monopolies and of certain-manufacturers of Zinc ivho an &quot; and who will be the masters of the price of it&quot; (pp. 04 and 69.)The Machinery of Prohibition.It is clear that, if the use of White Lead in painting be prohibited, it can only be enforced by some system ol inspection and, whatever objections there may be to the policy of Regulations on the ground of difficulty and expense of inspection, they apply with equal force inspection for the purpose of enforcing Prohibition This point was dealt with in the Report of the Genevfl Commission as follows : -&quot; It is said that Regulations would necessitate &quot; policeman for every job  or  for  every  workei &quot; Would it not be necessary to have far more police) &quot;men  and  inspectors,  chemists  and  experts,   m &quot;ascertain what there is in the paint pots containr &quot; ing countless mixtures of innumerable products of zin &quot; mixed with lead ?   Is every coloured pigment con &quot; taming any proportion of lead to be prohibited ? ,1 &quot; so the law would be made of no effect, as will it &quot; inevitably be the case in France.&quot; (&quot;La Ceruse, p. 74.)mlwill
iti btInra er th^nodf ,6 in this connection it may be pointed out that prohibition-llfritiuii would give a far stronger incentive to a breach of !&quot;iie law, because for a good result it is cheaper to use white lead than substitutes; and evasions are difficult to detect. It is a simple matter to cover up an under-?1]soat of white lead with another coat of zinc oxide, etc., p^tnd such a surreptitious use would be far more dangerous ,f han the known and regulated use. -Again, there is not he same chance of master painters and workmen )o-operating in the observance of Prohibition, as the endency of Prohibition is to provoke opposition while Regulations ultimately appeal to the good sense of those ioncerned.It must be borne in mind that, whatever measure of rohibition may be established, there would still be ad poisoning among house painters, because for a considerable period, probably at least ten years, house ainters would continue to dry rub down old paint in rder to prepare the surface for new paint. The danger om lead dust so caused would therefore remain, unless lore were prohibition of the process of dry rubbing own. Such a regulation would require a system of ((spection for its enforcement.It has already been pointed out that one of the eatest dangers arises from the use of turpentine; there e dangers of poisoning from the use of zinc white tip id other substitutes; indeed, the present tendency of neledical opinion is to regard all dust of compounds of avy metals as dangerous. It is clear that the Pro-prohibition of the use of &quot;White Lead only will leave the ^inters subject to many risks, especially that arising ^1(im metallic dust, which would be avoided by a proper leme of Regulations.italy  fzico;tin nal,erusi
lll.-The risk of poisoning in Painting can be effectively dealt with by simple Regulations to avoid the dangers of dust and the vapour of turpentine, etc., and to ensure cleanliness. &apos;If real improvement is to be effected in the health of the painter, all the conditions of his occupation must be reviewed and the problem of poisoning among painters If must be considered as a whole.   The effect of recent 11 investigations is to show that poisoning among painters H must be regarded as paint-poisoning, not as lead-poisoning.First, the danger of poisoning arises from the use of all paints having for base a compound of heavy metal, whether that base be White Lead, or Zinc White or any other.Secondly, it is now seen that a large part of the poisoning is due to the use of volatile thinners, such as Turpentine, or its substitutes such as benzene (see Appendix II, p. xii). If the use of White Lead were prohibited, the painter would still be exposed to this source of poisoning.The Main Source of Metallic Poisoning is Dust, If the question be looked at in relation to the danger arising from the use of lead only, then it is clear that, notwithstanding the statements in the Memorandum of the International Labour Office, the main source of metallic poisoning is the inhalation of dust (see Appendix II., p. xv).   It will suffice to quote Dr. T. M. Leggd (H.M. Medical Inspector of Factories and the Chairman of the Committee on Unhealthy Processes at the Washington International Labour Conference).  In his Report lor 1918, summarising the experience of the years of the War, he says: &quot;On the practical side little more is &quot; to be learned as to how lead poisoning is caused, and?&apos;/ &quot; can be taken as axiomatic that all risk lies in inhalation &quot; of dust or fume. These removed or prevented, there tvoutt &quot; be no lead poisoning&quot; (Annual Report of the Chief Inspector of Factories and Workshops for 1918, Cmd 346, p. 06.)  This view is confirmed by the remarkable
S.of be irsid&apos;al he r tin l a (si vei thJigei; decrease in cases of lead poisoning in White Lead JLjactories, which, after the introduction of Regulations to fftrevent the inhalation of lead dust, fell from 399 in 1899 to 10 in 1919 (see Appendix L, p. ix).Now, if the operations of the painter be considered, it will be seen that those which are most productive of dust are the processes of dry. rubbing down and dry scraping of old paint, It is comparatively simple to avoid the danger of dust by moistening the surface before )rgjrubbing down. The Regulations established as a result of most of the recent Commissions of Enquiry have therefore prohibited the processes of dry rubbing down and dry scraping. Amongst the latest and most thorough studies of this phase of the question is &quot; The Hygiene of the Painter&apos;s Trade &quot; (Bureau of Labour Statistics No. 120, United States Dep. of Labour, pub. 1913) by Dr. Alice Hamilton, in which she says: &quot; Paint dust is caused &quot; chiefly by rubbing old or new paint with dry sandpaper. &quot;This process is universally recognised as the most &quot;dangerous part of the painter&apos;s trade. It could be &quot;completely done away with by the use of cheap mineral &apos; oil to ivet the sandpaper and catch the dust,&quot; and again : &quot; It is entirely possible to do away with the dust of the &apos; rubbing process by keeping the sandpaper moistened tlri(with one of the cheap mineral or hydro-carbon oils, im r choosing one of course that has a Ioav flash-point and ce r that is neither too slow nor too rapid or dries. The 3ndr sandpaper lasts as well with as without the oil and the jeg&apos; result upon the paint is fully as good.&quot;[*m        The Danger of Turpentine Yapours.[n Attention has only recently been drawn to the danger . ye)f the vapour of the volatile thinners (Turpentine or its nor ubstitutes, such as benzene) which are used for nearly anuh1 paints, whether White Lead or zinc white. Turpen-0foj!ine and its substitutes are definite poisons, and as ?w )ainters usually stand within 18 inches of the surface 5 Qrhich they are painting they must be continually ^Cfreathing these vapours. Experiments have proved irkfjhat animals, after breathing turpentine vapour, show
symptoms like those found in the painter; as ^hesej symptoms do not occur in workers in White Lea1 factories (who are, of course, exposed to lead, i.e., lea dust, and not to turpentine), it is concluded that these symptoms are produced by the vapours of turpen-p tine, etc.   These discoveries explain the differences! which have been noticed between painters&apos; sickness&apos; and the sickness of workers in White Lead factories; that is to say, they explain why painters suffer from gout, but White Lead workers do not; why bright&apos;s disease and other kidney troubles are common among painters, but not among White Lead Workers.   These investigations; also upset the notion that painters are specially addicted to alcohol, the fact being that Turpentine has the, properties of an intoxicant and that prolonged exposure to it produces symptoms similar to those of alcoholism (see Appendix II., p. xii.),As Turpentine and other volatile thinners are used I for nearly all paints this danger would obviously not be 1 removed by prohibiting the use of White Lead, and caul only be dealt with by Regulations to secure ventilation IGovernmental Investigations in European countries the subject of lead poisoning has been recently investigated by Commissions of Enquiry in a number of European countries Austria, Belgium, France, Geneva! (State), Germany, Great Britain, Switzerland. With the j exception of France and Great Britain (for reasons and in circumstances already noted and to be noted), all adopted the policy of Regulations, and in particular Regulations in respect of lead dust (see Appendix IV., p. xxix).Of these investigations that of Geneva was perhaps the most illuminating, and its general conclusions may be usefully quoted :-1. &quot; White Lead as used for painting in Geneva &quot; does not constitute a social danger necessitating a 1 &quot; measure so extreme as prohibition.2. &quot; White Lead is a necessity for which Zinc &quot; Oxide is not an all-round substitute.
nNature of Regulations for Pals ting.(a) Regulations to avoid dust. As already shewn, there is a consensus of better informed opinion that Regulations must primarily be directed to the danger of dust, and in particular to the specially dust-producing processes of dry rubbing down and dry scraping, which should be prohibited. 1 (b) Regulations to ensure cleanliness. Next to dust, the chief source of danger of metallic poisoning among house painters arises from paint on unwashed hands and face, which may be conveyed into the mouth, especially in the handling of food or tobacco. This danger can be met by provision of the means of cleanliness and enforce-Iment of their use. These means are indicated by the foreign regulations and may be summarised as follows: 1. Provision of washing appliances, Water, towels, soap. The provision of water is specially important in the case of work on a new building . where there is no water supply.hi . iiLet mlaj3VflIW* This has long been the practice in Great Britain, and is coming into general use in other countries.3. &quot; Painting with White Lead is not a real &apos; danger when simple precautions are taken.4. &quot; Lead dust may be avoided by the use of &quot; White Lead in the form of paste, i.e. ground in &quot; oil,* and by preventing dry rubbing down and &quot; dry pumice stoning and burning off of old paint.&quot; !j:    (&quot;La Ceruse,&quot; pp. 17-19.)A Results of Regulations Where Tried. ^ Owing to the comparatively recent introduction of ^ Regulations and to the intervention of the War there are Qg few statistics to shew the effect of Regulations. Such ^ as exist shew a diminution of cases of lead sickness (see g I Appendix IV.).--. In particular the statistics of the German sick benefit societies (Krankenkassen) do not support the conclusions drawn therefrom by the Memorandum of the Inter-national Labour Office.
2. Use of overalls and the washing of ihem.  The reasonably frequent washing of overalls prevent,^ the danger of dust from the drying of paint splashec on them.3. Ventilation, This is of great importance for inside painting, particularly with reference to tur-pentine and its substitutes.(c) General Regulations.1. Periodical medical inspection is of special importance because paint poisoning is slow and cumulative in its effects. It would in particular enable those specially susceptible to be debarred from continuance in this occupation.2. Printed advice explaining the dangers of the industry, with suggestions as to their avoidance, is of importance because the average painter is frequently found to be indifferent to the dangers incidental to his calling.If the health of the workers is really to be protected, Regulations will be necessary whether the use of white lead be prohibited or not, and most, if not all, of the above Regulations should be established.The Master Painters of Great Britain and Ireland have prepared a set of simple Regulations which they consider should be effective : these will be found in Appendix V., p. xxxiv.The Machinery of Regulations. It is not necessary to elaborate any specific scheme for the enforcement of Regulations. The machinery of enforcement is an ordinary administrative matter for each country concerned, and does not present any exceptional difficulties.It is said that Regulations would be difficult to enforce because the painting industry is one in which men are engaged on many separate jobs for short periods and often in quite small numbers. It is admitted that it I is not so easy to enforce regulations in such cases as in a factory industry where many men are concentrated in one building, but effective enforcement is neverthelesI-&apos;
21Qm x ulie ofto3d ite ill elitiej iiilo1Ciiia; t.i lie oc it i in Ilequite practicable. It would be - quite unnecessary that every job should be inspected; surprise visits and the rigid infliction of penalties would soon have the desired result. Regulations for the purity of milk are more difficult to enforce than regulations for painting, although of more vital importance, yet a fairly high standard is maintained without daily visits. The observance of a law does not depend on any certainty that a breach will be detected, but upon the knowledge that if discovered it will be punished. No law giver can expect that his law will never be broken, he can only make it worth while not to break it.It is submitted that, from this point of view, the calculations put forward by the British Departmental Committees on the use of lead in painting, as to the pro-hibitive expense of inspection, are wholly fallacious and extravagant. This Report itself suggests Regulations (for the enforcement of which inspection would be necessary) to deal with the &quot;possible dangers to health arising from the vapours of the media used equally in all paints,&quot; e.g., turpentine and turpentine substitutes (Cmd. 7882, p. 103).It may be remarked that inspection of the conditions of work of women and painters&apos; apprentices will be necessary for the enforcement of the &quot;Women and Young-Persons (Employment in Lead Processes) Act, 1920, as to the provision of means of avoiding lead-dust, special clothing, medical inspection, etc. (which Act was passed by the British Parliament in pursuance of the Reconi-mendation of the Washington International Labour Conference), and there can be no more difficulty in the inspection of the conditions of work of adult male workers.The publication of Regulations would, of itself, have a beneficial effect. Anyone who has made inquiry of painters will usually find that they have no personal knowledge of cases of lead poisoning and that they are somewhat sceptical about it.In this connection it is also suggested that the operative Painters Trades Unions might usefully co-operate in seeing that Regulations are enforced, e.g., by officially giving information of breaches.
CONCLUSIONS. jThe foregoing facts and arguments point with irre-sistible cumulative effect to a policy of simple Regula-tions as the effective method of dealing with the danger of paint poisoning. Reduced to its simplest terms, the problem is. to avoid the inhalation of metallic dust and of turpentine vapour. As to dust, this problem has been solved by Regulations in the manufacture of White Lead, which necessitates far more dust than is caused in painting.Paint and the labour of painting are, in a climate such as that of the United Kingdom, a very large factor in the maintenance of every dwelling and public building. The increased cost which would be caused by Prohibition would inevitably fall, not on the paint merchant or upon the master painter, but upon the consumer, and it is not too much to say that it would directly or indirectly affect every citizen.It is not, however, contended that the argument from cost is by itself final. It may be right that the use of a particular article should be suppressed, even if the cost of living of every citizen and the annual expenditure of public bodies and the State be very heavily increased, and even if it involve the destruction of industries, such as the manufacture of White Lead and of Lead-mining, and the throwing out. of employment of large numbers of men. It will, however, be generally agreed that the conditions which justify such a step must include the following : (1) The danger must be proved and great; (2) It must be reasonably certain that Prohibition would effect its object; (3) There must be no other available method of avoiding the danger. It has already been shown that not one of these conditions is fulfilled.It must be realised that, in the machinery of our present civilization, trade risks are incidental to most, if not all, occupations and that there are many occupations where the risk is greater. It is a proper function of the State to regulate all dangerous trades, but, in the words
of the Report of the Belgian Senate, &quot; The Legislature ^shomd not use the weapon of prohibition except with the ffttmost reserve&quot;The general conclusion of the Geneva Commission may be usefully quoted : &quot; The danger is not sufficient &quot; to necessitate the prohibition of a material the careful &quot;use of which does not constitute a social peril.   There &quot; is an industrial risk and we do not suppose that it can &quot;ever be abolished in painting any more than in any &quot; other occupation.   At the forge, the slate-quarry, the &apos; loom, as a file-worker or a dyer, the worker is : exposed to risks often more serious.   We do not desire &quot; by yielding to the quite natural sentiments of those who are concerned for the workers and demand prohibition, unnecessarily to do the business of certain &quot;financial and commercial monopolies and of certain manufacturers of Zinc, who are and who will be the &quot;mashrs of the price of it.&quot;   (&quot;La Ceruse,&quot; pp. 64 and 69).The British Manufacturers of White Lead have given practical expiession to the feelings of humanity which they share with other people by the proper egulation of their own industry, and as a consequence Lead poisoning in their own industry has been almost extinguished. To the manufacturers as practical men, in view of the adoption by foreign countries of Regu-lations for painting and of the success of Regulations, 30th there and in their own industry, it would appear to be the reverse of common sense that the extreme measure of Prohibition with its initial injustice and obvious economic disadvantages and its doubtful effectiveness, should be adopted in this country without even trying the alternative of Regulations.The method of Prohibition is at first sight one of alluring simplicity. To a certain class of mind it would seem well that an article, the unguarded use of which is .f I responsible for a considerable amount of human ? suffering and some deaths in a particular industry, should be suppressed regardless of consequence. This ittitude of the reformer in a hurry is not the attitudens re ds
proper to the legislator and does not beiit an ago of Science.   The method of the science of public hygiene is the patient study of the facts and of the causes o industrial disease with a view to their removal, having regard to all the industrial conditions.   Attention is called to the weighty words of a distinguished hygienist, himself a Medical Inspector of Factories in Bohemia :--&quot; The parts of the industrial structure are so &quot; closely interrelated that it is not easy to measure &quot; what effect any one part will have on the other &quot;parts.   There is a danger that an ill-considered &quot;interference with industry for reasons of hygiene &quot;will defeat its own object and that those very &quot; workers whom it is sought to protect, or perhaps &quot; an equally important or numerous body of workers, &quot;will be deprived of their livelihood.   Prohibition &quot; of the use of a dangerous article is a mode of &quot;dealing with the danger which is in my view &quot;somewhat childish in its simplicity, and would &quot; lead to an almost intolerable interference with the &quot; machinery of civilisation if it were applied to all &quot; the substances which are of greater danger than &quot;White Lead.   Hygiene must not be merely &quot;negative in its action, its method must be to study &quot; all the factors of the industrial situation and to &quot; make a dangerous   industry   non - dangerous &quot; (Pambousek).&quot;
APPENDIX ISTATISTICS oi Lead Poisoning among Painters.The following statements are confined to conditions in Great (Britain.The latest available statistics of the number of painters in Eng-and and Wales are contained in the Census of Occupation for .901 and 1911. In the 1901 figures, painters axe grouped with glaziers. After deducting from, the 1901 figures the same propor-tdom of glaziers as is shown in the 1911 figures, and after deducting 12 per cent, as representing employers, the average number of operative house painters for the years 1901 to 1911 in England and Wales may be reckoned as 150,000. (Report of Dept. Comm. on use of lead in painting, cmd.. 7882, page 77.)There are no reliable statistics as to the incidence! of lead poisoning [amongst British painters, due to the use of lead paints:  (a) Mortality statistics exist, but are admittedly unreliable.(b) Sickness statistics do not exist.A.-MORTALITY STATISTICS OF LEAD POISONING AMONG PAINTERS.(1) UNRELIABILITY.Figures are, of course, available as to the numbers of certificates ascribing lead poisoning as the cause of death of painters, but these are unreliable for the following reasons:  According to recent investigations, many symptoms (such as bright&apos;s disease, gout, anaemia), which were formerly ascribed to lead, are directly attributable to other constituents of paints, and, I in particular, to the effects of Turpentine or its substitutes. Apart rom this special source of error, which, is a matter of comparatively [recent knowledge, the symptoms which are characteristic of lead poisoning are admittedly not specific, and it is recognised that the diagnosis of lead poisoning is a matter of extreme difficulty, and jpne requiring special knowledge. Sir Kenneth Goadby, indeed, who has unrivalled experience, states that it is impossible, without a previous knowledge of the case, to distinguish between deaths due (to chronic rheumatism and to lead poisoning.For this reason it is, in respect of cases of lead sickness in factory industries reported by certifying surgeons, the practice of the British JtLome Office to make a 10 per cent, reduction before officially record-ling them. (N.B.-This reduction is not made in respect of the  returns of cases of lead sickness among painters, which returns are loluntary, not- compulsory.)    As regards deaths, however, the
practice is to record all cases as of lead poisoning, where the death certificate refers to lead poisoning, as the direct or indirect cause of death.   This is a source of serious error.Dr. T. M. Legge (ELM. Med! Inspector of Factories) and Sir Kenneth Goad by, in their book on &quot;Lead Poisoning and Lead Absorption&quot; (pub. Arnold, 1912), state that there is &quot; an increas-ing inclination to attribute chronic nephritis and even (without justification, in our opinion) phthisis and pneumonia to lead podson-ing in the death certificates of lead workers.&quot; There are, according tc Dr. Legge, even cases where diphtheria, rheumatic fever and typhoid fever were the cause of death, but, owing to the inclusion of the words &quot; lead poisoning on the certificate, have been recorded as deaths by lead poisoning. (Evidence Deip. Comm. on use of lead in painting, Cmd. 632, page 10, q. 243, 244.) The mere fact that it has been necessary to appoint a specially qualified medical referee to assist in dealing with cases of lead poisoning in Workmen&apos;s Cbm-pensation Act claims sufficiently emphasises the difficulty of correct diagnosis of lead poisoning.If, however, notwithstanding this known inaccuracy,&quot; the figures of mortality among painters be taken, it will be found that, according to Dr. Legge, over a period of ten years 1900-1909 293 deaths were certified as being due to lead poisoning among painters in England and Wales (Scot-land and Ireland are excluded). This gives a death-rate of 0.195 per 1,000 of occupied painters. (Cmd. 7882, p. 77.) It is sufficient comment to quote the words of the Report of the British Departmental Committee on the use of lead in painting, Cmd. 7882, &quot; the rates- of death and attacks due to lead poisoning among house-painters are thus comparatively small,&quot; p. 79.(2) Rjegistrar-Generai/s Occupational Statistics. Other figures of Death statistics are contained in the Report of the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths, &amp;o, for 1908 (Cd,, 2619) Those deal with an occupational group, No. 64, which comprised &quot;plumbers, painters and glaziers.&quot; There are no means of dis-distinguishing painters from plumbers and glaziers, but painters corn-prise the overwhelming majority.These figures show, according to the well-known Insurance statis-tician, Mr. John Holt Schooling, that:  &quot; The mortality in occupational group 64, plumber, painter, &quot; glazier is in no way excessive or abnormal; it has been decreas-&quot; ing as rapidly or more rapidly than the mortality of England m-&quot;&quot;and Wales, and there is a very large number of most varied^) &quot; occupations, many of which are believed to be ordinarily &quot; healthy, in which the mortality exceeds the mortality of groupUpon a comparison of the mortality in the different occupation1! in seven age periods (instead of the Registrar-General&apos;? method of

id) The mean annual death-rate from lead poisoning in the Painters&apos; group is only 0.23 deaths per 1,000 at all ages, and Mr. Schooling states that this rate is &quot;much smaller than thei special death risks that attach to various other occupations, ana^ is relatively trivial,&quot; and that the proportion of lead poisoning is small among the total causes of death.   The figures for the] age periods are:  _    _(From Cd. 2,619. page 10(1.) _Ages.15-19 20-24 25-34 35-44 45-54 55-6465 and olderAll AgesMean Annual Death Rates per 1,000 Living Painters.

If this comparison, with other occupations be extended for the Idifferent age-periods, it is seen that there are at all age-periods many jfllccupations which are not considered to be exposed to any undue &quot;Trisk, in respect olf which the death-rates are the same as for painters (or are even higher.For the purpose of the calculation, the range of death-rates of the 133 occupations for each age-period has been divided into 25 groups at equal intervals. The range of death-rate necessarily widens at each age-division as is shown in the following table, which shows the painters&apos; death-rate, and enables a comparison of it with the naximum for each age-period.Age group	Maximum Death-rate.

At age 20-25 the following occupations sihow death-rates proximately equal to that of the painters: 1Law cleric, railway engine-driver and stoker, innkeeper (industrial districts), watch, clock and scientific instrument maker, watch and clock maker, baker and confectioner, tailor, boiler-maker, cutler and scissors-maker, coal-miner (Derbyshire and Nottingham), platelayer, &apos;hese are all occupations which no one would regard in any other it than being particularly free from risk.n the group at this stage, showing a higher death-rate than the [liters, are found:  Schoolmaster, shopkeeper, tallow manufacturer, paper manufacturer, etc., etc.i.) Age 25-SJf.   In this division there is a sensible lengthening he range oif death-rates, consequently the intervals of the groups e been increased, but so as still to divide the range approximately 25 intervals as before.he painter is again found in company with:  1 Law clerk, lithographer, copper and steel-plate printer, tailor, currier, etc., boiler-maker, metal workers&apos; group, fish-monger, ironmonger, shopkeeper, watch and clock maker, laker and confectioner, wheelwright, wool and worsted mami-facturer (West Biding), cotton manufacturer and rctton manu* .
facturer (Lancashire), hosiery manufacturer, textile manufac-turers generally, ironstone miner. And the painter is found at this agei-period to be in a better posiA tion than the non-hazardous occupations of:  &apos;Domestic indoor servant (male), or commercial clerk (In-suronce- Service), or a bookbinder, or a butcher, or textile dyer, etc., etc.(iii.) Age $5-J/Jf. At this agie the painter&apos;s occupation shows a slightly higher mortality than the mean annual death-rate for Ocou-pied Males (England and Wales) it is 11.56, as compared witl 10.22. But the maximum death-rates for other occupations at this age-division is as high as 31.75 per 1,000. At this age the painter is grouped with: Gunsmith, fisherman, hatter,  hairdresser, paperhangtt, plasterer and whitewasher, wood-turner, cooper, and the brush and broom-maker. Again, the painters death-rate is also for this age better than for the:  Butcher, nail, anchor and chain and other steel and iron manufacturer, musician or music master, coach, cab and omi-bus service, groom, furrier and skinner, copper manufacturer, or zinc manufacturer, worker, etc.(iv.) At Age  5-55, the painter&apos;s rate is 21.34, as compared witl 17.72 for Occupied Males, England and Wales. Here again tie extreme range should be noted as the maximum rate is 50.16, The 17-18.99 per 1,000 division takes the largest number of the occupations in this age-group. The group in this class includes all occupations where, the death-rate is between 21 and 21.99 per 1,000, and comprises:  Physician, surgeon and general practitioner, transport set-vice (occupations 11, 12, 14 and 19), lead manufacturer ad leaden goods maker, slater and tiler, chemical manufacture!, coalheaver and capper manufacturer, worker, coppersmith, The painters&apos; death-rate is better than: &apos;Musician and music master, nail, anchor and chain nutn faciurers, and brush and broom makers. (v.) Age 55-56.   Though slightly higher for painters, the dealt rate at this age is 35.73, as against 31.01 Occupied Males, England and Wales.   But the range is a large one, rising to&apos; as high as 70 pH 1,000.The painter is grouped with:  Musician, music master, carman, currier, messen$th porter (not railway or Government), transport senitt generally, hatter, hairdresser, copper, tin, zinc workers, viS workers generally, wool worsted manufacturer (West Ridinj\ silk, satin, crape, etc., manufacturer, carpet, rug, felt v0f-facturer, hosiery manufacturer (Leicestershire, NottingUty shire), coalminer, leadminer.
At this age the death-rate of the painter is better than far:  Bargeman, dock labourer, hotel servant, butcher, engine, machine and boiler-maker, copper-worker, coppersmith, wool manufacturer, textile manufacturer generally.(vi.) Age 65 and upwards.The painter is here found grouped with:  Clergyman, artist, engraver, sculptor arid architect, rail-way guard, etc., farmer, et,c, agriculturist, innkeepers&apos; servant in agricultural districts, coal-merchant, coke-burner, stationer, publisher and newsagent, pi&apos;inter, zinc manufacturer [worker), carpenter and&apos; joiner, cabinet-maker, etc., building trades gener-ally, shipbuilding, coalheaver and chimney-sweep, and Civil Service (officer and clerk).It is unnecessary at this age division toi show other less favourableipations, as it is plain that the painter is in a group where long is usually found. B.-SICKNEBS STATISTICS OF LEAD POISONING AMONG PAINTERS, here are no reliable statistics of sickness among painters due to poisoning. The only figures of any kind are those contained in Annual Reports of the Chief Inspector of Factories and Work-)s. These are admittedly incomplete, not to say valueless, so as concerns house-painters, because house painting is not a fac-&apos; occupation, and is therefore not subject to the compulsory noti-ion of casesi of lead poisoning under the Factory and Workshops , 1901, Section 73. A number of cases are, however, voluntarily jirted each year by medical officers, and are recorded in the Chief sector&apos;s Reports; but, as notification is not compulsory, the num-i so reported from year to year have no relation to the true num-! of cases of sickness, here has been pointed out elsewhere the unreliability of all res in regard to lead poisoning, owing to the admitted difficulty bs diagnosis and the tendency to ascribe to lead poisoning symp-s which are properly attributable; to other causes. In particular, erence has been made to recent investigations showing that soning among painters must be regarded as &quot; paint poisoning,&quot; chief cause of poisoning being turpentine and turpentine substi-wihich, as volatile thinners, are constituents cf most painta. ether with a lead base or not (fee pp. i. and xii.). ilr. J. H. Schooling gives the following reasons why the data in pect of sickness among painters are &quot; wholly inadequate &quot; :  &quot; Not only is there no age distribution, but also there is &quot; no statement even of the number of men exposed to risk of &quot; sickness, nor is there any information as to the duration of &quot; the attack of sickness; also there is no information as to the &quot; sickness from causes other than lead poisoning accruing &quot; among these men who experienced some sickness from lead &quot; poisoning.   .   .   .j dei 3ng s 70&apos;essen se\rs,Bidlilt ii Ming.
&quot; In actuarial investigations it sometimes happens that a &quot; part of the data desired cannot be obtained, but if the main I &quot; portion of the essential data be available, it then sometim^LP &quot; becomes possible to make&apos; certain assumptions as to the naturWj &quot; of the missing data which do not greatly detract from, the &quot; validity of the results brought out by such investigation. &quot; But in this instance not one of the essential sets of data is &quot; known.&quot; No opinion cf any validity can possibly be formed by &quot; means of these data . . which relate to the question &quot; whether or not the rates of sickness among house-painters, &quot; etc., fall short of, or exceed, the rates of sickness in all oocu-&quot; pations combined. The duration of an attack of sickness is &quot; an essential feature of any investigation of sickness rate. &quot; Deration of sickness is more important than the number of &quot; cases of sickness, because duration of sickness is more pro-&quot;minently a function of age than is the number of cases of &quot; sickness.&quot;The only valuable broad inference to be drawn from the figures as to lead sickness is that, since the death rates among, house painters are, as has been shown, at least not in excess of the normal, there is a presumption that the sickness rates of house painters are like-wise not in excess.   Mr. John Holt Schooling puts it thus:  &quot; Although sickness does not follow the fluctuations of &quot; mortality, yet there is a connection between the two things, &quot; both of them, being essentially functions of age.   That is to &quot; say, both sickness and death are largely influenced by the ago &quot; of a life exposed to the risk of sickness or of death.   Thus, if &quot; we find that in any occupation the death-rates from all causes &quot; are not in excess of normal death rates, there is at the least a *&apos; fair presumption that the sickness rates from all causes are &apos; not in excess of normal sickness rates.   This may be applied &apos;&apos; to the occupation, &apos; plumber, painter, glazier.&apos;   This occu &apos; pation has a low death-rate as regards several potent causes &quot; of death, and presumably, therefore, this occupation escapes &quot; the sickness, that comes before death from such diseases.&quot; It has already been pointed out that the Report of the Depart-mental Commission on the use of lead compounds in painting, in spite of its obvious tendency to empihasisei all the evidence in favour of prohibition, is forced to admit that &quot; the rates of death ad attacks due to lead poisoning among house-painters are compara-tively small.&quot;C-STATISTICS OF LEAD POISONING IN FACTORYOCCUPATIONS.It is convenient to set out here the figures of lead poisoning for the years 1900 to 1919 contained in the Annual Report of the Chief Inspector of Factories for 1919 (Chid. 941). These relate to tie factory occupations which come under the Factory Acts and are the subject of Home Office Regulations.I

Fatal cases not reported in previous years are included as both cases and deaths.t The figure for 1899 was 399.
The outstanding feature of this table is the marked general diminution of lead poisoning. In particular, there is a very marked diminution of the cases in the Potteries and in the lead factories. In the Potteries (Item No. 10, &quot;China and Earthen-ware &quot;) the figures fell from 200 in 1900 to 21 in 1919. In the white lead factories the figures fell from 399 in 1899 to 10 in 1919. This reduction is undoubtedly due to the institution and enforcement of Regulations by the Home Office. Dr. Legge,.H.M. Medical Inspector of Factories, has said:  &quot; The striking decrease in lead poisoning had been due to &quot; the willing co-operation of the manufacturers in carrying out &quot; the Home Office Regulations, the chief means having been &quot; the effective institution of exhaust appliances for the removal j &quot; of dust, and the periodical medical inspection, which was &quot; us&apos;ful not onlv or the netuction of the oncoming disease, but &quot; also in putting right any particular process which was the &quot; cause of lead poisoning.&quot; (&quot; Oil and Colour Trades Journal,&quot; p. 2271, 28th June, 1913.)Statements of Dr. Legge emphasising the supreme importance of lead dust as the &quot; sole causative agent &quot; of lead poisoning will be found on page xvi.D. SUMMARY.There are no reliable statistics in respect of either mortality or sickness.The mortality figures include many cases which are not lead poisoning: such as they are, they show that the mortality among j painters is in no way abnormal.   In the absence of compulsory notify-cation there is no basis for anything but guesswork in regard to sickness attack rate.It has already been mentioned that the Committee on Unhealthy Processes of the Washington International Labour Conference recom-mended that notification of cases of lead poisoning should be com-puisory in all conntriee. Nothing, so far, has been done to give effect to this recommendation.The method of industrial hygiene must be toi study all the factors of the industrial situation, and the first essential is the collection and interpretation of accurate statistics, without which no action should bet taken.At present reliable statistics do not erxist. In the collection and interpretation of them, care must be taken to differentiate between cases of true lead poisoning and cases of poisoning attributable to causes other than lead.
appendix II. MEDICAL.Physiological and chemical evidence show that industrial sickness amongst house-painters is largely due to causes other than lead, which causes would not be affected by Prohibition.For all practical purposes, paint can be regarded as being com-posed of (1) solid pigment, (2) liquid vehicle or medium, which consists of (a) drying oil, e,g., linseed oil, (b) volatile thinner, e.g., turpentine.The operations of painting which may cause danger of lead poison-ing are as follows:  souecm of dangee.(i) Inhalation of dust of dry pig-mnnt created through handling the pigment.(ii) Splashing of paint on to clothing ---the paint subsequently drying, giving rise to dust.Operation. Grinding or mixing of dry pigment in oil.(This is now not commonly per-ionned. by the painter.)Thinning down of oil paste to suit-able paint consistency.(i) Soiling of hands which if not subsequently washed may con-vey paint to the mouth when eating or smoking.(ii) Splashing as above,Preparation of surface to be painted.(a) Filling in cracks or irregular-larities in surface.[I) Dry rubbing down of old work or intermediate coats prior to the application of fresh paint.Application of paint, i.e., actual brush work.   ,Soiling of hands as above.Inhalation of dust produced in the process of dry rubbing down.(i) Inhalation of vapours of the volatile thinners (which com-mence to be produced iinmedi-ately the paint is applied) and the inhalation of the vapours from the drying of the oil (which are proa uced more slowly).(ii) Splashing as above.From this table the sources of danger may be summarised as:   A. (i.) Vapours of the volatile thinner,   (ii.) Vapours &apos; produced during the drying of oil.B. Paint carried to the mouth through the use of sailed hands in eating, etc.C. Dust created in mixing, dry rubbing down, and froiii the drying of splashes on clothing.
XllThe above sources of danger are common to all paints containing pigments, and the only difference between lead paints and others is the character of the pigment. jA. (i.) Vapours of Volatile Thinners.The thinners in general use are turpentine or its substitutes (which are usually hydrocarbons with low boiling points). These volatile thinners can be considered as a whole, as their physiological effects differ only in degree, and not in character.The dangerous nature of such substances has been known for some long period, and it has been common knowledge that paints containing thinners when used in confined spaces entailed grave risks to the workers, unless there were efficient ventilation so as to prevent the inhalation of these vapours. Attention has only recently been given to the physiological effects produced by constant exposure to such vapours when in a state of dilution similar to that which obtains in the ordinary practice of painting. The results obtained in the investigation of turpentine vapours may be taken as typical.The experiments of Prof. Lehmann* have shown that when animals are subject to air charged with turpentine vapour to the extent of 3 or 4 millegrammes of vapour per litre of air, severe symptoms are induced. The turpentine acts as a local irritant, and, when absorbed in the system, has an exciting effect on the central nervous system. Inhalation of large quantities of turpentine vapour causes rapid breathing, palpitation, giddiness, stupor, convulsions, and other nervous disturbances, pains in the chest, bronchitis, and in-flanimation of the kidneys. The last-named symptom also  arises from the chronic action of turpentine vapours, which is of chief im-portance in this connection.Sir Kenneth Goadby, after a series of experiments designed to ascertain what, if any, ill-affects were produced by the vapours arising from a freshly-painted surface, found that the poisonous effects produced in animals (cats) by exposing them to the vapour given off by painted surfaces are caused by the turpentine content of the paint, and not by the linseed oil, driers or metallic salt of the paint.Further, that turpentine vapour, when inhaled by an animal (cat), produces symptoms in a surprisingly rapid manner, ultimately leading to death if the exposure be long continued, but if exposures to the inhalation of turpentine vapours are given at intervals, the time of exposure being less than that required to produce coma, the animaPs tissues eventually show changes of an inflammatory nature, amongst these being disease of the kidney (tubular nephritis).Animals exposed to a concentration of turpentine vapour in ait equal to that present in the air of an ordinary-sized room in which painting might be carried out, showed that, after the 29th day, after* Beiirage zur Kenntniss der Terpentinolidrhing [Archiv. fiir Hygiene ]899,
xllli\W exposures, totalling %7 hours 15 minutes, the animal died, and, on ^semination, showed haemorrhages in many of the organs, and narked kidney affection.Throe more animals exposed to turpentine alone by-way of control experiments all died after nine exposures, and two died during the te irst exposure. Histological examination showed in all cases inflamatory-2s nation of the kidney and a tendency to capillary haemorrhage, ca These experiments are of special interest in that they indicate he explanation of the differences which have been noted between fohe so-called lead poisoning experienced by painters and that ex-nberienced by White Lead workers:  w (a) Acute kidney symptoms are common amongst painters,1 t while uncommon amongst workers in White Lead factories, and Ql it is, therefore, probable that turpentine is the cause of the afl incidence of Bright&apos;s Disease amongst painters being above the ha     average.lit (b) The prevalence of gout among painters and the absenceke     of this symptom in White Lead workers is, according to SirKenneth Goadby, probably due to the same cause. aa (c) Headache is an early symptom in the so-called leadb o     poisoning amongst painters, but, in cases of lead poisoning by m     inhalation of lead dust, it is a late and grave symptom, he (d) Sir Kenneth Goadby considers that the alteration in&apos;oi the blood produced by turpentine, with the accompanying us* baseophilic staining, explains the chronic anaemia often seen in a11     painters.ii The results of these experiments agree with those of the examina-roiiom of 62 painters of Chicago by Nicholl and others, whose oonclu-in ions were that &quot; turpentine vapour is readily absorbed in toxicmounts into the human system,&quot; and that &quot; its elimination by way d tf the kidneys is a common cause of the great frequency of acute ouund chronic urinary diseases among painters.&quot; (Report of Conimis-noiion on Occupational Diseases. Illinois. 1911.) poi It is clear that the effect of turpentine requires serious consideration-itei ion: it probably explains the symptoms frequently experienced by f tl: persons exposed to fresh paint.    The illness is definite, and notasily confused with lead poisoning by anyone who has had experi-im; nee of lead poisoning, but has possibly been so confused in the past ate! ecause it has been associated with paint.sun The heavy fatality caused in England in the early days of the , tl far by volatile thinners used in dope when applied to varnishing of .. theroplane wings illustrates1 the toxic effects of these substances. It tuns, therefore, a fact of first importance that painters are continually xposed toi the atmosphere of a volatile thinner, whether the base of n a he paint be lead or its substitutes; also that the substitutes for vhicQ&amp;d require a great quantity of thinners; further, that the present-ai/day vogue of flat finishes doubtless contributes largely to sickness 3 jggimongst painters.
(ii.) Vapouks Produced During the Drying oe the Oil Constituent of the Paint.The drying oil dries by oxidation, and not by evaporation, an during the process vapours are evolved.These vapours have been investigated by many workers, in pai ticular by certain French investigators, M. Breton, Dr. Marie, Di Heim, M. Hebert, who have at various times published the results of their investigations, purporting to show that in the drying o white lead paint a small but appreciable amount of lead is vola tilised, and that, in consequence, painters are exposed to a serious source of lead poisoning.In 1911, Prof. E. C. C. Baly, of the Liverpool University, claimed to have confirmed these observations. The matter was, therefore referred to Prof. H. E. Armstrong, F.R.S., Sir Kenneth Goadby and Mr. C. A. Klein, who carried out exhaustive experiments, and demonstrated positively that there was no scientific foundation foj the results of either the French observers or Prof. Baly. Prof Baly subsequently repeated his work, and stated before the Home Office Departmental Committee on the&apos; use of lead in painting that he could not confirm his earlier results, and the whole matter was referred to Sir J. J. Dabble, then principal Government chemist, who stated in his report that the results of hie investigations coo-firmed the results of Goadby, Armstrong and Klein, and. that he had been unable toi confirm certain experiments of Dr. Heim and Dr, Hebert with reference to the volatility of metallic lead or white lead, The Report of the Departmental Committee in dealing with this question states that:&quot; from all fresh paint fumes are constantly given off, and have in the past been held by eminent experts to contain the elements of lead poisoning.&quot;&quot; The Committee have therefore given the matter careful &quot; consideration, but, guided by the results of experiments &quot; carried on by Dr. Dobbie, the Principal Chemist of the Gov-&quot; eminent Laboratory, and the statements of other distinguished &quot; scientists, namely, Mr. K. W. Goadby, Prof. H. E. Arm-&quot; strong, and Mr. C. A. Klein, as well as Prof. E. C. C. &quot; Baly, in his later evidence, they have formed the opinion that &quot; fumes may be justifiably disregarded as in any way a source &quot; of lead poisoning &quot; (pp. 84, 85).It is known that certain vapours are evolved during the drying of a painted surface owing to the oxidation of the drying oil, and that these vapours possess a nauseous odour and in certain cireum-stances cannot be regarded as being wholesome&apos;. As already indi-cated, such vapours are coanmon to all paints which contain a drying oil, irrespective of the nature of the base used. Prof. Baly claimed to have shown that in the case of white lead a great quantity of vapour was produced, and&apos; that such vaponrs contained aldehydes, which he regarded as being toxic in character.   Sir J. J. Dobbie, in
his report to the Departmental Committee, showed that the total juantity of aldehyde given off is practically identical for all pig-nents, while) the rate at which it is given off appears to be a func-aon of the rate of drying. As in practice paints are required to dry in approximately the same time, the matter cannot be regarded as liaving the slightest importance.   The giving off of such vapours by Ithe pigments alone has only academic interest.   If a paint is to dry fthesei vapours: will arise, and iSir Kenneth Goadby, in his evidence Before the Departmental Committee, reported experiments in which lie had submitted oats for a considerable period of time to the lyapoiurs arising from mixtures of the pigment and linseed oil (tur-Ipentine being omitted so as to avoid its known poisonous effects); in Ino case was any symptom, of poisoning observed.   Sir Kenneth jGoadby also reported upon and extended experiments described by pDr. Marie dealing with the effect of such vapours on the growth of f bacteria, and showed that they were improperly controlled and did not conform to the standard of accuracy requisite in such investiga-Hons.One point of considerable importance has been established by ? these experiments, viz., that, during the drying of oil paint, vapours ; are evolved from the drying oil which have pronounced antiseptic :; properties, and the antiseptic value of painting operations has been definitely shown, and, further, this is not peculiar to white leadpaint.-I B. Paint Carried to the Mouth through the Soiling of Hands.This is obviously a source of danger which can be avoided.   What-\ ever paint is used, proper washing facilities should be provided and ! used.   The leading authorities on lead poisoning do not, however, I regard lead carried to the month as a serious source of poisoning, I and, indeed, medical opinion to-day does not attach major import-:j ance to lead poisoning by the gastric intestinal tract.   After exhaus-\ tive investigations both by experiment and by factory observation, ; Drs. Legge and Goadby, the chief British authorities, express the : ratio of danger by the gastro-intestinal tract, compared with that by the respiratory tract, as 1: 100.   It may be mentioned that it is extremely doubtful whether zinc would be less dangerous than lead in this respect.Experiments made by Sir Kenneth Goadby by the subcutaneous ! inoculation of white lead, lithopone, zinc oxide into cats gave evidence from which he concluded that zinc as well as lead may be absorbed by the body fluids; such, absorption may be followed by interstitial hemorrhage (zinc) or by kidney disease (lithopone).C-Dust.By the consensus of recent authoritative opinion the chief cause of lead poisoning is the inhalation of lead dust.The Report of the Austrian Coimmission on Lead Poisoning, 1908, stated that: &quot; For inside painting [there is] a quite special
process, causing poisoning, which does not occur in outside painting  the dry pumice-stoning and rubbing  ...   of white lead.&quot;Dr. Legge, H.M. Medical Inspector of Factories, in his repot for the year 1918 summarising the experience of the years of thi war, says that &quot; on the practical side little more is to be learned as to how lead poisoning is earned, amd it can be taken as axiomatic that all risk lies in inhalation of dust or fume. These removed or prevented, there would be no lead poisoning.&apos;&quot; (Annual Report of the Chief Inspector of Factories and Workshops for 1918, Cmd. 346, page 66.) And again, in his Report for the year 1919, says: &quot; As right notions of the causation of lead poisoning are of first importance, I emphasise again my belief, after perusal of some 25,000 reports on cases which have occurred in the past, that locally applied exhaust ventilation is the sheet anchor in the protection of the. workers from leady dust and fume, and that these alone are the causative agents.&quot; (Report of Chief Inspector of Factories and Workshops for 1919, Cmd. 941, page 61.)The experience indicated by Dr. Legge confirms the results ob-tained by the experiments detailed by him in &quot;Lead Poison-ing and Lead Absorption &quot; (Legge and Goadby), pub. Arnold, 1912, whioh is the leading authority on the subject, and Drs. Hill and Bullooh, in their preface to that work, state &quot; the authors bring forward convincing evidence, experimental and statistical, in favour of the causation of lead poisoning by the inhalation of dust. This makes prevention a comparatively simple matter, and the methods of prevention are effective.&quot;ZINC POISONING.Comprehensive animal experiments made by Sir Kenneth Goadby have shown that whilst lead itself is a specific poison, zinc products do not appear to be wholly innocuous, although the extent of poisoning produced by compounds of this metal is less than that produced by compounds of lead. These experiments show that zinc i oxide when inhaled in the form of dust produces definite changes in the body, some of these changes seeming to be common to all metallic poisoning, viz., loss of fat in subcutaneous tissue and loss of fat surrounding the kidney, perinephric fat, and the mesentery or supporting membrane of the intestines, the pathological effects and their rate of development being slower and more insidious than for lead. &apos; It is clear, therefore, that dust of any pigment, be it white lead or zinc, is dangerous, and the obvious course to adopt is to take such measures as will prevent the creation of dust in the process of painting.It has been suggested that up to 5 per cent, of lead may be per-mitted in zinc oxide. Inhalation experiments carried out on cats by Sir Kenneth Goadby have shown that such mixtures cannot he regarded as non-poisonous, as there is in such a compound sufficient lead to produce definite symptoms of poisoning and to render dm
mmal highly susceptible to lead poisoning when exposed suddenly Id a pure infection of lead, &apos;tX During the course of these animal experiments Sir Kenneth JBoadby had occasion to make numerous blood examinations, and is ourid that certain characteristic effects known as baseophilic stain-lc ng occur in the blood not only of animals exposed to the dust of yr ead compounds, but also in that of those exposed to zinc oxide and -,,f o turpentine. Great importance is attached to this test (first sug-ji ested by Grawitz) as a means of early diagnosis by German investi-i: waters (Schmidt, Schonfeld, Teleky) and by Prof. Oarozzi, the head st f the Health Section of the International Labour Office.* ie It is clear that so far as the choice between lead paints and sub-ly titutes is a choice between white lead and zinc white, it is not a m hoice between a poisonous pigment and a non-poisonous pigment.by ots of tat nc jes allossjry cts ian i it )pt bheSUMMARY.(a) It has been shown that the main source of poisoning is the ireation of dust, and that simple and efficient methods of dust pre-lention are available that is, by the abolition of such processes as Ire responsible for the creation of dust.(b) Further, it has been shown that the occupation of painting tails exposure to the vapour of volatile thinners, and that such Mile thinners are responsible to a considerable degree for sick-jess amongst painters.&apos;(c) In the light of recent information, it is clear that there is definite form of poisoning which can only be regarded as paint lisoning, and which will remain so long as volatile thinners are Bed. If prohibition were introduced, the painter would still be ibject to the poisonous effects of paint, and his vitality would.stilllowered thereby, rendering him liable to poisoning by dust and poisoning by zinc if such be the substitute used.(d) The danger of working with a substance which is not gene-illy known to be dangerous scarcely needs to be pointed out; the ilse sense of&apos; security may well cause graver injury to the worker ian in the case where he is dealing with a known danger.(e) &quot;The obvious course of action is to prohibit or regulate opera-ins producing dust, not to prohibit a known poison and to sub-tute therefor a product which is only through ignorance regarded being non-poisonous.er atsbe Schmidt &quot;fiber die Prnphylaxe der QewerbMchenBleivergiflung&quot; Leipzig, 1919. ent mfeld, Medizin Klinilc, 1913.

APPENDIX IIITECHNICAL.There  is no efficient substitute for White Lead for the purpose of painting.Paint is used for one or both, of two purposes, viz., the protection and decoration of surfaces. The decorative function of a paint is secondary in its importance to the protective function.In its broadest sense, paint may be regarded as a material con-sisting of two parts, viz., liquid medium (known as vehicle) and pig-ment. The paint is applied in a liquid condition, containing pig-merit in suspension, this changes into an elastic skin upon exposure to the air, in consequence of the evaporation of the volatile portion of the medium and the ultimate drying by oxidation of the non-volatile or oil constituent of the medium. Thei function of the pigment is to provide solid particles which are ultimately cemented together in the skin of dry paint. Volatile thinning agents are added so as to render the mixture more liquid, and to enable it to be evenly applied to the surface.In order that a paint should dry within a reasonable time, it becomes necessary to; add a small percentage of a material known as a drier, the function of which is to stimulate drying so that it shall take place in reasonable time. Pigments vary in the amount of drier required, and in practice driers are added so that paints may dry in approximately the same period of time,Paint may, therefore, be represented as:   1. Paint pigment.2. Vehicle. Volatile thinner and non-volatile drying oil.The white pigments are the most important, because of the enor-mous and increasing use of white paint and of tints produced by combination of white with coloured materials.In considering the relative value of pigments or paints, the only satisfactory basis of comparison is in respect of the total expense involved in maintaining for any given time a satisfactory protected surface. Pull allowance is thus made for the various factors which contribute towards the ultimate cost of protection, as, for instance, cost of paint and labour in initial painting; cost of preparation of surface for re-painting, when this is necessary; cost of paint and labour for re-painting.It must be borne in mind that the labour involved in ordinary painting operations frequently represents four-fifths of the cost; and that, when surfaces are re-painted, there is a considerable differ-enoe between the amounts of labour required to prepare surfaces which have been previously painted with different pigments.
THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VARIOUS WHITEPIGMENTS. White Lead.The only white pigments which at the present time are of prac-tioal importance are: White lead, basic sulphate of lead, zinc ixide, and lithopone.\ White Lead has been known and recognised as a pigment since&quot; jefore the Christian era, and for many centuries was the only white igment in use. It occupies a unique position by virtue of the [act that it more nearly approaches the ideal white pigment than [ny substitutes which have been brought forward. The main-maintenance of the superiority of white lead as a pigment for this long leriod has not been fortuitous.1 The only sound attitude whioh is in accordance with scientific 01 ruth and common sense is that white lead and its substitutes possessII lerits and demerits. All have their value for specific purposes, hi,n the whole, unprejudiced opinion is in agreement that white e( 3od more nearly approaches the ideal, and that from a practicalIII bandpoint it can be regarded as indispensable if due consideration k i given to the many factors which contribute towards the intrinsic . value of any material as a pigment.3 White lead (hydrated oxy-carbonate of lead) is manufactured by w, various processes, the most common in England being that known&quot; &apos; 1 s the &quot; stack &quot; process, in whioh metallic lead is corroded by means 1X1 f spent tanners&apos; bark in the presence of the vapours of water and n^ oetic acid. Other processes differ mechanically, but the rationale is dentical.White lead is marketed as a dry white powder, or, more usually, s a paste containing linseed oil, which requires thinning before&apos; oi eing applied as a paint.io: The following figures givei, on a pre-war basis and approximately, lcehe amount of white lead manufactured, together with an approxi-lation as to the quantities produced by various processes:  Ml:ctlm ailQuantity of White Lead Produced by Principal Producing Countries.kij Estimated total production, 275,000 tons annually.English Englishtons, dry. tons, dry.U.S.......     ...120,000        Eussia   ......... 14,500na: coel liffl &apos;faJEngland .

Zinc Oxide.The use of zinc oxide as a substitute for white lead was firs suggested by Guy ton de Morveau about 1780, but it was not man! factured on a commercial scale until about 1844 by Jean Leclaire.Two types of zinc oxide are marketed, known as &quot; indirect&quot; and &quot;direct.&quot; &quot;Indirect&quot; oxide is prepared from spelter, and is, therefore, comparatively chemically pure. The process consists of the oxidation by air blast of the zinc vapour, obtained by the dis-tillatiou of zinc from retorts of special construction. The oxide so produced is passed through a series of cooled pipes, thence to settling chambers. The purity and colour of the oxide is deter, mined by the distance it is carried in the settling chamber, and tlit product is graded by this means. This process is used in Europe, and to some small extent in Pennsylvania. The oxide is excellent in colour, and comparatively free of impurities.The &quot; direct &quot; process, which produces zinc oxide direct from the ore, is of American origin, and has been applied since 1855 to the New Jersey Pranklinite ores.   The New Jersey ore is a com-complex of franklinite, willemite, calcite, and occasionally zincite, hav-ing an average zinc content of 25 per cent.   The process takes place in three stages, viz.: (1) Removal of sulphur from ore by roasting; (2) magnetic separation and jigging of roasted product; and (3) reduction of zinc oxide in ore to metal with volatilisation and sub-sequent oxidation.   The oxide is collected in chambers, followed by bag filters.     The product so- obtained compares favourably iii chemical purity with that obtained by the &quot; indirect&quot; process, but it was found that this was not maintained when western ores were treated.   This is due to the different chemical composition of the western ores, which are blendes containing lead as well as zinc, The &quot; direct &quot; process is applied in Europe, but the European direct oxides almost invariably contain lead, and that fact is recognised in some continental specifications.   The colour of &quot; direct &quot; oxides other than New Jersey is not equal to that of the &quot; indirect &quot; oxides, At present there is noi generally accepted opinion as to the superiority of one type of oxide over the other,  though it claimed that the small quantity of. basic lead sulphate present in some &quot; direct&quot; oxides increases the stability of the resulting paint film.Zinc Oxide is sold either&apos; as a dry powder (specific gravity approx, 5.6) or as an oil paste, containing 14 to 20 per cent, of linseed oil
Basic Sulphate of Lead oh Sublimed Lead.BriJThe use of basic lead sulphate as a paint material was first sug-nfsted by Bartlett, in 1866. Little progress was made until with-ixian. is s c dii !&amp; e recent years, but now the product has very extensive use in - United States of America, and more recently its manufacture i been introduced intoi England. The process consists in the pacing of high-grade galena, which has received a preliminary ging and crushing. The furnaoing is carried out in a special Jpe of blast furnace, whereby lead sulphide is volatilised and j jjbsequently oxidised.   The resulting basic sulphate is collected dryjteJgoose-neck condensers and bag filters. tj/Phe chemical composition of basic sulphate varies between the npounds (PbO, PhSO4) and (PbO, 3PbS04).   The impurities jgj usist of foreign substances, either volatilised from the galena or rried over mechanically by the blast.When zinciferous galena is used, a notable quantity (about 5 per roip.) of zinc is found in the product.   The slight creamy colour &quot;&quot;&quot;quently observed is attributed to iron.   The product consists particles of uniform size in an extremely fine state of division, t is sold dry or in an oil paste containing about 9 per cent, [seed oil.   The specific gravity of the dry pigment is approximately185Xfflha )lai injI ( sullLithopone.d I jithopone (or lithophone) is a generic name given to a class of f i ments of varying composition. The highest grade lithopone con-, bi is about 28 per cent, zinc sulphide, 70 per cent, barium sulphate, weiier cent, zino oxide, whilst the lower grades contain less zino Aide and more barium sulphate, the reduction usually being zin selected by mixing the high-grade with diluents, iirelte manufacture of lithopone was first patented by J. B. Orr nlsi876, and the product sold as Orr&apos;s White Enamel and Charlton xidiite. The manufacture of lithopone, although originally an -idcdish process, has not made much headway in England, but on tl Continent of Europe the process has assumed huge proportions, it i U.S.A. production is also considerable.tit&apos;: roducts of varying composition (frequently mixtures of litho-paii e with other white pigments) are sold under fancy trade names, oh give no indication as to composition. The term &quot; white :&quot; is sometimes wrongly applied to lithopone. ithopone is prepared by the mutual precipitation of barium hate and zino sulphide, using solutions of barium sulphide and I sulphate. Mutual precipitation ensures homogeneity otf pro-t, which is most desirable in a paint material. Ire solution of zinc sulphate is prepared direct from the ore in pany, whilst the American practice is to dissolve spelter or by-ilucts containing zinc. Barium, sulphide is prepared from lum sulphate by reduction with carbon in specially constructedpro: d oil
furnaces. The furnace mass is leached with water, and the sold tion so obtained purified. The precipitate of lithopone is dri^ and furnaced at high temperature, and is then quenched in water, which increases the density, and at the same time reducl the oil absorption.In the operation of furnacing, a small portion of the zinc sulphid; is converted into oxide. Various additions are made to the furnat charge to minimise this oxidation, the substance added being on] whioh will on volatilisation produce an inert atmosphere in furnace charge, and so prevent oxidation. The quenched materii] is ground in water, and the product dried.Lithopoue is at times seriously sensitive toi light, in strong suiij light a painted surface sometimes rapidly becoming grey-black i colour. The white colour is regained in the absence of light. Tl cause oif this phenomenon is not understood, and though man remedies have been suggested, none can claim, to be absolutely off el tive, the change occurring in specially treated products with dig concerting irregularity.Lithopoue is sold as a dry powder (specific gravity approx. 4.2) as an oil paste containing from 17 to 18 per cent, linseed oil..Ready Mixed Paints.The foregoing covers practically all the white pigments in i as bases for oil paints. Many additions are made when ready-mial paints are prepared, but usually the principal base consists of oi ofc more of the four substances described.The sale of ready-mixed paints to the painter is established on s extensive scale in America, and in many cases the paints are coi posite, being frequently mixtures of...two or more of the followiiil viz.:  Zinc sulphide, white lead, zinc oxide, leaded zinc, lithopoii basic sulphate of lead, gypsum, talc, silica, alumina, barium ci bonate, barytes (natural and artificial), calcium carbonate, mi nesite,. china clay, French chalk, asbestos, etc.Ready-mixed paints afford excellent opportunities for aduli ation of both base and vehicle, and so serious has this become: the TJ.S.A. that certain States have enacted that all paint tins i bear a label on which is clearly indicated the composition oft contents. -The sale of ready-mixed paints is increasing in England, thoij as yet the painter buys the bulk of his white pigments in the of a,stiff paste, which he himself reduces to a liquid state by able, thinners.DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ABOVE-NAMED . - -   - PIGMENTS&quot;.White Lead/1. Durability. White lead is a chemical compound capable of M action with the linseed oil with which it is ground.   This interacti1I &apos;
akes place during storage, and results in the solution of a small but Jefinite quantity, of lead in the leaded oil, which oil permeates the ^hole mass,t It is  probable that this change explains the well-known 1 act that white lead paste improves - with age, and it is certain . hat this secondary reaction is to a large extent responsible for he ease with whioh white lead works under the brush.   It is also he cause of white lead paint drying more quickly than do&apos; substi-I utes, the permeation of the oil-lead compound being throughout ;he particles of white lead instead of the particles being merely ri jnveloped in an artificially prepared medium of this type, as is the case with substitutes.   The ease with whioh white lead paint can   be applied by a painter is not mere fiction, but is established on rj, many years of practice.Further, when white lead dries, a combination of white lead and g linseed oil takes place, resulting in the formation of a varnish-&apos; j like material, whioh when it hardens possesses considerable elas-ticity, so that it acts in conformity with the surface to which . it is applied&apos; as the surface contracts or expands with variations of temperature.   This is one of its most characteristic features, and explains why it does not crack so markedly as many olf its substi-tutes.The destructive agents which have to be considered in regard to - i the decay of paint are many; among them are change of tem-. r temperature, rain, contamination with acids, etc., in the case of town air, soot, sulphuric acid, sulphurous acid, etc.   Although white lead is in sonic respects a comparatively unstable substance, yet, from a chemical, point of view, it has the great advantage that . the final products of the changes effected by these destructive agents ire compounds possessing considerable chemical stability i.e., in-soluble compounds are formed which are not removed from the PClllm, whereas in the case of the substitutes it is found that the destructive influences result in the.formation of soluble bodies which Jare dissolved out from the film, thereby weakening it, and ulti-, Jmately causing its decay.   Instances olf this are the action of sul-^Jphuric and sulphurous acids which are present in town air and in),m1soiot.s sol   White lead has a defect in that it is blackened on exposure to sulphuretted hydrogen.   The more frequent cause of the blackened ,y paint in cities is, however, the deposit of soot, which discolours not 6 j only white lead, but also, its substitutes.     While sulphuretted 5 hydrogen blackens white lead, it does not disintegrate it. &quot;  It is claimed that zinc products are not blackened by sulphuretted hydrogen gas.   This is not true for &quot; direct &quot; zinc oxide which oon-ED tains lead. It is true for &quot; indirect &quot; zinc oxide, but a similar chemical-tal. change is involved which, although not apparent, results in the formation of a much less stable compound than results when white 0if jjead is similarly affected. This instability means early disintegration. nY.aM 2. Hiding Powers. One of the characteristics of white lead is its
high specific gravity (approximately 6.5 to 6.7).     The specifuL gravities of zinc oxide and lithopone are much less.   There is thujj for equal weights, less in bulk of white lead than otf zinc oxidj and, therefore, it is obviously true that zinc oxide powder, col sidered by itself, has in one sense a greater &quot;covering&quot; 01 &quot;spreading&quot; power than white lead.    For practical purposes, however, the important point is the relative powers of concealingj given surface (i.c, relative opacity or &quot; hiding &quot; power), in wind zinc oxide is inferior to white lead.   The powder of zinc oxide, i also of lithopone, is in an extremely finei state of division, and-regular in the size of particles.   The particles of white lead aril not uniform; this gives the white lead film greater mechanical stability, and also- explains the inferiority of zinc oxide paint when applied to mouldings in doors, etc., and other intricacies.   In order to get the requisite fluidity for working, zinc oxide must be thinneJ with more linseed oil than is needed for white lead; given the sanit degree of fluidity, the hiding power of zinc oxide is, therefore, inferior to an equal weight of white lead.   As one of the essentials of good painting is to brush the paint out thin the thinner tit successive coats, the better and more durable being the work-tti result is that, with a reasonable degree of fluidity, a larger numta otf coats will be) necessary for zinc oxide than for white lead.Basic sulphate of lead, zinc oxide and lithopone are all pigment&apos; in a very fine state of division, and many attempts have been mad) to reproduce therein a condition of physical separation similar to that which obtains in white lead. This is usually done by ad&apos; mixture with various so-called reinforcing materials, such as barium sulphate, French chalk, china clay, silica, etc.Zinc Oxide.Zinc oxide does not enter into combination with the oil with which it is ground as readily as does white lead. Such inter-action as does take place is not an advantage for the zino oxide paint, but a disadvantage. As has been stated, it requires more oil than white lead, and the dry film of zinc paint, therefore, contain! more oil; owing to the fact that the film dries into a hard and brittle skin, it has little elasticity, and does not change in unison with the surface to which it is applied. The ultimate product finally blisters, cracks or becomes translucent in the process decay.Lithopone.Lithopone is a product largely used for interior work, but.. cannot be regarded seriously as a material for outside work. Its unreliability and lack of resistancel toi weather when used for exteriors are generally admitted. As in the case of zinc oxide, when a lithopone paint film is exposed to air containing sulphuris or sulphurous acids, soluble zinc salts are produced which are readilj washed out. Further, lithopone has the serious disadvantage that, under certain unknown conditions, a white surface will suddenlj
ange colour and become grey or black without any apparent lason: this behaviour is most sporadic, and as yet no satisfactory planatdon has been brought forward.Comparative Tests. The white lead manufacturers from their own experience are con-lent that white lead is on an all-round basis far superior to any of :e substitutes which have been brought forward.    They prefer, ll* jwever, to bring independent evidence to prove this point.Dutch Commission. In Holland, a Commission appointed by the ajovernment in 1903 was instructed to investigate the respective a operties and to consider &quot; to what extent white lead paint could 5 replaced by zinc-white paint or in other manner.&quot; The Commis-jon made a large number of experiments, and its Report, issued 18 308/9, although open to serious criticism, is sufficient evidence that jj bite lead alone possesses certain characteristic propertie. It con-r( ins conclusions that:  1. White lead paint withstands the action of sulphuric acid better than zinc white, but is blackened by sulphuretted 1   hydrogen gas.2. White lead paint on wood outside is superior to zinc white paints where there is moisture or exposure to sulphuric acid, on Portland cement and zinc, and also on iron previously painted with red lead or oxide of iron. Zinc white paint is equal to white lead paint after five years if not much exposed i to sulphuric acid.   &apos;3. For inside painting zinc white paint is equal to white lead paint provided there is not much exposure to sulphuric acid.4. Zino white paint covers as well as white lead paint; it costs more to use for repainting woodwork, but no more for the first painting of woodwork.5. Lithopone is unfit for outside use. 6. Red lead can alone be used for paint under water.It will be seen that, speaking broadly, and allowing for the differ-Jices of the climate, etc., of Holland, these findings are in agree-ent with what has been stated previously herein. The superiority white lead over zinc oxide in respect of durability where there is kposure to sulphuric acid is pointed out, the effect of sulphuric acid las on zinc oxide being to form a water-soluble compound, affect-jig both internal painting; these are the conditions obtaining in Jrge towns where there is most painting. The conclusions of the Dutch Commission differ from, the findings every other inquiry in stating that zino white has a covering bwer equal to white lead. Criticisms by the Associations of MasteT Winters, made during the course of the experiments, showed that lie formulas of the Commission for zinc white paint were too thick br practical application (Memorials of the Bond van Nederlansche childerspatroons,   October, 1907 ; August, 1908).   The Commit
sion impliedly admitted this in an interim, report, ^ stating tls &quot;there is. a difference between the various sorts of linseed oil an &quot; the quantities of paint which they consume, and if the rasA &quot; painters had taken this circumstance into consideration inst^ &quot; of following to the letter the recipes given in the report, the &quot;would have obtained the same results as the commission.&quot;B. (switzerland. The findings of the Dutch Commission aj (allowing for the special circumstances of climate and the unfoi unfortunate practical mistake in regard to the mixing with linseed oil in general conformity with the results of similar enquiries by tl Federal authorities of Switzerland (see p. 59 hereof), &quot; th is no effective substitute for white lead for outside fainting.&quot;C. geneva.   A similar finding was announced by the Corami sion held in Geneva in 1907, which reported that &quot; White lead is necessity for which zinc Oxide is not an att-rowid substitute &quot; (tM p. 60 hereof).D. U.1s1a. A series of tests have been made in America unde: the aegis of the master painters, etc. The most reliable tests wliic have taken place in that country are those carried out by Professo Ladd in North Dakota, and in the words of one of the leading paii technologists in that country:  &quot; The fence tests conducted by Professor Ladd, of non Dakota, have invariably pointed to the superiority of whit lead as a pigment.   The Havre de Grace paint tests show era clusively that red lead is the best paint for the protection o iron and steel, and in this case there -has been no doubt rais* as to the results obtained.   Undoubtedly the tests which haw been conducted here have had influence upon our legislate! bodies, and have resulted in the prevention of legislatisi^ adverse to the use of white lead.&quot; The difficulty in tests of this kind is to ensure that they can Is conducted without any element of controversy entering to a material extent in the interpretation of the results.   It must be pointed out that the United States is the largest user and producer of -whitt) pigments and that the quantity of white lead made and used in that country is more than half the world&apos;s production.E. H.M office of works, great britain. The only evi dence which has been brought forward from Government Depart ments in this country since 1893 consists of the evidence given by H.M.&apos;. Office of Works before the Departmental Committe appointed in 1911. The evidence then presented is criticised in detail in the Minority Report, of which the late author, it maj be said, was a man with an international reputation as a craftsmai in this particular industry of painting. His criticisms carry men weight than the criticisms of any white lead manufacturer; he wa( disinterested, and staked his reputation on his report. This is not the place, nor is it the occasion, to discuss in any detail the methods of procedure adopted by the Departmental Committee. It is suffi cient to say that the white lead makers had. no opportunity of erossj
examination or of offering counter-evidence.   They were kept in the dark throughout as to the evidence the Committee had received.   It J was apparent that the evidence they brought forward was not wel-&apos; corned, and the prejudice and lack of courtesy manifested to some t of the distinguished foreign scientists was a matter of public comment and of regret to the white lead icorroders who had, at their own expense, brought men with international reputations and of til high independent Government standing.The slip-shod experiments which have been carried out by H.M. r Office of Works cannot be seriously considered as a basis for legis-5/1 lation, and as a recent illustration of this, attention must be drawn to a circular issued by the Home Secretary regarding the use of in lead paint in the priming of iron and steel.   It is obvious from \ 1 details which have been supplied that the experiments at Kew on ( which the conclusions are based have been carried out with no pretence to the scientific accuracv which is necessary for sneh in-.m vestigations. /illegitimate$ Views of Master Painters.pa   The master painters of this country cannot be regarded as inter-ested parties in this matter; indeed, their interest would rather be 101 towards the adoption of substitutes, because their experience has ivli shown that painting must he done more frequently if substitutes ci are adopted.mi The National Associations of Master Painters and Decorators of aii England, Ireland and Wales have passed resolutions in favour of ha the policy of regulations of painting as against the &quot;policy of prohibition-ati prohibition, and have suggested simple regulations to avoid the danger atiof lead dust from dry rubbing down. The following ,extract from the report of the Irish Association indicates the experience of these in master painters with the use of substitutes during the war:   keT &quot; The master painter has a two-fold responsibility in10 &quot; carrying out his business first to the public who employ him wn&apos;      &quot; to secure the best materials for his work, and second to thetli      &quot; workmen engaged in that work to safeguard them, as far as &quot; possible from dangers to life and health.ei &quot; The shortage of white lead during the war has given ouripai &quot; members a unique experience with all the leadless light-gwi &quot; coloured paints in the market, and the results have been so ait! &quot; unfavourable that we state without hesitation that no sub-Jd       &quot; stitute suitable for outside work which can compare withmi &quot; white lead has come to our notice. The time has not been smi &apos;* sufficiently long to enable us to speak with equal certainty wo &quot; regarding inside work, but there are not wanting signs that e w &quot; here, too, lead is much superior to the so-called zinc paints. &apos;-&apos; is n -tho SUMMARY.su^ This evidence, when summarised, indicates in the most positive cros runner that white lead is an indispensable article for paint pur-
xxv111poses, and Unit the position to-day does not differ from that which obtained in 1893, when a British Departmental Committee on the various lead industries reported: &apos;&apos; In the past a large amount of thought, labour, time and &quot; money have been expended by many experts in the search for &quot; a substitute for carbonate of lead. Several compounds have &quot; been mentioned to the Committee as being equal to white &quot; lead and capable of taking its place, if only the prejudice of &quot; middlemen and dealers could be removed so as to secure for &quot;them a fair field in the paint market. One of these com-&quot; pounds, and the one on which most stress has been laid, is &quot; oxide of zinc. This has been used with success for internal &quot; decoration, but for rough surfaces and for exposure to heat, &quot; cold and rain it does not possess the qualities for whicli &quot;white lead is conspicuous namely, covering-power and &quot; durability.&quot; Moreover, the price of oxide of zinc is greater than that &quot; of carbonate of lead. With regard to all these so-called &quot; substitutes, the Committee have invariably found that on &quot; closer inquiry of persons competent to judge and unpreju-&quot; diced on either side, the substance in question was in some &quot;particulars inferior; and they came to the conclusion tlm\ &quot; there is at present no substitute that can take the place of &quot; carbonate of leadx,&quot; (Report of Departmental Committee on the various lead indus-tries.   Cd. 7239.)
APPENDIX IV. FINDINGS OF FOREIGN COMMISSIONS.Lead poisoning lias been the subject of recent investigation in a number of Continental countries Austria, Belgium, France, Ger-many, and Switzerland. With the exception of France, these have i all concentrated upon the danger of lead dust, and have evolved regulations to meet this: in particular, they have singled out and prohibited the special operation of the dry rubbing down of paint, as the operation most productive of lead dust.AUSTRIA. Commission^ report.A policy of Regulation was adopted in 1908 by the Austrian Commission on Lead Poisoning after the most thorough investi-gation of the subject yet made. (Bleivergiftungen in Hiitten-mannisehen und Gewerblichen Betrieben, 7 vols.)The Commission emphasise the danger of lead dust. From the statistics, they found &quot; in insidei painting. ... a quite special pro-cess causing poisoning which does not occur in outside painting the dry pumice-stoning and rubbing, ... of white lead.&quot; While in Vienna and other cities there was a relatively small use of white bad for inside purposes, with a relatively high rate of lead poison-ng, &quot; the facts in regard to outside painting are notably otherwise; &apos; there is a large use of white lead and red lead, and a relatively j&apos; small amount of poisoning. Having regard to the undoubted I&apos; advantages of white lead for outside painting, and of red lead &apos; (especially for painting iron), which are declared by all in the &apos; trade, there is not likely to be any decrease in these figures, the &apos; more so in that the question of substitutes for outside painting is &apos; still in the stage of experiment and enquiry. The recommen-&apos; dations for Regulations for painting show sufficiently that there 1 is still much which may be done for the protection of the health of &quot;workers in outside painting with white lead and red lead. In &apos;&apos; accordance with all experience, the figures of lead sickness in these &apos; occupations by thorough hygienic precautions could be reduced to &apos;a minimum.&quot;Regulations.Regulations were issued in April, 1908, in consequence of the commission&apos;s recommendations, based upon the German regulations : 1905:- &quot; 71. Dry rubbing down and dry pumice-stoning prohibited; j   white lead not to be used for inside&apos;painting.   ,        &apos;2. Medical inspection periodically where more than 20 employed.   Suspension from work until recovery from lead j   poisoning.
Till ealBELGIUM. Regulations.After a controversy and Parliamentary discussion in Belg (1904 to 1909) upon a proposal to prohibit the use of white le^-this proposal was abandoned, and administrative regulations weilj issued on 25th July, 1910: 1. Dry rubbing down and dry pumice-stoning prohibited white lead to be ground in oil.2. Medical inspection periodically and medical registaj suspension of workers showing signs of poisoning; exclusion froi all dangerous processes of those specially susceptible; total of elusion of alcoholics (s&apos;adonnant a 1&apos;ivrogneriei).3. Washing appliances and special clothing must be proposal vided by employers and used by workers.These regulations again are aimed at lead dust and the dusl processes, requiring white lead to be used, not dry, but in the foil of paste, Le., ground in oil, as is largely the present practice &apos; Great Britain. There are the usual provisions for cleanliness, an special provisions for medical inspection. They specially exchid alcoholics, and prohibit bringing spirits to work.3. Washing appliances, and  (in certain cases)  s clothing to be provided&apos; by employer; special rooms for wash ing, and clothes where more than 20 employed.4. Printed advice how- to avoid lead poisoning. 5. Lead contents to be labelled on paint cans, etc. The Regulations aim at (a) primarily the prevention of lead dust by prohibiting the specially dusty processes of dry rubbing down and pumice-stoning, and also prohibiting the use of whit lead for inside paintings that being the chief occasion for thesij dust-producing processes, and white lead being in fact (in thi special circumstances of Austrian towns) little used inside. Tin other objects are (b) medical supervision, (c) cleanliness, and (d instruction.Results.The statistics of lead poisoning among the members (how painters) of the compulsory Sickness Insurance Fund (Krankenj kasse) of Vienna, show that whereas both the number of oases an the percentage of cases to members had been increasing immediate]; prior to the regulations, the cases fell in the period 1907-1910 (thi last year of available figures) from. 208 to 138, the percentage falliiij from 5.3 to 3.5, a reduction equal to 33 per cent, in actual cases,
GERMANY. Regulations.Regulations were issued by the German Imperial Government in June, 1905, after an investigation of whioh there is no public account.   These comprise:  1. Dry rubbing down and dry pumice-stoning prohibited. 2. Medical inspection half-yearly and medical register: suspension from work until recovery from luad poisoning.3. Washing appliances and special rooms for washing and clothes to be provided by employer; rules by employer (a) to require special work-clothes, and (b) washing before eating or drinking, and prohibiting (c) smoking and spirit-drinking dur-ing work.4. Printed advice how to avoid lead poisoning. It will be seen that these regulatioais are especially aimed at lead 15i dust and the dusty processes of dry rubbing down and dry pumice-jn stoning. There is no prohibition of the use of white lead for inside m painting, which in the Austrian regulations was due to the special &apos; circumstances of Austria..ui ia( reaecbed roipriasf or) eail luResults.There are few figures available for the period since the introduc-tion of regulations, but;(l) the figures for the hospitals in Prussia show a reduction from 390 in 1905 to 259 in 1908; (2) the figures for the painter members of, the Sickness Insurance Eund (Kranken-kasse), of Berlin, showing a progressive reduction in the percentage of lead sickness from 7.3 in 1907 to 5.4 in 1910, a reduction of 26 per cent, of actual oases.SWITZERLAND. Swiss Federal Council. , . , A proposal for the prohibition of the use of white lead was re-ferred by the Federal Council in 1902 to a Commission. Following the recommendations of the report, the Federal Council decided against, immediate prohibition for the reasons that: (1) White lead is indispensable for other industries than painting, such as painting electric accumulators, pottery; (2) the protection of home industries. They resolved to stop the1 use of white lead in all Government Departments for four years, and to further consider a general prohibition if justified by this experience.      :In June, 1908, the Commission-again reported.to the Federal Council upon the results of the&apos; four.years&apos; experience as follows:-1., White lead is indispensable, for outside painting in present con-ditions? &quot;2. For inside painting there are substitute? for white lead, although more costly, 3. Red lead especially is indispensable-in particular for iron construction, for which leadless materials give unsatisfactory results.
XXXllThe Federal Council then determined that:-1. There is no effective substitute for white lead for out. side painting.2. Any enquiry into the subject must follow strictly scientific methods, and would extend over many years, and must consider the general industrial circumstances. Such an en-quiry is not expedient, having regard to the unfortunate ex-periences of foreign countries.3. The limited prohibition of the use of white lead for inside painting is not expedient.The Federal Council therefore revoked the general prohibition of the use of white lead in Government Departments for outside painting.Genevan Commission.The Report of! the Commission appointed in 1904 by the Conseil d&apos;Etat of the State of Geneva, to consider a proposal for the pro-hibition of the use of white lead paint, is probably the most illumin-ating survey of the matter from a general and legislative point of view.   &quot; La Ceruse &quot; (pub. Geneva Kundig et Fils, 1907).The suggestion of prohibition was prompted by the then recent agitation in France&apos;, and the Commission devoted special study to the French proceedings. They criticised the French way of treating the subject as being both partisan and slip-shod.The Commission heard the evidence of a large number of persons, representative of all classes concerned, the overwhelming majority being against prohibition, and emphasising the indispensability of white lead and red lead, especially for outside painting. Their con-elusions may be summarised as follows:   .,&quot;1. White lead as used for painting in Geneva does not constitute a social danger necessitating a measure so extreme as prohibition.&quot;2. White lead is a necessity for which zino oxide is not an all-round substitute.&quot; 3. Painting with white lead is not a real danger when simple precautions are taken.&quot;4. Lead dust may be avoided by the use of white lead in the form of paste, i.e., ground in oil, and by preventing dry rubbing down and dry pumice-stoning and burning off of old paint&quot; (&quot;La Ceruse,&quot; pp. 17-19).As in every inquiry, stress is laid on the predominant danger of lead dust and on the necessity of avoiding the specially dusty pro-cesses of dry rubbing down. The Commission found that the dry rubbing down of old paint was unnecessary, and that the dry rubbing down of fresh paint was less dangerous.The report finds as proved the superiority of white lead for (1) durability, (2), &quot; covering &quot; or &quot; hiding &quot; power (pointing out that three coats of zinc oxide are needed, as against two coats of white lead); and, therefore, (3) the greater relative cost of the use of zinc oxide, not only in material, but more importantly in labour
xxx1111(&quot; La Ceruse,&quot; p. 41).   It also asserts the absolute inddspensability of red lead.   It is remarked that if the intrinsic inferiority of zinc A oxide be remedied by science, there will be no need to prohibit, as 9 white lead would then be automatically superseded by zinc oxide (p. 39).Partial prohibition of lead, i.e., for inside painting, was re-jected, because of the impossibility of distinguishing between in-side and outside painting and the practical impossibility of pre-venting its surreptitious use inside (p. 67).The objection of the need of inspection for the enforcement of regulations was met by referring to the necessity of even more inspection to enforce prohibition (p. 74).The Commission stated that if they were to have regard to facts and to principle, they could only come to one general conclusion,&quot; The danger is not sufficient to necessitate the prohibition &quot;of a material, the careful use of which does not constitute a &quot; social peril.&quot;&quot; There is an industrial risk, and we do not suppose that &quot;it can ever be abolished in painting any more than in any &quot; other occupation. At the forge, the slatei-quarry, the loom, &quot;as a. fileworker or a dyer, the worker is exposed to risks &quot; often more serious &quot;&quot; We do not desire, by yielding to the quite natural senti-&quot; ments of those who are concerned for the workers and demand &quot; prohibition, unnecessarily to do the business of certain finan-&quot; cial and commercial monopolies and of certain manufacturers &quot; of zinc, who are and who will be the masters of the price of it &quot; (pp. 64 and 69).Regulations.The regulations issued in December, 1907, comprise the following [provisions:  1. White lead to be used only in the form of paste, i.e., ground in oil; dry rubbing down and burning off of old paint prohibited; dry pumice-stoning of freshly-painted surfaces not to be continuous.2. Washing appliances, special work-clothes and store places for ordinary clothes toi be provided by the employer.3.

(g)Report on the examination of eight samples of paint taken from the Teat Board on the roof of the General Poet Offioe,     Laboratory Numbers 349-350 &amp; 405-410.The composition of tne paint as determined by analysis is shewn in the accompanying tables side by side with the specified composition of the three coats making up the total thickness of paint. Samples 3 to 8 were taken in pairs in which the undercoatings and primings are the same in each pair but the finishing coats differ in that one contains oil and varnish and the other oil only.      The effect of the varnish can thus be seen.Prom the results of the analysis it can be stated generally:-1.     That in the case of the paints ground in oil, much of the oil has disappeared; but where varnish has been used, the loss of the medium is distinctly less.II.     There is evidence of the formation of carbonates, sulphides, and sulphates by atmospheric action.       Where the paint was found to be discoloured; lead sulphite was detected; and where chalking was most apparent, there was much additional carbonate present. It is noticeable, however, that in the case of the varnish paints the deleterious effects of exposure to the atmosphere is less distinctly marked than when oil alone has been used.This is clearly shewn in samples 7 and 8 in whioh it will be seen that there is in 7 a much greater conversion of the white lead into lead sulphate and lead sulphide than is the case with
8 which contains varnish.In 5 and 6 also an appreciable quantity of the zinc oxide has been converted into carbonate, but in 5 to a greater extent than in 6.In these two samples more leadwas found than was apparently present in the original &apos;  paints and the proportion of zinc was less.     It was also observed in the other samples containing zinc that there was a diminution in the proportion of zinc and an increase in the proportion of lead.     But this was again less apparent in the varnish paints. The conclusion to be drawn is that zinc oxide ground in oil is more readily attacked and washed away by exposure to the atmosphere than the lead compounds.GOVERNMENT LABORATORY. (Signed) T.H.

Notes on some statements contained in the Questionnaire issued by the International Labour Offioe. (Enclosure E.)As mentioned in paragraph 11 of the attached covering report it was stated in the House of Lords on the 27th March, in reply to a question asked by Lord Askwith regarding this Questionnaire that the Government when replying to the Questionnaire, will call the attention of the International Labour Office to any points resulting from investigations or experiments by ?/hich the memorandum can be supplemented or corrected or any inaccuracies or omissions remedied. In this connection it is thought that attention should be drawn to the following statements which are either incorrect on facts or are contrary to authoratative British opinion.(a)   On page 9 it is stated that:-&quot;lead poisoning............ is brought about&quot;through the open tracts of the body of which &quot;the digestive canal is undoubtedly the most &quot;important.     The skin also affords a means &quot;of entry for the poison, by direct contact. &quot;The respiratory canals have only a &quot;secondary importance in this connection and &quot;even this is still contested,Tbls is directly contrary to the t conclusion reached on this point by the DepartmentalCommittee which was that     &quot;entry by the&quot;respiratory system is by far the most&quot;dangerous to the worker.,... the risk&quot;entailed by entry by the alimentary system&quot;as a consequence of swallowing lead&quot;dust.......is small, but not negligible...(j)2-rr
&quot;entry through the unbroken skin possesses &quot;points of theoretical interest, but the &quot;amount so entering in practise is so small &quot;as to be entirely negligible (page 82 of &quot;Report CD. 7882)(b) On page 20 the statement is made that;-&quot;all the experts now agree in saying that &quot;oxides of zinc re-act just as well on the &quot;freo acid3 in linseed oil.It should, however, be stated that there still appears to be considerable difference of opinion on the point, many authorities holding the view, which is shared by Dr. Fox of the Government&apos;Laboratory, that there is-no chemical combination between the zinc base&quot; and oil medium such as takes place in white lead paint.     This point is dealt with further in paragraph (20a) of the1 covering report. :;&quot;(c) Page 25 contains the following statement under sub-heading &quot;practical Experience&quot;.&quot;enquiries undertaken in Prance, Belgium, &quot;Italy, England, etc., resulted in the &quot;prohibition of the use of white lead in &quot;the painting of interiors.This statement is incorrect as nonsuch prohibition as is implied, exists in this country at the present or in either of the other countries mentioned so far as can be ascertained.(d) It is stated on page 27 in reference to &quot;lithopones&quot; as substitutes for white lead that:-
&quot;those substitutes are innocuous and answer/er &quot;all requirements from the technical point &quot;of view     (lines 11 and 12)It is, however, difficult to reconcile this with the statement immediately following (on line 17) to the effect that:-&quot;they are not particularly suitable for&quot;outdoor work.&quot;The unsuitability of lithopone paints for exterior work is well known,(e) On page 28 it is stated in regard to possible courses of action that&quot;the choice lies between entire prohibition &quot; and no prohibition&quot;With regard to this it will be noted &quot;from paragraph 24 of the covering report that the majority of the Governments which have taken action have decided to deal with tho matter by Regulations,(f) It is stated on page 29 that:-&quot;researches........... have placed it beyond&quot;doubt that oxide of zinc properly treated &quot;can be used as the basis of a product &quot;giving every advantage given by white lead &quot;whether&apos; in covering power drying qualities &quot;or durability.This statement is. not confirmed by the more recent experience of this Department and the conclusions reached therefrom as recorded in paragraph 18 and subsequent paragraphs of the covering report; neither does the experience of thi Department allow of agreement with the assumption
contained in the first question of t.h Questionnaireon page 31 reading:-&quot;in view of the fact that it is now &quot;technically possible to replace white &quot;lead in painting by efficient substitutes.&quot;
