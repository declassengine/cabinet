[This Document is tne Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;^Government. ]   &quot; &quot;Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1921.SECRET. C.P.-2950.CABINET..   FORESTRY EXPENDITURE.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer with reference to the Memorandum submitted by the Forestry Commission (.(7.P. 2929).THE Forestry Commission seek the authority of the Cabinet to continue without delay, and even to accelerate, the full forestry programme contemplated in 1919 without regard to the alteration of financial conditions which has arisen since that date.In the reservation attached by him to the Report of the Forestry Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee issued in 1918 the Treasury representative observed: &quot; It must be admitted, however, that the expenditure proposed is very considerable, and that the financial results are likely to be unfavourable to the Exchequer; and it is to be doubted how far the claims of afforestation are such as could demand priority among the many urgent claims which are likely to be brought against the Exchequer upon the conclusion of the war.&quot;In my opinion present conditions bear out this warning. In this connection I would draw the attention of the Cabinet to the principles proposed to be laid down in the draft Circular to public Departments, relating to the reduction of public expenditure recently circulated by me (CP. 2919). In that circular it is pointed out that the desired reduction of expenditure in&apos; 1922-23 can only be effected by a special reduction of &quot;optional&quot; expenditure, requiring a common effort by all Departments and entailing heavy and general sacrifices of services which are in themselves desirable.Forestry expenditure, which will not produce any appreciable return for thirty-five or forty years, and can never be expected to yield more than (say) 4 per cent, on the capital expended, is peculiarly suitable for postponement until less difficult financial conditions prevail, and the contention that the operations of the Commission are being economically carried out does not alter the fact that heavy capital expenditure is involved.I do not gather that the Commission dispute the interpretation placed by the Treasury upon the construction of &quot;The Forestry Act, 1919.&quot; Under section 8 of the Act it is clearly within the powers of the Treasury and of Parliament to regulate in any particular years of the ten-year period the amount of the grants to be voted to the Forestry Fund. It is argued, however, that the reduction in the scale of expenditure during the next two years proposed by the Treasury would be contrary to the policy announced by the Government in 1919, and would involve a sacrifice of efficiency.This may be admitted. - But it must be recognised that the reduction of public expenditure specified in the Circular above-mentioned cannot be effected without postponement and modification of programmes contemplated in 1919, and that in many.cases a sacrifice of efficiency will be necessitated by the financial exigencies of the immediate future.I would observe, however, that in suggesting that, if the Treasury decision is adhered to, the Forestry Commission will be left in the position of having to employ a whole-time technical staff to undertake 15 percent, of the work for which they were appointed, the Commission appear to overlook the fact that the bulk of their staff is at present employed on a temporary basis only, and can therefore be reduced, if necessary. I am unable to attach weight to the argument that the scheme should be regarded as affording relief to unemployment. The numbers involved are comparatively inconsiderable, and, moreover, it may be hoped that the present emergency in this respect may not continue throughout 1922-23.The programme laid down in the Forestry Report of 1918 appears to have been based mainly upon the hypothesis of a possible emergency similar to that of the&apos;   [6265] \a
Great War arising in about forty years&apos; time, and I cannot agree that it must be regarded as exempt from any temporary modifications or postponement which may be called for by immediate and pressing financial difficulties.The protest of the Forestry Commission is a typical example of the difficulties with which I shall inevitably be faced in calling upon all Departments to effect drastic reductions of their services next year. It is natural that a Department which lias set itself with enthusiasm to carry out a programme which is in itself desirable should demur to submitting to reductions or even postponement. But similar sacrifices will have to be made throughout the public service, and I ask the Cabinet to support me in enforcing in this particular case the application of the principles laid doWn generally in C.P.-2919.(Initialled)        R S. H.Treasury Chambers, S. W., May 19, 1921.
