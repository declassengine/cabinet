. J .     196THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET. SAFEGUARD!NG OF INDUSTRIES ACT. APPLICATION TO FRANCE,, BELGIUh, AND ITALY.Memorandum by the President &quot;of the Board of Trade.An issue of considerable importance has arisen in oonnection with the Safeguarding of Industries Act, upon which I must ask for an early deoision of the Cabinet.The question is, whether the provisions of Part II of the Act (Prevention of Dumping due to Depreciation of Exchange) Bhould be applied to France, Belgium or Italy.In my opinion; there are strong reasons for refraining from applying the Act to any of these countries.   Such an application in the case of France is open to the following serious objections:-(l) It would add to the present state of tension between the two countries.(2) Although there is no Commercial treaty with France, we have for many yearB past secured by a French Tariff Law a minimum tariff, whioh is equivalent to most favoured nation treatment.   If we were to apply differential duties against French goods, there is little doubt that France would retaliate by withdrawing from us the advantage of tho minimum.tariff.   This would create a serious impediment to a large volume of British trade, and would far outweigh any temporary and sectional advantage which could be accorded to speoial industries under the Safeguarding of Industries Act.   we have, of course, no means of engaging in a tariff war, even were it desirable.SECRET. CP,126(23).
(3) We should be treating,France-differently from Italy and Belgium, with whom we have treaty arrangements which preclude the, immediate application to Italian or       197 Belgian goods of these provisions of the Act.With Italy we have a Commercial Treaty guaranteeing full most favoured.nation-treatment which, would require one year&apos;s notice bofore it could be denounced.   Belgium accords to us simidar//treatment by an Exchange of Notes, which Is terminable at three months&apos; notice.I am equally opposed to applying tho Act to Eelgium or Italy.   The general considerations which preclude action agains&apos;. France apply with hardly less foroe to Italy and Belgium, and in addition, as the oollapsod exchange provisions of the Aot expire in August, 1924, the period within which Orders oould be made would be too short to give any material advantage to British industries adversely affected.Hitherto it has been possible to avoid coming to grips with zhe main issue, as the evidence adduced in the past did not establish a good prima facie case of an exchange bounty. The fall which has taken place in the French and the Belgian exchanges has created a new situation;   and I do not think that I could refuse to order an inquiry on the ground of insufficient evidence of a bounty in cases in which a substantial increase of Imports at low prices has taken place-I have recently received an influential deputation from tho Nottingham Lace trade, supported by all the Nottingham Members of Parliament asking for an inquiry into the effects of French competition;   and I do not think that I.could reject it on the ground of insufficient evidence. This application will no doubt be followed by others. It would obviously be unfair to invite an industry to incur the trouble and expense of an inquiry if, notwith-standing a favourable finding by the Committee we were determined to refuse an Order on general grounds of policy.
Moreover, the mere granting of an inquiry would probably involve some of the international diiTi^nilbi-es which would follow from the making of an Order.The matter is therefore one of urgency and I think the Government ought to come to an immediate decision as to whether the Act is to be applied to Prance, Belgium and Italy,   Por the reasons I have given I am strongly of opinion that the Act ought not to be applied to any of these countries; and I suggest that I should be authorised to make a definite announcement to this effect.P, LL.-G,Board of Trade,24 th February, 192 S.
