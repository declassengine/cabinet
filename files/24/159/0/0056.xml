THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S COVEMaKNT.The Board of Trade Advisory Council, which contains representative men from the principal trades and Industries in the country, meets monthly.   At this meeting the members give the President in confidence a short appreciation of the conditions and prospects in their respective industries.It has been suggested to nie that my colleagues would be interested to see the views which they express.   I therefore attach a note taken at the last two monthly meetings.SECRET. CP.  156   (23)CABINET.-440Trade Prospects.Note by the President of the Board of Trade.(Intld.) P. Ll-G.Board of Trade.19th March, 1923.
I&quot; Trade Outlook.     The President, in inviting the Members of the CounoTi&quot;pfeaent to express their views with regard to the trade position now and in the near future, observed that it was important to be able to forecast as far as possible not only the progress of trade, but also how that progress would affeot the numbers of persons employed, as distinct from a diminution in the working of short time and an Increase in the efficiency of output and maohinery.Luring 1922 the volume of British exports increased at the average rate of about 20 per cent, per annum.   There were evidences of an expansion in the volume of home trade also, but no satisfactory measure of this growth was available.   If growth at the rate of about 5 per cent, in the year were assumed, the aggregate volume of production might be taken to have increased during the year by about ono-twelfth.   The numbers of insured workpeople were a olose approximation to the wage-earners in productive industry, since, though they included some sections of trade and transport, they excluded producers who are not wage-earners.   Thus the addition to the output oould be estimated as equivalent to the product of approximately 850*000 persons.The reduction in the numbers registered as unemployed, however, was only 340*000 in the year.   The difference should probably be aooountod for(a) By the making-up of short time,(b) By the increased efficiency of maohinery andlabour, and(c) To some extent through persons in uninsured tradesooming into insured trades.He invited an expression of the ^embers&apos; opinions as to(l) Whether a similar rate of progress both in export and home trade might be looked for in the present year,and(2) If so, to what extent this progress would be likely to be reflected in a diminution of short time on the one hand, and In the numbers of persons totally unemployed on the other.Sir Charles Addis (Chainnan of London Committee of Hong Kong and ilhanghaf BaSELng Corporation)) said that in the countries with which he was principally conoerned, namely, India and China, there were prospects of a slight improvement in trade, during the ooming year.   Political conditions in China had not settled themselves, and communications in %hat country were beingFEBRUARY MEETING OF THE BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.
thrown out of gear in consequence.   He was somewhat less sanguine than he had been as to the prospects of both China and India.   Both countries chose to balance their trade by Importing bullion;  13.,000,000 worth had thus boon imported into India during last year.    It would be a necessary preliminary stop to an improvement in our exports to those countries, that thoy should recognise that our goods are a more advantageous form of payment than precious metals0   He had heard of some sporadic improvements in orders placed in Manchester, and also to seme extent in Bradford.Mr. Baring (Banking: direotor of Baring Bros., &amp; Co., and of London Committee of Kong Kong and Shanghai Eanking Corporation) said he observed no material change.   Recent political events had been disturbing to the investing and trading public, but had been taken comparatively quietly in the City.   The state of the discount and money markets was such as to enable accommodation to be secured cheaply - more so than in the United states. He also observed a less demand for dollar credits.   The market for the principal raw materials was still rather against tho buyer, and the inference appeared to be that manufacturers and traders are still buying hand to mouth,   He agreed that there was a general impression that the progress mado in the last quarter of last year would be maintained.     There was a fairly good supply of commercial bills.The course of sterling exchange was satisfactory, and the prospect of the settlement of our debt to the United States was of first class importance and very encouraging to the City.Sir James Allon   (High Commissioner for New Zealand) considered that the general improvement in the trade of New Zealand would probably be maintained and improved.   Ke referred to the new Zealand government scheme for electrical development; this was designed to extend ovor a period of some 8 to 10 years, and it had been the original intention tc spend some  2,000,000 a year upon it, mainly in this country, but owing to economic and financial difficulties this figure had been cut down to  1,000,000 a year.   The Hew Zealand Government were anxious to do what they could to assist employment in this country, and for this prupose would probably be prepared to consider the possibility of speeding up development,   He desired to suggest that an endeavour should be made to come to some arrangement by which the New Zealand Government might secure-money at a cheap rate; this might help them in proceeding more rapidly with development schemes,   If these could bo aooelorated, increased openingsmight be oreatod for immigrants to How Zealand.He foresaw the difficulty, however, that the increased demand for electrical plant might result in a riso in its price, whioh might off-set the benefit of the cheaper money obtained.
The President replied that he would like to find an opportunity for discussing the matter as a whole with Sir James Allen.   As regards the possibility of a rise in prices, he did not think that prices would be likely to advance to any marked extent unless something in the nature of a. boom in the trade took place, and this appeared unlikely in the near future.:a Mr^linasag (Indian Trade Commissioner for the India Office) said that while Indian exports continued to increase   her imports were decreasing.   Re considered, however, that v-00k bottom had now been reached as regards the latter.   During recent months, the Indian trade balance had shown a favourable margin of eorae  3,500,000 par month.Hx  S (Chairman and Managing Dirootor of the General Electric Company Limited) stated that the group of electrical manufacturing companies in which ho was interested employed two. years ago some 19*500 people; subsequently they had had to reduce this figure to 11*200* the lowest point being reached during the period April to August of last yoar.   To-day, however, they were employing about 14*500 persons, and the improvement appeared to be a steady one, and due to increased purchasing capacity of people in this country.   The improvement in the home trade had started, before export business had arrived at its lowest level, whereas when tho deprossion first Bet in foreign business had continued aotive for some time after the home business had fallen off. This seemed to give some ground for the hope that a revival in foreign business might also be looked for in the near future, trade moving, as it were, in a   c-yole.   He noted an increase in enquiries from China, the Argentine, Australia and South Africa, though orders had not yet materialised, and thought that the prospects of a gradual improvement were hopeful.As regards the question raised by the President of the extent to which an improvement in trade might be reflected in diminution of unemployment as against diminution of short time working, Mr. Hirst said that in the lighter engineering in-dustry there was a more active diemand and fresh employment was being created; on the other hand, the heavy engineering in-dustry depended on the raising of considerable sums of money, and the big schemes which had been disciissed since the war had not yet developed.   If, however, any of these were proceeded with, he anticipated that, here also, new employment would be created as a result.Sir William Pearce (Chemicals: Director of Spencer Chapman and Messell, limited; Association of British Chemical Manufacturers and Federation of British Industries) noted a slow but steady improvement in the Chemical Industry, which was now perhaps being somewhat accelerated.   The consumption of sulphuric acid, which did -not amount to 70$ of the pre-war consumption, was, however, a rather disturbing feature.     There was a possibility that the difficulties in the Buhr and the Frankfurt districts might affect the German chemical industry, and if so, the dyes and chemical Industry in this country might be able to improve its position. The benefit of any improvement was mainly felt in the direction
of diminishing short time.MrcBrooke (Ministry of Transport) remarked that the latest published receipts for general merchandise traffic showed a slight hut steady upward tendency.   The latest statistics of actual carryings available wore those for last November; these showed that the total freight carried in that month was greater than   in any month since March 1920, though coal naturally formed a large proportion of this,,   The carryings of general merchandise for November 1922 showed an increase over those for November 1921 of about 8%,MroShaw (M,P, for Preston: Secretary of the International Congress olfTextile Workers: Vice-President Weavers&apos; Amalgamation) said that he was without up-to-date information as to conditions in the Cotton Trade, but that district reports1 he had seen two months ago showed that the tendency was towards the working of longer time together with a certain amount of new employment.Colonel Willey (Wool Textiles: Francis Willey &amp; Company, Bradford) considered that French action in the Ruhr was having an adverse effect upon the British woollen industry, aiid was discouraging employment in it0   Several mills bad been working on short time during the last few weeks; he anticipated increased difficulties in marketing wool,   At home, however, he considered an increase of business possible and looked for a slow improve-ment in the foreign market, but was under the impression that the Dominions which had benefited as a result of higher wool prices (New Zealand, Australia and South Africa) have now spent a good deal of their increased purchasing power? and the effects of the decreased purchasing power of Germany would make themselves felt.    The &quot;curve&quot; of employment would probably show a downward tendency.   Further importations from France were to be expected, since the internal value of the Franc did not appear to have decreased proportionately with the depreciation in its external value, and a bounty on export resultedc   A further result would probably be increased severity of French competition with us in other countries   The further depreciation of other European exchanges had also an adverse effect, and the situation of distributors was bad0   He considered that the peak had been reached last year, raw material imports having exceeded in quantity even the pre-war level.    In reply to a question by the President, Colonel Willey said he considered that exports were now being more adversely affected than the home consumption; the latter trade continued fairly steady.Sir Reginald Blankeriberg (Official Secretary to the High Commissioner for &apos;ihs Union or South Africa) thought that the position in South Africa was somewhat better, though the country was suffering, like our cwn, from unemploymento   Stocks were more absorbed, and various products such as mohair could now be sold to advantage.
Sir Glynn .West (Chairman of Armstrong Whitworth &amp; Company) said&quot; that&apos; sh.ipbuiToi.ng showed an improvement.   Enquiries were coming forward, and he thought that shipowners were realising (1) that some of the old ships are uneconomical to work, and (2) that tho internal combustion engine offers possibilities of greater economy.    There were a fey/ foreign orders and a few British orders, probably in roughly equal proportions, and he looked for a further improvement in the industry.   In general engineering, however, he could see no advance.   There was no improvement for instance in tool steel, which was a good barometer.   The demand for machine tools had also declined some-what.   He did not think that this was to be attributed to any great extent to the release of stocks in hand, such as those held by the Disposals Board, since these stocks now consisted mostly of machines of little use for general work.In the motor trade, so far as regarded non-commercial vehicles, he thought there was a distinct improvement and increased employment as compared with 1922, though it was difficult to say how far this was the result of work held up through the industrial disputes of that year.He noted an improvement in wire, wire-netting and wire rope making, and in ordinary commercial steel.    The Indian trade and foreign trade generally was good in these products, though there was little home demand.   There were rather more contracts coming forward for special machinery, but these were difficult to secure and difficult to finance.He was hopeful that there would be an improvement in the engineering trades during the next six or eight months; this would result chiefly in the taking on of new hands.As regards the possibility of an advance in prices to which Sir James Allen had referred, Sir Glynn West said that either some increase of prices or decrease in wages was very necessary for the trade.   There was, however, no likelihood of a boom of such magnitude as would result in a material advance in prices.Sir Percy Den sham Cbeatner: Chairman of the United Tanners&apos;1^ederatTon ) remarked that production in the leather trade was some 15$ higher now than twelve months ago, but no great increase of employment had resulted, for the reason, ho considered, that twelve months ago. the industry was supporting staffs from which it was not deriving full economic value. There had been a certain amount of unsottlcmont during the last three weeks as a result of events on the Continent.The replacement value of stocks was to-day considerably below selling prices.   The export trade was improving both in boots and heavy leather, and he was fairly confident of the prospects for the coming year;    during the past year such progress as had been made was in the home trade.
Mr. Evan Williams (President Mining Association of Groat Britain]ob&quot;servecttinat the most satisfactory feature of the coal situation was the increased home demand from the iron and steel industries.     The home market had for some time boen a weak feature, even while export trade was being regained. Tho present improvement in addition to having a beneficial effect on men already employed, was leading to the re-opening of some pits whioh had been closed down.The situation in tho Ruhr had led to some difficulties in the export trade;   thore had been.a good demand from Germany during last autumn, but this had now fallen off, although there was no difficulty in getting payment from German buyers at any time the seller desired.     An increased demand might have been expected from Franoe, but the fluctuations of the Prano exohange were causing hesitation on tho part of French buyers. Some classes of coal, however, were in demand:   the French railways were steady buyers, though mainly on long torm con-traota made before tho outbroak of the present disturbances. He understood that the French Government were making some arrangements to protect French buyers against the effects of the depreciation of the franc, and thought that possibly some good effect was resulting.The demand from the United States had fallen off., but there was a prospect of considerable shipments of coal from South Wales to Canada when the St. Lawrence opened.Anthracite was a comparatively bad feature;   a number .of pits were working short time and the demand had declined, porhaps as the result of the high prices askod for anthracite in the autumn.     The trade was, however, a seasonal one and might improve in May or June.The coal trade generally showed fairly steady employment. Men in employment were working on an average 5.6 days per week. It should be borne in mind that thore are more men in the industry now than in 1914;   Mr. Williams thought that there was practically no unemployment among those who legitimately belonged to it;    the unemployment was probably largely among outsiders who had been taken on during the war.The patent fuol Industry (located almost entirely In South Wales) was, however, experiencing bad times;   though there was increased consumption on the Continent, the British industry was unable to meet Belgian, French and German competition.     He attributed this, at any rate in part, to the scanty supply and high price of pitch, whioh now stood at 165/-per ton, as compared with 40/- per.ton before the war.     The trade normally employed some four to five thousand men of whom about throe thousand were now out of work.     The scarcity of pitch was partly duo^(l) to the lesser production of tar in this country, and (2) more especially to the greater use of tar on the roads;   this he considered to be a wasteful use of a valuable commodity.     It -was true that foreign competitors had to pay the same price for pitch as British manufacturers, but their standing charges and labour costs were less. It seemed desirable that a cheaper supply of pitch should be secured for tho home industry;    but he would not favour any form of Government control as a means to this end.
AS regards coal prices in general, Mr, Williams considered that no rise above the present level, was likely in the near future.Mr. Tait (Non-Ferrous Metals: Chairman of British Aluminium Company, TImTted and Director of British Metal Corporation, Limited) said that the aluminium industry had passed through its worst period between May 1921 and May 1922;    the group in which he was interested had found it necessary at that time to shut down their two works in Norway and to run the two in this country on half time.     Now, however, all four were again working full time;     there was a strong demand from the United States to meet the motor manufacturers&apos; increased programme for the ooming year; last year&apos;s output was about two and a quarter million cars, and this year the American makers counted upon turning out some three million.     Vie could,, in consequence, still sell aluminium to the United States in spite of the raising of the duty from 2 cents, to 5 cents, per lb.     Not much aluminium, however, was being supplied to Europe; the French market had always been closed to us by hi eh duties, and the demand from the remainder of Europe was met from Germany.     There was more employment in the rolling of aluminium sheets for the home market,     Mr. Tait thought it ought to be possible to increase production in this country;    an applica-tion was before the Trade Facilities Committee for assistance to construct large w,ater-power works at Lochaber; the construction of these would find employment for some three to four thousand men, and the works when completed would permanently employ about two thousand.     If left to themselves, however, the promoters would be disposed to defer this projeoteIn the non-ferrous metal trade generally there was a decided improvement.Mr. Holroyd (Cotton: Director of R. &amp; J, HPlroyd, Limited, Halifax:Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations and Federation of British industries) noted some improvement in the cotton trade during the past two months,.     In the spinning industry there was a- better demand for the finer counts^ and also for some of the coarse counts; the medium counts were, however, practically stagnant.      Progress would be much assisted if some stability in price and a larger supply of the raw material could be secured,,The same was largely true of weaving, where there was under-employment, but not much unemployment,,     As a result of a &quot;ballot which had recently been taken, short time working had not been made compulsory.Any improvement in the weaving section of the trade would mean the engaging of more men, but in the spinning section its effect would be felt in a reduction of short time working. j jMr. Shaw frCottonr Director off ftr-  Jt, Ilolr-oyd, . Lfmitofo *fialiflfliK&apos;i Federation of Master Cotton Spiniftoro1 Aooooiationo and&quot; &apos;tfodoanation edi1 BanitLohMlnduobnAoioV observed that it was rare for a spinning mill to stop work altogether;   it was from under-employment that this branch mainly suffered,,     If a settlement of the Turkish question were reached, increased exportation to the Near and Far East would probably result.Mr. Sanderson (Sanderson Murray and Elder Limited, Australasian Merchants, representing the High Commissioner for Australia on the   Advisory Council^) said that the repsrts-he had&apos; received from Australia were good; wool prices were keeping up and there was an improvement in mining.     Differences which had arisen       &apos;j.;Lji I^ ill - .&quot;7- ^      v If

The exchange position was still difficult., but its effects had not proved so bad as was anticipated,,,Sir James Allen   (High Commissioner for Hew Zealand) considered, that incTsased purchasing power in Hew Zealand resulting from trade during war time had been absorbed some time ago, but that the oountry was notf building up a fresh favourable balance j a natural increase of production was taking place, and old stocks had been liquidated,,

The President invited the Members of theCouncil present to express their views with regard to the trade position now and in the near future.Mr. Holroyd (Cotton: of R. and J.Holroyd,, Limited, Halifax, Federation of British Industries,and Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations) said that the situation in the cotton trade was even worse than before, especially in the American Section,   Though it might seem foolish to increase the price of an article already dear, manufacturers found that they had no option but to close the mills for a fortnight in March, thereby reducing the output of cotton yarns by 50%, and, if found necessary, this would be done again in April.   At present the mills were losing more than If they were closed down altogether; the world could not buy at present prices, which were largely governed by the price of raw cotton,The finest counts of Egyptian and Sea Island cotton were, however, doing better.   As regards the course of prices, this had again risen,, contrary to expectations; their future course depended on the American crop prospects for next season, and hitherto the weather had not so far been favourable for ground preparation.   High prices appeared inevitable during the present season; these might however have the effect of en-ecouraging planters for next season.     The United States was not exporting finished cotton products to any great extent, but was producing for her own consumption. jMr. Sutcliffe Smith (Textiles; Bradford Dyers&apos; Association), said that the Bradford trade in finished goods was better than at this time last year.   There were two adverse factors, viz, the fact that European exchanges were against us, and high prices,   Some cable enquiries were being received from China, but our prices were too high for them, and they were waitingifor them to drop.

There were two adverse factors, viz0 the fact that European exchanges were against us, and high prices,   Some cable enquiries were being received from China, but our prices were too high for them, and they were waiting for them to drop.   Competition was also being experienced in
French goods through the depression of the, franc, but not yet   &quot; to a serious extent.   French action was also occasioning some difficulties in regard to the export of goods to the Ruhr, both as regards transit and as a result of the 10$ export tax which the French were levying, on account of their inability to administer the Gorman customs tariff.The President said that if it were found that the 10$ tax represented a serious increase, the French had professed themselves willing to reconsider the figure. Traders who were experiencing difficulties should report them to the Board of Trade.   He mentioned that, with a view to facilitating tho exportation from the territory occupied under the Rhineland Agreement of goods which firms in allied countries had agreed to purchase.under contracts dated before January 25th, it has beon decided that during the next 3 months, all genuine oases of hardship resulting from the new export regime may be settled on the following lines;(l) The purchasing firm in the country of destination may itself apply to the Licence Office at Bad Ems for the issue of an export licence, or if an Ems licence was issued before January 25th, may apply for suoh licence to be stamped, in recognition of its validity.&quot; (2) Goods in respect of which the licence formalities have been complied with may be exported on payment of the export duty in force when the purchase contract was signed, instead of the new export duty of 10 per cent.(3) The firm in the Allied country which is to receive the goods will be exempt from the obligation to deposit a proportion of the purchase price, in the form of foreign valuta, with a Bank in the Occupied Territory.British traders who desired to take advantage of the above arrangements should forward full particulars of the goods, name and address of tho supplier,and dates of the orders to
the British High-Commissioner, Inter--All!- d Rhineland High -ommlsslon, Cohlenz.It was expected that the authorities in the Ruhr district would adopt similar measures, but their decision had not yet been given.Sir Frederick Lewis (Shipping: chairman of Furness Withy and Company) said that the shipping situation had never been worse than now, except as regards shipments of coal, in which small vessels, and colliers were doing profitable business.   There was not sufficient freight in the world for the industry to make money on, and the prospects of an improvement which had been looked forward to three months ago had faded away.   Shipbuilding also was slack; his company had found that the price for building certain ships was 25% to sofo more than they had expected.   This was doubtless due, at any rate in part, to the high price of steel,Mr, Murray (-Commerce: iessrs, Ker Bolton and Company, Glasgow, East India Merchants) said that, the considerable demand from the Far East for textiles which had shown itself In January had now declined, largely on account of the financial position in those markets.    There might, however, be an Improvement on account of the better price which the countries concerned were obtaining for their produce, especially sugar1.   In. regard to the chief articles which we export to them, such as   textiles, Far Eastern buyers were still holding off because they considered our prices too high, but they would be bound to buy when they realise that a fall in prices is impossible, since the stocks which they were holding were light.   Competition from Japan and the United States was not so severe as it was a year previously., as a result of .a rise . ini costs in those countries.   On.the whole he considered the -prospects in the Far East not depressings they could afford to buy, though not In very large quantities, but in a few months it seemed
likely that their purchasing power would be greater.     He thought it possible that the revival of demand might come in tho first instance from China, though it was true that stocks were being accumulated there in the ports to some extent, through the disorganisation of the country. Japanese competition was experienced by our merchants more in Java than elsewhere, but was not now so keen as formerly.u-Shirley.Bern (President, Association of British Chambers of Commerce) said that he was without first-hand information, but a general impression was cur-rent that a decided improvement had taken place, though this might not be lasting.     He thought that on the whole no material set-back had been caused by the European situation.Mr. Sanderson (of Sanderson Murray and Elder, Limited, Australasian merchants, representing the High Commissioner for Australia on the Advisory Council) said that favourable balanoes were accumulating in Australia, except in the fruit and meat industries.     Wool sales, it was true, had shown a slight weakness during the previous day or two, but this &apos;would not materially affect Australian wool growers as they had already largely disposed of their wool.     The position in general was steady and sound.Colonel Willey (Wool Textiles;   of Francis Willey and Company, Bradford) said that the general apprehension which had been shown in February was now more marked;   there was increased unemployment in Yorkshire, though he was not prepared to say whether this was due to events in the Ruhr. Orders from all over the world were less than in January, and a tendency was boing shown for more machinery to go on short time,,      Spinners and combors, who were well employed last year, especially with the European demand, had experienced a set-back during the last few weeks and were
working short time.   A decrease in purchases of hosiery was also being felt in Leicester.There were general misgivings as to the effects of French action in Germany destroying confidence throughout Europe.   The effects of French offerings in other markets and of importation of French yarns into this country were also being felt.   This would probably continue until the franc suffered a set back in its internal value, thereby stimulating French internal demand and curtailing export.   At present the French textile industry was working at about 130$ of normal production and employing both day and night shiftsi their costs were proportionately reduced, and they were taking all orders at sight,   We were feeling their competition in all branches of tho woollen trade, and not only in those which were a French speciality. In the case of the similar German competition resulting from depreciated currency, some assistance in meeting this had been furnished by the 26$ reparation payment- but there was no such check on the French competition.   He observed that the German Government were beginning to pay the 26$ in respect of the reparation payment to their nationals in sterling, and raised a question as to the legality of thisj but at the same time recognised that one effect would be to stimulate German capacity to buyaThe most dangerous competition, however, came from France, and was affecting our distant markets overseas0 In answer to a question by the President,&apos; Colc Willey said that our exports had not yet fallen off as a result to a very serious extent, but in an adverse market small factors, such as uncertainty as to prices, had a disproportionate effect. He estimated the capacity of the French wool textile industry at about 55$ to 60$ of ours.The British indt\stry found that orders were not coming forward from Chili, Brazil, South Africa and other markets which \isually carry on a brisk general trade with Germany5 being now
unable to sell to Germany, their purchasing power was reduced. In the ordinary course, if Prance consumed her home-made textiles only a small balanoe was left for export.Mr. Lindsay (Indian Trade Commissioner, representing the India Office on the Council) said that while Indian exports were maintained, the favourable balanoe of  3,000,000 in December last had fallen to about  500,000 in January, this being due to an increase in the price, but not the volume,of imports.   There had, however, been an increase in the importa-tion of sugar, and he looked for an increase in imports of iron, steel and ooal.   It was to be expected that the trade balance would shortly turn against India, on account of the increase in the price of her staple requirements.   The price of wheat in India had at the same time fallen.   The Government of India had estimated Its home charges for this year (such as interest on debt, purohase of railway stores, otc.) at  27,000,000, and to meet this a favourable balance of from  2,000,000 to  2,500,000 per month would be necessary, but it now seemed possible that this expectation might not be realised In answer to a question by the President, Mr. Lindsay explained that the figures of importation did not include Government purchases.Sir William Pearoe (Ohoiaioalst Association of British Chemical Manufacturers-, Director of Spencer Chapman and Messell Limited, and Member of the Council of the Federation of British Industries) said that thore was still a certain improvement in the chemical industry.   The dye and fine chemical manufacturers considered their prospects were improving as a result, at any rate partly, of events in the Ruhr, and pointed out that if the industry had not by now been to some extant established bore, ourtextile manufacturers, would be finding themselves in difficulties.   It was thought that the Dyoetuffs Act and the Safeguarding of Industries Act has, therefore, justified     themselves     in    this     particular.
Sir william Pearce also observed, that there was still a noticeably cheerful atmosphere in general merchanting business, no set back in volume having occurred, and that conditions were regarded, as distinctly better than last year.Mr - Moore (West African Merchant) said that the Liverpool general produce market, where a rise in values had occurred, was in better heart, except as regards the grain and cotton sections.   There was an active demand from Germany, payments being offered in sterling.     Competition from the German Woermann line had recommenced;   that line was paying in marks, while receiving in sterling. -Increases in value of its produce had favourably affected the purchasing power of West Africa, and stocks of British imports out there had been reduced and brought down to present day prices.Mr. Baring (Banking director of Baring Bros, and Co., and of London Committee of Hong-Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation) noted that there was still a good demand, for fi financial accommodation, partly perhaps owing to the lowness of discount rates, but the fact should also probably be taken as indicating a considerable volume of trade.   Essential commodities showed a tendency to.rise in price.   The. placing of the Austrian Treasury Bonds gave a certain measure of hope for the rehabilitation of that country.     As regards the French exchange, this had deteriorated, but he could not prophesy as to its future course; , probably there was a good deal of buying of francs on Government account.   In the absence of Government support, he thought that there might be some fear of a &quot;flight from the franc&quot;, but would hesitate to make a prediction:   France had considerable Interests in investments outside her own country, and a certain amount of realisation of sterling securities by the French was taking place.
Mr . Arthur. Wats on, (General Manager, London, Midland an%? &quot; Scottish Railway Company) sent a letter eorrtainlng the fald^wing-remarks in regard to the Trade Cutdook:-&quot;The figures relating to Railway traffic indicate that there was an improvement in the position of the trade of the country during January 1923, as compared with January 1922, and on the whole trade was slightly better than at the end of December 1922 .&quot;As regards Merchandise Traffic, assuming the figures for the late London &amp; Northern Western Railway for 4 weeks ended 28th January are typical of-the Railway position of the country as a whole, the net tonnage hauled (exclusive of live stock) for the particular section of Railway mentioned, showed an increase compared with the corresponding period in 1922, of roughly 20$.
