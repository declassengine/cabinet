H   8THE UlEMPLOYED.............................     &quot;   irish REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN GREATBRITAIN................................     &quot; 10SUMMARYOn March 12th the wholly unemployed on the live registers totalled approximately 1,302,600, a decrease of 16,155 on the preceding week:   on the same date the number working short time and drawing benefit for intervals of unemployment was 55,300 as compared with 53,847 on March 5th.The unrest among trade-unionists which has begun to take tangible form in several industries must be attributed, in part, to communist propaganda:   the secret documents quoted on pages &apos;i, 5 &amp; 6 of this* report are proof of the interest taken by Moscow in the industrial situation in Great Britain.Practically the whole of &quot;The workers1 Weekly&quot; of March 24th is devoted to industrial matters :   &quot;From the Miners&apos; Battle front&quot;;   &quot;Builders Ready for Action&quot;;    &quot;Slavery of P.C.5.&quot;; &quot;Farm Workers Misery - 18/- a Week Threat&quot; are some of the headings used.J.T. Walton Nowbold attended the Factory Councils&apos; Congress I in Frankfurt on M^rch 18rh:   he was invited to attend by Radek * -o Bukharin, .The Communist Party has distributed very large quantities of its &quot;Open Letter to the Rank and File of the Labour Party&quot; but their-effect cannot yet be estimated.Th  Central Committee of the Communist Ptrty has instructed ^11 groups to start a &quot;Hands Off Ireland&quot; movement and to make wie recent deportations the subject at all meetings next week-end.
MB oommuiists 494IK is reliably reported that all members of the Executive Gommittee of the Communist Party of Great Britain have been invited to visit Moscow in order to meet the Executive of the Comintern:     this step is being taken because Moscow considers that the present state of the Communist Party of Great Britain is unsatisfactory and that the Executive lacks a clearly defined policy and is divided by personal quarrels:   it is thought that MacManus, who is at present in Russia, has made a full statement with regard to the Party.     Hewbold has said that he was closely questioned when In Moscow by radek and Bukharin regarding the personal animosities of the British&apos;Executive.Uewbold is reported to have been in Germany last week-end In company with Gallacher in order to consider what steps could be taken by the communists against the French policy in the Ruhr:   Hewbold hoped to meet Radek there.The Communist Party&apos;s leaflet an &quot;Open letter to the Sank and File of the labour Party&quot; appears to have been distributed in very large quantities.   The following are the available figures:-Manchester DistrictParty Committee.............      10,000 copiesGlasgow DistrictParty Committee...............      10,000      &quot;Birmingham Districtparty Committee..............        5,000      &quot;Leicester...................       1,000      *In the instructions accompanying the leaflets officials were informed that:&quot;If you refer to our circular you will see that it is our desire that all local Party Committees should send a copy of leaflet with letter (draft of which was included in circular) to each Trade Union Branch or District Committee, Trades Council, Co-operative yociety, and such other bodies as may be affiliated to the LabourParty/
m    2   &quot;Party.    District Party Committees are asked to see that all Local Party Committees get proper supplies. At the same time, every effort should be made, and opportunity taken to distribute this &quot;Open Letter&quot; at Branch and District meetings of Trade Unions, Independent Labour Party, Co-operatives, etc.     Special comrades should be put on this job.   A good plan would be a judicious distribution at work gates during $inner hour where the workers-are more likely to give them the proper attention.     In this connection some comrades who may be unemployed should be found for this work.   The prime consideration is to get this &quot;Open Letter&quot; into the hands of all workers belonging to organisations affiliated to the Labour party,&quot;The following reply to &quot;a special emergency questionnaire&quot; sent out by Cant on March 1st illustrates the efforts being made by communists to capture the Labour Party machinery:&quot;Special Emergency Questionnaire^. -:-1,     Which, if any, of the Local labour parties in your area are prepared to accept communists as individual members?Kingston Individual Section &amp; Trades &amp; Labour Council.

Sec. of Richmond T. h L.C*is a C.P. member.&quot;Cook, the communist Porth Miners&apos; Agent, is in close touch with the Liverpool district organiser of theCommunist/
Communist Party who has suggested that a few extremist miners from South Wales should he drafted into Lancashire &quot;in order to consolidate the fighting elements which are undoubtedly in existence there&quot;.     The communists are of opinion that if a &quot;definite stand&quot; can be made in one important industry &quot;it would give the necessary spirit to all other sections of organised workers,&quot;Philip Hodge, the leader of the Fifeshire Mine Workers&apos; Reform Union is also in direct touch with Cook and there seems little doubt that the Communist plans for putting unrest in various important industries on a national basis are making some headway.It is reported that the Paisley Trades and Labour Council is now dominated by communists and that the Glasgow branches of the Woodworkers&apos; Union are also under communist control:   the latter are said to have drawn -up a secret policy to the effect that if communists are expelled from the Trades Council, they will with-hold the political funds of their union from the Labour Party.The communists are making special efforts to exploit the dispute in the juta industry in Dundee and will try to send. Gallaeher there this week for propaganda purposes: G-allacher was previously sent to lifeshire in order to consolidate the rebel element among the minors in the communist interest.The Liverpool District party Committee is considering the possibility of amalgamating St. Helens, ligan, Earlestown and neighbouring places with a view so their being constituted another District Party Area,The Communist Party is drawing up a manifesto on the question of the Irish deportations and intends to hold a series of &quot;protest&quot; meetings.     Scottish communists have been instructed/
instructed &quot;to get into close touch with the Republican elements.&quot;On the other hand at a meeting of the London Group Leaders of the Communist party last week, J.Wilson brought a verbal warning from King Street to the effect that no member must help, or converse in public with any known member of the Self Determination League.It is reported, on the authority of a single informant that Alex. GedSes has been expelled from the greenock group of the Communist Party:   he was formerly one of the organisers of the underground department.m $ED IOTBRMAIIOHAL OP LABOUR UHIONSThe part played by Moscow in labour troubles in this country through the media of the communist and Red International of Labour Unions organisations has been so often stressed in these reports as to have become, possibly, commonplace:    but in view of the unrest now obtaining inI     at least six important industries it would be difficultj      to exaggerate the significance of the very secret     documents quoted below:1(1)   Letter from Kalinin, secretary to tho Presidium of the Profintern, to the British Bureau of the Red International of Labour Unions dated Moscow,. BirchI 5th, 1923.&quot;Your letter of Feb. 6, including financial lj report on hand*   In the future kindly send usII regularly two,reports per month:   it is desirableI that the policies and work of the R.I.L.U., especiallyin the campaigns in which the Bureau participatesi together with other organisations, be described in greater detail.] &quot;It is requested that you furnish detailed information as soon as possible particularly on the following questions;I (a) &quot;What do the Port Bureaux in England represent?1 Are they minority organisations or similar to theOne Big Union?   In short, describe fully the aims and/
and objeots of the port Bureaux, their organisational structure and relations with the Amsterdam Unions and other- organisations:. What is the cause of the existence ox so many Port Bureaux in England? The Exeotvta Bureau had in mind the -organisation of one or two Bureaux only. When did Hardy leave for America?(b) &quot;Describe more fully &amp;nd precisely your relations with the leaders of the Chicn of Building and Transport Workers.   Tell us more about Comrade Hicks,&apos;, his political views and attitude towards the E. I.B.U.(c) &quot;Describe in detail the ptiike movement among the coal miners of ;-;civ!;h VOeb.    Believing that you understand the iv.ll tie iiot.fr tees of the situation and that you will decide rq-,o-;. cepavste activity only in special cases and under asvcui-sble conditions, -advise us of the attitude of Hodges and Co. and of the real prospects in this struggle.&quot;As regards your misunderstandings with the Executive Committee of the Communist Party, we shall do everything possible to have the Comintern issue proper instructions. We wish to point out, however, that it is not particularly necessary to have an official representative of our Bureau in the E.C. of the Communist Party.   You must work in close contact with the local Communist organisations;   but this can be done without official representation of both organisations in the Executive Committees.    At any rate, it is not worth while raising an official scandal over the non-admission of Comrade lismer to the meetings of the Executive Committee.&quot;We fully approve of your policy towards the movement of the building workers.   We have given corresponding instructions to the International Propaganda Committee to start a correspondence with Comrade Hicks.   cope.es of these letters will be forwarded to you through the Bureau.&quot;We consider the delay in the printing of the resolutions and decisions of the Second Congress of the Bed International of labour Unions as extremely pulling. Your claims that the printers are afraid to print them do not hold water.     As long as you have the means and have been charged with their publication, you should have found other printing shops, and other printers to print these resolutions in time.    It is requested that you have the resolutions and decisions of the Second. Congress of the E.I.L.U. published and forwarded tc all the English speaking countries without delay and at any prioe.&quot;You will have to arrange financial questions with Comrade Losovsky who is now In Berlin.   Get in touch with him through the Mid-European Bureau.&quot;Pay a.ue attention to the timely supply of Moscow with newspapers and proper information on the labour movement of England, Australia ar.u South Africa.- All expenses will be covered by the Mid-European Bureau which received corresponding instructions from us.&quot;
(2) letter from Reinhardt, secretary of the Mid-EuropeanBureau, of tho Red International of Labour Unions, toS.O. Davies; Miners1 Agent in Dowlais, dated Berlin,March 10th; 1923.&quot;In view of the unrest which is prevailing at this moment among the miners of all cj^r/Gries and in order to co-ordinate their struggle iiri^ruationally it is of utmost Importance for us to be well informed concerning the different organisations.&quot;We would therefore be very thankful if you could send us as soon as possible one or several copies of the rules and regulations and other material of your English miners federations.&quot;(3) Letter from Kalinin to Harry Pollitt dated Moscow, Maroh 5th, 1925.&quot;Yours of February 15. on hand.   We greatly regret that you cannot devote all your time to work of the London Bureau of the R.I.L.U.   You realise, of course, that it is of tremendous importance to the R.I.L.U. and to the entire revolutionary labour movement of England that you actively engage in the Bureau work.   We therefore still hope that you, an old trade union worker knowing well the labour movement of England, and having great authority in the Communist Party, will give our Bureau all the attention you can possibly afford,&quot;The work of the Bureau grows considerably.   Along with the movement of transport workers there are things brewing among the coal miners of south Wales.   &quot;The unemployed movement ie also still of considerable importance. Even leaving out the necessity of organising minorities in the local trade unions and of developing our propaganda work.   It Is necessary to pay particular attention to the support and co-ordination of our work with the revolutionary activities of the workers of Central Europe, America and other countries.   All this requires close attention to the questions arising in the International labour movement.   It requires close co-operation between the Communist and trade union movements.   The least misunderstanding at the present time would be fatal to the labour movement of both England and other countries.&quot;We are therefore convinced that you will continue as of old to be a most active worker of the R.I.L.U. and will do everything possible to settle the various patty troubles between the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain and the R.I.L.U. Bureau and see that they do not recur. &apos; *&quot;Kindly advise us more frequently of your work and of the situation in the British labour movement.&quot;According/
According to the Mid-European Bureau of the RedInternational of labour Unions the international conference which was to have been held at Cologne on March 17th was pro-hibited by &quot;the English authorities on French initiative&quot; but the bureau stated that the conference would take place &quot;if notin Cologne then somewhere else&quot;.   In this connection NatWatkins has Informed the Mid-European Bureau;&quot;In reply to the communication from Comrades Radek and Bucharin, requesting that Comrades Tom Mann and J.T. Walton Hewbold attend the Conference of the Factory Committee on the Ruhr, I enclose letter from Comrade Tom Mann regretting his inability to be present, owing to the arrangements previously made whioh he feels it hie duty to fulfil.&quot;We deeply regret that we are unable to be represented at Buch an important gathering, and trust that our heartiest greetings will be conveyed to the victims of capitalist domination, as manifested in the Ruhr, Italy and France.&quot;I have forwarded yesterday the copy of a Resolution passed at the Anthracite Distriot of the South Wales Coalfield, sending Greetings to our comrades and expressing their regret at being unable to be present at the conference.&quot;Tom Mann gives the following reason for his Inability togo to Germany:&quot;I regret I am not able to comply with request to be at Factory Councils Congress;before leaving England for South Africa I had fixed up a series of meetings in Co. Durham amongst the miners, these I had to efcncel, the meetings are again fixed and I st**rt them on the 18th inet,, and it would be disastrous to interfere with them from the propagandist standpoint.   Under these circumstances I beg to be excused.&quot;Nat Watkins has made an interesting statement upon therelations between the Red International of Labour unions and the unemployed in the 0ourse of which he says that:-&quot;There is great advantage to be derived from Unemployed . affiliation but if possible it should be on a National Scale and not local, our responsibilities towards the Unemployed are constantly brought before us by the International, reminding ue that we should give direction to every premeditated move of the Unemployed, and gradually draw them more and more to the adoption of pur view, and further the application of policy to the situation confronting them.&quot;George/
George Hardy has returned to America and was in Chicago on Maroh 6th.THE YOUNG COMMUNIST LEAGUEThe Berlin Bureau has sent a quantity of &quot;Bulletin for Teachers of Communist Ghildren&apos;s Seotions&quot; to this country: this is a new publication the first issue of whioh called for no comment.Charles Redfern, the national secretary of the Young Communist League, has left this oountry by the underground route I       and is believed to be at present in Berlin:   it is doubtful I       whether his reception by the Berlin Bureau will be all that he could desire as one of the other League officials has sent a far from flattering report ahead of him in the course of whioh he says:&quot;Ho,(i.e. Redfern,!has wasted a whole day arguing with me that its quite in order for a Y.C. to get drunk as often as he likes;   he is trying to Justify the fact that he has been blind drunk for the last six nights out of ton.   Ho actually told me when I told him what I would do with him if I had the opportunity (shoot him) that the Rues* Revolution was &quot;built 6n vodkarand that I was :narrow-minded&apos; and talked like a &quot;capitalist politician&apos; whatever that&apos;B got to do with it.   I said that&apos;s the kind of rewards I expeot from a boozefighter.&quot;How did all this come about (?). First of all, about two weeks ago or maybe more we noticed c.R. and. J.M.fMoylan) disappearing together nightly.&quot;Shortly after this C*R. presents himself at the Offioe with his face kicked out of shape and we afterwards discover that the night or rather early morning before, he was engaged in a drunken brawl in a notorious West End club and that Moylan was sick four times in a tram on the same occasion, this is with important L. documents in his possession...&quot;About this time he turns up to the office at about 1-2 o&apos;clock and plays on a tin-whistle that ho&quot;s constantly playing with and goes home about 5-6      doing nothing -just nothing, that is excepting meeting nights, on the last three of which he has regularly asked why I have not completed the programme, when he makes the office impossible to work in by childish and ridiculous horse-play and playing his tin-whistle...&quot;The next morning I arrived rather late, to find In the inner office,     R. and another booze-fighter fromTooting/
Tooting, they were indulging in the sky-larkiag about, one expects from the type.&quot;After a while, the noise increased and one or two other comrades came along or were encouraged into this merry land.   When about five of them were present, after indulging in amateur boxing and wrestling matches and breaking office furniture, they got whistles, combs and paper and the Roneo cover, end. decided to run a Jazz Bandy which was undoubtedly a great success, it was the Jazziest band I have ever listened to, after about five minutes I gave up work as hopeless, one could not hear onebelf speak, and as I could not throw them out single-handed and did not care to fetch in the police (though I seriously considered it) I took a walk for two hours or so, only to come back and find it still in progress, and it was kept going till about 4 in the afternoon.,.&quot;UNEMPLOYEDDhe London officials of the national Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement are occupied in preparations for the forthcoming national conference at Coventry and have consequently devoted less attention to demonstrations during the past week.Plane are being made for a march of unemployed from Glasgow to Edinburgh next week:   the contingents are flue to reach Edinburgh in time for a demonstration at 12 noon on March 28th:   information regarding the numbers likely to participate in the march are not yet available but 10 men expect to go from Alloa, in charge of John Guthrie, 15, Eorthbank Square, and 10 from the North West Glasgow branch, in charge of Hugh Mclochlan, 4, Oakhahk St., Glasgow.The Scottish South Western District Council of the National Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement, is very short of money and is urging all affiliated committees to support the Maintenance Fund.The Chief Constable informs me that there is a recrudescence of activity among the Birmingham unemployed, especially on the Smethwick boundary,William/
William Brain recently applied for out-relief in respect of himself, his wife and family, but was informed by the officials that they were prepared to find him work on the Corporation scheme at Wsrley Park.   Br^in said he could not accept this offer as it would be &quot;blaoklegging&quot; since the rate of pay was not recognised by the trade union:   the officials informed him that if he wore not satisfied he could only be offered the workhouse.SH HB TOuUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN GREAT BRITAINThe deportation of the Republican leaders has had a good effect inasmuch as it has thrown their organisation out of gear at a very oritioal moment:   for months past they have been gathering together their forces so as to put their full weight behind the blow to be struck against the Free State this Spring:   prominent Republicans in Ireland admit that it is now or never with the Republic and say that all will be over by June next.Except for a few fanatics, there seems to be a great reluctance on the part of those remaining behind to throw themselves into the breach:   even in Scotland, where they are numerous and powerful, the leaders are taking refuge in anonymity.With regard to the moderate Irieh section it may be said that although the deportations came as a great surprise to them, most of them are now astonished, having regard to the growing arrogance and increased activity of the Eepv.bli.oan agents and their supporters in this country, that they were so long deferred.A small section of the labour Party, headed by Mr. Dumiioo, M.-P, who has always been in close touch with Art 0&apos;Brian is raising a Dafence Fund and circularising thefriends/
frienfiB and relations of the Deportees.In London no meeting of importance took plaog during the week and the movement appears to be more or less at a standstill.On March 18th a meeting under the auspices of the v/est Ham Trades Council ana central Labour party was held at the Public Hall, Canning town.     There were only about 200 present although the Hall holds 2,000.   Except for a statement by Mr. Will Thorne, M.P., hat the Labour Parxy intends to hold protest meetings all over the country nothing of interest was said.     A collection in: aid of the Bind only realised thirteen shillings and five pence.In Huiehc-ioter the Countess M;..rkieviea addressed a meeting at the Hulrae To-vn Hall on Mc.rch 14th and said that, in spite of the fact that their leaders had been taken away from them just at a vital moment, she wanted them to realise that it was not only the leaders that counted.   The British Government had shown its fear of the Irish Republicans by carrying off their leaders in this dramatic fashion:   she supposed she must consider herself lucky to have escaped and wound up by making an appeal for funds as they were nearer their goal than ever.   The audience of about 400, with&apos; a considerable sprinkling of English working people, was very subdued and orderly and there was a marked lack of applause.In Liverpool, a special meeting of the Irish Self-Do termination league was held at 93, Scotland Read on March 14th to elect officers to replace lihose deported, but- owing to the small attendance, no decision was reached,In Glasgow wn emergency meeting of the Republican Organisation was held on March 13th in a hall in Ingram Street, sad a small committee appointed to replace the deportee! leaders:   Liam Travers has been appointed to act as Organiserpro./
-is- 50pro. tern, with Jamos Boston *g Secretary, and Mrs. Hutohinson (whone husband was deported) as Treasurer.The Republican Journal &quot;Eire&quot; is still being printed ana published in Glasgow:   its managers, ?.J. little and George Humphreys, who escaped the round-up, are lying very low to avoid arrest:   a noticeable feature in this week&apos;s edition is an attack on Thomas Johnstons tho Irish labour leader, who is described as &quot;having a weakness for England.&quot;      The &quot;Workers1 Republic&quot; or organ of the Irish Communists, also attacks Johnstons and his labour colleagues this week.On March 15th Customs Officials seized 142 German automatic pistols of the &quot;peter the Painter&quot; type, with 4,642 rounds of ammunition for same, on board the s.s. &quot;Glenapp1 when that vessel arrived in the Thames from Antwerp:   Woo Kong Dai, a Chinese steward, wae arrested and convicted for having brought them into this country and was ordered to pay a fine of  365. 2. 0. or to be imprisoned for 91 days.   He said the arms were for China but this is very doubtful:   they mere found in a most accessible place end would probably have been landed here for transhipment to Ireland:   this class of pistol is much sought after by rebels as it is capable of being converted into a rifle.
