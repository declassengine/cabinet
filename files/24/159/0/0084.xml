MEMORANDUM OH THE REPORT OP THE, AGRICULTURAL TRIBUNAL.   U fc(The numbers refer,.to the paragraphs in the Report).17,  Farm Institutes.    The movement for the provision of farm institutes is practically Suspended not so much from lack of funds as from the unwillingness of tho Counties to incur any additional expenditure from the Rates.Under the Farm Institutes Scheme the Ministry provide three-quarters of the capital expenditure incurred in buildings and equipment and engage to meet two-thirds i&amp;f the annual deficit on working.15 of these Institutes are now in operation including 3 not aided by the Ministry.   Expenditure on farm institutes out of the  850,000 was strongly opposed by the representatives of the National Farmers1 Union and the provisional allocation for that purpose was eventually reduced to  75,000, of which  45,000 is already allocated for four further Institutes,   It is probable that two more farm institutes may be started out of the balance, making 21 in all.It is doubtful whether it would be desirable to press for the setting up of further residential farm institutes in the immediate future as it seems likely that in many Counties better results may be obtained by an extended organisation of regular classes at certain centres in the County without any large expenditure either upon buildings or farms.19.   Agricultural Organisers.    The Tribunal speak highly of the work of the Agricultural Organisers, with which we are in entire agreement.   They recommend that the organisers should be attached to the Provincial Agricultural Colleges and form part of their Staff. This question was very carefully considered at the close of the War when the reorganisation of the system of Agricultural Education was taken in hand.   The Ministry had then before it the recommendation of Lord Selbome&apos;s Committee to the same effect, l.e. that the administration of local instruction should be taken out of the hands of the County Councils.   There are
certain obvious advantages to be gained by such a course, particularly that the purely Rural Counties.who are most in need of agricultural education are usually the moat disinclined to take any steps1 in this direction.   Por example Norfolk declines to appoint an brganiser or to spend any appreciable sum of money upon agricultural education.The disadvantages attaching to such a step are that the whole of the expenditure would haVe to be borne by the Ministry, and again that It is doubtful whether adequate supervision of the work in the Counties could be obtained if the administration were in the hands either of the Colleges or of the -Ministry.   The most weighty objection to displacing the Counties was, however, the fact that they are the authorities for education in general in their areas and have been engaged Upon agricultural education since 1890.   Many of them, especially the more wealthy semi-urban Counties, have built up a considerable and fairly adequate organisation.   Despite the advantages which a centralised scheme would seem to offer in uniformity, economy and concentration of effort on the localities most needing the work, it was felt to be impossible at that late date to reverse the principle Of local autonomy and local responsibility for a portion of the expenditure.In its anxiety to secure the appointment of agricultural organisers the Ministry did, however, undertake to pay four-fifths of the salary of these officers.   In order to secure as much collaboration as possible between the Counties and the Organisers regular meetings are now held at the College centres between the Organisers, the Advisers and the regular College Staff, whereby It is hoped a considerable measure of common effort will eventually be obtained.   In some&apos;cases, as in Wales, the Organisers are made. Honorary Members of the Staff of the Colleges, and the Ministry is prepared to press the Colleges in England to extend the same measure of recognition to the organisers within their area.
It is not considered practicable &quot;to displace---County . Council responsibility for local agricultural education but Ixrttei work is likely to follow the development of the system of meetings of the instructors, organisers, etc.   engaged in each College area.21.   Agricultural Research.     It is agreed that there Is an opening for further economic research into improved systems of farming.   The Ministry have already made some experiments in this direction, e.g0 the Experimental Farm at Methwold dealing with the reclamation and management of very light land;   the Arable Dairy Farms at Denham, Hucknall and Resparveth, the Lactose Factory near Crowe.   The experience of the Ministry has, however, notbeaivery happy In   these ventures.   They were unfortunate in that they were all   started at the time of very high costs for building, equipment etc. some three years ago, but they further have suffered and must inevitably suffer in that they have to be conducted b?,r a Government Department under Treasury regulations.It is without doubt desirable that further experiments in this direction should be undertaken, e0g. an arable stock farm, in which the land Is kept under the plough almost exclusively for the growth of fodder crops rather than corn, a farm worked on a rotation based,on ensilage, a tobacco growing farm on the light lands of Norfolk or Suffolk etc.   It is considered essential however, that all ventures of this type should be out of the hands of the Ministry and conducted by an ad hoc body analogous to a Public Utility Company.   The body in question would consist of a committee with a head executive officer selected for his administrative and business capacity.   It would be charged with the conduct of all agricultural experiments of a commercial nature and it would be supplied with the capital required for each venture from the Development Commission after approval by the Ministry.To such an institute could also be entrusted the commercial development of discoveries made at the other Research
Institutes, e,g. the manufacture of artificial fann-yard manurefrom straw, a process which has heen worked out at Kothamstedup to the point of commercial developments.     Again no satisfactory method has yet heen evolved for the commercial development ofpatents which may from time&apos; to time he taken out as a result of investigations at the Research Institutes, and work of this kind could well he entrusted to the proposed body,Considerable capital funds will doubtless be requiredby the body sketched, but the greater part, if not the Whole ofit, should he recoverable and the ultimate expenditure should notbe great. and 25 Credit.&quot;&quot;-&apos; The Economists suggest, in addition to the CreditCommittee^ proposals, that credit should be given:-(a) for the erection of buildings and plant for such purposes as co-operative creameries and(b) to finance agricultural co-operative trading societies.$&quot;here is no special objection to the flrBt suggestion, which is also referred to in the note on paragraph 33, but the second suggestion would be vigorously opposed by the private traders on the ground that it would enable co-oi^erative societies to compete more effectively against them.    Further, Kr. F.D. Acland, the Chairman of the Agricultural Organisation Society, has recently expressed the opinion that most of their societies have already got as much credit as is good for them.It may be added that the real difficulty of getting co-operation,going in this country is the unwillingness of farmers to put up the necessary capital and tc be loyal to the societies when formed.     If tha State takes the responsibility of providing the capital, the farmers will have less inducement than ever to be loyal.,M
Railway Rates.The Tribunal suggest a State subsidy to the Railway Companies sufficient to secure a reduction of 25$ of the existing rates on agricultural produce.    It ds presumed that the Government-would decline to grant any sttoh subsidy.    It would Involve a complete departure from the policy embodied in the Railways Act and would inevitably give rise to demands for similar assistance to other industries.   Negotiations are pro-ceeding at present between agriculturists and the Railway Companies for a reduction of rates and the Ministry will be disappointed if they do not result in substantial reductions being granted.     If t^e negotiations fail^ the proper course is to ap&apos; eal to the Railway Rates Tribunal which has power to enforce a reduction of rates if they are satisfied that the existing rates are more than is sufficient to maintain the 1913 standard of profit.Local Rates.The recommendation of t&quot;e Economists is not clearly expressed, but it is understood that chat they mean is that the grant under the Agricultural Rates Act amounting to  1,325,000 a year (based on the amount required in 1895 to meet the deficiency caused by the reduction of the assessment of agricultural land to one half) should be Increased each year to such an amount as will equal the actual deficit in the preceding year.     The effect of this at present would be an increase in the Exchequer grant of approximately  3,750,000.The Economists appear, however, to have overlooked the fact that the greater part of the benefit of their proposal would go to the non-agricultural rural ratepayer Including such bodies as Colliery Companies and Railway Companies, and only 23$ would go to the occupiers of agricultural land.     The proposal, moreover, would not give any relief to the occupiers of agricultural land in urban areas who are the most heavily
burdened of all farmers.     Por this reason the Ministry is not in favour of the Economists1 proposal and it has suggested that the best method of relieving the burden of rates on the farmer would be to reduce the assessment of agricultural land to one fourth of the rateable value instead of one half.     This could be done  -ithout any increase of the burden on the other ratepayers in rural districts by a new Exchequer grant of  2,728,000, the -whole benefit of which would go to the farmers.The other proposal of the Economists is that the differential rating of agricultural land should be extended to farm buildings.     The Ministry is in favour of this, but it has not been possible in the time available to ascertain what it would cost.Meat Offals.The Tribunal make two proposals:-(1) That Importers of wheat offals should berequired to send a corresponding proportion of wheat offals e.g. 25% of offals to 75$ of flour.(2) Tnat an export duty of 10$ ad valoremshould be imposed on the export of wheat offals.(1)       This proposal, as it stands, presents practical difficulties.     By a &quot;corresponding proportion&quot; is meant, it is presumed, the actual amount of the by-product from the manufacture of flour, and. not a fixed proportion. That is to say/ if the proportion of flour (by weight) from the wheat is e.g, 70$, the amount of offals should be 30$.     It would be impossible for the Customs Officer to carry out such, a proposal, and a fixed proportion of offals would have to be taken.
The second difficulty arises in regard to the quality of the offals.   Here also the Customs Officer could not possiblytell whether the offals imported were,a true example of the . i-offals obtained in the production of the particular parcel of flour imported.   The quality of the offals would have to be left entirely to agreement, between the shipper and the importer       ; of the flour.The British miller will have no objection to this proposal, as its effect would undoubtedly be to restrict&apos;-- &apos; possibly to a very marked.extent - imports of flour, and&apos; thus increase the home manufacture of flour.   The objection will come from:-(a) the Importer;  .(b) the Shipper; , and(c) Colonial Governments.It will, therefore, be contended that the proposal     &apos;. amounts, to protection for home-manufactured flour, since the requirement that a proportionate quantity of offals must accompany imports of flour must necessarily tend to restrict these imports, and;thereby tend to increase the price of flour. Objection, on this ground, will probably be most forcible in Scotland, as the proportion of imported flour used there is Very high, owing to the relatively small capacity of the flour mills . in that country.It may also be urged that a large increase in the supply of offals will reduce the price of offals, and hence.-, increase the price of flour, since.the miller must endeavour to obtain a return from his business as. a whole..Very strong opposition is likely to. come from the:&quot; Australian and Canadian Governments.   The .Imports of. wheat-meal and flour into the United Kingdom In the&apos;.last three years were as under:&apos;-
1980.	1921.	1922.Tons.	Tons.	Tons.106,000	293,000	330,00074,000	69,000	89,000292,000	395,000	229,000126 ,000	35,000	26,000598,000	792,000	674,000Canada. 106,000 293,000 330,000Australia. U.S .A.other Countries. Total:In the first two months of the present year the imports from the three countries named above were 56,000; 7,000; and 53,000 tons respectively.It will be seen, therefore, that Canada, and in a less degree Australia, are very important sources of supply, and that arrivals from Canada are now In excess of those from the United States. Imports from Australia will probably show a decline this year.   It is the competition with Australian flour that has been felt most keenly by the British miller in recent months.   Australian flour was being sold at a lower price than that at which flour made in the United Kingdom from Australian wheat would be sold.   This was specially Investigated by the British and Irish Millers&apos; Association, and it was found that the main reason why the Australian miller was able to under-sell the British miller was that the Australian obtained a much better price for his wheat offals.   This being the case, the requirement that offals should accompany flour, would tell very strongly againstAustralian competition, and is likely to be vigorously opposed by the Australian Authorities.   Some time ago the &quot;Times&quot; published a letter from the Agent General for Western Australia in which resentment was shown towards a proposal by the Central Chamber of Agriculture that a duty should be imposed on imported flour.(2)       while the British miller will probably welcome the first proposal of the Tribunal, he is likely to be opposed to the proposal of an export duty on offals.   It is to be remembered that there is not a full constant demand from the British farmer - at certain periods of the year there is not the same   need for offals ahd consequently millers (particularly the large milling concerns, at the ports) are obliged to export offals, as otherwise the stock of offals would get beyond,their storage capacity.   But the opposition of the millers will depend on the view they take of the value to them of the first proposal if they think the latter outweighs the proposed export duty they will be Prepared to accept the combined proposals.   It is thought that this will I be their attitude.   The export duty on the basis of last year&apos;s export rOi? British produced offals  
would not bring in more than  60,000 per annum.     It would amount to about 15/- per ton and it might not restrict the present volume of export to any marked degree.   But if imports of flour were maintained and were accompanied by increased imports of offals as proposed, prices of offals would have to be reduced, and this loss of income could only be met by increasing the price of flour,28.   Malting Barley.     The Ministry has already submitted to the Chancellor of the Exchequer the proposal mado by the Economists that an Excise Duty of 10/- a quarter should be imposed on foreign barley used for malting, 29&apos;   Hops.       Without entering upon a discussion of the principle involved in a protective duty upon hops it should be pointed out that the duty proposed of 20/- per cwt. on foreign hops would be of little service to the industry.   Brewers possess so much power of passing on their costs to the consuming public, and again the expenditure upon hops forms so small a proportion of the selling price of tho beer that a duty of 20/- per cwt. upon foreign hops would deflect only a very small proportion of the brewer&apos;s purchases from foreign to English hops.   Brewers at present use little more than 2 lbs , of hops per standard barrel;   the proposed duty of 20/- per cwt. on this quantity would, amount to about 5d., whereas the duty per barrel now stands at  5.   The imposition of such a duty would not be acceptable to hop growers in exchange for the abolition of the hop control.   Only the severest restriction of the importation of foreign hops during the period for which the hop control lasts will enable the present surplus of English hops to be reduced to manageable dimensions, and even then after the hop control comes to an end in 1.925 it is only a duty in the order of  5 per cwt. which would effect any considerable permanent diversion of tho brewers purchase from foreign to English hops.
30. Potatoes.     It Is doubtful whether the importation of foreign potatoes has had any serious effect upon the prices of British potatoes,   The importations of foreign potatoes have been as follows :-1914 3,332,164 e.wts.1921 3,061,070     &quot;1922 3,431,38o&apos;     &quot;The crops grown in Great Britain were1914 4,030,688 tons,1921 3,998,000     &quot;1922 5,204,000     &quot;it will thus be seen that the total Imports of potatoes from foreign countries do not amount to more than 4$ of the crop in Great Britain and many of these consist of early potatoes which do not compete with the British crop.Doubtless the importation of Dutch potatoes grown for the German Market had some effect during 1922 in starting the great fall of prices, but the fundamental cause must be put down to extra production at home owing to the exceptionally large acreage planted and the abundant crop.   Nor is It possible to follow the argument with regard to wart and mosaic diseases. Regular examinations are made of imported potatoes to insure their freedom from wart disease0   Mosaic disease is just as prevalent in England as on the Continent and as only in the rarest cases are Continental potatoes planted as seed the existence of mosaic diseases in the imported potatoes sold as ware can have little effect here.   Even if Continental potatoes were from time to time tainted with wart disease which escaped the observation of ther Ministry&apos;s inspectors they are so rarely planted as./seed that we are not likely to incur any disease from that source.   It is. true that certain restrictions are placed upon the growth of potatoes of susceptible varieties in infected areas in Great Britain3 but it is difficult to see how the position of these growers would be improved by restrictions on the import of
foreign potatoes.   All foreign potatoes imported have to be accom-oanied by a certificate guaranteeing they have not been grown within a certain distance of a known outbreak of wart disease.The restrictions on English growers add but an infinitesimal amount to the cost of growing their potatoes and were they removed the result would Dnly be an increased liability to attacks of wart disease with a consequent lossv   The restrictions in fact are only Intended to protect the grower against himself having regard to the prevalence of infected land in certain areas.31 *   Sugar^Beet,. The Ministry is strongly in favour of the continuance of the exemption from any Excise Duty of home grown sugar and it is presumed that the Government will be prepared to announce that it Is not proposed to reimpose the duty.32.   Milk Production.    The Milk,and Dairies Amendment Act, 1922, Clause. 8 gives the Minister of Health power to make regulations for the pre-vention of danger arising to public health from the importation of milk intended for sale for human consumption or for use of the manufactured&quot;&quot;&quot; products for human consumption.This Clause would appear to give the power which the Tribunal recommends should be exercised over imported milk or cream.   As a matter of fact the importations are at i present non-existent,,As regards condensed milk the Order of the Ministry of Health . now provides certain standards of composition within which imported condensed milk must fall.     ; .33,   Co-operative Milk Depots and Creameries..     In 1918 the Ministry initiated an emergency scheme for extending assistance to co-operative societies which would enable them to start milk depots in certain dis-tricts,   Eight loans of half the capital required were made.   In 3 cases the loans have been entirely repaid, in two cases the loans have been partly repaid and the remainder converted into debentures, the repay-ment of which has proceeded regularly.   In two cases (now amalgamated) of a loan of  3,943,  1,443 has been repaid and  2,500 converted into debentures of which  750 have been repaid but the Society is in difficulties about its current repayment.   In one case there has been no repayment,
til V4 W O *J34.   Marking of Imported, Pr oduce.The Ministry is in favour of this recommendation and is supporting the Merchandise Marks Bill which has been introduced hy a Private Member and has passed the Second Reading-in the House of Commons.35-38o   Agricultural Wages.The Tribunal recommends the establishment of six District Wages Boards with power to fix minimum wages for agricultural workers.     This is likely to prove the most contentious proposal of the Tribunal and it is certain to be strongly opposed by an overwhelming majority of the farmers.    On the other hand it will be warmly welcomed by the Labour Party, who have been agitating for the re-establishment of the Agricultural Wages Board,On the merits of the question it cannot be denied that agriculture fulfils both the conditions laid down in the Trade Boards Acts to justify State regulation of wages, but if the proposed Wages Boards resulted in an increase in the existing wages, as would almost certainly be the case, the result would probably be that many farmers would take steps to reduce the number of their labourers.     This would result in increased unemployment particularly among the older men and would stimulate the tendency to reduce the arable area and to lay down land to grass.     The recommendation cannot be regarded, therefore, as conducing to the prosperity of the agricultural industry or to the production of more food from the land,,It is probable that if the Government adopted the recommendation of the Tribunal fresh legislation would be required as it is doubtful if the machinery of the Trade Boards Acts could be applied to agriculture.     Such legislation would raise serious Parliamentary difficulties, as it would be opposed by a considerable number of the supporters of the Government in the House of Commons and the House of Lords might decline to pass it*
39 and 40.     Relief of Rural Unemployment.The Ministry agrees in principle with therecommendations under this heado   Field drainage has not been adopted in England and Wales as a subject for unemployment schemes as the Ministry found that the money available could be spent more profitably on arterial drainage and cleansing of watercourses.     Afforestation schemes have been put into operation by the Forestry Commissioners.     The Ministry considered the possibility of developing lime burning and limestone crushing as subjects for unemployment schemes but there are serious practical difficulties which could not be overcome in time for. any schemes to be put into, operation last winter.41.     Local Administrative Machinery.England and Wales there is In existence a complete system of Local Administrative Machinery through the County Agricultural Committees, the Councils of Agriculture for England and Wales and the Agricultural Advisory Committee.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. 7th April,  1923.This recommendation relates to Scotland.In
