JHIS D0CUM3NT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAIN PC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVBRMMEilT)REDUCTION OF WAR PENSIOIS Aim ALLOWANCES Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.(Previous Papers:- CP.1 s.147 (23), 161(23) and 162(23))I agree in the importance attached by the Minister gf Pensions in his Memorandum of the 13th March, CP, 147(23).. to the maintenance, in the interests of eoonomy, of the existing polioy governing pensions administration and on this ground I do not press the Treasury proposal to reduce Alternative Pensions and pensions under Article 1 (3) (a) of the Officers1 Warrant as from 1st April next, though a good case could be made out for reduction in both oaSes, notwithstanding the general concession already made on the flat rate pensions.But the Treatment Allowances, and the Training Allowances which are administered under the Labour Ministry and which are in substantially the same position, raise more important issues.    Owing to the heavy fall in wages since these allowances were fixed, the existing allowances have become so generous that public opinion would hardly defend their continuance if the facts were generally known.Ttka the case of a man, who is not a pensioner, with a wife and four children.    For this purpose there is no discrimination (as in the case of pensions) as to the date of his marriage or the dote of birth of the children provided they are under 16 years of age.    Such a man, when employed5 fjjjl.542CABINET
would now be receiving in wages probably from 4o/- to 6?/-a week according to his trade and whether he is skilled or not.     When he receives treatment in hospital he ie given entire maintenance free and allowances in addition totalling&apos; 66/6, while, if he is treated at home, his allowances (to include his own maintenance) will&apos;be 75/6. ;. In many cases the man receives in addition sickne,ss benefit at a reduced rate Of 7/6. a week under the Health Insurance Scheme.     Is there any wonder that the Ministry&apos;s bill for medical treatment and allowances for next&quot;year, even after the Treasury had reduced their estimates by  800,000, is as high as  6,200,000?.     Very much the same difficulty arises over training. The. allowances for a man reoaiving training while living at home are the same as for a man under&apos;treatment at home, while a man with dependents, reoeiving training away&apos; from homo, gets 17/6d, a week extra, i.e, in the above case the allowances will amount to 93/- a week.    If the-man had been a non-commissioned officer in the Army, the aggregate would be increased by an amount from 3/4d. to l3/4d. a week according to hie old Army rank.   With such conditions it ie not surprising that men stay out their full course of training and are slow to find jobs.   The ,total.\eatimata for training for next year is  3,000,000 making, with the cost of&apos; treatment an aggregate bill of over  9,000,000.    I am confident that at least  75*0,000 of this large total could be saved by a revision of allowances without the; slightest injustice to individuals.I have discussed the matter with the Minister of Pensions and representatives of the Ministry of labour and I find that they are in.general agreement with me that a reduction in the present rates of allowance would be fully justifiable and would he very; desirable on administrative
grounds, and indeed that it ought to he made sooner or later. The objections &quot;to making the reduction at once are political. I recognize of course that the Ministry are receiving con  aiderable attention at the present time in Parliament and that -It would -be most unfortunate for the Government to propose a.,-revised scheme of allowances and then withdraw it.    But is there, serious risk of this?   Would not our supporters recognize the economic absurdity of the present arrangement? After the -very generous exemption, of flat rate pensions from revision for three years at a cost to the Exchequer of  7,000,000 a year -an exemption which I would agree, to extend to alternative pensions and pensions under Article 1 (3) (a) - it oan hardly be pleaded that the Government is treating the War pensioner ungenerously.Bat whatever the, political arguments for postpone-iiient of reduction may be, there are powerful, arguments agsint postponement.    The Secretary of State for War points out that the Service pensions and the pay of the fighting services are linked up with the cost of living and we all look before very long to seeing the high rates of pay of the school teachers and the polipe revised on the same ground.    But if the war pensioner escapes all revision this year, however strong the case for it may be, the difficulty of dealing with these other cases will be greatly increased, which means of course continued heavy burdens on the taxpayer and the ratepayer.Arid what prospect have we of reducing pensions at all in 1926 if. notwithstanding the express provision in the Royal Warrants, pensions have been drawn for 6 years on the basis equivalent to a cost of living figure cf 11J over pre-war without any revision even in the most glaring case&apos;&quot;? Like the Ministry of Pensions I thirds; that our best pol..y will be to seek powers in 1924   or 1925 to stabilise pensions onoe and for all in April 1926 and the precise terms will be
a matter of difficult negotiation.   This negotiation is likely to &quot;be carried on with greater relief to. the taxpayer &apos; if the situation is not then complicated by this comparatively minor question of treatment allowances.Lastly, the anomalies pf the present position have only recently become so obvious owing, to. the heavy fall&apos;&apos; in wages during last year.   If the present opportunity is:&apos; passed&apos; by, people will become more accustomed to them and&apos; the support we might now count upon in dealing with-the matter&apos; will decline * especially if, when the matter-4s at--&apos;length brought forward, we are nearing the time for a general election&apos;.&apos;&quot;    &quot; In view of these considerations. I&apos;.. would.-urge my colleagues to agree to a revision of these allowances- on a&apos; reasonable bssis forthwith.I-!; j&apos; &quot;&apos;    &apos; (intd,)&apos; S.
