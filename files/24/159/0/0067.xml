SECRET. 507(I.R.Q. 41.)SiCABINET.COMMITTEE ON IRAQ.Report.THE Committee have held eight sittings, in the course of which they have made an exhaustive examination of every aspect of the exceedingly difficult problem submitted to them. In this examination they have derived useful assistance from the presence and advice of Sir Percy Cox, who was summoned from Baghdad for the purpose.The Committee have been conscious from- the start that there exists a powerful body of opinion, both in Parliament and the country, which favours, mainly for financial reasons, an early escape from the responsibilities which His Majesty&apos;s Government have been forced to assume in Iraq during and since the war; while in some quarters there has been a loud call for immediate evacuation.The Committee have given due weight to these considerations, the force of which they have no desire to minimise. On the other hand, they have felt it to be their duty to examine with much care the extent to which the policy of evacuation, whether immediate or gradual, is reconcilable with the pledges into which the British Government have entered, with their obligations as the mandatory Power, with the interests of the country and the peoples concerned, and with the larger interests of Great Britain and the British Empire.A novel factor has been introduced into the case, since the appointment of the Committee, by the proceedings of the recent Conference at Lausanne. At that Conference the future of Mosul, which is an important part of the mandated territory of Iraq, became one of the chief points of controversy between the Turkish and British Delegations. The Foreign Secretary, acting under the direct instructions of His Majesty&apos;s Government, declined to surrender the Mosul Vilayet to the Turks, and showed by argument that it was an indispensable and inseparable part of the Arab Kingdom of Iraq. He ended by referring-the dispute to the League of Nations, but agreed to postpone the reference for a year in order to admit of a possible settlement by negotiation between the British and Turkish Governments. It still remains for this solution to be incorporated in the Treaty of Peace.In these circumstances it is obviously impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Govern-nient to surrender by any immediate decision, or by a hurried evacuation, the territory which they have just declined to give up since it cannot be doubted that were the British forthwith to withdraw from Iraq, not only would Mosul fall immediately into the hands of the Turks, but the Arab Kingdom, which so much effort has been expended in order to build up, would collapse. The conclusion,of peace with Turkey therefore marks a definite stage upon which the entire future of Iraq will depend, and prior to which it is impossible to take decisions which might fatally compromise the prospects of peace.Apart from these considerations, which in any case necessitate a postpone-ment of withdrawal (even if the latter were accepted on its merits), the Committee have come to the conclusion that immediate or precipitate withdrawal is impossible for the following reasons: L It is the considered view of the General Staff and the Air Staff that the shortest possible time within which evacuation could be carried out, without the assistance of further reinforcements, would probably be [9716]    i b 2
not less than two years. A more rapid evacuation would entail the despatch of reinforcements and a heavier expenditure; and the risk would consequently be greater than were the retirement spread out over a longer space of time.2. Whatever be the precise value and implications of the promises and engagements entered into by His Majesty&apos;s Government towards the Arab State and the Arab peoples since 1914, an immediate withdrawal, involving the downfall of the Kingdom of Iraq, would be regarded, and in the opinion of a majority of the Committee would be justly regarded, as a breach of faith on the part of the British nation, which would inflict irreparable damage on British honour and British prestige throughout the Bast.3. Such a withdrawal, in the present state of our mandatory relations with Iraq, would also be a breach of faith to the League of Nations, at whose instance we are continuing pending a final settlement by Treaty or otherwise to carry on the Administration.4. The return of the Turks to Iraq and the downfall of the Arab Kingdom would carry with it consequences of a far-reaching character. It is not to be anticipated that a victorious Turkey would halt at Mosul. She would demand and she would obtain, because at any time she could seize, Baghdad. Neither, having recovered Baghdad, would she be willing to stop short of Basrah, and even were such an arrangement made, and a British boundary drawn between Baghdad and Basrah, the expenses of such an arrangement would be scarcely less great than those which we are now bearing, while Basrah would become a term irredenta to Nationalist Turkey.5. Nor would the consequences, in all probability, be confined to the Kingdom of Iraq alone. The presence of a victorious Turkey at the head of the Persian Gulf could hardly leave British interests in that sea and in the adjoining area, from which the oil supplies of the British Navy are mainly drawn, unimpaired. A Bolshevised Persia, which is a not unlikely sequel, would aggravate the danger. Further it is the considered opinion both of the Foreign and. Colonial Offices that the return of the Turks to Iraq would be the inevitable prelude to an agitation which would not cease until Syria and Palestine had experienced a similar fate.If this were the case, Britain would have fought the Asiatic war in vain, Turkey would have been the victor, not in Europe alone, but in Asia also, and hei triumph would not be a mere reversion to the status quo ante, but would plant an aggressive Islamic State in a central site, where she would be in a position to control the fortunes of the Middle East, with results to British interests in those regions, and even in India, that might well in the long run be disastrous.These considerations have led the Committee to the conclusion that a policj of immediate withdrawal is out of the question.It then remained for us to consider (1) within what space of time oui obligations could honourably and safely be brought to an end; (2) what should In the nature and extent of the financial outlay which we should accept during tin interim period; (3) in what way a progressive curtailment and the ultimate termim tion of British responsibilities can best be adjusted to the political or contracts relations into which we have entered.1. Taking the conclusion of peace with Turkey as the datum point, vi advise the Cabinet that the period within which our mandatory relations \vi Iraq and our expenditure on that country should be brought to an end shall be s the longest four years from the date of ratification of the Turkish Peace Treat) When we speak of the termination of the mandate, we have in mind that as so as Iraq has been admitted to the League of Nations (and we have undertaken I use our good offices for her admission as soon as possible) the mandatory relation between Great Britain and Iraq will automatically come to an end.   But, in orfi to enable her admission to come about, the League of Nations will require to assured that the frontiers of Iraq are settled, and that a stable government ha been set up conditions the satisfaction of which must to a large extent detenu&apos; our policy, as will presently be indicated, in the intervening years.
2. During the interim period we recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Government should incur no expenditure on civil administration other than the salary and expenses of the High Commissioner and his staff, for which an estimate can be given. The liability of His Majesty&apos;s Government in these respects will not exceed J30,000 a year. The military and air expenditure incurred by His Majesty&apos;s Government on Iraq should be terminated within the same period, a progressive reduction taking place in each year. It has not been possible for the Committee to fix the exact total of this expenditure. The best plan would probably be for provisional estimates to be agreed upon between the Treasury, Colonial Office and Air Ministry, and to be submitted to the Cabinet for approval. These, if approved, could be stated in the House of Commons, when the general statement of policy is made.There is a force of levies in Iraq, some 4,500 in number, mainly consisting of Assyrian Christians and Kurds with British officers, for the payment of which His Majesty&apos;s Government is at present responsible, the financial resources of the Iraq Government, who are bound to spend 25 per cent, of their budget on defence, being at present insufficient to enable them to do more than maintain the Arab army of about 4,000 men and the police. The Committee are of opinion (1) that it would be unwise to disband this force at once, since, in four years&apos; time, it may constitute the most valuable element in the future defence of Iraq; and (2) that its temporary maintenance, subject to any reduction or transfer it may be found advisable to make, should in consequence continue to be included in the Military charges borne by His Majesty&apos;s Government, on the understanding that King Feisal be informed that all British expenditure on this head will cease at the close of the interim period, or if possible earlier, when it is contemplated that the levies will be absorbed into the defensive forces of the Iraq State.As regards the Treaty with King Peisal, which was signed in October 1922, and communicated officially to the Council of the League of Nations in November 1922, but which has not yet been ratified, the Committee are of the opinion that ratification could not, when the requisite conditions have been fulfilled, be honourably withheld. This, however, cannot in any case take place for some time to come. Por in the first place, Article 18 of the Treaty requires that it must have been previously accepted by the Constituent Assembly, and secondly, this Assembly cannot be convened and cannot act until the frontiers of Iraq have been determined and the Mosul question settled. In other words ratification is not likely to occur for at least a year, and possibly for longer.In the meantime there are features in the Treaty, particularly as regards the military and financial obligations entailed, which have caused not unnatural apprehension. If the recommendations which have been made in this Report are accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government, it should be easy to remove these apprehensions by a Protocol stating that, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 18 of the Treaty, which lays down that &quot; it shall remain in force for twenty years,&quot; the Treaty itself shall terminate within the period now laid down, to be replaced, it may be, by some other arrangement on lines which will be indicated later on.In the meantime the Committee have prepared drafts of the subsidiary Agreements provided for in Articles 7 and 15 of the Treaty, regulating the extent and conditions of the material support to be afforded during the interim period. These drafts are submitted herewith, and the Committee recommend that they should be concluded without delay.There remain the questions (a) whether the arrangements here proposed are likely to be acceptable to the Iraq Government, and (b) what is the future that may be anticipated when the interim period comes to an end. On the first point we have the affirmative view of Sir Percy Cox, provided that His Majesty&apos;s Government announce their intention to ratify the Treaty as modified by the subsidiary Agreements and by the accompanying Protocol.On the second point we anticipate that, although the mandatory relations of Great Britain with Iraq and the financial liabilities of His Majesty&apos;s Government will have terminated within the stated period, it will be the desire both of King Peisal and the people of Iraq that the special relations existing between Great Britain and the Arab Kingdom shall not be abruptly terminated, but that an agreement will be capable of conclusion between the two Governments on some such lines as those of the Anglo-Persian Agreement of 1919, which may admit of British assistance being given to the Arab State, at no cost to His Majesty&apos;s
Government, with a view to the development of its resources and the stability of its administration. In such an arrangement special provision for the maintenance of British interests, including those relating to the port of Basrah and facilities for Imperial air routes, may profitably be included;Should1 these expectations be realised, it may yet be that; Iraq will constitute a stable factor in the group of British interests in the East, without either imposing a burden upon the British Exchequer or entailing military liabilities which His Majesty&apos;s Government would be unwilling to assume.(Signed on behalf of the Committee)DEVONSHIRE.March 23, 1923.Draft Protocol.It is understood between the High Contracting Parties that, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 18, the present Treaty shall terminate upon Iraq becoming a member of the League of Nations and in any case not later than four years from the ratification of peace with Turkey. Nothing in this Protocol shall prevent a fresh agreement from being concluded with a view to regulate the subsequent relations between the High Contracting Parties; and negotiations for that object shall be entered into between them before the expiration of the above period.
