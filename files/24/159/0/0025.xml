[HJJ9-CTJMfiNT IS TEE PRQPBRTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S^ GOVERNMENT.CABINET .IT. Copy No.    i,2J Home Affairs Committee. *&quot; &quot;*&quot;%25i25hMental Treatment Bill. Memorandum by the Minister of Health.Much public attention continues to be drawn to the problems Of lunacy law and administration and there is con-sidcrahle pressure from time to time for the appointment of a Royal Commission to go into the wlxole question.As regards lunacy admlnlstrationi my predecessor appointed, a Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir Cyril Cobb to investigate serious charges of mal-administration made by Dr. Montagu Lomax in a published book.     The Committee reported In July. 1922, and their report has been presented to Parliament. A circular has recently been issued, to lunacy authorities calling their attention to the main recommendations of the Committee, and I am taking action in other directions to give effect to the recommendations, e.g., by setting up an Advisory Committee to assist local authorities in selecting the moat suitable men for the post of medical superintendent in public asylums and drafting a new definition of seclusion to meet tho difficulties pointed out by the Committee,Other Committees were appointed by my predecessor to investigate nursing and diet and those Committees are expected to report at an early date.As regards the lunacy law, I agree with the view of my predecessor that there is no present case for a Royal Commission. The whole ground was covered by a hoyal Commission, which reported some ten years ago, and a Commission now would be simply a cause of considerable expense and delay in effecting improvement.&apos; There/
There are certain points in the lunacy laws on which there appears to be a great measure of unanimity in favour of amendment.     Such points are -(l) the advisability of making it obligatory to include &apos; women on the Visiting Committees who practically administer the Lunacy Acts.(2)     the giving of power to the local authorities which appoint the Committees to include on them a proportion of specially qualified persons not members of the local authorities.(3)     the giving of power to a   Visiting Committee to exercise Its powers and duties in combination by agreement with any other Visiting Committee.(4)     the giving of power to Visiting Committees to make provision for the after-care of persons who have been undergoing treatment in their institutions.(5)     the giving of power to Visiting Committees to undertake research either themselves or in combination with other Visiting Committees In connection with mental infirmity, and to make contributions towards the expenses of any body of persons engaged in such research.There is further a strong demand that definite legal provision should be made whereby persons suffering from mental disorder but not certified under the Lunacy Acts may receive out-patient and in-patient treatment in public institutions without such certification.     Provision of this kind has been legal in Scotland for fifty years but does not exist in England and Wales except that &quot;voluntary boarders&quot; can be received, in registered hospitals and houses licensed under the lunacy Acts. .   There is sound reason for thinking that if the law in England and Wales in brought up to the Scottish standard, the effect in reducing the number of persons whom it is necessary to certify will be considerable and on medical, humanitarianand/
and economic, grounds alike, the argument for an amendment in the law is very cogenti I propose accordingly -(l)    that Visiting Committees shall be empowered to receive, maintain and treat in their institutions persons desirous of voluntarily submitting themselves for the purpose;(2)    that they shall be empowered to provide or arrange for out-patient treatment of persons suffering from mental disorder;(3)    that they (or the Committee of a hospital registered under the Lunacy Acts or the proprietor of a house licensed under those Acts) may, with the approval of the Board of Control, receive in their institutions, or arrange with voluntary hospitals to receivej persons suffering from mental disorder.A draft Bill; which has been settled by the Parliamentary Counsel, Carrying out the above proposals is attached to this memorandum.I should draw attention to three points which feriuire no tice.First as to departmental responsibility under this Bill.    There is one body of opinion which main tains that the sphere of the Board of Control should be limited strictly to certified lunacy and that the persons referred to in the Bill, not being certified lunatic3, should be outside the sphere of the Visiting Committees and the Board of Control and. under the responsibility of the Ministry of Health and the local authorities as distinct from the Visiting Committees.   This point is one of difficulty, but I agree with the conclusion of.my predecessor that, the arguments In favour cf placing this work under the
Visiting C ova-nit teas and the Board of Control are conclusive. The&apos; other solution means the setting up of duplicate machinery in the areas and at headquarters for dealing with two classes of persons who often are very difficult to di3tinguish -there would be extra expense and great confusion of functions. The Board of Control, as it is now constituted and operates, is keenly desirous of as Tuning the new duties * and its desire was strongly supported at a numerously attended conference of medical superintendents and representatives of Visiting Committees early last year.   If responsibility for mental disorder is taken away from the Board, its aspirations towards improvement and modernisation of treatment would receive a very regrettable setback.   I think the Board is quite capable of doing the work and should have the responsibility for it.The second question is the question of safeguards against improper or illegal detention of In-patients,   One safeguard will be the ordinary machinery of visiting and inspection by the Board of Control which is preserved by the Bill.   But it is proposed further - (l) that a person received as a patient suffering from mental disorder must be received on a recommendation signed by two medical practitioners, one of whom will be a person nominated for this work by the Board of Control or by the local authority within whose area the institution is situate into which the patient   is to be received,  (2) that such a person cannot be received and maintained for a period exceeding six months subject, in suitable cases,  to extension for one further period of six months either with the approval of the Board of Control or upon a further recommendation, (3) that he may leave at any time on 48 hours notice to a responsible person of his intention to do so,  (4) that the Board or the medical superintendent or any person entitled under the Lunacy Acts to direct the discharge of a private patient from an Institution may at any time direct the discharge of a person received under the Bill,
It will further he seen that powers inregard to persons treated under the Bill shall be restricted to public authorities, except as regards theCommittee of a registered hospital or the proprietors of licensed houses.     Licensed houses are really private asylumsfor the well-to-do and subject to special and very frequentinspection by the   Board of Control.     Their number is limited by Section 207 of the Act of 1B90, and thatlimitation is maintained in this Bill.     Registered hospitalsare few in.number and do not increase - they are mostlycharitable foundations under special and frequent Inspection,If it appears that public opinion demands that the powers conferred by this Bill be exercised by public authoritiesonly, I should have no objection to such a course.The third point is the question of inspection.Under the Mental Deficiency Act of 1913 - which greatlyIncreased the work of visiting required to be done by the------- : ;      &apos; - -&apos;. -.- i -Commissioners - the number of paid Commissioners was raised to eleven.     At the present time the- number of visitingCommissioners is only 7 including a woman who, beingneither a lawyer nor a doctor, is not competent to pay any statutory visits.     The existing staff cannot cope with the constantly growing number of inspections and essential local work, with the result that the statutory provisions in the matter are not being complied with.     Warpressure having passed, the position in the matter isalready seriously open to attack and the Bill may throw,at all events at the outset, extra inspection on the Boardof Control.     It is out of the question, particularlyin view of the safeguards required under the Bill, to propose any reduction in the number of statutory visits,and as a good deal of the visitation and local work now
done by the Commissioners could, in the view of the Board of Control; be efficiently done by Inspectorsif the lav? allowed, the most economical and effective solution appears to be to authorise this by the Bill.&apos; A sufficient number of inspectors would be appointed to enable the work of inspection and local work to be fully and efficiently carried out and this change, in conjunction with a re-organ!sation of the clerical work at the Board of Control, would make it popsable to reduce the statutory number of Commissioners under the Act of1913 as proposed in the Bill?I desire authority for the Introduction of the Bill in the House of Lords at an early date.A.G, BOSOAlf/EN.
