(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERT&quot;; OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERN ME NT)SJiJLILE-i&apos; CP.105(23) .C A B I Hi T,UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE, C0M.MI TTEE&apos; 3 RBTOrI&apos; &quot;10, P&apos;7 &apos;9v (237&apos;7T&quot;. Note by the Secretary, Cabinet.sThe following decisions were taken by the Cabinet at their Meeting held at 11,50 a.ih. on Wednesday, February 14th, 1923, on the recommendations contained in the Report of the Unemployment Insurance Committee CP. 97(25).(Signed) M.P.AJ HANKEY,Secretary, Cabinet.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I. February 16th, 1925.(a) To approve the Report of the Cabinet Committee on Unemployment insurance (Paper CP.-97(23)), the main recom-mendations of which may be summed up as follows:-(i) The Fourth Special Period to be extended from 1st July to 17th October, 1923.   During the period as thus extended a maximum of 44 weeks of benefit (covenanted or uncovenanted) to be granted, but after 22 weeks have been drawn in any particular case since the begin-ning of the Fourth Special Period there will be a &quot;gap&quot; of a fortnight:
(li) The twelve months from mid-October1923 to mid-October 1924 to be treat-ed as a benefit year during which a maximum of 26 weeks of benefit (covenanted or unfiovenanted) may be drawn.     In order to spread this over a longer period than 26;  weeks, indi-viduals to serve a &quot;gap&quot; of three weeks after they have received all covenanted benefit (if any) to vhich they are entitled, plus twelve weeks of uncove-nanted benefit, or after twelve weeks of uncovenanted benefit if they are not qualified for any covenanted benefit:(iii)Tha additional temporary benefit at present payable, viz, 5/* for a wife and l/i for each young child, to be made a permanent feature of the in-surance scheme, a corresponding ad-justment being made in the rate of contributions at the1 end of the deficiency period. &apos;   As from the same date the State contribution to the scheme; io be one-fourth of the joint contribution of employers and employed - the fate fixed in the Act of 1920 -instead of the rate of one-third payable under the present emergency Acts:(iv) The refunds now payable to insured persons at the age of 60 (which are based on the value of their own. share of contributions paid, less benefit received) to be abolished for the future, subject to limited compensa-tion in respect of the contingent rights of those insured persons who are now aged 50 years or over:(v) To substitute, for the present rule under which covenanted be-nfit is limited in the ratio of one week of benefit for every six contributions paid, a new rule under ?hich the number of weeks of benefit will be assessed according to the average number of contributions paid in the three preceding insurance years. This change would not come into effect till the period beginning mid-October, 1923, and the normal scale of contri-butions qualifying for various periods of benefit should probably be relaxed during the first two or three years of its operation, owing to the abnormal unemployment which has prevented large mimbers of insured persons from having the opportunity to pay  contributions.
(b) That the Minister of Health should prepare for the consideration of the Cabinet, a circular to boards of Guardians, urging that any relief given under the Poor Laws to supplement Unemployment Benefit should be so ad lusted as to ensure that the aggregate sum granted to any individual should be substantially less than the sum which the individual could earn if he obtained employment.The Minister of &quot;ealth undertook^ in pre-paring this circular, to give careful ; consideration to a proposal that the aggregate amount should not exceed 75 per cent, of what the individual could earnif in employment.i(c) That the Minister of Labour should examine the possibility of drawing the attentionof the local Thrtployment Committees to cases where the supplementary grants by Boards of Guardians were high,,(d) That the minister of Labour should be author-ised, without anticipating the Unemployment Insurance &quot;ill, to make a general statement in the course of the Debate on the Address&quot;; based on the decisions of the Cabinet onthe subject,(e) That consideration of, and any announcement regarding, a proposal made at the Cabinet for an expert Fnq-ulry into the whole scheme of Unemployment Insurancef Health Insurance, Poor Law, Pensionsj etc., should be deferred until the dimensions of the future unemploy-ment problem became clearerr.(f) To take note that the question whether it will be possible to arrange for a joint card for Health Insurance and Unemployment Insur-a nee is under consideration, and that the&apos; provisions referred to above in. (a)(iv) and (v.), which are consistent with a joint card, were being inserted in the Bill in order to make certain other administrative economies possible.(g) That it would be inadvisable at the present stage to state definitely in Parliament that uncovenanted benefit would come to an end after October, 1924, more particularly as the policy of the Government would be clearly indicated in the Unemployment Insurance Bill.
