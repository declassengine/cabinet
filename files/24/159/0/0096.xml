CcrraTUTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE FROPBHTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY18GOVERNMENT.SECRETCP .196    (25).CABINET.BRITISH EMPIRE EXHIBITION INCORPORATED. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate herewith the Draft of a Bill to amend the Memorandum of Association of the British Empire Exhibition Incorporated by authorising the payment of a salary to the Deputy Chairman of the Executive Council thereof.It is unnecessary to enter Into the e arly history of the Exhibition, but it will be recalled that criticisms were made with regard to the conduct of its business, as a result of which, an investigation was carried out by 3ir William Joynson-Hioks.   One of the recommendations made by Sir William Joynson-Hicks was for the delegation of the executive powers of the Executive Council to a Standing Committee, the Deputy Chairman of which should give the whole of his time to the work and receive adequate remuneration.   General Sir Travers Clarke, lately Quartermaster General to the Forces, has been appointed Deputy Chairman, and it is intended that he should receive remuneration&apos;from the. dato of his appointment.The Memorandum of Association of the British Empire Exhibition Incorporated provides in Clause 4 that no person In the position of a Director or Member of the Executive Council shall be appointed to any salaried office of the Association, and that no remuneration shall be given to any such person.This provision is not one of the objects of the Association, and therefore cannot be altered by a resolution of the A.association with the approval of the Court.   Hence the
necessity for legislation to enable remuneration to be paid to the Deputy Chairman of the Executive Council in order to give effect to Sir William Joynson-Hicks&apos; recommendation.In view of the action taken by the Government with regard to the investigation. I think that this measure should be Introduced as a Government Bill.   I am inclined to the view that if the Home Affairs Committee agree, it would be more expeditious for the Bill to be introduced in the House of Lords, and I understand, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, as Chairman of the Executive Council of the Exhibition, 1b prepared to introduce the Bill in the Lords and take it to its second reading.In the meantime, the Association are being asked to approve the Bill by a formal Resolution.   I would urge that an early decision be taken in this matter. .P .L1.G. 14/4/23 .
