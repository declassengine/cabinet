THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 03? HIS BRITAMIC MAJESTY13 GOVERNMENT,CABINET.&apos;INTERNATIONAL LABOUR OFFICE BUDGET t, - 0There will he a moating of tho Governing Body of the International Labour office   at Geneva on the 10th April which will be preoeded on the 5th April by a meeting of the Finance Committoo of that Body which is the controlling financial authority for the Organisation.    Mr. Betterton, Parliamentary Socretary to the Ministry of Labour, has succeeded Major Boyd-Oarpenter as His Majesty1a Government Representative on both the Governing Body and the Finance Committee.   Matters of considerable financial Importance are to bo discussed at this meeting.   I therafore thin&amp; it neoossai-y, in addition to the ordinary procedure by which tho instructions for the British Representative are generally approved by the Cabinet, to ask for specific directions upon two points arising on the finanoes of the Office,(2)   The estimated expenditure of the Offioe for 1923 was 8,200,462Swiss franos.   There is reason to suppose that the actual expendi-ture may not exceed 7,000,000 francs.   Tho draft estimates for 1924,as submitted by tho Offioe for consideration at the forthcoming mootingprovide for a net oxpondituro of about 8,500,000 franos, whioh isabout 400,000 francs in excess of the estimated expenditure for 1923.In addition to this, It should bo observed that thore is an increasing deficit as a result of arrears of contributions by StateMembers which amounts to anything between 2,000,000 and 3,000*000Swiss francs,   It is impossiblo to spooify this figure more accuratelybeoause it is not known what arrears aro being paid in from timo totime and at what rato the contributions for 1923 are ooming In.   Itshould be added that Great Britain, upon the present basis of contribution^ pays a tenth of tho total cost of tho League, andGreat Britain and France are the only Members of. the League now graded as contributors of the first class, (i,e0 those who are responsible for 95 out of 946 units in the present provisional allocation of contribution) but, in fact France is allowed a deduction of 17 units in consideration of her devastated regions, a privilege which she shares with certain other belligerents.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OP LABOUR
therefore of the Office? and the Empire ae a whole pays more than a fourth of the total contribution)   or taking account of the fact that many States do not contribute; the Empire as a whole appears to pay a third of all that is paid,(3)     In tha next plage, it should be noted that the aotual sum voted for Great Britain in cash towards tho expenses of the International Labour Office in 1922 wag  85;983 and the figure for 1923 amounted to  33,i-30.     There is, therefore,, an additional charge In respect of 1923.   If the increased Budget for 1924 were voted,  this figure would be further increased9(4)     Having regard to all the circumstances, I myself, when British Representative, and my successor, Major Boyd-Oarpenter, took every opportunity of insisting upon reduction of expenditurej   at the meeting at Rome last EftBter I succeeded in getting the Budget for 1923 reduced by some 600,000 francs. As a result, particularly of the action taken by Major Boyd-Oarpenter at the-last meeting of the finance Committee, the International Labour.Office   Invited Mr. A. W. Watson, Director of Establishments of the Ministry of Labour, to make a detailed enquiry into the staffing of the Office.   Mr, Watson&apos;s report indicates the possibility of an immediate saving, without any substantial reorganisation, of 720,000 francs during 1924 and a further saving of practically the same amount if a general reorganisation of the kind which he suggests is carried out. His report designedly does not deal with the economies which could, be effected by alterations ot policy though In many directions the report suggests points of policy to which attention should bo directed.(5)     As regards the reductionsproposed by Mr. Watson arid any reductions in respect of policy, it should cf course be observed that great difficulties will be encountered both from the Labour Members of the Governing Body and from certain States in prossing for any reductions whatever.    This opposition will most probably/be
be backed, if not provoked, by the Head of the Office, Monsieur- Thomas.   Moreover, if Great Britain strenueusly insists upon economy, there is no doubt that attempts will be made both in this country and in Europe generally to portray His Majesty&apos;s Government as an enemy of the Labour Organisation and of the League a(6)     In spite of the foregoing considerations, I havo no doubt that every effort must be made to secure drastic economies and that an attempt must be made to secure that the Budget for 1924 in fact balances.   In my view, It is doubtful whether any Budget which provides for more than 5,500,00,3 francs net will balance, though more optimistic views as to revenue are reported to be held by the League Officials,   it must be remembered that in 1924, as in all preceding years, there will be a number of States which do not pay their contributions.     The courso to be adopted in relation to this default is a matter which will require careful consideration . in consultation with the Treasury.   It is clear however that even with the reduction of expenditure now proposed the British contribution of  53,880 cannot be reduced in 1924 if the Budget Is to balance.     On the other hand, it will not be increased.     It should be added that the International Labour Office propose that the Budget for 1924 should In addition include 1,600,000 francs to extinguish the deficit at the. end of 1923 but this would mean an increase of  6,000 in the contribution by Great Britain and should not, I think, be agreed to.     Further, the League have approved the erection of a permanent building for the International Labour Office at a cost of 3,000,000 francs;   I secured a reduction of this estimate to 2,500,000 francs but I think the polioy of erecting a big permanent building should be reviewed In the light of Mr, Watson&apos;s report and of the financial situation as explained above./m
(7)   But if this polioy ie to bo carried out..   5 it involves a paper reduction of over 2,700,000 francs upon this year&apos;s   Budget though tho actual reduction will be nearer l,500r00O&quot;-^raJ3cs.     The questions accordingly which I wish to submit for Cabinet decision are tho following:-(a) is Mr. Botterton to insist on the full 2,700^000 reduotlon, to 5,500,000 franos so far as heas a slnglo member of tho Governing Body is able to secure it, and. nothing less, or is ho, while attempting to secure the 2,700,000, to aooept the most reasonable terms that he aan obtain.(b) If, as is possible, tho whole question is met by the Director of the Office, not primarily as one of finance but of oonfidenoe in him-self, is this issue to bo definitely pressed to a division, with the possibility of tho resignation of tho Director?(8) As regards the first point, it seems to mo that Mr. Betterton must be givon some reasonable latitude.     Oloarly, if tho suggestions of the Office or tho proposals for economy of the Finance Committoo drop below a figure say of 1,950,000 (making a Budget of 6,250,000 franos) then I think that Mr, Betterton should be Instructed definitely to vote against what is decided by tho Finance Committee.     If, however, he is able to secure any figure between 1,950,000 and 2,700,00c   I think he should be given discretion to accept.    Any sums required for compensation on abolition of posts to aecure/ economy
ooulcL, if necessary bo agreed to in addition to the Budget of 5,500,000 or 6,250,000 francs. (9)   With regard to the second point, if Monsieur Thomas threatened to resign, or in fact did resign, it would certainly be stated that Great Britain had done its best to wreck the Offioo.     On the other hand, it seems to me that unless we aro prepared to faoe this issue, wo shall never be ablo to plaoe the finances of the Office on a really sound foundation.    Until tho Direotcr has fully understood that His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to insist on economies at whatever cost, ho will not bo able, by reason of pressure from the Labour group, to co-operate wholeheartedly.     I confess that I regard the possibility of his resignation with regret and&apos; I do not know who is to replaoo him.     Nevertheless, I think in the ovent suggested abevo, Mr,Botterton should havo definite instructions, if he dooms it necessary, to press tho matter to a decision.(10)   I should add that any pronouncaroent which the representative of the British Government may make will be prefaced by a clear declaration that Great Britain adheres to the I.L.O.sohsmo (i.o. Part XIII of the Treaty).   All that we desire to insist upon is that the Office shall be roorganisod- so as to be run on lines whioh can be defended by tho Government in ths event of criticism in -the Bouse of Commons or elsewhera.
