[THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MA J 3TYTS GOVERNMENT]SECRET.CP. 199 (23)Copy No.IllCABINET,Report of Agricultural (Economists&apos; report) Committee.1,     In accordance with our Terras of Reference (Cabinet 18 (23) Conclusion 1 (b)), we have considered the recommendations of the Agricultural Tribunal of Investigation (C.Pf 181 (23)).2.     A decision on the recommendations of the Tribunal as regards:Local Rates HopsSugar BeetMarking of imported produce and Railway Rateswas reached at a meeting of the Cabinet en the ICth April (Cabinet 18 (23) Conclusion 1 (a)).As regards the remainder of the Tribunal&apos;s recoramenda-tions, we make the following proposals to the Cabinet   lEDTTj. 3,     A bill on this subject is at present being drafted andwill shortly be examined by the Home Affairs Committee.   We do not, therefore, consider it necessary to make any recommendation on this matter.BEAT PFAL3,4.     We see considerable difficulty in adopting the Tribunal&apos;s recommendations.   The proposal has already somewhat disturbed the Australian and Canadian Governments and there are administrative difficulties In the way of a tax on exported offals.   We consider that the Tribunal&apos;s recommendation should hot be accepted.5,    We are strongly of. opinion that the Tribunal&apos;s recommendation for an Excise Duty of 10/- a quarter on imported malting barley with a preference of l/3rd on barley imported from the Dominions should be accepted and we think it-desirable that a statement on the subject should be made in the course of the Debate on the Budget.
POTATOES. 6.      We are unable to accept the recommendation ofthe Tribunal that imports of foreign potatoes should be permitted only under a general licence for specified periodsciMILK PRO- 7.      The Tribunal recommends in paragraph 33 that thet)IJC3T&apos;I OK.State should actively encourage the formation of farmers&apos; associations or companies, formed fdr the purpose of establishing depots for the collection and proper treatment of milk and for the conversion of surplus milk Into dried or preserved milk, butter or cheese.   The Tribunal suggests that a loan should be advanced to assist in the erection of the necessary buildings and plant.We are advised that it is unlikely that farmers&apos; societies could undertake with advantage the manufacture of dried or condensed milk.    There is, however, a considerable field for the extension of milk collecting depots and cheese factories on a co-operative basis and also for such enter-prises as co-operative bacon factories and farmers&apos; auction marts.In the case of the larger, enterprises involving loans of more than  5,000 re think that the machinery of the Trade Facilities Aot might be vised, but for smaller schemes we recommend that loans should be made direct from the Ministry of Agriculture on similar terms to the loans granted by the Trade Facilities Committee.We understand that the sum which would probably be required during the present financial year could be provided either out of savings on the Ministry of Agriculture Vote or from the Civil Contingencies Fund, and that a Supplementary Estimate would not be necessary.,We recommend that the Ministry of Agriculture should be authorised to make loans for this purpose up to an amount not exceeding  200,000 in all, and that the details should be settled by the Ministry of Agriculture in consultation with tha Treasury.
AGRICDL- 8.    We recommend that the registration of agreements1^553. reached by the existing Conciliation Committees should bemade compulsory.RELIEF OF 9.    The Tribunal&apos;s recommendation on this matter willW^of&amp;M.   be considered by the Unemploymant Committee of the Cabinet,LOCAL   &apos; 10.     The Secretary for Scotland has under considerationafflis-TRAT7VE the question of the resuscitation of the County AgriculturalISjHTJERY.Committees in Scotland. AGRICUL- 11...     In paragraph 21 of their Report, the Tribunall&apos;(T6N0MY recommend that research work in the direction of testingnew systems of farm management, particularly as regards the maintenance of live stock ass&amp;-arable land should be extended.   We have been unable to explorethis matter fully in the time at our disposal and we recommend that the matter should be considered by a joint committee of officers of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Board of Agriculture for Scotland.Signed on behalf of the committee.
