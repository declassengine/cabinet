TRADE   BOARDS   BILL.2 memorandum BY THE.....MINISTER OF LABOUR.pet      1.      A Committee of the Cabinet, of which the Lord Chancellor (23)   was Chairman, has considered the Government^ policy in relation to Trade Boards.   They decided that the Report of the Cave Committee, appointed by the late Government, should be adopted and that a Bill should be introduced and if possible passed during the present Session to give effect to that Report,   The Report of the Cabinet Sub-Committee has received the approval of the Cabinet, and the announcement in the Eing&apos;s Speech   of legislation to amend the Trade Boards Acts followed that decision 2.        I now circulate, for the consideration of the Home Affairs Committee, a Draft Bill prepared upon the lines approved by the Cabinet.   I am anxious that the Bill and the attached memorandum should be considered at the first meeting of the Home Affairs Committee after the Recess,3,        The memorandum describes in general terms the existing Trade Board Acts and the principal modifications which were recommended in the unanimous Report of the Committee of Enquiry (April, 1922) of which Lord Cave was Chairman.   With the exceptions (of secondary importance) indicated in the memorandum3 the Draft Bill follows the recommendations of Lord Cave&apos;s Committee of Enquiry,4.        I should add here on the general form of the Bill thatit repeals the existing Acts and substitutes a consolidationand amendment of those Acts.   The Act of 1918 contains a numberof amendments of the Act of 1909, and since radical amendmentof both the existing Acts is required, a new consolidating Act \seems to be inevitable in order to avoid the creation of a complicated body of legislation.(Initialled)   M.B. March, 1923,this document IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC&apos;. MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,CABINET.
M E M- 0 R A N D TJ M.1.        The Trade Boards Act of 1909 provided that the Act could he applied to trades In which ws.ges were exceptionally low. The 1918 Act amended this provision so that it became possible to apply the Acts to trades In which there is no adequate machinery for the effective regulation of wages throughout the trade, and in which, having regard to the rates of wages prevailing In the trade or any part of the trade, it seems expedient to apply the Acts to the trade.   In both cases a statutory enquiry as to the necessity or otherwise of the application would be held if it were insisted upon by objectors.2.        A Trade Board consists of some 20 representatives of employers and an equal number of representatives of workpeople in the trade, together with three independent persons appointed by the Minister, of whom one is directed to act as Chairman. The&apos; Boards have the duty of fixing minimum time rates of wages, and they may fix piece rates and special rates for particular classes (e.g.learners, improvers, foremen).   Any such rate can be &quot;fixed&quot; by the Trade Board by a bare majority.   The Appointed Members if they cannot obtain agreement between the employers and work-people, decide the matter by voting with one side or the other. The rates so fixed are submitted tc the Minister of Labour for confirmation or rejection, and when confirmed they become the minimum rates which may be paid in the trade concerned to work-people of the class to which the rates apply. The payment of these minimum rates is enforced by the right of workpeople to sue their employers for the amount by which their wages fall below the Trade Board minimum; by the inspection of employers&apos; records by a staff of some 24 Inspectors under the Ministry of Labour, and by criminal or civil proceedings taken against defaulting employers at the instance of the Minister of Labour.
3.    Trade Boards have been established. ..in 40 trades, of whieh5 4 8 a list is attached.   In no ease was a statutory Enquiry pressed for and in faot in no case was one held.     Most of the existing Trade Boards deal with the trade with which they are concerned throughout Great Britain.    In several oases, however, separate Boards have been established for England and Uales and for Scotland respectively.     The Trade. Boards Acts contain provision for the formation of District Committees but only at the request of the Boards.     ffew Committees have been established and little effective use has been made of them.4,     The principal changes in the law embodied in the Iiraft bill are indicated In the follow in&amp; paragraphs.     Unless otherwise state.-, the changes were recommended by lord Cave&apos;s Committee of Enquiry.1. Changes designed to emphasize the ^anti-sweating&apos;&apos; principle as the main basis of Trade Board policy,(I) the grounds for applying the Act to a new trade will be :-(a) that wages are unduly low as compared with those in other employments;(b) that no adequate machinery exists for the effective regulation of wages throughout the trade (Clause I (i)).The emphasis is thus laid upon low wages; the provision regardingorganisation is required, to prevent the application of theActs to fully organised trades in which wages may at anytime be exceedingly low.(II) The power of a Trade Board to fix minimum rates by a bare majority is confined to rates fixed with reference to the lowest grade of fully experienced adult workers; to rates for any class of ancillary, workers or for any class of learners or workers not fully experienced; and to rates for workers employed under exceptional conditions (Clause 3 (1)).   Piece price lists for homeworkers also fall in this oltwse of rates.     Minimum rates of these kinds (General Minimum Hates) will be enforceable by Inspection/and
and by criminal or civil proceedings in the Courts 549 aa under the existing Aots (Glauses 6 and 19 ^i)KMinimum rates for all other classes of workpeople (and piece price-lists for any of the workpeople in the trade, except homeworkers) can he fixed only if a majority of both sides of the Board are in agreement, the Appointed Members not voting at all,     (Clause 7 and Third Schedule). Minimum rates of this kind (Grade minimum rates) will be enforceable only by civil aotion.taken by or on behalf of the individual workman (Clause 8); the Minister of labour will have no power to intervene to obtain payment of the minimum rate.    This last point is, in aocordance with a Cabinet decision, a departure from the reeomraenda-tions of Lord Oave&apos;s Committee of Enquiry, B. Changes designed to prevent ill-oonsidered use of the Aot, to render the Aot adaptable to the needs of particular trades and generally to secure smooth administration.(I) The Act cannot be applied to a fresh trade, or its applioatlon be suspended or withdrawn, without a public enquiry being first held into the matter (Clause 1 and First Schedule 4 (al); (ii) The Minister of Labour is empowered to set up District committees under existing Trade Boards and &apos;to determine the powers of suoh Committees.   Further, the Minister of Labour is explicitly empowered to form a Trade Board for any defined district (Clause S).Both these changes are intended to ensure that the special needB of each important district in which a trade is carried on will be taken fully into account in settling minimum rates of wages;/(iii) the
(ill) the time which must elapse before minimi; rates can he changed is reduced (Fourth Schedule);(iv) a Trade Board is empowered to grant a permit of Exemption from a minimum time rate to work-people who are incapable by reason of infirmity (Clause 12 (2) ).   The grounds of exemption in the existing Aot are &quot;infirmity or physical injury&quot; and the words used in the Draft Bill cover the same ground.   They do not go so far as was suggested in the Report of Lord Oave&apos;s Committee of Enquiry, where it is proposed that workers who ore merely &quot;slow&quot; should be entitled to exemption. It is believed that the words used in the Draft Bill will provide for every necessary case without opening a door to deliberate evasion of the Act;(v) Provision is mode to enable the Minister of Labour to determine which Trade Board1s rate shall operate throughout ah establishment to which,, in the absence of such a determination, the rates fixed by more than one Trade Board would apply (Clause 13);CORRECTION TO MEMORANDUM CP.175 (23) - MEMORANDUM BY-&quot;      THE MINISTER OF LABOUR ^OH THE TRADE BOARDS BILL.iatur e&quot;5.   In addition there is one point of a more general hould nature whioh was not considered by the Cave Committee,^ but which should now be brought, to the attention of the Home Affairs Committee.     The scope of the Bill.&quot;front-tnori ou -craaes&quot;.   This means that Agriculture, not being a trade, and certain of the ill-paid professions, such as Acting, would be automatically excluded from the terms of the Bill.     Accordingly,/ifPage 5, paragraph 5 should commence aa follows:-
(iii) the time which must elapse before minimum^ rates can be changed is reduced (fourth Schedule);(iv) a Trade Board is empowered to grant a Permit of Exemption from a minimum time rate to work-people who are incapable by reason of infirmity (Clause 12 (2) ).   The grounda of exemption in the existing Act are &quot;infirmity or physical injury&quot; and the words used in the Draft Bill cover the same ground.   They do not go so far as was suggested in the Eeport of Lord Cave&apos;s Committee of Enquiry, where it ia proposed that workers who are merely &quot;slow&quot; 3hould be entitled to exemption. It is believed that the words used in the Draft Bill will provide for every necessary ease without opening a door to deliberate evasion of the Act;(v) Provision ia made to enable the Minister of Labour to determine which Trade Board&apos;s rate shall operate throughout ah establishment to which,, in the absence of such a determination, the rates fixed by more than one Trade Board would apply (Clause 13);(vi) provision i3 made for the settlement of difficult demarcation questions by an Umpire, (Clause 22).   At present this troublesome natter can be settled only upon an action in the Court3,5, In addition tiaere are two* points of s more general naturey y ywhich were noVconsidered by the Cave ComtMttee, but which should now bejbjpbught to thayjfttention of bmjtomsz.. AffMrj,-Committee. A,,xTa&apos;&apos;e soope of the Bill.     ^M^VWU.   Q^J)Both the existing Acts and the amending Bill are confined to &quot;trades&quot;.   This means that Agriculture, not being a trade, end certain of the ill-paid professions, such as Acting, would be automatically excluded from the terms of the Bill.     Accordingly,/if
if amendments to include either agriculture or one of the professions vero moved they would ha out of order.   The. Liinister holds that this is right and he does not think tho Trade Board policy or machinery is properly applicable either to low-paid professions or to agriculture.   The answer.of the Prime Minister to the.&apos;Agricultural Deputation on March 16th accords with this view.   It is, however, probable that tho Labour Party may press for the inclusion of agriculture, and, as the whole agricultural situation has formed the subject of a special enquiry by a Cabinet Sub-Oommittac&apos;, tho point becomes one which should bo brought to tho attention of tho Homo Affairs Committee.
