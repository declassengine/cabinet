A oopy of the Agenda of the Session is attached.Mr. Betterton will be given the following instructions with regard to the Agenda unless oblation is raised. It has proved impossible on the present occasion for the International Labour Committee to disouBS all the Items on the Agenda, but in every case the Department or Departments immediately concerned have been consulted. Some consultation has also taken place with the Dominion representatives In London as to the items on the Agenda whioh affect Imperial interests,It em 1. Approval of the Minutes of the Seventeenth &quot;Session.The former representative of the Government has asked for certain corrections on the Minutes In question.Item S.   The Directors Report.The report contains 4 substantive proposals -EIGHTEENTH SESSION Of IBB GOVERNING BODY 5Qgg IliSMaifllOKJlh LABOUR oemob.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTRY OF LABOUR.As stated In 0*2* 168 ( 3), Mr. Betterton,IHSTRUOTIOKSom,     1     -
(a) To postpone the Fifth Session of the International Labour Conference, due to be held dn the 18th October next, until the 20th Kay, 1984.This proposal, while acceptable on it a merits, on grounds of economy and otherwise, Involves a technical breach of the provision of the Treaty which requires Conferences to be held at least annually.   It should therefore receive the general concurrence of the parties of the Treaty and not merely of Members of the Governing Body.   Kr,Betterton has accordingly been instructed only to agree to the post-ponement on condition that the Office Immediately brings the matter to the notice of all the Members of the International Labour organisation and that no substantial number of States signify dissent within a reasonable period to be fixed by the Governing Body (aay a fortnight).(b)Meeting of Sub--Comtulttee on Deck Cargoes.Mr. Betterton will not oppose the proposal that this Committee should meet on the 15th May, but he will intimate to the Governing Body that, unless the meeting Is adjourned for a further period, it is unlikely that the British Government will be in a position to express its views on the subject, as it is j doubtful whether the report of the Expert &apos; Committee, which is now advising the Board of Trade, will have been completely considered by the 15th Hay.(c)l;;Lxed Agricultural Committee.It is proposed that the first meeting of this Committee should take place on the 12th June, to consider professional and technical education in 4
agriculture, enquiries into agricultural oo-ioperative organisations, anthrax infection amongst flocks, etc,ar. Betterton will agree to this meeting taking place.(d)   Proposal of the KatloBal Labour Office of Uruguay,that a question concerning the wages of agricultural labour-era be placed on the Agenda of the next Conference.Mr. Betterton will be iastaruotecL to support the proposal of the Offioe that this subject should not be included in the Agenda, which la already overloaded. Item 5.   Estimates for 1924.A separate memorandum (CP,168/23) has already been considered by the Cabinet as to the action which Mr.Betterton should take in this matter, and he will proceed on the lines of the Cabinet decision of March 28th, 1923 which was as followss-After consideration of a Memorandum by the Minister/of Labour in regard to the budget of the International Labour. Office (Paper CP, 168(23)), the Cabinet agreed:-(a) That at a time when the British Government was taking drastic steps to ensure economy in every Government Department, it was essential to secure corresponding economy in the International Labour Offioe, which is to so large an extent dependent on contributions from the British Empire j(b) That at the forthcoming meetings of the Finance Committee and of the Governing Body of the Inter-national Labour -Office at Geneva, the Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Labour should be authorised not to agree to a budget for the Inter-national Labour Office exceeding 6,250,000 gold francs,
In carry-Ing oat these directions he will proceed in the manner approved by the Treasury in their-&apos; letter or 27th varoh, 1923., (not annexed).(a) Night work in bakeries;(b) Disinfection from Anthrax of wool, hair, bones, horns and hoofs.Mr, Betterton will bo instructed to support the inclusionon the Agenda of the 1923 Conference of the subject of dis-infeotion from Anthrax,    (It is known that the Indian Govern-ment representative will oppose the inclusion of this itembut an agreement to differ on this point has been arrivedat after consultation between the India Office and the HomeOffioe),As regards Night Work-in Bakeries,. Mr,Betterton will, without taking&apos; an active part in the discussion, support the proposal that the subject should be included in the Agenda but not at the risk of thereby excluding the consideration of Anthrax cFurther, subject to the concurrence of the Home Secretary. Mr. Betterton will urge that, in view of the presence at the next Conference of a number of factory inspectors, who will attend in connection with the consideration of the second item viz, &quot;General principles for the organisation of factory inspection&quot;, the opportunity should be taken of discussing generally the principles of tho prevention of industrial accidents,Item 6C Meeting of the Advisory Jtominittee.^rj^Ina^s^rialHygiene...Tho main business of this Committee is in connection with Anthrax, although proposals are made that it should discuss the manufacture and use of lead oxides, the means of discovering toxic gases in the atmosphere, and prophylaxis
of industrial ankylostomiasis.If the Governing Body decide to place Anthrax on the Agenda of the next Conference, Mr. Betterton will agree to this meeting talcing place.Item 7, Meeting of experts^on questions&apos;,concerning.&apos;the Disabled^IvT, Betterton still be instructed not to agree to the proposal for a meeting of the Committee of experts, but to propose that the Disablement Service of the International Labour Offioe should itself make the investigation proposed, the results of the enquiry being submitted to the Governing Body before publication!.Item       Report of the Committee on Standing Orders.MvAlA P--0t th  Standing Order a of the Governing Body-Certain drafting amendments, which need not he specified here, will be proposed by MrJietterton for the consideration of the Governing Body.Item 9. Report of the Building Sub&quot;Goflimlttee.,If the Governing Body accepted a substantial reduction in the Estimates for 1924, with a consequent reduction of staff, it might be feasible to obtain a measure of support for re-opening the question of erecting new promises for the International Labour Office,   .The possibility of renting the existing premises for a farther period of five years, and carrying out certain structural alterations and repairs, might perhaps be again explored.   If no substantial reduction of staff is approved by the Governing Body, Ir,Betterton will still indicate that reconsideration of the building programme is the course which the British Government would still regard as proper and as still remaining open as far as they are concerned.   It is anticipated however, that the Governing Body, as a whole, may consider that they are pledged by their predecessors&apos; votes and action, and we should deprecate the
impression toeing formed that the British Government wore determined at all oosts to recede from tho vote, whioh they gave at the Assembly of the Loague in September last, to expend three million franos upon a new building, through the British Representative at the League, Col, J., Ward,   A certain latitude must therefore be allowed to Mr- Betterton as to the extent to whioh, once having registered the view of the British Government that tho matter is still open, he presses it further.In any oaso, when Parliamentary Seoretary, the Minister of Labour got tho amount of tho proposed expenditure reduced to 2-g- million francs   and on Mr. !Vatson&apos;s report it should be possible to reduce this further.Item 10,   Relations between the International Labour Offioe and the Inte&quot;rnationaT&quot;Maritiaa Committee.It is understood that tho Employers&apos; representative onthe Governing Body is in consultation with the ShippingFederation, with a view to ascertaining whether the proposeddemarcation of duties between the two bodies is acceptable.Unless it is represented by British Shipping interests thata more precise definition of duties is necessary, Mr. Bettertonwill raise no objection to the agreement come to between thetwo bodies.Item 11.     Late and place of the next Session.The Office proposes that the next meeting of the Governing Body should be held on the 10th July.     provided that che Budget   is   definitively  adopted at the ooming Session, there is no objection to this course, If, however it is adjourned for further consideration at a subsequent Session, it may be necessary, in order to meet the convenience of the Financial Supervisory Commission of the League of nations, that the meeting should take place before the date now
proposed by the International Labour Office, in order that the Budget, with the comments of the Financial Supervisory Commission, may be circulated to Members of the League of Nations within the prescribed period, Mr.Betterton will draw attention to this point. Supplementary Agenda. .Item 1.   Conference of Labour Statisticians.Mr, Betterton will support the proposed meeting of statisticians, but will ask the Governing Body to estab-lish more precisely the Agenda of the meeting.   He will urge that It is desirable that the statisticians should,, In the first place, bearing In mind the limitations of finance, agree as to what information can usefully be collected csa an international basis, and consider, only as a secondary factor, how far that basis can be made uniform.Item 2,   Proposed subsidy for the Technical and T     &apos;       S* ct e&quot;ntifTo&quot;*:t rl s tTtut 6&apos;&apos; of Fro a the sis andMr* Bettorton will oppose, In view of the present financial difficulties, the proposal of the office to grant in 1924 a subsidy of 10,000 Swiss francs to the Technical and Scientific Institute of Prosthesis and Surgical Apparatus.Item 3,   Report of the Salaries Adjustment Committee.This report is to be submitted to the next meeting of the Governing Body, as regards the staff of the Inter-national Labour Office, and the next meeting of the Council of the League as regards the staff of the League Secretariat, etc.   The Treasury are not satisfied with the proposals of the Salaries Adjustment Con. ittes, and desire that these may be referred back&apos; to the Supervisory
Committee for farther consideration in the light of certain criticisms which will be offered by the British Representative on the Council of the League, and which it is expected that Mr0Betterton will also.9be in a position to present to the Finance Committee of the Governing Body.Ministry of Labour,March 29th, 1923, .
