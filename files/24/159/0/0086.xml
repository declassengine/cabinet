m..........bih m tii* Ttn-rr w wr -ftr-&quot;CABINET. .   mBRXSKTOH DIAMOND FACTORY.644Further memorandum hy the Minister of Labour.(1)   My colleagues will remember that this matter was under discussion at the Cabinet on March Slst; and stood over in order that I might obtain further information on two or three points raised, namely,-(1)   As to the prospects of the Factory; and in particular whether any portion of the  250,000 new money was to be used for retiring the  300,000 notes outstanding.(ti)   Whether it would be possible to arrange with the Rough Diamond Syndicate for a regular supply of rough diamonds; or that a certain number of orders for the cutting of diamonds should in future be guaranteed to tho Factory.(2)   Since March 21st I have had interviews with Sir Robert Kindersley, the Chairman of the Trade Facilities Committee, who had investigated the proposals on the financial side; with Messrs. Sohryvar and Rozelaar, the Dutch Managing-Directors of the Factory; and lastly with Sir Lionel Philips of the Rough Diamond Syndicate, and with Mr. Breitmeyer, who is the biggest dealer in the Rough Diamond Trade.(3) Shortly, the results of the interviews were as follows:-(a) Sir Robert Kindersley was clear that no portion of the new money now to be put up
( 160,000,  by Government p-uarantee and  100,000 by Mr. Lewis), was to be used to retire the  300,000 of notes.    So far as the  150,000 to be  - guaranteed by the Government was concerned, this would be secured by a specific first charge on all the buildings and machinery valued at, say  70,000 and a floating Debenture- charge on the undertaking, including rough and cut diamonds, for the balance.   The Government should be protected -(i) By nominating one or two Directors on the Board;(ii) By provision for a continuous audit by a Government auditor; and(iii) By the right to call for a repayment of their debenture, if at any time there was an ascer-tained loss of, say,  50,000.(b) So far as the Dutch Managers are concerned they expressed themselves as fully satisfied with regard to the efficiency of the workmen at Brighton; also that, provided working capital es proposed were available, the workshops would pay.   They had been in the Diamond Trade for many year3 before coming to Brighton, and their customers in America and elsewhere regarded the Brighton. Diamond products,especially the large stones, as fully equal to the Amsterdam products,(c) Sir Lional Philips and. iir, Breitmeyer said that they would give an assurance that no obstacle would be placed in the way of the Factory getting rough diamonds in fair competition with other buyers, but they
did not &quot;place diamond cutting on commission. They only sold the diamonds outright.   Further, they said that they did not oppose the Brighton Diamond Factory, but would be glad if It could be continued; and that if the security were reasonably arranged, the-Government would be well advised to&apos; help the Factory to carry on, if only for a period.(4)     It may be worth while mentioning that the-king * s   Roll National Council and Earl Haig, as their Chairman, have passed a strong resolution in favour of the Government giving assistance to maintain the Factory;    and a letter has been received from Lord Stamfordham on behalf of His Majesty   the King to the same effect.-(5)     It has been suggested that even If no Government assistance is forthcoming, Messrs, Lewis and Marks may oarry on the Factory on their own account, and that if it is a paying proposal they would probably do so;    but all the evidence J have is to the contrary\ and in any case it is clear that if Messrs, Lewis and Marks are to run the Factory on purely commercial lines, there is no guarantee that they will continue to employ the disabled men,.I may add that I have received, within the last day or two-, direct information that, unless
(Initialled) Co&apos; A. M, 3.Ministry of Labour, April   9th, 1923.the Government does take some definite action within tho course of the next few days, the Dutch Managers, who aro the hack-bone of tho business, will throw the. whole matter up and return to Amsterdam on or about the 15th April.(6)   In conclusion, .1 press strongly, as I did in my last memorandum(a) That a short Bill, should be introduced, allowing a Government guarantee to the extent of  150,000, on the conditions already worked out by Sir fiobert Einderslay, and in particular that none but ex-Serviee men be employed as operatives at the Factory. This latter condition, should prevent suoha precedent becoming dangerous.(b) I should prefer that the Government should support such a Bill; but if this was thought undesirable, the Whips might be taken off, and tho Bill left to the free Vote of the House,
