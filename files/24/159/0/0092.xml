(THIS DOCUMENT IS tW PROPERTY OP ^IS BRITANNIC -MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).CABINET. COMMITTEE OF i HOME AFFAIRS.  ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE BILL Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor-This Bill in large part deals with technics 1,though by no weens unimportant, matters connected, with the administration of justice, but two of its clauses, namely 1 and 2, raise important questions of general interest.Clause 1 is based substantially on a re-commendation contained in the Majority Report of a Committee appointed by the late Lord Chancellor in  ay, 1922, to consider &quot;what re-arrangements of the circuits of the judges can be effected so as to promote economy and the greater despatch of the business of the Nigh Court&quot;.     This Committee, rhich was presided over by !&apos;r. Justice S--ift, reported in February of this year, and its Report is-published as Command Paper 1831*     The clause gives power to the lord Chief Justice with the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor to dispense (with a vie&quot; to the saving, of expense and judicial time) with the holding of assizes on the occasion of any particular circuit, at any place in rfeich it appears that there Is on that occasion no $substantial amount of business to be transacted,     The clause does not authorise the permanent abolition of any assize, but merely the suspension of assizes from time to time as occasion requires,,Clause 2 is intended to remove the dissatisfaction and difficulties caused by s,2 of the Administration of Justice,Act; 1920, on which the right to a trial by jury in civil cases in the High Court now depends,.     Towards the end of the vnr it was foundjlCRET. i CP. 192(23).
necessary, 0&apos;&quot;ing to the difficulty of providing juries, to restrict considerably the right to trial by jury in the High Court, and this ras done by tf-s Juries Act, 1918.   . The right was to some extent restored by s.2 of the Act of 1920, but that section has been much criticised as restricting unduly the right to a jury, and, by the legal profession, as being obscure in its terms.   The present clause in the main reproduces the position as it was before the Act of 1918 r;as passed, subject to the exception that trial without a jury may be ordered by the court if in the opinion of the court &quot;the cause is more fit to be tried without a jury&quot;, but an absolute rifht to trial with a jury is preserved in all cases in which it nor exists.Of the remainder of the clauses, some are. proposed in order to give effect to recommendations made by a Committee(of which Mr- Tom1in, F.C. was Chairman) to consider what changes were desirable in connection with Supreme Court offices;   some deal with difficulties onfl anomalies -rhi.ch have come to light in the course of the preparation of tho Pill to consolidate the Judicature Acts and which if not removed by legislation will prevent the production of a really satisfactory Consolidation Bill;    others make amendments intended to effect economies or substantial improvements in the administration of justice in civil oases.It would;-appear unnecessary to deal with each clause at length, but the followi.rg may be specially referred to:-Clause 3, standardising the qualifications for appointment to ths more important offices in the Supreme Court, as recommended by the Tomlin Committee.-     The exist-ing qualifications present indefensible variations, and in some cases the law nov; requires no qualification at all:
Clause 4, plvlntr to officers of the Supreme Courtexercising judicial functions (such as Masters and Official Referees) the ordinary judicial tenure during good behaviour^, and to other officials of the Supreme Court the ordinary civil service tenure durin? pleasure:Clause 11. simplifying and goneralising the power ofmaking rules for the Supreme Court.     At present this power depends on a vast number of statutory enactments which, are in a confused and unintelligibl conditi on:Clause 15, transferring to the Board of Trade the duties now undertaken by tho Registrar of Bills of Sale in connection with tho registration of deeds of arrangement? nith. a view to effecting a reduction of expenditure.(Tntd- )     C.12th April, 1923,
