(/JriE3?DHEHT) BILL. (Memorandum by-tho Homo Secretary).Following the Debates in the House of Commons.on the deportations to Ireland Sir Kingsley Wood&apos;has;introduced a Bill to amend the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act, 1920, under which the deportation orders were made,--   So. 14 B of the Restoration of Order in Ireland Regulations provides that any Order made by the Secretary of State (or the Secretary for Scotland) shall in the case of any person who is not a subjeot of a State at war with His Majesty include express provision for the due consideration by an Advisory Committee of any representations he may make against the Order,     The Orders made against the persons now interned in Ireland contained a clause in pursuanoe of this part of the Regulations to the following effect:-&quot;If within seven days from the date on v/hich this Order is served on the said he shall submit to me any representationsagainst the provisions of this Order, euch representations will De referred to an advisory Committee appointed for the purpose of the above-mentioned Regulation and presided over by a person who holds or has held high judicial offioe, and will be duly considered by the Committee,,     If I am satisfied by the report of the said Committee that this Order may be revoked or varied without injury to the restoration and maiabonanoe of Order in Ireland I will revoke or vary this Order by a---furohtr Order in writing under my hand.    Failing such revocation or variation this Order shall remain in force.&quot;Sir Kingsley &apos;: ood&apos;s Eill embodies five points:-(l) that every Order shall be automatically brought under the review of an advisory Committee within 7 days of the date of the Order; (2) that every person against whom an Order is made shall have a right to appear before the Committee; (3) that unless the Committee confirm the Order it shall be discharged andvoid;^4) that until the Committee has confirmed the Order no British subject shallbe compelled to leave this country; (5) that the power to make orders shall be so limited as to expire in March 1924 unless further extended by Parliament.All these points arise out of the criticisms passed in Parliament on the recent exercise of the power of internment,As regards (l) and (2) it has been arranged that any internee who wishes to appear before the Committee will be allowed to do so.As regards the other points it is at present within the discretion of the Secretary of State (or Secretary for Scotland) to accept or rejeot the advice of the Advisory Committee but in practice a favourable report by an Advisory Committee would always be accepted.
;.It would I think be politic to give facilities for the Bill (subjeot to drafting points and the: amendment of substance mentioned below),,    By so doing, we should meet much of the criticism that our reoent action has aaroused and an amendment by Parliament of the Act under whioh we proceeded would: be valuable as reaffirming the existenoe of the powers under&apos; whioh we acted.     It could then hardly be argued that the reoent orders were ultra vires or made under a moribund statute,I have consulted the Lord Ghanoellor and the Attorney General in regard to the actual provisions of the Bill; and,we are agreed that they are acceptable exoeptas regards the provision.that &quot;the said Advisory Committee shall, within 1 days thereafter....... ^consider whether the Order    *f^,e(![ **sis just and reasonablej and unless upon suoh consideration^ ,;i,*the Advisory the Order Committee confirms the Order the said Order&apos;shall be discharged and void.&quot;t;;;^it /  would be better to provide that the Order should.be discharged if the Committee reported that the Order might be revoked or varied with-out injury to the restoration and maintenance of order,in Ireland and if the Bill.makes progress I should propose to move.an amendment to this effect., The interval of &quot;/days in whioh the Advisory Committee has. to consider the Order is too Bhort and thiB provision also will require amendment;   .Subjeot to&apos; this Pgint it would be a good thing if the Bill could be facilitated,.    It wouldjoe retrospective, in effect;   but-ltd passage would greatly strengthen our hands in. meeting oritioism of the draBtio but necessary action against the. Irish irregulars vhich.we have recently taken at the request and with the concurrence of the Free State government&apos;     &quot; \For these reasons I venture to hope that it may be found possible to provide the necessary time for consideration of the Bill,The Secretary for Scotland concurs in this memorandum.(INTD)     W^B,Home Officet9th April, 1923.190-1
