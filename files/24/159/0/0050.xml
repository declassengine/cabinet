Those of my colleagues who have at any time been concerned with the management of a business will recognise that the proposed letter does no more than set out the A B C of business procedure;   and my colleagues generally - whether they have been connected with private business or not &quot; will, I am sure, agree with me that as trustees for the taxpayer a Cabinet has at all events no less a degree of responsibility than the Board of a Company has for Its share-holders, and that at the present time there Is no issue so vital to the strength and well-being of this oountry as the reduction of expenditure to a point whioh will enable its oltizens to rebuild those financial reserves whioh proved the decisive factor In the winning of the -European TTar.S.B.TREASURY.

Treasury Chambers,Whitehall, S.Y/. March, 1923.Sir,I am directed by the lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury to acquaint you, for the information of the Secretary of State, that His Majesty&apos;s Government have had under careful review the procedure which is intended to ensure that the financial bearings and feasibility of all questions of policy should be comprehensively examined in advance between the Treasury and the Departments concerned so as to enable the business of the   Cabinet to be conducted with full knowle&amp;ge of all the relevant circumstances and considerations.Hie Majesty&apos;s Government are satisfied that the theory underlying the present system is sound and is in accordance with the accepted principle of business as ordinarily understood viz: that before a decision is invited or reached a proposal should have been subjected to careful and critical examination from the point of&apos; view of getting the best value for money and of making sure that thene is money available.The Treasury as the central and as the finance Department of Government Is charged (inter alia) with the responsibility both of taking a bird&apos;s eye view of the position and of providing financial ana economic advice and criticism.      And the theory of the existing procedure accordingly involves early, close, and,continuous consultation with the Treasury.
As, however, the practice of Departments does not always conform to the recognised theory, and to that extent public business Is deprived of the safeguards which every private business rightly insists upon as essential, His Majesty1s Government desire it bo be clearly understood throughout the Publio Service that for the future any proposal involving the Taxpayers&apos; money, whether in the form of direct expenditure or of Government; guarantees or otherwise, will only be admitted for decision (one way or the other) at the Cabinet after it has been examined in all its aspects between the Treasury and the Department from which the proposal emanates.I am, etc.The Permanent Under Secretary of State,
