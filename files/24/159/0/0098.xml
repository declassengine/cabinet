jj8 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).0i C P. E T. .-- C A B I NET,, 196(55).&apos;.   r&apos;ORK?/?NS11 CO^PENSATION. MEMORANDUM BY THE LORD CHANCELLOR.I desire to refer to the third point mentioned in the Home. Secretary1 s Memorandum on the above subject (CP. 190(23) ),The ^ome Secretary calls attention to a series of decisions in the Courts and in the House of Lords, by which it has been established that, where a workman in the course of his employment does an act which he is not employed to do, or \hich he is actually forbidden by law or regulations to do, and suffers injury in consequence of that act, the injury does not &quot;arise out of&quot; his   . employment so as to entitle him to compensation under the Act of 1906j   and he proposes that the Act should be amended in this respect.     Upon,this proposal I would make the following observationsi&apos; It is stated in the uemorandum that the effect of thedecisions is to &quot;practically nullify&quot; the intention of Parliament as embodied in the Act of 1906.   I do not understand this argument. The intention of Parliament can only be Inferred from the Yfords of the statute, and it is those vords that the Courts have interpreted,-and (it is to be presumed) have rightly Interpretedv   rhat is now desired by the ^&quot;orkmens 1 representatives is an alteration of the Act, so that it may conform to &quot;hat they think it ought to have said I    or meant.I&apos; - The alteration proposed vill be highly contentious.   TheI * employers are opposed to it, and they may - not unreasonably -I    say that they ought not to be compelled to compensate a workman I    for an accident caused by his exceeding or disobeying the express
terms of his employment, - that this is a peril added by the workman himself, and not. vi. thin the contemplation of the parties to the contract of employment.     Further, the Insurance Companies have fixed their premiums upon the footing of the law as establish-ed;   and if the lav: is altered, the premiums will no doubt have to be increased,.3* Tt is at least doubtful whether, on a longer view, theproposed change ^oulrl. be beneficial to the workmen;   for it would tend to weaken or undermine regulations rhich have been made for securing their safety, and so rould be likely to expose them to additional peril.     In the case of r,erbert v. Fox (L.R. 1916 A.C. 405) in ihich s shunter on a railway&apos;was injured while riding, contrary to the regulations cf the Company, on the buffer of a v?agon, and was held not entitled to compensation, Lord Atkinson, in giving judgment, said:-&quot;Rules such as this are, T think, made more to &quot;save the lives and limbs of workmen than the &quot;pockets of employers.    And, speaking entirely &quot;for myself, I may say that I think an ill service &quot;is done to the working classes in permitting such &quot;rules as these to be disregarded, and that It &quot;slackens discipline and engenders carelessness &quot;and rashness from which they themselves are the &quot;greatest sufferers&quot;.In the same case Lord Shaw said:-&quot;I may add that if it v^ere held that this was ..&quot;an accident arising out of the employment and that &quot;compensation was due, then in my humble opinion &quot;a real and damaging blow would have been delivered &quot;at the whole system of safeguards and protection &quot;under which in many industrial employments so much &quot;may be effected for the safety of life and. limb of &quot;the workers engaged&quot;.Similar observations are to be found in other cases.
4. The question now raised has been recently consideredby a strong Departmental Committee appointed by the late HomeSecretary to enquire into the system of compensation faurinjuries to workmen;   and that Committee by a majority of 10to 3 reported against the change now proposed.     Their Report(Command 8l6 of 1920&apos;page 23) dealt with the point as follows!&quot;&quot;Our attention has been directed to the decision of &quot;the Houso of Lords in May last in the case of Bourton v. &quot;Beauchamp &amp; Beauohamp (1920, W.M.,214, now reported, in &quot;1920 A.C. lOOl) whereby it was held following the earlier &quot;case in the House of Lords of the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire &quot;Railway Company v. Highley (1917, A.C. 3b&quot;2) , that where a &quot;workman was fatally injured in a coal mine whilst doing &quot;that which was neither lawful for his employers to employ &quot;hi$ to do nor lawful for him to do under his contract &quot;with his employers, the injury suffered by the wotikman in &quot;the course of that work was not an accident that arot;e &quot;out of and in the course of his employment,   It was argued &quot;in favour of the workman that the circumstances in i &quot;question brought him within section 1 (2) (c) of the&quot;Workmen&apos;6 Compensation Act of 1906; because his injury &quot;was attributable, putting it at the highest against him, &quot;tc his serious and wilful misconduot, and that pursuant &quot;to the provisions of that sub-section his dependants ought &quot;not to be deprived of the benefitg payable under the Act &quot;in case of his death, and we were invited to make a &quot;recommendation that words should be inserted in any amending &quot;Act giving the workman or his dependants the benefit of the &quot;last-mentioned sub-section in such circumstances.   We have &quot;considered all the decisions of the House of Lords and the &quot;Court of Appeal upon this subject,. which are to the effect &quot;that if a workman is doing work .that he is employed to do &quot;in an irregular or improper way he is not, in case of &quot;serious injury, disqualified from the benefits of the Act, &quot;but that if he. meets with an accident&apos; whilst doing some act &quot;which he was not employed to do, he cannot recover &quot;compensation,     The question to be decided is &apos;Was it part &quot;of the injured person&apos;s employment to hazard, to suffer, or &quot;to do that which caused his injury?   If yea; the accident &quot;arose out of his employment.   If nay, it did not.&apos;x   In &quot;cur opinion no change is-desirable in this respect&quot;.The three dissentient members of the Committee recommendedthat the words &quot;arising cut of and in the course of theemployment&quot; should be altered to &quot;arising in the course of theemployment&quot;;    but this recommendation was clearly inadjaiBS&amp;ble,and the Rome Secretary does not support it.I----:______________________x   Per Lord Sumner in Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway Co. v. Highley (1917) A.C. 352.
j?.     It appears to me that, unless an agreement can &quot;be made with the employers, the proposal to overrule the decision of the Committee on this point will meet with serious opposition and may endanger the whole Bill.(Intd.)     C.April l6th, 1923.- 4 -
