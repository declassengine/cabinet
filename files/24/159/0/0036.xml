RELATIONS BETWEEN THE COMMUNIST PARTY AMD THE RED INTERWATIOHAI Off LABOUR&apos; UllIONS. &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;-----The following declaration regarding a joint Committeeof Action has been made by the Executives of the Cominternand Profintern:1.     A joint committee of action will he formed by the Communist International and the Red International of Labour Unions for the promotion of their common activities against the attacks of capital, and for the leadership of the offensive and defensive struggles of the working classes against the bourgeoisie and its accomplices;   the name of this committee will be &apos;Committee of Action of the Communist International and the Red International of Labour Unions. 12.     This committee of aotion will be formed on the   -basis of equal representation.   The Executive Committee of the Communist International and the Exeoutive Bureau of the Red International of Labour Unions, will each appoint three representatives to the committee.3.     Besides this, joint committees of action can be appointed for conducting special campaigns, and common sittings of the Executive Committee of the Communist International and the Executive Bureau of the Red International of Labour Unions (or their presidiums) oan be held for the purpose of deciding on questions of particular importance, demanding joint action of both organisations.4.     The mutual relations of the Communist Parties and the revolutionary trade unions in the different countries are to be decided on the basis of the resolutions passed by the fourth congress of the Communist International and the second congress of the Red International of Labour Unions and by the concrete situation obtaining in the country in question.&quot;In view of tho above declaration interest attaches tothe following statement of relations between the CommunistParty of Great Britain and the British Bureau of the RedInternational of labour Unions:-&quot;Arising out of the decisions of the International Congresses of the Communist International and the Red&quot;international of Labour Unions and the decisions of the executive Committee and the Bureau of the Red International of Lsbour Unions that there should be the closest possible working arrangements between the two organisations, we affirm that:-.&quot;The Communist party is the organised vanguard of the working olass movement and has the first politicalclaim/
claim upon all its members irrespective of the     &quot; uu organisations in which they may work.   IT is UNDER-STOOD, IN TEIS CONNECTION, THAT THE PARTY D6ES NOTHING TO INTERFERE WITH THE WORK PARTY MEMBERS ARE DOING POR THE R.I.I.U.

PURTHER, THAT PARTY ASSISTANCE BE GIVEN THE BUREAU TO ENSURE THAT PARTY MEMBERS OCCUPY THE LEADING POSITIONS IN THE DISTRICT COMMITTEES OP THE R.I.L.U.&quot;The relationship of the Communist Party to the British Bureau is that of complementary organisations moving to a common goal.   To ensure effective co-operation there shall be reciprocal representation, one member of the British Bureau on the Executive Committee of the Party and one member of the Executive Committee of the Party on the Bureau, eaoh having a consultative voioe.&quot;In view of the close similarity of the work of the industrial department of the Party and the Bureau, the representatives of the Bureau to the Party Central Committee shall attend and participate in all discussions of the Central Industrial Committee of the Party.&quot;In order to ensure harmonious working between the Party and the Bureau and to secure Communist direction of Bureau activities the Party members in the Bureau should form a Communist fraction meeting regularly before Bureau meetings and in closest contact with the Party lead, through representatives on Party Central Committee,   similar arrangements should obtain locally between the R.I.L.U. committees and District Party Committees.&quot;It is the task of the British Bureau and the Communist Party to get the mass organisations affiliated to the R.I.L.U.   TO FORM WORKSHOP AND FACTORY COMMITTEES, AND ORGANISE MINORITY MOVEMENTS IN ALL INDUSTRIES.   It is the task of the Communists to secure the Communist leadership of the R.I.L.U.&quot;If thea^ organisational arrangements are carried through there oan be no question either of dual authority or lack of knowledge or consideration of the decisions of tho two organisations.   The R.I.L.U. is a mass organisation of workers inclusive of Communists and many other elements moving towards Communism.Tho R.I.L.U. is nearer to the Communist Party than any other organisation because it is pledged to revolutionary action and to work with the Communist International.   Nevertheless, because there is a distinction between the functions of the Party and those of the R.I.L.U.. as well as in its general make-up, it is necessary that the above arrangements be strictly adhered to.For the Central committee of the ComnuniBt Party.THOMAS BELL   (Political Secretary).

. 3 .301gflllations between the communist party and tee young communist -----leIgub. :The following statement on the above subject has been drawn up:&quot;Throughout these statutes, the object is to co-ordinate and. intertwine the activities of both organisations, so that everywhere there will exist a co-operation and unification of the forces of the Communist Movement as a whole.&quot;Eor this purpose, it is absolutely essential that on all actual units of both party and league, there shall exist mutual representation, a youth representative on Party organisations and vice-versa.&quot;Wherever a party organisation or unit exists and no such unit of the Young Communist league is in being, it is the bounden duty of all Party members to assist in the building up of such an organisation. This can be done by the allocation of the younger members of the party specifically to this task.&quot;On the other hand, wherever a unit of the youth organisation is in being and no such party unit existing.   It will be the task of the Young Communist league to allocate their older members for the purpose of building up such a body.&quot;Without prejudice to the principle of dual membership, it shall be obligatory upon all members of the Party under the age of El years to be a member of the Young Communist league.&quot;Prom 21 years to  4 years, membership of the Young Communist league or the Party shall be optional.&quot;Members of the Young communist league on reaching the age of 24 years shall be automatically transferred to the adult Party.   Those having held membership in the league for not less than 12 months being admitted to the Party without undergoing the probationary period.&quot;The Communist Party being sole guide and leaders of the revolutionary proletariat necessitates that the Young Communist League shell be politically subordinate, and shall wherever occasion presents itself forward the political interests of the Party.   On the other hand, the Young Communist League is organisationally autonomous.&quot;The Young Communist Lotgue as an organisation must participate in Party work, especially for the political campaign   of the adult Pfcrty.&quot;Members of the Young Communist League are admitted to all Party meetings to which ordinary PartyImembers are allowed , and vice-versa. &quot;The process of keeping down the age limit of theYoung/
Young Communist League and of transferring Its older members&apos;to the Communist pta-ty must be energetically pursued.&quot;The Party Press must actively co-operate in the work of the youth by definite allocation of space to be devoted exclusively to the affairs of the Youth. This measure is imperative, firstly in order to strengthen the press of the Youth, secondly to spread the P xty press among the young workers ana thirdly to acquaint the adult workers with the work and struggle df the Proletarian Youth.Por the Central CommitteeTHOMAS BELL   (political Secretary).Por tho E.C. of the Y.C.I. C. PEPPERS   (Secretary). 16th February, 1923.&quot;WE, COMMtJJH.,ToA leading member of the Communist Party has informedone of my correspondents that the Party has recently received a subsidy of just over  6,000, which is to last for twelve months:     with the money came instructionsregarding further propaganda, press and publications andthe women&apos;s movement:   the Executive intends to ask for afurther grant for &quot;The Workers&apos; Weekly&quot;.It is reported on the authority of a single informant,that J.T. Walton Hewbold, M.P., is receiving  250 a year from Moscow for expensesnin connection with propaganda&quot;.The following interesting suamary of the position atthe communist headquarters was made by a member of theExecutive on February 17th:&quot;The biggest difficulty I see at present is this, that the new form of organisation demands the work of a full time Executive Committee sitting at Headquarter^ and directing the whole work of the Party.   Lutt is almost wholly engrossed with the paper and is making a splendid job of it.   Pollitt and Leantn are at work all day and have about a thousand other jobs on hand. Party Training groups etc.,     Inkpin is wholly employed with the organisational side of it, Gallacher with tho Parliamentary and Municipal work, and may beleaving/
leaving the country at any moment.   I am here all flay and only free in evening.   My fear is that with every one so fully employed, that the central direction which is fundamentally essential to the Party cannot he given and meantime with seme of our members terrified to exercise their own judgment, the Commission&apos;s Report looming before them as infallible as &quot;PTe &quot;3;/.b&apos;Ce\i tfTere ia^juiit the danger^o^xnrulative . D^Ing&quot;a&quot;e1ft&quot;6&apos;ye3.   WfEh ja gooT Executive &apos;Committee eITting&quot;a.dd gifting well considered direction sent out, there wouldn&apos;t &apos;t be the same danger.   These I see as very real.   This week tU.Pollitt is out of a job&apos; and&apos;&quot;at the Executive Committee meeting last night he really was splendid and did bring clear thought to bear upon the subject under discussion-last week he was working all day and at the Executive Committee meeting was nearly sleeping.   Its quite impossible to do otherwise,   Dutt, Arnot and those whose work is in the Labour Research Department are simply handling all day material which helps them in their executive Committee work, but the point of view of the Pollitt, the Gallaoher, the Stewart type, is vitally important.&quot;The initial organisation of party Districts on the lines of the Commission Report is now complete and a good deal of progress has been made with local Party Committees and Area Groups.On February 22nd at the Kingsway Hall a dahate was held on the subject &quot;That communism would be a danger to the good of the people&quot;:   the debate was arranged by the Industrial League and Council and the speakers were Sir Ernest Benn and J.T. Walton Hewbold;.  the hall was filled to its utmost capacity, about three-quarters of the audience being communists.Tho positive side of the debate was admirably put by Sir Ernest Benn who confined himself, in tho main, to exposing the futility of communism as portrayed in literature purchased at 16, King Street and to searching Questions regarding present economic and social conditions in Russia.   lewbold failed to support his side of the debate but was nevertheless vociferously applauded by the packed audience:   by his side on the platform were TomBell/
Bell, .who prompted him on several points, Albert Inkpin, Harry Pollitt and Minnie Birch,   ilo vote was taken but as -the debate was broadcasted the communists considered it excellent propaganda.The Chief Constable of Birmingham informs me that J.T. Walton Newbold addressed a cornmunist meeting in Birmingham on February 25th and attracted an audience of about 600, the largest for many months at a Birmingham meeting of this kind.In connection with the women&apos;s section of the CommunistParty it has been decided to carry on an agitationalcampaign from March 4th-llth on the following lines&quot;(1)   To deal with starvation of women and children through(a) withdrawal of Grants to local Government boards for feeding of Infants and expectant mothers.!(b) low unemployment dole and gaps causing untold suffering to women and girls of the working class,(c) Suffering of married women owing to high cost of living and against wage reductions.To do this work effectively it is essential that small meetings bo held at labour Exchanges and other places wherever it is possible to get an audienoe of women leading up to a larger meeting or demonstration on the 11th of March,&quot;The workers1 Weekly&quot; will contain a special women&apos;s page for that week.Directions will be sent out by our national Committee with data for speakers, etc.&quot;4t the annual conference of the Scottish Labour party on February 24th the delegates from Mothsrws11 and St. Rollox were excluded on the ground that they were communists the chairman ruling was questioned but was upheld by a 4 to 1 majority.45,000 copies of &quot;The Workers&apos; Weekly&quot; were printed last week.   Search is being made for a successor to Palme Dutt and it is thought that Harry Pollitt may takeover/
over the editorship of the paper in about three months&apos; time..   Winteringham and Hargerisson of the &quot;Heralid&quot; are in almost daily communication with icing Street and last week assisted in the production of &quot;The Workers&apos; Weekly&quot;.The Chief Constable of Manchester informs me that at the Committee Meeting of the Unemployed at Whitworth Hall, Oponshaw, on February 9th it was stated that J. Brotherton had been elected Vice Chairman, and Ernest Woolley and James Wilkinson had beon elected members of the Committee of the Gorton Branch of the British legion; all three are Communists,     It was also said that there are four other Communists on this Cotrmittee, i.e., the Gorton Committee of the British legion.The communist, It. Purcell of Barrow, has been elected a member of the Central Executive of the Iron and Steel Trades Association:   Ward has been elected chairman of the Sheffield District Committee of the Amalgamated Engineering Union.MacManus will probably remain in Russia during the year of his term of office on the Executive of the Comintern.Horace Young is in Russia.THE RED INTERfci AT 1OilAl OF LABOUR UMIOHSInstructions regarding the work of national sections in connection with the International Propaganda Committee for revolutionary workers in the clothing industries, the text of which is similar to that quoted in previous reports regarding other trade unions has been sent to the British Bureau of the Red International of Labour Unions.V/iitkins has sent to Losovsky and to Reinhardt of the Central European Bureau, a report on the opposition of South Wales coal trimmers and tippers to the proposed extension of working hours.

Every effort must be   !-made to get Free Speech Defence Committees formed, tq revive those already existing, to form a United Front with the Socialist Sunday Schools. (We suggest that t the question be introduced into our Open Letter to the Socialist Sunday Schools) and to enlist the support openly or covertly of such pacifist liberals:;, as the Society of Friends and the Council for Civil Liberties andj of course, the&quot;Trade unions and the Labour parties, resolutions will be drawn up and submitted to the next Executive Committee meeting. We are also of opinion that the Party should be epproaohed on the matter which is of the utmost importance.&quot;Several steps have been taken with regard to theSocialist/Organising Bureau C.

Ane the material for the Conference whic^i will be published by that time, Comrade Young has made arrangements to attend the Conference as delegate from Bathnal Green Sohool, we are still continuing negotiations for a fraternal delegate...&quot;Publications.&quot;The Young Communist&quot; \.ill be a double number for Misroh... The current number has been completely sold out and reports from all over the country convince us that double the quantity (3,500) could easily have been sold (7,000)., It is therefore obviously necessary that e substantial increase in our order must be made...&quot;Two other publications have been put in hand: 1. the Anti-militarist,   These with an edition of 2,000 (for League and party members only) compelled to purchase one oop$ of this publication.   2.   The leaflets of the Int. B.C. with an edition of 10,000 copies.&quot;In the report of tho Organising Bureau it is stated that in view of the extensive registers being compiled and &quot;in the Intarost of safe-keeping of same a special room will be obtained.&quot;Tho next issue of &quot;The Young Cosimuniet&quot; is to be distributed in the London aroa by cycle couriers.The communist press in Lout;on has printed as aleaflet an anti-war manifesto signed by the ExecutiveCommittee of the Young Communist International:   copiesof this leaflet which contains the following passages havebeen sent to Germany;-&quot;You, British, Preach, Bslgian, Iutliun ana CKecho-Sloviikian young workers and soldiers -&quot;St up the arm of Imperialism of your bourgeoisie.&quot;Refuyc to become French Imperialism&apos;s hangmen of your own brothers,&quot;Fraternise/

Wherever proletarians unite for a life:.ot-daal-.h struggle against their imperialist bourgeoisie, you must be .in&quot;tho thick of the fighting.&quot; UNEMPLOYEDThere has beon comparatively little activity among theunemployed in London during the past week:   some of the hungermarchers still remain but 31 of the Scottish contingent leftCarrington House, D-vntford on February 27th and travelled northby the midnight train.The queen s S.jWvro officials of the. National unemployed workers&apos; Committee Movement have issuod a oircular in which theysummarise the position in regard to the hunger marchers.   Thefollowing extracts are taken from this document:.&quot;A pamphlet is to be published as soon as possible containing a summarised history of the Ifrroh since October 1922 up to the present time, so to obviate any reiteration we will not deal too lengthily with what has transpired during the March in this circular, but a few brief observations will not be out of place...&quot;The whole of the capitalist press feverishly seized every opportunity to misrepresent the marchers and to vilify the movement.   The Ministry of Labour deliberately manipulated the National Unemployment Insurance Scheme &amp;g&amp;lnst the Marchers in order to discourage them and to prevent others participating, but they failed in their sinister intentions.&quot;The Miaisiiry of Health have been equally prejudiced and anxious to check the Morch by endeavouring to coerce local authorities into treating the Msuohers as casuals in the localities where they have stayed, hoping that if only such treatment could be inflicted the spirit and determination/
determination of the Mf-ichors would he broken.&quot;THE MINISTRY OP HEALTH HAS SEEN HOPELESSLY BEATEN, AND THE MARCHERS STAND TRIUMPHANTLY OVER THEM,&quot;aIgo let v.1;,, not forget that amongst our own ranks we have hac a fraction of canting humbugs snd adventurers who. have been a continual source of trouble,1 often leading to dissipation of effort which had to be &apos;contended with.&quot;True, vo lu,ve not succeeded in forcing an interview with the Prime Minister, but remember v/e have not yet finished, NOT BY A HELL OP A LONG WAY.&quot;A store of knowledge and valuable experience has been gained from the UL-xoh .v$ till now to be utilised with added advantage for the next great advance after the lh:,i;ion.-.:l Conference has been held...&quot;The Chief Conytable of Birmingham has sent me thefollowing statement made by the leader of nine unemployedmarchers, who readied that Cloy on February  5th:   six ofthe men were on the way to Stafford:&quot;We are une Stafford contingent that left Birmingham about two weeks ago and we have also three Birainghcm men who marched to London with us from Coventry.   We ell broke away from the main body last Tuesday at Canning Town and decided to go back to our homes-&quot;   Ha condemned the leaders of the N.U.W.C-Movement for the manner in which they had received the mHrchers end said &quot;Iti ie all a bloody muddle.   I&quot;11 take good care that no other parson goes on the march if I can help it.   We have been living in condemned houses at Cunning Town, which were all rat-eaten and lousey an&apos;6 if we had stayed there much longer we would have all been found dsad&quot;.   He went on to say thati at 3 p.m. Tuesday, February EOth, 1923,   member of the Council of Action oame to him and -said &quot;If you are not satisfied with the conditions, here&apos;s 10/- and you can all go back to your hemos&quot;.     nI took the 10/*&quot;, said Middleton ^and I paid the tram fares fiom Canning Town *o Hyde Park and from Hyde Park we have walked all the way.   We came through Hendon, ,..i.ylesbur.y, Bioester, Bu.nbu.ry and Warwick.&quot;On February  1st a demonstration of about 1,000unemployed from Edmonton, Tottenham and ponders&quot; End marchedto the Edmonton Board of Guardians to urga the extension of out-door relief to single men and women:   a deputationheaded by Mr. Broad, M.P., was referred.tp the FinancialCommittee which mat on February 26th and advised thedaputation/
deputation to return on Ifcrch 7th when they would have had more time to consider the matter.Some 30 of the organised unemployed were present at a meeting held in the Quean&apos;a Hall by the National Constitutional Association on February 21st:   the speakers wore subjected to frequent interruptions but there was no disorder.IRISH RE VP WT 7. OH AR Y ACTIVITIES IN JREAg BRIiP&amp;IHThere have been few developments in the Irish situation in Great Britain during the week.   So far as the open side of the movement is concerned Art 0&apos;Brien and his henchmen.are doing their best to boom the Countess Markievios but are meeting with little success.     She has addressed one or &apos;two small private meetings, at the Minerva Cafe, Holborn, and 84, Blackfriars Road, and one small public gathering at the Morris Hall, Clapham, on tho 2,5th. Thomas 0&apos;Sullivan, who presided at the latter meeting, introduced her as the most romantic character in the history of Ireland.   On each occasion she made a comparatively mild speech:   she of course attacked the Free Lit ate Government which, she said, was only in existence through trickery and lies and would not last. &quot;Its strength i&quot;s derived from ex-Royal Irish Constabulary men, disbanded soldiers from the Irish Regiments, and corner boys wearing the colours of the first Republic.&quot; She vehemently condemned the executions and deplored the apathy of the Hierarchy which permitted them to take place.At the conclusion of her speech two men who claimed to be Englishmen, arose from the body of the hall - onesaid he represented the Young Communist league and theother the British socialist Party - and said theirorganisations/
organisations were prepared to throw in their lot withthe Irish in ordor to destroy British Imperialism.Art 0&apos;Brien tried recently to capture the GaelicAthletic Association out failed.   In the current issueof &quot;Eire&quot; the column devoted to English news contains the following:&quot;As the G.--.A. in London appears to have done nothing for the Republican cause as a body, and is in a position to do so, I hesitated about.publishing the announcement regarding its fixtures.&quot;&quot;If the London G./.A. cannot supply recruits for the Irish Republican Army, it certainly oan and should supply funds to maintain the Republic... &quot;There should therefore be no difficulty in placing the G.A.A. in the English capital in its proper position as an auxiliary to the Republican movement.&quot;Gael and Republican should continue to be synonymous terms, no matter what Mr. Daniel McCarthy, President of the G.A.A. and other little colonials in Ireland or in this oountry may think.&quot;Captures of men and munitions are still being madeat Liverpool, the latest case is that of Michael0&apos;Donoughue, who was found in possession of fiverevolvers, 500 rounds of ammunition, 19 detonators and11 oanvas ammunition carriers:   0&apos;Donoughue Is believed to be a former Officer in Command from the Tyneside.V/alsh, the former Transport Chief, who was arrested afew weeks ego, has now been sentenced to 5 years&apos; penal servitude.h considerable seizure of war material destined for the Republican forces in Ireland is reported to have been made by the New York police:   two persons, both Irishmen, were arrested and two others escaped:   there were 175 cases containing 200 rifles, 25 machine guns, many thousand of rounds of ammunition and a large number of hand grenades.
