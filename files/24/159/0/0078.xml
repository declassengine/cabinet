CABINET. iOSPECIAL REPORT ON   UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 88,    Period ended March 23, 1923.SUMMARY OF UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION.The number of persons registered at the Employment Exchanges as wholly unemployed at the 19th March was 1,260,544, a decrease of 42,245 on the previous week.POSITION IN CHIEF INDUSTRIES.COAL-MINING.The improvement in the Forest of Dean has continued. The position in the Midlands is satisfactory, but the flooding of mines in certain districts is responsible for some unemployment. The majority of the collieries in the Durham and South Yorkshire coalfields are now working full time, and immediate prospects are reported to be fairly good, although a number of workers remains unemployed. In the Lancashire district,:: employment and immediate prospects are good. Trade is brisk in Scotland and the situation at most centres is very satisfactory. There is still a good market in Wales, but difficulties as to shipment and the.attitude of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation towards non-union or other union labour continue to hamper production&apos;.IRON AND STEEL.In the Midlands employment continues slowly to improve, but progress is uncertain owing to the irregular supply of fuel and raw material. In Yorkshire and the North of England some improvement has occurred, but a shortage of scrap-metal arid uncertainty about prices is having a retarding effect. In Lancashire there has been a steady increase in activity. The position in Scotland remains unsettled. The improvement previously recorded in North Wales continues, and in South Wales a slight improvement is reported. -,i   ...SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.fin the South-Western Counties ship-repairing is slowly improving, but there is very little activity in constructional work. On the Tyne and Tees further improvement has recently occurred and is expected to continue. Although there is some activity at Barrow and among firms engaged in repair work on the Mersey, progress in constructional work is slow. Prospects on the Clyde are reported at most centres to be more encouraging. Depression continues in both North and South Wales.  Barrow has received1 one or two small contracts for new work.ENGINEERING. .In London and the Home Counties general engineering is very quiet, but there is some activity in the manufacture of wireless apparatus and motor-body building. In the South-Western Counties, employment has been provided for a fair number of men, and there is some evidence that conditions will improve after Easter. There is a slow but steady improvement at most general engineering centres in the Midlands,, and in the motor and cycle section trade is good: the sustained improvement-which;has been so marked a feature of this latter section, however, has now reached its zenith, and no further improvement is expected. In Yorkshire and the North of. England a very slight improvement has occurred, but the outlook
is still not encouraging. In Lancashire the position generally at most centres is becoming more favourable, but in the textile machinery section a number of operatives have been suspended. There has been no material change in Scotland, and there is no sign of immediate improvement. In Wales the general tone is optimistic and improvements are reported in some districts.TEXTILES.Cotton. The situation at most Lancashire mills is unsatisfactory, and production is being curtailed in the hope that prices will reach a remunerative level. Mills engaged on Egyptian cotton are busy. Unemployment among Yorkshire operatives continues to increase, and prospects are not good.Hosiery, Woollen and Worsted. Trade is quiet in the Midlands, pending seasonal demands. In Yorkshire trade has diminished and immediate prospects are indefinite.   The situation in Scotland is reported to be very dull.Silk. Depression continues in the Midlands, but the artificial silk industry is still fairly busy.Lace. The factories at Chard and Exeter have found temporary employment for a number of men. In the Midlands there has been some small improvement, and hopes are entertained of further development. Slight improvements in the plain net and curtain sections continue.Jute. This industry in Scotland is almost at a standstill, as the result of the trade dispute.BUILDING.Although there is evidence at most centres of seasonal activity, improvement generally is being retarded by the prospect of a national strike. Many employers are striving to complete contracts before the dispute materialises.BOOT AND SHOE.Trade is slack in the South-Western and Home Counties. In the Midlands, the improvements previously recorded at Leicester, Stafford, Worcester and Wellingborough continue, but the outlook at Northampton is not bright. The depression in Scotland continues.CLOTHING.The activity in wholesale dressmaking and tailoring in the South-Western and the Home Counties continues, and a general improvement is evident in the Midlands.POTTERY AND GLASS.The impending cancellation of existing wages agreements in the pottery industry will affect about 60,000 men and women, and trade, in the meantime, is practically stationary. The outlook in glass manufacture is poor at Smethwick and West Bromwich, but a slight improvement has occurred at Stourbridge. There has been a slight improvement among glass-bottle workers at Gateshead and Mexborough.TINPLATE.Activity in Wales continues, and prospects are bright. TRANSPORT.Trade at the London Docks continues to be quiet, but there is some activity at Ipswich. Slackness has occurred at Bristol and Avonmouth. On the North-East Coast, no decided improvement is expected until the end of April, when the timber season commences. Dockers are busy at Liverpool, especially in the coal export trade.   An improvement is reported at the South Wales Docks.C. A. ,MONTAGUE BARLOW, Ministry of Labour.
I. DETAILED UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES.1. General Percentage of Unemployment.[Note. Down to November 1920 the only percentages of unemployment available are those, derived from Trade Onion returns covering roughly 1,000,000 workers. From November 1920 percentages derived from the Unemployment Insurance Scheme, covering 11,000,000 to 12,000,000 workers, arealso available.]At the end of 		Trade Union	Unemployment		Percentage.

On the 13th August, 1920, the then Cabinet appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment. This Committee continued to function till October 1922. The present Government appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee on the 1st November, 1922.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the 8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit, extended the periods oi benefit and increased the contributions. As from November 1921 the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision for grants in respect of wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed a. special levy to provide for these grants. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, which operates as from the 6th April, 1922, amalgamates the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment Insurance
contributions, and extends until June 1923 the special periods during which &quot; uncovenanted &quot; benefit may be drawn. The authority to borrow money from the Treasury is increased to  30,000,000.Table showing amount paid out in Unemployment Benefit (including Benefit in respect of Dependants), and the Contributions during the period from the 8th November, 1920, to the 17th March, 1923. 1.

Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from, autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Report. At least 300,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 147,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits Scheme.(C.) Recent Extensions of Remedial Measures.Some of the measures comprised in (B) above are still in operation, e.g., past sanctions of grants by the Unemployed Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport. The Export Credits Scheme continues, and schemes approved under the Trade Facilities Act are in progress.In June 1922. the Unemployment Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport issued circular letters to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes for works of public utility, which, with assistance from State funds, might be undertaken for the relief of unemployment in their respective areas. Approved schemes are assisted by grants made on the same bases as heretofore. In the case of schemes assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee, particulars of grants already sanctioned are set out below.In September 1922, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries issued circular letters to County Councils (except the London County Council) and Drainage Authorities, inviting them to submit schemes of land drainage which, if approved, might be assisted on fundamentally the same conditions as those applicable in the T9747] r.
case of. schemes assisted last year. All applications were to be received in the case of Drainage Authorities on or before December 1, 1922, and in the case of County Councils (Agricultural Committees) on or before December 16, 1922. County Councils were also circulated with regard to schemes for the supply of water to farms, the conditions of assistance from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries remaining substantially the same as last winter, with the exception that the Ministry, instead of advancing the whole cost ot any scheme and recovering a proportion from the owners concerned, will make grants to cover part only of the total cost of each scheme. Further circulars, issued to County Councils and Drainage Authorities on the 5th and 6th December respectively, notified the extension of the date up to which applications might be received to the 13th January, 1923, and invited the submission of additional schemes. The time for receiving: applications was further extended provisionally to the 10th February, 1923. Particulars of grants sanctioned and of the number of men employed to date are shown below (see table 6).On the 30th November, 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, outlined the manner in which measures taken by the late Government would be continued and extended. The additional sums promised in extension of existing funds are set out below :  Unemployment Grants Committee (for grants on the basis of60 per cent, of Wages Bill)......... ...        600,000Land Drainage ... ... ... ... ...        170,000Afforestation ... ...        ... ... ... ...        100,000Acceleration of Government contracts Office of Works   ......... 375,000General Post Office ... ... 946,000-     1,321,000It was also then announced that guarantees under the Trade Facilities Act Scheme would be ma.de available up to  50,000,000 ( 25,000,000 extra); that the Export Credits Scheme would be extended if necessary; and that the Local Authorities concerned would be asked to co-operate in putting in hand the Manchester-Liverpool Road, which would involve an expenditure of about  3,000,000, half of it from the Road Fund.In December 1922, the Unemployment Grants Committee issued a further circular letter to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes suitable for assistance on the basis of 60 per cent, of the Wages Bill, i.e., works the cost of which is normally defrayed out of revenue and not by loan. The conditions under which grants may be sanctioned are substantially the same as those previously in force, except that in the case of Rural Districts the Committee have discretion to allow, where clearly necessary, a modification of the conditions regarding the giving of preference to 75 per cent, ex-service men and the engagement of labour through the Employment Exchanges.On the 12th December, 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, further announced that, in addition to the acceleration of contracts by the Post Office and Office of Works, previously described, the Admiralty would accelerate miscellaneous works to a total of about  365,000; whilst the Home Office would put in hand certain accelerated building work, together with repairs to buildings, including Police Stations.On the 13th December, 1922, the Forestry Commission issued a press notice to the effect that forestry grants were available for the relief of unemployment on the same general conditions as those applicable to grants made last winter. The sum of  100,000 referred to above is to be used partly for this purpose and partly for the purpose of relief schemes in Crown Forests and for additional work in the Commission^ forests by the Trade Facilities and Loans Guarantee Act, 1922 (Session 2), enacted on the 15th December, 1922, formal sanction was given for the increase of the aggregate capital amount of loans the principal or interest of which mav be guaranteed under the Trade Facilities Act, 1921, from  25,000,000 to  50,000,000.On the 15th February, 1923, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, announced an extension of  5,600,000 in the amount available for grants in respect -of approved road works by the Ministry of Transport.
