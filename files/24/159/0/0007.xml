Referred to    . Ccrr&apos;-&apos;:f.ee of Home Affairs[This Document is^the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]     49IMPOETATION OP CANADIAN BREEDING ANIMALS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I HAVE read the memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (CP. 100 (23)) as to the importation of Canadian breeding animals under &quot; The Importation of Animals Act, 1922.&quot;I have referred to the proceedings at the conference with Canadian Ministers held in October last, and can fully confirm what the Minister of Agriculture says in his memorandum as to the impression given to Mr. Fielding and Mr. Lapointe in the course of that conference by the present Minister of Health, viz., that he would be prepared to introduce an order under section 2, and to make it a Government matter.I am convinced that, if steps are not taken, first, to prepare an order as soon as possible, and, secondly, to treat it as a Government matter, in the event of the order being opposed in either House, there will be most bitter resentment on the part of the Government and people of Canada.Printed for the Cabinet.SECRET.\3CP. 107 (23).CABINET.DEVONSHIRE.Colonial Office,February 19, 1923.[9530]
