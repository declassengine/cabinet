UMMP.LGIMENT INSURANCE BILL.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;200MEMORANDUM.1,   The Bill makes provision for a further grant of uncovenanted benefit as from April 19th next.The Fourth Special Period of benefit is to be prolonged, so as to extend from End November, 128?,, to 17th October, 1923.   Luring the period as thus prolonged a total of 44 weens of benefit may be drawn, subject to the condition that when a person has received 22 weeks of benefit in the Fourth Special period, Ue.-. since the beginning of November 1922, a gap of two weeks will occur before ha becomes entitled to further benefit (Clause 1.).3?rom October 1923, the Bill provides that benefit years shall bo instituted, to run from inid-H)october of one year to mid-October of next year and that during the first benefit year from October, 1923, to October 1924, 26 weeks of benefit may be paid, either in respect of contributions or, if necessary, irrespective of the pay-ment of contributions.   For subsequent benefit years the maximum period of benefit will be 26 weeks payable only in respect of contributions (Clause 2).The 26 weeks of benefit within the first benefit year may be drawn without a break if payable in ro3peot of contributions, but if benefit is authorised irrespective of contributions a gap of three weeks will occur after 12 weeks of such benefit have   been drawn (Clause 2, proviso (2)).20   The Bill proposes to make permanent the additional benefits payable in respect of a wife (or invalid husband) and dependent children, which under existing legislation (Unemployment insurance Act 1922) are to continue only until the end of the &quot;deficiency period&quot; of the Unemployment Fund,     The rates of contribution after the end of the deficiency period are to be such as will be sufficient/to
to provide for these additional benefits, bat are not to exceed those set out in the First Sohedule to the Bill.    The State contribution after the and of the deficiency period is to bo the same as in the Unemployment Insurance Act 1920 viz. one-2 ^ ^ fourth of tho joint contributions of employers and employed instead of the present proportion of approximately one-third. (Clause 4j.3.    With a view to meeting certain anomalies the provisions of the principal Aot with regard to continuity of unemployment are amended.     The new rule proposed Is that benefit shall be payable for any three days or more of unemployment ooourring during any six consecutive days    not necessarily within one calendar week (Clause 5).4.     The rale which at present limits the right to benefit to one week of benefit for every six contributions paid is to be repealed.     With a view to securing administrative economies it is proposed instead that the maximum amount of benefit payable during a benefit year shall depend upon the average number of contributions paid during the throe preceding insuranoe years.     The scale of benefit payable i$ set out in the Second Schedule to the Bill.    As a transitional measure the scale is to be modified in favour of insured contributors during the first three years after the now rule comes into operation;   and special provision is also to be made to meet the case of new entrants at any time into insurance (Clause 6).5.   The Section of the principal Aot providing for the refund of the employed persons share of contributions (less benefit received) when he reaches the age of 60 is to be repealed subject to the payment of compensation to persons who are at present of the age. of 50 years or over (clause 7).6.   With a view to-oarrying out the recommendations made by/Lord
Lord Chelmsford (Juvenile Employment Inquiry, 1921) provision is also made with, regard to the exercise hy local EducationAuthorities of their powers of adopting a Choice ofEmployment Scheme tinder Section 107 of the Education Act,1921,     In order to prevent duplication of machinery, theexercise of those powers is made conditional on the Authoritiesundertaking the administration of unemployment benefit inrespodt of the juveniles concerned (clause 9),7e     Minor amendments are proposed in regard to theprovisions relating to -fa)   the crediting of ex-members of the Forces on their discharge with contii.buti.ons (Clause 8&apos;h(b) Blind persons in receipt of pensions (clause 10).(c) Ante-dating claims to benefit (clause 11).(d) Provisions as to Insurance Stamps (Clause 12).(e) Recovery of sums wrongly paid by way of benefit(Clause 13).(f) Adaptation   of Special schemes (Clause 14).\
