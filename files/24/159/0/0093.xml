Period ended April 6, 1923.SUMMARY OF UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION.The number of persons registered at the Employment Exchanges as wholly unemployed at the 3rd April was 1,284,593, an increase of 41,169 over the previousweek.POSITION IN CHIEF INDUSTRIES.COAL-MINING.The activity in the Forest of Dean continues, but the Bristol Collieries show no improvement. The satisfactory situation in the Midlands has been maintained. In the Yorkshire and Durham coalfields an improvement has occurred, and prospects for the immediate future are good. Employment in the Lancashire district remains good, and is slowly approaching the normal level. Although the demand in Wales is maintained, the dispute previously reported has resulted in decreased output.   The industry in Scotland continues to be exceedingly brisk.IRON AND STEEL.Yery little activity is manifest in the heavy iron and steel industries in the Midlands, but employment in the lighter branches of the trade has improved: there is still a shortage of raw material and of fuel. The position in Yorkshire and the North of England has improved. The activity in Lancashire has been maintained on the whole. The improvement in North Wales has been maintained, and in South Wales employment generally continues to be fairly satisfactory. A slight improvement is reported from Scotland.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.While there is evidence of increased activity at the smaller yards in the South-Western Counties, employment generally is below normal, especially at Southampton. A slight improvement has occurred on the Tyne and Tees, but the high prices prevailing in the iron and steel trade may retard further improve-ment. A slight improvement is recorded at Barrow. Ship-repair work is plentiful on the Mersey. In North Wales a slight improvement has also occurred, but in South Wales, apart from some activity at Swansea, the depression continues. In Scotland the position has not improved.ENGINEERING.Trade continues to be quiet at most centres in the Home Counties, but in some districts activity is evident. There is slow but steady improvement in the South-Western Counties, but employment is still much below normal. In the Midlands, a gradual increase of activity in the motor, cycle and general engineering sections continues. Unemployment is still very heavy in Yorkshire and the North of England, and the outlook is not promising. There are, however, some signs of a gradual improvement in trade. Motor-engineering in Lancashire continues to thrive, and general engineering is fairly busy, but the textile section has undergone a reaction from the position it occupied some months ago. The situation in Scotland and Wales is unchanged.
TEXTILES.Cotton. In Lancashire, the organised curtailment of output in the spinning section continues, and no appreciable improvement is expected until prices reach a remunerative level. In Yorkshire, output is also being reduced, and prospects are not encouraging.Hosiery, Woollen and Worsted. Trade continues to be quiet in the hosiery section in the Midlands, and no marked improvement is anticipated at present. Conditions in the woollen and worsted industry are worse, and the outlook is uncertain.Silk. A very slight improvement has occurred in the Midlands, and the artificial silk industry continues to be fairly busy.Lace. The position at Chard and Exeter is no longer favourable, and prospects of further work are remote. Apart from activity at Beeston (Notts.) in the curtain and plain net sections, the position in the Midlands is unchanged.Jute. The dispute in this industry at Dundee has caused practically every factory in the town to close.BUILDING.At most centres activity in decorative and repair work has been maintained, but the position is overshadowed by the impending strike.BOOT AND SHOE.Trade is quiet in the Home Counties, and employment is increasing at Norwich. The depression at Kingswood (Bristol) continues. Unemployment at Northampton and Kettering is increasing, and trade is quiet at Wellingborough. Orders are fairly evenly distributed at Leicester, and industry is in a fair state at Mansfield, Derby and Worcester.CLOTHING.The improvement in the dressmaking and wholesale-tailoring trades in the South-Western and Home Counties has been maintained, and activity continues in the Midlands.POTTERY AND GLASS.The present dispute in the pottery trade is preventing the possibility of any improvement, and the industry is practically at a standstill, pending a settlement of the wages question. The improvement in the glass-bottle industry at Mexborough has been maintained.TINPLATE.Employment in Wales continues to be fairly good.TRANSPORT.Work at the London Docks is quiet generally, but the improvement at Ipswich continues. Unemployment is increasing at Avonmouth. Conditions have slightly improved on the North-East Coast, and on the Lancashire coast a gradual improvement is occurring, While the slight improvement at Newport and Cardiff has not been maintained, the position at Swansea is better.C.

On the 13th August, 1920, the then Cabinet appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment. This Committee continued to function till October 1922. The present Government appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee on the: 1st November, 1922.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the 8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending: Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit, extended the periods of benefit and increased the contributions. As from November 1921 the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision for grants in respect -of wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed a special levy to provide for these grants. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, which operates as from the 6th April, 1922, amalgamates the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment Insurance
contributions, and extends until June 1923 the special periods during which &quot; uncovenanted &quot; benefit may be drawn. The authority to borrow money from the Treasury is increased to  30,000,000.Table showing amount paid out in Unemployment Benefit (including Benefit in respect of Dependants), and the Contributions during the period from the 8th November, 1920, to the 31st March, 1923. 1.

Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from, autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Report. At least 300,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 148,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits Scheme.(C.) Recent Extensions of Remedial Measures.Some of the measures comprised in (B) above are still in operation, e.g., past sanctions of grants by the Unemployed Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport. 4. The Export Credits Scheme continues, and schemes approved under the Trade Facilities Act are in progress.In June 1922, the Unemployment Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport issued circular letters to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes for works of public utility, which, with assistance from State funds, might be undertaken for the relief of unemployment in&apos; their respective areas. Approved schemes are assisted by grants.made on the same bases as heretofore. In the case of schemes assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee, particulars of grants already sanctioned are set out below.In September 1922, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries issued circular letters to County Councils (except the London County Council) and Drainage Authorities, inviting them to submit schemes of land drainage which, if approved, might be assisted on fundamentally the same conditions as those applicable in the [9818] b 3
ease of schemes, assisted last, year. All applications were to be received in the. case- of. Drainage; Authorities on or before December, 1, 1922, and in the case of County Councils (Agricultural Committees) on or before December 16, 1922. County Councils were also circulated with regard to schemes for the supply of water, to farms, the conditions of assistance from, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries remaining.substantially the same as last winter, with the exception that the Ministry, instead, of advancing, the whole cost ot any scheme and recovering a proportion from the owners concerned, will make grants to cover part, only of the total cost of each scheme. Further circulars, issued to County Councils and Drainage Authorities on.the 5th and 6th December respectively, notified, the extension of the date up to which applications might be received to the 13th January, 1923, and invited the submission of additional schemes. The time for receiving, applications was further extended provisionally to the 10th February, 1923. Particulars of grants sanctioned and of the number of men employed to date are shown below (see table 6),On the 30tb November, 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, outlined the manner in which measures taken by the late Government would be continued and extended. The additional sums promised in extension of existing funds are set out below :  Unemployment Grants Committee (for grants on the basis of60 per cent, of Wages Bill) ... ... ... ...        600,000Land Drainage ... ... ... ... ...        170,000Afforestation ... ... ... ...... ...        100,000Acceleration of Government contracts Office, of Works   ......... 375,000General Post Office ... ... 946,000-     1,321,000It was also then announced that guarantees&apos; under the Trade Facilities Act Scheme would be made available up to  50,000,000 ( 25,000,000 extra); that the Export. Credits Scheme would be extended if necessary; and that the Local Authorities concerned would be asked to co-operate in putting in hand the Manchester-Liverpool Road, which would involve an expenditure of about  3,000,000, half of it from the Road Fund:.In December 1922, the Unemployment Grants Committee issued&apos; a further circular letter to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes suitable for assistance on the basis of 60 per cent, of the Wages Bill, i.e., works the cost of which is normally defrayed out of revenue and not by loan. The conditions under which grants may be sanctioned are substantially the same as those previously in force, except that in the case of Rural Districts the Committee have discretion to allow,, where clearly necessary, a modification of the conditions regarding the giving of preference to 75 per cent, ex-service men and the engagement of labour through the Employment Exchanges..On the 12th December, 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, further announced that, in addition to the acceleration of contracts by the Post Office and Office of Works, previously described, the Admiralty would accelerate miscellaneous works to a total of about  365,000; whilst the Home Office would put in hand certain accelerated building work, together with repairs to buildings, including Police Stations.On the 13th December, 1922, the Forestry Commission issued a press notice to the effect that forestry grants were available for the relief of unemployment on the same general conditions as those applicable to grants made last winter. The sum of  100,000 referred to above is to be used partly for this purpose ancl partly for the purpose of relief schemes in Crown Forests and for additional work iii the Commission^ Forests   ^By the Trade Facilities and Loans Guarantee Act, 1922 (Session 2), enacted on the 15th December, 1922, formal sanction was given for the increase of the aggregate capital amount of loans the principal or interest of which may be guaranteed under the Trade Facilities Act, 1921, from  25,000,000 to  50,000,000.On the 15th February, 1923, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, announced an extension of  5,600,000 in the amount available for grants in respect of approved road works by the Ministry of Transport.
