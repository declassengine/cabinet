is DOCUMENT IS TEE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANHIG MAJESTY&apos;s GOVERNMENT,C RET. . 165 (25). 30 H.18. )CABINET,HOUSING SUBSIDY TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES.Memorandum by the Secretary for ScotlandaThe attached Memorandum, proposing that a somewhat increased subsidy should be granted to Scottish Local Authorities in respect of higher costs of construction, which. I originally circulated to the Committee on Housing Policy on March 19th, 1923, is now circulated for consideration by the Committee of Home Affairs.NOVAR.tish Office, hitehall, S.W.I.22nd March, 1923.
HOUSING   - PROPOSED SUBSIDY TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN SCOTLAND.Scottish Local Authorities have strongly represented that in fixing the amount of subsidy which the Government may undertake to pay under any future State-assisted housing scheme, regard must be had to the extra cost of building obtaining in Scotland.The Secretary for Scotland received a deputation composed of representatives of Scottish Local Authorities, large and small, burghal and county, at which the foregoing view was strongly pressed, the Local Authorities taking up the position that both from custom and for climatic reasons it was necessary to build, a house superior both in accommodation and construction to that being built in England.    The Secretary for Saotland was not satisfied that apart from the considerations mentioned with regard to superior accommodation and construction there-was justification for the assertion generally made that the cost of building per se must necessarily be greater in Scotland than in England,&quot; and he arranged that the expert officers representing Local Authorities 8ho-xLd meet expert officers representing the Board of Health in Edinburgh and go into the question of comparative costs in the two countries.That meeting has since taken place and the Local Authorities&apos; representatives submitted thereat figures showing that the type of four apartment house generally being erected in Scotland under the 1919 scheme&apos;would at present day prices cost  530 or  115 in excess of the estimate of the Ministry of Health for their A3 type of house, namely  415.That difference they accounted for as follows:-Increased accommodation......... 51.17.-.Sarking and felt............    8.-.-.Heavier roof timbering, hatchways, etc. 9. 3.-. Three coats plaster instead of twocoats.................. 6. - . - .Roughcasting,...............12.Extra plumber work............25. -.- .Plastering of scullery.........  . 3. -. -. 115,It will be seen that nearly half of the excess in cost is due to what is termed &quot;Increased accommodation&quot;, by which is meant greater superficial area, and greater cubic capacity.The Board-have used every endeavour to reduce the cost of building in Scotland and for that purpose&apos; have prepared plans of houses which conform more nearly with the English A3 type,  and have urged Local Authorities- to adopt them,  so far without success.It was felt by the Boards of Health Officers.that the type hitherto adopted in Scotland did not offer the best common basis for comparative purposes, and the cost of erecting in Scotland an A3 type house of the same size and construction/
construction and having the same fittings as in England was gone into. The Local Authority expert officers brought out the cost of £453.10/-, being 338.10/- in excess of the Ministry estimate of £415. The difference in cost was accounted for as follows:-

Sarking and felt on roof ............... 38. -.-.

Roughcasting ........................... 12. -.-.

Three coats plaster instead of two coasts.............................. 6. -.-.

Heavier timbering on roof.............. 6. -. -.

Extra external plumbing................ 3.10-.-.

Plastering walls of scullery ........... 3. -.-.

238.10.-.

The Local Authority officials claimed that in fixing the amount of the subsidy Scotland is entitled to claim an extra amount in respect of the whole of the expenditure.

The Secretary for Scotland is advised that, making full allowance for differences of climatic and other conditions, the whole of this extra expenditure claimed by the Local Authority officers is not warranted and that the most that can be justified in respect of the differences referred to is a sum of 223, made up of cost of -

Sarking and felt on roof............... £8. -.-.

Roughcasting............................ 12. -.-.

Plastering walls of scullery............ 3. -.-.

223. -.-.

With regard to the extra cost of three coats of plaster, this addition is one which is insisted upon by the operatives in Scotland who decline to put on two coats. The Secretary for Scotland is advised that there is no reason why the extra cost of plaster should be provided.

The Secretary for Scotland is of opinion having regard to the facts and figures set out above: 

(1) That no case can be made for asking for a larger subsidy for Scottish Local Authorities in respect of any excess of cost due to the "increased accommodation" in the type of house at present being erected in Scotland.

(2) That the Scottish Local Authorities have a case in so far as the increased cost is rendered necessary by climate conditions. In a type of house comparable with the English A3 type that increased cost amounts to £23.

The estimated deficit in respect of that sum equated over Twenty years is 38/-, and assuming that a flat rate if subsidy were fixed for England it would appear that an additional sum of £1 should be added to that flat rate of subsidy as a fair division of the additional annual burden which will be thrown on Scottish Local Authorities in consequence of what appears to be a necessary additional capital expenditure.


As an alternative method of producing the same result it is suggested that, instead of thia additional sum per year being added, the same annual rate of subsidy should be paid in hoth countries, but in Scotland it should be paid for a period of 25 years instead of 20.     The financial benefit is &quot;practically the same under htth alternatives.
