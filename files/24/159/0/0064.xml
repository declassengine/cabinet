DOC tosh T 13 TEE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAMIC     jf3 TY1S G OVER km eh T.. &quot;  &quot; 488CABINET.mental   treatmeht   bill,  1925. t .  k. copy mo. i9Ifefflopandum by the Minister of Health pn Clause 4 9f the Bill.1.     The Home Affairs dommittee at their last meeting were of opinion, that in the case of a person suffering from incipient mental disorder whom it is desired t6 place in an approved institution for temporary treatment without certification under the provisions of Clause 4 of the Bill, some additional safeguard was expedient where the patient was incapable of volition or was a minor.   I am anxious to meet the wish of the Committee., because *iy advisers inform me that the cases likely to benefit most under the machinery provided by Clause 4 are those who by reason of a sudden onset of mental derangement are in fact temporarily incapable of volition, and that unless this class can be provided for, Clause 4 will be of little practical use in dealing with the situation which it i3 designed to meet.2.     My colleagues will remember that the whole object of the Clause is to enable treatment to be given in these cases for a strictly limited period without the necessity of certification and the consequent infliction of the stigma of lunacy upon&apos; -patients whose mental disorder is, so far as can be seen, of a temporary nature only and amenable to treatment wholly dissociated from the lunacy laws.   At the present time no-person can receive into his care a lunatic or alleged lunatic (whether&apos; suffering from temporary dtsrangement or not) without-running the risk of a prosecution, unless all the formalities prescribed by the Lunacy Acts are first complied with.    These formalities Include, in addition to the two statutory medical certificates, a reception order made by a judicial authority. The powers of the judicial authority may, under the Acts, be exercised by a Justice of the Peace appointed annually by Justices of County and Quarter Sessions Boroughs out of their&apos; own body to exercise.lunacy jurisdiction, or, in places where
there are no separate Quarter Sessions, a Justice appointed by the Lord Chancellor for the same purpose; by a County Court Judge; or by a Stipendiary or Metropolitan Police Court Magistrate.3.     It was suggested at the last meeting of the Committee that the Form of Recommendation scheduled to the Bill should, in the case of persons incapable of volition or of minors, be countersigned by some impartial non-medical person. esg.. a justice of the peace.   My colleagues will appreciate that the introduction of a Justice for this purpose would asaimllate the procedure under Section 4 very closoly to that prescribed under the general law relating to the certification of lunatics in the strict sense, a policy which I am anxious to avoid, so far as possible.   I would- suggest, therefore, that in the cases now under consideration there might be added to the Form of Recommendstion scheduled to the Bill a statement which might be signed not only by a. Justice of the Peace, but also a minister of religion, a barrister,, or a solicitor, to the effect.that the person signing is acquainted with the patient, has seen him immediately before signing the statement, and has satisfied himself that he (the patient) is for the time being incapable of volition.   The form of the statement would, of course, have to be warded; differently in the case of a minor.   I think it very desirable that only those persons should be permitted to sign a statement of this kind who are in fact personally acquainted with the patient, though relatives should be excluded. A statement by any casual Justice, minister of religion, or lawyer, would be of no value for the purpose and a proposal of the kind would probably meet with criticism in Parliament.4.     If my colleagues approve of the above suggestion and are of opinion that it meets the views expressed at the last meeting of the Committee, I will have a Clause prepared to carry
It into effect) and I trust that with this addition the Committee will see their way to re come nd to the Cabinet that the Bill should be introduced at an early date in the House of Lords. .(INTLD.)    N.C.Ministry of Health,March, 22 nd 1923.
