Period ended February 9, 1923.SUMMARY OF UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION.The number of persons registered at the Employment Exchanges as wholly unemployed at the 5th February was 1,386,331, a decrease of 23,659 on the previous week.POSITION IN CHIEF INDUSTRIES.COAL-MINING.Depression continues in the Bristol and Somerset Coal-fields, but considerable improvement has occurred in the Forest of Dean. The situation in the Midlands continues to be satisfactory, and employment in the South Yorkshire and Durham Collieries remains good. Activity continues in Lancashire, while in Wales employ-ment is steady, with stoppages at some centres. In Scotland increased activity is reported.IRON AND STEEL.Although unemployment continues to be severe in the Midlands, there is evidence that the conditions may improve. Trade in Yorkshire and the North of England is very brisk, consequent upon the improved situation in the shipyards, and an increased demand from the Continent is apparent. In Lancashire there are signs of increasing activity, and in Wales also improvements are expected at most centres. Employment has also improved in Scotland and prospects are promising.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.In the Bristol area, apart from occasional ship-breaking and ship-repairing work, trade is slack. The situation on the Tyne and Tees continues to improve, and the outlook is encouraging. On the Mersey improvement continues on a moderate scale, but progress at Barrow remains slow. In Wales the position is a little better. Employment has improved on the Clyde.ENGINEERING.Employment in this industry is still far below normal, and recovery is slow. In the Midlands the improvement in the Motor Cycle section has been maintained, while in the North of England there has been some slight improvement in Marine. Engineering.TEXTILES.Cotton.-In Lancashire there has been a very small improvement, but the position is uncertain. In Yorkshire the depression continues and prospects are bad.Hosiery, Woollen and Worsted. Although in Yorkshire the position remains sub-normal, in the Midlands there is considerable activity in the Hosiery trade, and trade is brisk at all centres. In Scotland the Tweed industry remains steady, but under-employment is the rule in the Hosiery trade.Silk. In the Midlands there are prospects of a slight improvement.
Lace. Depression exists in the factories in the South-West of England. In the Midlands there is no improvement, and the outlook is not bright.Jute.--A steady improvement is reported, especially at Dundee.BUILDING.In the South-Western Counties trade is fair, but orders are being suspended pending an anticipated reduction in wages. A similar situation prevails in Lancashire and Wales. Business is slack in the Midlands, and in Yorkshire and the North of England few men are finding employment, apart from painters, who, with the approach of spring, are being engaged. Consequent upon the revision of wages in Scotland, employment in this industry is expected shortly to improve.BOOT AND SHOE.Seasonal slackness is reported at Bath and Bristol. In the Midlands the improvement previously recorded continues, but employment remains sub-normal. There has been some improvement at Norwich.CLOTHING.Unemployment is acute among women in the Tailoring and Dressmaking trades.POTTERY AND GLASS.In spite of a slight improvement, unemployment in the Pottery trade is still below normal, and no revival is expected until the spring. Unemployment in the Glass Bottle industry has increased at Wakefield and Gateshead, but at Mexborough a better tone is evident.TINPLATE.A large number of orders have been received, and firms are working regularly. TRANSPORT.On the North-East Coast unemployment and under-employment are still severe, except among workmen engaged in connection with the exportation of coal. Progress at Liverpool is slow but sure, but there is very little activity at Avonmouth. There is no change to record at the London Docks, but in Scotland, at Leith, there has been increased activity at the Docks following an increase in the import trade.C. A.

[From Autumn 1920 onwards.] Cabinet Unemployment Committee.The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, the then Cabinet appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment. This Committee continued to function till October 1922. The present Government appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee on the 1st November, 1922.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the 8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit, extended the periods of benefit and increased the contributions. As from November 1921 the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision for grants in respect of -wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed a special levy to provide for these grants. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, which operates as from the 6th April, 1922, amalgamates the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Bene&quot;fit, and the special levy with the Unemployment Insurance
contributions, and extends until June 1923 the special periods during which &quot; uncovenanted &quot; benefit may be drawn. The authority to borrow money from the Treasury is increased to  30,000,000.Table showing amount paid out in Unemployment Benefit (including Benefit in respect of Dependants), and the Contributions during the period from the 8th November, 1920, to the 3rd February, 1923.1.

Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from, autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Report. At least 300,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 138,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits Scheme.(C.) Recent Extensions of Remedial Measures.., Some of the measures comprised in (B) above are still in operation, e.g., past sanctions of grants by the Unemployed Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport. The Export Credits Scheme continues, and schemes approved under the Trade Facilities Act are in progress.In June 1922. the Unemployment Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport issued circular letters to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes for works of public utility, which, with assistance from State funds, might be undertaken for the relief of unemployment in their respective areas. Approved schemes are assisted by grants made on the same bases as heretofore. In the case of schemes assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee, particulars of grants already sanctioned are set out below.In September 1922, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries issued circular letters to County Councils (except the London County Council) and Drainage Authorities, inviting them to submit schemes of land drainage which, if approved, might be assisted on fundamentally the same conditions as those applicable in the [9522] b 3
Gcase of schemes assisted last year. All applications were to be received in the case of Drainage Authorities on or before December 1, 1922, and in the case of County Councils (Agricultural Committees) on or before December 16, 1922. County Councils were also circulated with regard to schemes for the supply of water to farms, the conditions of assistance from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries remaining substantially the same as last winter, with the exception that the Ministry, instead of advancing the whole cost ot any scheme and recovering a proportion from the owners concerned, will make grants to cover part only of the total cost of each scheme. Further circulars, issued to Uounty Councils and Drainage Authorities on the 5th and 6th December respectively, notified the extension of the date up to which applications might be received to the 13th January, 1923, and invited the submission of additional schemes. The time for receiving applications was further extended provisionally to the 10th February, .1923. Particulars of grants sanctioned and of the number of men employed to date are shown below (see table 6). 1On the 30tb November, 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the Ilouse of Commons, outlined the manner in which measures taken by the late Government would be continued and extended. The additional sums promised in extension of existing funds are set out below : Unemployment Grants Committee (for grants on the basis of60 per cent, of Wages Bill) ... Land Drainage Afforestation ...Acceleration of Government contracts Office of Works.......... 375,000General Post Office ... ... 946,000--     1,321,000It was also then announced that guarantees under the Trade Facilities Act Scheme would be made available up to  50,000,000 ( 25,000,000 extra); that the Export Credits Scheme would be extended if necessary; and that the Local Authorities concerned would be asked to co-operate in putting in hand the Manchester-Liverpool Road, which would involve an expenditure of about  3,000,000, half of it from the Road Fund.In December 1922, the Unemployment Grants Committee issued a further circular letter to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes suitable for assistance on the basis of 60 per cent, of the Wages Bill, i.e., works the cost of which is normally defrayed out of revenue and not by loan. The conditions under which grants may be sanctioned are substantially the same as those previously in force, except that in the case of Rural Districts the Committee have discretion to allow, where clearly necessary, a modification of the conditions regarding the giving of preference to 75 per cent, ex-service men and the engagement of labour through the Employment Exchanges.On the 12th December, 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, further announced that, in addition to the acceleration of contracts by the Post Office and Office of Works, previously described, the Admiralty would accelerate miscellaneous works to a total of about  365,000; whilst the Home Office would put in hand certain accelerated building work, together with repairs to buildings, including Police Stations.On the 13th December, 1922, the Forestry Commission issued a press notice to the effect that forestry grants were available for the relief of unemployment on the same general conditions as those applicable to grants made last winter. The sum of  100,000 referred to above is to be used partly for this purpose and partly for the purpose of relief schemes in Crown Forests and for additional work in the Commission^ forests by the Trade Facilities and Loans Guarantee Act, 1922 (Session 2), enacted on the loth December, 1922, formal sanction was given for the increase of the aggregate capital amount of loans the principal or interest of which mav be guaranteed under the Trade Facilities Act, 1921, from  25,000,000 to  50,000,000. 600,000 170,000 100,000
