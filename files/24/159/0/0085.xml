DOCUMENT IS THE&apos; PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.  641CABINET.AGRICULTURAL TRIBUNAL INTERIM REPORT. 13MEMORANDUM BY TEE MINISTER OP LABOUR. _________________________________.----SECRET 1.     The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries has0-PolS5 (23)   circulated a memorandum with regard to this Report.(CP. 184/23)...   I do not wish to refer to the general provisions of the Interim Report, nor of the memorandumj   hut only to paragraphs 35 to 38 of the Interim Report, and page IS of the memorandum, which raise issues as.to Agricultural Wages and Wages Boards. 2.     The Ashley report definitely advocates the constitution of six Distriot Wages Boards, to cover the whole of England and Wales, and uses, by way of argument, the analogy of the Trade Board machinery which exists for low-paid and unorganised industries.   This Trade Board machinery is administered by my Department. 3.     The memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture definitely rejects the proposal of the Ashley Report so far as Wages Boards are concerned.   The question of policy ia by no means an easy or simple one particularly having regard to the reaction of low agricultural wages upon other occupations.     I would only recall to my colleagues three points:-(a) That under the Corn Production Act there was a Central Agricultural Wages Board with full Statutory Authority to fix wages.(b) When the Com Production Act was repealed, views were expressed on our side of the House in favour of abolishing all machinery for regulating agricultural wagesj   but the pressure was so considerable from many/quarters
quarters that this was found to he impossible, and under the Corn Production Acts (Repeal) Act 1921, a sort of via media or compromise wage fixing machinery was established, of a voluntary oharaoter, In each County, (c) In my view, there la a good deal to be said for the position taken up in the Ashley Report, namely that definite wage-fixing machinery should be set up for the agricultural Industry. 4.    My colleagues will bear In mind that, by a decision of the Cabinet, I shall be introducing very shortly a Bill to consolidate and amend the law as to Industrial Trade Boards,     This Bill 1b in draft, and will be considered by the Home Affairs Committee this week.It is framed so as to carry out, generally speaking, the unanimous reoommendatiors of the strong Committee which was presided over by the Lord Chancellor last year. The two points must be kept dear -(a) The broad question, of policy which the Cabinet will decide as to whether Wages Boards machinery for agriculture is desirable or not.(b) Supposing such maohinery should prove to be desirable, then whether the Boards should be constituted by separate legislation, or under the existing Trade Board machinery.If the Cabinet should decide to set up wage regulating maohinery as in (a), I take it that a separate Bill would probably be thought necessary.     If, however, the Cabinet should decide against the Ashley Report, I am anxious that nothing which is said in the course of the Debate on/Wednesday

If, however, the Cabinet should decide against the Ashley Report, I am anxious that nothing which is said in the course of the Debate on/Wednesday! j
Wednesday should be of a oharacter to react on the position with regard to Trade Boards generally. 5.    There is this further point to be borne in mind, I have received representations from the Agricultural Workers&apos; Union that agriculture should be brought under the Industrial Trade Board Acts, and if the Government should decide generally against sotting up Wages Boards machinery for agriculture on the lines of the Ashley Report, undoubtedly the Labour Party will do all in their power, when I introduce the Trade Board Bill, to get the machinery of the Bill extended to agriculture. As I have already indicated in a memorandum to the Home Affairs Committee, (O.P. 175 (SS)) I think euoh an attempt should be resisted.(Intld.) M.B.Ministry of Labour, 9th April, 1925.
