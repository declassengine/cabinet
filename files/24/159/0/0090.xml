(This document ie the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.;OR ST. C A B I M 3 T.FTIPO(23).   ; WORKli tfli1S OOHPaTBATION. -I SMemorandum by the Home Secretary.I desire to obtain the approval of my colleagues for the following proposals in regard to the amendment of the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act.1. Alteration of Benefits.   I propose that the War Addition Acts, which add 75$  to the compensation payable under tho principal Act during total disablement, should be repealed, and that the provisions of the principal Act should be amended so as(a) to give additional benefits, up to an inclusive maximum of  500, in fatal cases where children are left;(b) to increase the.maximum for the weekly allowance in case of disablement from 20/- to 30/-, having regard to the alteration in the value of money;(o) to make some addition -; I suggest 50$ n to the weekly allowance in the low wage cases which will not be benefited by the increase of the maximum under (b), up to a maximum of  1.The grounds of the proposals and their effects are explained fully in the annexed Memorandum A.,   They will cost industry appreciably less than the present War -Addition Acts..-3. Limitation of insurance Premiums.   As my colleagues are aware,  it has long been a matter of criticism and complaint that an extravagantly high proportion of the premiums paid by employers to Insurance Companies in respect of workmen&apos;a compensation risks has been absorbed in commission, expenses
of management, and profits.   The climax was reached in 1921 when more than \ of the premiums was devoted to profit and not more than \ of the premiums was spent in payments for compensation.   This waste is a matter of serious concern for industry, especially at the present time, and the employers&apos; representatives have promised to support the Government in stopping it.   In order if possible to deal with the matter by agreement with the Companies, negotiations were commenced between the Home Office and the Accident Offices Association (which comprises the bulk of the chief Companies),   A Memorandum B showing the result of these   negotiations is appended.   It will be seen that while the Companies have made a substantial offer, the Government representatives are of the opinion that it does not go as far as could reasonably be required and they put forward alternative proposals for consideration.   I concur with their recommendations and ask for the approval of the Cabinet to continue the negotiations on these lines on the understanding that if a satisfactory settlement cannot be reached by agreement, it will be necessary to deal with the matter in the amending Bill.The arrangement proposed by the Government representative will result in a great saving to the employers insured with the Companies.   The actual amount of thejsaving would depend on the premium income which in recent years has been subject to wide fluctuations, but it is calculated that had the proposed arrangement been in operation in 1921 it would have resulted in a saving of between 2f and 3 million pounds.3&apos;. &quot;Arising out of&quot;.   I propose to deal in the Bill with a number of matters of secondary importance to which it iB not necessary to refer at this stage, hut there is one matter upon which I desire to obtain the opinion of my
colleagues.   By a long series of decisions in the Courts the position of the workman in cases where the injury arises from some breach of rules or instructions has been profoundly modified to his detriment, and the intention of Parliament (as embodied in the Act of 1906) practically nullified.   The present position is set out in Memorandum d appended.    Though the Departmental Committee did not see their way to recommend legislation, the matter is one On which the workmen feel very keenly;    a strong attempt will certainly be made by them, if nothing is done by the Government, to get the matter put right when the Bill is in Parliament, and they will have a great deal of sympathy and support in the attempt.    I think it wise that the Government should show itself ready and desirous of meeting the claim of the workers so far as it is just and I would propose that we should restore the law to what it was intended to be in 1906.We must be prepared of course to face opposition from the employers and it is unfortunate that we have not a recommendation of the Committee to support us.    On the other hand the case for restoring the 1906 position is undoubtedly a strong one;   the additional charge to industry will be infinitesimal (the total number of cases affected is comparatively quite small);   and the proposal will give great satisfaction to the workers and help to mitigate their disappointment at the benefit provisions of the Bill which fall far abort of the recommendations of the Departmental Committee.W. C. B.9a.4-6,
WORKMSK&apos;S COMPENSATION.Memorandum   A.BENEFITS IN CASE OF DEATH -   The compensation provided by the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act 1906 in fatal cases is a sum equal (where total dependants are left) to  150 or 3 years&apos; earnings, whichever is the larger, up to a maximum of  300. This scale has remained unchanged since the original Act of 18-97.The Compensation is computed on the earnings of the deceased workman without regard to the number and age of the dependants -an elderly widow without family receives the same amount as a widow with young children - and the Holman Gregory Committee considered that there was a pressing need to make more satisfactory provision for cases where young children are left. They unanimously recommended that, in addition to the widow&apos;s compensation, the children-should be awarded oompensation in the form of weekly allowances which should be payable up to the&apos; age of 15.   To provide these allowances^ the employers were to be required in every case where a child under 15 is left to make a flat payment of  500 into a Central Fund under Government control. This scheme is no doubt a good one, but if proposed now, would bo strongly opposed as involving too heavy a liability at the present time, and some much more moderate provision must be adopted.It is proposed that in oases where the workman leaves total dependants including one or more children under the age of 15, an additional allowance calculated according to the age of the child shall be payable in respect of each such child;    that these allowances shall be added to and dealt with as part of the compensation payable under the Act of 1906;    and that the total amount of the compensation payable to dependants in such cases shall be fixed at  500.The employers&apos; representatives whom I have consulted aro i.. favour of differentiation in the case of widows with young children and have intimated their willingness to go up to  400
and even higher if their views in regard to the rest of the bill are met.BENEFITS IN CaSE OP INCAPACITY - The Act of 1906 provides in disablement cases for a weekly payment not exceeding 60 per cent of the average weekly earnings up to a maximum of  1.   By the War Addition Act of 191? it was provided that the workmanishall be entitled, if and so long as he is totally disabled, to an additional weekly allowance equal to 25^ of the weekly payment due under the Act of 1906..   By the War Addition Act of 1919 this allowance was increased to 75^*   Thus a workman entitled to a maximum weekly payment of  1 under the Act of 1906 is entitled also during total disablement to a War Addition of 15/-.The War Addition Acts were passed by agreement as emergency measures and it was provided that they should lapse six months after the war.   In View, however, of the continued high cost of living they have been kept alive by means of the Expiring Laws Acts and are now in force up to the 31st December, 1923.It is very deeirable that the War Addition Acts should be brought to an end as soon as possible.   Under these Acts the weekly compensation payable to a workman whose wages do not exceed  2, amounts to nearly 87j$ of the wages.    This means that the financial inducement to the workman to return to work is very small and at a time like the present this has serious consequences.   On the other hand, having regard to the present rates of wages and cost of living which remain and seem likely to remain for some years at any rate far above pre-war level, it would be unjustifiable (even when the fullest allowance is made for the necessity of relieving the burden on industry) to ask the workman to revert now to his pre-war position.   The question therefore is what can be put in the place of the War Addition Acts?The Departmental Committee recommended (by a majority) (a) that the percentage of earnings should be raised from 50$ to
ee^fo and (b) that the maximum-of- l-should&quot;be-raised to;  3. :These recommendations were made at a time when the trade boom was at its height and wages and cost of living were still rising.. The average percentage increase in thd cost of living stood then at 152 and rose further in the succeeding months till it reached its maximum - 176 - in November 1920.   Thereafter it declined progressively till the Spring of 1922, bince when it has remained at or about 80.   The.figure for March 1923 is 76.The workers&apos; representatives still press for the full increases recommended by the Departmental Committee but in view of the change of circumstances this is impracticable.The employers&apos; representatives offer the strongest opposition to any increase of the 50% of the weekly earnings, except perhaps in the case of the badly paid workmen, and they are also against any permanent alteration in the  1 maximum while the conditions are normal.   They would prefer that an additional weekly allowance calculated in the same way as the War Addition, but of reduced amount, should be provided, and they have suggested that the allowance should be fixed at 25 or 30 per cent of the weekly payment under the Act of If06.   This, in view of the present cost of living, seems to me to be clearly inadequate.I agree with the employers that the 50 per cent should not be altered, but I am of the opinion that the  1 maximum ought to be raised.The alteration in the value of money) brought about by the war, has completely altered the position as regards the maximum limit of  1, and but for the War Addition Acts, the workmen woulci be in a far worse position than they were before the war. Assuming that wages will continue on a higher level than before the war to correspond with the change in the value of money, the retention of the old pre-war limit Beeras indefensible.   The strictly logical course would no doubt be to make the maximum limit vary with the change in the value of money, but this would
be objectionable and difficult in practice, and some permanentincrease on the present limit would seem the best solution.I The proposal is that the  1 maximum should be raised to 30/-.The increase in the maximum will not of course be of any benefit to workers whose wages do not exceed  3 and in order to compensate these workers to some extent for the loss of the War Addition, it is proposed that where,  in the case of total incapacity, the weekly payment under the Act of 1906 is less than  1, a weekly addition shall be paid during such incapacity equal to 50$ of the weekly payment, so, however, that the total amount payable does not exceed  1.The following table shows the amount of the weekly compensation which would be payable under these proposals at different rates of wages;-I also propose that those already in receipt of the present War Addition should continue to receive it during total disablement, iio serious objection is likely to be taken to this.On the question of cost the Government Actuary has estimated that the net effect of the above proposals (together with certain other minor changes) would be -(1) To reduce the total cost of compensation on the present scale under the 1906 Act and the War Addition Acts by about 11 per cent. (S) To increase the total ocst of compensation on the 1906 Act scale by about 3b&apos; per cent. The general effect therefore would be to diminish the present burden on industry.Weekly Wage.Rate of Compensation.20/-30/-40/-50/-60/-15/-20/-20/-25/-30/-
MEMORANDUM    B.NEGOTIATIONS WITH TEE ACCIDENT OFFldSS ASSOCIATION.IDDuring the last ten years or so an extravagant proportion of the premiums received by Insuranoe Companies in respect of Workman&apos;s Compensation risk has befen absorbed by expanses of management, Commissions and profits^ and conferences have taken plade between the Home Offioe (represented by Sir Malcolm Delevingne, K.0jB., (Chairman), Sir Alfred WatBon, K.C.B,, Sir Walter Kinnear, K.B.E., Mr. R.R.Bannatyne O.B., and Mr. CM. Knowles, LL.B.) and the Accident Offices Association (represented by Mr. W.E. Gray, Mr. J.C. McBride, M.B.EJ, Mr. R.M&apos;Connell and Sir Arthur Worley, C.B.E.) in order to disouBB the position and Buggest a remedy.Notes of the proceedings at the throO meetings which have been l-o: held are annexed hereto.The Departmental Committee on Workmen&apos;e Compensation, presided over by Mr. Hblman Gregory, which reported in 1920, in drawing atten-tion to this matter, pointed put that during the preceding five sr six years employers had had to pay  100 in premium for every  48 paid out in benefits to injured, workmen.     To remedy the state of things which they described as &quot;wasteful and unsatisfactory&quot; they arrived at a formal agreement with the Accident Offices Association, the effect of which was td provide that in future (l) at least 70$ of the premium income should be expended in benefits to injured workinon and their dependants, and (2) that the remaining 30$ should be available for management expenses, profits and the cost of commission, the latter not to oxoeed 5$ of tho premium income.     To give effect to this scheme thore was to be State supervision of rates of premiums, provision being made for an Advisory Committee on Rates on which the Acoident Offices Association should bo represented.     It was understood that Insuranoe :ftwas to be compulsory.Sjij.ce 1918, the latest year for which figures   were available before the Holman Gregory Committee, the problem whioh the Conference has had under consideration has grown progressively more urgent, as will be seen by the following Table, whioh is based on the annual

contributor to the profit&quot;sxde^of&apos;&apos;tne&quot;composiW&quot;T?rofit and. loss account.This state of things has been the subject of strong&quot;orl.tioi.sm.., and not from the Labour Parity alone.     Thus, during the Debate in the House of Commons on I.ir. Sextons Motion on March 2lst, Major Birchall, the Unionist Member for H^E^Leeds^ said &quot;The test of private enterprise must be economy and efficiency in working, andif................. the workmen only get one- third of the amountindustry has to contribute, then I say it is neither efficient nor economical&quot;.At the outset of the first meeting, tho Accide&quot;rf  Offices Association representatives stated that they regarded the agreement entered into with the Holman Gregory Committee in 1920 as scrappod. The grounds of this attitude were that compulsory insurance had been abandoned and that instead,of the further large increase of premiums which was anticipated as the result of the trade boom and the     - - -increased benefits recommended by the Committee, there had been a great reduction of premium income due partly to lower &quot;rates of wages and partly to wide-spread Unemployment,     They were, however, prepared, if possible, to arrive at a new agreement and for that purpose to accept a fixed loss ratio (that is to say to agree that premiums should be so fixed that the amount spent in the payment of compensation should reach a given poroentage of the pz&apos;emium income) based on the experience of all tho Companies.     They offered a fixed loss ratio of 60$ (on the basis of premiums actually received) as compared with the 70$ agreed upon with tho Holman Gregory Committee. On the figures of 1921 this would havo allowed approximately 11 to 12$ for commission, S3 to 24$ for expenses of management and 5$ for profit.     They urged, however, that owing to a further fall in the premium income since 1921, there would be an increase to about 27$ in management expenses, notwithstanding that there had been a eab-stantial reduction in the total amount of such expenses,  and that consequently the margin for profit would be practically nil-     The largo profits of recent years wore due to abnormal conditions which.
are not likely te recur.Ae regards the method to be adopted for adjusting ratos tothe fixed loss ratio, they proposed at the outset to fix a ratefor eaoh trade which would result as nearly as possible in a 60$loss ratio.     At the end of eaoh year they would adjust anydeviation from the fixed loss ratio by a system of discounts and *additions on the following year&apos;e premiums.     Thus, if compensationpaid during the year amounted to  3,000,000, and premiums actuallyreceived were  6,000,000, then  1,000,000 would have to be returnedto employers by discounts at flat rates on the following year&apos;spremiums for all industries.At the same time they would, as experience showed it to be necessary, revise the rates for the individual trades, so as to raake them conform to the fixed loss ratio.As to the duration of the proposed agreement, they laid great stress on the point that owing to industrial conditions being still unsettled, they did not see their way to any permanent arrangement, but proposed an arrangement for a period of 3 or 5 years, at the end of which it should be reconsidered,Generally, in support of their view that a 60$ loss ratio was reasonable, they argued that the bulk of premiums were paid upon the basis of a percentage on the wage roll.     Wages were decreasing;   unemployment was rife;   and these conditions - which they thought had not yet touched bottom - produced a marked     t diminution of premiums.     Moreover, they pointed out that the loss ratio would be calculated not on the present premium income, but on an income reduced in order to bring the loss ratio up to 60$. On the other hand expenses could not be correspondingly reduced. The only reduction possible was in the cost of commission which they thought might be brought down to 7% to 8$ of premium income, although they anticipated great difficulties in effeoting this reduction.     Further, they were quite in the dark as to the benefits to be proposed in the new Bill, a circumstance which in
itself, made it difficult to see into the future in regard tc premium income-     The offer of 60$ loss ratio was a substantial one.     If a 60$ loss ratio had been in existence in 1921, the -total premium income of over  7,000,000 would have been reduced tc? about  6,000,000.   &apos;The Government representatives&apos; considered that the case for a loss ratio e&amp;ff30$, that is to say 10$ less than that provided for in the Holman Gregory report, had not been made out.     The experience of 1922 was not a fair basis,     That year was a period of abnormal depression which was already passing away.     Further, no allowance had been made for a reduction in the ratio of manage--ment expenses consequent on any rise in premium income nor was any allowance made for a reduction in the present cost of commission. The Government could not possibly hope to justify to the House of Commons an agreement based on a commission rate of 11 to 12$.     The representatives of the Companies themselves had agreed that this rate was much too high.     It was also suggested that the employers&apos; liability account tended to carry an undue share cf the expenses of a composite office.   Even if the uncertainties of the future were admitted, a 60$ loss ratio gave the whole benefit of the doubt to the Companies as against the employer.It was put to the Accident Offices Association representatives that even taking management expenses at their present very high figure of 27$ and allowing for a reduction of commission to not more than 8-1$, there would be left In view of the very largeprofits amassed by the Companies in the reoent prosperous years, it would not&apos; be unfair that the percentage of profits taken out of the 64f$ should bo merely nominal while bad times continued.     in that case a higher loss ratio than 60$would be quito reasonable even under the existing conditions.       As the premium income rose with improving industrial conditions, the 27$ for management expenses would fall and profits automatically increase.The Accident Offices Association representatives showed no disposition to increase their offer of a &apos;160$ loss ratio.
The Goverrmient-representatives -have-come- to - the &quot;foil-owing conclusions:- i(l) On the assumption that the Government and Parliament are prepared to accept a p\r ely temporary settlement, they recommend that a loss ratio of not less than 62i?$ - to he calculated with reference to tho experience only of the Accident Offices Association -&apos;should he required and that the position should he reviewed after three years.     In order to avoid small adjustments and to reduce the amount of clerical work, a margin of variation not to exceed 1$ or 1-1$ inight be allowed on either, side.(2) Oh the assumption that the Government and Parliament would not be satisfied with a settlement which would leave the whole question to be re-opened in two or three years, and that- a more or less permanent settlement should be reached, they think the only practicable course would be to make the loss ratio vary with the premium income on some sliding soale arrangement.     The minimum of the scale should be 62-1$ and a system could bo devised by which the loss ratio would be increased say by a half per cent for each quarter of a million increase in the premium income above an agreed basic figure (which would be fixed on an examination of the figures for all the Companies making returns to the Board of Trade).The Government representatives anticipate that the Companies will be unwilling to accept any permanent arrangement at tho present time, and if that proves to be the case, they recommend the adoption of the first of tho foregoing alternative plans.9F. 168-172
MEIOKaHDUH c. &quot;ARISING OUT of under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Aot,  1906, which in this respect simply re-enacts the original Act of 1897, compensation is payable only in respect of &quot;personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment&quot;.In the discussion in Parliament on the Bill of 1897 and again on the Bill of 1906 the question was debated at lengthwhether and in what circumstances a workman or his dependantsshould be deprived of compensation if the accident was due toa breach of regulations, drunkenness or similar misbehaviour.In the Act of 1897 it was provided that in all cases where the injury was attributable to the serious and wilful misconduct ofthe workman, * compensation should be disallowed.    This wasmodified in the Act of 1906 which provides that if the injuryis attributable to serious and wilful misconduct, the compensation&quot;shall unless the injury results in death or serious and permanentdisablement be disallowed&quot;.    The main ground for this modificationwas that the denial of compensation in these cases would inflictan undue penalty especially as the chief sufferers were likelyto be the innocent dependants of the workman.    It was alsonpointed out that in case of death the lips of the man who was the victim of what was said to be his misconduct ware closed; he was no longer a witness in the case as to the degree and character of the misconduct which had to be determined and therefore he was not able to clear himself from any reproach which night be made upon him&quot;.Throughout the discussions it was assumed that a workman who met with an accident in connection with his employment, would not be deprived of compensation on the ground that the
accident was the result of misconduct unless some special provision as to disqualification were inserted, and it was generally recognised that a breach of regulations unless it amounted to serious and wilful misconduct ought not to disqualify for compensation,   Since 1906, however, a series of decisions have been given by the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords, the general effect of which is that if a workman meets with an accidont through doing some act which by statutory regulations or his employer&apos;s instructions he is expressly forbidden to do or which it is unreasonable that he should do, he is held to be acting outside the scope of his employment and the accident does not arise out of the employment.Apart from the question of principle the present position is very unsatisfactory.    It is not every breach of a rule or instruction that will -disqualify the workman.   The Courts have drawn various distinctions - in particular between doing something : which though done recklessly is within the sphere of the employment, and doing something which is outside the sphere of employment altogether,,   In the former case compensation may be awarded (unless precluded by the seriouB and wilful misconduct provision),   A very large number of cases have been taken in the Courts in order to determine on which side of the line the case falls and, unless something is done, this litigation will continue.   Nor can it be contended that the line of demarcation drawn by the decisions of the Courts corresponds in fact to a real distinction between acts which involve serious danger and those which do not.   The performance by a miner of some duty entrusted to him in a negligent dnd reckless mannor may easily have much more serious consequences both to himself and his fellow-workers than the doing of some act which was altogether outside the sphere of his employment.Some of the most notable instances where the rule above mentioned has been applied have been mining cases;    and the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain have continued strenuously
to press for a reversal of the rule by legislation.The Departmental Committee of 1920 came to the . conclusion (by a majority) that they could not recommend anychange., but I am of opinion that the law as now interpretedloperates too harshly on the workman and should be modified.It has been urged on behalf of Labour that the words &quot;out of&apos;1 should be deleted so that compensation would be payable in respect of any injury arising in the course of the employment.   The deletion of these words; however, would destroy the principle bf any causal connection between the accident and the employment and would let in not only cases of the class above referred to, but also cases in other categories to which it was never intended that the Act should apply-:    This seems to me to go much too far.    In my view all that is desirable and practicable to do is to restore the Act substantially to what it was intended to be in 1906. The exact form of words will require careful consideration, but I think that the object in view could be secured with the least possible disturbance and without opening a door to much further litigation by a provision to the effect that when an injury occurs to a workman while doing something in connection with his employer&apos;s business and the injury is due to a breach of regulation or instruction, compensation shall not be disallov.red on the ground simply that it does not arise out of &apos;the employment,    it should be made clear, however, that in such cases the provisions relating to serious and wilful misconduct will still apply.
