(OP. 147/23.)      J* ^The Minister of Pensions now proposes to pass over, on 1st April next, the reduction (for cost of living) of alternative pensions and treatment allowances, which were explicitly excluded from the decision of last November to &quot; peg &quot; flat-rate pensions until 1926. He would on this occasion put off reduction for 1 year only, and then &quot; further consider the question of making such reductions as part of a, general scheme for the final settlement of rates of all pensions and allowances.&quot;It appears clear that, as the great bulk of pensions have already been &quot; pegged &quot; till 1926, the only result of raising the question again in 1924 must be either to fix permanently all pensions, &amp;c, under the administration of the Ministry of Pensions, at present rates, or to postpone the question for a further period ; and any failure to carry through a reduction of which warning has been given, only makes it the more difficult to carry it through at any future time. &apos; -I wish to point out that not only war disability pensions, but the service pensions and the pay of the fighting services are due for reduction on account of cost of living in 1924, and the. case against then making a reduction in them is almost as strong, on its merits, as it is for disability pensions.The general scales of disability and widows&apos; pensions were fixed in September, 1919, when the index figure was 115 per cent. In November last it was 78 per cent, and the average over the whole intervening period had been 121 per cent. Assuming an average index of 78 per cent, to continue from November, 1922, to June, 1923, the average for the 45 months would then be 115 per cent, (the index of September, 1919), and the pensioner would have received his just dues. The argument for continuing to pay him on an index of 115 per cent, till April, 1926, while the actual index is 78 per cent, or thereabouts, rested merely on the fact that, for the three months, April-June, 1923, he was a little behind.Army service pensions were fixed with effect from April, 1919, when the index was 110 per cent. The average index to November, 1922, was 120 per cent., and, assuming an average index of 78 per cent, from that date, the account would balance in December, 1923. For Army pay, which was fixed with effect from July, 1919 (index 110 per cent.), the account would balance (at 78 per cent.) in January, 1924.The inequality involved in cutting down Army pay and. pensions in July, 1924, while disability pensions are maintained at the 1919 rate till 1926 will be glaring.So long as direct Government remuneration to all classes paid from the Exchequer contains an element explicitly declared to be variable with the cost of living, I see the greatest difficulty in giving preferential exemption from reductions due on that ground to any class, even to pensioners. To maintain our enormous pension expenditure at present rates, thus making it more difficult to reduce the high cost per head of the armed forces, while at the same time reducing the share of the national income available for defence, is a policy that may involve the gravest consequences.9122D.The War Okfice,21st March, 1923.(B23/104)   100   3/23   W.O.P.   761
