1 ^       481THIS BOOUtEBI IS TO) PROPHETY OF HIS BRITAMIO MAJSS^S OOTBBMSflT.OABIHEI. , vHedttotion of certain War pensions and Allowances.Memorandum by the Minister of T. &quot; Labour.), In the consideration of the Memorandum whioh the liinisterof Pensions has circulated (CP. 147/23), on the question of re&amp;uotion of War Pensions and Allowances, it should be borne in mind that the adoption of his recommendation &quot;that no reduction should be made in the present year in any of the grants or allowances authorised by the Hoyal TTarrants&quot; will necessitate the continuance of the allowances whioh are being paid to disabled men coming under the Training 3oheme whioh is administered by the Ministry of Labour.   In accordance with the Beoommendations of the Galoot committee on Pensions of whioh I was Chairman, it has always been tho practice to keep these Training allowances in line with the Pensions allowances.Hy officers, and those of the Minister of Pensions, had had under discussion the question of mailing reductions, and it is desirable that in this matter the two Ministries should maroh together.Representations have been made to me from time to time (with increasing force as wages in Industry generally fell) to the effect that the magnitude of the allowances is a bar to obtaining employment for trainees on the completion of training, beoauae in many instances the trainee receives more than the Bid.lied men with whom he worlcs and on whose goodwill he is dependent for the retention of his job.   for instance, the/Training
Training allowances for a disabled trainee with a wife and two children total ,13. 3. 64., or if he lives away from his home  40 1. Od: this oompai&apos;08 with rates of from 52/- to 6o/lld., a week for skilled engineers in ordinary industry, and with y/ages varying from 55/- to 73/4d, a week, according to locality, in the case of carpenters.   On these grounds I was prepared to consider a reduction in the training allowances, unpopular though this might be held to be, because the case for it was so strong, in the intereat3 of the disabled men themselves; that I felt that the british legion could not really quarrel with it0 But, as 1 have said, the Tensions allowances and the draining allowances have always marched side by side, and if the pensions allowances are to be maintained I cannot make any change in draining allowances; with me - unlike, I think, the Pensions -the matter is not primarily one of &quot;economy&quot;, as the saving in Training allowances would not be great and, of course, in any event the Training Scheme is rapidly coming to an end;   but having regard to the interests of the trainees themselves and in order to facilitate the efforts to obtain employment at the end of their training, I was considering a proposal to reduce Training allowances; however, it is clearly impracticable for me to do &apos; so if there ia to be no similar proposition in regard to the Tensions allowances.flntld.)   M.B.Ministry of labour, 21st March, 1923.
