4l/. iL^DOCUMSHT IS THE PROPERTY 01? HIS BBITAMIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOl/EENMSjUI).G A 3 I II E T.3 B T i1.58 ( 3) . COMMITTEE PIT SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES ACT --APPLICATION TO. FRANCE. BELGIUM AND ITALY.Report by the Lord President of the Council, on the proceedings of the Committee, together with his Conclusions.mThe Cabine\ Committee havo ascertained that the Foreign Office see no sufficient objection on general political grounds,,-.&apos;-to the imposition of a duty upon French lace.   Even upon the narrower ground of the possibility of French retaliation the Foreign Office is of opinion that France is so anxious at this moment not to quarrel with us that there is little danger of such a retort.     They admit however that this last is a natter&quot; for the judgment rather ef the Board of Trade than of the Foreign. Office and upon this the Board, of Trade are definitely of opinion that there is serious risk of retaliation and of the withdrawal by the French Government of what is in fact most favoured nation treatment towards this Country.The Committee accented tho finding of the President of the Board:, of. Trade that upon the facts submitted to him there is probably prima facio evidence of clumping due to the fall of the exchange in France&quot; which is likely seriously to affect employment, in the Nottingham lace trade,   A discussion however arose as to whether in view of this finding the Institution of an Inquiry was mandatory under the Act.     In.the case in question the words of the Aot are &quot;The Board may refer&apos;the matter&quot; etc.    The Comm-ittee agreed to the conclusion that in this connection &quot;may&quot; does not mean &quot;shall&quot; thouch the First Lord of. the Admiralty
considered that the discretion which the -word &quot;may&quot;&apos; Five8 to the Board of Trade ought to be ver^jjagrcwly restricted.V, :./&quot;-The issue then which. the Committee -had to try is.:-,..Given on the one hand thi\tth.ere.vis&apos; probably a SSi-raa^lacie case of dumping due tc the fall in exchange, and given on the other thivt the Board of Trade apprehend&apos;that if Part- II-of-the-Act&apos;is applied France will deprive us of most favoured nation treat-ment, is there good ground for the Beard of Trade to refuse an Inquiry ?The facts as regards,the lace trade are shortly these :-The lace trade in the past has largely depended upon its expert trade.    In pre-war times; approximately three-quarters of the total production was exported.    The export trade has fallen to one-third at one-half its pre-war volume.    The trade is therefore in difficulties.    The truth Is that fcr a oensidstable time they have been suffering, not only abroad but&apos;in this Country (which is the material consideration) through French sales at prices with which they cannot compete.   Up till now they were-unable to produce sufficiently strong evidence cf an exchange bounty.   But as the recent fall in the French&apos;-exchange dees not appear to have been followed by a corresponding increase in working costs, the Board feel unable to reject the allegation that a prirca -facie case of a bounty&apos; is established.   This carries with it-the -implication that the competition -is likely tc become more serious and it may be said therefore thst employment in the industry is likely to be seriously affected.Upon these facts I would point out that the probability of a ^riga,facie case of a bounty is not sufficient.    The Board are net empowered by
the section to act unless-: the case - not merely the prima facie case - of a bounty appears to it to be established.     But even if this condition were fulfilled there is   the discret-reactionary power of the President of the Board of Trade and until at any&quot;rate the bounty has been followed by the beginning of an    aotual loss of trade I am of opinion that in the exereise of his discretion he should refuse to order an    &apos; Inquiry the oonseQAiences of which may be so formidable.I would only add in reference to this conclusion that two&apos; points seem to be important.(1) The refusal of an Inquiry must not be made to depend in any degree upon the fact that the Nottingham lace trade ia a small trade and the number of persons employed a relatively small number.     Such a treatment of Part II of the Act would deservedly be resented.     And( ) It must not be suggested that by this decision we precludo ourselves from imposing upon-Pranoe, Belgium and Italy a duty under Part II.     The laoe trade In this country may become actually affected,     Moreover the sane causes which have produced the opportunity of a bounty in the laoe trade might operate in many others and if that were to- happen the cumulative effect of a number of such cases on the Home market might be even more serious,     Should these conditions arise it will be for the Cabinet to determine how far the discretion-&apos; ary refusal of the Board of Trade is to be exercised and no language should be used upon the present occasion which would pre-judge that issue,(Intd.)     S.4th. March, 192.5.
