138      1T^J^LIAMEHtABY CAMDIDATUREJ)^ STATE SERVANTS. &apos;MemOo by the Treasuryclo The Union of postal workers has recently written to the Prime Minister asking that &quot;the right to contest Parliamentary elections without permanent forfeiture of Office, recently granted to all ranks of His Majesty&apos;8 Army and Navy,, may be extended to Civil Servants&quot;,The question cannot be confined to those Civil Servants whom the Union of Postal Workers represents, (it has in fact been raised as a general question by the Labour Party) nor dan it be considered without reference to the existing practice in the lighting Services.     The issue is 3  indeed   verv im ortant    involving serious consideration of the principles which should govern the relation of State Servants to Politics. 2. The present rules for the Civil Service andthe Fighting Services are summarised below, (i)    CIVIL SFRVICFClause 16 of the Order In Council of January 10th, 1910, runs :-&quot;Any officer seeking a seat In the House of Commons shall resign his office so soon as he Issues his address to the electors,  or in any other manner publicly announces himself as a candidate,&quot;The rule does not apply to a Civil Servant retiredon pension,(ii)    FIGHTIW: QFRVICRS (a)    OfficersNaval Officer M,P&apos;s on the active list are usually already on half pay but    if not, are placed on half pay &quot;on or before election,&quot;     They are not precluded by Regulationfrom.....

This higher rate is not applicable to Naval Officer M.P.&apos;sAn Army Officer may remain on full pay until the date of his election. Re is then either seconded or placed on half-pay.The seconded officer      Jft^half-gaj. officer(Officers above Major have not (Half-pay is open tothe opticn of being seconded officers of all ranks) for this purpose)(a) draws no Army pay while an (a) draws half-pay withM..P.  or afterwards when limit of 5 or in specialsupernumerary waiting case 10 years when heabsorption unless specially must retire, employed by the Army Council,(b) retains his seniority (b) retains seniority absolutely, relatively (if he Is 6thCaptain, he returns as 6th Captain)(c) earns no retired pay while (c) earns no retired pay seconded and seconded while on half-pay and service does not count as half-pay service does service towards increase cf not count as service pay. towards increase of pay&apos;.(d) is replaced, by an officer of (d.) is replaced by anthe same rank unless he is officer of the same ranka Major (ether than a Major of Artillery), when he is replaced by a Captain,(e)..&apos;..

Officers.or other ranks;   but at the time of there cent election the Admiralty issued a Fleet Order stating that &quot;a Naval Rating whe, having&apos;received permission to stand as Parliamentary candidate,  is elected, will be given the option of taking a free discharge or of being transferred to the Royal Fleet Reserve for a period not exceeding two years during which he may elect to take his discharge, or may, subject to Admiralty permission, revert to the Active Service to complete his engagement.&quot;The Tar Office made no such statement;   but hold that a soldier is entitled to stand.     They are inclined to think that he should be put in practically the same position as the officer, and should, be given leave without pay,3. The exclusion of Civil Servants from parliamentary candidature has rested on the ground that it is necessary at all costs to avoid the political!sation of the public services,
The objections to this are cogently stated in the Majority Report of the Royal Commission on the Civil Service (1914) and may be quoted here (chap,xi. paras.10-11):&quot;In the first place, we have little doubt that complete liberty of political action for all officials alike would Inevitably result in freqixent conflicts between the desires and interests of the officer as a citizen and his duty as an official, and that such conflicts could not fail to have, a disastrous effect on the morale of the p.xblic service.&quot;&quot;Such conflicts may occur without any direct breach of official confidence.     Let us suppose an officer of the Foreign Office making a speech on a public platform upon some question of foreign policy, being at the time the subject of diplomatic negotiations;    or an officer of the Treasury or of one of the great Revenue Departments speaking publicly upon some controversial topic of taxation, which might be the subject of acute party difference, such as the recent Licensing legislation, or the Fiscal question;   or an officer of the far Department taking, a prominent part in controversy as to the merits of voluntary and compulsory service; . or again, to take a less extreme instance, let us suppose that an officer criticises the policy, not of the department in which he serves, but that of some other department or the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government for the time being as a ^ho&quot;.e, in all these cases there could be no doubt as to the impropriety of the officer&apos;s conduct and its inconsistency with his position as a permanent official,&quot;&quot;&quot;6 have already/ pointed out that the Civil Service is now being called upon to take a greater share in the burden of administration than was known a generation ago;   and it cannot be denied that the success or failure of much legislation of a contro-versial character depends now much more, largely than formerly upon administrative action,     The conduct of the Civil Service will,, therefore, come more frequently under public notice than it has done, and. in these circumstances it would, we think, be disastrous if the feeling should arise that the effectiveness of a legislative policy were in an:; &apos; degree dependent upon the&apos; political bias of those administering it,&quot;&quot;Speaking generally, we think that if restrictions on the political activities of public servants were withdrawn two results would probably follow.     The public might cease to believe, as we think they do now with reason believe, in the impartiality of the permanent Civil Service; . and Ministers might cease to feel the well-merited confidence which they possess at present in the loyal and. faithful support of their official subordinates;    indeed they might be led to scrutinise the utterances or writings of suchsubordinates.
subordinates, and to select for positions of confidence only those whose sentiments were known to be in political sympathy with their own.&quot;&quot;If this were so, the system of recruitment by open competition would prove but a frail barrier against Ministerial patronage in all but the earlier years of service;    the Civil Servico would cease to be in fact an impartial non-political body, capable of leyal service to all Ministers and parties alike; the change would soon affect the public estimation of the Service, and the result would be destructive of what undoubtedly is at present one of the greatest advantages of our administrative system and one of the most honourable traditions of our public life.&quot;4; It should be pointed out that there is nothing inthe present Regulations to prevent Associations of Civil Servantsfrom becoming affiliated to a political party (one or twoAssociations are in fact already affiliated to the Labour party or Trade Union Congress).     This is a development that requirescareful watching,!?; It has indeed been suggested (indeed the Report ofthe Royal Commission implies - chap. xi. paragraph 14) that the arguments in support of restrictions cn the political activities of public servants do not apply with the same force to the subordinate grades of the Civil Service, as to the higher or directing grades.     To a certain extent this may be true, but the statement cannot be accepted without qualification;    In the Post Office, for exampley and in many other Departments, it is the subordinate and middle grades Who come most, into contact with the public, and whose reputation for political impartiality, no less than that of more highly placed officers, it is essential to preserve.     It would be at least as embarrassing for a Sub-Postmaster, who is well known locally and has access to all local/communications in reply to a Parliamentary Question the late Prime Minister on 28th June 1920 said that he was not aware of.any formal restrictions which prohibited the affiliation of organised bodies of Civil Servants to the Labour Party or Trade Union Congress but that for Civil Servants as a body to join any political party in the State would be obviously unwise and pernicious.
communications, to be labelled a political partisan, ae for a Headquarters officer who is relatively unknown. And imagine tho effect in the case of local Revenue Officials, Inspectors of Taxes and others.6. In any event it would be a matter of extraordinarydifficulty, if not impossible, in practice, to draw and maintain the line between those allowed, ar.d those not allowed, to engage without restraint in political activities:   and it is difficult to resist the conclusion that if exception were once granted, exception would become the rule.7. Excluding the case of the Inland Revenue and customs and Excise Departments, there are perhaps special considerations which make the maintenance of the existing restrictions more important in the case of the Post Office than in other Depart-ments.     Propaganda and organisation at ar. Election are conducted mainly by postal and telagraphio communication and numbers of subordinate Postal Servants have the opportunity of tampering with, divulging or withholding such communications passing through their hands.   Offences of this character would probably be rare, and proof and conviction would be rarer still;   but it would hardly be possible to maintain public confidence in the eeorecy and impartiality of the post Office if its local officers were known to have definite political associations;   e.g. if the local Postmaster were an avowed supporter of one party, would his opponents) be willing to le^i their confidential telegrams pass through his hands?8, A last point of practical importance Is this.   suppose the right to contest elections were conceded.   An unsuccessful candidate for Parliament would in that event be permitted to return to his post.     The successful candidate would resign it. ^t suppose that he loses his seat at a subsequent election; will there not be a demand for his reinstatement?   This might be found difficult to resist;   but a nan who hovers between the/Civil
Service and Parliament would be a very embarrassing servant for the State.9. It will be seen from this statement of the position that there is a wide differentiation between the personnel of the Fighting Services and cf the Civil Service in the matter of the rules governing candidature for Parliament.   So long as the Fighting Services privileges were only known to apply to officers it might have been possible, though it would certainly rave been difficult, to defend the &quot;status quo&quot;, despite the anomaly, on historical grbunds.     But the explicit inclusion of non-oommissioned. personnel in the Admiralty and War Office makes the position irruch more difficult, and the Union of Postal Workers have not been slow to take the point, 10. In my opinion the existing position is not tenable;and as the eubjeot is far-reaching and of the first importance I recommend that It should be considered at the earliest possible moment by a strong Cabinet Committee,(Intd.)
