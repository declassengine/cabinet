SECRET. 13-4/23.CABINET.HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.WAR CHARGES (VALIDITY) BILL. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I am oiroulating this Bill again with tho view of obtaining a decision on an amendment consisting in the addition of tho words ohown In square brackets in Clause 1 (b).     I am personally in   favour of tho amondmont, firstly on tho general ground that, without it, a judgment given against the Crown, bofore the Bill becomes law, would moan tho disbursement of public money in damages, and secondly on the ground that if a litigant obtained a judgment before an arbitrary dato - that of tho passing of tho Act, - ho would be entitled to damages, and havo an unfair advantage as against another litigant whoso caBe had not concluded by tho date in question.Tho Attorney Gonoral to whom tho amendment has bo en shown, whilo agreeing to its form, desires to raiso the question of its advisability\ having regard to tho faot that it purports to override a judgment of tho Courts.(Intld.)
