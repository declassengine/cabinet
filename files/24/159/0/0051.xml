!PHB COMMUNISTS&apos; a report of *Wxa following is a copy of/an interview between        &apos;certain British communists, Clara aetkin and HerthaSturm in Moscow in December last:   this document wastaken from Minnie Biroh when she crossed the frontierinto Germany on her return from the Fourth Congress ofthe 1&apos;hird International.&quot;Comrade Zetkin was anxious that we should - increase our inf Itienoe among women in Trade unions and the labour Party.    There were many thousands of women in the latter organisation;   why was it that we were so out of touch with them?    2here were also the women in the Guild Sections of the Co-operative movement to consider.     With the influence in the political importance of the Party Binoe the return of Newbold to Parliament, the time was ripe for the building up of a strong, active and influential Yforaen&apos;s Section.     Special efforts must be made to influence responsible woman leaders in the trade Union world.     Special attention must be paid to the conditions under whioh women work within industry and also to the special home disabilities, so that all these grievances could be exploited and harnessed on behalf of Communism.     No matter in what sphere of activity woman appeared to be interested, such as, for instance, the cost of living, rent questions, unemployment etc. the Communists must be there, and through sensible appreciation and good leadership, serve to awaken in those women, rovolutionary consciousness and the need for Communist organisation.     She felt that the situation was advancing and we must be prepared to profit by it.     It was the Party&apos;s duty to the Communist International to pay strict sympathetic attention to these developments, and no Party could be a success inside or outside of England, that failed to take cognisance of the wcmsnTs influence and women1s needs.     Points were discussed and developed.&quot;Gomrade leckie put up the position on behalf &quot;of the Party re the Trade Unions and the Labour Party. He pointed out to Comrade Setkin that in proportion as we succeeded in penetrating the Labour party, to that extent did we also influence the Women&apos;b Sections.     There were important industrial centres, where Communists, while they might not be in the majority, exercised a majority influence and control, and that it was not correct to assume that because the Labour Party was endeavouring to olose their ranks to the Communist Party, the Communist Party was without influence over women in the frade Unions and the Labour Party machinery.     fhe same applies to the Co-operative Movement but in a much smaller degree.     He then described the forms of organisation and some of the accomplishments within the Rent Strike and Unemployment Movements.     This interested the German comrades very much, and they remarked that It was very regrettable that these things had not been reported to the proper centres and sufficiently broadcasted.     Comrade Leckie continueddealing/
dealing with the intern b 1 situation, describing ttxiiy financial crises and how drastically the staff had had to be reduaed.   They did not require much convincing to realise that it was impossible to develop the organisation of women so long as the Party was in its present starved and almost negleated condition.   We were not asking for anything but wo dia not want to be held criminally responsible for that whioh finances alone could overcome.   We were doing all that was humanly possible otherwise. We agreed that we could do more had we more assistance, but whether or not we had assistance, we would continue to do our best and we would thank the comrades for the suggestions that, we had made in that direction.&quot;Comrade Biroh also expressed her opinions.   She described how it was that Comrade Mrs. Crawfurd required to go home north,   she again described the work that had been undertaken at the training centre. She agreed with Comrade aetkin anent the necessity of (a) a Women&apos;e Council or headquarters situated in Loncton, with a representative on the Party Executive,  (b) permanent officials, not necessarily paid, but for the sake of correspondence etc., at least with permanent addresses.     Concluding she pointed out the smallness of the membership and the conditions that we were working under, and in general supplemented Comrade Leokie&apos;s remarks.&quot;Comrade Murphy in his contribution, referred to a number of good comrades located at different points up and down the country, mentioning Wales, Glasgow and the Midlands.   These comrades could have made a desirable women&apos;s Council or headquarters, but from a financial point of view it was impossible to bring them together.   On important business it would be necessary to do so at later intervals.   Meantime, with a Council composed of the best materials inside the London area it would be possible to carry on and to hernes3 these comrades already referred to in them respective localities, making of each a live organising centre.   He asked Comrade Zetkin to realise the Path which the Party had travelled, that not only, had there been external difficulties, but also there had been internal difficulties that only now could it be said that the Party was unified and consolidated, but it also had to be admitted that it was considerably weakened in numbers.   He urged that the best consideration be given the Party, and that so far as the Women&apos;a section wag concerned, on his return to England he would do his utmost to see that it was givenwevery consideration possible/&quot;Comrade Sturm expressed her pleasure at having met the English representatives.   She thought that much of the misunderstanding was the result of lack of contact and bad means of communication.   She thought that the Party Organ &quot;The Communist&quot; should provide more facility for the Women1e section.   Further it was desirable that the European Movement should bekept/
kepi; better informed on the development of conditions in Britain.   To that end she advised that periodical articles be contributed to &quot;Inpreoor&quot;.   She felt that the immediate reaction of suoh a practice would be considerably in our favour,   ohe expressed her willingness to do what she could for the English comrades.&quot;Comrade leckie again spoke.   He expressed the pleasure of the English delegation with the&apos; interview afforded them.   He asked Comrades 3etkin and Sturm now that all had been explained to them concerning the difficulties confronting the Party in England, would they pledge themselves to do what they could to assist the organisation in its great uphill fight. -Mistakes racy have been made but there now existed a bigger oonsciousness and real desire for revolutionary accomplishment.&quot;Comrade Zatkinj in her closing remarks, said she had written to England many times but had received no reply.   She had almost come to feol that the&apos; Party in England was indifferent so far as the Women&apos;s Question was concerned.   she was glad to knew that this was not-so and predicted that the Party at last would begin to grow.    Intensive work must immediately be undertaken.   Organisers and Propagandists must be manufactured..   More attention must be given in the Press to the Women1!:; Movement.   A real and sympathetic attempt must be made by the P^rty to understand this question in all its aspects and the best assistance possible must be afforded to the women&apos;a Section. It was possible that she herself might know someone in london who might assist in translations and correspondence,.   She would like to assure the comrades with all her sincerity that she would do her best to have the Party assisted over its difficulties.   She was not in a position to make a material promise but eo far as her influence was concerned she would do what she could to have matters, put on a better basis. She wished the Party every success and hoped that our relationships in the near future would confer real and lasting benefit to the world revolutionary struggle^&quot;In connection with the recent report that llewbold was receiving a salary of  250 a year from Moscow, a reliable-correspondent now states that Hewbold told him that he hadbeen offered payment &quot;as the Soviet&apos;s representative inthe English Government&quot; but had refused to accept It ashis salary of  400 was sufficient.   While in Bus-siallewbold was asked to compile a list of names of members of theCommunist Party who could be invited to Moscow where theyare to be instructed in propaganda work,   It is proposed    to/&apos;
to invite them in three parties - about April, July and October.During his stay in Moscow Hewho1ft gave an interviewto the &quot;Isvestia&quot; in the course of which he said:&quot;The impression created, on the Labour Party by my election is twofold.   The more radical elements, with Lansbury at their head, are very satisfied with the results.   Lansbury sees in my victory a proof that decisive, emphatic demands do not frighten away the rank and file worker-elsetor.   The other part of the Labour party - the Lamsay Maodonald group - were very upset.   The leader of &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Opposition&apos; is not pleased to see next to him on his benches a Communist who at any moment may rise and disclose the plans and tendencies of the party towards compromise with the bourgeoisie and the betrayals of the proletariat.&quot;The political Bureau of the Communist Party is dissatisfied with the progress made in the formation of nuclei and insists that they must be set up immediately in &quot;work&quot;shops&quot;, trade union branches, trades councils and every branch of the workers&apos; movement.Members have been instructed to support the undermentioned candidates for trade union posts:-&quot;A.E.U. - Trade Union Congress.Com.

return from South Afrioo:   P. Thompson was in the chair and Nat Watkins made a short speech.   Tom Mann spoke for ahout two hours on labour conditions in south Africa and unemployment in this country to which he said that he intended to devote his attention.     little enthusiasm was shown and no questions were asked.Tom Mann is endeavouring to secure speaking engagement In the provinces:   his terms are &quot;Pare, ordinary hotel and  2 each meetings&quot;YOUNG COMMUNIST hEACUSThe anti-militarist week of the Young Communist League opened with a meeting in Trafalgar Square on March 12th which was attended by about 300 people:   the speakers were Gilbert, Smith, Goldsmith and Harry Young, alias Reginald Bishop.   The resolution, carried with 4 dissentients, was to the effect that the meeting, realising the immediate danger of a new Imperialist and Capitalist war, insisted on a united working-class front to prevent a new war being declared in the Imperial and Capitalist interests in Great Britain and other countries:   it also demanded the scrapping of the Versailles Treaty;   protested against the arrest of Italian communists, demanded their immediate release, proposed to do all in its power to prevent a now war, and called upon the General Trades Council and the labour Party to use their endeavours to settle quickly the problems of the Ruhr and the Near East.Other meetings have been held in the London Area but have not aroused the response for which their promoters hoped.   Part of the expenses of the anti-militarist campaign have been defrayed by the Executive Committee of the Young Communist International and documents recently obtained abroad prove that the leaflets and propagandaissued/
issued in this ecnurtrry--TCMm tA\^^ reflex of       04the instructions issued by Mosoow to all naitiej3*Q-JLe-a^ma*..^.,,MAY DAYPreparations for Labour celebrations on May Day have commenced and communists, as has been the case in previous years, are well to the fore:   73 delegates, representing several trade unions, as well as the Labour Party, Trades and Labour Councils, Communist Pwrty and Young Communist League attended the first meeting in London on March 3rd. The communists dominated the meeting and secured the election of four of their members as organisers:   Cant (East), Savage (North), W,A. Hill (South) and L.R. Hill (West): when no organisers were forthcoming for the North  West ana South West, (tent volunteered to find them from hie Party members.Three communists have been elected respectively chairman, secretary and treasurer of the Paisley and District May Day Committee.THE UNEMPLOYEDA mere huadful of hunger marchers remain in London and these ere expected to return home any day.At a meeting of the London and Home CountiesDivisional Council of the National Unemployed Workers&apos;Committee Movement attended by about 40 delegates and heldin London on February 22nd, the organiser stated that:-&quot;He had visited Ramsgate, Dover, Deal, Chatham, Gilllngham and Sheerness ana he had sent propagandists to most of the committees in the Division.   A number of oommittees went out of existence hut in most places a nuclei was there who were being kept in touch.   Road relief work in Kent hud the effect of weakening the Movement in that distriot.   There was plenty of scope for work in the ooaat towns hut owing to lack of local propagandists the tendency was for these committees to deteriorate,   Ee had attended Chatham on Unemployment Sunday and although a good attendance had supported the National Demands, theofficial/
official element; on the platform were very much upset, Dover haa been good during the winter months, but like most seaside towns were very weak in the summer months.   Lew Davis had been sent to Stoke Perry and District but this plaoe was very hard to organise owing to it being formed of many small villages.   A route had been mapped out for the propaganda tour, but owing to financial difficulties the same had not been carried out.   Ho had been able to get a section of the National Marchers to march through the South of tho Division and this had very good results, at least one new committee being formed.&quot;Cambridge had a good committee but same was under the control of the Workers&apos; Union.    He had pointed out to them that they oouia not become part of the National Unemp3oyed workers&apos; Committee Movement while they were controlled by the Workers&apos; Union.&quot;Ee the national Ivfcrch.   Although every London Committee had not fully appreciated same, in provincial districts this had had a good effect.   The General Council of the Trade Union. Congress had been forced, to recognise the National Unemployed Workers1 Committee Movement and were going to circularise all Trades Councils, for committees to be set up.&quot;On March 9th about 500 of the Edmonton unemployed assembled at a Mission Hall in Grove Street where relief  ; tickets are distributed weekly:   the men who were led by Measures and Manning protested against a reduction of relief to one of their number named Napier and became tery hostile.   Police were called in but the men dispersed when promised that the Superintendent Relieving Officer would personally investigate Napier&apos;s oase and, if necessary, grant additional relief until&apos;Muroh 13th.The Chief Constable informs&apos;me that at an unemployed meeting held in Glasgow at the beginning of March Thomas Hitman said:&quot;The unemployment question is going to be solved artificially,   You are going to gat a job cutting Johnny Turk&apos;s throat or the Ifrenchies&apos; throats, but if you were doing tho right thing it5s Bonar law&apos;a throat that should be out.   Who is your biggest enemy? tho Turksor the Town Council that is responsible for starving the women and children here?   You fought like hell from 1914 till 1918 for the country you have not got and tho Sing you don&apos;t want...   When the time comes and you get a nice new suit of khaki, a new rifle and bavonet, fight like hell but not in Prance orOurkey/
Turkey;   figlil; like hell here and shoot straight.   You havo not as much guts as the Indian coolies.   They were doing what is called pacifist action against the people who have been forced on them by the rotten capitalist system of this country and the police out there attacked them and the casualties were enormous, but they killed twenty-two of the dirty police.   It should have been two hundred and twenty-two;   and that&apos;B constitutionalism - kicking a man to death in the Southern Police Offioe, batoning a man to death in Govan, and five dirty hooligans of police and four Sheriff Officers evicting a working class family on to the streets in this weather, and then going back into the house end stealing fivepence off the mantlepiece: that&apos;s what happened at 52 Rose Street last Tuesday morning.   The sooner you start and think and act in that constitutional way the better for you.   The Ward Committee wrote to lord provost paxton to meet a deputation about evictions and he wrote back asking for data, and we gave him 22 evictions and 31 impending evictions, and he refused to meet the deputation on the grounds that there was not sufficient data.   It&apos;s not data he wants, but a brick with a rope attached - the midden.&apos; 1&quot;This Bpeech was reported by the Chief Constable to the Procurator Fiscal.IRISH RBVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES II?
