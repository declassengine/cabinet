1.       The Co;imri.tteeUia&amp;-under--cons.ider-ation&quot;suggested &quot;amendments to the Indian Military Requirements Report with regard to Indian! sat ion, CP.13(23).     The various proposals for Indianisation which had &quot;been put forward by the Government of India and also the views of the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on Indian Ililitary req.uiremev.tE were explained to the Committee.The view was generally held that the Government of India should be at liberty to Incianise up to 8 units of cavalry or infantry and that reference in the body of the Report on Indian military requirements to a future Dominion Army in India should be avoided.It was also considered-that the Government of India&apos;s suggestion that the Indianisat ion of these 8 units should be considered as a first step towards a general scheme of Indianisation for the whole of the Indian Army could not be accepted ancl that the Secretary of State for India should inform the &quot;Viceroy that no promise should be made of further Indianisation until these units had proved efficient in every way.TH3 CO^IITTEID agreed:-(l)    That the paragraph suggested in CP.13(23) for insertion after paragraph 137 of the I.CR. Report should &quot;be omitted, and(2)    That paragraph 138(a) should be amended to read . e follows:-&quot;We consider that a start should be me.de at once so as to give Indians a fair opportunity of proving that units officered by Indians will be efficient in every vay&quot;.   Accordingly in pursuance of the general policy laid down in the preamble tc the Government of India Act of 1919, we have decided that 8 units of cavalry or infantry be selected to be officered by Indians as no*r suggested by the Government of India.(3)   That the Secretary of State for India should, inform the &quot;Viceroy that no promise of further Indianisation should, be made until the 8 units referred to in (2) above had proved efficient in. every way.
IT3XLERY FOR     2.       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR I^DIA iiiiormed theCommittee tha.k certain, native -chiefs had asked to he allowed to raise batteries of soaera artillery intheir State forces;    this request the Government ofIndia had supported provided that the supply ofammunition was sufficiently safeguarded.   There was much to he said for strengthening the forces of thenative chiefs who were a mainstay of the British rule in India, &quot;but if modern guns were issued to theNative States there weuld undoubtedly be a demandfor the formation of Indian artillery batteries in theregular Indian Army.After a short discussion the Committee agreed:-That the Native Chiefs should not be allowed to raise batteries armed with modern artillery.AZIRISTAN.        3y       THE SECRETARY OF SI ATE FOR II-DIA informed the Committee of the various policies with regard to 9/aziristan which had been recommended by the Government of India.A definite policy for the military occupation of-Waziristan and the construction of certain strategic reads had been under discussion for about 18 months and a final scheme had been accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Gdvernment in September, 1922,        a considerable amount of work in connection with this scheme had been completed.     The Government of India now, owing to the unsatisfactory financial situation, wished to curtail the road programme and make other changes in the accepted policy and they recommended that a Commission should be sent out from England to go into the whole question of frentia- policy..A discussion arose in which it was pointed out that if such a .Commission were appointed its main function would&apos; anly be to decide, on the construction
cr otherwise- of some miles of road;   and it was probable- that the whole situation would deteriorateowing to the feeling of insecurity which would ariseduring the investigation of this Commission; - theview was also held that since so much money had nowbeen expended on the road system and the military occupation was proving effective, the present policy should &quot;be continued.TEG COmhlTTiikD agreed:-(l)   That the&apos; request of the Government of India for a Commission to examine fr-oniia? policy- should aot be aseeded to.(2) That the present policy with regard to Wasiristan should be carried out with vigour and determination.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.7.1. 25th January, 1923-
