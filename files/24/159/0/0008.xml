THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEIfflliENT.HOkEi AFFAIRS COLiLITTSB. iimPVW&amp;WQjQl-Me, Segrjst aryf qxl&amp;^MmL.1.    On 7th February the Committee agreed /T2nd. Conclusions (23j7  to recamend to the Cabinet (1) that every effort should be made to pass certain Bills before the Easter Recess:   (2) that certain other Bills should, if possible, be given a Second Reading before the Easter   &apos; Recess.    In approving this recommendation on 8th February the Cabinet added, to class (2) &apos;if possible the London Financial Provisions Bill&apos;.2.    The Bill thus added is a measure which is to continue the powers both of the London Financial Provisions Act and of the Scottish Poor Law Emergency Provisions Act, 1921,    The.continuance of the latter is especially urgent and I doubt whether the situation would be satisfactorily met merely by a Second Reading before Easter,3.    The existing Scottish powers expire on 15th Hay next, and. it is essential that tney should be renewed before that date.    The Scottish poor law authorities could not legally, if the powers were allowed to lapse, continue relief to the able-bodied after 15th Llay, and as many of them are opposed to continuance of the. powers they would,   . no doubt, cease to give relief and a serious situation would arise.4.    in,any event, I expect considerable opposition to the Scottish clause of the Bil] at the instance of the poor law authorities.    It is inexpedient from the . Parliamentary point of view to allow the Bill to be carried over the Easter Recess, because this would give more time for the organisation of opposition,    I have discussed the flatter with the minister of Health, who is anxious that the London Provisions in the Bill should&apos;be passed as soon as possible though they are not so urgent as the Scottish provisions.    The Minister concurs in the proposal which I submit for &quot;the consideration of the Home Affairs Cosraittee at their next meeting, that the Cabinet should be recor/mended to add this Bill to class (1), naiely. Bill&quot; which every effort should be i/nade to pass before&quot; the Easter Recess.COPY NO.10E, C R E T.CP. 108 (25).CABINET(Signed)    NOVAR.Scottish Office,Whitehall, &apos; S.i/. 1.17th February, 1923.
