-HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.iECRETi &apos;.P.176 (25) .CABINET.SURFACE DAMAGE CAUSED BY MINING.68Note by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate a Memorandum by the Secretary for Mines.It is essential that the Cabinet should give a decision on this question before the 12th April, as the West Riding Drainage Bill has been set down for second reading on that date, and on the following day a Private Members Bill dealing with subsidence generally is third order.     The first Bill (Cotton Levy) on the latter day is non-contentious.     The second. Bill (Rating of Sewers) is I understand contentious, but it is- not possible to guarantee that it will run all day.     In these circum-; stances it will, I think, be impossible for the Government to avoid making a pronouncement as to its intentions.P. L1.-G. 29 *3 *J2t3 *
SURFACE DAMAGE CAUSED BY MUJIHG.Memorandum! by Secretary for Mines. S8th Maroh, 1925.The prospect of a Second Reading debate on April 12th on the West Riding Drainage Bill renders it desirable that the Government should determine before that date what is their policy on tho general question of the amendment of the law relating to damage caused by subsidence consequent on mining operations.Apart from special statutory provisions relating to statutory undertakings such as Railways, Canala, etc., the4present law, shortly stated, is that the ownership of land uninoumbered by buildings and in its natural state carries with it an absolute right of support, which may also be enlarged into an acquired right of support for the buildings on it.     At the same time, however, it is possible - and it is belioved to be a growing practice - for the mineral owner on parting with the surface to reserve the right   to let down the surface without liability, and for the nine owner on acquiring the right to v/ork minerals to acquire also, the same right, The result is that the surface owner acquires the land without any: right of support, and when damage results, from mining operations he has no remedy against any one.The West Riding Drainage Bill is designed primarily to make provision for the drainage of the district, and primarily therefore it concerns the ilinister of Agriculture and the Ministry of Health, who are understood generally to approve the proposals of the Bill.   Part 131, however, proposes that tho cost of any drainage necessitated by mining operations shall be paid by the mineral owners and the mine owners in
certain specified shares.   Whatever may bo the merits of this proposal on equitable grounds, it clearly does violence to existing legal rights, in that It ignores or overrides the rights which the mineral interests may have reserved or acquired as against the surface owners to let down the surface without liability.   It thereby raises and determines a question of principle which is of great importance to the mining industry generally, and has been the subject of muoh. discussion and consldoration as a national quostion for some years past. It was believod until recently that the private opposition to this Part of the  ill would be sufficient to secure Its withdrawal.   This, however, has proved not to the the case, and a motion to strike out Part III has accordingly been tabled by several influential members of the Kou3e.   It seems clearly improper that an alteration of this magnitude should be introduced into the law by means of incidental provisions in a private Bill affecting only one part of one mineral field.   On these grounds Part III of the Bill must, it is submitted, be opposed by the Government.It is almost inevitable, however, that If this line is taken the Government will be called upon to make some state-ment as to their policy on the general question of compenoa-tion for &quot;subsidence-damage&quot;, and their intentions of introducing.legislation to deal with it.-This is a matter which lias been exercising the minds of certain sections of tho community for some years part. Bills were introduced by Mr. Brace in 1919 and by Mr. Hirst in 19 0, under which it was proposed to collect a levy from all mineral owners and mine owners to form district compensation funds out of which to pay compensation for all surface damage due to mining.   The Government of the clay,
though, unable to accept the actual proposals in these Bills-, admitted the legitimacy of the grievance and undertook to introduce legislation of their own to remedy it.     That undertaking, through a series of parliamentary answers, gradually evaporated, and I have myself repeated the final statement of the late Government that I see no prospect of being able to introduce legislation on these lines.   There is no doubt, however, that, the demand for legislation on this subject has a considerable volume of opinion behind it. Resolutions have been received from scores of Local Authorities, questions continue to be asked in Parliament, a deputation recently came up from Stoke-on-Trent, and Mr. Hirst has introduced his 192o Bill again.     Moreover, there is a clause in the Mines (Working Facilities and Support) Bill (now through the House of Lords) which provides for the compulsory acquisition in certain circumstances of a right of support for buildings or works on the surface, and this clause though it is not likely to meet with actual opposition is fairly certain to be seized upon as an opportunity for questioning the Government as to their intentions on the question of imposing liability on the mineral interests for &quot;subsidence-damage,l0The proposals in Mr. Hirst&apos;s Bill are clearly inacceptable . They make no distinction in the amount of levy payable between the; differing degrees of risk of rmrface damage attaching to different mines, nor between cases in which the mine owner is at present liable and those in which he is not;    and in addition to paying a levy to a compensation fund, the mineral interests would in future in every case be liable at common law as well.It is difficult to suggest any satisfactory scheme.     The matter has been very fully considered in this Department and prolonged efforts were made to produce a satisfactory
G.R.L.FBill at the time when the late Government had promised one. Ono of the difficulties surrounding the subject is that though the situation is quite intelligible in the abstraot, no detailed information has ever been collected of the actual situation in the various mineral fields, from whioh a reliable estimate could be formed of the exact effect of the operation of any given scheme.The absence of such information not only has the disadvantage of reducing any refusal to adopt a privately promoted soheme almost entirely to grounds of abstract princlplo, but also would make it difficult for the Government to justify any soheme which they themselves might formulate. In view of the importance of the subject and the drastio change in the law which is in question, It seems desirable that in any oourse that the Government may pursue,whether in the promotion of legislation or the refusal of it, they should have before them the report of a Royal Commission.   My suggestion therefore, is that in the event of pressure being brought to bear, which renders a statement of the Governments intentions unavoidable, I should be authorised to say that a Royal Commission will be appointed to report upon the whole question.
