m Referred toCommittee of Horre Affair?This document 10 the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;sGovernment.SECRET.O.P. 195 (23).      POST OFFICE BILL:   giRgLg^gS^T^ABROAD.Memorondum by the Postmaster General.I desire to introduce a Bill, a draft of whioh is annexed, to prevent the posting abroad of Circulars emanating from British Firms for British addressee.     Owing to currency depredation the postage rates in oertain foreign oountrlos are extremely low, and the profit on posting large quantities is therefore considerable.     In&amp;smuoh as the country of origin retains the postage collected, the British Post Offioe has to effect delivery and loses the corresponding revenue.The British Inland rate for a circular is ^d. At the current rates of exohange the charge on oiroularsaddressed to this country and posted in Franoe is about id.,1 1 3in Germany about yd. and In Austria about gd.     In 1922over 5,000,000 oirculars were thus posted and the practiceshows no sign of diminution.The loss of revenue is not in the aggregate very considerable, but the receipt of these packets irritates the-public and enoouragee advertisers to have their printing as well ao posting done abroad to tho detriment of the British Printing industry.The Bill will give the Post Office power to charge the Inland rate in addition to the foreign postage, and in default of payment to destroy the clroulars.    Similar meaeuroa have been taken in some of the continental countries whioh experlenoe the same difficulty.W. Joynson Kicks.16   April, 1923.
