P. 173 (23). .   , &quot;   &apos; ;.,&apos; AL13ERNSY, (TRANSFER .OF PROPERTY) BILL. - i j?:Memorandum hy the Home Secretary. 540This is a measure designed to enable various Government Departments who own property and are responsible for certain local services In the Island of Alderney to transfer the property and services to the Island legislature]    The immediate occasion for the change arises from the fact that the Admiralty, which had built and was responsible for the maintenance of the breakwater, came to the conclusion last year that as this breakwater is no longer necessary for the purposes of national defence, they could not continue to provide from Havy Votes the expenditure necessary for its repair,,   The maintenance of the breakwater is, however essential to the Island as it provides the only practicable harbour; and for the present the Office of Woods, which administers the Crown lands in the Island^ has taken over the Admiralty functions.For the sake., however, of administrative economy in Government Departments here and also for the sake of encouraging the islanders to take a larger share in the responsibility of local Government, it is -desirable to transfer to the States of Alderney the property at present held by the Offioe of Woods, together with the responsibility for certain local services now financed out of the revenue derived from that property and also certain property owned by the War Office.   A scheme of devolution has been worked out in consultation between the Lieutenant Governor, the Home Office, the Treasury and the Departments concerned and   -has been accepted by the States.    It is proposed as soon as the Bill passes to make Orders in Council for giving effect to the scheme.The facts that the Office of Woods is at present exercisingtho administrative duties with regard to the harbour for which theAdmiralty is legally responsible and that the States have acceptedthe transfer scheme and are awaiting its being put into effect makeit desirable to pass the requisite legislation without delay.W. C, B.?th March,  1923.
