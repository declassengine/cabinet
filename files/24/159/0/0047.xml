Secret.CP. 147(23),15CABINET.Reduction of certain War Pensions and Allowances.Memorandum by the Minister of Pensions,The Government decided In November last that, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 24(a) of the Royal Warrant of 1919, no reduction should be made in &quot;flat-rate disablement pensions, widows&apos; and dependants&apos; pensions&quot; for another three years, i.e., that there should be no alteration before April, 1926, The grounds on which this decision was based are stated in the announcement which I was authorised to make on behalf of the Government and of which I attach a copy.The pledge thus given dees net cover(a) Alternative Pensions; and(b) the allowances paid to pensioners during treatment and training,and, unless a contrary decision Is now given, the reductions in the rates of these grants, in accordancewith the fall in the cost of living, should be effectedas from 1st April of this year.The saving which might be obtained by making these reductions is estimated at about three quarters of a million, but the issues of policy involved are so important that I must ask for a decision of the Cabineton the action to be taken.In(THIS DOOUMBNT IS THE PROPERTY QP^HIS BRITANNIC
mIn theory and, indeed.,, also from the purely administrative- point of view, there are strong arguments for reducing Alternative Pensions and, more especially, for cutting down Treatment Allowances, which the Geddes Committee were probably right In criticising as having been fixed on too generous a scale in 1919.      After careful consideration, however, I have come to the conclusion that the interests of Pensions policy as a whole, and ultimately of economy itself, will be best served by postponing any re-adjustment of these pensions and allowances for the present.The principle which has hitherto &quot;been adopted in Pensions administration has been to provide a liberal scale of benefits in cash and in medical treatment, and, at the same time, tc insist on a strict, though fair, interpretation of the provisions of the War Pensions Acts and Warrants.      I consider this principle to be sound.      At any rate, on the occasions on which the pensions policy of the Government has been generally challenged, it has hitherto secured the approval of Parliament and of public opinion,       By its application^ great and progressive reductions of expenditure have been and are being secured, but caution will be necessary if the confidence of the public and of the ex-service men, which is indispensable to the success of Pensions administration, is to be retained.In a new Parliament the number of critics of the Ministry is much Increased; unemployment and other difficulties add to the pressure in individual oases.       The administrative reforms of the Act of 1921 with the resulting increase of control,heavy
heavy reductions of staff and closing of superfluous local offices, the operation, as the War becomes more remote, of time limits on admission tc various classes of pension, the progress of the scheme of final awards at necessarily reduced rates, all multiply occasions for criticism.It is more than ever important that nothing should be done now to promote a re-action of public feeling which might not only check the natural progress of reduction but .even endanger what has already been attained.The fall in expenditure shewn by the Pensions Ministry Estimates tc be presented tc Parliament this year is no less than  16,000,000. A reduction of Alternative Pensions and. Treatment Allowances made at this moment would certainly be associated with this large reduction and interpreted everywhere as meaning that the Government for the sake cf economy have resolved arbitrarily to cut down War Pensions and Allowances.       There will be strong protests from all parties which will receive popular stipport.       In view of the pledges very freely given by members of all parties during the Election it may even be found impossible to get the reductions through the House of CoiTimons - a result which would be disastrous from every point of view., There is, however, another reason - in my opinion at least equally important - for postponing action.     It is undoubtedly in the public interest that, a final settlement of the rates of all pensions and allowances, which shall be fair both to the State and to the pensioner, should be arrived at as soon as possible,     Such a settlement is greatly desired by the ex-service man and, on afavourable
I therefore recommend:-(a) that no reduction should be made in the present year in any of the grants or allowances authorised by the Royal Warrants and(b)KThese recommendations cover a suggestion made by the Treasury that a reduction should be made in the bonus cf 20% which Is granted under Article 1(3)(a) to officers in receipt of wound pension and on half-pay.   The grant of bonus in those cases, although subject to the limitation that the aggregate amount received by the officer shall not exceed  300 a year, results, In many Instances, in the award of an excessive amount of pension to these officers by comparison with officers disabled tc the same extent by disease,.     But any reduction that could be made now on the basis of the cost of living could not, I am advised, secure a saving of more than about  12,000 a year.     The reduction would affect only certain special awards made solely to officers wounded during, their, service who have a strong claim on public sympathy while the bonus, m other oases would remain untouched,favour-able opportunity, a comprehensive arrangement could probably be secured by consent, under which not only Alternative Pensions and Treatment Allowances but other provisions of the Warrant could be re-adjusted. Por the reasons given in announcing the stabilisation of the flat-rate pensions until 1926, it is not possible to negotiate an arrangement of this kind immediately, but I see nc reason why it should hot be brought about within the next two years within which time it is expected that the process of making final awards of pension will be nearing completion and the whole future of War Pensions and their administration will have to be re---considered.To insist on a partial re-adjustment now, in my opinion will not only produce serious Parliamentary difficulties with, at the best, most unfavourable re-acticns on administration, but will prejudice the success of the definitive and advantageous settlement of all pensions questions which it is our object to attain during the lifetime of the present Parliament.35 e.c. 0MM8NDATIONS i
(b) that the question of making suohreductions should be further considered in a year!s time as part of a general scheme for the final settlement of rates of air pensions and. allowances.(Signed)   G. G. TRYON.Minister of Pensions.Ministry of Pensions.13th Maroh, 1923,
REVISION OP THE RATES OF/PENSION 1925. -. 370EXTRACT FROM SPEECH BY MAJOR TRYON, MINISTER ^JdP^^j^* A^y^IQHT0N*A matter of supreme importanoe to every pensioner at the moment is doubtless the question whether there Is to be a reduction in the rates of pension next April as provided for by the Royal Warrant on account of the decreased cost of living.       The Government have given this question their most &quot;Careful consideration and I am authorised by the Prime Minister tc convey to you their decision.     I know it will be reassuring to pensioners.The Government have decided that the present rates of flat rate disablement pensions, widows&apos; and dependants&apos; pensions, shall not be reduced next year but shall be stabilised for a further three years.Let me tell you the reasons which in my judgment, and in the judgment of the Government, make this decision a right one.In the Warrant of 1919 a definite relation was laid down between the rates of pension and the cost cf living, but as constant changes of rat^s are Impossible administratively, the rates were fixed in 1919 for the three and a half years which end on the 31st March next.       It has so happened that during the greater part of these three and a half years, owing tc still further increase in the cost of living during the first two years of it, the arrangement turned out somewhat to the disadvantage of the pensioner.       The arrangement now proposed by the Government, coupled with the present fall in the cost of living, will be a reasonable adjustment of the matter.In
In deciding on a further period of three years&apos;, the Government were also moved&apos; by the consideration that the factors governing prices, and the cost of living were still so far from being stable that it might well be unfair to pensioners to fix the rates of pension for more than three years In advance on the basis of the present cost of living.The decision of the Government is one that, as I have said, I personally welcome very heartily.      While I recognise, as everyone does recognise, and as ex-service men themselves asked in 1919, that the rates of pension should correspond in reasonable measure with the rise or fall in the cost of living, I do not consider that at the present time under present conditions the existing rates of pension are too high.
