[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.jPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 1923.SECRET.- 13CP. 106 (23).CABINET.PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I CIRCULATE for the consideration of the Cabinet a Memorandum prepared in the Colonial Office on the subject of British policy in Palestine. I think it important that a definite statement on this subject should be made on behalf of the Government with as little delay as possible. I suggest that the matter should be considered by the Cabinet at an early date with a view to a decision being reached on the following points :  1. Is there anything in the British Governments pledges to the Arabs that pre-cludes elect being given to the Balfour Declaration in favour of settingup a National Home for the Jews in Palestine? 2. If the answer is in the negative, are we to continue the policy of the late government in giving effect to the Balfour Declaration on the lines laiddown in the White Paper of June 1922? 3. If not, what alternative policy are we to adopt?DEVONSHIRE.Colonial Office,11th February, 1923.[9523]
POLICY IN PALESTINE.I. The Commitments.1. BRITISH policy in Palestine during the last five years has been based upon the Balfour Declaration of November 1917. This Declaration was embodied in a letter from Lord Balfour, then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to Lord Rothschild, which was published in the press at the time of its issue. It was in the following terms: &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a National Home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly under-stood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.&quot;2. A paper has already been circulated to ,the Cabinet (CP. 60 (23)), summarising the history of the negotiations that led up to the Balfour Declaration and the considerations of policy on which the Declaration was based. There is no need to repeat the story here. Briefly stated, the object was to enlist the sympathies on the Allied side of influential Jews and Jewish organisations all over the world. It was hoped to counteract the efforts of the German Government to capture the sympathies of the Zionist movement, and to pave the way for effective propaganda in Russia and America. It is arguable that the negotiations with the Zionists, which had been in progress for many months before the Declaration was actually published, did, in fact, have considerable effect in advancing the date at which the United States Government intervened in the war. However that may be, it must always be remembered that the Declaration was made at a time of extreme peril to the cause of the Allies. Our offensive of the previous summer and autumn had resulted in enormous casualties and had failed to achieve any decisive result. Italy was in extremis. Russia had dropped out of the alliance, and the Germans were busily engaged in transferring Army Corps from the Eastern to the Western front in pre-paration for the grand attack which, in the spring of 1918, was to sweep the British and French armies into the seas. How narrowly the Germans failed in their object is a matter of history. The point is worth emphasising, because it is often repre-sented that the Zionist policy was a mere fad of the late Government and (to quote Lord Sydenham&apos;s words) &quot; one of the many legacies of evil which the Coalition has r bequeathed.&quot; This view cannot possibly be sustained. The policy is a legacy, not of Mr. Churchill or of the Coalition, but of the Great War. The Balfour Declaration was a war measure, taken by the War Cabinet (of which Mr. Churchill was not a member) after full deliberation at a time when the military situation was exceedingly critical, and designed to secure certain tangible benefits which it was hoped would contribute to the ultimate victory of the Allies. These benefits may or may not have been worth securing, and may or may not have been actually secured; but the objec-tions to going back on a promise made under such conditions are obvious. The Jews would naturally regard it as an act of baseness if, having appealed to them in our hour of peril, Ave were to throw them over when the danger was past. That is how they would put it, and it is difficult to see what adequate defence could be made.3. The policy of the Balfour Declaration was accepted by the Principal Allied Powers (Great Britain, France, Italy ,and Japan) at the San Remo Conference in April 1920. A representative of the United States was also present. At the same Conference it was decided that the Mandate for Palestine should be assigned to Great Britain. The text of the Declaration was embodied verbatim in the Treaty of Sevres (August 1920), which was signed by Great Britain and the Dominions (including India), France, Italy, Japan, Armenia, Belgium, Greece, Poland, Portugal, Roumania, Serbia, Czechoslovakia and Turkey. It was also embodied verbatim in the draft Mandate for Palestine which was submitted, to the League of Nations in December 1920. The terms of the draft Mandate were eventually approved with some modifications (not affecting the policy of the Declaration) by the Council of the League of Nations in July 1922. The Powers represented on the Council were Great [9523] b 2
Britain, France, Italy, Japan, China, Belgium, Spain and Brazil. The Mandate is not yet actually in operation, though it has been finally approved by the Council. There are still some outstanding differences between France and Italy relating to the terms, not of the Mandate for Palestine, but of the Mandate for Syria. As it was considered desirable by the Council that the two Mandates should come into operation simultaneously, it was decided that the Palestine Mandate should be held in abeyance until the Franco-Italian differences had been resolved. In the meantime we are acting upon a letter, dated the 3rd October, 1921, from the President of the Council, inviting us to &quot; continue to carry on the administration of the territories committed &quot;to our charge .... in the spirit of the draft Mandates until such time as the &quot; position shall have been definitely regularised.&quot; It may here.be added that on the 3rd May, 1922, a joint resolution in the following terms was passed by the United States Congress : &apos;: Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the &quot; United States of America in Congress assembled that the United States of America &quot; favours the establishment in Palestine of the National Home for the Jewish people, &quot; it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the &quot; civil and religious rights of non-Jewish communities in Palestine, and that the Holy &quot; Places and religious buildings and sites in Palestine shall be adequately protected.&quot;4. We are, in fact, committed to the Zionist policy before the whole world in the clearest and most unequivocal fashion.5. The terms of the Mandate take us a step further than the original Declara-tion. Article 2 makes usresponsible for placing the country under such political, &quot;administrative and economic conditions as will secure the establishment of the &quot; Jewish National Home.&quot; Under Article IV of the Mandate a special position is accorded to the Zionist Organisation, which is to be recognised (so long as its organisation and constitution are in the opinion of the Mandatory appropriate) &quot; as &quot; a public body for the purpose of advising and co-operating with the Administration &quot; of Palestine in such economic, social and other matters as may affect the establish-&quot; ment of the Jewish National Home and the interests of the Jewish population in &quot;Palestine, and, subject always to the control of the Administration, to assist and &quot; take part in the development of the country.&quot; Under Article XI, the Administra-tion is authorised to arrange with the Jewish Agency in question (i.e., the Zionist Organisation) &quot; to construct or operate upon fair and equitable terms any public &quot; works, services and utilities, and to develop any of the natural resources of the &quot; country in so far as these matters are not directly undertaken by the Administra-&quot; tion.&quot; The same Article provides that the profits distributed by such Agency are not to exceed a reasonable rate of interest on capital, and that any further profits shall be utilised by it for the benefit of the country in a manner approved by the Administration. It may be observed that these conditions have been literally fulfilled in the terms of the much-criticised Rutenberg concession.6. The Zionist Organisation is an international Jewish body with headquarters in London, under the Presidency of Dr. Weizman. It has established an Agency at Jerusalem for the purpose of carrying out the functions allotted to it under the Mandate. The local body is known as the &quot;Zionist Executive.&quot; The Organisation was selected by His Majesty&apos;s Government for the purpose as the best representative of the Jewish movement as a whole.7. It is constantly argued by critics of the Zionist policy that, whatever may have been the pledges given to the Jews, they are rendered null and void by prior promises made to the Arabs. The facts are as follows : In the course of the corre-spondence which preceded the Arab revolt, Sir HMcMahon, then High Commissioner in Egypt, gave an undertaking (25th October, 1915) to the Sherif of Mecca (now King Hussein of the Hejaz) that His Majesty&apos;s Government would &quot;recognise and &quot; support the independence of the Arabs &quot; within certain territorial limits. From these limits &quot; the districts of Mersina and Alexandretta and the portions of Syria &quot;lying to the west of the districts of Damascus, Hama, Homs^and Aleppo&quot; were specifically excluded. The relevant extracts from the correspondence between Sir H. McMahon and the Sherif are printed as Appendix I to this Memorandum. The question is: Did the excluded area cover Palestine or not ? The late Government maintained that it did and that the intention to exclude Palestine was clearly under-stood, both by His Majesty&apos;s Government and by the Sherif, at the time that the
correspondence took place. Their view is supported by the fact that in the following year (1916) we concluded an agreement with the French and Russian Governments under which Palestine was to receive special treatment-on an international basis. The weak point in the argument is that, on the strict wording of Sir H. McMahon&apos;s letter, the natural meaning of the phrase &quot; west of the district of Damascus &quot; has to be somewhat strained in order to cover an area lying considerably to the south, as well as to the west, of the City of Damascus.8. The question bec?jne one of acute controversy during the recent visit of the Palestine Arab Delegation. It was therefore thought desirable to consult Sir H. McMahon personally.  He wrote as follows on the 12th March, 1922: &quot; With reference to our conversation on Friday (10th) I write you these few lines to place on record the fact that in my letter of the 25th October, 1915, to the Sherif of Mecca, it was my intention to exclude Palestine from, independent Arabia, and I hoped that I had so worded the letter as to make this sufficiently clear for all practical purposes. My reasons for restricting myself to specific mention of Damascus, Hama, Horns and Aleppo in that connection in my letter were (1) that these were places to which the Arabs attached vital importance, and (2) that there was no place I could think of at the time of sufficient import-ance for purposes of definition further south of the above. It was as fully my intention to exclude Palestine as it was to exclude the more northern coastal tracts of Syria. I did not make use of the Jordan to define the limits of the southern area because I thought it might possibly be considered desirable at some later stage of negotiations to endeavour to find some more suitable frontier line east of the Jordan and between that river and the Hejaz Railway. At that moment, moreover, any detailed definitions did not seem called for. I may mention that I have no recollection of ever hearing anything from the Sherif of Mecca, by letter or message, to make me suppose that he did not also understand -Palestine to be excluded from independent Arabia. I trust that I have made my intention clear.&quot;9. The late Government on two occasions made an explicit pronouncement on this point.(1.) The statement of policy included in the White Paper of June 1922 con-tained the following passage : &quot;It is not the case, as has been represented by the Arab Delegation, that during the war His Majesty&apos;s Government gave an undertaking that an inde-pendent national Government should, be at once established in Palestine. This representation mainly rests upon a letter dated the 25th October, 1915, from Sir Henry McMahon, then His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner in Egypt, to the Sherif of Mecca, now King Hussein of the Kingdom of the Hejaz. That letter is quoted as conveying the promise to the Sherif of Mecca to recognise and support the independence of the Arabs within the territories proposed by him. But this promise was given subject to a reservation made in the same letter, which excluded from its scope, among other territories, the portions of Syria lying to the west of the district of Damascus. This reservation has always been regarded by His Majesty&apos;s Government as covering the Vilayet of Beirut and the independent Sanjak of Jerusalem. The whole of Palestine west of the Jordan was thus excluded from Sir H. McMahons pledge.&quot;(2.) In a reply to a question in the House of Commons on the 11th July, 1922, Mr. Churchill made the following statement: &quot; No pledges were made to the Palestine Arabs in 1915. An undertaking was given to the Sherif of Mecca that His Majesty&apos;s Government would recog-nise and support the independence of the Arabs within certain territorial limits, which specifically excluded the districts of Mersina and Alexandretta and the portions of Syria lying to the west of the districts of Damascus, Horns, Hama and Aleppo. It was also stipulated that the undertaking applied only to those portions of the territories concerned in which Great Britain was free to act without detriment to the interests of her Allies. His Majesty&apos;s Government, have always regarded, and continue to regard, Palestine as excluded bv these provisos from the scope of their undertaking.  This is clear from the fact, to
543correspondence took place. Their view is supported by the fact that in the following year (1916) we concluded an agreement with the French and Russian Governments under which Palestine was to receive special treatment&apos;on an international basis. The weak point in the argument is that, on the strict wording of Sir H. McMahon&apos;s letter, the natural meaning of the phrase &quot; west of the district of Damascus &quot; has to be somewhat strained in order to cover an area lying considerably to the south, as Well as to the west, of the City of Damascus.8.

The statement of policy included in the White Paper of June 1922 eon-tained the following passage : &quot;It is not the case, as has been represented by the Arab Delegation, that daring the war His Majesty&apos;s Government gave an undertaking that an inde-pendent national Government should be at once established in Palestine. This representation mainly rests upon a letter dated the 25th October, 1915, from Sir Henry McMahon, then His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner in Egypt, to the Sherif of Mecca, now King Hussein of the Kingdom of the Hejaz.

The whole of Palestine west of the Jordan was thus excluded from Sir H. McMahon&apos;s pledge.&quot;(2.) In a reply to a question in the House of Commons on the 11th July, 1922, Mr. Churchill made the following statement: &quot;No pledges were made to the Palestine Arabs in 1915. An undertaking was given to the Sherif of Mecca that His Majesty&apos;s Government would recog-nise and support the independence of the Arabs within certain territorial limits, which specifically excluded the districts of Mersina and Alexandretta and the portions of Syria lying to the west of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo. It was also stipulated that the undertaking applied only to those portions of the territories concerned in which Great Britain was free to act without detriment to the interests of her1 Allies. His Majesty&apos;s Government have^ always regarded, and continue to regard, Palestine as excluded bv these provisos from the scope of their undertaking.  This is clear from the fact, to
which the Hon. Member refers, that in the following year, they concluded an agreement with the French and Russian Governments under which Palestine was to receive special treatment.&quot; So far as I am aware, the first suggestion that Palestine was included in, the area within which His Majesty&apos;s Government promised to recognise and support the independence of the Arabs was made by the Emir Feisal, now King of Iraq, at a conversation held at the Foreign Office on the 29th January, 1921, more than five years after the conclusion of the correspondence on which the claim was based. On that occasion the point of view of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment was explained to the Emir, who expressed himself as prepared to accept the statement that it had been the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to exclude Palestine.&quot; When I assumed responsibility for Middle Eastern affairs, I went care-fully into the correspondence referred to, and my reading of it is the same as that of the Foreign Office, as was recently stated in the declaration of British policy in Palestine, which was published and laid before the House. I am quite satisfied that it was as fully the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to exclude Palestine from the area of Arab independence as it was to exclude the more northern coastal tracts of Syria.&quot;10. The terms of Mr. Churchill&apos;s statement of the 11th July, 1922, were framed in consultation with the Foreign Office, who were the Department responsible for the McMahon pledge. It must be remembered that Sir H. McMiahon&apos;s promise, what-ever may have been its precise scope, was made, not to the Arabs of Palestine, but to the Sherif of Mecca. Unlike the Balfour Declaration, it was not made public at the time and did not, in fact, become known to the Arabs of Palestine until after the war. There is therefore no question of our having induced them to fight for us by giving them an undertaking from which we have since receded. In point of fact, practically none of them did fight for us. This was admitted by the &quot; Times &quot; corre-correspondent in an article published in April 1922, at a time when the &quot; Times&quot; was anything but friendly to the late Government or its Middle Eastern policy. The correspondent wrote as follows : &quot; Most annoying to one who served with the British and Arab forces in the Palestine campaign are the pretensions of the Arabs of Palestine to have rendered important military services to the Allies in the Great War. The Trans-Jordanians and the He j azis .... played their part right well, but the Palestinians confined themselves to deserting in large numbers to the British, who fed and clothed and paid for the maintenance of many thousands of such prisoners of war, few, indeed, of whom could be induced to obtain their liberty by serving in the Sherifian army.&quot;11. There is another point worth mentioning in connection with the McMahon correspondence. Critics of British policy sometimes speak about a &quot; Treaty &quot; having been concluded with the Arabs in 1915. Nothing of the kind took place. It is true that the Sherif in the first letter of the series (14th July, 1915) drew up a list of what he called &quot; fundamental propositions,&quot; which might conceivably be regarded as the first draft of a convention; but no further progress was made in the direction of a formal agreement. What followed was a long and rather inconclusive correspon-dence which left many points still unsettled when the Sherif actually took the plunge and revolted against the Turks.12. Another document quoted by the Arabs in support of their contention is the so-called &quot; Allenby Proclamation.&quot; This Proclamation embodied the text of the Anglo-French Declaration of the 7th November, 1918, which is printed in the original French as Appendix 2 to this Memorandum. It was published by Lord Allenby throughout the area occupied by the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, which then extended from the Suez Canal to beyond Aleppo. The Declaration was in effect a promise to promote self-Government in the territories to which it referred. It will be seen that it does not mention Palestine, and purports explicitly to refer to Syria and Mesopotamia only. In any case the Declaration was issued after an armistice had been concluded with Turkey and cannot be quoted as an inducement held out to the Arabs to take our side in the Avar. Nor can it be regarded as 0A&apos;erriding the Balfour Declaration, Avhich preceded it by twelve months.
&quot;7 i13. Whatever may be thought of our case as based on the exact wording of the McMahon letter, it will probably be agreed that, on a broad view of the position, we have an effective answer to Arab criticism. What we promised was to promote Arab independence throughout a wide area. That promise we have substantially fulfilled. Hussein reigns as an independent sovereign at Mecca; Feisal rules at Baghdad; Abdullah in Trans-Jordan. Ibn Saud through his vast territories is free from all fear of Turkish interference or aggression. Further south, the Imam in the Yemen and the Idrisi in Asir rule over independent States. The Arabs as a whole have acquired a freedom undreamed of before the war. Considering what they owe to us, they may surely let us have our way in one small area, which we do not admit to be covered by our pledges, and which in any case, for historical and other reasons, stands on a wholly different -footing from the rest of the Arab countries. This aspect of the question was put forcibly by Lord Balfour in the House of Lords debate on the 21st June, 1922.  These were his words : &apos;&apos; Of all the charges made against this country, I must say that the charge that we have been unjust to the Arab race seems to me the strangest. It is through the expenditure largely of British blood, by the exercise of British skill and valour, by the conduct of British generals, by troops brought from&apos; all parts of the British Empire it is by them in the main that the freeing of the Arab race from Turkish rule has been effected. And that we, after all the events of the war, should be held up as those who have done an injustice; that we, who have just established a King in Mesopotamia, who had before that established an Arab King in the Hejaz, and who have done more than has been done for centuries past to put the Arab race in the position to which they have attained; that we should be charged with being their enemies, with having taken a mean advantage of the course of international negotiations, seems to me not only most unjust to the policy of this country, but almost fantastic in its extravagance.&apos;&apos;14. It is fair to say that the force of these arguments appear to be generally, recognised by the Arabs as a whole. The main burden of complaint comes, not from the Sherifian family, to whom our promises were given and who fought by our side in the war, but from the Palestinian Arabs (or a certain section of them), to whom we gave no promises and who did not fight at all. If anybody has a right to challenge our action in giving effect to the McMahon pledges, it is surely King Hussein himself, to whom these pledges were made. Yet King Hussein is actually in negotiation with us for the conclusion of a Treaty of Friendship, in which we have some hope of securing the inclusion of a clause definitely recognising our position in Palestine. It may be too much to hope that we can ever satisfy the Palestinian Arabs; but so long as the general body of Arab opinion is not against us, the dangers arising from local dissatisfaction ought not to be serious. The task of reconciling the local Arabs to the Zionist policy would have been much easier if political exigencies had not made it necessary to sever all connection between Syria and Palestine.II. The Late Governments Policy.15. Prior to 1921 no authoritative explanation was ever given of what precisely was meant by a &apos;&apos; National Home &apos;&apos; for the Jews. It is clear that there was some difference of opinion in the War Cabinet itself at the time when the Declaration was framed. Lord Curzon, in a memorandum dated the 26th October, 1917, laid down the following propositions as representing the maximum that could properly be aimed at: (a.) Set up some form of European administration (it cannot be Jewishadministration) in Palestine. (&amp;.) Devise a machinery for safeguarding and securing order both in the christian and in the Jewish Holy Places, (c.) Similarly guarantee the integrity of the Mosque of Omar and vest it insome Moslem body.(d.) Secure to the Jews (but not to the Jews alone) equal civil and religiousrights with the other elements in the population, (e.) Arrange as far as possible for land purchase and settlement of returningJews.
It is not clear whether the Cabinet as a whole took a similar view of the limitations of its policy. It is believed that the late Prime Minister once informed Dr. Weizman that what the Cabinet had meant was the establishment of a &quot;Jewish State.&quot; Whatever may have been the view of the Cabinet, it is quite certain that this is what the Jews themselves meant. They imagined, or chose to imagine, that there was to be a Jewish Kingdom of Palestine which would take its place among the nations of the world like any other national entity. Such an aspiration, as Lord Curzon had pointed out in the memorandum from which the above extract is quoted, was bound to bring them into conflict with the other local communities. The question, however, did not become acute for some considerable time. Palestine was a conquered country. Down to the&apos;middle of 1920 it remained under a purely military administration. On the 1st July, 1920, a civil administration was set up under a High Commissioner (Sir Herbert Samuel), responsible at first to the Foreign Office and subsequently to the Colonial Office. The form of administration was that of Crown Colony Government of a fairly primitive type. Since October 1920, the High Commissioner has been assisted by an Advisory Council, with purely consultative functions, consisting of ten unofficial members nominated by the High Commissioner himself and of ten members of the Administration. It was stated, when the Advisory Council was inaugurated, that its establishment was the first step in the development of self-governing institutions. The next step was taken in August 1922, when an Order in Council was issued conferring a new Constitution on Palestine, including a Legislative Council, partly nominated and partly elective. The new Constitution has not yet come actually into operation.16. The control of Palestine was transferred from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office in March 1921. Shortly afterwards the then Secretary of State (Mr. Churchill) visited, the country in person. It was by this time becoming evident that the local political situation was not satisfactory. The Jaffa riots early in May 1921 proved that the antagonism between Jew and Arab had reached danger point. Which party was chiefly to blame, need not be argued here. No doubt the exaggerated claims of the Jews did much to exasperate the Arabs; but so long as these claims were not formally disavowed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Jews could hardly be blamed for entertaining them. It had become necessary to give an authoritative explanation of the Balfour pledge. A formula was accordingly devised by the. Colonial Office and Sir Herbert Samuel in consultation, which disclaimed, by implication all intention of setting up, a Jewish State, and in effect confined thei policy within limits very similar to those advocated by Lord Curzon in October 1917. The terms of this formula, which was announced by Sir Herbert Samuel in a speech delivered, at Jerusalem on the 3rd June, 1921, were as follows : &apos;&quot;They [i.e., the words of the Declaration] mean that the Jews,.a people that are scattered throughout the world, but whose hearts are always turned to Palestine, should be enabled to found here their home, and that some among them, within the limits that are fixed by the numbers and interests of the present population, should come to Palestine in order to help by their resources and efforts to develop the country to the advantage of all its inhabitants.&quot;The same definition was repeated by Mr. Churchill in the House of Commons on the 14th June, 1921.17. The new formula did not. satisfy the Palestinian Arabs, who decided in the summer of 1921 to send a Delegation to England to present their case to His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Delegation arrived in England in August 1921 and remained in this country for almost exactly a year. Their exact position was that of representatives of a Moslem Christian Congress at Haifa. They were warned by the High Commissioner before leaving that they could not be regarded as an official Delegation, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government would not be prepared to treat formally with them. They had several interviews with Mr. Churchill of a more or less informal character, and were in constant communication with the Middle East Department throughout their stay. On one occasion they consented to attend an informal interview at the Colonial Office, at which representatives of the Zionist Organisation were also present. Stated briefly, the Delegation made two demands, viz. : 
(1.) The abrogation of the Balfour Declaration; and(2.) The immediate grant of representative government to Palestine.On the first point they were repeatedly told that no concession of principle could be made. On the second point is was made clear to them that full representative government was for the present out of the question, but that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment were prepared tq move in this direction and to make a start by creating a Legislative Council containing a representative element. This Council has actually been set up under the Order in Council of the 10th August, 1922, and the elections for it are about to take place.18. Every effort was made to induce the Delegation to abandon their demand for a formal reversal of policy and to discuss practical details as to the best method of safeguarding Arab interests under the Balfour Declaration. There were moments when the Delegation seemed to be wavering in their attitude, and it is believed that some at least of them would have been glad to come to terms with the British Govern-ment. Unfortunately, however, any impression produced by the arguments of the Colonial Office was nullified by the activities of their English friends and by the encouragement given to them by certain sections of the press. The result was that, though the personal relations between them and the Colonial Office were cordial, no material progress was made towards a political understanding.19. Sir Herbert Samuel visited England while the Delegation was here. As a result of personal consultation with him and of prolonged discussion and corre-spondence with the Delegation, a fresh statement of policy was issued in June 1922. The text of this statement and of the correspondence relating to it was published as a White Paper (Command 1700) last summer. Its main points were summarised in a telegram which is printed as Appendix 3 to this memorandum. The new statement made important advances towards meeting the Arab views. Under it His Majesty&apos;s Government (1) formally dissociated themselves from the extreme Zionist claims (in particular, they disavowed certain language attributed to Dr. Weizman, which had acquired wide publicity and had attracted much hostile criticism, to the effect that the object of the Zionist policy was to make Palestine &quot; as Jewish as England is &quot;English&quot;); (2) made it clear that the special position accorded to the Zionist Organisation under the Mandate did not involve any participation in the government of Palestine; and (3) undertook to make special arrangements (since embodied in the Order in Council) by which a Committee of the elected members of the Legislative Council (which must always include an Arab majority) is to have a direct voice in the control of immigration. The statement was referred in draft both to the Zionist Organisation and to the Arab Delegation. It was formally accepted by the former, whose letter of acceptance is printed in the White Paper. The attitude of the Zionist Organisation is noteworthy. The new statement involved a considerable abatement of their pretensions and was undoubtedly a bitter pill for them to swallow. The credit for their action must be ascribed to the statesmanlike influence of Dr. Weizman. The Arabs remained, and still remain, obdurate. Lord Sydenham has described the White Paper policy as one that no self-respecting Arab could accept; but a candid judgment will, it is hoped, see in it an honest attempt to hold the balance fairly between the conflicting interests and to devise a plan that will do adequate justice to the claims of both.020. The Parliamentary history of the Zionist policy has been somewhat chequered. On the 21st June, 1922, the Government was defeated in the House of Lords (by 60 votes to 29) on a motion introduced by Lord Islington, declaring the Palestine Mandate to be inacceptable in its present form, and recommending the postponement of its acceptance by the Council of the League of Nations until it had been modified in such a way &quot; as will comply with the pledges given by His Majesty&apos;s &quot; Government.&quot; The verdict of the House of Lords was reversed in the House of Commons on the 4th July, 1922, when a motion by Sir W. Joynson-Hicks was defeated by an overwhelming majority (292 votes to 35). Sir W. Joynson-Hicks&apos;s motion demanded (1) submission of the Mandate for the approval of Parliament, and (2) the reference of the Rutenberg Concession to a Select Committee. Mr. Churchill, in his reply, treated the question as one of confidence, as affecting the whole policy[95231 ,    \ C        i
of the Government in Palestine, and asked the House &quot; to attach significance to this &quot; vote because of the adverse vote recorded in the House of Lords a few days ago.&quot; The Labour Party has always supported the Zionist policy. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald made a fresh pronouncement in its favour quite recently.III. The Present Position.21. The present political situation in Palestine was fully discussed in the despatch from Sir H. Samuel of the 8th December last, which has already been circulated to the Cabinet (CP. 4379). To outward appearance, at any rate, the country is more tranquil at the present moment than at any time since the war. There has been no disturbance of the peace since the abortive outbreak at Jerusalem in November 1921. In the British Gendarmerie introduced into the country in April 1922 the Administration has an effective instrument for dealing promptly with any sign of internal trouble that may present itself. The apprehensions that the return of the Delegation from London empty-handed might prove the signal for violent demonstration was not fulfilled. It remains to be seen whether the Arabs will act upon their threat to boycott the elections for the Legislative Council. That the elections will give rise to active disorder does not seem to be feared. There are indications that the Arab population as a whole, apart from the political leaders and agitators, are likely to show a reasonable degree of acquiescence in the present regime, once they are satisfied that that regime is to be maintained and that further agitation will be fruitless. Apart from the Zionist question, which infects the whole political atmosphere, the present Administration is not unpopular. It has conferred various benefits upon the country which are widely appreciated. Sir Herbert Samuel is personally regarded with general respect and even affection, while his strict sense of justice is admitted on all hands. When our critics are asked to give concrete examples of injustice or oppression on the part of the Palestine Government, they have very little to say. They prefer as a rule to take refuge in generalities. Palestine, as we are often reminded, is a small country, with about the same area as Wales, and with a population of under a million. Provided that it is secure from external attack, the task of governing it need not be regarded as one of insuperable difficulty on whatever policy the Administration is based.22. It may be convenient at this point to say a few words on the subject of Jewish immigration into Palestine. It is constantly asserted that the result of our policy will be &quot; to swamp the country &quot; with vast hordes of Jewish immigrants. The Arab Delegation repeatedly insisted upon this point, using language about the &apos;&apos; flood of alien immigration &apos;&apos; and so forth. It is probably true that, in the first year or so after the armistice, Jewish immigrants were admitted somewhat too freely and that a certain number of political undesirables were included in their number. Since the Jaffa outbreak of May 1921 immigration has been rigorously controlled, and permission to enter the country has been restricted to certain specified categories of immigrants. It has been our definite policy since then to confine immigration to the economic capacity of the country to absorb new arrivals. &quot;Sir H. Samuel, in his despatch of the 8th December, to which reference has already been made, estimated that not more than 27,000 Jews had entered the countrv since the occupation, and that the monthly average during the preceding six months had been only 550. The returns indicate that the total number admitted during the year 1922 was 7,844. The results of the recent census show that, out of the total population of about 756,000, the Mohammedans in Palestine number in round figures 589,600, the Jews 83,800 and the Christians 73,000. It is estimated that the maximum population that Palestine is ever likely to be able to contain is about 3 millions; and calculations made in the Colonial Office show that, given anything like the present rate of progress, the Mohammedan element will still be in a decided majority when that maximum is reached. The talk about &quot;swamping the country with Jews&quot; may therefore be dismissed as mere rhetoric. The common allegation that the Jewish immigrants are all &quot; Bolsheviks &quot;is equally wide of the mark. As already stated, a certain number of political undesirables entered the country &quot;during the early years of immigration. The worst of them have since been got rid of. There is no reason to believe that the bulk of the immigrants hold revolutionary views. It is true that the great majority of them come from Russia (or territory that formed part of the Russian Empire before the war) and from other countries in South-Eastern Europe.  The plain fact
11 46is that, leaving aside an individual enthusiast here and there, Jews will not emigrate in any numbers except from countries where they find conditions unpleasant. In France, Great Britain or the United States, the Jew is much too comfortable to wish to leave his home. It is from the countries where Jews have been persecuted and repressed that the&apos; stream of emigration flows. Such people have for many genera-tions been taught by bitter experience to look upon Government as a corrupt and cruel institution. It may take a little time to eradicate this prejudice, even in a country where British ideals prevail; but there is no reason to believe that the immi-grants are not rapidly adjusting themselves to their new conditions, just as they have done in other countries, such as the United States, to which persecution has driven them to emigrate.23. There can be no doubt that the change of Government in England has greatly revived the hopes of the Arab politicians. Their supporters in the late Parliament were mainly drawn from Conservatives who were out of sympathy with the Coalition Government, and who might not unreasonably be expected to carry more weight with the present than with the late Administration. Their protagonist in the late House of Commons is now actually a member of the Ministry. The news-papers which espoused their cause were- in the main those thai displayed special hostility to the Coalition Government in its later stages and worked most actively for a Conservative Administration. Given Oriental mentality, it is not surprising that the Palestine Arabs should entertain strong hopes of ,a reversal by the present Cabinet and Parliament of their predecessors&apos; policy.24. An immediate result of the changed horizon has been the return of the Arab Delegation to London. They were received by the Duke of Devonshire at the Colonial Office on the 11th January, and were told by him that, while the whole question of Palestine was being considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government without bias, he could hold out no hope that there would be any departure from the policy of the late Government as set out in the White Paper of June 1922. This intimation has since been repeated to them in writing (23rd January, 1923). Thus the position is that, while the Delegation have been given no hope of a change of policy, neither they nor the public at large have yet been told definitely that no such change is to take place. It is understood that the Delegation is to remain in London for the present in the hope of achieving some result by agitation in the press and in Parliament.25. It is essential on all accounts that a definite decision should be reached without delay as to the policy to be pursued. In dealing with the East nothing is so fatal as uncertainty. If there is to be a change of policy, the sooner it is announced the better. The present state of suspense is fair to nobody. It is not fair to allow the Jews to go on collecting money for their projects in Palestine if there is any question of non-fulfilment of the pledge on which these projects are based. It is not fair to the Arabs, if we mean to maintain our policy, to allow them to continue an agitation which may develop into action for which they will suffer in the long run. It is not fair to the High Commissioner and his officers to expect them to administer an Oriental country and at the same time to leave both them and the inhabitants of the country in doubt as to the policy to be pursued.26. It would be idle to pretend that the Zionist policy is other than an unpopular one. It has been bitterly attacked in Parliament&apos; and is still being fiercely assailed in certain sections of the press. The ostensible grounds of attack are threefold : (1) the alleged violation of the McMahon pledges; (2) the injustice of imposing upon a country a policy to which the great majority of its inhabitants are opposed; and (3) the financial burden upon the British taxpayer. The first of these arguments has been fully dealt with in Section I of this Memorandum. The second certainly has its origin in a genuine feeling, but the feeling has been largely coloured by a misunder-standing of the real aims and intentions of the Government. The explanations given in the White Paper should go far to remove all such misunderstandings in the future. With regard to the third argument, there has been much gross exaggeration as to the extent of the financial burden. The actual cost of Palestine to the British taxpayer in 1922-23 worked out at  2,024,000. We are pledged to reduce the amount to 1\ [9523] c2
millions in 1923-24 and to 1 million in 1924-25,* and our estimates for 1923-24 are being framed accordingly. These figures were given by Mr. Churchill in the House of Commons on the 4th July, 1922, and are accessible to anyone who wishes to ascer-tain the facts. But behind the ostensible reasons, there is the far more potent influ-ence of anti-Jewish prejudice, which affords the real impetus to the attack upon our ^ Zionist policy. This prejudice may not be so strong in England as in some continental countries, but it is undoubtedly a powerful force even here, and it has been intensified in recent years by the vague belief in a world-wide Judseo-Bolshevik conspiracy against civilisation. Opposition to Zionism is particularly strong in Roman Catholic circles. The Vatican is openly hostile, and many of our severest critics are Roman Catholics. The objection to handing over the Holy Land to the secular enemies of Christianity is intelligible; so also is the feeling of&quot;resentment that the Jews should derive the main benefit from the valour and self-sacrifice of British soldiers. What-ever we may do or say, sentiments of this kind will always have to be reckoned with.27. To the other side of the account must be &quot;set the excellent work that the Zionists have achieved and are achieving in Palestine. Their activities are described in Sir H. Samuel&apos;s despatch and the details need not be repeated here. They have spent nearly 5 millions during the last four years in developing the country, and are prepared to spend much more. It -is they alone who are both able and willing to supply capital, enterprise and additional labour. Palestine is a poor country and unlikely to attract capital from the outside world on its own merits. The Zionists have a special incentive, unconnected with calculations of profit and return, to devote their brains and resources to the development of the country. It may well be argued that, by giving them the opportunity of doing so, we are serving the interests of civilisation as a whole, quite apart from any sentimental considerations about .restoring a scattered people to its ancient fatherland.28. It may be noted here that the Zionists (having accepted the White Paper policy) are prepared to carry on their work without claiming any special political privileges. The idea of a &quot; Jewish State &quot; in Palestine has been definitely ruled out, and the Zionists have implicitly acquiesced in its elimination. There is no ground for the charge that the present Government inPalestine is a&quot; Jewish&quot; or &quot;Zionist&quot; Administration. It is a. British Administration, controlled by a British Minister and a British Department of State. It is true that the High Commissioner is himself a Jew; but that did not prevent him from being for many years a member of the -British Cabinet. Judaism is never considered a bar to the highest administrative posts in the British Empire. One of the most popular Prime Ministers of the 19th century was a Jew; so is the present Viceroy of India. Out of the ten high officials who are to be ex offieio members of the Legislative Council in Palestine, only two are Jews. Figures given in the House of Commons on the 19th July, 1921, show that, at that time, the total number of public servants in Palestine was 2,571, of whom 1,338 were Christians, 719 Mohammedans, and 514 Jews.29. There is the further point that, apart altogether from our pledges to the &apos; Zionists or to anybody else, there are Imperial considerations that favour the retention-tiori of Palestine by Great Britain. Recent developments have profoundly modified our position in Egypt and circumstances might easily arise, under the new conditions, that would seriously affect our hold upon the Suez Canal. In such a contingency the control of Palestine might be of vital importance to us. The point is well put in the annexed extract from a note by Sir Gilbert Clayton, late Adviser to the Egyptian &apos; Ministry of the Interior : &quot; It is submitted that the retention of British control in Palestine is essential from the standard of Imperial strategy. The control of the Suez Canal* These figures are exclusive of the subsidy to Transjordan, which amounted to  180,000 in 1921-23 and to  100,000 in 1922-23. It was intended to reduce the figure to  50,000 for 1923-24; but it is now proposed to increase this amount by  100,00&apos;&apos;, making a corresponding reduction in the estimates for Palestine. Tims, the figure for Transjordan will stand at  150,000, but the combined estimate will not Mi -exceed the amount originally contemplated, viz.,  1,550,000. The position in Palestine is that the expenses ^ of the civil administration are met from local revenues, while the cost of the garrison (including the British gendarmerie) is at present borne by the British Exchequer. It cannot be said that local finances are in an altogether satisfactory condition. The Palestine Government has much difficulty in balancing its budget, and lias incurred a considerable floating debt, which it is hoped to pay off when a loan can be raised.
has always been considered vital.to the safety of Imperial communications with India, the Far East and Australia. Previous to 1914 this control was preserved on the sea by the maintenance of adequate British naval strength available for the Eastern Mediterranean, and on land by the occupation and control of Egypt, thus enabling a British force to protect the passage of the Suez Canal by taking up a position on the, banks of the Canal itself and interposing the waterless regions of Sinai as a barrier against hostile advance from the East and North. The experience of the recent war, and especially the rapid development of aviation, has rendered this barrier ineffective and made it necessary to advance the line of defence of the Canal by many miles. Moreover, it is hardly con-ceivable that the present policy pursued-in regard to the Egyptian question would have been either recommended or accepted had it not appeared certain that British control in Palestine would be maintained for at least a considerable period of years. In brief, that policy is dependent on the assumption that the march of events has shifted the key to our Eastern communications by sea and air from Egypt to Palestine. With Palestine under British control, with the British position maintained in thei Sudan and on the western littoral of the Red Sea, and, above all, with adequate British naval power in the Eastern Mediterranean, Egypt becomes of minor importance, provided always that foreign intervention in her affairs is not permitted.&quot;30. It is for His Majesty&apos;s Government to weigh the various arguments and to form their own conclusions. So far as the pledges are concerned, there appear to be four alternative courses that they might conceivably take : (1.) They might say in effect: &quot;We have examined our predecessors&apos; commit-&quot; ments and find that they gave contradictory promises to the Arabs and &quot; to the Jews. As the Arab promise was the earlier, we feel bound to &quot; maintain it, and consequently declare the Jewish pledge to be null and &quot;void.&quot;(2.) They might say : &quot; We are not satisfied that any pledges were given to the &quot; Arabs regarding Palestine. The language used was inconclusive. On &quot; the other hand, the pledge to the Jews was clear and unequivocal. But &quot; the Jewish pledge provided not only for a National Home for the Jews, &quot; but also for the maintenance of the civil and religious rights of existing &quot; non-Jewish communities in Palestine. Experience has shown that the &quot; two parts of the pledge are wholly incompatible. We do not propose &quot; to proceed further with the experiment.&quot;(3.) They might say ; &quot; Whatever pledges may or may not have been given either &quot; to Jew or to Arab, we find that the commitments incurred by our pre-&quot; predecessors are more than we are able to discharge. It is a case not of &quot; argument, but of sheer necessity. We have no alternative but to &quot; abandon the task.&quot;(4.) They might take the same ground as the late Government, viz., that, looking at the pledges as a whole, they find that there is nothing in what was said to the Arabs to preclude the due fulfilment of the Balfour Declaration; that they regard the policy of the White Paper as adequately safe-guarding both parts of that Declaration and see no reason for making any departure from it.31. Alternatives (1), (2) and (3) all involve the definite repudiation of the Balfour Declaration. - If that course is adopted, it is submitted that we have no alternative but to return the Mandate into the hands of the League of Nations and evacuate Palestine forthwith. We should be placed in an intolerable position if, after breaking a promise made to the Jews in the face of the whole world, we were to retain any connection with Palestine from which we derived, or could be held to derive, any conceivable benefit. We should, indeed, stand convicted of an act of perfidy, from which it is hardly too much to say that our good name would never recover. The real alternative, therefore, seems to lie between complete evacuation, on the one hand, and, on the other, the continuance of the policy of the late Govern-ment as laid down in the White Paper. Within the limits of the Balfour Declaration, if that is to be maintained, there is little room for further concession to the Arabs beyond what has already been made. If we surrender the Mandate, the League of Nations may or may not succeed in finding another Mandatory. If they do not
succeed, the Turks will inevitably return. Our position in that event will be an unenviable one. We shall stand for all time as the Christian Power which, having rescued the Holy Land from the Turk, lacked the strength or the courage to guard what it had won.Middle East Department, Colonial Office, Wth February, 1923.APPENDIX 1.Extracts from Correspondence between Sir Henry McMahon and the Sherifof Mecca.Note by Sherif of Mecca (undated and unsigned; enclosed in Letter to Mr. Storrsof July 14, 1915)..... FOR these reasons the Arab nation sees fit to limit themselves, as time is short, to asking the Government of Great Britain, if it should think fit, for the approval through her deputy or representative, of the following fundamental propositions, leaving out all things considered secondary in comparison with these, so that it may prepare all means necessary for attaining this noble purpose, until such time as it finds occasion for making the actual negotiations :  &apos;Firstly: England to acknowledge the independence of the Arab &apos; countries, bounded on the north by Mersina-Adana up to the 37&apos; of latitude, on which degree falls Birijik, Urfa, Mardin, Midiat, Amadia Island, up to the border of Persia; on the east by the borders of Persia up to the Gulf of Basra; on the south by the Indian Ocean, with the exception of the position of Aden to remain as it is; on the west by the Red Sea, the Mediterranean Sea up to Mersina. . . .ji, Jf.
