PROPOSER M BASE.Memorandum by the Secretary.1,     As the question ef Singapore has been under considera-tion for some time and the documents&quot;are somewhat numerous, it may be convenient to the .-Cabinet to have before them a ;pre is on the subject.Zo     The question of the establishment of a naval base at Singapore sas first &quot;brought up at the Standing defence Sub-Committee in May, 1921,     Their conclusions, reached as the result of a series of meetings held in May and June, were laid before tho late Cabinet by the Lord President of the Council (Lord Balfour) as Chairman of the Standing Defence Sub-committee on June 16, 1921,     In presenting these ; Conclusions to the Cabinet, &quot;Mr,,&apos; Balfour outlined broadly how the naval situation had changed and how the renewal of the Anglo-Japtmese.-hlJJLanoe..r.-- although--reducing the probabil ity of danger arising in the Pacific in the immediate future, would not remove the need for developing a naval base at Singapore, which, standing as it did at the entrance to the Pacific, not only covered the main entrance to the Indian Ocean from the eastward, but-flanked the route from Eastern Asia to Australasia, and was of very great importance to the Dominions.     He further pointed out that now that oil fuel had been Introduced in the Royal ITcvy,V \
although the Fleet might get to Singapore it would be helpless when it arrived there if it did not find at least the import-ant elements of a naval base.     He also called attention to the.fact that-even if tho work of developing the port were begun now, it would probably not be completed before the expiration of the next-tern of renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, say four to five, years.     Mr. BALFOUR added that it was because the interests of the British Empire in the Pacific were so immense that the Standing Defence Sub-Committee had, after a long discussion, arrived at the conclusion which was before the Cabinet;    as, whatever fleet we might maintain,, it was alnost.impossible to continue a situation which meant that we could not use it in those waters where it v/as most likely to be.required^&quot;The Cabinet then adopted the following resolution in regard to Singapore:-To approve the following Conclusion of the Standing Defence Sub-Committee of the Con-committee of Imperial Defence, for submission to the forthcoming&quot;Meeting of Prime Minis-ters and Representatives of India;-&quot;The Committee recognise thet the question of incurring expenditure under existing, conditions on the development of Singapore as a naval base is one which involves-po1-political and financial considerations out3ide their purview:   &amp;nd that accordingly a final decision in the. nctter must rest with the Cabinet,,In view, however, of the vital importance from a strategical, and. - Imperial point of view of developing the port of Singapore on.such lines as will, mate it possible for the British fleet to operate in the Pacific, if called upon to do so, the Committee e.re of opinion that at the forthcoming meeting of I-rime Ministers and Representatives of India, the policy favoured by His Lcjestyrs Government should be stated f s follows:-
(a) His Majesty&apos;s Government fully recognise that the basis of any system of Imperial defence against attack from oversea, whether upon the United Kingdom, australian -lasia or elsewhere, must be, as it has always.been, the maintenance of our sea power:(b) The most pressing question In this con-nection at the present time is that of the measures to be taken for the pro-tection of Imperial Interests in the Pacific:(c) His Majesty&apos;s- Government are advised that for this purpose it is essential that Singapore should be available as a base of concentration, repair, and supply for the British fleet and auxiliary services;   and they are accordingly prepared to take the lead in develop-, ing.that port as a naval base:(d) Owing to existing financial conditions it will not be practicable to incur a large expenditure for thi3 purpose in    -the immediate future;   but it is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to develop the base as funds become available, and the greater1 the assist-  -ance that can be rendered by the Oversea Governments in this connection the sooner will the necessary programme be completed&quot;,(Cabinet 56(21)&apos; conclusion 3).3.     The question of the Importance of Singapore was explained to the Imperial Conference by Lord Balfour on June 28, 1921,in the following terms&quot;The new difficulty, the new situation, arises from this.     A modern battle fleet is worked, and will more and more be worked, by oil and not by coal. It is impossible, for a great many reasons, financial and other, to keep the great bulk of the British fleet in the Pacific.     To keep the bulk of the fleet in.the Pacific so far from its base involves a prodigious cost and extraordinary administrative difficulties, and I think that we must assume that in the main it will be in Western waters and in Northern waters that the British fleet, the main bulk of the British fleet, will be concentrated in peace time.     What is required there is to make arrangements by which the British fleet can be transferred effectively.and rapidly so as to operate in the Pacific.     It cannot possibly operate -in the Pacific unless it has a . place in the Pacific where it can concentrate and where it can re-fuel.     If you send out a fleet from the Atlantic or the Mediterranean, the great bulk of such, a fleet, if. you send it out to the B\ar East, could get to Singapore, which is the gate of the Pacific, but when it got to Singapore, unless it brought with it an immense number of oilers which are not yet in existence it would find itself without the power of re-fuelling.     It wotild be immobile, and if immobile
it would be useless, relatively useless.,     In these circumstances&apos;we have come to the&apos; conclusion that one of the most pressing needs for Imperial defence is that Singapore should be made into a place where the British fleet can concentrate for the defence of the Empire, of our interests in the East, our Interests in India, our interests in Australia, our interests in New Zealand, our interests in the smaller Possessions there, and that for that purpose it Is absolutely necessary to,  undertake works at Singapore 4,     Those works cannot he finished in a day0     They cannot be finished in&apos; a year.,    They must take some time to completeaMr. MASSEY:   -They are going on,f-Ia-5.A^FlluB:  &apos;&apos;Iot yet, &apos;:- This question has only been &apos;takeh&quot;in hand quite recently,,     Therefore, until Singapore is rendered the .place which we think it ought,to be made., a place of concentration,&apos; a place of re-fitting and re-fuelling, until this is done we are at a relative disadvantage undoubtedly in tho Pacific, and that is a very strong strategical . reason, putting all wider considerations apart, why we should remain on the most friendly terms with Japan and why; we should continue a policy we have hitherto pursued with such success, which is tba t- Qf joint action with Japan in the var East&quot;,,    (Imperial Conference, 8th &quot;meeting.)4*        Wo formal resolution was adopted by the Imperial Conferencein regard to the question of the assistance that might be givenby the Dominions in developing the base at Singapore,,In regard to the naval defence of the Empire, the follow-ing resolution was adopted:-&quot;That, while recognising the necessity of ,co-operation among the various portions of the Empire to provide such naval defence as may prove to be essential for security, and while holding that equality with the naval strength of any other Power is a minimum standard for that purpose, this Conference is of opinion that the method and the expense of such co-oper-ation are matters for the final determination of the several Parliaments concerned, and that any recommendations thereon should be deferred until after the coming Conference on Disarmament&quot;05.        At Washington the greatest care was exercised by the PrUisb f^empire Delegation to exclude Singapore from the scope of Article XIX of the Treaty for the Limitation of Naval Armament   which provides for a status quo in regard to fortifications and naval fcpses.
6. On July 12, 1922, after the Washington Conference, thequestion of the defence of Singapore again came before the . Standing Defence Fub-Committee in the form of Memoranda (including extracts&apos;- from t^e Report of a Committee sent by the Admiralty to Singapore) on the sites for the proposed naval base and aerodrome1 and seaplane station, at Singapore (C.I.D. Papers Nos, 170-C and 174-0)Differences of opinion arose between the Admiralty and &apos;;&apos;ar Office as to the merits of the Johore Strait recommended by the Admiralty Committee, and the question of the sites was referred, to the Overseas Defence Committee for early consideration (Standing Defence Subcommittee 23rd Minutes)i7.,        At the 26tb Meeting of the Standing Defence &quot;Sub-Committee,held, on November 13,1922, Lord Peatty made an. important statement which is recorded as follows:-&quot;The First Sea Lord stated that as this was the first meeting of the Committee which he had attended, since it had been re-established under the new Government, he wished to place on record a warning as regards the naval situation in the Pacific,&quot; Fe wished It to be clearly understood, that since the Washington Conference the situation from the naval point of view had altered in the Pacific.     The United States were now incapable of naval action in the Western Pacific, thus leaving the British empire the &apos;sole Power to counter with naval forces any aggressive tendencies on the part   . of Japan.    :&quot;&apos;e exist in the Par Fast on sufferance of another-Power,     This had already been pointed out to the Committee of Imperial Defence, and a decision had been taken that the naval base at Singapore should be proceeded with,,     without Singapore we should be swept out of the;western Pacific and have no means of countering a naval offensive by Japan,,     There was reason to believe that if the war had taken a definite turn against us Japan would have thrown over the Allies and. associated herself with Germany, and that even durinsr the war Japanese agents were in touch with Indian agitators.     Japan&quot;might fall to a similar temptation in the future, when, by encouraging a revolt in India and-raising the banner of &quot;Asia for the Asiatics&apos;, it would be no - exaggeration to say that Japan would be able to wrest from us uur position in India,     The British navy, under exist-ing conditions, without.a base at Singapore, would be able to do nothing to counter the activities of Japan in the Fast&quot;   The Committee of Imperial Defence had agreed to the construction of a navel base at Singapore
At the same meeting the Standing Defence Sub-Committee approved for despatch to the Dominions a Memorandum by the Naval Staff (C.I.D. Paper No. 176-C) entitled &quot;The Washington Conference and its effect upon empire Naval Policy and Co-operation&quot;.     In this Memorandum the Admiralty recommended, among.other forms of naval co-operation by Australia-, New Zealand and India, that they should co-operate in the develop-ment of Singapore, either financially or by the provision of material.8.        On December 14th the Report of the Oversea DefenceCommittee on the sites (C.I.D. paper No.182-.C-J came beforethe Standing Defence Sub-Committee-.   At that Meeting.,&quot;The ^irst Lord of the Admiralty explained that without a base at Singapore our fleet could not operate at all in the Pacific.     In fact we. should be powerless against Japan east, of Suez&apos;. There was no doubt that Singapore was the best place for such, a base.     It occupied a dominating position on .the straits between- the Indian and the Pacific Oceans.........The Secretary of State for the Colonies,stated that the Governments of the Dominions, were unwilling at present to:-commit themselves to any large, naval expenditure.     At the next Imperial Conference, which might be held next year, it would be- possible to &quot;lay before them, as the deliberate opinion of those best able to judge, that a naval base;at Singapore was necessary, and it might be possible to induce them to&apos;give financial assistance&apos;to develop, it&quot;.......     As the result of this discussion the Standing defence sub-Gommittee recommended -:&apos; ii &apos;,-- &apos;&apos;&quot;;        -   .. /&apos;.:&apos;-:::. . &apos;.      &quot;d    \     &apos;..&apos;&quot;d .;(a) That the decision of the late Government inJune, 1921, that a base should be established at Singapore on the understanding that no considerable expenditure need be incurred for the next two years, should be re-affirmed by the Cabinet&quot;In addition to approving the sites&apos;on the Johore, Strait, recommended by the Overseas Defence Committee, the Standing Defence Sub-Committee recommended  
(d) That steps be taken to, acquire the land required for the naval base, aerodrome and seaplane station without delay,&quot;9,        The scale of proba-ble attack and the scale for military and air defences required for the defence of the naval basej as well as an approximate programme of annual construction, were referred to,, the Overseas Defence Committee for considerati and report,,     These questions are still before the Overseas Defence Commitfee, who are awaiting, the result of a joint War Game on the subject to be worked out between the naval,&apos; military and Air Staff Colleges, which is to take place early next months the actual question before the Cabinet is recommendation (a) above :-(a) That the decision of the late Government in June, 1921, that a base should be  -established at Singapore on the under-standing that no considerable expenditure need be incurreu for the next two years,. should be re-affirmed, by the Cabinet.(Sd,)- &apos;M.PtA.
