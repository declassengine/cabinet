COMMUIflSTSThe Presidium of the Communist International hasdecided to hold the session of the Enlarged Executive in moscow about the middle of May.    Members of the executive of the Cormiunisli Party of Great Britain, who have been summoned to attend are considering points to be raised on the agenda which covers:.&quot;(1)    Report of the Presidium.(2)     Occupation of the Ruhr Easin end questions in connection with it.(3)    Praotioal measures for the Execution of the United Front.(4)     The British labour Movement and the tasks of the British Seotion.(5)      Discussion on the limits of centralism.   (In the first instance with the Scandinavians).(6)      The Txade Union question and faotory conmlttee problems.(?)      Campaign against Fascism.(8)      Preliminary work for the Programme of the Communist International.&quot;A secret meeting of leading communists was held in London on March 25th to hear the reports of the political and organising secretaries on the work accomplished since the re-organisation of the Party:   Inkpin, organising secretary, reported that since the Battersoa conference thirty-o;ae meetings had been held at headquarters, the executive mooting twice a week.   Their first duties had been the curtailment of expenses, the formation of a political and an organising bureau, the assignment of duties to the various members of the executive and the re-distribution of branches.The difficulties of the last mentioned work were great owing to so many branches being isolated and so small/
small numerically, that it was difficult to form them into area groups.   Previously the tendency had been to overlook such places, but this had now been rectified by allocating the duty to oertain comrades at Headquarters instead of placing them under the control of district c onmittees.   The danger of endeavouring to set up a too elaborate organisation was great, as at the present time it should not be lost sight of that they were not a gigantic movement, but were a movement with gigantic possibilities, which was nearly as good.   The financial position was also very critical, which increased the difficulties,   &quot;when the membership in a convenient area is above 25, the principle has been followed&apos;of forming area groups, but isolated branches have been given orders direct from Headquarters as it v?ould ba ridiculous in such cases to form an elaborate local organisation.   In London, twelve local party organisations have been established.     The house to house canvass, Inkpin said, has been taken up in a manner reflecting great credit on the majority of the members. Various circulars, instructional books and leaflets had been issued since the Party had been re-organised:   this literature, if studied by the members, would place them in full knowledge of the establishment of the Party. There has been a great demand for the Parcy Commission Report of which no more copies were available:   owing to the excessive cost of publication the complete report would not be re-issued but would be reproduced in sections and sold to the branches.A complete census of the membership had been taken by means of a questionnaire card:   in only a very few instances had these cards been filled in correctly the first ti:re:   a lot of clerical work had been involved inreturning/
returning them to the secretaries for correction.p ri rThe shop committee hai not heen very successful wi ifinancially.   There has heen a slight loss on the shop sales,which it was hoped to rectify under the change of management.Regarding &quot;The Workers&apos; Weekly&quot;, the total sales since theto 51,000first issue ranged from &apos;35,00C/,   Another feature of the work was that 100,000 handbill a haa been printed and distributed.The political secretary, Tom Boll, stated in   his reportthat the groat thing to bs borne in mind was that each sectionwas co-related and they must not work in watertight compartments:he was sorry to admit that this had been the case:   beoausecertain sections or committees were not made directly responsible for aiy section it did not mean that they shouldnot bring under notice something whioh affected anothercommittee.   On tho other hand he deplored the overlapping ofwork between the various committees in many centres and pointedout that unless the Central Committee were placed in possessionof all the faots they could not be expected to formulate&apos; apolicy.   Roports were not ooming in as they should and theCentral Committee could not be expected to issue instructionswithout data to work upon.     The Nuclei work in Trade unions had not made satisfactory progress but this particular work was receiving special attention.   Work in Trades Councils waaalso proceeding slowly,   he emphasised the need of the Partyissuing a definite party programme in order to get a politicalprestige with a distinct Communist stamp and not only with aLeft Wing Labour label.-After mentioning cases of lack of co-ordination, Bellsaid, &quot;We must remember that all our work is co-related.   Wehave attempted too much instead of going slowly but surely and understanding everything.   There is a grave difficulty offorcible feeding and of the members suffering from politicalindigestion.&quot;    Many energetic members had been given too muchto/
to do whilst others excused themselves and thought they were good revolutionaries when they sold a few &quot;Workers&apos; Weekly&apos;8&quot; to their mates.   A live few ware tetter than a dead mass.Recently a Colonial Committee has been set up to co-operate with the Colonies.   Referring to the Parliament airy airi Municipal Cormilttees, Bell said that too much time had been wasted in oompiling &quot;Voters Lists&apos;&apos;, etc., instead of watching Nav/bold&apos;&apos;s aotivltios in Parliament, and the activities of the Coranuaiat members on Borough Councils and Boards of Guardians.   Those Committees should submit names of likely candidates for municipal and parliamentary positions:   in this class of work it should be remembered that propaganda was the object and not merely &quot;vote catching!&quot; it was time that Nowboia had a definite office in Motherwell to increase his preatige,The duties of the Press Committees such as collecting material suitable for publication in &quot;Tho workers&apos; Weakly&quot; were explained.In regard to &quot;The United Froat&quot; Bell said their agreed policy now was that it was quite in order to orltioisa the Labour Party and bring under notice the shortcomings of the reactionary leaders of this party:   there should, however, be no personal abuse.Bell explained that the Paruy Training Committee was only in its experimental stage:   the difficulty was that they had nothing to base their work on as there had never been suoh a thing in the socialist movement in this country.   This committee would deal also with the educational aspect, and in this connection, a satisfactory arrangement has been made with the Plebs league.     Tho educational section should develop such subjects as &quot;Confiscation versus Compensation&quot;, &quot;Socialisation versus Nationalisation&quot;, &quot;Revolutionary aotion versus parliamentary action&quot;.Ro gar ding/&apos;
Regarding the Unemployed Movement he admitted thet little headway had heen made with this tody of material.   Hoexplained the difficulty as being that some of the leaders of the unemployed movement wished to make this a separate revolutionary organisation embracing both unemployed and employed.   He anticipated the party asking greater use of these men in the future, by making their committees an organisation for carrying on Communist, agitation.Owing so the very small number of women in the Party, the question would have to be considered in the near future of making the women1 &amp;- Sect ion of the conitmnJct Party of Great Britain &amp;. department and not a separate body,   Another question for early consideration would have to be v/hether the Young Communist League should function separately or not.Ho next touchod upon the circulation of &quot;She Workers&apos; Weekly&quot;, saying that succesB in this direction showed what could be done with an effort.Boll ended his speech by saying that their efforts   -should be directed towards making a movement stable enough to take advantage of such a revolutionary era as existed between 1918 and 1920, as there is bound to be such an era in the near future.Bell has sent the following document to all DistriotParty Committees:-&quot;Tho Municipal seotion of the parliamentary and &quot;Municipal Department of the Party has in hand the carrying out of the clauses in the Commissions Report relating to Local Government work.   Its immediate task is to give a fighting lead to p&amp;rty members acting aa representatives throughout the oountry.   Obviously, however, this lead must consist of something more than the generalities with which we are all familiar,   Jt ist  have relation to the concrete conditions of British Local Government.   Hence, the urgent need for a mass of information based on the knowledge and experience of those comrades who have actually been engaged in municipal activities.&quot;Accordingly I am to request that you will furniBh at the earliest possible date (1) a brief statement of your views aa to the tactics itfUch should be pursued by Communist groupa on the type of body on whioh youserve/
serve (due allowance being made for size of groups, composition of other elements, etc.) and (2) tboae of your experiences you think most likely to be helpful to Party members similarly situated elsewhere.&quot;District Party Committees have also received from thePolitloal Bureau instructions regarding Looal government elections:&quot;The Central Committee have had under consideration the statement of Policy for the Local Government Elections issued in October 1922.   It is decided to cancel this statement as an unsuitable basis for local Government activities.   Until a new programme has been worked out in accordance with the deoisions at the Fourth Congress the.Central Co&amp;miittes instruct all District party Committees to concentrate at the forthcoming Local elections upon the immediate issues in their areas calculated to bring to the front and sharpen the lines of class ounflict.&quot;These points of immediate issue should be remitted to the centre and upon their endorsement, modification, or, if necessary, alternative proposals being returned, such points should form the draft of the election address to be used in the localities.   Where a Local Party Committee is engaged in an eleotion, the final draft should be remitted to the centre for approval before it is printed.&quot;In all oases candidates must make clear&apos;their Communist principles and membership of the Communist Party,&quot;The progress of the work of Party Training has not come up to the expectations of the Communist Party, as the &quot;rate at which the various districts get the new organisationmachinery into operation varies so widely that it is difficultto operate a connected scheme,&quot;    No &quot;permanent&quot; syllabus willbe prepared at present on Party Training as the provisionalsyllabus, extracts from which have been quoted in recentreports, has been found to be sufficient for the present needsof the Party.The Communist Party has asked Local Party Committees, to form &quot;Industrial Groups&quot; immediately:   the following particulars ware asked for in connection with this work:-&quot;(1)    Factory conditions.(2)    Trade Unions, Pates Paid or Not,(3)    Work done in Factory.(4)    Hands employed and how many,
(5)     If Workmen are Trade Unionists and if possible what society.(6)    Manager&apos;s name,   foreman&apos;s name.(7)    How many Gangs in shop,(8)     If Gangs are under the supervision of a Working Charge Hand or Foreman or&apos; both.(9)     If possible the political views of Charge Hand and Foreman.&quot;Much oritioism has been directed against the editor of&quot;The workers&apos; Weekly&quot; by members of the Executive Committee ofthe Communist Party who consider that the leading articles and style of the paper show that R. Palme Putt is completelyout of touch with the Rank and File.   Things are being madenone too easy for i)utt who wrote recently:&quot;We produce the paper here in the face of God knows what of blocking and inertia - oven the Propaganda Weak six page issue was only admitted after a pledge to raise t&apos;,,e cash privately.&quot;It is reported that Headquarters is demanding payment from the Coventry, group of an outstanding account of  48 for literature:   it appears that the money earmarked for the payment of this debt has been used to pay debts for intoxicants supplied at the Communist Club.   Headquarters has threatened to cut off supplies if monthly instalments of this debt are not paid and if accounts for current literature are not settled immediately they   fall due.The Chief Constable informs me that about 35,000 workers in tho Jute industry in Dundee are idle as a result of a lock-out of all Mill and Factory Workers:   the communists are working assiduously to promote trouble but Sims, the Secretary of the Jute and Flax workers&apos; Union, has resetted their interference.   Meetings under the auspices of the communists and the organised unemployed have been held in Dundee daily for the past fortnight, Willie Gallaoher and Robert Stewart taking a prominent part in the proceedings.Speeches/
Speeches made by three of the local unemployed, returned hunger marchers, have been reported to the Sheriffs Procurator Fiscal as it was considered that the language used by them might lead to trouble.&apos;m EBP INTERNATIONAL OP LABOUR UHIOKSWith the spread of industrial unrest in the UnitedKingdom, Moscow, through its Intermediary, the Mid-EuropeanBureau of the Red International of Labour Unions, has become increasingly active.   Another batch of original secretdocuments testify to the interest displayed by Moscow inunrest in this country.   Reinhardt has sent to the british bureau an &quot;appeal to the miners of all countries by the All-Russian Federation of Miners, Moscow&quot; with the request thatif be printed at the earliest possible date &quot;in the national and local trade union press&quot;.&quot;We urge you to fulfil the request of the manifest to the utmost extent with the help of the revolutionary groups and trade union opposition and by this to induce also the reformist, denominational and other unions to reprint it.   Special stress must be laid on making the manifest known among the miners at the pits.   The result of this appeal will decide, whether we are able to make a step forward towards the United International Front in future struggles.&quot;Please report to us if the appeal is well received and has good results, and which attitude the reformist, denominational and other unions adopt with regard to it.   It is essential for us to know&apos; this, for the further successful organisation of the campaign.&quot;The Appeal is as follows :-,i   &quot;It is your work, ,your productive energy that decides the economic life of the world.   It is you, whose hard labour conveys the black diamond to the surface.   It is coal,that rules supreme over industry. -If your strong arm rests, no chimney is smoking and no machine run8.&quot;Recognise your power, Miners of the Worldl&quot;Reoognlse your enemy:   Capitalism!&quot;With ever growing impudence and brutality the coal-kings are condemning you to a life of hunger and want.   The groans of the pit-slaves rise from allcountries/
countries.  Misery and privation are daily guests in your slums.   You all are witness how even your demand of . the minimum of exlstonoa is not fulfilled hy the exploiters how they scorn the voice of your organisations.&quot;A period of intense struggle has begun.   The colliery-owners on the Continent, in England and in America are talcing the offensive against the miners.   Everywhere the ooal-kittgs are arming to strike a crushing blow at you. Your wages are not increased according to the increase of cost of living.   On the contrary, they are reduced; working hours are lengthened and you are robbed even of your moat elementary rights.&quot;Since February 7th and 8th a great struggle is being fought by 100,000 miners in Alsace-Lorraine.&quot;Since February 14th 45,000 miners are striking in Belgium.&quot;Since   January 26th 10,000 English miners are striking in the Baldon, Harton and Withborn collieries, South-Shields.&quot;In Thsheco-Slovakia a general strilte of all miners is imminent.   The pitmen of Ostran-Karwin are all ready out of work.&quot;The general strike of the French miners, scarcely ended, threatens to begin again.   All miners of the Lolre-Bassin are all ready fighting.&quot;If the workers don&apos;t stand up for their own defence, sordid slavery will be their inevitable lot.&quot;Hunger is threatening you.   there is but one altor-native to it.   Forward!   Bo not suffer this any longer, prepare and arm for your defence!&quot;Miners of all countries, request of your organisations, irrespective of their political tendency&quot;TO CREATE AH INTERNATIONAL MILITANT FUND BY MEANS OF PIT-COMMITTEES AND OF UNITED NATIONAL MILITANT FUND COMMITTEES I&quot;Take the initiative to form in all countries such national control committees, oompoeed by representatives of the different miners&apos; organizations, in order to organise and carry through systematically the colleotions for the Militant Fund,   unity alone is strength.&apos;&quot;Comrades of the mines, within and out of our organisations, combine all your forces in the oommon struggle for your right and for a deoant existence.   Oppose your organised power to the power of the Mining Capital.&quot;To-day Capital is still your master.   Yours the task to throw off its yoke and to conquer liberty!&quot;Up, forge your arms!Allrussian Miners&quot; Federation:S. Schwartz.&quot;On/
On March 13th the secretary of the Mia-European Bureauwrote to S.O. Davies, the extremist Miners&apos; Agent in Dowlais:-&quot;We read in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; that on Max ah 27th &amp; National Delegates&apos; Conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great-Britain will take place in London and that the miners of Lancashire, Cheshire and South-Wales have adopted motions mandating their delegates to propose to the Confererge the calling off of the existing tarif-sgreements.&quot;We would be very thankful for information by you on the following points:-(1)   How many oomrades representing our standpoint are among the delegates for the conference?(2)   Have measures been taken to delimit a definite and uniform line of policy for our delegates end to assure concerted action among them?(3)   What will be the presumable strength of thedifferent currents of opinion at the conference?&quot;In view of the far-reaching importance of every step taken by the English miners at this juncture not only with regard to their own movement but also with regard to the struggle of the continental miners, we urgently request you to inform us as fully aad as immediately as possible on this matter.&quot;Another document gent by Reinhardt to the British bureau of the Rea International of Labour Unions has oome into mypossession:   in it he stated;-&quot;...We read in our papers about a strike of agriculture workers.   10,000 workers laid down her work. Please inform us with a full report about this important matter for publishing it in the international press.   Let us know if it is possible for you to ao anything end what is done.&quot;We read further that the English Building Workers voted for a general strike beginning 1st April by 1,000,000 Building Workers.   If it is so, please do your best for getting a contact with this important industrial group and send us also full informations for us and the Executive Bureau.&quot;The Mid-European Bureau is alBo paying attention to theBritish Postal Workers and has informsd Nat Watkins that:&quot;It is with greatest interest we read in the &apos;Daily Horald &apos; of March 10th, that a London section of the Union of post Office Workers has submitted a resolution to the next Annual Conference on May 1st supporting the admission of the Allrussian Union of Postal and Telegraph Workers to the International Federation.&quot;This Is all the more important because, as you&apos;will probably know, the Admission of the Allrussian Union to theInternational/
International was only defeated at the last International Congress of Postal Workers (Berlin August 1922) &quot;by a majority of 305,600 against 223,800 voices,&quot;The Russian Union is of course continuing its campaign for admission in spite of this defeat and will welcome very much indeed the help of the English comrades.&quot;We have at once informed the I,.P*C* in Moscow of this fact and would be extremely thankful to you for further information, especially on the following facts:(1)       How strong will presumably be the adherents of the London Resolution at the forthcoming Congress?(2)       Have any measures been taken to blocks propaganda for this resolution si so in the other sections of the union?   If not, can you immediately undertake such measures?(3)       Who is the comrade responsible for the resolution of the London Section?   Could you recommend him or another comrade for leading our work among the English Postal Employees?&quot;In view of the general backwardness of this group tod in view of the question of admission of the Allrussian Union, it is urgently necessary to appoint somebody responsible for this work also in England.&quot;The financial assistance to which Reinhardt referred inthe communication quoted in last week&apos;s report does not appear,as yet, to have reached the British Bureau of the RedInternational of Labour Unions as the secretary, in forwardingon March 22nd the weekly subsidy of S6 to the editor of   -&quot;The Worker&quot; informed him that:&quot;Unless something materialises between now and -then I shall be completely on the rocks.   But I am expecting to hear something every day with regard to this matter, as soon as I receive any information of a definite character, you will simultaneously receive , notification of same, it givesany one the b----- pip to be constantly in this position.&quot;It is reported from a reliable source that 3trongrevolutionary feeling exists in tho National AmalgamatedFurnishing Tradeo Association.TEE UNEMPLOYEDArrangements for the National Conference of the National Unemployed Workers&quot; Committee Movement in Coventry next monthare,/
are now practically oomplote:   72 committees will be represented by 119 delegates and under the scheme for pooling expenses the fee for each delegate will be  1.18.6., a figure which the Executive does not consider excsssivo as 16 Scottish committees are sending representatives.Hannington has visited Liverpool, Gateshead, Newcastle, and BiiEminghsm and will probably go to Derby on his way to Coventry.   Tho Chief Constable informs mo that one of his meetings at Gate ahead was adversely affected by the Grand National as the unemployed refused to enter the building until they heard the result of the race and when thoy did go in considered, it a more absorbing topic than Hannington1 s ; Bpsech.On Maroh 26th at a meeting held under the auspices of the National Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement at tho Central Hall, Peckham, Dallas &quot;amid an enthusiastic sceno&quot; was presented with  20 &quot;in recognition of tho splendid stand ho had mado for the unemployed of tho Camberwe11 district which resulted in him being sent to prison for nine months,&quot;On March 24th a moating held in Trafalgar Square by tho North Southward Organised Unomployed passed a resolutionprotesting against the conditions prevailing at Belmont Workhouse:   the audience varied from 50 to 300:   about  8 was thrown on the plinth.It is reported that Councils of Action have been set upaid tb:.:tin-Glasgow and the surrounding districts / mobile columns have also been formed in the same areas to deal with casos of eviction, every man being armed with a stick, poker or similar weapon.IRISH REVOLUTIONARY A CTIVITIBS IN GREAT Britain there is little news this week;   matters are practicallyat/
at a standstill. Nearly all the usual weekly meetings were cancelled owing to the absence of the real leaders, most of whom have beon deported. Those who remain are not courting the limelight; they say the odds are against them just now and they will wait to see how the deportees get on before aoing anything definite.A well-informed correspondent describes the situation as follows:-&quot;Irish affairs in London are settling down fast.. There is scarcely a person one ireots but feels relieved that Art 0&apos;Brion is in safe keeping, for all of them oould sea ho was likely to lead thorn into troublQo&quot;Tho publication of intercepted correspondence between the Republican leaders and their agents in America has also had its effects    The people see that most of their leaders aro actuated by vanity, greed and furious personal jealousies Tho amount of bickering, petty jealousy and graft disclosed by those letters has startled some of do Valera&apos;s followers. Khoy show that the movement instead of being on the eve of success, as de Valera&apos;s propaganda Department would have it, it is in tho last stages of collapses.On March 25th a mooting was hold in the Poplar Town Hall to protest against the doportations:   Mrs. Dospara, who was in the chair, referred to tho possibility of the deportees being shot &quot;by accident&quot; in Mount joy where shooting is no uncommon occurrence, and urged her labour friends to organise iceetings of protest all over the country and see tho matter through to .the bitter ond ;   there were about 600 persons present.In Liverpool things have beon particularly quiet.   Har^y Harto, a local labour Sinn Seiner, is trying to raise money for the Defence Fund but is ireeting with little success:   he is not very popular with the local Irish.Countess M&amp;rkievics, continuing her tour of the north,arrived/
arrived lu Glasgow on March SSnd.   On March 20th she addressed a meeting at Durham and another at South Shields:   the formerwas a distinct failure, only about 50 persona attending: thelatter was more successful, about 300 persons, 60$ women being present.    At Durham she concluded by appealing to herhearers to &quot;stand by the winning side.   Be true to the RepublicWe cannot lose:&quot;   at South Shields she said &quot;We are at warwith England, not with the Free Staters.......Wa must recruita rebel army, and not leave Ireland under England&apos;a feet.&quot;On Mar oh 18th at a communist nneting held In Birminghamto protest against the deportations, Joyce said:-&quot;I suppose som9 of you know I iouys Irish blood in me.    Although I am not a member of the I.S.D.L, I support the I.R.A. in everything it does.,*I am a trained Machine Gunner and if it ware possible to got to Ireland to-morrow I would go, but this time bo shoot down enemies of my class, the Irish Free state, and what is more I sm prepared to do the same thing in this country when the time is ripe,&quot;In Glasgow the chief activity consists of raising a Defence Fund for the a^portees:, the Military Organisation is at sizes and sevens at present and without leaders.The Republican journal &quot;EIRE&quot; oontinues its work of propaganda, although with some difficulty, owing to the police having seized its list of subscribers during the recent raids.
