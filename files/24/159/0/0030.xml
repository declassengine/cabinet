CABINET. Copy No.120(23).HOME AFFAIRS 0 OMHITTEE. The Local Authorities (Emergency Provisions) Bill).Memorandum by the Minister of Health.1,Section 1 of the Local Authorities (Financial Pro-visions) Act, 1921, provided, in view of the heavy cost of the relief given by Boards of Guardians to unemployed per-aons in the poorer parts of London, for an equalisation of part of the charge, through the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund. That Fund,, which was established in 1867, i3 one which is levied by an equal rate all over London.   The Act of 1921 increased the charge already made on the Fund In respect of persons receiving relief in a workhouse from 5d. to l/od. per day and fur that- authorised the charging upon the Fund of the expenses incurred in respect of. out-door relief within such scale and subject to such conditions as might be ore3-cribed by the Minister of Health.    The Section was a temporary one and ceased to operate last year.The continuance of widespread unemployment makes it neceasary to provide for a further period for the equalisation-tion of the.ie charges, and the situation has been fully dis-cu--sed with representatives of the Boards of Guardians and Borough Counciln who are affected.   Substantial agreement wan obtained as regards the charge for Indoor relief and the principle of the future charge for out-relief, but agreement was not obtained as regards the period of extension or an regards the actual rate per head per d?y at which out-door relief should be charged.An regards the first of these points, the proposal submitted to the conference was that there should be an extension for one year, but It war, urged by the Guardians
and Councils which benefit most largely from the charge, that this period was not sufficient, periods of two or even three years being demanded.   The period of eighteen months proposed in the Bill and covering the coming winter repre-sents a reasonable compromise between the views expressed.ito question arises In regard to the charge on the Fund in respect of indoor relief,, but it is proposed to Include in the recoverable expenses charges In respect of persons who are relieved In institutions which are not technically workhouses but are sxibstantially of the same nature as workhouses, such as the farm colony belonging to the Central (Unemployed) Body for London, in which institution there are at prasent some 300 unemployed persons from London who are being relieved at the cost of the Guardians,As regards out-door relief,   the former method of calculation by reference to a prescribed scale has proved cumbersome and expensive and It is proposed to replace it by a system of charging at a flat rate per day per person relieved. While the conference were agreed upon this alteration in the basis of charge the richer authorities sought to limit the common charge tc 8d per head per day, the poorer ones sought to raise it to lOd.     Again the figure of 9d. appears to represent.a reasonable compromise and, on the information which has been obtained of the working of the Act, it would mean the equalisation of a sum nearly, but not quite, as great as would have been the case if the Act of 1921 had been extended without modification.     Taking the figures for the half-year ended 31st March, 1922, the amount actually charged to the Fund in respect of out-door relief was  1,241,000 and the amount which would have been charged under the system now contemplated would have been  1,183,000.Under the proviso of Section 3(3) of the Local Authorities (Financial Provisions) Act, 1921, the Minister is enabled, as a special measure, to sanction loans, for a period not exceeding 10 years, in respect of current expenses, if the money is borrowed before the 1st April, 1923.-2-
h 3 t.vSection 6 of the same Act provides that money-borrowed before the let April, 1923, for unemployment works shall not be counted in the usual limit of loans (2 years&apos; .ansessable value under the Public Health Acts) up to which a Local Authority may borrow;   and also that, until the same date, the Local Inquiry,, usually required where a-fresh loan would make the debt over one year&apos;,&quot;3 a3aesa-able value, may be dispensed with.These measures were adopted because.of the emergency arising from unemployment.&apos;   That-emergency still continues, and so far as can be seen, Is likely still to continue for some time,.despite the gradual Improvement of trade.It is proposed, therefore, that the. special provisions in question 3hould be continued for at least another year.3. The provisions of the Scottish Clause includedin the Bill were explained in the memo.rand.iun circulated to the Cabinet by the. Secretary for-Scotland pn the 9th January (CP. 7(23)).*- . .A.G.
