(Signed)  A. BONAR LAW.29th December, 1922,-        ; I. .   .1, We were appointed by you oil the 29th December last to enquire into the methods which have been adopted in other countries during the last fifty years to increase the prosperity of agriculture, and to secure the fullest possible use of- the land for the production of food and the employment of,labour,-at a living wage, and to advise as to the methods by which&apos; those results can be achieved in this country.2. The terms of reference which you have given us are so wide, and the subject in its application is so important, that it is impossiblelto survey the field and form a fully considered judgment on many of its aspects without more extensive inquiry than has been possible in the time since we were appointed.3. We have examined many witnesses, both on British and foreign agricultural conditions, and considered much of the existing material on the subject before us. But there are other important witnesses whom, in the time at our disposal, it was impossible to hear, and still less has it been practicable to make any personal visits or inspections either in this country or abroad.4. In view of the very serious crisis with which the agricultural industry in this country is faced, we have judged it to be mostin  [29.3.23](5tt9889(10804)   G 10   100  4/23  E &amp; S A
helpful if we present at once, in an Interim Eeport, such con-siderations and recommendations-as ,may, income.- measure, be of service.:.      - ;r5. The gravity of the immediate state of British agriculture is already widely recognised.&apos;The sefiouslosses&quot; which have been incurred by the farmer in the past two years, the decline in the arable area, the prospect of a still further shrinkage, the conse-quent growing unemployment, and the rapid fall in agricultural wages to a level which in some districts can barely afford subsist-ence and which must prove not only detrimental to the welfare of the agricultural community but also affect seriously the position of labour in the other industries of this country these consideration-tions make it of the greatest urgency, that whatever can be done to encourage productive agricultural employment should be done at once.6. The depression in agriculture has affected most seriously the arable districts. Drought in 1921 and the heavy fall in pricesan 1922 have been main factors. The cereal crops, especially barley, have in many districts /involved the farmer in heavy losses^ while in the potato industry, the losses to growers have been from  10 to  15 per acre. The losses on other vegetable and fruit crops have also been serious, and the more intensive the cultivation the greater has heen the loss.-7. A feature of very special distress is that the men who, on returning from service after the war, entered upon agricultural and horticultural production have seen their capital largely destroyed by the adverse conditions of the first years; while the position also of those farmers who often because the only alternative was to leave their farms bought their holdings when high prices were ruling, and with the security before them which the Corn Production Acts ancl the declared policy of the Govern-ment guaranteed, is also very serious. The number of agricul-tural bankruptcies has rapidly risen; and arable farmers in particular are only able to hold on by cutting down expenditure on fertilisers, seeds, feeding-stuffs, machinery and other forms of productive outlay and by reducing both the amount and the rate of remuneration of their labour.;8. A. most urgent -matter is to maintain the arable area. We ^recognise fully !the importance of the ,grass area and of its improvement, and also the -considerable amount of employment given on dairy -farms where, the arable area may be a small proportion of the productive land. But the fact stands outrthat on the maintenance of, the arable area.depends the maintenance up to pre-war level of the home production.of,food and of the employment of labour.. Certain of our recommendations are therefore especially concerned with arable cultivation, while others affect particularly the live stock industry, and all aim at assisting &apos;the farmer and the labourer in &apos;their present diffi-culties.
9. Although our examination of foreign conditions -is-riot yeti complete, it as already apparent to us that in every other country-agriculture plays a much larger part in national life than- in Britain. In no other European, country have the arable area and the;employment of labour on the land declined during;the past fifty years to anything like the same, extent,.as,-they.:haye done at home. . The. reasons for these phenomena are cqmphcated and will he ;dealt j with more fully in a later report, but the outcome is.beyond,question., .&apos;.,...,   ,,,,,.,v.;    , ;!:!,.       ,, . ,,-10. In the light, however, of the general evidence we have received -regarding home and foreign conditions-we-1 feel--that there are some aspects of the organisation of farming-as:an industry, to which it is important at this stage to-call attention.11. Our study of foreign conditions has impressed us with the large place occupied, both in the old countries o! Europe ancl in the great new states overseas, by methods of co-operation among farmers and by agricultural education. Agricultural co-operation includes associations for the purchase of supplies; for the preparation and sale of produce, for the provision of credit and for mutual insurance.12. Apart from enabling the farmer to purchase his supplies more cheaply and to get better prices for his produce, the full organisation of co-operation relieves the farmer of many problems of marketing&apos;so that he can give his attention more exclusively to the craft of farming. Foreign experience also shows - that co-operation is a natural basis of social and educational develop-ments in agriculture. Agriculture in this country stands -in need of sueh developments. &apos; &apos;-j13. We are impressed with the progress pf organisations for the co-operative marketing in this country of imports, not only from the European States, but from the British overseas domij nions. We aro of the opinion that these agencies will become even more effective, and that so long as our farmers remain in their present unorganised state both for production and marketing they are exposed to most serious disadvantages in comparison with oversea suppliers.14. It is true that co-operation for export to a distant market is easier as in such cases the individual farmer cannot readily create a private connection of his own. It necessitates loyalty among members. But a near market is itself more advantageous than a distant one if loyalty be observed. - -i 15. Co-operation must come, as it has done abroad, from the farmers themselves. The State has1 already recognised-&apos; its importance by substantial grants to the Agricultural Organisation Societies in England, Scotland and-Ireland. -We&apos;think that the Government might properly continue to make grants to such-societies,: and that such assistance-is of ^particular service :in: promoting co-operation among -small- holders and: allotment&apos; holders. &apos;.&amp;Mi)oni   19889li
16, Wej think,&apos; also, that in the educational schemes, particu-larly. of Agricultural Colleges and Farm Institutes, the study of the economic organisation of the industry in this and-other ,. countries should have fuller recognition.17. A second feature to which we wish to direct attention is the great-importance which has been attached in other countries to the development of agricultural education. As regards this country, we have had evidence on the subject from official sources and from the Agricultural Educational Association, We con-sider that in England, Scotland and Wales the schemes of agri-cultural education, including the Colleges, the Farm Institutes, and the local courses of instruction, are establishing themselves on lines suited to our conditions and that what is now required is the provision of more adequate resources. Farming, as a scattered industry, requires a special adaptation of the methods of diffusing technical knowledge. This is a marked feature of rural life in Europe, and its importance has nowhere been more realised than in the &quot;United States and Canada.; ..18. The important researches which are being carried out at the Colleges.in this country in turn emphasise this need for an effective means of bringing, information to the farmer-. This has been greatly assisted in recent years by the appointment in many counties of County Organisers.19. In England and Wales, these officials are appointed hy the County Agricultural Committees, but there is no obligation on a Committee to make an appointment, and in some important counties there is still no organiser. InScotland they are appointed by the Colleges, and rank as members of the staff. We think that the latter is the better system. It keeps the organiser mori closely in touch with sources of information. It also improves his status and security. The matter is of great importance for the efficiency of agriculture, and.we think that the possibility of adopting the Scottish system should be carefully considered.20. We are impressed by the research work which is being carried on at the (MLeges, and record our opinion that the country has a staff of agricultural experts second to none in ability and enthusiasm. Of the direct bearing of their work on agricultural productivity there can be no doubt- As examples of its direct value to the farmer we may mention the application of the method of hybridisation, which has great increased the yield of cereals; experiments on the improvement of poor pastures which have increased their meat-production capacity out of all proportion to the cost of the improvement; and the discovery of varieties of potatoes which are immune from wart disease.21. But still more do we wish to emphasise the need for the development of research work upon the economic problems of agriculture. Research in. problems of natural. science can do much, as indicated.above, for. the agricultural industry, but we regard it as a matter of first importance to extend research work
in the direction of testing new systems of&apos; farm management, particularly as regards the maintenance of live-stock on arable land. This practice is common in many European countries and is met with to a limited extent in Britain. Its effect on production and employment has been demonstrated and what is wanted is. further evidence on the financial aspects. -We consider that immediate steps . should be taken. to provide grants for research work in directions such as these, as. the complement of research , in natural science.- We would: point out that in the United States of America about . fifty per cent, of grants for research are made to investigations in farm economics, whereas in this country the proportion is less than ten per cent. .. .  31. .We submit the following recommendations : 22. Credit We have considered the proposals of the Com-mittee on Credit Facilities in Agriculture. With those which refer to long term credit we agree. We consider also that it is necessary to make provision so that farmers organising for the joint handling of their products should be able to obtain credit for the erection of buildings and purchase -of plant against the security of their uncalled capital. We have in mind matters of such national importance as the treatment of surplus milk.23. As regards short term and intermediate credit we think that the system would be more elastic, have a broader basis, and suit, more completely the existing conditions of British agriculture, if the Act which gives effect to the Credit Cornmittee&apos;s proposals were so drafted as not to exclude from State advances, or guarantees through the Joint Stock banks, approved associa-tions of farmers for purchase and sale. The security of the Government would be the -uncalled capital of the societies. Many, if not most, of the purposes for which short term credit is required by farmers are closely connected with the purchase of materials, either for the ordinary seasonal operations of farming or for minor improvements; and so far as facilities in this direction are obtained the resources of farmers are more freely available hr wages and other charges.24. Railway Rates. An immediate and material reduction of railway rates on farm produce and farm supplies (e.g., fertiliserSj feeding-stuffs, seeds, machinery, &amp;c.) is urgently. required. ,The existing rates restrict both purchase by the farmer and the sale by him of agricultural produce, and in many cases have made production unprofitable. If the Railway Rates Tribunal is unable to make a Substantial reduction in the transport of agri-cultural produce, we are of opinion that the Government should take the financial responsibility of a reduction of hot less than twenty-five per cent, on the existing rates.
25: Local Sates. The existing arrangements should bo amended (a) by making the contribution from the Exchequer a sum equal to half of the expenditure falling upon -rural rates in the preceding twelve months instead of-the sum fixed in 1896 as being at that time-half the rate, and (b) by making agricultural hereditaments (other than the farmhouse and cottages).as well as lands pay on half rates. These proposals would be in accord with the spirit of the earlier arrangement, would bring sub-Stantial relief in this respect and could be adopted at least temporarily until the settlement of the complex problem of rating has been arrived&apos; at.26. Wheat Offals. An import duty on wheat raises the price of flour to the consumer, and a subsidy on home-grown wheat, while not affecting the cost of flour to the consumer, imposes, a considerable charge on the Exchequer. But there is one way in which without cost to the industrial consumer the farmer can be given something which he asks for arid values. The dairy, pig and poultry industries are large and growing branches of our agriculture. They are particularly important to the small farmer. Eor all these classes of livestock, wheat offals are an important factor in economic feeding. The shortage and high prices of these offals have been a serious handicap to farmers and small-holders in recent years. It has been suggested in many quarters that the import of flour should be prohibited, or at least be subject to an import duty. It is probable that such action would not raise the price of flour in this country, for the existing milling capacity of this country is capable of an output equal to our total consumption of flour. We recommend, how-ever, that the import be left open, but that importers of wheat-flour should be required to send a corresponding proportion of wheat offals, e.g., twenty-five per cent, of offals to seventy-five per cent, of flour. In view of the location of the greater flour mills at the ports, it is also important to ensure that the supply of offals is by preference given to home consumers, and we recom-mend that ^an export duty on wheat offals of. ten per cent, ad valorem be imposed. Great importance is attached by farmers to this question of wheat offals, and we consider that the above provisions will be helpful to the large number of stock-owners in town and country.27. We have considered with some care whether any direct financial assistance to wheat-growing should be given by the Sfate. We have determined to make no recommendation.. The main reasons for this abstention are as follows :-In the first place, it seems to us more important to maintain the arable area generally than to maintain the area of any parti-cular crop, even one so important as wheat. So long as arable cultivation is maintained, labour will continue to be employed, on the land very much as at present; and it will always be possible to increase the proportion of wheat in time of war. We hope that the measures we recommend will contribute to maintain
the arable area, without recourse .to special encouragement of wheat-growing. &apos;In the second place, there are methods of arable stock-farming which would, if successful, give large employment to labour without letting down tillage. These methods are in the experi-mental stage, if not on their technical at least on their economic side. Hence, as we have already recommended (paragraph 21), we propose that a series of experiments should be carried out with a view to determining the economic advantage of the methods proposed. . -    -Until the effects of the measures proposed&apos; have been seen and the financial prospects of alternative methods of agriculture ascertained, we do not desire to prejudge the situation as it may present itself even a few years hence.28. Malting Barley. In connection with the maintenance of the present area of arable land, we have been led to consider the effects of some measure of assistance to the barley crop. This crop is widely distributed, and the larger part of the finer quality barley, used for malting purposes, is produced on some of the lighter soils, which are those most likely to go out of cultivation if prices for malting grain continue at an unremunerative level. We have had evidence upon the subject, and we recommend that a duty of 10s. a quarter be imposed on imported malting barley, to be collected at the brewery, distillery or malthouse, with a preference of one-third on barley imported from the Dominions.29. Hops. The serious condition of the hop-growing industry has been put very strongly to us. We do not regard the crop, either intrinsically or relatively, as of an importance approaching that of the barley crop; but as it represents, probably, the most intensive form of agriculture followed in this country, it is undesirable that it should be allowed to decline. Accordingly, we recommend that a duty of 20s. per owt. should be imposed on imports with a preference of one-third in&quot; favour of^ imports from the Dominions. We desire to couple with&apos; this recommendation the abolition of the Hop Control.30. Potatoes. Except as regards early potatoes, home supplies are sufficient and in the past year much in excess of the home demand. The cultivation of this crop affects a large number of farmers in many districts of the country; it provides a very great amount of employment, maintains the arable area in a high state of cultivation and furnishes the most important single supply of home grown food. The outlay involved per acre in growing the crop is very large. In the past season when a very large home crop was already coming on the market, imports of Dutch potatoes unable to find a market in Germany Were dumped into this country and con-tributed, to an extent which the quantity of the import might
not suggest, to the acute depression of the market. Prices fell and have remained far below cost of production, resulting in unprecedented losses. to the growers throughout England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland. There is a further consideration as regards this crop. The prevalence of wart disease and mosaic disease in countries from which supplies are imported is a menace to the home grown crop, and organised efforts have been made and restrictions imposed on home growers with a view to corn-bating the spread of. these and other potato diseases, in this country. We recommend that imports of foreign potatoes he permitted only, under general licence of the President of the Board of Trade, for specified periods, after consultation with the Minister of Agriculture as to the extent of home supplies and the freedom from disease of foreign imports.&apos;31. Sugar -Beet.-We have received considerable evidence of the importance attached to the development of the sugar beet industry, particularly in those arable areas which are suffering most, severely from the present depression. The peculiar value of this industry in the system of agriculture is recognised not only in the chief European agricultural States but also in the TJ.S.A. and in Canada, and has been one of the small farmers&apos; crops, and particularly useful as a means of employment. We recommend that the production of beet sugar should con-tinue to enjoy the benefit of exemption from the excise for a period sufficiently long to enable the experiment to be thoroughly tested.    *, 32. Milk Production-Teas country obtains its supply of fresh milk almost entirely from its home production. Eresh milk and cream should only be imported under license where there is satisfactory evidence that the conditions of their pro-duction and transport are subject to a standard of hygienic regulation equal to that required in this country. In respect of dried^milk, imports should be certified as free from adulteration ; and in the case of imports of preserved liquid milk the tins should plainly state the analysis of the contents.33. There is, however, a much larger question in connection with mills production in this country. There is evidence of a considerable increase in the number and extent of operations of farmers engaged in the production and supply of fresh milk. As a result there tends to be a recurring crisis, due to over-production of milk, particularly in summer, and resulting in considerable loss through wastage or uneconomic use of milk. The remedy for this lies in the erection by associations of farmers or by companies who purchase their milk, of milk-collecbing depots at local centres, equipped with plant for the proper treatment of the milk before railing, and for the conversion of the surplus milk into dried or preserved milk, butter or cheese. These societies are of great economic value, assisting payment by quality, economy in collection, and treatment of surplus&apos; milk, while the bye-products
can&apos;be used locally for stock feeding.- The advantage, of&apos;such depots, with the necessary equipment for converting, surplus milk, has been fully demonstrated in foreign and colonial expe-experience, while in recent years&apos; the developments of such depots in Scotland has been of much-benefit to the dairy farmer. We are of opinion that the State should actively encourage the formation of such societies or companies advancing loans to assist in. the erection of the necessary-plant, as has been done in Scotland. Further,, in the interests both of the farmers and of the food of the community, an active propaganda should-be carried on to increase the consumption of milk, as has been done with most marked success in recent years in the United States.34. Marking of Imported Produce. We recommend, that imports of agricultural produce should, as far as the classes of commodities make it practicable, be marked clearly so as to indicate the country of origin; also that steps be taken by the Departments of Agriculture to require misleading descriptions to be discontinued, and that measures be taken to prosecute and give publicity in such cases.35. Agricultural Wages. We have received evidence of the rates of agricultural wages in the chief European countries. In terms of money wages, agriculture is generally a badly paid industry. The money wages paid in this country are as high as those in any European country, and higher than in most. But it is exceedingly difficult to take account of the relative values of allowances, and to interpret wages in terms of the standard of. living. The conditions required to justify State regulation of wages in this country, as laid down in the Trade Boards Acts, are the absence of effective organisation and the prevalence of low wages. - Agriculture fulfils both these conditions. Much is argued as to the position which agriculture should take in national life. It cannot take its proper positon unless it shares the advantages of our social legislation. In this country, the rate of agricultural wages is of importance in relation to the whole Trade Board movement, since many of the industries under Trade Boards extend into rural districts, and the determination of Trade Board rates is liable to be affected by agricultural rates.: The agricultural industry in this country needs organisation. . In other aspects of organisation it is comparatively deficient in relation to foreign countries. The Wages Board offered the hope of a great development. We are aware of the great difficulties of the present situation in this country. But we put forward the following considerations of policy.    &apos;The greatest value of a Wages Board is in a period of depression in order to prevent demoralisation, not in a period of prosperity;; tor a Wages Board does not exist merely, to raise&apos; rates, but to&apos; ensure that the standard of payment is not fixed by,the inefficient farmer.   An industry in which labour is so immobile; and
unorganised affords:opportunity for its exploitation. Low wages are tod often coincident -with bad farming. . It must not be forgotten that whereas in other, industries: in which trade depres-siOn exists; the Poor Law and the Exchequer come to the assistance of the employer for the maintenance of-Ms normal equipment of employees, the farmer is much more bound, by the nature of his occupjation.to.carry his11 staff in bad times as well as good. He cannot close his farm as an industrial employer can shut down his factory. Therefore, while we wish to make it perfectly clear that we do not suggest that any particular form of assistance to the&apos;;fa;rmmg interest should be regarded as a: condition for the acceptance&quot;:of Wages..Boards, we are bound to give weight to twO important practical considerations.36. &quot;One ;is that in so large and widespread an occupation as agriculture a-Wages Board system cannot work without a certain degfee of willingness on the part of employers. And the other is that that degree of wdllingness is only likely, with human nature as it is, to be forthcoming if farmers can entertain a certain feeling of security with regard to their business prospects.&apos; 37. We would add that agriculture is an industry in which well organised and stable combination among labourers is ex-ceedingly difficult to create and keep alive. The events of the laistTyear are. sufficient proof of this. Wages Board machinery in England and Wales our proposal does not extend to Scotland - would tend to stimulate and strengthen combination among agricultural labourers, and we hold that that may properly be a further motive for its adoption.&apos; 38. We consider that the industry is too large for control by ai central Wages Board assisted by County Advisory Com-mittees, and further, that this form of administration is unnecessarily/expensive. We recommend instead the establish-ment of &quot;about six District Wages Boards to cover the whole of England and Wales, each of them having executive powers within their own areas and uncontrolled by any Central Board. We desire to emphasise the fact that in our opinion these Boards should: confine themselves to the enactment of minimum wages and the granting of permits of exemption, and that they should not be regarded as fixing in effect the actual rates of pay.. 3i). Belief of Rural Unemployment. We also wish to direct attention to the preparation of schemes as early- as possible for relieving rural unemployment during the coming year. In. this connection we consider (1) that the scheme of field drainage which has&apos; been iri operation in Scotland during the last two years has been useful; both in giving employment and in indreasing&apos;the productive value of the land; (2) that in certain areas afforestation operations in draining, fencing&apos; arid planting offer rhearis of employment which are of public utility.     &apos;&apos;   &apos;&apos;
40, -Assistance &apos; should - be v given - in developing-r preferably, through county or infer-eoudty; organisatiohs^dimei--burning; and kmestone-orushing. Large-tra,cts,. of: country are urgently in need of lime, and assistance.given in. this.way.:W.o.uld mailredly. increase production. The Danish Government has for many years subsidised the liming of certain classes of land, the sum allocated to assist transport of lime in 1921 being approximately  66,000.41 Local Administrative Machinery Tne experience of other States as well as of this country, indicates the great importance of local machinery for the purpose of advancing the organisation of the industry. We consider that the machinery -of County Agricultural Committees in Scotland, which, for reasons mainly of economy, has been brought into abeyance, should be set again in action. We have already indicated that we regard the close association of the county organisers with the agricultural colleges as a matter of importance.42. We are well aware that there, are many subjects which it has been impossible for us to deal with in. this Interim Report, e.g., the question of small holdings, but we propose to deal with, such matters in a later Report.43. Agriculture is.still the greatest national industry. Properly balanced manuring of crops and feeding of live stock, the pro-gressive selection of more productive strains both in animal and in plant husbandry, the steady reduction of the heavy annual losses due to plant and animal diseases, the improvement in the economy of farm management, and the better organisation of the industry for purchase, production and sale, these and other realisable economies represent an ultimate gain which can hardly be measured. But to attain this result there is required a policy steadily pursued year in, year out, which combines research, education and organisation. &quot; Better farming, -better business, better living&quot; is the complete policy, and no part of this can be neglected.We must add, however, that agriculture also illustrates in a remarkable degree that characteristic of large-scale production under modern conditions of transport to which attention has been increasingly directed viz., liability to disproportionate disturbance from the shock of sudden ancl often temporary fluctuations of supply. The desirability of making plans ahead, and of keeping together the labour force, are especially important in an industry which is in any case liable to the vicissitudes of the seasons, and in which labour is necessarily of but limited mobility. It is for these reasons that, without committing our-selves to, any prediction as to what may emerge from the experi-ence of, the next few years, we have agreed to recommend a cautious use of the power of the State to obtain for the operations
F* Reservation-by.Professor D. H. Macgkegor.i . I regard, the. liability under paragraph 24 as too indefinite-.

The Tribunal has still to receive and consider, and compare with British cohdi-tions, evidence both from countries which have protected agriculture and from those which maintain it successfully under free trade. Apart from the question of general j)policy, I think that, the restrictions on the import of flour and export of offals, if; aohhihistra.tiVely practicable, will tend to increase the price of flour; and that the duties on barley and hops, in view of the&apos; relation oi^home to foreign supplies in the brewing industry, will1 have doubtful effects on.the barley area especially.D.
