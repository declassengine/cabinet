Massey may be prevented from leaving lew Zealand.(b) that the best date for the two Conferences would be in the autumn of this year.-)Draft tele trams to the Dominions j, together with separate messages to Mr,, Bruce end Mr* Massey (which I append to this Memorandum) have been prepared by the Inter-departmental Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir E, Llewellyn Smith, and are submitted for the consideration of the Cabinet before despatch.1,-s
As to the question of dates, the middle of Octoberhas been suggested, since it is thought that this might suit the convenience of any delegates from the Dominions and India who had. previously attended the 4th Assembly of the League of Nations,,But I have been asked by the Inter-departmental Committee to call attention to&apos;the fact that the League of Nations has just issued invitations to a Conference on Customs formalities and other similar matters to take place at Geneva on October 15th, and that some of the Commercial experts of the Governments represented at the Imperial Economic Conference would normally attend the Geneva Conference-I understand that the Secretary of State for India will arrange for the necessary.communication to India after the telegrams to the Dominions have been approved.I think also that the time has now come for the Irish Free State Government to be informed of&quot; the two Conferences, and I should propose to arrange accordingly after the telegrams to the Dominions have gone,,I may add that Sir Ho Llewellyn smith s Committee lias been at work since November, and has made considerable progress -in the task of preparing memoranda, etc, for discussion at the Economic Conference ..I understand that the Prime Minister proposes to appoint a similar committee, under the chairmanship of Sir Maurice Hankey In co-operation with the Colonial Office, to consider what action should be taken as to the preparation of an Agenda for the Imperial Conference,.(Signed)   DEVONSHIRE..   -Colonial Office,27th February, 1923.

February,    Following from Prime Ministerfor your Prime Minister,   Begins.   Answers to my message of November 89th as to suggested Imperial Economic Conference now complete and I find that it is generally agreed that it would be of advantage to hold such a Conference,    I gather however that there Is a feeling that the best results would not be achieved if an Economic Conference were held independently of a Conference of Prime Ministers,and therefore that it would be best to hold Imperial Economic Conference and a Meeting of the Imperial Conference concurrently..Prime Ministers present at the- latter would thus be enabled to be in constant consultation with their colleagues who were taking part in the forrnor, and if necessary could themselves attend the most important meetings of the Economio Conference.This procedure would be quite in accordance with views of Cabinet here, and for myself I should greatly welcome opportunity of discussing this year with my fellow Prime Ministers the many urgent problems cf foreign policy and defence which confront us.As to dates it would be impossible tr. make necessary preparations before June at earliest and the answers to my message of November 29th indicate that mooting in autumn would be preferred,ffe/
.ve accordingly suggest that both Conferences should start, about middle of October in London.Please let me know as soon as you can whether you agree&apos; to holding: both Conferences concurrently and whether time suggested will suit you.As to agenda for Economic Conference we would send you as.. soon as possible detailed list of subjects suggested for-discussion...iis to agenda for Imperial Conference our idea would be that arrangements should follow generally those for 1921 Conference.,Similar- telegram sent to other Primo Ministers.Ends.
DRAFT   B.DRAFT TELEGRAM to governor GENERALMELBOURNE.My telegram of Following from prime Minister for your Prime Minister,     Begins. Many thanks for your telegram of 24th February as to Economic and Imperial Conferences,     I am answering it in my message of to-day but I feel bound to make clear to you position of present British Government on tariff question,     I announced before election that this Parliament would not make any fundamental change in the fiscal s7/stem of this country, and pledge has since been repeated several times in Parliament here*     Hence when discussing any proposals put forward with regard to preference our attitude would necessarily be governed by this pledge..     This will not however prevent your raising the subject, but I feel sure that you will agree that a broad policy of economic co-operation such as we hope to realise must include much that is not fiscal and I am confident that proposed Economic Conference could do useful work in many directions.

PROOF.5820421No.   -The SECRETARY OF STATE to the GOVERNORS-GENERAL andGOVERNOR.(Sent 6.20 p.m., 29th November, 1922.) Telegram. [Answered by Nos. 60232, 60968.](Canada.)(Commonwealth of Australia.)(New Zealand.)(Union of South Africa.)(Newfoundland.)29th November. Following from Prime Minister for your Prime Minister ;-  Begins: As you know, my colleagues and I are anxious to help the development of trade within the Empire in any way in our power. The most promising method of securing this is, in: our opinion, co-operation between the&apos; various Governments, and we are therefore anxious to take counsel with them.A meeting of the Imperial Conference is due next year, and will, I hope, take place, but it seems to us that there would be advantage in holding an Imperial Economic Conference distinct from and in advance of this, which could survey all the possibilities of joint and reciprocal action in the economic sphere.I should be grateful if you would let me know how you would view this suggestion and whether you would be prepared to send representatives to such a Conference if the idea commended itself generally.We have given some preliminary consideration to the scope of an Economic Conference such as we have in mind, and our tentative suggestion is that its general reference should be to study the possibilities of co-operation in the development of the resources of the British Empire and the strengthen-ing of economic relations between its constituent parts.Among the subjects which suggest themselves as suitable for considera-tion would be those for the fuller development of natural resources and of inter-Imperial commerce, shipping, and communications generally, as well as co-ordinated action for the improvement of technical research and the organization of economic intelligence; and also any proposals for the unification-tion of law or practice in the Empire in matters bearing upon trade develop-ment, eg., Empire Patents, Bills of Lading, Enforcement of Judgments, etc. Not the least important aspect of development in this connexion for some, at any rate, of the Governments concerned, is that of Oversea Settlement; and the progress up to date of co-operation in this respect on the lines laid down in resolution of Imperial Conference of 1921, and the possibilities of further progress, would naturally come under review.Certain organizations for economic co-operation have already been estab-lished on an inter-Imperial basis. Work of such bodies would naturally come up for consideration as would also the recommendations of Conferences and Commissions on special subjects which have met and reported in recent years.Conference might also wish to survey certain aspects of the external commercial relations of the Empire. For example, it might think well to consider the question of mutual co-operation amongst the various Govern-ments to.safeguard their economic interests in relation to foreign countries and any proposals for promoting international arrangements for the more equitable treatment of commerce. One or two subjects call for consideration as regards both their Imperial and International aspects; for example, &apos; position of Government enterprises as regards taxation and legal liability.
We should be greatly obliged for full expression of your opinion after you have had time to consider suggestions outlined above, and also for your views as to the best time for holding such a Conference if agreed to and as to the number, of representatives. Tentatively we suggest that it should take place about April, 1923, and that there should be not more than three delegates from each Government accompanied by the necessary expert advisers.Similar telegram is being sent to the other Prime Ministers and also to India.   We contemplate, of course, that the Conference should include representation of the interests of the Colonies and Protectorates.  Ends.  Devonshire.----- m
PROOF. 60232UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA. The GOVERNOR-GENERAL to the SECRETARY OF STATE. (Received 2.8 a.m., 5th December, 1922.) Telegram.4th December. Following from Prime Minister for your Prime Minister :  Begins: Your message 29th November,* Imperial Economic Conference. I have no objection to such a Conference, and am on the whole favourably inclined to your; suggestion. I am, however, opposed to holding it at different time from Prime Ministers&apos; Conference. Custom has grown up to hold Conference on economic and trade questions at the same time as Prime Ministers&apos; Conference. This happened in 1918 and again 1921. While Prime Ministers under your chairmanship discuss question of Empire and foreign policy the other Conference under chairmanship of Colonial Secretary deals with practical economic issues. But Prime Ministers are always avail-able to join in economic discussions, and do so whenever matters of far-reaching importance are discussed. I would suggest that this precedent of the last two Conferences be followed again. Apart from precedent it will be most inconvenient for the Union to be properly represented by Ministers in two great Conferences held in London in the same year. Union Parliament generally sits from January till June, and the latter part of June, as well as in month of July, are available for Conference in London. To send Ministers to London before June while session is on will be practically impossible. But after that I could proceed to London with one or two colleagues who could take part in Economic Conference and call me in when-ever grave matters of principle or policy are under discussion. If you find it impossible to delay Economic Conference as I have suggested and decide to hold it in April of (?or) thereabouts Government of Union of South Africa would have to be represented by our High Commissioner in London.

My Prime Minister sends following message for you: Begins: Idea of holding Imperial Economic Conference as outlined your cable 29th November* is viewed favourably by our Government, which will be prepared to send representatives. It is extremely doubtful if Con-ference took place about April whether any Ministers could attend as delegates, certainly not more than one, as Session of our Parliament will be in progress at that time, and in all probability will extend well into June.Late spring, summer, or fall months would be better suited to our con-venience for conference purposes.We agree that number of delegates sent by each Government should not exceed three.

Enclosure 1 in No.Telegram from the Secretary of State to Viceroy, Commerce Department.29th November. P. 4659. Prime Minister has sent following telegram to Prime Ministers of Dominions, and I send it to you accordingly :-[B,egins: As you know . . - . [see No. 58204] .... Colonies and Protectorates.  Ends.]I hope you will concur in my view that India should be represented at the Conference. In spite of the fact that the question of Imperial Preference is not quoted specifically as one of the subjects to be discussed, there is no doubt that it falls within their scope, and representatives of some Governments may be expected to bring the question up. India&apos;s position in relation to this matter&apos;, as you will doubtless agree, is very special, as there has been no time for your Government to collect opinions on the Indian Fiscal Commission^ recommendations, and to form your own matured opinion. It may seem to you desirable to instruct your represen-tatives that should the question of Imperial Preference be raised they should simply state that for reasons stated in the preceding sentence they cannot join in the discussion. The representatives of India could, of course, usefully participate in the discussion on several other of the suggested subjects.Enclosure 2 in No.Telegram from Viceroy, Commerce Department.8th December. P. Your important telegram of the 29th November received asking for our views on the proposal that an Imperial Economic Conference should be held next spring, in advance of, and distinct from, the Imperial Conference.The various subjects which are indicated as possible subjects for consideration represent, we recognize, merely provisional and tentative ideas, and there is no necessity to draw your attention to the fact-which, indeed, you recognize that there have been discussions on some of these subjects at Conferences of recent dates. We need only refer to the 1920 and 1921 Conferences on Customs, Forestry, Patents and Statistics. Moreover, the Imperial Shipping Committee and the Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau exist for the very objects His Majesty&apos;s Government have in view- At the same time we appreciate the importance of the issues raised, not only to the United Kingdom, but also, though &quot;possibly in a less degree of immediate urgency, to the Empire, by the progressive deterioration of purchasing power and economic conditions in Europe; and we agree in principle that the urgency of these problems makes it well worth consideration whether they should not be remitted to a Common Council of the Empire for re-examination, in the hope of finding a solution equally advantageous to India, the Dominions, and the Home Government. India will certainly agree to participate in the proposed Conference if the Dominions&apos; reply is favourable, and if they are prepared to co-operate. It will be understood by His Majesty&apos;s Government, however, that in approaching the Conference, the Government of India must adopt some degree of reserve.  We take*&apos;No. 58204.INDIA OFFICE to COLONIAL OFFICE.(Received 20th December, 1922.)[Answered by No.      .]Sir, India Office, 19th December, 1922.I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to transmit to you, for information, copy of telegraphic correspondence with the Government of India on the subject of the proposed Imperial Economic Conference.Reference to previous correspondence: Letter to the India Office of the 30th November, 1922.I am, &amp;c.F. W. DUKE.PROOF 62684
it that one possible line of co-operation between India and the United Kingdom may lie in plans to accelerate, with finances supplied on favourable terms from home, railway and other developments in India, on the understanding that material, &amp;c, be ordered from British manufacturers. We are becoming more and more inclined to the view that in a bold policy of productive development lies the only permanent solution of India&apos;s financial troubles. Such development involves inter alia better transport for products, and this means further railway extension. It is necessary to say that if proposals on the above lines are made, we shall examine them with the greatest care, but we feel bound to indicate the existence of certain difficulties. Some of these are of a practical nature. Having regard to the object in view, railway development is the most hopeful form of development, if we have correctly interpreted the trend of ideas which His Majesty&apos;s Government have dn mind. But the hands of railway administrations are already full with their exist-ing rehabilitation programme. It is doubtful whether they can spend with advan-tage more than the money already earmarked for rehabilitation, and as a charge on revenue is involved in most capital expenditure on rehabilitation, more money could not be provided by us -without embarrassment. With regard to new construction, certain preliminaries, such as surveys, would need to be undertaken, and before any large programme of new construction could be embarked upon, probably a year&apos;s delay must take place; nevertheless we should be prepared to examine (1 any scheme) with the greatest care, and would do our utmost to speed up preliminary work provided that other conditions can be arranged to mutual advantage. There is also another difficulty, but of a different nature. The whole trend of Indian thought and Indian feeling is, as you are aware, on the side of decreasing, rather than increasing, India&apos;s dependence on the United Kingdom for manufactured articles, and it may be that an alteration in our fiscal policy may be made with this end in view. It is probable that Indian opinion would regard with great disfavour any proposals which might bear the construction that their intention was to base the future commercial connexion between India and the United Kingdom on an increase in the export of raw materials from India to England, and the import of manufactured articles into India from England.It had been thought necessary that these points should be mentioned..His Majesty&apos;s Government will doubtless realize that it will be necessary to have our Legislature behind us in carrying into effect any proposals that may be made, and this may not be easy in view of what we have said; but as already stated, if the proposed Conference is agreed to by the other Dominions, India will certainly desire to participate, and our representatives will attend with every desire to sur-mount difficulties and to be helpful. In regard to Imperial Preference, the Government of India reserves full liberty of action for their representatives, even, if necessary, for the reasons given in your telegram, No. 4659, to the extent of their abstaining from discussion on that subject. We understand that the question of overseas settlement excludes all discussion of emigration of Indians-We agree that not more than three representatives should be sent.As regards date of Conference, date provisionally suggested is awkward for us, and we should prefer May, or, better still, June. It will be necessary to brief our representatives very carefully. It will be difficult for our Departments to prepare the briefs during the sittings of the Legislature, as the time of our leading officials will be largely occupied with work of Legislature.

Prime Minister has asked me to send following telegram to you: Begins: In reply to your telegram of 29th November* re proposed Economic Conference, Commonwealth is alive to the importance of improving the Empire Economic relations, and as you know, Prime Minister holds very decided views on the necessity of developing the Empire&apos;s trade, and has set these out on very many occasions in Britain both during and after the War.Australia has done everything in her power to encourage trade between various parts of the Empire, and particularly with Great Britain. She has given Britain very great advantage under- her tariff, has concluded a reciprocal tariff with New Zealand, and is carrying on negotiations with Canada for a similar purpose.As the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom knows, while under the Commonwealth tariff Britain is accorded preference on practically every item, the preference granted to Australia under British tariff does not go very far, and Australian goods have to face very keen competition of foreign countries in British market. Quite recently, as is well known, a most invidious distinction was made between Canadian and Australian products under the Cattle Embargo Act. The position, then, seems to be one which calls for action by Britain rather than mere discussion. If you want us to buy more British goods there is only one way in which it can be done Britain must buy more Australian products; that is the position. And it is respectfully suggested that Britain might with great advantage to herself and to the Empire give products of Australia preference over foreign goods in British markets.It is not necessary to stress the importance of Empire trade development or value of Dominions markets for British goods. Australia is one of the very best markets British manufacturers have. No European country corn-pares with it, and if given suitable encouragement it will become a still better market. All facts are perfectly well known; a Conference cannot alter them nor can it do anything more than pass the resolution. What is really wanted is action by Britain. Ends. Govern al-General .
Telegram frpm the Governor General of the Cpmraonwealth of Australia to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Dated 24th February,1923. (Received Colpnial Office 5.30 a.m. 24th February,1923).Following from Prime Minister for your Prime Minister;-  Begins:-  With further reference tp your tele-gram 29th November&apos; my colleagues and I have again considered the question of partioijution in Economic Conference. Whilst appreciating the difficulties which exist and which have hitherto prevented better understanding being arrived at between Great&apos;Britain and Dominions with regard to reciprocal tariff arrangement it is strongly felt that present position of world&apos;s trade is such that quest ion should, be again definitely raised for consideration of government and people of Great Britain.    Whether conference can achieve all those things which You suggest for discussion is doubtful but presence of Dominions Ministers in Great Britain with the object of discussing definite issues would d$ a great deal to create proper atmosphere and make: for reasonable chance of success.    In my opinion difficulties are all at your end. Dominions are anxious-and willing-to co-operate..    Suggest that definite Agenda be drawn up and date fixed for meeting Q&apos;t conference.    It is useless to approach such a conference unless prepared to face the practical issue.    Commonwealths position such that it will have to press some further prefer-ence in return for substantial preference granted British goodsWith regard to Imperial Conference referred to in your telegram above .mentiQned.my colleagues and Iconsider
consider this of paramount importance.    Defence question is becoming very vital in Australia and importance of arriving at -understanding between Great Britain and Dominions before any further action is-taken cannot be too strongly emphasised.    Consider that both conferences should take place simultaneously as success- of economic conference depends absolutely upon presence of Prime Minister who could not spare time to visit England,on Mo separate occasions.    Many matters of importance such as- so^k^ng policy-    -CQiiraunication^etc , in addition to defence policy necessitates early consultabxon.   So far as Australia is concerned September or October should be satisfactory time.    Several outstanding questions which must await result of decision arrived at make the holding of con-ferences this year very irrrpcrtant tp Australia.    Ends,GOVERNOR GENERAL.
