MS. CHARMS DUNCAN, M.p.:     Mr.  Time Minister, I have been asked to introduce this Deputation from the Farmers Union, the National Union of Agricultural Wo racers and the agricultural section of the Workers&apos; Union.   Mr. Walker will in the first place state the case for the agricultural workers, and. Mr. German will introduce Mr. Bobbins, who will make a statement on behalf of the Farmers&apos; Union.MR. R.B.WALKER: Mr. Prime Minister, on behalf of the Workers&apos; side I am asked to submit to you this statement, and I will hand a copy in to you, In thanking you for the opportunity of thisinterview, especially in the light of present circumstances, I desire to say that the extreme urgency of the situation as we see it is the only explanation we have to offer for encroaching on your time at the present moment.Since the cancelling of the Agriculture Act and. the abolition of the Wages Board, agriculture has been dependent upon Local Conoili-ation Committees as the means of adjusting differences upon wages etc., in the industry.    These have been in operation for some eighteen months, and have produced various agreements.    It has been evident however,for sometime that the further they have proceeded the more difficult has become their task.   At the present moment, there are in fact, only agreements in 13 districts out of 65 and these being for a short period, it is doubtful if they will be continued.   It will, therefore, we fear, te impossible to avoid a complete breakdown of the machinery.Briefly, the facts are that offers of wages now made by the employers are such as the workers cannot live upon,.as low as SO/lO per week or 5d. per hour being the terms offered.    This means, having regard to the present cost of living, a much lower standard than that which obtained in pre-war clays, and which by general consent consti&quot; tuted nothing short of a scandal in rural life.   With the best will in the world to use the machinery of conciliation to its fullest extent it must be obvious that we cannot give our sanction and support to a condition of things which takes the Agricultural Labourers back to a position so much worse than that which has been so severely criticised in the past.i &apos;: ! : : 1. ..&apos; :!
with a desire to do all that it is possible to keep our relationship with the Employers on a basis of harmony   and good vrf.ll, we have met the Central body of the Farmers&apos; Union to ascertain whether it is possible for some action to be taken nationally whereby the difficulties that have arisen, and which are likely to arise, could be removed from their local bearings and dealt with on national lines as is prevalent in other industries.The situation is one of great seriousness, and the proposed wages and conditions have given rise to grave misapprehension-hension, and it is difficult.to say what may eventuate there-from.   The situation is one, therefore, of great urgency, as already in various counties, men are being locked out because they cannot agree to the reductions of their wages and the increase in their working hours,?^e who are acting for the Labourer are not actuated by any narrow interest so much as by a   .desire to secure national well being by the obtaining for the rural worker conditions which will, give him satisfaction in the present and hope for the future.   To this end wo therefore ask the Government to at . once re-establish the Agricultural Wages Board.MB, G33MAN:   I am going to ask Mr, Bobbins, Chairman of the Committee, to make a statement to you.   Mr. bobbins has been mainly concerned with the preparation of that statement, and he will therefore he best able to deal with any criticisms you may like to make.    Before calling upon Mr. Bobbins, I wish,, as President of the national Farmers1  Union, to say that the two statements submitted to you must be considered as separate and must not be regarded as mutually agreed proposals; -
Mr. _R.fi:.. Robins,-       -Mr, Prime Minister:-   We are ft I 3conscious of the burden of foreign and domestic problems which continue to weigh upon yourself and your colleagues and we realise that the condition of agriculture has engaged, your serious attention since you assumed Office,    Vie desire to place before you, very shortly, our views on the two issues with which you are confronted, viz., fl)    The fundamental question of national policy, and (2)   The question of the immediate relief to be afforded to the industry.The first issue, Sir, is one of supreme national importance but it may be reduced to very brief terms. That is to say, the Government must state clearly and unequivocally what it expects from the industry and whether it desires the industry to be conducted on a strictly economic or individualist basis, or upon a political and social basis.   If the Government intimates its desire to see the industry   organised on a strictly economic basis it must be prepared to face uncomplainingly diminished food production, diminished rural polulation and the. consequent flocking of the rural population to the towns, the laying down to grass of all but the most fertile lands and the reversion to what is known as &quot;ranch farming&quot;. Further, it should in justice to the industry repeal the Safeguarding of Industries Act and remove all -other forms of protection and all subsidies granted to other industries in this country, as well as cease to subsidise the development of agriculture in the Dominions through the Empire settlement Act.If, on the other hand, the Government decides that in. the interests of the State it is necessary to reduce our dependence upon imported food supplies to a minimum, to secure an output from the soil in excess of the economic
maximum, and to retain or increase, at an adequate living wage, the existing numbers of workers employed on the land, then this involves the organisation of the industry upon a political and social basis and imposes upon it services of a non-economic oharacter for which tho nation must be prepared to pay.Upon this fundamental issue we understand that you prefer to reserve final judgment pending the receipt of tho Report of the Tribunal of Economists which you appointed with the full approval of all parties in the House of Commons &quot;to enquire into the methods which have been adopted in other countries during the last fifty years to increase the prosperity of agriculture and to secure the fullest -possible use of the land for the production of food and the employment of labour at a living wage and to-advise as to the methods by which those results.could be achieved in this country&quot;.We acknowledge the tribute to the importance of the issue&apos; raised by us implied in the appointment of this Tribunal of eminent economists and in the respect shown in anticipa-tion to their judgment.   At the same time, Sir&apos;, we would respectfully remind you that the progress of events since the appointment of the Tribunal has very much increased the ? urgency of a decision and we express the hope that this will be forthcoming at the earliest possible moment.Vie now turn to tho second issue confronting the Government, which is our primary concern to-day.At the Old Kent Road Baths, in the course of the General Election, you stated:    &quot;I am afraid we are coming intoconditions almost as bad as in the Lighties ..... There isone thing I do say that, in addition to the need which the actual condition of agriculture   produces of doing our best
to help it, it has another claim.     The way in whioh agrieul-turehas been shoved, from pillar to post, by passing Bills and then repealing them, has enormously aggravated the position of agriculture.   Por that alone, we owe them some compensation./ This statement of yours has been accepted by all sections of the industry as proof that you are not unmindful of the very serious difficulties in which the industry finds itself, due to circumstances beyond the control of agriculturists. Since that date, however, the gravity of the situation has increase do As you have no doubt learnt from the Press, arable farmers in Norfolk: find themselves unable from their depleted resources to add to the wage of 25/- which they have recently been paying for a 50 hours&apos; week, and are compelled to ask; their workers to accept the same wage for the longer hours required to overtake seasonal work.Such is the recommendation issued by our Norfolk Oounty Branch to its members in order to maintain the present weekly wage to workers, and we are sure that the farmers will respond to the absolute limit of their financial resources. We are afraid however, that in some cases their limited, resources will render them unable to employ the men for more than 50 hours at the lower rate.   The recommendation of the County Branch is, of course, equivalent to asking the worker to accept a reduction in his wage rate of -g-d per hour.   The prospect before the worker is indeed deplorable, but on thu other hand it is almost impossible to exaggerate the gravity of the position in which very many of those whom we represent are placed.   As events are moving, the position to-day in Norfolk will to-morrow be the position throughout..the. whole -of England and &quot;Jales wherever the farmer depends to any considerable extent upon arable farming.If this is allowed to take place, we fear that it may have consequenceswhlch will prevent the discussion of principle in that sane and deliberate way in which alone a
question of. such.vital national importance should be discussed; we fear that If will put beyond the reach of help many employ-era   and many more workers now engaged in the industry, and that it must involve a serious economio loss to the community, whatever may be the ultimate decision of the country whtah will govern the conditions of food production and rural welfare for the future.   Holding these views, we felt that we should be lacking in our duty to those whom we represent and to the country if we did not approach you, Sir, and ask you to receive this deputation so that we could lay them before your Government in this the most direct method opento  USiThe crisis has not oome upon us&apos; without any warning. Many months have elapsed sinoe we saw signs of what was comings     In August of last year we sought an interview with the Ministry of Agriculture of the late Government and placed before   him   the      information which had reached us from all parts of the country.   Later in the year there took pis oe a series of conferences between the employers&apos; and the workers&apos; organisations      on the position of the industry.   These conferences vtere of a very frank, and we think we might add, of a very friendly, character, and raised high hopes through-out the countryside.     The facts of the position were fully discussed, but it was felt that no useful constructive discussion oould proceed without a clear definition by the Government of the fundamental basis upon which they wished the industry to be conducted.    It is unnecessary for us to recall the circumstances in which we failed to obtain such a definition from the late Government.   Since you assumed office we have continued independently   to press this question.Pending your decision, however, on the Report of the Tribunal of Economists, we regard it as essential that some
immediate temporary steps should be taken to deal with the situation now existing.     Unless means can be found to cope with it,then undoubtedly we are faced with the certainty of a groat addition to the number of unemployed agricultural&apos; workers, a decline of wage rates to a figure which we hesitate to forecast, and an enormous increase in the already -rising numbers of agricultural bankruptcies.On the latest official returns of prices published by the Ministry of Agriculture and taking also the official returns of the average yield per acre for the various crops, the return to the farmer to-day is only  9 per acre for wheat, about  7 per acre for barley and oats, and  10 per acre for potatoe s,Upon detailed costings which are laying before the Tribunal of Economists, and. which have been compiled from independent scientific sources, these returns represent a loss of at least    per acre on wheat,  3 per acre on oats  4 per acre on barley, and from  10 to  15 per acre on potatoes.     These losses, coming on top of serious losses / in the preceding year,   are altogether beyond the depleted resources of the arable farmers in this country to cope with.The farmer bannot shut down his farm in the way in which a manufacturer can temporarily close down his factory.&apos;  There are, however, certain steps which the farmer can take to reduce his commitments, but any such steps once taken are difficult - and. indeed impossible within a short period. -to retraoe.On land that is suitable for laying down to grass, he adopts this means of reducing his commitments.   On the land that remains under the plough, if he has the considerable
capital required and the covenants of his tenancy agreement permit he achieves approximately the same results by removing hedges, by laying field to field, and by cultivating on a less intensive scale larger areas.But on the considerable areas of light land in this country at present under the plough which are not suitable for laying down to grass j we are afraid there is little prospect before us but to see these lands go derelict, to become game preserves, while their present occupiers are driven out of the industry either via the Bankruptcy Court, or otherwise. You yourself, Sir, have said that you are afraid, that we are coming into conditions almost as bad as in the &apos;eighties.     In the &quot;eighties the situation similar to that which we have just described developed very slowly. To-day it is developing very rapidly.     They present a prcspect which we regard with dismay, but by ourselves we are powerless to avert it.     V/e therefore ash you seriously to consider whether pending a final decision on the question of permanent policy, some temporary measure of assistance cannot be devised by the Government which would at any rate alleviate the present degree of distress. Such a measure we believe is urgently required in the national interest having regard not only to the immediate prospects of a serious extension of unemployment and. destitution in the countryside reacting upon the towns, but also to the danger that the present rapid course of events, if unchecked, may seriously prejudice the future permanent conditions of food production in this country.
Q-HS PBIME MIMST3B:     Is thst all you wish to submit? MB. GBTOH:     Yes,2H3 PEE IS MIDI STUB,:     Gentlemen, we quite realise the serious position of agriculture,,     This is the second year in which your capital has been depleted, and it is obviously a very serious situation^     At the time of the Election I had the facts well in my mind, and perhaps you will remember I stated what was the general policy of the Government as far as I could at the time,     iiihat you seem to ask is that some-thing should be done by the Government to prevent the fall in the production of foodstuffs.     It seems to me that that is only possible in one of two ways, cither by a   big subsidy, the extent of which no one can forajoo,   or by Protection,is regards the subsidy,   you know that that was tried, end that it was found impracticable,   and I do not think there is any possibility of any large subvention by the State to this Industry to help it to get on to an economic basis* As regards Protection,   I think you know as well as I do, that the Public is not ready for that, ancl you could not get a majority for it.     That also seems to be shut out,     I said in my letter of november&apos;&apos;&apos; the 9th that that could not be done, but I indicated some other means by which the Industry might be helped,     These means were in relation to credit facilities, rating, education and adjustment of prices.     All these have been taken up by the Government.     You know that a Committee is sitting in regard to the difference in prices paid by the consumer and the prices at which the commodities are issued by the farmer.     A Credit Facilities Bill is being prepared and will be introduced very shortly.     The same is true with regard to Bating,    though that is a difficult problem, and It is possible that we may not be able to deal with that this year, though   I hope we shall.       But with   regard to your larger questions,-   I do not see what can be done, or what you could expect the Government to do.     You come to
rae and say the position is very had, and yon ask the Govern-ment to put it righto     We should, be only too glad. If we were ahle to do so;   we realise the position in which your industry is placed, but I do not see any praotioal scheme by which that can be done.     As regards the Committee of Enquiry, which I hope will report shortly, I do not know what they will re-commend:   ?/e will have to oonsider their report when it cornea: I am sorry to say that on tho big question, which filled every-bodyrs mind, during the war - when everybody felt the. urgent necessity of increasing agricultural produce, steps were taken to secure that increase.     But the area of the arable land which was thereby increased has apparently gone back to what it was before the war,     I am sorry indeed to have to give so discouraging an answer.     But, unless you have yourselves some practical suggestion to put to me, it comes to this, does it not?     You say the industry is so bad that if there is to be proper food production at home, the Government must do it, How can that be done?MR, G. DALLAS:   What about the case of the agricultural labourers?     It is obvious that their position i3 terrible, and it is becoming more terrible.     We know that the farmer does not contend, in any way that it is note     The labourer is at present right down to the bottom.THE PRIMS MINISTER:   I admit that, and I cannot say any-thing about the dispute that you are having with the farmer. But it comes to this:   is the industry to be self-supporting, or is it not, and you have to bear in mind, after all, that what agriculture is suffering now is a direct result of the war. I think that the agricultural Industry is in a worse position than almost any other industry, but they have all suffered; but the question is, is agriculture to be. self-supporting, or to be supported by the states     I think the latter is impossible. I would like if I could to make you realise that if there were any way, we would like to help you, but it seems to me
that agriculture must live on an economic basis. ME. DUNCAN:    If it can,THE P1IM3 MI HIS TEH-:   If it can, end do you not think you are exaggerating a little about land going out of cultivation? Vrom all I have gathered and tried to understand of this particular matter, I do not think it should be worse than pre-war *MR, GE2MAB:   It is much worse than in 1914,,THE PRIMS MINISTER:   You have had two bad years, but that will not continue surely.MR. GBRMAH:   From the figures given by me as President of the Farmers11 Union and my colleagues for the Tribunal, and which figures were confirmed at the discussion with Professor Ruston of Leeds it is obvious that it Is impossible to pro-duce cereals at the present time at anything but a loss,THE PRIME MINISTER:    But it is the fact is it not that few British farmers produce cereals alone*MR. GERMAN:   Many of the East Anglian, East Yorkshire, the Wolds of Lincolnshire, Suffolk,, Huntingdonshire, Cambridge farms are practically engaged solely in arable farming, and you down again into parts of Wiltshire and Hampshire where cereals cannot be made to pay, it is impossible.,-   In Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire, we have no grass land of any value.     They keep stock, and if they keep stock in fair condition up to the second week in August, they starve afterwards.THE PRIME MINISTER:   If that is true,   and I take your word for it, there still is no remedy except one of the two I have named.   You see if one were to contemplate the State giving a subsidy to agriculture, there is no end to it.ME. WALKER:     You would admit,   Mr. Prime Minister,    that we are faced with a very serious crisis in the industry?THE PRIME MINISTER:     Yes.
MB. V/AIEBR:   Would It be reasonable in your opinion if I suggested that surely there is a duty devolving upon the Government to deal with, a orisis suoh as that?THE PRI1E MEHISE&amp;R:   But where is it to end?     At the time of the war there was an attempt made, as you know, and. I think that the way agriculture &quot;has been moved from pillar to post&quot; as was quoted by Mr. Bobbins, i3 a very serious thing, but the attempt was given up as quite Impracticable. What are the methods - - - - -MBc WALKER:   Please do not misunderstand me.    I am not suggesting any method.     We have come here this morning and. placed, what are the facts of the crisis before you, and we rather feel it is the duty of the Government, when we, who are involved and. engaged, in the industry have placed, these things before you - to do something.     It is a serious matter.THE PRIME MINISTER:   But the Government cannot deal withthat,MR. WALKER:   So that the Government cannot deal with the crisis that has arisen?THE PRIME MINISTER:   I think that, like every other industry, agriculture must be self-supporting.     That is what I mean.     Of course if you ask me about wages, I think it is a deplorable thing to go back in that respectsMR. &quot;WALKER:&apos;   We are not going back:   we have gone back,THE PRIMS MINISTER:   They are threatening to go furtherback.MR. WALKER:   And the Government, in the light of that information, through you, Sir, feel that they cannot do any-thing whatsoever.THE PRIME MINISTER:   I   do not see anything.MR, DALLAS:   Did it come to your knowledge that in dis-discussion amongst the agricultural labourers hundreds of them and their families are seeking relief from the Poor Law Guardians?IS.
TEE PRIME MINISTER:   Yes, I am aware of that. KE.-DAI1&amp;S:   Men in full employment.THE PRIME MINISTER:   You do not need to say anything to make me realise how serious the position is, hut I do not see any remedy,MR.BEARD:   &quot;/hieh means that that does constitute itself into a subsidy at the present time?THE PRIME MINISTER:    Indirectly, yes,,MR.DUNCAN:   The worst form of subsidy, I should say.THE PRIME MINISTER:   Yes, it takes us back to the period before the reform of the Poor Law *MR.DUNCAN:   Could you say whether there has been any serious consideration given to the question of subsidising in some form the industry as it stands at the present moment?   do not know on what lines any subsidising would take place, but you suggest that there would be no limit to it.   You could limit it.TEE PRIMS MINISTER:   mien once you begin, it means the whole industry, does it not?ME. DUNCAN: That would be largely a question for the farming industry to give you some information on, but there could be some-limit.THE PRIME MINISTER:   I do not see it; if you once begin it, my opinion is yours is much the more serious question but yours   is not the only industry that has come to us with the same complaint.MR.DUNCAN:    The only point about that is that the other industries are showing some signs of improvement; we can see that in the various branches of the Trades Unions -we do know that it is beyond question that there is an im-proyement taking place.   ?e are in touch with 2000 branches up and coivn the country,  and we pan feel that there is an improvement taking pli.ce in industry.   .TEE PRIES MINISTER:   I think that is true.13.
MR.DUNCAN:   It is not as fast as we would like, but it is there, iMR. WALKER:     I want, it to he quite clear that we have submitted our joint case, but we are not committing -ourselves this morning to any particular policy in the statements we have made.   We think at the moment that it is the duty of the Government, faced ?ith the. crisis that you have admitted exists, to tell us if they are prepared to deal with it. We have got your answer, very clear and plain, and very un-satisfactory from our point of view.THE PRIME MINISTER: I realise that,ME, WALKER:   We must take that answer.   We are not pre-pared this morning to offer any policy; we think that is the duty of the Government.IBS PRIME MINISTER:   I quite understand that you should think so, hut we have carefully considered the possibility of that.   We do not think it is possible.MR.WALKER:    To. d o anyth ing?THE. PRIME MINISTER:   Not in that way.MR.WALKER:   We are not suggesting any way,THE PRIME MINISTER:     It does mean a subsidy, does it not?MR.DUNCAN:   It is one of two courses, is it not? &apos;THE PRTMS MINISTER:   Yes. .MR,DUNCAN:    On this side of the table we do&apos; not commit ourselves to any suggestion of policy, but you have explored the situation?THE PRIME MINISTER:   We have.MR.DUNCAN:   And seen whether there are any possibilities in it.MR.DALLAS:   Our position is quite clear on that.   As representing the labour side we are not suggesting any subsidy at all.   We are confining ourselves&apos; to saying that we think a Wages Board should be established.    On the other hand, our employer friends, with whom we are on the best of terms -there is no quarrel between us - are looking at it from the
their point of view, and they think there should be some subsidy; but we are only putting the labour point of viow.   We have not suggested how the money should be found at ail i    If it was desired hy tho Government, we should not be afraid to get down to that.   But we say to the Government that we had a Wages Board onoe upon a time, and it was an immense advan-tago to the workers.   It has gone., and it has loft us in a deplorable condition,   le think it would help the labourers very much indeed if that Wages Board was re-established;.THE PRIME MINISTER;   A Wages Board existed in good times, that is the difference.    I am really very sorry not to be able to givo you a more satisfactory answer, but wo aro doing everything that wo promised to do for the industry.   The roal question is:    Aro we prepared to say that the industry Is to be conducted on an economic basis.    I will say nothing about the advisability of Protection, but is is obvious that it oannot be done until tho country is in. favour of it, but it is not to-day.   I am sure it is not.MR, BOBBINS:   The organising of the industry on a strictly economic basis would involve untold hardship not only upon a large number of farmers but upon a vory much larger number of workers. During the transition period tho distress would probably be appalling.THE PRIME MINISTER:    1 have tried to understand this question as well as I can, and I am incl inod to think that it is an exaggeration to say that the position is getting worse than in pro-war days.   It may bo bad at present, but in the long run I think it will not be so.MR, WALKER:    I wish I could make myself believe you are correct.MR. DUNCAN:    It depends upon how long the &quot;long run&quot; lasts,MR* WALKER:    The employers are quite capable of placing their own case before you,   but I came across a case the other
day - I ,&apos;*ive you this as an illustration - where a man, hiewife and family, when the wages at tho ond of tho week -working a full week - were distributed amongst tho family,it allowed 2%d per moal por head of that family per day.   How oanpeople live or even exist on such a miserable pittance asthat?THE PRIME MINISTER:    I agree.MR, WALKER:    It is in that crisis and that position that wo want to know if tho Government haVo any suggestions to make whereby that position oan bo alleviated in some way.    If you say &quot;No&quot;; I suppose, as Hoad of tho Government, we have to take your answer,THE PRIME MINISTERS    The Government have considered the matter most carefully, and wo do not sos how we can give a subsidy to your industry; that is what it moans,MR, WALKER:    It must be clearly understood that I am not advocating anything,    I have only put forward on bohalf of the workers a certain suggestion,THE PRIME MINISTER:    I have to consider how the suggestion oan be adopted.MR. WALKER: Quito, and if you had submitted proposals to us we should have considered those proposals and perhaps assisted you in every possible way.THE PRIME] MINISTER:    I oan only repeat, I think you must be taking the worst view of the situation.    I have had deputa-tions from other Industries pressing the same thing.   Thore is really no end to it.    They treat the industry in each case as if it could not he self-supporting, and you know tho financial position of the country, how unable it is to moot all these demands.MR, WALKER:    I take it you will agree, Mr. Prime Minister, in the importanco of the industry to tho common weal?THE PRIME MINISTER:    Ice.18 o
ME. WALKER:    I think that it is in the interests of the Nation that food production should be maintained.   We were told by yourself and others that we should never go back, as far as agriculture was concerned, to pre-war conditions, in the interests of the country itself.THE PRIMS MINISTER:    I do not remember saying that.MR, WALKER:    It is convenient to forget sometimes, but at any rate you were associated with individuals at the time who did say that.THE PRIME MINISTER:    I admit that, but it must be admitted from the point of view of those who said that, that they tried to do it and found it impossible.    There really is only one remedy, and that is Protection^MR. W.   HOLMES;    You stated, Mr. Prime Minister,  that the conditions in the  industry were good when we had the Wages Board; but is it not the fact that a Wages Board could at least prevent the chaog that exists in the industry at the present time?   For instance, I find that in my experience in the county of Lincolnshire we have four or five different sets of wages all within a five-mile radius, and in some cases  there is a difference of 6/- or 7/- a week.    If there were some   means of State regulation it would probably help the employer - at least, what one might term the good employer, the person who always wants to pay a decent wage if he possibly can.PRIME MINISTER:    I am afraid  that to press that you would have to come as a deputation lij yourselves,MR. CHARLES DUNCAN:    It is only fair to point out that the Corn Production Act fixed the limit at 25/-.    That is what we are pretty well down to now again; in some cases it is getting less.PRIME MINISTER:       The average is still above that.    It is very low, taking into account the cost of living.
MR. GERMAN:     What Mr. Holmes said might be so quite easily, because you might have a circle of perishes&quot; where one or t,vo might be good mixed farms while the next might be very poor arable.    It is quite easy to get that state of affairs under the conditions I mention.MR. WALKER:     It is a very deplorable condition of affairs.MR. GERMAN:    I agree.PRIMS MINISTER:     I cannot take any part in a dispute that is going on, but I am sure the farmers do not wish the wages to be brought below a subsistence- level.MR. WALKER:     It is being done.PRIME MINISTER:     It is not being dene willingly by the employers I am sure of that.MR. WALKER:     Anyhow we have to try and exist on it.PRIMS MINISTER:    In every business you have to take the good with the bad.   Farmers had a good time during the war. That, no doubt, is taken into account now. I do hope that you are exaggerating what the future condition of the industry will be.   Agriculture is not only bad in this country, but everywhere.   Surely there is a hope that this will be the last year arhen farmers actually lose money.MR. BOBBINS:    The position is aggravated by the fact that not only have wages fallen to a figure which we deplore, but the cost of living has not gone down,in proportion to the lo;rered prices that we have been receiving for our produce.. That aggravates still more the position of the worker.PRIME MINISTER:    I quite see that, and of course I see in your statement,  .rhich I have carefully looked through, that you mention the question of the safeguarding of Industries Act. That does not affect the farmers1 position.   There is really nothing in&apos;that.   If it were&apos; protecting-other industries you would be right, but it is not.
MR. ROBBINS:   Foodstuffs are being imported into this country below the cost of production in the country of origin.PRIME MINISTER;:    I know; but you have to take what the real feeling of the country is.     Supposing we had suggested including agriculture in the Act, the country would not have agreed - at least, that is my view.MR. GERMAN;   You say you hope that next year will be a -better year.     I was one who lived and worked as an agricultural auctioneer all through the &apos;80s and the 190s,.and I was absolutely in touch than-.    I am farming in several parts of England, to-day arable and mixed land, and with this Spring from what I can foresee I look upon this present year as going to be worse than the last.PRIME MINISTER:    It is no good my putting my hope against your opinion, but I had hoped the reverse.MR. GERMAN&apos;:    I hope so also, but the mistake which th.e agriculturists made in the 1 80s and &apos; 90s was that they were always hoping.     I do not see how the farmer can go on to-day. I would not like to encourage him.PRIME MINISTER;    Is it not a fact that, in spite of the bad $position, when farms become vacant they are easily let, evern to-day - ?MR. GERMAN;    I absolutely admit that is the case with regard, to grass farms and mixed farms:   but take the Press and look at the big arable farms - you will find a lot of those to let.     Only the other day I was told by the farmer on an estate I am managing that he could not stop at the present rent although that was only 14/- an acre.     I dare not face the&apos;risk of losing the tenant and re-letting these 600-acre arable farms, so reduced the rent.PRIME MINISTER;     The reason I said that was beoause I have been given figures of farms that have;been to let over the whole country, and they have been taken very readily, which shows that farmers are not so hopeless as you seem to be about the future. I
135 o CrEMAJi:       The same thing existed in the &quot;eighties&quot;. When you have men who have only one trade they stick; to that trade.    They did in the &quot;eighties?     and I think; they are taking the same line now.PRIME MINISTERS     There is a danger of that. I quite agree.MR. WALKER: I take it that so far as the Wages Board suggestion is concerned, the Government cannot entertain the proposal in any shape or form? &apos;PRIME MINISTER:       I am afraid not.   I do not think it is really any use in conditions such as exist today.    I am very sorry I have to give you such a negative answer, hut it is not, if I may say so, a case of breaking any pledges because I thought about all this at the election, and I did not feel that I could give any. If you had any practical proposals on a smaller scale to put,   I would   be very glad to consider them.MR. GERMAN:       I want to refer to the Committee which Sir Theodore Chambers presided over, and of which Sir Erancis Eloud was a member, and congratulate him on the report they drew up; but I would also like to submit to your consideration that the rate of interest should have been put at a lower figure^   Men oan borrow today at less than the Interest  recommended.II do think the Cabinet and the Ministry of Agriculture, in bringing forward their bill, should seriously review the question of interest-.    I believe we are all agreed that the Report is a   first-class Report.PRIME MINISTER.    That will be done of course.SIR ROBERT SANDiJiRS:   Oertainly.MR. ROBBINS:       You are quite right, Mr. *rime Minister, in stating that only two things go to the root of the question.   These other things are palliative s. They will be a   welcome relief to a limited number of people, but you are perfectly right in your diagnosis of the situation.    Only two things go to the heart of the problem.
PRIME MINISTER:   I agree.Do you not agree that atthe moment both are impossible?MR. ROBBIES:I cannot say, I am not in your positionMr. Prime Minister.MR. DALLAS:I hope the Government have not closed the door with reference to the Wages Board.   Just as you are considering and exploring the whole situation with regard to, say, Sir Theodore Chamber&apos;a deport and. the Report that Is coming from the Committee of Enquiry, so we hope that the Wages. Board will also be included in the general review,   The question is surely not closed, while, others remain open.    I do not want you to pledge yourself in any way.PR1MB MINISTER;     I think it is only fair to say that, so far as I understand it now, we cannot   be of any help.The deputation, having thanked the Prime Minister for having received them, withdrew.
