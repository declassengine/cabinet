MR. HERBERT SMITH (President):   Mr. prime Minister, I think we were before you on December 2nd last.   At that tlma wetried to put the position before you as clearly as we could,as to the difficulties we were in on the questions concerned,and at that time you naturally expected that the results would appear more favourable as time went along, and we wentaway with that hope.   Wa had a conference at Southport, andthat conferences impressed our people with the idea that we ought to see what we really could do and give every ohanoefor things to improve.   Since then le have gone through, aa   ,insome people hare said, a booa/trade.   We have got the results;the results are not anything like what we anticipated at thattime, as far aa mine workers are concerned, and wo are hereto-day to put before you the position we are in; and.  to try to Impress upon you and your colleagues toacoept the position that we put before you, because we feelthat wo have carried on hoping for thingB toimprove as1 far as we possibly oan, and we have come to thatconclusion very reluctantly beoause we always realise that if anything can be got by negotiation or round table conferenoeto meet the position, it is better than taking any aotion tooause disaster tar trade; that if anythingof that kind took place, probably the results would only be damaging to trade which has reoently somewhat improved.   Wehave tested the results of our position since July 1921; ithas been a continual grading down of most districts, and theof livingbest districts axe considerably below cosV; and we say to you that we look to you to help us in this position, because we ought to have wages that approximate to the cost of living./A.
As far as agreements are concerned, if the wages hadapproximated to cost of living we should not have been in theposition we are in to-day.   But even in the best districtswe have got as high as we will get.   We did not expect to77 per cent;see the cost of living stopping at we thought it wouldapproximate to a figure which would have meant an advanoe in wages.   The value of money is only what it will purchase, andwe are in the   position really that something must be done,and something must be dene speedily or we shall have to join in saying to our man &quot;We cannot go on as we are&quot;.   Here is an industry that has I think more pitfalls and dangers to-daythan any other industry.   Some of us have experienced.. CChern.With the oost of living as it is, unless the trade sill give better results to the people who are employed in a trade ofthat character, with all its dangers, there is not muchinducement or encouragement to carry on.,.it is not only,wages that we, look, to to meet the cost Of living, .but. you cost ofmust remember that/materials is affected in some districts,-and there are other costs.   We have men in houses which usedto be about .7/6d per week, and now they are paying 18/-,19/-, and even up to 22/- per week, and you just picture asurface worker going hcime with about.36/-.. He has not thededucted &apos;opportunity of paying his own rent.; it is before he gets his money, and he is left with 14/- out of that wage. He is struggling along and applying to the parish for relief and cannot meet his own burdens.   Something really must be done, and we say to you with all seriousness, after due consideration by the Executive and the best intention to carry on, that we cannot carry on any longer in.the state wo are; we have to get some relief.   Mr. Hodges will now address &apos;.. - &apos; g 2.  . - /you.
you,JBgJEJBS HODGES:     Mr sPrime Minister, when no mot you on tho last occasion I believe you thought xio wore unnecessarily gloomy.   We described tho conditions of the industry at that stage, and aftor having deseribod them as faithfully as the data would permit, you agroed with us that tho conditions, in the industry woro horribly bad - to use your own words; hut you said in effect &apos;Wait a little while, and things may improve, and if thoy do not improve botwoon now and the opening of ^Parliament, I will consider whether I can seo you again and. hoar what you have to say further.   Wo are in a position this morning to present you with a statement of facts relating to the condition of the workers in tho industry since Deoember0     The wagos during   January and February have been paid, and I have the information to day as to what will be paid in March and. Aprii0   The joint accountants have been able to get the information out, and we havo It for every districts   Sinco December In eight districts out of the thirteen scheduled in tho Agreement there has been no change whatsoever.     Xn Lancashire and Gho shire;, north Wales, Oumberlandj South Staffordshire and Salop, Bristol, Porost of Doan, Kent and South Wales, wages aro exactly where they were in Decembert and where they havo practically beon since December 19EXo     In tho oaso of Northumberland, Durham, Eastern Area, Radstock and Scotland, there wore movements in wages during the months of Sanaary and February,   In Northumberland, however, it was a movement downwards.   In Durham It was a movement upwards of 4 3/4$ on the standard ratos0 I know that the press in giving the figures relating to tho advances soraetimgs use the phrase of a 4 3/4$ advance in describing tho movement of wagos, but itis
is not 4-f$ advance upon the total earnings of the workmen, hut it is 4-f$ advance upon the standards in the several districts, end in Durham this 4$$ advance was an advance on the standard of   1879.   Ue must therefore ascertain what effect that has Upon the daily wage to get c true ides of what the percentage of advance means upon a standard.   In the case of Durham it meant in the case of the highest paid adult worker a sum of 3.15d per day, and in the case of the lower paid worker 1.97d per day, and for a largo number of those lower paid men who work on the surface and underground, their sub-sistence wage is in excess of the normal contractual standard wage in those districts.   Therefore, this small advance would not affect their wages at all, as the subsistence wage is al-rcedy higher than the standard, plus the local percentage, and they have remained exactly as they were in that county, and similarly in other counties.   In the Eastern ires, which is the biggest area of the coalfield, they ha-d an advance of 2.92$ which was based upon the standard rates of 1911, and in their case it meant an increase for the higher paid adult day worker of 3.15d per day, and in the case of the lower paid day adult worker it amounted to 1.31&amp; per day.     In the case of Hadstock - a Somerset district - there was an advance of lO-fjS, and as this was upon a higher standard, namely, the 1918 standard, a marked improvement was shown ss compared with the other districts where they had en advance,In tho case of 3adstock, the advance amounted to 7.6ld per day.
Ehat is in the case of tho highest paid worker,.   In the case oftho lowest paid worker 5023d per day.   There was a substantialpercentage advance in the caso of Scotland and it Is thisparticular advance that has given rise to a belief that wo were well on our way now to wage prosperity.   In Scotland the percentageadvance for the months of January and February was 14c29 per centoHow 14,29 per cent looks pretty substantial, but it waB paidupon the standard rates of 1088 and thorefore for the best paidworkmen it only amounted to an increase of 60B6d a aay, and inthe case of the lowest paid workman that 14029 par aent gave himan increase of 3o90d par &amp;ay0   Mr0Walsh reminds me that the 1888standard was a standard of 4/-.   The subsistence wage in theseveral districts which I gave you on tho last occasion and which you already know means a wage paid to thn lower paid men in excessof what they would be entitled to under the strict terms of thoagreoment or under the lay wago paid thorn under their collierycontract,   I think I ought to repeat.those subsistence wagesand express them In tho average number of days worked por weekso that wa can got a correct idea as to what those man who havea subsistence wage sarn wookly.   In Northumberland the subsistencewage is 6/9-^d a shift and thoy work on an averago 5ft49 days parwoek which gives tham 37/3d a wosk before stoppages and doductionsat the colliery,,   For Durham it is por shift worked andthey work on an avor&amp;ge 5033 days per wook and they earn 36/ldpar week before deductions at tho colliery,   Lancashire andCheshire      .- get 7/9d per shift worked but thoy only work anaverage of 50E days per woek, by the latest figures, which means that their wage before deduction is 40/3dc   Scotland, havo a.subsistence wage of ?/- per day and they work 5*46 uAys porweek and they earn 38/2d a week.   Uorth Staffs, which Isjsimilar to Lancashire being: in that same area board, .their subsistence wa-.o is 7/Sd.   They work a littlo bettor- time.
time than in Lancashire viz. 5.66 days a week;   hut even so, their weekly wage is 43/lOd before stoppages,   Kent, which has the highest subsistence wage in tho country, namely, 0/-a day, -orlcs 5.37 days por weak and earns 42/11.     South Wales, whore the  . workmen have a spocial allowance fordependents the subsistence wage is 7/2d,   Thoy work 5,76 days por wook and earn 40/lOd.    Whore they havo no dependents, thoir subsistence wage is 6/8d and thoy oarn 38/- a week. I think that gives tho whole of the subsistence wagos, the number of days workod per woek and tho wagos earned by these people whoso wagos are in oxcess of their contract standard under tho agroeraont.     Since wo last mot you the cost of living has movod down one point, and, thorcforo, it can be stated truly that for the vast majority of the men in tho coal trade there has been no improvement whatsoever.     The latest availablo figures for all districts in the country as a whole showing the following average wagos for all workers as compared with pro-war.   In Scotland wo are 37,62 per cont in excess of pro-war;   Northumberland 41.84 per eont; Durham 48 por cont; South Wales and Monmouthshire 39i pw oont;   In the Uastorn Area 52 por oent;   Lancashire and Cheshire 44-J por cent; North Wales 37.3, per cont; Cleveland 55-1 Por oent;   Bristol 65^-4 por cont; Forest of Lean 45.3 per cont;   Somerset 44,3 per cent, and for tho whole of Groat Britain ... 45^ por cent.     That is the increase above the pro-war ratos, with the cost of living now standing at 77 per cent abovo pre-war cost.     The above is tho latest average that we can get under the ascertainment, that is upon the figures of tho month of Kovombor.   As I have Indicated to you already, the movoment has been so small since November - in
fact we havo had to take November and Decombor again todetermine tho wages for March and. Aoril, and wo now know that from the ascertainments when .our accountants are able to give us the actual financial returns for those two months, tho wage increase throughout tho country as compared with 1914 willnot exceed 45-g- per cent0     We are in this position, MrcPrinioMinister, that you know the data,    Thoy are as available to youas thoy are to us, and oven if ono wished to exaggerate,roone would bo promptly pulled up by tho/presaatatives of the Minos-Department, and I have indicated exactly the advances we have had.Bat, on tho other hands there are certain districts whose accumulated deficiencies have grown bigger since wo last met, and in other districts the revenue has beon smaller thus leaving the owners^ under the terms of the agreement, with a lessor share of the surplus proceeds than would bo represented by the 15? per cent,,     Por example, in the case of North Wales the deficiency lias increased from October by nearly  7-g- thousand;       they have  86,000 to pay off before thoy can start to have a surplus available for distribution.    In Cumberland the deficiency has increased by - 15-J thousands     In tho Noisbury district of Somerset it had incroased by  1-^ thousand,.-       It is a small district, it is truQo     In the district of Kent it has increased by nearly  2 l/4 thousand, and in the case of South Staffsc and Salop it has increased by  3 l/3 thousands     So wo have in those five districts an accumulated deficiency which has beon added to since wo last met you0     As I sayt&apos; in the case of North Wales,  86,000;     Cumberland  216,000;   Newbury district of Somerset  19*00:;);     Kent  64,000; and  , South Staffs and Salop  98-1 thousand-,Those
Those arc districts that hava got --or so.   In Lancashire, NorthStaffs, and Cheshire, Bristol and lorest of Dean, the deficienciesaccumulator! up to October have bean reduced since we notyou; but, nevertheless, until this quarter - we are not quite sure about the figures for tho present month    thefollowing deficiencies are acodnulatod against those districts.Lancashire and Iiorth Staffs.  70,600.     I gather from Mr,Walsh this is likely to bo wiped off in thonext two months, but that doosia therenot ;iean any a&amp;vanco in wages, or/likoly to be onofor .i long time to come.   Bristol 1b down by  14,100; Forest of Dean by  8,800.     In the caso of South Wales, where people wore thinking there would have boon a movement because of tho boon in errports - , the actualamount available for distribution as surplus was loss fortho month of January and February than it was in the month of October, which dotcrminod the December wages.   It is estimated that it would take an increase of l/3d a ton on all coal sold even now at this stago in South Wales before a sufficient revenue could be obtained to give tho owners thoir full 17 por oont of the surplus, and that 17 per cent has got to be obtained before thore is a single penny advance above tho mini:, urn in that district.   On a moderate calculation, therefore, knowing the output for December and January which I shall.givo you in a few moments and knowing the prioos obtained for omport coal in these two months, one can say with assurance that thoro will bo no movoment in wages in South Wales until after June of this year.   It wouia be interesting at this stago just to have a look at the orcport side of tho trade, both in volume of orports and prioos since we last met, because I have noa. doubt
doubt whilst I oannot spoak aocurataly as to what was in your mind at that time, Mr0Prime Minister, I am quite sure you had in your mind a possibility of the expansion both in volume of trade and in prieo in tho export districts.   In November we sold as exports G-g- million tons of coal, for whieh wo got&apos;a revenue of  704,millions, or -     2S/7d aton.   That is including coal for bunkers and coal for cargoes, fcOub0 pricos.   In December the quantity wont down from 6-^ millions to 509 millions.   It may bo that that was attributable to the Christmas holidays.    The revenue was 6.6 millions for that amount of coal, but although tho quantity was down, tho price per ton was less than in November; instead of it boing 22/7d as in November, it was down to 22/5d in december,   Tho quantity fell further in January, . the vory latostfigures available   It fell down to 5.6 million tons, with a revenue for that quantity of  6*2 millions, the pricethusremaining exactly tho same, 22/Sd a ton. We/havethree months which represent throo months where there is the highest export quantities, and yot, as compared with the pr&amp;co of precoding months, the change is downwards,,,
v/heri one remembers that the whole of the coal sold in GreatBritain in 1921 was 26/2 and in November of 1922 for I?;0,B,coal alone 22/7 one sees that we are busy and not prosperous,T:.&quot;e have maintained the same number of shifts per week as worebeing worked in November, 5*6;   in fact, the Board of Tradefigures show that there has been no variation, not even adecimal point, in the number of days worked in January ascompared with December and that is the kernel of our difficulty,Y/e have produced maximum outputs since we saw you. OnDecember 16th we produced, in one week 5,7CO,COO tons of ccaland excluding the Christmas holidays and the New Year holidayswe have been producing at the rate of an average of 5,600,000tons a week, regular work, a huge volume of coal, a ready demandfor it, but no revenue, no wages and we have been going on like this since December, 19210   Producing at the rate, as vre are now, 280,000,000of   - tons of coal per annum we still are 32 pointsbelow the cost of living,,   When wo were here last there was a Committee in being which had for its object the study of the progress of price from the pit to the consumer,   I was on that Committee.   The terms of reference of that Committee limited us to a mere study of the factors that made up the price.   We were,       by the terms of reference and by the decision of our Chairman who ruled that the terms of reference did not permit us to study further,        .     excluded from studying the broader aspects of the organisation of the collieries from,the point of view of reducing cost and the bigger questions of the leakages in transport,   m have been able to trace the movement of coal from the pit to the consumer.   v.&apos;e know every element of price that enters in and that Committee came to this conclusion.
:t tn respect of the industry and we have coma to. theconclusion that       cannot, under prca^nt conditions,look fo;.- ft lowering of the average price of coal at the p it&quot;.That Is Page 6.&quot;We are hound to recognise that the present price cannot with the present coat of production give/ an adequate return either to the coal ewnera or to the coal miners&quot;.How, that is the finding of your Committee.   We now know and the, public know all the elements that go to make up the cost of production at the pit.   The consumer has had an-opportunity of knowing&apos;how the variation takes place between the pit price aad hie price.   We have, therefore, ccme to this conclusion, Mr. Prims Minister, that with these facts known the need for an enquiry is rather more limited in character now, that is to say, we don&apos;t want again to enquire into all those elements that make up the cost from the pit to the consumer. We know therru   What we want to have an enquiry upon ia as to whether the wage paid to the workmen in this industry is adequate to their risk, their hazard, and to a proper standard of subsistence, and, if not, how it is to be brought about. That is quite enough for us in any enquiry.   We remember that our neighbours acrosa the Channel, the Belgian miners, have had an agreement which has been in existence now for two and a half years, related exclusively to the coat of living, an agreement that is honoured by the owners and the workmen connlatently.        They have been able to get/revenue
revenue out of the collieries and to pay a wage which is consistent.PRIMS MINISTER:   Their wage is much lower than yours,MR. PRAM,, HODGES:   Bat consistent with the cost of living in belgium,PR1MB MINISTER;   But still taking everything into account it is not so gocd0MR. PRAM HODGES;   The wage expressed in the cost of living in Great Britain is lower than the v/age expressed in the cost of living in any European country,      (Hear,   hear)PR1MB MillSTEP:   But still I think the wages are lower,MR.. PRANK HODGES:   No,   I think upon examination Mr, PrimeMinister you will find that taking into consideration thedepreciated value of the franc - I must say that one must make some allowance for that     the Belgian miners real wage isaccurately expressed in a figure comparable to the cost of -living in Belgium and that is the essential thing.PRIMER MINISTER:   But I think it is a lower standard than yours,so.MR, PRANK, HODGES:    I would not like to say&apos;   My study of foreignconditions, as International Secretary, warrants me inexception of thecoming to the conclusion that with perhaps the/miners of Austria, the British Miners experience the lowest standard of living among European miners at the present moment.   I think that could be testified by examination in a very short time.   I would turn to America8   The American miners had a strike of twenty weeks duration.   It was a strike to maintain their peak wages, the peak wages of 1920.   They were successful.   They maintained them, and they have entered into an agreement in January of this year to/maintain
maintain their peak wages of 1920 fox another year.   They areproducing twelve million tons of ooal a week and they can get a price at the - - pit which enables them to maintain the peakwages, even when the cost of living is falling, for a vdioleyear, and it makes us .. wonder . Even in Germany&apos; weMr.    :british reminds me had this matter thrashed out withthem a little while ago        the mobility of the wage agreement is such that on any day in any ;,iven week by a simple meetingof the owners and the workmen the miners1 v.-.v.ges c n be pushedup so that there is no marked disparity between the wages andthe internal value of the mark,then:e arrive/at this conclusion.   11, viir done \vhat -;.&apos;ehave for our country, having in a sense worked our fingers tothe bone, running the risks and the hazards of our occupationvfhich are reflected apparently in increasing disasters to our people. ^whether,: it Is explosions or cage accidents they seemto have come upon us in greater numbers and with more devastationthan we can remember for a long time unless our minds go back tosuch an explosion as the Sbmhonydd       explosion and in view of&apos;?hat we have done and what we are deing it seems strange to us that the burden of restoring the economic life of GreatsoBritain should have fallen/exclusively upon us.   I igree that thereare some small exceptions but an examination of Appendix E toon Coal Costathis Report of the !iub-Committee/to which I have referred shows that the miner&apos;s wage in    percentage increaseaabove 1914-       /is
278    I);is far below the wage paid, to other workers in other 1industries.   You may he able to show us that the burden has not- fallen so exclusively upon us as we think but we can only go by what we are doing for the country and what the country is doing for us in return.   He, by the very regularity of our employment,    don&apos;t come upon the dole   and are no charge to the State.    Sir Montague Barlow will be able to tell us the contribution that our industry is making, employers and workmen alike, to the Unemployment Pund of this country.   We have reduced our own employment down to 4-g- per cent, and out of our meagre earnings we are paying this huge contribution and drawing nothing from the Government comparatively in return. Vie have done that and yet poverty is allowed to continue.   We made a proposal to the owners which this morning is the burden of our proposal to you.   We -said raise the minimum in the districts. It will be a variable rise in the districts because the percentage above 1914 is already variable but raise the minimum in the several   districts to correspond with the cost of livings   You are aware of the reply of the onners to that point.   They said that they could not afford it.   There was not enough revenue in the industry to pay it and. yet when we compare such a statement as that with the lot of other miners in other countries in the world it seems strange that this industry in our country should be the only one that cannot afford its workpeople a living wage.    In those circumstances then we don&apos;t ask for an enquiry in the sense of going over the old ground of the Sankey Commission.    The data5 the conclusions that followed&apos;from that Oonmission are known. That would be mere repetition.   We donrt want enquiries;    we want to live.(Hear,   hero)
That is the brief claim that we are making and this industry should be looked upon by .the Government in a very special sense. The Government publications a little while ago revealed this astonishing fact,that it was coal that was redressing the balance between exports and imports.   One journal went as far as to say that it was coal that maintained our sterling as high as it is being maintained.   Surely the men who are responsible for doing this ought to have adequate remuneration and I venture to say there is no class of workers in the country who are doing more for the country^ recovery than the minors are.   So to-dayMr, Prime Minister we have to repeat the appeal of the last meeting and we hcpo that during this long interval you will have had time to reflect upon the situation and to have discovered some plan by which these injustices may be redressed,   I will leave it at that.
TEffi IgJOMgjaMSTJR:     I was rather surprised that you asked for an interview because I was under the Impression that when I advised you to wait there would he an improvement, and an improve-ment has oome.     It seems to me that a large part of your factsais based on   -     mistaken theory.   Your agreement must obviouslymean that the riso in wages must lag behind/rise in prices.     Thatis an essential part - it always is in that kind of agreement.in yourThere is, as you know, a boom trade, there are very high prices going now, and they will be reflected lator in&apos;your wages;and it seems to me that your whole case Is based on the assumptionthat ycu are taking the wages &quot;&quot;     based on the low prices that ruled and  ,re not making allowance for the improvement in wage s/ which must coma   - or      Till come later - owing to the high pricesnow going for coal.It has also to be considered that you have        to look upon que s t ion .this/from the point of view of other classes of workers.     It isquite true that the mining trade is a vital one for this country,and. it is very gratifying to see that your total output now is there nre,equal to v/hat it was before the war, and        . I think, more men employed - that is so, is it not? MR. HODGES:   11,000 more . . .THE PRIME MINISTER:     .  . more than before the war.     If you Compare your position with that of the trades where there is still unemployment I do not think there is anything that you can find fault with from the miners1 point of view.     But it seems to me that what you have. .1    to take into account is the improvement which is bound to come.     It is not a case of guessing.     Prices have risen . . .MR. HODGES:     Prices have fallen in January for exports, and that does not come into the ascertainment yet.THE PRIME MINISTER:     They are higher now.MR. HODGES:     Not in February.     You have no data.     The last published data is January,
showTH3 PRIMS MINISTER:     The figures I have got      that theyare all higher, and in many cases they are very much higher&quot;,.and that must reflect upon wages later.     It seems to me thatto make an enquiry now, at a time when trade is booming, wouldbe a foolish proceeding.     It is of course very hard on minerslow .to find that their wages are regulated by/prices .   -forreinstance, in March they are/gulated by November-December.should be        The owners I believe it was your own wish that so.w lih December.proposed that January should have come in/    I think youpreferred otherwise.     That means that the lag is greater.But it is a certainty - it is not a case of guessing - itis a certainty that higher wages will come as the result ofnaturethe present prices.     The  -     of this agreement is that higher wages will follow present prices and surely it would be absurdto ask that we should have an enquiry now.Then I have looked a little into the rates of wagesactually earned now.     I have        here figures supplied bythe Masterrs federation - I do. not know whether you have seen them yet, but they are very striking.     I do not mean that wages now are what we would like to see them - quitethe reverse;   but looking at what is obtaining in ethertrades the figures I am going to give you certainly do not seem to leave ground for any special enquiry.     If you takethe adult workers in the mines, adults, i.e. those of -21 years and upwards, here is the summary that has beenwe you.made.of the   return &apos;     have just handed to  .j.     Taking fulltimers, 81 per cent, of those working full time earn between40/- and 90/-;   or, to jive it more accurately, of the fulltimers 9 per cent, were between 30/- and 40/-, 47 per oent.were between 40/- and 60/-;   34 per cent, between 60/- and90/-, and 9 per cent. 90/- and upwards.     Compared withother trades thesw ere not discouraging figures.17.
MR. HODGES:     They are not higher than the navvy gets. Look at the Government returns in your own Government report.TgB PRIME MINISTER:     Look at the unemployment.where theyMR. HQDGIQSs       But/they work        earn;   we work anddonrt earn.TBS PRIMS MINISTER:     These are livelihood . . . MR. BODGES:     I do not see they are livelihood - no, not at all.THE PRIME MINISTER: .   I think so,     I am only giving them as the rates obtainable now under bad conditions.   But the real strength of the case - and that is why I say I am sur-prised that you have come back again when there is a boomtrade - is that the nature of the agreement must have the effect that the rise in wages lags months behind.     The improvement is bound to come and, surely, it would be wise to wait until that improvement has come.     I do not think I have anything more to say than that.MR. HODGES:     ill I want to say, Mr. Prime Minister, is that the owners may have supplied you with these figures, le do not accept these figures.THE PRIME! MINISTER:     They authorised us to use them and also to give you any facilities - I think that is so - for examination-bf them.MR. HODGES:    I have no doubt they have, but here is Mr.ReportEvan rfilliams, who signed tho .- ..        with me, the Chairman of the Miners1 Association of Great Britain, in which he agrees that the average increase is 42 per cent, over 1914. Are we io have Mr. Evan v/iiliams one day signing a Government document agreeing that the wages are 42 per cent, and the next day sending you in a propaganda document?
TEH! PRIME MINISTER:        These are the average of all the adults working in the mines.MR. HODGES:     All I can say is that I am amazed that with the Mines Department at your disposal, which is in being to obtain correct information for tho Government, you cannot produce this morning data from the Department but must be dependent on the owners.     All the figures that I have given&apos; you this morning aro agreed figures between the     minors and the Department, and the Department would have to acknowledge that the figures I have given are correct.THE BRIM? MINISTER:     It is a propaganda document which you are free to oxamine.MR, HODGES:      Why should the Government acoopt it and hand the figures to us?     If you assume these are right, thenthose aro wrong published in the Governments own document.doTHE. PRIME MINISTER:     I - ;. - not say that,MR. HODGES:     Here are the figures set out in tho schedule to which I made reference giving the full wages of all the miners in the country.THE  RIME MINISTER:     This is the adult wages,MR. HODGES:     tfe are comparing like with like - the average of 1922 with the average of 1913,,are\   TEE PRIME MINISTER:     The adults, three quarters of amillion, and these are real average earnings.MR. HODGES:     How many adults are working at the coal face? employed are and only a third of those/working at the coal face/oan earn highwages.
THE PRIME MINISTER:     Those figures, of course, we have not got out;   they are given us by the Master&apos;s Federation, but, as I say, they give you every facility for examining them.MR. HERBERT SM.ITH:     When you say that the owners givo usleave to examine these, as a matter of fact we are in an agree-in which particular collieries; ment/       wo know nothing about    wo are simply to take whatthey give&apos;us.     You produce a document like this.     It is notcorrect.     I want to deal with you, and if your answer is nothing we know what to do.     We have got to do something.We have carried this thing on, and if you tell us that thismorning, we know what to do;   we don&apos;t want to do it, but weare driven to do it and we shall do it.THE PRIME MINISTER:     I have given tho answer.     It seemsto mo that your agreemont, by its nature, means that the riseoccurred mef-tsin prices has before the coming of wages later ontho rise in pri ;es.     There is bound to be a rise in wages.Surely it is in the nature of every agreement that you shouldwait until that comes to pass.MR. HERBERT SMITH:     When wo talk about the agreement,the agreemont cannot live if it has secrecies about it.    Therehas got to bo open, free discussion in any agreement that has got to live, but I am not talking of that agreement.     Wo aro
ftalking of the position wo are in.     I told you last timo thatdooortain counties could not got anything.     I       not say this because I am delighted, but Yorkshire is in tho position that it control the Lancashire wage rise and selling price.    When you give us this document hare, we have been maoting the-owners and agreeing on figures from time to time on averages that wo have got at tho pit, not from the books, because they would be sent to the accountants and the accountants would ba sworn to secrecy.     If I am going to be a coalowner I want to know what is in the concern,     I do not know what is in it, and I am not going to have it.     I am going to have a fair deal,TH3 KilMB MINISTER:     You are not allowing for tho natural and inevitable lag   in such an agreement to take effect.   It is bound to come and what you have said rather suggests that you do not like the agreemont.     If that is so, should not you take it up with the Masters?MR. HOUGHS;      I said, Mr. Prime Minister, from the known published figures of the Board of Trade, what the price of coal was in January as compared with      November, and I said thatcargotho figures showed 2d a ton reduction on bunkers and .come navecoal.     That has got to      in.     January and February  .to determine the May and June wages, and although you might indicate that there has been a movement in price in February,which, of course, is infoimation not yet available to the   -give mepublic, if you can the districts in which the priceandhas gone up,,&apos; give mo the volume of tonnage that has boen exported, I shall be able to compare tho averaga soiling price f.o.b, in that district-^ith the need of that district for ^n advance in wagos.     South Wales, as I have said, must have at least l/3d a ton on all coal sold, small,large, inland, and. export, before it can give a penny above the minimum.
hereIffiE PRIME MINISTER:     I have - tho latest prices on22nd       Fob. and they show a rise in ovory direction.for mr. HARTSHORN:     There is no advance     ... tha Welsh miners this yoar.THE PRIME MINISTER:     On tho present prices there must be.MR. HARTSHORN:Mr. Hodges has given you tho figures for last month, but taking the last yoar, the profits wore about 5fd a ton.     The owners are entitled to about 2/-a ton on our minimum,,
e cannot        a penny above the minimum until they have &apos;;ot about 2,/- a ton profit.     Aa compared with last year there is about 1/(3d a ton increase in price on every ton of coal whether inland or foreign.      :&apos;e are not going to get an advance in excess of that for a very long time to come, and it is not true to say, as you have said,  that wages rise in-inevitably in response to an increase in price.     There may be an increase in the price in iouth ,&apos;ales without any advance in wages at allVR. HODGES.  Je had a curious case in South   :ales a little while ago. x   There had been an advance in price and there had been an advance in tonnage, but there had been an increase in the price of pit woodland other stores coming from other trades which swallowed up the little advanoe there had&apos;:been in price. So it goes on, and there we sticlc .Thh BjlIMIl ^IMSTiail. You will not sticlc with&apos;the present prices.     The minimum standard in South &quot;/ales is a high one.&apos;. It. HODGES.    Lut the average wages are lower than in the district of Lent.THE PRI?-f3 MINISTER.    They are higher than any other excepting Scotland and lent.    To come really to business, you want an enquiry now into the state of the Coal Trade.   I do not think this is the time for it,R. LODGES     V7e do not want an enquiry into the state of the Coal Trade, but an enquiry as to how it comes about that the miner&apos;s wage is       low in a period of comparative trade pros-peri ty, and what means are to be adopted to brin.c; the wa:&apos;;e up to a subsistence wage.
THE PRIME MINISTER;   The anawer is obvious;   you are taking the time at which the present rato of wages was fixed - &quot;before the improvement in prices had taken place.MR, HODGES:    It is since September 1921, aurely that ia long enough.THE PRIME MINISTER:   The big rise in prices ia this year.MR. STRAKER: Yfe were to have had a substantial advance in wages following the boom owing to the American Strike,THE PRIME MINISTER:   But that did not last,MR, STRAKER:   It was not shown In the figures at all, except Id or 2d a ton,THE PRIME MINISTER:   But the present improvement must bo atownMR, HODGES:   ^fh-Jn the figures are shown in the July ascertainment tha average increase over the present prico will be required to make up the difference between what the owners are getting as thoir share of the? surplus and thair true share,MR, GCK/ERS:   Assuming a rise in price of more than l/6d a ton, that would give an increase.MR. HODGES:   Our real market for our coal is hsre, in this country,   wb may ba a   long way from our stable export trade.   No one can quits describe what our stable sxpori trada of coal ia going to b% but, b-Jliavo mo, it is not going to bs indefinitely upon a price that kespo the workman at a starvation wage.THE PRIME MINISTER:   No, I am sure it ia not, but I sea no ground for thinking that that is going to happen,    hen you wero here last I advised you to wait.   I thought then that thure ware aigns of improvement.   The Improvement has come,MR. HODGES:    I must say I cannot accept that categorical statement,   Ev-?ry figura wa have got shows the contrary,THE PRIME MINISTER:   That there ia no improvement? MR. HODGES:   The improvement we have for December, January and Psbruary has already b-jgun to show signs of going back.   That is indicative of the fact that I gav? you in my earlier remarks that in evary district that had an advance in wag&quot;:a in January and February thore will be a reduction in March and April.THE PRIME MINISTER:   In wages, ys, but that ia going on Past prices,
If you lock at the figures for tie whole industry there is a rise in nearly ev?ry district as compared with last year.   I have the figures h u-e 0   In Scotland it was 9/4, id j it ia now lO/w-^dc   These ar-T the actual earningsB   In ITorthumborland it was 8/4-Jd; ,&amp;t ia now 9/2-fd,   In Durhwu it was 8/ll- d J it ia now s/4d.   In South Wales and Monmouthshire there ia no change, the standard is high.   In Yorkshire, Derby and Nottingham it was 9/5^d; it is now 10/9d*   There ia an Improvement.ME, HODGES:   In contra-d ia tine tion to that, for the months of March and April Scotland will have a reduction cf 1,2.%; Northumberland 3,4$, Durham 3.34$, the eastern, division 4,61$ and Radstock l- $.THE PRIMS MINISTER:   These arc based upon the prices before the rise took placeMR, HODGES:   They arc based upon higher prices than the next ascertainment will be based upon, because the January prices are lower than the December prices.ME. GCffiRS:   They were rather lower.THE PRIME MINISTER:   I was thinking of the February prices,I do not think there ia anything in your trade, as compared withother trades, in view of th* present high prices, which justifiesan enquiry until you see what the effect is.   That is my view .MR, HERBERT SMITH: Do you not realise, Mr.Prime Minister, thoposition in which you are putting uo,   We were here in December and wo ware told if we waited for a certain tim we should gee improvements,    I any that in my district, as in acme other district there is a reduction.   You do not see the necessity for an enquiry. There has been a   proposal made that the minimum wage should be raiaed to approximately the cost of living,   Ig there anything extraordinary about that?IKS PRIME   MINISTER:   That breaks your agreement,- doea it net?MR. HODGES:   It does not follow that the agreement ia broken because there is a consequential alteration^MR, HERBERT SMITH:   We have no subsistence wages   in fchO eastern area, but apart from that, tho minimum wagoo could go before an independent Chairman at any time regardless of thi) agreement,     Wo can do that, out he has got to have2o a
regard to the wages that are being paid.     He should have regard to the approximate cost of living, which is a different proposition.The; Pr-ljne Minister.     That would mean not only a breach of the agreement but a subsidy also? would it not?^ILa^Si?J5-e^t-i^l^S,, Would, it, necessarily? That is what we want to see. I am not seeking subsidies, but even if it didj the servant should be worthy of his hire.Tho^^ime Ministor.     If a trade like the coal trade cannot live without a subsidy - -Mr. Hodges.     It would not involve a subsidy.&apos;Hr, Greenhall,     If it oannot live without a subsidy, it is time something was changed.    On this side of the table we think there should be a fair living wage,toMr, Hodges.     If the minimum wago was raised/ the cost of livingitin the several districts/would be paid and the industry would continue,,     If you shake your head indicative of &quot;no&quot;, why Is it continued in the other countries ifi the world where the miners wages aro at their peak?countries,The Prime Minister.     I have not the figures for otherbut I am sure you are wrong in assuming that the minors in ethercountries are better off than the miners are hero.Mr, Hodges a     I do not assume it.     I state it as a fact,thoughThe Prime Minister.     I dispute it, I have not examined it.Mr, Hodges,,     I have the data at my disposal.other the Prime Minister.     The effect cf the Exchange and all the circumstances: &apos;   haarebecn taken into account,MjKf St raker.     It is not suggested that the American miner is worseo f because of the rate of Exchange.jjne Prime Minister.     The position of the American miner is much more favourable than it is here.M ... Strakor.     That is &apos;a reason why the position of the British*-Aher should be taken into consideration,26.
The Prime Minister,.    But it is taken into consideration.Mr? Strakor.     It is not really, having regard to the existingoonditions in respect to other industries.The^Prjjne Minister.     If you compare the position of your trade with other trades - the ship building and engineering trades -you are very well off,Mr. Hodges.     But we are not.     Is not that the whole point? When a man works on ship building, if he works a couple of days a week he gets for his actual work a rate of wages in excess of what we get when we work.     Cur men sltf not have to have their wages supplemented by a draft from the Exchequer,     What we are doing In effect out of our miserable wages is thisj we are paying into the Exchequer a sum of money which enables other people, when they work, to maintain their high wage and get a Government subsidy when they do not work*27.
THE PRIME SINISTER:   But surely tho difference between employment and aon-employment is very great,MR, HODGES;   We bars some colliers in cur district working four days a week&apos;on the subsistence wage, and they cannot take out of their work more than a man who does no work at ail gets from tho Government unemployment fund,   A married man can gat 22/&apos;* a week at that.   If a man working and hazarding his life in a pit working four days a week can be called better of :f,,,,,THE PRIME MINISTER; Tha increase in shipbuilding rates for fitters and rivettoro on pre-war is approximately-onlyMB. HODGES; The Government in the Coal Costs Report give us for shipbuilding a percentage increase of 42, 51, 43 and 56,SIR M, BARLOW:   TO,en were thua? taken out? .MR. HODGES:   This was published In January 1923, THE PRIME MINISTER:   This f igurss hava been reduced since.MR, HODGES:   You can look all down that list and you cannot see a body of workers there, except the tinplato workers, who are getting anything like our wage,   Dock labourers get 110$. Surely a man who risks his life understand is worth something between 45$ and 110.     In fact we do know that the crossing sweepers of seme of the Municipalities are getting batter wages than skilled collierg,MR, STEPHEN v&apos;ALSH:   That is so.   Take the case of the surface worker in Lancashire and North Staffordshire - each surface worker&apos;s wage is not 7,/9d a day, it ia 6/6d - 15d a day lass than the 7/Sd,     His basic wage is 4/2d a day,THE PRBOS MINISTER:   Hera are the-figures showing the percentage of the profits,    (Handing in tables).MR, HODGES:   Yea, we have those figures.   We know about them, - THE PRIME MINISTER:   You know from them the trade does not allow of big wages.
Mr. Stephen Walsh.     I should like you Mr. Prime Minister to listen to this statement for a moment-.    The&apos; statoment is made that in Lancashire and North Staffordshire there is a subsistence allowance of 7/9d.    It applios only to the underground workers. The highest wage that a surface worker can receive - and there are at least 20,000 of these adult surface workers who are on a basis wage of 4/2d a day.     Upon that there is an allowanoe of 32^&apos; which brings it up to 5/6d0     The highest subsistence allow-ance they can receive in addition to that 5/Qd is l/-.     There? fore, the highest wage of these 20,,000 adult surface workers In Lancashire and North Staffordshire ia 6/6d a day.     When they have pat in all the time they possibly can - they certainly cannot pat in more than 11 days in the fortnight - you will seethat that la 55/9d before deductions aro madea     The deductionsforare at least 8%,    You know the kind of deduction there is contributions. unemployment ;     I ask you to consider whether that person oan be in any sense described as in a positionenabling him to live.     If he has a -family it would pay himbetter to slack off and go upon the dole.Thg^ Prime Minister.     All that comes back to subsistence,Mr, Stephen Walsh.    No, it comes back to what we pleaded forton years ago, namely, the right of every workman to a livingwage.    We were told ten or eleven years ago that that could notbe done.    We were told that the underground worker could not begiven 5/- a day; we were told that the boy could not bo given2/- a day.    Later, however, the people who were telling us thatturned round and said &quot;For the sake of peace we will give you5/^ and 2/-&quot; and later the House of Commons did what was said tobe impossible.     They embodied in an Act of Parliament a condition that every person who was an efficient worker - man or boy -underground should have a living wage; and now Parliament could,if it liked, have regard to the extremely precarious positionoccupied by the workers in and about the mines; it could do now29.
with the samo ease and the same right what it did before, because surely the right of people who are giving honest labour to an industry to proper wages cannot be denied; and there Is no body of people could deny the miner the right of a living wage; and when you have these examples in front of you, we say you can do within the Minimum Wage Act something to enlarge it so as to allow regard to be had to the cost of living in the district so that the miners can have the minimum wage to meet the conditions we have described,,The Prime minister    I am afraid there is no good discussingit further.     In my view the present time Is a time of boomin your trade, and that is not the time to make these statements,and you will agree that the boom in your trade will give you thefollowingbenefit of higher wages . . higher prices.Mr. Stephen Walsh,.    Do you believe that because of the existingboom the benefit will be received by the work people?The Prime^minister    Yes,-I do.Mra Stephen Walsh,,     Supposing a little later wo were to come before you with the later facts and show you that the increase had not materialised, whai then?The Prime. Minister.    If you. like to do that, I am open to agreebut you must give this time to show distinct results0Mra. Hodges.     If you describe this as a boom period when we arejust scraping through to get a penny above the minimum wage, points which Is 85$ below the cost of living - if we have to harass you to get a penny above the minimum in the boom period, what is to become of us when wo are down in the slump? The Prime Minister.    You are leaving out the minimum wage in an employment like yours.MrA Hodges. I am taking into account the element of indifference shown to these million men.Mr, Hartshorn. M.P.     There is real need for something to be done with regard to this&apos; matter, otherwise I assure you we should not30.
be before you presenting this case.The Prime Minister.    I am afraid we cannot go further. Mrti Herbert Smith.    We do not agree with your views, and you are sending us away with a very discouraging impression.   We have to go to our own men arid toll them that in fighting they are going to Jeopardise somebody else and to jeopardise cur-selves.    We have stated, a fair position before you, which we thought would remove your difficulties and enable you to help us, The Prime Minister,     There is a minimum wage. and you must roalise that when coal prices are rising every day it is not the time to come to me,Mr, Herbort Smith,     It will not be more than 50% at its best.If that is so Lancashire and other distriots will suffer.    Weare supposed to have the best area.    We antlcipatedgetting 50%to meet the cost of living, but we are down at 45$ to-day In the Easternarea.The Prime Minister.    We are not prepared to have an enquiry yet.MinimumMr,-. Stephen Walsh.    Not under the /Wage Act?The Prime Minister.     I do not think this is the.time.Mr, Hodges,    You tell us not to pross it when we are down in thedumps, and in the future you would say we are not entitled to it.Wo are taking into account every factor,    We can say asdefinitely as anything we have said this morning that if theprice of coal which you describe is maintained for February andfor March for tho whole of the coal sold f,o,b, in the districtsaffected, that will not bring the wages of the workmen above theminimum,The Prime Minister.    Do you mean if thore is no rise in the home prices?Mr, Hodges,    A riso in the export and home prices in the whole of South Wales,
Mr. Hartshorn.    I do not knott whether you or your advisers are prepared to put a &quot;little bit&quot; on this.    You were talking about the prices which were to come in later on, that tho January and February boom prices will come in for May and June. Have you got gentlemen sitting round the table who will tell you that there is any likelihood of a rise of wages for May and June? - I do .    not know.    I know they would be wrong if they did tell you that.    That would be at a time when six months of this year have gone.The Prime Minister. Does it not moan that you are not prepared: to wait for the improvement of wages?Mr. Hartshornt They have been starving since November 1921 and they are in a very bad state.Mr. Hodges.     It is like asking a man to wait for the hearse to come,The Prime Minister.    It is not as bad as that.
MEoYAEIBY;   Everything that has boon said, MrcPrimo Minister, has centred round exports.   Nothing has boon said about homo and industrials and whatever perceptible increase there was, already the tide has turned,PRIMS MINISTER:   We are not so advised,MRcSOWERS:     I should not havo thought so,MR.VARLEY:     Already the tide has turned in the Eastern Division for small coal the price is receding,,   You are talking about export prices.PRIME MINISTER:    I am sorry, Mr.Smith, but I cannot do anything.MRoHERBERT SMITH:    I am vary sorry, Mrt,Prime Minister, because m ha^z-been waiting for this and. now wo are turned away with nothing. We have nothing to expect5 wo have to save ourselves now,PRIME MINISTER:   you can at least wait and see what pricos do.MRx,;HERBERT SMITH:   We have waited from December until now and wo have a reduction^   That is what we get by waiting.    Then you say, wait on in the face of a reduction^    That is what is happening.   In the Eastern Area it was 49.1$ for January and Eobruary, and we shall go back to 45 for March and Aprll0PRIME MINISTER:    There will not bo a reduction ovor all in March and April even taking the ascertainment pricos as they exist.MRoERANK HODGES:    They will havo a bigger reduction on the larch and April wages than thoy had as advances in January and February,PRIME MINISTER:    But they aro-obtter than they woro in August even then,MR aHERBERT SMITH:   That is the truest word you have spokon; in August it was down to the minimum,MR.:STEPHEN WALSH:   Homo springs eternal in the human broast, PRIME MINISTER: That is the only thing that is left. I am sorry I cannot do anything more,MRoHERBERT SMITH:   We are much obllgod to you for listening to us; at the same time we are very disappointed.(The deputation thon withdrew).10, Downing Street, 27th February, 1923.
