This docnment is the property of Hia Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Copy No.CP. 189(23).THE CABINET.ORGANIZATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE ARMYIN INDIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.The India Office has sent to the War Office a copy of a paper, signed by the Chief of the General Staff in India, and dated 22nd June last, on &quot; The distribution of the Army in India, its preparedness for war ex-India, and for the maintenance of law and order within India.&quot;The covering letter from the Government of India explains that the memorandum should be regarded strictly as a General Staff paper, the conclusions set forth in which have not been formally accepted, in their entirety, by the Commander-in-Chief or by the Government of India.I have read this paper with considerable concern, for it discloses a state of affairs which is profoundly disquieting in the light of the reductions in the military strength in India proposed to us by the Government of India, and I invite the earnest attention of my colleagues to what Sir Claud Jacob says.He states that &quot; the number of troops allotted for internal security purposes are really inadequate&quot; (paragraph 2*) ; that &quot; the size of the Army in India to-day is insufficient to fulfil the two roles which it may be called upon to carry out simultaneously&quot; (paragraph 12*) ; that &quot;its efficiency is seriously affected by shortage of equipment&quot; (paragraph 13*). Further, &quot;the 4th Division could not take the field in less than 150 days after mobilization is ordered&quot; (paragraph 13*) ; and again, &quot;there is no transport for internal security troops&quot; (paragraph 13*).The details of these general shortages are given in Part II of the paper and in the Appendices. I note, in particular, that, if war were to break out to-morrow, &quot; India would have no reserve.&quot; Further, I see that &quot; of the 6 medium batteries, 3 are short of equipment or means of traction,&quot; and &quot; the Engineers are deficient of 50 per cent, of artificers &quot; ; again, &quot; no reliance can be placed on civil transport requisitioned in an emergency &quot; ; and, finally, &quot; any plan that assumes the utilization of the whole of the Field Army M-India is based on a condition which cannot be fulfilled.&quot;With regard to the Reserve of Officers, Sir Claud Jacob observes that the situation is such as to wreck the prospects of obtaining the required reserve (Part IY, C).The state of the Mechanical Transport is said to be unable to stand the strain of active service for three months (Part V).As regards the supply of munitions, the statement is made that &quot; very little organization exists for behind-the-line services&quot; (Part VI, 1) and India&apos;s &quot; capacity for making machine guns is nil &quot; (Part VI, 14).These are merely,a few of the more obvious defects which this paper brings to light. In spite of this situation of the Army in India, the Indian Government, with the concurrence of the Commander-in-Chief, has asked us to agree to the return of 5,000 infantry and of a considerable number of artillery and cavalry. I find it very difficult to reconcile this report of Sir Claud Jacob with the reductions suggested by the Government of India. The discrepancy seems to me to be sufficiently serious to merit the attention of the Cabinet.D.The War Office, 2th April, 1923.SECRET.654* The references are to paragraphs in Part I of the General Staff paper.(b23/1i2)   100   4/23   w.o.p.   772-2
