IJ^ DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE, Third Session, Geneva, 1921. . Proposed, action on Draft Conventions and Recommendations,MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OP LABOUR.ecret On CP, 4117 my predecessor submitted to the cabinet .P.proposals for dealing with, the Draft Conventions and Re-ooinmen-13(23).dations adopted by the Third Session of the International Labour Conference held at Geneva in October-November, 1931. Since those proposals were made, negotiations have taken place between the variouB departments concerned,, and I now desire to make amended proposals in respect of certain of the Draft Conventions.     For convenience, the present memorandum is drafted so as to supersede entirely CP. 4117, the proposals contained in CP. 4117 to which I have nothing to add being incorporated in the present memorandum. 1.      As the Cabinet are aware, the Third Session of the International Labour Conference, established by Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles, adopted in October-November 1921 seven draft conventions and eight recommendations re-lating to the following subjects :-DRAFT CONVENTIONS.,(l) Draft Convention concerning the age for the admission of children to employment in agriculture.(2) Draft Convention concerning the rights of association and combination of agricultural workers,(3) Draft.Convention concerning workmenfs compensation in agriculture;(4) Draft Convention concerning the use of White Lead in painting.(5) Draft Convention concerning the application of the weekly rest day in industrial undertakings..(6) Draft Convention fixing the minimum age for the admission of young persons to employment as trimmers and stokers.(7) Draft Convention concerning the compulsory medical examination of children., and young persons employed at sea
ssocmsasDASions. :(1) recommendation concerning the prevention of unemployment in agriculture,(2) recommendation concerning the protection before and after childbirth of women wage-earners in agriculture.(3) Recommendation concerning night work of women in agriculture.(4) Recommendation concerning night work of children and young persons in agriculture.(5) recommendation concerning the development of technical agricultural education,(6) recommendation concerning the living-in conditions of agricultural workers,(7) Recommendation concerning social insurance in agriculture.[8) Reoommendation concerning the application of the weekly rest day in commercial establishments.The draft Conventions and Recommendations have heenprinted as a Command Paper, No, 1612 of 1S22.2c      Under Article 405 of the treaty of Versailles, the Membersof the international labour Organisation are required to bringthe draft Conventions and Recommendations before their respec-tive competent authorities for legislation or other actionwithin a period of 12 months or at most, a period of eighteen months from the close of the Session of the Conference.     Theperiod of 12 months expired on the 19th loveiaber, 1922, and theperiod of 18 months will therefore expire on the 19th May, 1923,by which date at the latest any necessary action must be taken.3.       It is not necessary to enter into the question as to&quot;whois the competent authority for the purpose of Article 405.It is anticipated that no difficulty in this respect will arise if the course adopted with respect to the draft Conventions andBecommendations of the Washington and Genoa Conferences of 1919and 1320 is followed and a Motion is presented to the House ofCommons, as follows:-&quot;-That this Bouse approves the policy of E,M. Government respecting the several draft Conventions and Becommenda-tions of the International labour Conference at Geneva in 1921&quot;./In
In another memorandum (o,p0 65(23)) I am proposing thatcertain decisions should he taken regarding questions arising outof the Geneva Conference of 1922.     If this course oommended itselfto the Cabinet, those decisions might he debated on the oameoccasion as thoso dealt with in the present memorandum.     the motion might then be amended to&apos;read&quot;That this House approves the policy of Ho M, Government respecting the decisions adopted by the international Labour Conferences at Geneva in 1921 and 1922&quot;.4.     The policy for which I now ask the approval of the cabinet is based mainly on decisions of the Interdepartmental Internationallabour Committee which mot at Montagu House on Tuesday, 27th June,1922, under my Chairmanship, when the draft Conventions andRecommendations of the 1921 Conference were considered in detail.in all cases the proposals now made have been agreed by theDepartments immediately oonoerned.5.     Conventions.     Dealing with the Conventions seriatim^ I make the following proposals :-(l) Draft Convention concerning the age for admission of children^o&apos;li3^ro^3ny&quot;ln&quot;&apos;^yioultu&quot;re -This draft Convention prohibits the employment of children under the age of 14 years during hours fixed for sohool attendance; employment at other times must not be suoh as to prejudice their attendance at sohool.    Exceptions are made in the case of praotical vooational instruction, provided the total annual period of sohool attendance is not reduced.     Work done by children in technical Bchools is also exceptod under certain conditions.   The Government Delegates (Sir Daniel Hall and I) votod for the draft Convention.So far as oonoerus England, legislation which gives effect to the draft Convention is now in foroe, beoause sinoe 1st July, Section 8 (l) of the Education Act, 1918, has oome into operation, further examination of the question sinoo the voting took place has shown that in Sootland, on the other hand, exceptions exist/in
n the case of children between 13 and 14 years of age who have been exempted by the Local Authorities from the obligation to attend schcol, and in a lesser degree in the case of children under 15.     Under existing Scottish law, it is thus within the discretion of the Local Authorities in Scotland, and not of the Executive, as to whether the requirements of the draft Convention shall be observed.   To give complete effect to the draft Convention in Scotland the introduction of new legislation would be necessary and the whole question of the operation of the Education Act in England would be liable to be reopened.     This danger more than outweighs the advantage of introducing such legislation.HSM.Government might, in these circumstances, ratify the Convention, but make a reservation in respect of the position in Scotland.    There are, however, many obvious objections to a policy of ratification with exceptions, and I believe that the late Cabinet were opposed in principle to this method of dealing with the difficulty..I therefore propose that the House of Commons be Informed that the Government are in agreement with the provisions of the draft Convention-, which represents thei existing law in England, and,would be in favour of its ultimate rat ificatlon3 The granting of exemptions from school attendance to children under 14 is in Scotland, however, in the hands of the Local Education Authorities.   The Government are unwilling to adopt the policy of ratification with reservations., and accordingly they cannot ratify the draft Convention as It at present stands.   They, therefore, pro-pose to Invite the International Labour Organisation to consider the possibility of amending the draft Convention so as to provide power to grant such limited exemptions as are operative in Scotland..
(2) Draft QflaT.enti&amp;a^;6oaoer^ag the ^ight^^f^so^atjjn^and oojtglnatiea 6f&quot;&quot;Fgrieultajal wor er8c*This draft Convention is intended to secure to workers engaged in agriculture the same rights of association and com-lunation as axe enjoyed hy industrial workers.   She Government Delegates voted for the draft Convention.A3 existing legislation makes no distinction between agricultural and industrial workers and no new legislation would&apos; be required -        &apos;Ipropose that H/.M. Governmentshould announce their intention to ratify. (3) Drsft Convention concerning \iorkaen&apos;3 Compensation in Agriculture...Members of the International labour Organisation who ratify this draft Convention undertake te extend to agricultural wage-earners their laws and regulations which provide for the compensation of workers for personal injury by accident arising out of or in the course of their employment.   The Government Delegates voted for the draft Convention.The law Officers have been consulted as te the extent and nature of the obligations imposed by this Convention, having regard to the fact that, while the British Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act applies (since 1900) to agricultural wage-earners, it pro-vides compensation only for injuries arising out of and in the course of employment.   They have advised that the Convention merely imposes an obligation to extend to agricultural wage-earners such legislation as does exist for the purpose of work-men&apos; s compensation, but not to modify the conditions on which compensation is payable under the present law./They
They are of opinion, therefore, that our existing legislation satisfies the requirements of the draft Convention and that if the Convention were ratified, no legislative or other action to give effect to it would be necessary on the part of H.M.Government,   ffhey have advised, too, that the undertaking contained in the operative Article would not prevent the adoption of any measure designed merely to adapt the machinery of existing or new legislation to fit the special circum-stancea of occupations other than agriculture.In these circumstances^ I propose that H.M. Government should, announce that they are prepared to ratify the Convention, explaining that the only obligation entailed on tho State by the Convention is to extend its Workmen&apos;3 Compensation Acts to agricultural wage earners ^ a condition which ia already, and has since 190.0 been, fulfilled in this country.^ go legislative or other action to give effect to the Convention will be necessary.I ask authority to make the above announce^ment.
(4) Draft Convention concerning the use,ofjjMte T^gad in Painting.This draft Convention is intended to:-(a) prohibit, with certain exceptions, the use of white lead, or sulphate of lead or other products containing these pigments in the internal painting of buildings.(b) prohibit, with certain exceptions, the employment of males under eighteen years of age and all females in any painting work of an industrial character involving the use of white lead, or sulphate of lead or other products containing these pigments;(c) regulate the use of these pigments by a series of provisions, which prescribe the conditions under which the work shall be done;(d) provide that statistics with regard to lead-poisoning among working painters shall be kept.The provisions in (a) and (b) come into operation on 20th November, 1927, while those in (o) and (d) become operative not later than 1st January, 1924.   The Government Delegates voted for the draft Convention, but on the basis that,.aad in 30 far as, it was an agreed compromise.The Home Office state that legislation will be re-quired should it be decided to ratify the draft Convention and that before any decision on this point is taken, it will be necessary to consider the Beport of the Departmental Committee which has been investigating the use of lead paints in the painting trades.     It is understood that this Eeport will be presented almost immediately and that it will recommend legislation to give effect to the principles of the draft Convention.     Meanwhile a draft oode of Begulations on the lines laid down in the draft Convention ha3 been settled by the Home Office in collaboration with the Employers&apos; and Worker a- Associations concerned and a Bill enabling these/Begulationsr-7-
Eegulations to be put into foroe has been included in the programme of legislation for next Session,Assuming, therefore, that the government are unable to take a decision on ratlfication before the debate. I do not think it Is possible for them to say nore than that the matter is at the moment under _gongj.deration in the light, of the reoommendaticns of the Departmental Committee, and that it is, unfortunately, impossible, therefore, to make any definite statement as to the Government&apos;s proposals for the present. It might be added, however, that the Government hope to be able to announce their intentions definitely at an early date.(5) ffraft Convention concerning the application of the Weekly Rest Bay in Industrial, Undertakings, This draft Convention is intended, subject to certain total or partial exceptions, to secure to workers in Industrial undertakings one day of rest of 24 hours in every period of seven days.With regard to this Convention the position in thiscountry is that a a.tx-day working week is generally observedboth by custom and by agreement in the various-industries andIn no country are the conditions in this respect more favourable.There has been no general demand from employers or workers forGovernment acticn in the matter, and, having regard to the declared policy of the Government that it wishes.to avoid anyunnecessary statutory interference with conditions ofemployment, as already settled between representatives ofemployers and workpeople, I think that it would be highlyinopportune for a suggestion to be made that legislation onthe subject of a weekly rest day is contemplated during thepresent Parliament.   Moreover, when the draft Convention wasadopted the British Government Delegates voted against It becauseinter alia it introduced&quot; a clause providing for compensatoryrest periods.   I still retain my strong objection to the draft a /Convention
2egu.legislation.oria to be put Into foroe has been included in the programme of legislation for next Session,Assuming, therefore, that the Government are unable to take a decision on ratification before the debate. I do not think it is possible for them to say more than that the matter is at the moment undericonsideration in the light of the reoommsndaticns of the Departmental Committee, and that it .1s. unfortunately, Impossible, therefore, to make any definite statement as to the Government&apos;3 proposals for the present. It might be added, however, that the Government hope to be able to announce their intentions definitely at an early date.(5) Braft Convention concerning the application of the , Weekly Best Bay in Industrial Undertakings. This draft Convention is intended, subject to certain total or partial exceptions, to secure to workers in industrial undertakings one day of rest of 24 hours in every period of seven days.With regard to this Convention the position in thiscountry is that a six-day working week is generally observedboth by custom and by agreement in tho various&quot;industries andin no country are the conditions In this respect more favourable.There has been no general demand from employers or workers forGovernment action in the matter, and, having regard to the declared policy of the Government that it wishes to avoid anyunnecessary statutory interference with conditions ofemployment, as already settled between representatives ofemployers and workpeople, I think that it would be highlyInopportune for a suggestion to be made that legislation onthe subject of a weekly rest day is contemplated during thepresent Parliament.   Moreover, when the draft Convention wasadopted tho British Government Delegates voted against it becauseinter alia it introduced&quot; a clause providing for compensatoryrest periods.   I still retain my strong objection to the drafto /Convention
Convention on this ground, as the question of compensatory rest periods is bound to re-open wage difficulties, e.g., on railways.   The definition clause is also highly unsatisfactory. Subject, therefore, to the concurrence of the HomeSecretary, I would propose......to say that, as the Houseknows, it is the declared policy of tho Government that they will avoid any unnecessary statutory interference with conditions of employment as settled between repre-sentatives of employers and workpeople. I should refer to tjje fact that a weekly rest day is generally observed throughout industry In this country, and that in no other country are conditions in this respect more favourable. I should then state that in these circumstances the Government do not propose to ratify this Convention and that they have less hesitation in reaching this decision by reason of tho fact that the Government Delegates made it clear during the discussion on the draft Convention, both in Committee and in the Conference, that the British Government anticipated difficulties if certain clauses were incorporated.   When, in spite of this objection, the clauses were inserted, the Delegates voted against it.(6)   Draft Convention fixing the minimum age for the admission of young persons to employment as trimmers and stokers.(7)   Draft Convention concerning the compulsory medical examina-tion of children and young persons employed at sea.The first of these draft Conventions prohibits the employment of any person under the age of 18 years as trimmer or stoker, while the second makes compulsory, except in urgent cases, the medical examination of all children and young persons under 18 years of age employed on board ship, such medical examination to be repeated at least once a year.   The Gcwrnment Delegates voted for both draft Conventions,-9- /.,
On their merits I am of opinion that both draft Conventions oan be ratified, but that the present moment is inopportune for the provision of the necessary legislation. The Board of Irade report, however, that they hope it may bs possible to introduce legislation during the.session of 19 3, to give effect to these draft Conventions,It is suggested accordingly that E.1L. Government should announce that they are prepared to ratify both draft Conventions and that they hope it may be possible to obtain legislation to give effect thereto during the session of 19S3,Summarising the position as regards the. draft Conventions itwill be seen that I ask Cabinet authority -for ratification of four draft Conventionsrelating respectively to -i. rights of association of agricultural workers;ii. workmenrs compensation in agrioulture;iii. fixing the minimum age,;for the admission of young persons to employment as trimmers and stokers;iv. concerning the compulsory medical examination of children and young persons employed at sea.for the rejection of one draft Convention,      relating to the application of the Weekly Best in industrial undertakings.to reserve a decision on one Draft Conventionrelating to the use of white lead in painting; andto refer hack to the International labour Organisation for amendment one draft Conventionrelating to the age for admission of children to employment in agriculture.(8) Beeommendations.As stated above, eight Beeommendations were adopted at the last Session of the International labour Conference.
The Government are not required to ratify Recommenda-tions; a Recommendation is submitted to the Members forconsideration with a view to effect being given to it by national legislation or otherwise, but It isgenerally accepted that a greater latitude is permissi-ble for Recommendations than in the case of draftConventions.Dealing with the Recommendations seriatim, make the following proposals :-(i)    -Recommendation concerning the prevention rjf Uneiiplbymeht &quot;in &quot;AgrToul ture&quot;.This Recommendation asks Members of the Inter-national Labour Organisation to consider certain measures for providing against Unemployment amongst Agricultural Workers, and to examine particularly the advisability of adopting, e.g., modern technical methods of cultivation; intensified cultivation, schemes of land settlement, schemes for temporary work, supplementary work and creation of Agricultural Workers&apos; Co-operative Societies.     The Government Delegates voted for the Recommendation.There would be no difficulty in accepting the Recommendation to consider each and all of the suggested methods of dealing with unemployment and to report to the International Labour Office any action which it may bo found possible to take.     The preamble to the Recommendation, however, contains the phrase &quot;considering that the draft Conventions and Recommendations concerning unemployment adopted at Washington are in principle applicable to- ii. - /agricultural
agricultural workers&quot;, and the reference thus Indirectly made to unemployment insurance gives rise to a difficulty.As the Cabinet are aware, agriculture is one of the industries excepted from the scope of the various statutory provisions for unemployment insurance, and there la no present intention of extending those measures to cover agriculture.     This was made clear to the Geneva Conference by Sir Daniel Hall, who was Chairman of the Commission concerned in the preparation of the Recommendation.     On the other hand, the Government, on tho strength of existing legislation, and without making any express reservation in favour of agriculture, accepted in 1931 three but  of the four articles of the very general Washington Recommendation of 1919.     Two of the Articles so accepted, (eag,, as to the provision of Employment Exchanges and the co-ordination of public work) are applicable to agriculture, while the third provides that &quot;each Member of the International Labour organisation establish an effective system of Unemployment Insurance.&quot;     In the Conference Sir Daniel Hall referred/to
to those Washington provisions as to unemployment which clearly apply to agriculture and which Great Britain had already accepted:   and said that this -brought agriculture within the ambit of the Washington Kecommendation, but so far as the particu-lar question of insurance against unemployment was concerned, the application of that to agriculture must be considered by each State on its merits.In the circumstances I propose not to accept this Recommendation until it has been made clear that while it may apply in principle to agriculture, it does not apply in detail to the insurance againgt unemployment of agricultural workers.   If the Conference agree that by accepting it H.Mr. Government are not committed to extending to agricultural workers the existing provisions of British law relating to unemployment insuranoe, I see noobjection to ultimate acceptance.   If the Cabinetihonour in this view, I will instruct the government delegates to raise the matter at a future Session6&apos;f the Conference.(Ii Ijkecommenflation concerning the protection he-fore andafter childbirth of women wage-earners in agriculture,&apos;Aus Recommendation asks Members of the InternationaliLabour Organisation to take measures to ensure to women agricul-tural wage-earners protection similar to that provided by the Washington Maternity Convention.   The Government Delegates abstained from voting on this Recommendation.   For reasons already &quot;given in the House and elsewhere, H^M,Government have declined to ratify the Washington Convention and cannot, therefore, accept this Recommendation.
It is suggested accordingly that H* Ih Government should announce that while existing legislation makesjao distinction__between agricultural and indu.str.lal wage--earaers and ensures to women wage-earners a comparable degree of protection, it doos not follow the line of the Washington Djgaft convention or the Hecommendation under reference.___They propose according-ly not to accept tho Reoommendation,(iii) Recommendation concerning night work of women in agriculture. This Recommendation asks Members of the International LabourOrganisation to take steps to regulate the employment of women wage-earners during the night in such a way as to ensure to them a period of cessation of employment compatible with their physical necessitiess and consisting of not less than nine hours which shall if possible be consecutive,     The Government Delegates voted for the Recommendation.The provisions of this Recommendation are oovered substantially by existing custom,     Certain exceptions exist, howovor, which would render legislation necessary to give complete effect to the Recommendation.     Such legislation would be controversial and trouble-some and no demand exists for legislation, and the exceptions are not sufficiently Important to justify its introduction.It is suggested accordingly that H. M. government Should announce that they are prepared to accept the Recommendation, because, subject to a few unimportant except ions, its provisions are already carried out by existing custom,,(iv) Recommendation coneerning-night work of children and young persons in agriculture.This Recommendation consists of two parts, the first dealing with children, the second with young persons.
The first part deals with the employment of children under the age of fourteen years, and recommends that stops he taken to regulate their employment during the night in such a way as to ensure them a period of abstention from work compatible with their physical necessities and con-sisting of not less than ten consecutive hours.The second part contains an analogous provision with respect to the employment of young persons between the ages of fourteen and eighteen years, recommending in this case a period of rest consisting of not less than nine consecutive hours.In view of the difficulty/ referred to below, with regard to the second part, the Government Delegates abstained from voting.No difficulty, however, arises in the case of the first part of the Recommendation dealing with the employment of children under fourteen years of age.     In this case, as in that relating to night work for women in agriculture, existing custom is generally in accord with the provisions of the Recommendation.The second part, dealing with the employment of young persons between the ages of 14 and 18 years, is intended to secure to them a period of rest not less than nine consecutive hours.     Here existing custom, at any rate so far as youths between the ages of 14 and 18 are concerned, is probably not so rigid as the rule laid down in the &apos; Recommendation.     The need for regulation of this kind is not felt in this country, ana acceptance of the Reeorimenlatiori would involve the introduction of legislation for which there is no dem&amp;iifi..
X suggest accordingly that H.M. Government should11 eanounce that they ere prepared to accept this Recom-mendation in so far as it applies to children of either sex or to female young persons.   In view of the diffi-culty referred to in the previous paragraph, they do not propose to accept the Recommendation in so far as it applies to male young persons between 14 and 18 years of age.Recoaimendation concerning, the development of technical agricultural education.Ihis Recommendation provides that each Member of the International Labour Organisation shall endeavour to develop vocational agricultural education and in particular to melee such education evailable to agricultural wage earners on the seme conditions es to other persons engaged in agriculture.The British Delegates voted for this Recommendation.The acceptance of this Recommendation will not involve any additional legislation or expenditure, as it is sufficiently covered by the existing provision for technical agricultural education.   -The second clause of the Recommendation is speci-fically met by Section 3 of the Corn Production Acts (Repeal) Act, 1921, which sets up e fund for promoting agricultural development &quot;including the establishment of scholarships and maintenance grants for the sons and daughters of agricultural workmen and others&quot;,I suggest accordingly that H.M. Government should announce that they propose to accept this Recommendationhaving already made provision along the lines It follows.(vi) Recommendation concerning the living-in conditions of &apos;agricultural workers.This Recommendation asks Members of the International Labour Organisation to take statutory or other measures to regulate the living-in conditions of agricultural workers.
Such measures shall apply to all housing&quot;-aooommod.ation provided by employers, and shall contain provisions regarding the heating of rooms, provision of separate beds, facilities for Insuring personal cleanliness, etc.These provisions could not be accepted In this country without the Introduction of fresh legislation and there is no demand for such legislation.   In view of these difficulties the Government Delegates voted against the Recommendation I propose accordingly that H.M.Government should announce that they do not propose to accept the Re-commen-dation.(vii) Recommendation concerning Social Insurance in Agriculture,This Recommendation requests each Member of the Interne-tional Labour Organisation to extend its laws and regulations establishing systems of Insurance against sickness, invalidity, old age and other similar social risks to agricultural wage earners,,   So far as sickness, Invalidity and old age are concerned, existing legislation is sufficient to enable H.M. Government to accept the Recommendation, but the ambiguity in the phrase &quot;other similar social risks&quot; raises a difficulty, particularly with reference to the extension to agriculture of any fixed legislation bearing on this point.   In view of this difficulty, the British Government Delegates abstained from voting at the Conference,I sugjtesj^accordingly that H.M.Government should armounoe.thAt-in^view of the ambiguity of the jotoase &quot;other similar social risks&quot; they do not propose to accept the Recommendation, making it clear at the same time that^ so far as sickness, invalidity and old age are concerned, existing legislation makes no distinction between agricultural and other workers, and meets the requirements of the Recommendation.
(yiii)   Recommendation.concerning the application of the Weekly Kest in Commercial. BstablAchments .This Recommendation requests each Member of the Interna-tional labour Organisation to take measures to provide thatthe whole- of the staff employed in any commercial establishmentshould enjoy in every period of seven days a period of 24 hoursconsecutive rest.      Members have power to make exceptions.In view of the attitude adopted with regard to the draftConvention relating to the weekly rest in industrial under-takings and the difficulty that the question of Sunday tradingcould not be raised in Parliament without arousing seriouscontroversy, the British Government Delegates abstained from voting on this Recommendation at the Conference.I propose accordingly that H.M. Government should announce that as the question of Sunday trading would arouse serious controversy, no action by the government can be contemplated at present.8.        Summarising the position as regards Beeommendations, I ask Cabinet authority -k*        for the acceptance- of two Bee ommend at ions - viz., those concerning -(l) night work, of women in agriculture; (ii) the development of technical agricultural education.B. for the partial acceptance of one Beeommendation - via.,that concerning night work of children in agriculture, in so far as it applies to children and female young persons.C. for the rejection of four Recommendations - viz., those concerning -(i) the protection before and after childbirth of women wage-earners in agriculture;(ii) the living-in conditions of agricultural workers;(iii) social insurance in agriculture;
(iv) the application of the weekly rest day in commercial establishments,D. for the reference back to the International Labour Organisation of one Recommendation&apos; - via.,that concerning the prevention of unemployment In agriculture.- 9.     For convenience of reference, I attach a tabular state-ment showing the action taken by the Government Delegates at Geneva when the seven draft Conventions and eight Recommenda-tions were put to the vote, and the proposals which I now make in the matter.Initialled   1.1, 3.20th February, 1923.
