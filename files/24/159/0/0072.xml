AGRICULTURAL RATES RELIEF CpMMITTffB,. &amp;3   532RETORT.The Committee were appointed hy the Cabinet on the 14th February, 1923, to examine and report to the Cabinet as to how looal rates in agricultural districts can best be assisted out of the Road Fund,     The Committee have read these terms as qualified by the decision of the Cabinet given at the same time &quot;that such assistance shall not be given until the Rating Bill has become law&quot;.The Committee consider that the question of Scotland should be dealt with separately and a separate Report on the subject by the Secretary for Scotland is appended.It will be recollected that the Cabinet Committee cn Valuation and Rating Reform proposed to embody in the draft Bill a provision that the assessment of agricultural land for rating purposes should be reduced to a general level of 25% of the rateable value, instead of as at present round about 50$ in rural districts and 60$ in urban areas. Such a concession would necessarily entail a reduction in the total assessable value of the areas concerned.     While it is expected that the general revaluation proposed would in many rural areas more than counter-balance the loss in rateable value from.this cause, it was evident that in districts with a high proportion of agricultural land the net result would still be. an increase in the poundage of rates in the districts, and it was therefore desirable to find some means cf giving assistance, at least in these cases and, if possible, in the rural districts generally to allay the opposition from the non-agricultural ratepayers. The Committee accordingly suggested that &quot;the basis onij. /&quot;hi oh 81724.(2,3)
..Which.^oontrlbutione are made toJLocal .Authorities out of the Road Bund should he revised so as to afford a somewhat greater measure of assistance to rural areas than at present in respect of the heavy costs now falling upon them in respect of the highway expenditure&quot;.In proceeding on the assumption that the assistance to rural ratepayers is to he given in conjunction with a scheme of valuation and rating reform., we recognise that considerable difficulties will arise in passing such a measure during the present Session and, moreover, that any Act could not come into full operation for two or three years.     We are, however, impressed by the very strong demand for the relief of the burden of rates on the farmers, and we desire to point out that,  for the same sum of money, greater relief will be assured to this class by coupling the- relief with a reduction in the assessment of the farmers than by giving it to rural districts as a whole on the present basis of rating, when agricultural land will only participate in any relief given to an average extent of zz% of the whole.The Cabinet made it clear on the 15th February that the reference to this Committee intended to apply to the whole scope of the Road Fund finance, and not merely to such future surplus or such exps-nsion of the revenue as might become available.This direction would, of course, cover a complete revision of the basis of distribution of the Road Fund and, particularly, the present basis of grants to the London and the County Boroughs.     Such a revision would no doubt come within the scope of the wider enquiry into the general question of road finance which the Cabinet postponed on the 14-th February for consideration in more favourable circum-stances.     Further, to make any reduction at the present time/In
i min the existing level of assistance given from the Road Fund to London and the County Boroughs would raise acute political Issues and greatly increase the difficulty of -obtaining Parliamentary sanction for the scheme of reform submitted by the Valuation Committee.We have accordingly felt it necessary to restrict our consideration to such balanoe of revenue as is likely to be available in the Road Fund after existing commitments have been met.   With the very short experience so far available of the growth in the revenue of the Fund, it is difficult to form a reliable forecast of future revenuo.     The Ministry of Transport consider that, in the financial year, 1923/24, a sum of  1,000,000 could be made available for the purpose of assisting rural districts in Great Britain, and we are disposed tc think that this estimate might be increased, without serious risk, to  1,500,000.     Reli ance... cn this higher estimate might involve some addition to the amount of cover which tho Treasury have undertaken to give to tho Funds during the next few years,Aa far as present indications go the revenue of the Road Fund seems likely to increase somewhat more rapidly in future than the charges upon it, but it is of course undesirable to pledge the whole balance of tho revenue for any long period ahead.     The rural districts will no-doubt expect any relief given in connection With the Valuation Bill to be of a permanent character but it has to be remembered that the immediate object to be scoured is the reduction of the burden on the farmer.     Other ratepayers in the rural areas have no comparable claim to relief but they will certainly object to any sensible increase in their rate burden.     It le important therefore both from the political point of view, as also to secure that the farmer does in fact get relief when his assessment ia redueed, that the introduction/of
of the scheme should not be attended by an immediate increase of rates in rural areas.     We have accordingly attached more importance to securing that the relief from any scheme of grants is immediate and considerable than that it is permanent.A further point to be borne in mind, if the limited funds available are to be used with the greatest effect, is that the relief should be adjustable to the circumstances of particular districts, in fact that the grants should be greatest where the reduction in the farmers&apos; assessment would entail the greatest increase in the poundage of rates.     This is likely to be secured best under a scheme which permits of the exercise of a wide discretion by the controlling Department.It is expected that the general Rating and Valua-tion Scheme (apart from any scheme with which it may be coupled for the reduction of the farmer&apos;9 assessment) would bring about an all-round increase in rura.1 assessments but that the increase would,  in many districts, be relatively smaller for the farmer&apos;s assessment than for the non-agricultural ratepayers assessment.     There would auto-matically follow in those districts a transfer of rate-burden from the farmer to the non-agricultural ratepayer.      / This burden would be additional to that which would be transferred to him as the consequence of the coming into operation of any scheme for the reduction of the farmer&apos;s assessment. -   Por the first of these additional burdens the non-agricultural ratepayer could not equitably be given any compensation.     Por the second we think he could reason-ably claim some measure of compensation.We have already stated that the general Ratingand Valuation scheme cannot (as we are advised) be broughtfully into operation for two or three years after thepassing cf the necessary legislation.     Meanwhile the/rural
rural ratepayers - farmers and others alike - are claiming to be entitled to an immediate reduction of the rates raised to meet expenditure on rural roads, which has ih-creased rapidly consequent upon the development of motor traffic.     It ia obvious that if, to satisfy this claim (which has recently been supported by a resolution of the House of Commons), the available Road Fund money were paid away before the contemplated reduction of the farmer&apos;s assessment takes effect,- the same money would not also be available to satisfy the claim which the non-agricultural ratepayer would be certain to make, at the appropriate time, for compensation for the rate-burden which would fall to be transferred to him as a result of that reduction of assessment.It seems to us impracticable with the sum now avail-able, to satisfy fully either (i) the claim of the rural rate-payers - agricultural and non-agricultural - for a reduction of the rates required from them to meet expenditure on rural roads or (ii) the claim of the non-agriculture! ratepayer for compensa-tion for the burden which would be transferred to him on a reduction of the farmer&apos;a assessment.If, however, seme relief is to be given to the rural ratepayer at an early date, coupled with some immediate and larger measure of relief to the agricultural ratepayer, it would seem necessary to provide:-.(a) for a reduction in the assessment to 25% of the rateable value on agricultural land as soon as practicable, without waiting for the operation of the general Rating and Valuation reform;(b) to couple this reduction with a scheme for tha allocation out of the Road Fund of the greatest practicable measure of relief to the rural areas, such relief to be given in largest proportion to the most agricultural of the rural, areas, and, amongst thorn, to those having the heaviest total rete-burden and the heaviest rate-burden in respect of highways;   and
(c) to provide that the general Rating and Valuation!)0 ( scheme and the reduction of the farmer1s assess-ment shall he linked together hy means of a garovialon that the reduction of assessment shall come to an end if hy the 31st December, 1925, a general Eating and Valuation Reform Bill has not received the Royal Assent.Proposals have been submitted to us by the Ministry of Transport which will, we think, admit of relief being give in the manner contemplated in (b) above.Itv is suggested that the Ministry of Transport should proceed to consider in each case where there is likely to be an increase in rates how far any hardship to non-agricultural ratepayers resulting from the lowering of the agricultural assessment can te   mitigated.(a) by endeavouring to arrange with the County Councils to place upon the county rate (and thus transfer a portion of the charge from the rural to the urban ratepayers) the cost of classified roads at present borne on the district rate, with the aid of liberal grants from the Road Pund towards putting these roads where necessary into a sound conditions(b) by making similar reconditioning grants for the more important unclassified roads remaining with the District Councils;(c) by continuing the present policy of adding to the mileage of classified roads,  (carrying maintenance grants of 50a or 25%) where traffic considerations justify this course,We recommend that the Treasury, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Transport co-operate in the preparation of a scheme on these lines to be brought into operation as soon as practicable.Signed on behalf of the Committees.Whitehall Gardens. 28th March, 1923.,R A Sanders She chairman,-
AGRICULTURAL   RATES   RBLIZP.Repprt,by the Secretary for Scotland on the Scottish Aspectofthe question.The Scottish side of the problem presents peculiar features which -sill require special consideration.In the first place it has to be noted that the general measures of reform called for in that country will be concerned only with rating.     No amendment of the general valuation system Is proposed as in England.     But as indicated in the Secretary for Scotland&apos;s memorandum (R.T.C.7) of the 22nd January, 1923, the reduction of the rating basis for farms in Scotland will in consequence of the division of the rates between owners and occupiers, and the limitation to the occupiers&apos; rates of the rating relief presently given under the Agricultural Rates (Scotland) Act, 1896, be attended with considerable difficulty, especially if, as seems to be essential, the reduction of the rating basis is extended to the owners half of the ratea.     The grant required in connection with a reform of the kind cannot be placed at&apos;less than from  500,000 to  600,000 which might be partly provided from the limited surplus of\&amp;1,000,000 to  1,500,000 referred to above, and partly by a revision of the basis on which the Roads Fund is now distributed.A difficulty, however, more directly relevant to the remit to this Committee arises in connection with the suggested scheme for giving compensatory relief to rating authorities from the Road Fund for the loss which would be occasioned by the writing down of the rating basis for farms.     In Scotland the greater part of the rates which would be affected by this writing down are levied parochially and the ratio of agricultural to non-agricultural valuation - and consequently the effect of the writing down - would vary from parish to parish.     The road rate, on the other hand, is levied uniformly over the whole of a County District which may contain as many as 10 or even a larger number of parishes.   &apos; Thus, the incidence of any relief from the Road Fund such as   is contemplated will be uniform over the whole 10 or more parishes, although the requirements of the several parishes in reepect of relief may be widely different.It is not easy to see how this difficulty is to be got over if the relief is to come wholly from the Road Fund or, at any rate, is to be wholly devoted to roads.     One method of dealing with the situation would obviously be to associate with the relief from the Road Fund - an increased grant from Exchequer in aid of some important branch of parochial expenditure - e.g., pauper lunacy.     It would require a grant of something like  250,000 to raise the existing Pauper Lunacy Grant to 50$ of the net expenditure as contemplated by the Finance Bill of 1914.     But that is a matter outside the present remit./AnotherA P P E I D I X.
Another ground for considering that relief must be given in Scotland to other purposes than roads, if the rating basis of farms ie cut down - is that there is less scope for applying the suggestions of the Ministry of Transport in that country.     In the first place, the proposal to relieve rural rates by arranging for the County Councils to take over rural district roads - and make them a general County charge - can have no application in Scotland.     Secondly -and even more Important - the proposals to make reconditioning grants for the more important unclassified roads and to continue the present policy of adding to the mileage of classified roads (which would carry maintenance grants of 50$ or 25$) Bust necessarily, having regard to the statistics relating to the administration of the Road Fund in 1921/2, have a more limited . application in Scotland.     These statistics shouW(l)   That in Scotland 32% of ell the roads axe already classified as against 19$ in England:(2)   That the English classified Roado (outside London and the County Boroughs) received an average grant of  209 per mile as against  103 per mile for the corresponding roade in Scotland, - i.e.f that the mileage grant to County Roads in England is on the average double what it is in Scotland. This necessarily means that English Roads must attract a higher proportion of further road grants:I accordingly recommend that in the case of Scotland the Treasury, the Scottish Office and the Ministry of Transport should co-operate in the preparation of a suitable scheme for Scotland having regard to the special circumstances of that country aa above indicated.(Sgd) KOVAR.Scottish Office. 28th March, 1923.
