S DOCmSFI IS TEE PROPERTY OP HIS&apos;BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GO&apos;vermceht!&quot;^V) R S T,COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE,HIRER IAL COiniUKICATIOHS C 01 HUT TEE.IMPERIAL TIRELESS SYSTEM.Remarks by Treasury Representative on I.C.C. Paper NoD686,Ehile I agree in the first sentonoo of the above Memorandum - that tho original idea of an Imperial --&quot;ireloss Chain of Government owned Stations has broken down - I cannot assent to the memorandum as a whole: in fact tho position as stated in that sentence would seem to lead to an entirely different, conclusion, viz;- the revival of the scheme for entrusting the wholo work to a commercial company, of course under conditions to be approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government,, &apos;,Tho arguments In favour of tho present scheme whereby private companies are to bo allowed to erect stations for Empire traffic, and the Government itself is to oroof high power stations, one at onco in England and others later possibly in India and in Singapore, arc stated to bo       (l) that there will be an element of competition between tho Government and the commercial companies which avail themselves of tho permission, (2) that a Government high power station is nocossary (a) for communication with the Navy and the Empire at largo In poaco, during strained relations, and In relatively localized wars, (b) for tho effoctivo training of Navy and Post Office personnel, and the development of wireless inventions in tho Service, (3). that oven with tho competition of private companies,....&apos;.
companies, such Government Stations would obtain considerable revenue by means, possibly, of a geographical division of the spheres of influence of the Government stations and the private companies respectively, taking the form of an arrangement with the competing companies, (4) that an immediate start with some form of Imperial Fireless Commission is necessary.

To these arguments it may be replied that the element of competition to which value is now attached was, ex hypothesi, absent as long as the proposal to have a Government monopoly held the field: that, even under tho present scheme, competition (if an Arrangement is arrived at) will be absent; and that, if an Arrangement is at all possible with a commercial company, such an Arrangement might be made, in return for the remission of restrictions, that all the advantages claimed for a Government system could be obtained, e.g.

(a) Special terms for, or free Government communications in peace time.

(b) Priority in times of strained relations or localized wars (as we11 of course as complete power to Government to take over if necessary).

(c) Special facilities for admission of service personnel for training at the Company&apos;s stations.

(d) Establishment of an Inventions Board containing representatives of the Government and of the Company, whose duty it would be to enquire into all inventions. It might be a condition of the Arrangement that any inventions approved by the Board should be tried by the Company unless they could show cause against doing so.

The memorandum does not set out the cost of the combined system proposed. It is assumed, however, that there will be, now or in the near future, the capital expenditure estimated by the Committee of 19th May, 1922, viz:-
English Station £ 223,000

(possibly) Indian Station £ 185,000

(later) Singapore Station £ 185,000

£ 593,000

Subject, in the case of Singapore, to a possible contribution from the Colony.

The same Committee estimated annual charges for the three stations at £183,000, and an annual revenue for the next five years of £ 164,000.

It would seem probable that, while the immediate capital charge under tho proposed system would be not less than the above estimate of £ 223,000 for the English station, for which the annual charges were put at £ 64,000, the estimated immediate revenue must be considerably reduced by the amount of the private Company&apos;s traffic. It is not stated whether, if the Marconi Company is admitted to compete, not only with His Majesty&apos;s Government, but with other Companies, on the terms proposed, the Company&apos;s Patent claims are expected to lapse. If they are admitted, a further considerable outlay must be reckoned with; and if that Company refuses to come into an Arrangement which involves theld? of these claims, and if no other Company is likely to take advantage of the general permission to private companies, the element of competition, to which importance is attached, disappears.

It would seem, therefore, as if, now that the original idea of an Imperial Fireless Chain has broken down, and if Imperial communication could be obtained, without capital or annual expenditure, an Arrangement with the Marconi Company would give all the advantages hoped for by the present Scheme.

Judging....
Judging by tho delays which have attondod the full Government Scheme, it would soon that tho imnc&amp;iate inception Of a privately cwnod scheno Is at least just as likely as of any Government action.It is suggested, therefore, that negotiations should bo at onco opened with tho Company for the. conclusion of an Arrangement on some such conditions as indicated abovoa It should, ho added that the Sorvico Departments were in 1920 not adverse in principle to a Private Company Scheno (r&apos;ar Office cab,gpapor 1031: Air Ministry cab. paper 1213:secretAdmiralty &quot; ) I
