[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government] /&quot;   473Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1923.SECRET.loCP. 159 (23). CABINET.SPECIAL REPORT ON  UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 87.    Period ended March 9, 1923.SUMMARY OP UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION.The number of persons registered at the Employment Exchanges as wholly unemployed at the 5th March was 1,318,955, a decrease of 9,099 on the previous week.POSITION IN CHIEF INDUSTRIES.COAL-MINING.The improvement in the Forest of Dean has been maintained. The situation in the Durham and South Yorkshire coalfields is almost normal, and prospects are encouraging. In Lancashire, employment continues to be satisfactory. The general improvement in Scotland continues, and prospects are bright. In the Midlands, employment is good, full-time being worked in most districts. Employ-ment is fairly steady in Wales, but congestion at the docks has adversely affected production.IRON AND STEEL.The slow improvement in the Midlands continues, but its effect is not general, owing to the unsettled state of the market. In Yorkshire and the North of England there are signs of improvement, but activity is still below the normal level. In Lancashire, increased activity has occurred in certain areas, consequent upon the removal of the difficulties previously created by the shortage of coke. The situation in Scotland is not very settled. In North Wales the improvement has been maintained, but the position in South Wales has not materially improved.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.The Avonmouth ship-repairing yards continue to be busy. Trade is very slack at Cowes, and there is little activity in the repairing yards at Portsmouth and Southampton. On the Tyne and Tees, a small increase in activity has occurred, and there are indications that the improvement will be maintained. Conditions are improving slightly on the Mersey and at Barrow, but in Scotland the industry generally is depressed, although it is difficult to forecast probable developments. In North Wales the depression continues, and in South Wales unemployment has increased.ENGINEERING.Isolated improvements continue at some centres, and men are slowly being re-engaged, but unemployment generally remains below the normal level.TEXTILES.Cotton.-In Lancashire there is no marked change in the situation, but extended stoppages of workpeople are reported to be more general. In Yorkshire, unemployment is a little worse, and immediate prospects are not encouraging.
Hosiery, Woollen and Worsted.-The hosiery trade in the Midlands is now almost normal, but a slight setback has, however, occurred in one or two centres owing to a shortage of yarn. In Yorkshire there has been no marked fluctuation, and the prospects are uncertain. In Scotland the situation has undergone no change.Silk. In the Midlands, employment continues below the normal level. There is, however, some activity in the manufacture of artificial silk at Derby. Prospects at other centres are fair.Lace. The depression in the Midlands continues, especially in the levers section, but the plain net and curtain sections have experienced a slight improvement.Jute A dispute which originated with the spinners is in progress in Scotland. Disaffection has spread, and upwards of 10,000 operatives are idle. Unless a satisfactory settlement is reached soon, the prospects of the recovery of trade will be seriously jeopardised.BUILDING.While there is evidence of improvement in some places, it is difficult to estimate the precise position of employment in this industry owing to the delay in obtaining a satisfactory settlement of the negotiations between employers and operatives on the question of wages and hours. In Scotland and the Home Counties, disputes have arisen owing to a reduction of wages, and generally it is felt that orders are being suspended pending a more settled condition of the industry.BOOT AND SHOE.A slight improvement is reported at Norwich and at Kingswood. In the Midlands, trade is below the normal level with, however, some tendency towards improvement. In particular, trade is good at Stafford and Worcester, and some improvement has occurred at Leicester. Short-time working continues at Kettering, but there is a slight improvement in employment among women operatives at Wellingborough.   There is no sign of improvement in Scotland.CLOTHING.In the South-Western and Home Counties some activity is evident in wholesale tailoring and dressmaking, and improvement is reported from the Midlands.POTTERY AND GLASS.In the Midlands, the revision of wages and the possibility of a trade dispute in the pottery industry are holding up orders, but in most centres trade continues to be steady. A slight revival in the glass-bottle trade is reported in Yorkshire and Durham.TINPLATE.Employment continues to be good. Production is maintained, and there is a good market for plates and sheets.TRANSPORT.Trade is quiet at the London Docks, and there has been a decrease in shipments, &amp;c, at the Welsh Docks. An improvement has occurred at Bridgewater, but considerable unemployment exists at Southampton and Weymouth. On the North-East Coast, unemployment among dockers is heavy, but a temporary improvement has arisen as a result of the increased export of coal and iron to the Continent.   Trade at the Liverpool Docks is improving slowly.C. A. MONTAGUE BARLOW, Ministry of Labour.
I. DETAILED UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES.1. General Percentage of Unemployment.[Note.-Down to November 1920 the only percentages of&quot;unemployment available are those, derived from Trade Onion returns covering roughly 1,000,000 workers.

[From Autumn 1920 onwards.] Cabinet Unemployment Committee,The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, the then Cabinet appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment. This Committee continued to function till October 1922. The present Government appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee on the 1st November, 1922.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the 8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit, extended the periods of benefit and increased the contributions. As from November 1921 the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision for grants in respect of wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed a special levy to provide for these grants. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, which operates as from the 6th April, 1922, amalgamates the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment Insurance

Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Report. At least 300,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 140,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits Scheme.(C.) Recent Extensions of Remedial Measures.Some of the&apos;measures comprised in (B) above are still in operation, e.g., past sanctions of grants by the Unemployed Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport. The Export Credits Scheme continues, and schemes approved under the Trade Facilities Act are in progress.In June 1922, the Unemployment Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport issued circular letters to Local Authorities inviting them -to submit schemes for works of public utility, which, with assistance from State funds, might be undertaken for the relief of unemployment in their respective areas. ApProved schemes are assisted by grants made on the same bases as heretofore. In the case of schemes assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee, particulars of grants already sanctioned are set out below.In September 1922, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries issued circular letters to County Councils (except&apos; the London County Council) and Drainage Authorities, inviting them to submit schemes of land drainage which, if approved, might be assisted on fundamentally the same conditions as1 those applicable in the [970-J] f. 3contributions, and extends until June 1923 the special periods during which &quot; uncovenanted &quot; benefit may be drawn. The authority to borrow monev from the Treasury is increased to  30,000,000.
case of schemes assisted last year. All applications were to be received in the case of . Drainage Authorities on or before December 1, 1922, and in the case . of: County Councils (Agricultural Committees) on or before December 16, 1922. lit County Councils were also circulated with regard to schemes for the supply of water to farms, the conditions of assistance from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries remaining substantially the same as last winter, with the exception that the Ministry, instead of advancing&apos; the whole cost ot any scheme and recovering a proportion from the owners concerned, will make grants to cover part only of the total cost of each scheme. Further circulars, issued to County Councils and Drainage Authorities on the 5th and 6th December respectively, notified the extension of the date up to which applications might be received to the 13th January, 1923, and invited the submission of additional schemes. The time for receiving applications was further extended provisionally to the 10th February, 1923. Particulars of grants sanctioned and of the number of men employed to date are shown below (see table 6).On the 30th November, 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, outlined the manner in which measures taken by the late Government wouldbe continued and extended. The additional sums promised in extension of existing funds are set out below :  Unemployment Grants Committee (for grants on the basis of60 per cent, of Wages Bill) ...         ...         ...         ... 600,000Land Drainage          ...         ...         ...         ...         ... 170,000Afforestation ...         ....        ...        ...         ...         ... 100,000Acceleration of Government contracts-Office of Works-   ... ...        ... 375,000General Post Office ...        ... 94.6,0001,321,000It was also then announced that guarantees under the Trade Facilities Act Scheme would be made available up to  50,000,000 ( 25,000,000 extra); that the Export Credits Scheme would be extended if necessary; and that the Local Authorities concerned would be asked to co-operate in putting in hand the Manchester-Liverpool Road, which would involve an expenditure of about  3,000,000, half of it from the Road Fund.In December 1922, the Unemployment Grants Committee issued a further circular letter to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes suitable for assistance on the basis of 60 per cent, of the Wages Bill, i.e., works the cost of which is normally defrayed out of revenue and not by loan. The conditions under which grants may be sanctioned are substantially the same as those previously in force, except that in the case of Rural Districts the Committee have discretion to allow, where clearly necessary, a modification of the conditions regarding the giving of preference to 75 per cent, ex-service men and the engagement of labour through the Employment Exchanges.On the 12th December, 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, further announced that, in addition to the acceleration of contracts by the Post Office and Office of Works, previously described, the-Admiralty would accelerate miscellaneous works to a total of about  365,000; whilst the Home Office would puE in hand certain accelerated building work, together with repairs to buildings, including Police Stations.On the 13th December, .1922, the Forestry Commission issued a press notice to the effect that forestry grants were available for the relief of unemployment on the same general conditions as those applicable to grants made last winter. The sum of  100,000 referred to above is to be used partly for this purpose and. partly for the purpose of relief schemes in Crown Forests and for additional work in the Commission^ forests by the Trade Facilities and Loans Guarantee Act, 1922 (Session 2), enacted on the 15th December, 1922, formal sanction was given for the increase of the aggregate capital amount of loans the principal or interest of which mav be guaranteed under the Trade Facilities Act, 1921, from  25,000,000 to  50,000,000.On the 15th February, 1923, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, announced an extension of  5,600,000 in the amount available for grants in respect of approved road works by the Ministry of Transport./
