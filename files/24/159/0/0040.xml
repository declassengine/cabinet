Under tho 3t&apos;r,tv,fco&apos;ry provisions governing the oon-stltution of sEKvU-holdiaga in Scotland a very considerable measure of security of tenure is given to the small holders. These holdings, however, may be resumed by the owners on certain specified grounds.     One of these grounds is resumption for personal occupation by an owner who possesses no landed estate other than the holding to be resumed.3. Until recently this power of resumption was veryrarely exercised and caused no troublej but within the last year or eighteen months there have been some cases and they may become more numerous x/aere . ow:.&apos;.ng to the breaking up of estates,  small holdings have been sold as separate subjects at prices beyond the reach of the occupiers, and the purchasers have exercised their statutory rights of resumption for personal occupation, with the result that the occupiers have been evicted.     This has given rise to serious complaints and has, it is alleged, produced a general feeling of insecurity amongst the classes affected.   Moreover, in a certain proportion of such cases the purchase has been made rather to secure a residence than to engage in the active cultivation of the holding, and to this extent holdings, which have been created at considerable expense to the State, are being diverted from the purpose for which they were created.The fact is that the crofter tenure, which was extended to the non-crofting parts of Scotland by the Small &apos; Landholders (Scotland) Act, 1911, is based upon the assumption that the holding forms part of a larger restate, and it is hardly an exaggeration to say that the breaking up of estates, the disappearance of Landlord, Pactor, and Estates Management, bid fair to knock the bottom cut of the crofter system, at arc-rate in districts where small holdings are saleable as separate entities.Various methods have been suggested to deal vri.th.the situation.     It has been proposed that the right to resume for personal occupation should be taken away, but the effect of this wo-tld be to render small holdings unsaleable except as continuing portions of a larger estate, for no one is likelyto/
to purchase a sing?,e small holding merely as an investment. Another suggestion is that in the event of a sale the occupier of. a small holding should have, tho right of pre-emption at a price to be fixed by the Land Court.       This would be a fair solution, and a feasible one, ware it not for the inevitable corellary that the Government should advance loans to enable occupiers to effect purchases.     Without this, the remedy would be illusory, and the demand for Government assistance is therefore put forward as an(essential condition by those who suggest pre-emption, by itself;, as a means of meeting the diffieulty.     It is, however, along these lines that I think a solution should be sought and an escape from the heavy expenditure incurred under the Small Land-holders Acts.    In my judgment an opportunity has arisen to move from occupying tenancy towards a system of occupying ownership, a system which has proved its stability, economy, and finality, all the world over.6* Accordingly I suggest that legislation should be passed which would in the event of sale give to the occupier a right of pre-emption or, alternatively, the right to acquire hi8 holding on a feu, the price, or the amount of the feu-dvtj, as the case may be, &quot;to be fixed, failing agreement, by the Land Court.This alternative method would obviate the olaim for Government loans, and would give the seller either cash or a feu-duty which would be saleable.     Incidentally., it would relieve the landowner of burcens of management, and, what would probably be even more important from his point of view, would relieve him, too, of the contingent liability to corn-pens ate outgoing snail holders for the value of improvements, which, in most cases, comprise the whole equipment of the holding.(Sd..)   1VOVAR.Soottish Office,Whitehall,    S.W. 1.6th March, 1933.
