HOUSING   BILL. gA. General Scheme of the Bill. 1. The principal objects of this. Bill are.:-(a) To get rid of the unlimited liability of the State for all losses exceeding the produce of Id. rate on housing schemes and slum improvement schemes carried out by Local Authorities, which is imposed by the Housing, Town Planning,. &amp;o , Act 1919.(b) To enable the State for a limited period to assist the provision of working class houeea of smalltype by private enterprise or by Local Authorities, by means of a grant of a fixed annual subsidy per house for a term of years, paid through the Local Authorities,(cl To encourage the building of other working class houses by enabling the Local Authorities to provide credit facilities for builders.(d) To make simplifications.in the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.1899 (which was designed to encourage owner.-occupiership) with a view to extending the operations under tt a t Ac t..(e) As regards slum improvement schemes to riake statutory provision for the administration of the grant, not exceeding  200,000 a year which has been promised by the Government towards the annual losses Incurred by Local. Authorities in carrying out such schemes, This limited annual State contribution will supersede the liability, to which the State was subject vixdor the Act of 1919, for all losses on slum, improvement schemes where Local Authorities were already committed to expenditure&apos; on Housing schemes under that Act involving a charge equivalent to a Id. rate./As
As regards the subsidies for house building the general intention is that these should apply only to houses of the smallest type, being the houses which&quot;unaided private enterprise is not likely to undertake for some time to ooireand that the subsidies shall only be available for houses built within the period up to the termination ofthe Rent Restriction Act.The subsidy will be adjusted so that It amounts approximately to one half the estimated annual loss on such houses equated over a period of say 20 years.    The figure is still being, negotiated with the local authorities.     The State contribution will be the same whether the houses are built by private enterprise or by the Local Authoritiesand the Local Authorities will have full financial responsibility for any loss in excess of the State grant on houses built by themselves and for payments made to private builders In excess of the Stat6 contribution,     While the State grant will be available on the - same basis for houses built by private enterprise or.by the Local Authorities It is intended that Local Authorities should make buildings by private enterprise tiie .first line of attack.In addition to the principal objects outlined above the Bill contains a number of provisions for removing difficulties and simplifying procedure in. connection with house building and dealing with slums and unsatisfactory houses.     The proposals for getting rid of obsolete bye-laws and modifying bye-laws as to streets so as to assist estate development may be specially mentioned.13. Clauses of the. BilJU 2. Clause^JUThe general intention of this clause providing for Government subsidy has already been described.Sub-Clause 1./
Sub-Clause 1.     The conditions to be made by the Minister will comprise maximum and minimum sizes of houses to which grant will apply, minimum specification and machinery in connection with the grant, e.g,, audit,Sub--clause 2.     The grant for slums is intended to be administered on the basis of securing a contribution from the local authority at least equivalent to the State contribution.     In connection with any scheme an estimate will be made of the average annual loss. The stated maximum annual contribution will be fixed at one-half this estimate^Sub^Clause 5,,     This is to provide that local authorities and pirivate persons shall not be damnified by reason of having proceeded in anticipation of the passing of the Act.Subr-Clause 5,     Repeals the liability of the State (a) to contribute to losses of local authorities in excess of Id. rate, (b) to make grants of parts of the charges on loans raised by public Utility Societies or by County Councils for housing their employees. The position as regards anything already done under the sections governing these matters Is safeguarded.. 3&apos;     Clauqe S,Thi3 clause applies to houses built by private enterprise to which the Exchequer Grant will be applicable.Local authorities may adopt any or all of the following methods:-,   (a) Make capital grants to builders. The authorities are empowered to borrow to provide the funds for these grants.     The State annual contribution vfill be available to meet part of the annual charge on the loans raised for this purpose.- (b)/
(b)   Make an allowance for a limited period to the person paying the rates on an assisted house by way of 56refund of the whole or some part of the rates on the house. This enables the local authority if they so desire to grant assistance by annual payments instead of capital payment. The method adopted attaches the payment to the house,(o)   Undertake to pay the loan charges on part of an advance made by a building society. Sub-Clause 5   is designed to prevent abuses arising through a person obtaining a capital grant for a house complying with the conditions and then converting the house into one of a different kind.     The clause provides that for a period of five years there shall be no addition to or enlargement of the house except with the consent of the local authority.,     f-,hB period cf five years is an arbitrary one * It ia desirable or. the one hand to prevent any change in the character of the hou.se while shortage continues and on the ether hand to avoid hedging houses round with restrictions which will make private enterprise unwilling to embark on building.     As regards houses for which local authorities make rate allowances or payments to. building societies, the authorities will make the continuance of these annual payments subject to similar conditions.4,     Clause 3,This Clause Is to enable the Minister to exercise a discretion as to the payment of subsidy on a house which for sufficient reason is not completed within the specified time.5.     Clause 4.This Clause enables a local authority to lend money to persons proposing to build houses or to guarantee part of the repayment of loans advanced by building societies.     The exercise of this power involves no State subsidy.     It Is Intended for use in regard to houses of a larger type, though it can also be used in regard to the smaller Ant-e-subsidised houses,p ow ar/
Power is given to lend during construction but in that case the local authority-may not lend more than 50$ of the value of the work done at the time of the advance.Aa regards the building society proposals it is anticipated that local authorities may arrange to guarantee an advance lent by a society (in so far as the advance exceeds what the Society would ordinarily lend) until the loan is reduced to the normal amount.This provision like the one in Clause 3 is a temporary one.6. Clause 5.Under Section 15(d) of the Housing Act, .1919 a house built by a local authority if sold must be subject to the condition that it cannot be used by the owner for housing a person in his employment:   the section aims at preventing the houses becoming tied houses.Under Section 15(2) where houses or land, for the erection Of houses are 30ld by a local authority,  the authority must make various conditions, the chief of which is that they must limit the amount of rent to be charged for the houses sold or built on the land disposed of.These conditions militate -seriously against sales and  it is proposed to repeal the subsections.    Phis was recommended by the Geddes Committee and a similar provision was included, in the Economy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.7* 0la-use 6. . This clause is proposed mainly to meet a difficulty which is met with in connection with London County Council schemes.,   . In/
In the ordinary cage where a local authority carries out an approved housing scheme within its own area, any roads constructed become highways repairable by the inhabitants at large and are maintained by the highway authorities.   The London County Council has carried out- some housing schemes in the area of Metropolitan Boroughs (for which the borough is the highway authority) and some outside the county.   In 30me cases the highway authorities have raised difficulties about taking roads over.    The clause will put these roads In the same position as if they had been made in connection with a housing scheme carried out by the local authority in whose district they are.Sub-clause 2 is to meet some case3 where the London County Council have carried out housing schemes which have been fully approved by the Minister, but the local authority in whose district the bouses are situate refuse to Issue habitation certificates because the urban district council do not consider that the houses comply in&quot;a 11 respects with the local: bye laws.8. Clause 7.     This 3s a clause proposed by the L.C.C.. arising out of their experience in dealing with slum areas and is designed to secure co-operation   between the Council and the licencing justices.    The local authority are empower-ed to contribute towards any amount payable.as compensation on the refusal of the renewal of the licence and the compensation authority are empowered to contribute out of the compensation fund towards- compensation&apos; in respect of &apos; the acquisition by the local authority of licensed premises,9., Clause Be/
9a     Clause 8.     This is a consolidating and simplify-ing proposal.     Part I of the Housing Act 1890 deals with schemes for the improvement of unhealthy areas and Is intended generally to deal with areas of considerable size. Part II of that Act deals with unsatisfactory houses includ-ing aggregations of houses which in fact may bo undistinguish-able from the Unhealthy Areas to which Part I relates. There are a considerable number of minor differences in procedure and in connection with assessment of compensation which rest on no logical basis and merely serve to produce confusion.    This state of things arises because the Act of 1890 was a rough kind of consolidating measure; Part I was taksn from one set of old Acts and Part II from anothero     It Is proposed by this clause to assimilate the procedure etc. under both parts to that relating to Part I.In Lord on the County Council Is the sola authority for Part I schemes:   there is a concurrent jurisdiction for Part II schemes (except in the case of very small schemes) though the County Council may contribute to a Part II scheme carried out by a Borough Council and vice versa.   A Part II scheme relating to not more than 10 houses must be dealt with by the Borough Council.     Sub-clauso II of clause 8 is consequential on sub-clause 1 in Its application to London. There is something to be said for transferring the power of carrying out part I and II schemes entirely to the County/Council
Council, but cases arise where a borough council is prepared to go on with a scheme which the County Council would not be willing to take up immediately and the clause as drawn will permit this,10.   Clauses 9,, 1() and 11 ^These clauses are propce ed with a view to simplifying future consolidation and to get rid of confusion which arises on account of varying provisions in different.parts of the Housing Acts,11,    clause 12.Section 15 of the Housing Act 1909 and Section28 of the Act 1919   deal with sunstantially the same matter,the repair of unsatisfactory houses.Difficulty as to the interpretation of thesesections has arisen owing to conflicting decisions of theHigh Court,     It is proposed to repeal the earlier section and to make clear that an owner has a right to appeal beforeworks are carried, out by a local authority as well as on receipt of demand for payment of expenses Incurred by theLocal Authority,Sub-clause c repairs an omission in the existing law.     At present while a local authority can allow, an owner to repay over a period of years scats .incurred by- the Authority in. carrying out improvements to houses Icudefault of the owner, they have no power to spread their own expenditure ow a period of years. In some eases this prevents local authorities from taking action, -.It is a matter for consideration whether appsaunder this clause should not be to the Justices insteadof to the Minister,14.    Clause 13,
14 *&apos;      Clause 131At present where a local authority have been given power to carry out a Part I. scheme they cannot enter on any property for the purpose of proceeding with the scheme until the whole question of compensation is settled.This frequently results in considerable delay. In connection with Part II. schemes there is provision for entry,, but only upon compliance with the cumbrous procedure of the Lands Clauses Acts.     The clause provides for. a right, of entry with proper safeguards as to compensation. 15 *   CLauseM.4.House builders contend     that one of the great difficulties in the way of revival of house building is the cost of street works,- which they maintain are made very expensive by the.operation of insufficiently elastic bye-laws,     The clause will enable a local authority to look on the development of an estate as a whole and to permit lighter construction in the less important streets.     $here construction of a lighter kind is permitted, it will usually be desirable to.impose certain conditions on the owner of adjoining land.     Under the existing law these conditions cannot, be enforced against future owners of the land, and sub-clause (2) is intended to meet this point,16.   Clause 15.     This is Intended to remedy a defect in Section 44 of the Act of 1909, which in practice has been found to be unworkable owing to the necessity under that Section of proving that the erection .of dwellings has in fact been tijubudlod&apos; as a result of the restrictive character of the bye-law a,17. Clause 16, This clause applies the provisions of the Acquisition of Land Act. to the settlement of questions ; of conpensatiion and betterment arising under a Town Planning scheme&apos;&apos;.
Further clauses will be required to provide for the scheme bf dealing with the less hopeless slum areas., which .has been approved by the Housing Committee of the Cabinet and is to be discussed at the meeting of the Home Affairs Committee on the 21st of february, ,18* Clause 17,The OounaiLof-every Borough-and Urban District with a population of more than 20;000 is required under the Act of 1919 to submit a Town Planning Scheme within three years from 1st January, 1923,    This clause extends the period to 6 years -the extension is desired by the local authorities and is necessary, 19. Clause 18.Amendment to the Small Dwellings Acqusition Acts, The requirement that the owner of a house must-occupy^ the house may render the house   almost unsaleable and it is proposed to limit this requirement to 5 years..   Local authorities are given a complete discretion as to the amount of loan which may be advanced ,and provision is also made for advances as the building of a house progresses.
