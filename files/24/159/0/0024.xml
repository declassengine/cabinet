181   /3THIS DOCUMENT IS TH3 PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET. STANDING   JOINT   COMMITTEE   POH   EX-SERVICE   QUESTI0N8.FURTHER   1.ISL10RANDUM   BY   THE   MINISTER OF LAB0U3.1.   The Cabinet have now before them the observations of the Secretary of State for war (CP.40 (23)) and the Secretary of State for air (CP. 47 ( 2)) regarding the memorandum by the Minister of pensions (CP. 4372) and a memorandum by me (CP, 4373J as to the scope of the Standing Joint Committee for ex-Service men&apos;s questions.S.   It will be remembered that there were two points at issue -(i)   whether the Committee should have jurisdiction to deal with questions which affect pre-war men and post-war men, as well as questions affecting Great-War men;(ii)   whether, apart from the decision on jurisdiction, it is not possible to continue tho work on a compromise basis for a further period of 12 months.The position now taken up hy the various Departments is as follows3.   The Minister of Pensions is prepared, as to (ii), if the ex-Service men accept a temporary compromise, to oontinue to take part In the work of the Committee.   But he thinks as to (i) that if the Cabinet decide that ex-Service questions generally, including questions of post-war servioe, should be discussed in Committee, tho composition of the present Committee should be altered.
4.   The Secretary of State for Jar has much doubt, as to (i), whether any Committee of Ex-Service Men&apos;s Organisations is necessary for such questions, i,e. questions affecting post-war regular personnel, but, as to (ii), he has no objection to the proposed compromise being tried, if the ex-Service representatives are agreeable, for 12 months.   He holds the view that if thereafter a Committee is considered desirable for debating questions affecting post-war personnel an entirely separate Committee should be set up for the purpose.5.   The Secretary of State for Air, while recording the opinion that the remitting of questions affecting such personnel to a Committee of this description is open to objection on Service grounds, is also willing, as to (ii), to accept the compromise proposed if the British Legion are prepared to become a willing party to it.6.   The First Lord of the admiralty is prepared, as to (ii), to carry on with the existing compromise for the further period proposed.7.   Por the reasons I have previously laid before the Cabinet, I think it undesirable that the question of jurisdiction should be determined at this moment.   In view of the expressions of opinion from the Heads of the Service Departments,&apos; I think there is substantial agreement that, provided the British Legion concur, the existing compromise basis should be continued for a further 12 months - to (say) the 1st February, 1923.8,   This proposed compromise arrangement is as follows: -11 It is clear that a question raised in connection with an ex-soldier may frequently have application to
an ex-soldier of the Great War as well as to a post-war soldier, although the question may happen to arise first on a post-war case.     It has accordingly been proposed and agreed to by all Government Departments concerned that questions of such a oharac-ter may be raised and replied tc by the representatives of tho Departments, including tho war Office, without specifying whether they arise in the first instance on a Great War of a post-war case,     If in the course of the discussion it becomes clear that the ease in question is a post-war one, ordinarily the discussion will not be pursued unless or until it appears that some Great War case is, or may be, also involved.&quot;9.   Unless, therefore, objection is raised by any of my colleagues within two weeks from this date, I propose that, without troubling the Cabinet further, negotiations should be opened with the British Legion on this  basis.(Intd)   Mo B.February 22nd3 1923.
