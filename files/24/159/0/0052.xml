(T Jfto  -U j        L   J 408/THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET. BRIGHTON   DIAMOND   FACTORY.Memorandum-by the Minister of Labour.1.     There ia a serious and urgent question involved !0.P. 158 (25).ae to whether this Diamond Factory can bo continued, and I desire to lay the facts shortly boforo the Cabinet,2.     The Diamond Factory waa started in 1918, by tho late Sir Bernard Oppenheimer and- gentlemen who, I bolleve, are his partners, - namely Messrs. Lewis and Marks.     The Factory was expensively constructed, and the premises are admirable.     Sir Bernard Oppenheimer had two objects in view -(a) To introduce a new industry, namely, Diamond Cutting, to the country; and(b) To demonstrate that this new industry can be carried out by ex-Service, and largely by disabled men.The Factory was in operation from early in 1919,till tho end of 1929.     Some 250 ex-Service men, nearly all disabled, were trained in Diamond Cutting, andwere enabled to secure a satisfactory living, theirwages on a piece-work basis varying from  2.10 to 5 a week.3.     During the three yoars from 1919 to the end of last year, the Diamond Industry was very much depressed, and losses were incurred by the Factory, as they had to carry a very largo stock of uncut and half-cut stones.     The Diamond Industry is now on
the up-grade, and good prices are being realised gonarally.4.     Sir Bernard 0pp6nheimer died early in 1923, and left the financial affairs of the Factory and of his own-estate in some uncertainty.     His partners brought in Dutch managers, who have been carrying on the business since, but for the last five months the staff has been greatly reduced, and the Factory is now olosed,Messrs. Lewis and Marks state that they have lost a good doal of money over this Factory, and they are not able to continue unless a quarter-of-a-million is avail-able by way of additional working capital.     They propose to reconstruct the Company-, and, If this additional working capital were available, to reduce the rather heavy overhead charges j, co as to get the business on to a sound basis.5.     Great pressure has been put upon me by the ex-Servios men and the British Legion, and also by the Labour Party, who are very anxious that the Factory should be maintained.     I have also received representations from the Brighton Town Council on the same lines.It will be something like a tragedy if the 250 ex-service men, largely disabled, who have been oarning a decent living at the Factory, are now turned into the streets.I arranged with Sir Robert Kinderslsy and the Trade Facilities Committee that Messrs. Lewis and Marks should be interviewed with a view to having the whole business situation of tho Company examined by expert financiers, and with a view also to oeoing whether any guarantee under the Trade Facilities Aot were possible.
The Trade Paoilities Committee&apos;were&apos; prepared at that time on the facts to recommend the following, namely(a) That the Government should guarantee  150,000;this to he secured by a prior charge on the buildings and all the working stock of the Company;(b) Messrs. Lewis and Marks to put up  50,000 atonce and assume liability for a further  50,000; these sums to rank behind the Government money;(c) Messrs. Lewis and Marks to purchase tho propertyfrom the Receiver appointed by the holders of notes amounting to  300,000 in accordance with a liability already undertaken by them.It proved, however, that as the guarantee would in factresult in the provision of working capital, that the A**tdid not permit of this being done.     Consequently, if theFactory is to be saved, and State assistance is to be forth-ooming, there appear to be only two methods, either -(1) An actual State subvention of  150,000; or(ii) The passing of a short agreed Bill giving expresspower to guarantee ad hoc for this Factory, on the ground that it is provision for disabled men, and that would of course be a definite term in any arrangement made.&apos;5.     I urge upon my colleagues that a short Bill should beintroduced accordingly, for the following reasons :-(i) If the Factory is permanently closed, these 250men will have to be trained for other work.     That will cost the State probably  40,000 or  50,000, and in any case,when the men are so trained it will be difficult to find forthem remunerative occupation on anything like the same scale.(ii) The training and work done has undoubtedly been good; so much so that during the laBt few months, while theFactory has been suspended, a number of those who wore working at Brighton have gone to Amsterdam., and have been able tosecure remunerative work there against the highly skilledDutch workmen who have a long inherited tradition of diamondcutting.(iii) There may be a prejudice against the firm in
question, and against the Government co-operating with them.    On the othor hand, it is to be borne in mind :-(a) That they have themselves, while the Factoryhas been suspended, been voluntarily allowing each-one of the 250 employees  1 a week, which is clearly a very&apos; liberal arrangement.(b) Provided the security is adequate, so thatthe State can be reasonably euro of getting its money back, I do urge that tho interest of tho 250 disabled men should far outweigh any prejudice of the kind indicated,(iv) Suggestions have been made that the Factorycannot, under any circumstances, be successful aridfurther that only a small proportion - some 50 or 60 ofthe men trained, - are really effective.     these suggestions have been contained, 1 believe, in a letterwritten fcom South Africa to the Director of the Bankof England,     So far as my information goes, the suggestion as to inadequate skill is entirely incorroot.    Mycolleagues must beware of the source from which statements of this kind proceed,     The fact is that the Amsterdamring of Diamond Merchants and Diamond Gutters is a very close one, is very anxious that the Factory at Brightonshould fail, and is probably not too scrupulous in themethods it employs to indicate reasons why it should fail.(v) Our only hope of absorbing the vaet mass ofunemployed which wo are now carrying is the development ofexisting and, so far as possible, of new industries.     Ifthe Brighton Diamond Factory is closed, not only will the250 mainly disabled men lose their livelihood, but wo aredeliberately sacrificing the prospects of establishingan entirely new industry in the country.(Intld.)
