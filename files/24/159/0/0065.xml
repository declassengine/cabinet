Referred to.:   -GcintrtftteoofHomeAffairs *    IS POOtmSffiT. IS. -THE PROPERTY OP HIS Britannic MAJESTY&apos;S GOVPJulMKRT.gab.hst.JJORfoTWJM BY THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY TO THE TSJlSTRY OP TIaKBFORT, T13ET.L65(2S)LIGHTS OK VEHICLES BILL.,1.    The main objects of this Bill are:-(1)   to secure the consolidation of the lav? relating tolights on vehicles in order that on end may he put tothe confusion caused by diversity of practice indifferent parts of the country. (2)   to deal so far as Is practicable with the serious danger caused by tho unrestricted uso of powerfulheadlights on motor cars.I am convinced that legislation on this latter point must be considered aa urgent in view of the groat danger at present both to motorists and other users of tho road.     It will of course be Impossible to deal with headlights without first securing general legislation on lights on vehicles generally covorlng tho wholo country.2.      Thoro has been no general legislation on the subject since the very early days of the motor car.    So far as the general law is concerned, tho lighting requirements for tho most powerful modern type of motor car or motor omnibus aro thoso contained in tho Motor Cars (Use and Construction) Ordor, 1904.     This Order provides that &quot;the lamp to be carried attached to the motor oar in pursuance of Section 2 of the Act of 1896 shall be so constructed and placed as to exhibit, during ths period between one hour after sunset and one hour before cunrise, a white light visible within a reasonable distance in tho direction towards which the motor car is proceeding or is intended to proceed, and to exhibit a red light so visible in the reverse direction.    The lamp shall be placed on tho oxtroute right or off-side of the motor car in such a position as to be free from all obstruction to the light.&quot;3.      It will thus be seen that at present there is no general obligation on any vehicle to carry two lights or on any
-2-492vehicles other than a mechanically-propelled vehlolo to carry a rear red light.    Local regulation In many part3 of the country amplifies the general law, but with motor traffic continually   , passing on through journeys from one part of the country to the other it 1b clear that a goneral law is necessary.All parties and interests aro agreed that an end should be put to the confusion caused by the varying requirements of local bye-laws, and that the lighting of all road vehicles should be placed on a common basis definitely prescribed by Act of parliament.4.      Since this matter was last before tho Committee I haveInterviewed representatives of the motoring Interests represented on tho Departmental Committee, l.e. the Royal Automobile Club, theAutomobile Association and Motor Union, the Commercial Motor UserBAssociation, the Society of Motor Manufaoturers and Traders, andthe National and Provincial Omnibus Association.    Thoy wcrounanimous on tho following points -(i)   that tho Bill should be proceeded with at once.(il)   that the anti-dazele proposals should be put into operation as soon as possible(ill) that while red rear lights on pedal bicycles are in their opinion essential to safety, they will , support a bill which does not make them obligatory so long as they are assured (a) that In the event of an amendment being moved to make red rear lights compulsory the Government will leave the matter to the free decision of the Committee and of the House, and (b) that no provision for making the use of reflectors on bicycles obligatory ia iribluded in the bill as introduced by the Government.On theae two lattor points I gave them my assurance.5.      I ask leave, therefore, to introduce the Bill, withthe omission of any requirements as regards red rear lights onPttdal bicycles, leaving this point to the free decision of theBouse.(Signed) WILFRID ASHLEY.24th March, 1923
