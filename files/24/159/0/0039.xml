(TMs Doeuconx xs the Majesty2the Property of H ty1 s Government) *CABINET.Increase of Rent &amp; Mortgage Interest Restrictions (Continuance and Amendment) Bill.Memorandum, by the First Commissioner of Works. My attention has been drawn to Section 4 ofthis Bill.This Section deals with the question of rendering valid notices in Increase of rent under the Increase of Rent, etc., Act 1920, which are now technically invalid.   I am responsible for several Housing Estates scattered.all over England and Scotland belonging to the late Ministry of Munitions, the total number of tenants on the Estates being about 10,000 with a gross rental of about  245,000.per annum. In the past, my Department have increased the rents, as allowed by the Act of 1920, after serving appropriate notices.   In several casos,&apos; however, it has been recently discovered that the notices of Increase have demanded a rent which is, in fact, a fraction of a penny more than Is legally allowed by the Rent Restrictions Act of 1920.   The reason for this was that the agent, in calculating tho percentage increaso allowed by the 1920 Act, has,.In accordance with the usual commercial practice, calculated the Increase to the nearest penny, with the result that rents which are iri fact a fraotion of a penny more than the percentage increase have been demanded - as it now appears, illegally.    I have been advised by the Treasury Solicitor that such notices are wholly bad in law on a true construction of the 1920 Act.   This is of course a pure technicality, but one which it is of great importance should be remedied by the present Bill.Owing
. Owing to the advice of the Treasury Solicitor, my department has been/obliged to he sit at. before bringing action against many tenants in arreaj with their rents, because it ia feared that their legal advisers may take the technical objection referred to, and several applications to the Court have-been held up in the hope that the Bill would remedy the technicality referred to.   If a tenant successfully maintained the objection before the Court, the result, having, regard to the class of tenai &apos; &apos; in occupation of the houses,. would be disastrous fro^&apos; ; &apos; the point of view of the effective, management of thoEstates, as many tenants would thereby be able to obi exemption from payment of their arrears.I am advised that if the following words .. . &quot;served after the passing of this Act&quot; in lines 1 anof Section 4 (l) and in lines 2 and 3- of Section 4 .. . ; were omitted, the difficulty which my Department is experiencing could be got&apos;over.:/v,&apos;; &apos; There is all the more reason for the adopt&apos;  &apos;    of this course because, If the words in question are. ,?&apos; allowed to stand in those two subsections, they will&apos;: : &apos;; &quot;&quot; afford in practice no appreciable relief, to landlord &quot; &apos; generally, as practically, all .the notices, of increas&apos; &apos;      under the 1920 Act were delivered long ago, and the section, if the words &quot;served after the passing of tJ Act&quot; are- retained, would only apply to notices served after the passing of the-Bill, which will certainly tg very few in numberoI would, therefore, submit for the Cabinet consideration that the words in quesoion be deleted from Section 4 of tho Bill.J.B..H.M.
