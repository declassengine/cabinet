SECRET.23 THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY CPHIS BRITANLIC Ma. JESSY&quot; S GOVMttfJMMT.0.8.23.C A 3 I N I] T. NAVY ESTIMATES for    1923 - 1924 Menoran&amp;un by the First Lord of the inequality.The sun for which I propose to ask. Parliament for the Navy in 1923-24 amounts to  50,000,000, a reduction of nearly seven millions on the amount for the current year. This is the figure to which I have been asked by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to reduce the Navy Estimates. It has been with no inconsiderable effort that the Board of Admiralty have devised moans to achieve this reduction without seriously impairing the efficiency of our accepted Naval strength.Luring 1923-24 progress will be made With the two Capital Ships laid down at the end of 1922 as well as with the Cruiser Minelayer building at Devonport.     The experi-nental Submarine building at Chatham will be completed. Designs will be got out and pielir.ir.ary work (amounting to about  10,000 in all) done preparatory to the laying down of a new type of Submarine in the following year.   No existing type is suitable for work in extonded areas such as nay have to be provided for in a future war and it is the It. intention of the Admiralty to make trial by the projected vessel of a new typo of patrol submarine to nest this need.The Estimates include a snail provision for tho connenconent of the scheme for a Naval Base at Singapore in accordance with the cabinet&apos;s decision: and also for tho continuance of the building up, though at a rate still further reduced, of the reserves of oil fuel at hone and abroad which are essential for the maintenance of our naval position in the event of war.L.
