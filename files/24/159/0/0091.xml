[This Docainaat iMhe- Property of His Britannic Bfajesty&apos;s Government]I circulate to my colleagues a Memorandum respecting the &quot;representation of Members of the League of Nations at the Annual Assembly by persons not their own nationals.April 10, 1923.The report of the British delegates at the third Assembly of the League, held at Geneva in September 1922, contained the following passage : &quot; The difficulty which non-European States experience in being represented at the Assembly by their own nationals is obvious and has in some cases led to the inclusion of European members in a non-European delegation. Thus at the recent Assembly, Englishmen helped to represent New Zealand and South Africa and a Swiss professor was included among the representatives of Persia. The practice, if generalised, would be subject^ to obvious objections. So far, however, it has been kept within narrow limits, and by reason of the personal eminence of some of the individuals concerned has been productive of distinct advantage to the deliberations of the Assembly.&quot;The difficulty to which the above statement calls attention is of general application, but has a particular aspect for the British Empire. It may be expected that, in the case of nearly all European states, national pride and vanity alone would preclude the nomination of foreign subjects to represent the national interests in the League. The same consideration does not apply to oriental and semi-civilised states, who may easily be tempted to entrust their interests to selected foreign delegates, whether out of regard for the higher technical qualifications and generally greater competence to be found among such foreigners, or simply induced by bribery. The latter motive must also be reckoned with as being likely to influence the choice of delegates from the numerous South and Central American republics, where money considerations may be assisted by a desire to flatter, or be subservient to, the United States.The danger of foreign selections is real in many of these cases. There was an actual illustration of that danger, which is indirectly referred to in the same report of the British delegates, at the Assembly of 1922, already mentioned: The Persian Government had appointed as one of their delegates a Swiss professor, who, as a matter of fact, raised no question at the Assembly in which Persia might be assumed to have a special interest, but merely used his position in order to get universal recognition for the use of Esperanto as an international language, he being in fact an Esperanto maniac. The great inconvenience caused by his activity is described in the following extract from the British delegates&apos; report: &quot; The extension of the study and use of Esperanto as a universal language is not a subject upon which the Assembly or the committee as a whole was able to evince much enthusiasm, but the question gave rise to some little difficulty in the Fifth Committee, owing to marked traces of propaganda in favour of Esperanto, evidenced in the report collating the information received from foreign Governments on the subject during the past year. That report had been drawn up by an enthusiast in the cause of Esperanto, who had now obtained an appointment as a delegate of a foreign Government at the Assembly. It contained a misleading account of certain information provided by our own Board of Education as to the study and progress of Esperanto in schools in Great Britain. This gave rise to lengthy discussions, which ended in considerable modifications being introduced into the report, before it went to the Assembly.&quot;Printed for the use of the Cabinet.CONFIDENTIAL.C. of K.1469 [9731]
So far, the danger adverted to as regards South America has not materialised in the League, of Nations, but there is, under the existing rules, nothing to prevent the United States from packing the South American delegations with United States citizens, which would enable the United States to pursue their own. objects within the League, without being a member of that body, or having any responsibility for its decisions.   That this danger is not illusory may be seen    1* from what happened at one of the peace conferences at The Hague, in 1907.   In the following case it was not the United States, but a British enterprising newspaper, that inserted itself in an illegitimate manner into the body of the conference.   The      j Government of one of the Central American republics, in return for a payment, said at the time to have amounted to JE20,000, conferred the appointment of delegate representing their country upon an American correspondent of the British newspaper, which was in this way enabled to circumvent all rules concerning the confidential character of the proceedings.    The arrangement      I constituted a gross public scandal,.but remained undiscovered for a considerable      \ time.At the same conference China nominated as one of her delegates, Mr. Foster, a former Secretary of State in the United States, and when the important question I of the Immunity of Private Property at Sea came under discussion, China was made to stand out as the foremost supporter of the anti-British policy sheltering under that name, together with Panama, represented by an American professor also hailing from Washington.These are the kind of general risks which are similarly involved in the      \ system permissible under the present rules of the League..  There are special      j inconveniences inherent in it which more particularly affect the British Empire owing to the semi-independent position occupied by the Dominions in their relation to the League.   It has been the habit of some of the Dominions notably the Union of South Africa from the beginning, to appoint as their delegates British subjects domiciled in the United Kingdom, and having no special      i connection whatever with the particular Dominion.   There can be no doubt that this is quite contrary to the whole principle which underlay the claim of the Dominions to separate representation in the League; that claim rested on the     I idea that, in the discussion of general international problems, such as those with which the League has to deal, the peculiar interests of the several Dominions were not always necessarily identical with -^those of the mother-country, and that there was a special way of looking at such problems, which entitled the Dominions to have their views represented independently of the delegates of the United Kingdom.   This view, having been admitted, is to a large extent stultified     j if the Dominions appoint British Members of Parliament, or other men purely     \ representative of Great Britain, to speak for them in the League; and the     \ experience of the practice which has been followed certainly confirms, what might have been expected, that delegates so appointed as a rule make no pretence to represent the peculiar views of the Dominion, but merely pursue their own theories and opinions, such as they habitually advocate before the British public and in the British Parliament in the United Kingdom.The most distinguished of these representatives has undoubtedly been Lord E. Cecil. The prominent part which he took in the framing of the Covenant at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, and his close collaboration at the time with General Smuts, made it perhaps not unnatural that the latter should have formed the plan of making him one of the South African representatives at Geneva. Lord R. Cecil has always at Geneva acted with perfect loyalty to the delegation of the United Kingdom, but it will probably be admitted, even by those, who have the highest opinion of the value of his work in the League, that the ideas for which he has fought, and the suggestions which he has proposed, have practically nothing to do with any point of view peculiar to South Africa. He has never pretended to be anything but himself, and has always stood for the opinions which he openly and persistently professed as a member of the British Parliament. The same may be said, perhaps in a minor degree, of Sir Gilbert Murray, who has been Lord R. Cecil&apos;s colleague in jihe representation of South Africa. Last year New Zealand followed suit by appointing as her representative Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland, who, as a matter of fact, created not a little trouble for the British delegation to ,i last year&apos;s Assembly by taking up a line of his own about opium and about slavery in Abyssinia both questions in which New Zealand as such had no particular I interest whatever, and in which he took up an attitude which would never have I been authorised by the British Government had he represented them. I
3672These illustrations show where the danger lies if the practice of appointing uon-national delegates is allowed to continue and develop. We have already to deal with a movement which has from time to time found expression in many diverse quarters whose promoters claim that national representation in the League should not be that of governments, but of peoples, and. that the delegates of a particular country should be at liberty to express, and to act on, views and opinions not necessarily those of their governments. It is understood that at one time Mr. Barnes, appointed a delegate by the British Government to the Assembly at Geneva, insisted on receiving, and was given, permission to speak and vote in a sense opposed to that of his Government. It is probably owing to its having been recognised in this country how inconvenient, if not dangerous, such a proceeding might be that it has not, so far as I know, been repeated. But it is clear that such danger is likely to be much enhanced if the Dominions, including India, were to take to appointing as their delegates to the Assembly members of His Majesty&apos;s Opposition in the British Parliament. No reliance can to-day be placed on absolute respect for the principle of continuity of foreign policy as between British parliamentary parties, and it might easily happen that, in a question of the greatest import in the international relations of this country, on which there was a serious division of opinion between the Government and the Opposition in Parliament, antagonistic views might actually be represented in the delegation of the United Kingdom. It will be admitted that such a situation would be liable to cause serious embarrassment to the British Government.It is one thing for a delegate, native of one of the Dominions, to take in the Assembly a different view on a foreign question from His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United Kingdom. It would be a very different thing if such opposite views were expressed ostensibly in the name of one of the Dominions, or perhaps even a foreign state, but, in fact, by a member, or perhaps even the leader, of the. British Parliamentary Opposition.There is really only one remedy, and that is to restrict representation in the League to delegates nationals of the states or dominions which they represent. There is however nothing in the terms of the Covenant which at present prevents representation by a foreigner, and to render such an appointment invalid will entail an amendment to article 3, which, on this point, merely provides that &quot;the Assembly shall consist of representatives of the members of the League.&quot; It has been suggested that the desired object might be attained by a friendly understanding between the more important Powers. As a matter of fact, this would not really be sufficient, because it is just the less important Powers who are most tempted to resort to the practice criticised. It is accordingly suggested that definite proposals be made for the amending of the Covenant. It will be realised that the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government in taking such a step is rendered peculiarly delicate owing to the place occupied, not only in the eyes of public opinion in many countries, but also within the League itself, by the personality of Lord Bobert Cecil. Those who have attended the several meetings at Geneva are deeply imbued with the great importance of the part which he has played there, and it is clearly desirable to avoid if possible any appearance of personal hostility to him. If a suggestion may be offered for dealing with this difficulty, it may be suggested for consideration whether some arrangement could not be made by which Lord R. Cecil would be offered the position of a delegate representing the Home Government. There can be no doubt that, if he accepted that position, he would not hesitate to recognise the authority of the Cabinet as conveyed through the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and would loyally carry out any directions given.Foreign Office, March 24, 1.923.
