[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1923.SECRET.CP. 179 (23).CABINET.PALESTINE : THE RECENT ELECTIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary oe State for the Colonies.I CIRCULATE, for the information of my colleagues, a Memorandum prepared in the Colonial Office on the subject of the recent elections in Palestine.1. The Palestine Order in Council of the 10th August, 1922, provided for the constitution of a Legislative Council in Palestine and for the election of part (twelve out of twenty-two) of the Members of the Council. Article 22 provided that the first general election of the Legislative Council shall be held not more than six months after the publication of the order in the &quot; Palestine Gazette.&quot;2. The Palestine Legislative Council Electoral Order, 1922 (the .10th August, 1922), prescribed the system of election of the twelve Elected Members (see Appendix I). It was to come into operation on a date to be fixed by the High Commissioner.3. The two Orders were published in the official Gazette of the Government of Palestine on the 1st September, 1922. Accordingly, the first general election was. due to be completed before the 1st March, 1923.4. At the time when the Constitution of Palestine was being elaborated by the Colonial Office and Sir Herbert Samuel, the Palestine Arab Delegation was present in London. One modification of the Constitution was made at their suggestion, namely, the omission of the members (three in number) to be nominated to the Legislative Council by the. High Commissioner; but in general they adopted an intransigent attitude. They were unwilling to co-operate in the formation of a Constitution which took for granted the Balfour Declaration and the Zionist policy. This opposition was also carried on and intensified in Palestine from about the summer of 1922, and as the time for the elections approached, at the beginning of February, a meeting was held at the offices of the Executive Committee of the Arab-Palestinian Congress, at which it was decided to boycott the elections for the Legislative Council. On the 3rd February the Executive Committee published a proclamation calling for the boycott of. the elections. On the 6th February the High Commissioner received representatives of the Executive Committee and addressed them on the subject of the elections (vide Appendix H).5. Through a misunderstanding the High Commissioner^ &quot; Proclamation for Holding the Elections of Secondary Electors &quot; laid down a procedure which would not have resulted in the election of members of the Legislative Council being completed before the 1st March.; this would have, in any case, necessitated some extension of the period allowed for the completion of the elections (see paragraphs 7 and 8 below). .6. The nomination of.,secondary electors was carried out between the 20th and 28th February.DEVONSHIRE.Colonial Office, March 28, 1923.The Palestine Elections.(Memorandum by Middle East Department, Colonial Office.)[9750]B
&apos;(. On the 1st March the High Commissioner reported that to fill some 700 vacancies, only sixty-eight Christian and Moslem secondary electors had been nominated. There were eighty-nine nominations in Jewish voting areas. It was his opinion that an important section of the population with certain leading, men were desirous of taking part in the elections, but, owing to the propaganda of the Arab Congress, had up to that, time been debarred. He had received definite assurances that, if a little time longer were given, this party and these men would co-operate in the elections. For this,reason, and because the procedure in this first election was not fully understood by the population, he reported that the period allowed for the election had been extended until the 7th March, and recommended a further extension, by a total amount of two months, till the 30th April.8. The Secretary of State approved this proposal (as he was empowered to do under Article 87 of the main Order in Council), but left it to the High Commissioner^ discretion whether the total extension should be for two or three months. The High Commissioner adopted three months, ie., until the 31st May, 1923.9. On the 9th March the High Commissioner reported the following results of nomination of secondary electors for the Legislative Council: Moslems ... ... ... 126 for 670 vacancies.Jews ... ... ... 90 ,,   79      ,,Christians .... ... ... 27 ,,   59      ,,Druses ... ... ... 8 ,,   15      ,,10. On the 10th March the High Commissioner reported that in Samaria and the Southern Districts there had been an almost complete boycott of the elections ;&apos; also in Jaffa Town. The High Commissioner was opposed to forming twelve colleges from the available secondary electors to elect the full number of twelve members to the Legislative Council, as required by the Order in Council. Having regard to the small number of returns he suggested that five colleges only should be formed, viz.: One Moslem College in the Jerusalem District One Moslem College in the isorthern District. One Christian Oollege^for the whole country. Two Jewish Colleges for the whole country.He recommended that the remaining seven seats should either be left vacant or preferably be filled by nomination. Lastly, he had under consideration, as a supplement to the Legislative Council, the formation of a large consultative Committee, which would &quot; serve as a theatre for the discussion of important questions,&quot; and on which all sections of the population would be represented.11. On the 10th March a District Governors&apos; Conference was held in Jerusalem and unanimously confirmed the views of the High Commissioner.12. On the 14th March the Secretary of State telegraphed that the High Commissioners proposals would involve an amendment of the Orders in Council, and that he was not prepared to consider action on such lines until he Was convinced the machinery provided under the Orders had finally broken clown. He urged that the Legislative Council should be made up to full strength by the formation of the full number of Colleges, viz., eight Moslem, two Jewish and two Christian, from the secondary electors actually elected; and he pointed out that there was nothing to prevent the Colleges from nominating persons in any part of Palestine. He considered that the amendment of the Orders in Council, Avithin a few months of their promulga-tion, would be tantamount to a public confession of failure.13. The final results of the primary elections were as follows : From the 436 voting areas in Palestine, nomination took place in 128 voting areas. Polls took place in twenty voting areas. The total number of secondary electors elected either with or without a poll were; Moslems   ... ... ... ... 107 out of 670Jews       ... ... ... ... 79     ,, 79Christians... ... ... ... 19     ,, 59Druses     ... ... ... ...     8     ,, 15Of the Moslem secondary electors, 59 belong to the Northern District and 36 to the Jerusalem District.14. On the .17th March the High Commissioner reported that the intention of all secondary electors to co-operate in the election of members of the Legislative Council
could not be assumed. He bad already received three applications for withdrawal. On the 21st March the High Commissioner replied to the Secretary of State&apos;s telegram of the 14th March (see paragraph 12). He strongly deprecated any attempt to fill the ten seats through the available secondary electors, though.he fully appreciated the objections to amending the Orders in Council. He gave the following reasons for his view: (1.) There would be intense opposition to a Council so formed and the political situation would be almost certainly embittered by such a step, which might possibly lead to an organised refusal to pay taxes.(2.) There were not enough Christian electors on the final list to form two Colleges capable of nominating members of the Legislative Council.(N.B. There were nineteen on the final list of Christian secondary electors, whereas, under Article 14 of the Electoral Order in Council, each member of the Legislative Council requires to be nominated by a proposer and a seconder, ancl by eight other duly qualified secondary electors, ie., by ten persons in all.)(3.) It was extremely doubtful if the secondary electors would co-operate in such action.15. Sir H. Samuel accordingly proposed, if the secondary electors stood firm, to make the following arrangements :  Two Moslem members and one Christian member for the Jerusalem District. Two Moslem members for the Northern District. Two Jewish members for the whole country.This would leave the following seats vacant for the present, to be filled up by bye-elections, as soon as people were ready to elect: Two Moslem seats in Samaria.Two Moslem seats in the Southern District.One Christian seat.16. Sir H. Samuel assumed that an arrangement on these lines could be carried into effect without recourse to an amending Order in Council; but the Secretary of State&apos;s Legal Advisers do not consider that this assumption can be made with complete safety.17. The High Commissioner further stated (telegram of the 21st March) that the co-operation of a consultative Committee to deal with questions not giving rise to controversy was at present under consideration by the Arab Executive. He considered that if such a Committee were formed and an incomplete Legislative Council constituted as a temporary measure, the situation might possibly be improved and would not be left more strained than heretofore. In any case, he considered that it might not be advisable to make any announcement before the Nebi Mousa Festival on the 30th March.18. The whole question is now engaging the close attention of the Secretary of State. Having regard to the opinion of the Colonial Office Legal Advisers, it is not considered practicable to adopt Sir H. Samuels plan under the existing Orders in Council. The objections to the issue of a new Order are obvious ; but there may be no other way of dealing with the situation that has arisen. If a new Order is to be issued, it ought not to be so framed as merely to give the High Commissioner power to carry out the particular plan that he has in view. If his secondary electors fail him (and we have no guarantee that they will not), that plan will break down in its turn, and we may be faced with the demand for yet another Order in Council to put matters right. Clearly that would place us in an impossible and ludicrous position. The new Order, if one is to be issued, must be drawn in terms sufficiently wide to cover all contingencies and to enable the High Commissioner in any event to carry on the administration of Palestine, with or without the assistance of a Legislative Council.Middle East Department, Colonial Office,March 21, 1923. &quot; .....[9750]
APPENDIX IMethod of Election of the Legislative Assembly in Palestine.Members of the Legislative Assembly are elected by indirect election, i.e., not directly by the whole body of the electorate, as, for example, in the Parliamentary elections in this country, but indirectly by primary electors, who elect secondary electors, and directly by the secondary electors.The details of these two processes are :-1. Primary Voters. Every male. Palestinian citizen over 25 years of age (with the usual exceptions of criminals, bankrupts; &amp;c.) is a primary voter.2. Secondary voters are elected by the primary voters, who for this purpose are grouped roughly into areas including about 200 primary voters. The areas correspond as far as possible to villages and quarters of towns and to religious communities. If all the secondary electors were elected, the total numbers would be-Moslems ....       ... ... ... ... 670Jews ...         ... ... ... ... 79Christians ...         ... ... ... &apos;   ... 59Druses....... ... ... ... 153. The secondary electors are then grouped into twelve colleges by the High Commissioner, i.e., eight for Moslems, two for Christians and two for Jews. In addition to this classification by communities, the colleges are to be so distributed as to cover Palestine as far as possible.4. Each of the electoral colleges elects one member of the Legislative Council.5. There will, therefore, be twelve unofficial members of the Legislative Council.APPENDIX II.Report of Interview between Sir H. Samuel and Executive Committee of Palestine Arab Congress^ February 6, 1923.Present:Sir Herbert Samuel, High Commissioner.Sir Wyndham Deedes. Mr. Bentwich. Mr. Richmond. Mr. Luke. Hafiz Bey Toukan. Abdul Nader Muzaffer. Ibrahim Eff. Shammas. Auni Bey Abdul Hadi. Issa Eff.&apos;Al-Bandak. Jamal Bey Husseini.SIR HERBERT SAMUEL : I am glad that you are able to attend here this afternoon. I would desire to make a statement with regard to the elections, and afterwards I shall be very glad to hear any observations that you would wish to make.I have observed in the Press and elsewhere the objections that have been made to the elections, and the protests that have been made against them.The Government is unable to accept your objections for the reasons which I shall give: In June of last year His Majesty&apos;s Government in London made a statement of policy which provided for the summoning of a Legislative Council in Palestine, and in August of last year&quot; His Majesty King George signed an Order in Council providing a Constitution for Palestine on similar lines. Moreover, the League of Nations has sanctioned a mandate for Palestine in which the Administration is required to develop self-governing institutions.   It is therefore necessary to give an opportunity to the
f( 5people of Palestine to elect representatives in-order to express their desires in accordance with the Constitution. y. ...I would now refer to the letter which.your Committee has addressed to the Government on the subject of Education, to which there has not yet been a written reply. Your proposals have, however, been very fully considered in accordance with the importance that attaches to the subject. You propose that there should be a Body elected from, the whole people to control the education of the country. I agree that the people of Palestine should have a larger share in the control of education than they now possess, but it is a matter for consideration whether that control could best be. exercised through local or through central bodies. Indeed, the Government is anxious to develop local self-governing institutions. Such development is also required by the terms of the Mandate. Moreover, Education is only one matter of great importance to the people ; Agriculture, Commerce and Industry, Health, Public Works are all matters which are of vital importance to the people ; it is impossible to elect a Central Council for each&apos; one of them, but if that were done in the case of Education the same principle might properly apply in these other matters. In all constitutional countries it has been found advisable to have a Central Authority a Legislative Assembly which exercises general control over all. But in any case I would point out to you that if your proposal with regard to Education were accepted as it stands a new Law would De needed, and constitutionally the consent of the Legislative Council would be required, so that your request must ultimately be referred to that Legislative Council. I would remind you that in that Legislative Council the Elected Members would be in the majority, although it is true that if any section of the Elected Members voted with the Government, the Government would have the majority. At the same time I would repeat what has been said before that this Government, or any Government, would be very slow to reject any measure which was supported by proper feeling as expressed in the Council, and would only do so in the case of absolute necessity.The same considerations which I have mentioned with regard to Education apply to Finance. There is a good deal of discussion in the1 country with regard to the methods of taxation, and there is no doubt that there is room for a reform in the matter of taxation. Particularly it is complained that the agricultural population pay heavy direct taxes, and that the townspeople pay much less heavy direct taxes, although it must also be remembered that the Customs Revenue is a very large one, and this is mainly paid by the townspeople. I consider that we ought to reform the direct taxes of the country. The Temettu Tax imposed by, the Turks yielded very little ; it was very unequal in its incidence, and gave rise to a great deal of trouble in its collection. I am proposing to appoint a Committee to consider the Temettu Tax, hut here also I would wish to have the advice and co-operation of elected representa-tives of the people, and I should propose to put upon such a Committee Elected Members of the Legislative Council, among other members. Similar considerations apply to proposals for Customs changes, so that in all these matters it is very desirable that the Government should have the advice of men who have been elected by ordinary constitutional means.At the same time I have not hurried on with the elections. In the first place the registration of voters has taken some time, and has only recently been completed; and also there have been two events which took place at the end of last year which I have had to take into account one was the summoning of a new Conference to examine the revision of the Treaty of Sevres, and the other was the change of Government and the elections of a new Parliament in England.It was suggested here that one or both of these events might cause a change in policy as it affected Palestine. I personally did not think so, but I thought it advisable that the point should be made clear, if possible, before the new elections were held in Palestine. A Delegation of your body went to Lausanne, and from Lausanne to London. At the interview which I had the pleasure of having with them before they left, I told them that, while I was not sure that Palestine would not be discussed at Lausanne, I thought it most unlikely ; and that has proved to be the case it was not. discussed. And in London the Delegation was told that there was no prospect of a change in the policy expressed in the White Paper. Therefore the recent events in Turkey ancl Lausanne and in London, ancl the visit of the Delegation, have made no difference, arid the situation is exactly the same as it was. The position, therefore, has been made quite clear in that respect to the people of Palestine.We are now approaching. the latest date provided in the Constitution for the holding of the elections and, with the full approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government, I am proposing to hold the elections this month.   1 have to-day signed,. at a meeting
of my Executive Council, a Proclamation, which, will be published immediately, appointing the dates of the 20th-28th February for the nomination of the secondary electors ; the polling, if any is necessary, would take place not later than seven days after the nominations. The Governors will appoint the exact days for holding the nominations and polls in the various Districts. The elections will be held, as you are aware, on the same principle as under the Turkish Constitution, and the secondary electors who are chosen by these nominations will meet for the election of the twelve members of the Legislative Council. These further elections will be held in the month of March.&apos;. I have requested your attendance here to-day because I thought it courteous and proper to inform you of this step and of the reasons for it. It is my earnest desire that all sections of the population should participate in these elections. If it were the case that the Government was not anxious to promote the well-being of the people, the Government would not urge this. If it were true, as is sometimes alleged, that it is desired to undermine the interests of the people, we should rather welcome their abstention from the polls. But as I am convinced that it will be proved by the work of the Legislative Council that the Government desires to promote to the fullest extent the physical conditions allow the well-being of the whole country, and every section in it, I am eager that all sections of the population should be represented in the Council in order to share in that work. Moreover, criticism in the Council and suggestions from all the different points of view would be useful to us in helping us to fulfil our duty in providing good government for the people.I would add this final word : The method of non-participation in elections has been adopted in many countries at various times. 1 remember myself cases the abstention of the Greek population in Cyprus, of the native population in Jamaica, and of large numbers of extremists in India, yet this step has never had any effect in any one of these cases&apos; it has always been a failure. The Government always goes on, and must go on; the only effect is that those who do not participate lose their share of influence over the course of legislation and administration. Experience goes to show that it is inside the Legislature and not outside it, that is the best sphere in which to promote the interests of the population.The Members of the Congress then retired to discuss the matter before replying to his Excellency.   Upon their return , HAFIZ BEY TOUKAN said N Your Excellency, ^ the Fifth Arab Congress, representing all sections of the Arab population of Palestine, has decided to reject the Constitution that was issued in London, about which the Arab population of Palestine was not asked for an expression, of an opinion, and the Arab nation has found it injurious to its interests, and has unanimously decided to reject and boycott the elections. VVe therefore do not think it necessary to enter into any detailed discussion on the subjects mentioned by your Excellency.SIR HERBERT SAMUEL: I should like to add to what has been said, that if you, and those you represent, abstain from the elections now you must not complain afterwards if legislation is passed without consulting you and those whom you represent.An opportunity for consultation is offered to you now; if it is not taken, the responsibility for the facts of non-consultation in the future will rest with yourselves and not with the Government.It is my duty to add one further word. It may be that abstention from the elections will not be so unanimous as you consider likely, and it is well, as I do not want to come into conflict with you, to explain what the situation would be in that respect. The Government cannot compel, and does not seek to compel, persons to vote., You ,claim the right to abstain from voting. You have that right; but, on the other hand, you must not seek to interfere with the actions of others whose view of patriotism andof their duty to their country will lead them to accept the opportunity to share in its government. You may seek to induce a man to act as yon wish by convincing his reason, but not by threatening him and seeking to make him afraid. That is contrary to the law, and I am sure that you will agree that it should be contrary to the law, for it is the negation of all constitutionalism. If it is attempted, the whole force of the Government must be used to prevent it and to protect those who are injured, or threatened. Those who desire to participate in the elections^ will receive the most active protection should it be necessary. However, lam convinced that you are only anxious to conduct your movement within the limits of the law as hitherto, and I hope that we shall all be spared any difficulties on that head.I thank you for your attendance.
HAFIZ BEY TOUKAN : In the same manner&apos; as his Excellency feels he must act towards his Government in order to apply its policy, so we also have a duty to perform, ancl that is to give advice to the population of this country, and we feel that it the nation participates in the elections it will be the assassination of the nation. With regard to the point which his Excellency raised as to the use of threats in order to influence the people, we would say that we are only too eager and anxious to comply with the provisions of the law and regulations as much as, if not more than, the Government officials, and we shall not commit any actions which may be contrary to the law, as we are agreed to comply, with the law.SIR HERBERT SAMUEL: I am very glad to hear that expression of opinion from Hafiz Bey Toukan. Certainly the Government will not overstep on its side the hounds of constitutionalism, and I am glad that, as hitherto, we can look to you to use your influence in the same direction. It is quite clear that if the nation is, as you say, unanimously of opinion that it ought to abstain from the elections, there will be no need to use any threats to induce them to do so, or indeed to conduct any agitation at all.
