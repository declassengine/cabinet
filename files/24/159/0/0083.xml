&quot;Tho revolutionary workers of Great Britain are faced with the task of winning over the British Labour Party and the trade unions for a decisive action against the occupation of territory in Germany, and against tho danger of renewed war.   A comprehensive campaign must be carried out in the press, in Parliament, in the municipalities, by every means of publication, for the purpose cf enlightening the English working class on the situation in the Ruhr area, and on the pirate policy of the English bourgeoisie in Ireland,, in. the Hear and Far East, and especially in Turkey, India, and Egypt.   Tho working class is to be organized for the struggle against this polioy now being pursued by tho ruling class.&quot;It is necessary that the revolutionary proletariat in the army and navy conduct extensive propaganda against the bourgeois policy, and for the proletarian class struggle.&quot;The/THE OOMMUMISIISAccording to the issue of the &quot;Interactional PressCorrespondence11 dated March 29th; 1923, Walten Newboldstated at the Frankfurt conference on March 18th that,&quot;There is no probability of an effective intervention on the part of the masses of British worksr8 at the present juncture.   After two years cf unprecedented unemployment, there are still 400,000 registered unemployed.   The trade unions arm weakened, and the employers utilize every strike for the purpose of drawing cheap labour from the army of unemployed.   This, of course, is no excuse for the hypocritical tactics of trade union leaders of&apos;&quot; the description of Frank Hodges, who do not think at all of revolutionary action conjointly with the workers of other countries.&quot;The. old Conservative Party, accustomed to rule^ and infernally cunning, has brought about the union between England and America, under sonar Law&apos;s leadership.   France, on the other hand, is comparatively isolated.   Bo long as capitalist society continues to exist, British imperialism will never renounce its ambition of world domination.   It merely waits for its chance.&apos; The British workers are dissatisfied.   Their class consciousness is awakening.   For the first time in history millions of votes were cast for the Labour Party.   But this signifies no more than the millions of votes far German social democracy in 1914.     British imperialism is declining.   But at the present time the groat mass of British workers still think&apos; imperialistically;   they consider themselves members of a ruling class, and for this reason we cannot premise anything for the CP. of England whioh wo are hot in a position to fulfil.&quot;It was laid down at the Conference that:
&quot;&quot;She mess unemployment, the capitalist offensive in England, the attempts to lengthen working hours end reduce wages, the casting of the whole burden of taxation on the working class, the housing problem -all this must be made the subject of a broadly planned propaganda for the establishment of the proletariat united front against bourgeois class rule and bourgeois reaction.&quot;The Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain recently received from Moscow a secret circular regarding the educational or training section of the  arty in the course of which it is stated that:&quot;Concerning the Educational Section of the E.C.C.I.&quot;In compliance with the decision of tha Fourth World Congress a special section for Communist Educational Work has been attached to the Propaganda and Agitational section (Propagit) of the E.C.C.I.

With this object in view they must establish, in conjunction with the Propagit, a special Bection in their Central Committees for Communist Educational Work, or must at least appoint a Comrade (if possible a member of the Central Committee) to be responsible for the organization and control of the Educational work of the party.&quot;^Concerning the publication of party Schoolbooks and LiiTs of literature.&quot;The immediate task of the Educational section of tha E.C.C.I. will consist in:(a)   The publication of a manual for the propagation of the moat important decisions of the World Congress and of the sessions of the Enlarged Executive.

It must be remembered that these unions embrace considerable masses of workers, and the position of the office employee is of no mean significance.    Tho capitalist States carry out their dictatorship through the machinery of government, through banking and other credit institutions, through various offices.   They have a&apos;considerable support in the docile office Employees&apos; Unions.   It is necessary to shake the power of this support and break it away from under the capitalists.   There are definite grounds upon which to carry on successful revolutionary work among employees.   The masses of &apos; employees are now going through the process proletarisatlon. . Wages ta-e being cut both in government and in private institutions.   The livingcond itions/
624,conditions of the employees are becoming more and more difficult.&quot;We suggest the following concrete&apos; measures in this regard:1.    Due attention must he paid to the organisation of factions in all the employees&apos; unions.2.     A concrete programme of action should he worked&apos; out for the86 unions.3,     National conferences of factions and oppositions should he called upon the organisation of suoh faotione or. wherever they already exist.4.    A campaign should be started in the press exposing the activities of the social-treacherous leaders of the Employees&apos; Unions and throwing light upon the economic conditions of the employees.5.     The slogan of the merging of similar unions, of the application of the industrial principle in the unicn structure should be raised in the organisational field.6.     More adequate information on the economicsituation of the employees should be collected.7.    Monthly reports on the work of the factions, on the situation of the employees should be sent to the Secretariat of the International propaganda Committees of the Employees.8,     A comrade should be specially assigned to carry out the work among employees, and where one has already been assigned, he should be requested to report on his work.Kindly advise us of whatever steps jou may take in conforming with the suggestions of this letter, send a copy of your reply to tho international propaganda Committee of Employees.We have proposed that, after the measures stated in this letter are carried into effect, an international conference of revolutionary unions and minorities of employees be called in the summer of .. thi;.:. year somewhere in Western Europe.Fraternally youre,Zalnin (signed) Mamber of the Executive Bureau of the E.T.L.U.,        K. Abolin. (Signed) Secretaire fiu Comite International de propagande et d&quot;action des employes.&quot;THE UHEMPIOTOPOn April 1st only about 150 unemployed marched toTrafalgar Square to attend a demonstration at which GeorgeLansbury, Tern Mann, H. Co sling; and Major Attlee had beenbilled/
m q , 625billed to speak:   none of those men put in an appearance and the meeting, the object of which was &quot;to protest against reduction of relief, wages and doles also to protest against any deportations from this country or illegal arrests&quot; was a failure.On the same date tibovtt 100 people assembled in Willesden for a meeting which had been announced by the local unemployed tut tho speakers declined to leave on adjacent public-house and after 2f hours the platform was removed.The Chief Constable of Edinburgh- informs me that on March 28th some 50 unemployed, most of whom had marched from Glasgow, Alloa and Eirkcaldy arrived at the lid inburgh boundary and were met by about 200 of the local unemployed: deputations wore received by tho Scottish Boa-rd of Health and by the Education Department and a meeting was subsequently held at the Mound:   tho speakers were MoShane (Glasgow), Pearson (Kirkcaldy), poulis and. Smithies (Edinburgh) and Taylor (Aberdeen).     The last named was the most revolutionary speaker and McShane said that the unemployed should make themselves so dangerous that the Polico would requira to be increased by 100$ and that, if that were done, the Parish Council would comply with their demands.
