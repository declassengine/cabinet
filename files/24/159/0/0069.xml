This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government518SECRET.Copt No. j o,CP. 169/23.THE CABINET.THE ARMY AND AIR FORCE (ANNUAL) BILL.105 &quot;Gen. N(j:j 3032MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate the draft of the Army and Air Force Annual Bill, which should, as usual, receive the Royal Assent by 30th April. I propose to circulate it to Parliament at once as the debate will take place immediately after the Recess.I invite attention to Clauses 13 and 14 of the Bill. The former of these carries out a promise given to Parliament last year by making it easier in certain cases to enforce affiliation orders against soldiers and airmen. The latter defines the status of mandated territories as equivalent, for the purpose of the Army Act and Air Force Act, to that of protectorates.Otherwise there is I think nothing which calls for comment and the passage of the Bill will I hope be eased by a decision, which is about to be announced, to abolish the unpopular military punishment known as &quot; Field Punishment No. 1.&quot;D.The War Office, 26ift March, 1923.(b23/u1)   66  3/23  w.o.p.  769
Army and Air Force (Annual) Bill.NOTES ON CLAUSES. Clause 4.This clause will remove doubts which have arisen as to whether there is power to mitigate, remit or commute a punishment, such as the dismissal of an officer, or the reduction of a non-commissioned officer to the ranks.Clause 5.The proviso to s. 76 of the Army Act provides that hoys enlisted thereunder must be enlisted for a particular corps.The boys for whom the proviso was designed are boys intended to be trained in schools for special trades in the Army. But at the time of their enlistment it is not known in which corps their services will he required, or for what trade they are likely to show most aptitude.This clause therefore provides that such boys need not he enlisted for a particular corps, and need not he assigned to a particular corps until they attain the age of 18.Clause 6.The effect of this amendment is to extend the category of persons qualified to hold warrants for con-vening or confirming sentences of courts martial, by adding to the Army Act&apos; a provision similar to that already in the Air Force Act, ,hut as amended hy clause II of this Bill.Clause 7.The effect of this amendment is to &apos; permit officers of the Royal Navy who are appointed by the Admiralty as recruiting officers to attest recruits for the Royal Marines&apos;.Clause 8.This clause merely re-numbers s. 46 A of the Air Force Act.   The corresponding section of the Army Act 68-4 A
was similarly re-numbered by s. 5 of the Army and Air Force (Annual) Act, 1922......Clause 9.This clause contains a similar amendment of the Air Force Act to that contained in clause 4 with respect to the Army Act.Clause 10.This clause enables an airman enlisted for the whole term of his original enlistment in Air Force Service to he transferred to the reserve at any time within the last two years of the term of his service.The clause only applies in the case of boys the term of whose service is reckoned from their attaining the age of 18, and the power of transfer is not exercisable unless the man has during the first six years of his service been warned of his liability to such transfer.Clause 11.This clause extends the category of persons qualified to hold warrants for convening and confirming the sentences of courts martial to officers in command of any body of the Air Force serving beyond the seas, provided that the officer is of a rank not below that of squadron leader. ^Clause 12.S. 46 of the Army Act enables offences by soldiers to be dealt with summarily, and s. 47 enables officers to he so dealt with; but neither section applies to warrant officers not holding honorary commissions. Subsection (1) of this clause will enable all warrant officers to be dealt with summarily, as though they were officers, subject to the special provisions as to punishment which it is proposed to insert in s. 47.Subsection (2) supplements the previous subsection by prescribing the punishments which can be summarily awarded to warrant officers.Subsections (3) and (4) contain consequential amend-&apos;&apos;ments-.
Clause 13.This clause seeks to mitigate difficulties experienced by women in obtaining maintenance and affiliation orders against soldiers in two respects.(1) Under subsection (3) of s. 145 as it stands at present, service of a summons in such proceedings on a soldier is not valid if he is under orders for service beyond the seas. Cases have frequently occurred in which although a soldier is under such orders it is quite possible for him to answer the summons. Under this clause service in such a case will be valid unless the commanding officer certifies that it is not possible for the soldier to attend the hearing and return to his quarters in time to embark on service.(2) The amendment embodied in the clause also makes it clear that when the soldier is quartered within the jurisdiction of the court, or where the proceeding is before a court of summary jurisdiction within the petty sessional division in which the proceeding is instituted, conduct-money for the soldier need not he deposited with the commanding officer, and the process may be served on the soldier personally. In the latter case, however, a copy of the process must he sent to the commanding officer in order that he may have an opportunity of certifying that the soldier will not be able to attend the hearing in time to return to his quarters and embark for service overseas.Clause 14.This amendment removes doubts as to the status of mandated territory under the Army and Air Porce Acts. The question has arisen in Palestine as to whether the approval of the High Commissioner is necessary before the execution of a death sentence under s. 55 (7).68
