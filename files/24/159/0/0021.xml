IRE LESS SYSTEM.The origin;&apos;1 idea of nv Imper in 1   ireless Chain of ,Government ovriod stations has broken down;        &apos;    for.one thing, most of the Governments concerned h&amp;ye   for finnhei-I &quot;nd other reasons, abandoned the idea of erecting their own stations -r,nd have decided to leave the matter wholly or pertly to private enterprise, i.e., to the Mnrconi Company.     For another, the progress of wireless Itself has caused the conception of long-distance communication-through a chain of transmitting stations to be superseded by that of direct communication at all distances.     This has affected the situation from the point of view of initial cost by the need for higher powered stations.   It has also, from the operating point of view, made it. much more difficult to justify the demarcation between Government owned stations conducting the Imperial traffic and private,.stations dealing with the foreign traffic,     A further factor in the breakdown of the original scheme has been the delay in starting operations here which has furnished the   arconi Company with -material for an intensive campaign of propaganda on the lines that the Government has been neither able, to do anything itself nor willing to allow anyone else to do anything;Despite these considerations:, however, a good, case could still be made out for retaining Imperial wireless communication entirely in Government hands had the present and prospective .....
prospective financial situation warranted the Government in facing t&apos;-e considerable expenditure involved, not only in initial construction, but in the continual future development of a complete Imperial scheme cn&quot; a scale commensurate pith the demand for increased wireless facilities.     This solution, however., can no longer he regarded as practical-politics ;.Another possible solution of the problem would be to abandon the Original conception entirely and leave the whole business to., the &apos;*a.rponi Company either by directly ashing&apos;.them to take it over - or j what at the present moment would cpnie. to thQ-.ss.me thing, - announcing that we will give a licence to any-private firm that applies and is prepared to accept the necessary conditions.     The advantages of such as policy are that it would be cheap, for the Government at any rate if not for the public, and t*et it would probably provide a unified and fairly efficient service at an early date.    Its disadvantages have been repeatedly emphasized in previous memoranda submitted by .tbis Committee and may be summed up in the obvious fact that a commercial company must necessarily srlye first consideration to commercial rather than to Imperial interests.All the objections urged order this general heading are, however, not so much arguments against the Marconi Company conducting a commercial service as arguments in favour of some sort of competition and of the existence of a service directly under Government control for defence and other Imperial purposes,, &quot;Irele8-s is so essential to the Services that it will certainly be necessary to erect and to maintain stations ai certain Imperial strategic points, such as Aden or Singapore, which, could not be justified on commercial grounds *   And whatever mrv be said about the relative advantages of Government or commercial stations in ether parts of theEmpire,where....
where there is a sufficient volume of commercial traffic, -there is a. very strong case, on Imperial and strategical grounds, for the establishment of at any rate one Government owned long-distance station at the centre       the Empire, &quot;hile it is no doubt true that after the outbreak of another world war the whole of any private system wchid have to be taken over,  there are Undoubtedly great ad Vantages in being able to communicate in peace, more particularly -luring periods of strained relations, or&apos;in a relative!&quot; loosftlise.fi war, with the mainly strategic stations in the Empire, and with ships and airships all over the wrld, through a central Government station.     In this connection it is impossible to ignore the international affiliations rf the ivarcoftt Company and&quot; the n^sibilit- cf the effective control of the group&apos; passing into foreign, -sore particularly American, hands&apos;v     In any case, even the strongest advocate of a commercial wireless company will admit that unless there exists an element of competition Its value both to the Government and to private usors tends to become restricted. Noncommercial,stimulant is greater than competition, actual or threatened, and. under present conditions only Government action is likely to produce that competition.The practical conclusions to be drawn from these considerations are;;-(1)   That the restriction against, private enterprise in Empire traffic should be removed and. that any private company should be given a licence for long-distance communication generally subiect to appropriate conditions as to British.personnel and equipment   wave lengths, sits, control of rates, terms of expropriation, etc., (2)   That the projected Governw-^nt long-distance station in this country should be erecwed without delay.
The Government station, with the collecting machinery of the Post Office behind it, and&apos; communicating with stations all over  the world,&quot;&apos;ought to be able to obtain a fair share of traffic even in face of Marconi competition.    &apos; But If it should be&apos;involved in some loss in early years or pending a greater extension in&apos;the Use of . -Wireless, &quot;the loss will&apos;be *orth- incurring&apos;bath for reasons of&quot; imperial &quot;security and in&apos;order to keep-alive competition in the Wireless field.     It is. always possible&apos; that&apos; onc&apos;e; the decision to proceed with: the Government, station is- known-&apos;-the Marconi &quot;Company may not be in a hurry to avail itself of the right to erect a station till; it is-- sure of sufficient traffic, but the decision-on-this point&apos; will depend-largely on the importance attached by the Company to the publicity, and prestige to he attained by erectiri&apos;g&apos;:their own station in Great Britain. -&apos; Whatever the result, there-.-will be no justification, if the above recommendation Is adopted, for the criticism that the Government is either delaying itself or holding up others. &apos;   There will be a free and unfettered field for private enterprise, effective competition and &apos; &quot; &apos;. i effective safeguarding of Imperial interests. &apos;-;-*..In view of the financial situation here and of trie whole attitude of the Indian Government, it is doibtful if the proposed advance of the cost of a 120 K.W. station to India should be made.     It might also be considered whether, from the point of view of the general time table for progress with the equipment of Singapore, the erection of that station could be postponed for a short time, and enquire made as to
the possibility of the Colony bearing a portion of the cost far the commercial advantages of the station.(Signed) L.S.AMERY (Signed) L.P.BLAEDYu J.
