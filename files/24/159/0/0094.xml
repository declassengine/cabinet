3BS CQIMJHISTBIJie Control Commission appointed by the Bat terse aconference will meet on April 21st to discuss:,r(l)     The progress made ia the re-organisation of the Party &quot;in Districts and Locals,(2)    ThB effectiveness of Central and District direction of Party activities.(S)     The success of the new paper and its effect on.membershipa,rDistrict committees have been instructed to furnish reports providing the data necessary to -She discussion by the Commission, the members of which are J. Braddock, H.I, Inrpin and E.. Lismer.Tho Organising Bureau has drawn up a new monthly report form which consists of six foolscap sheets and covers questions as to membership, candidates, district congress, District Party Committee, training, organising, the Co-operative movement, trades and labour councils, local government, sale of literature, etc.It is reported, on the authority of a single informant, that the Communist Party has had a rebuff from the Agricultural Workers&apos; Union in connection with the Norfolk dispute and has bean informed that, if the Party desires to help, the best method is for it to collect money for strike pay: the Communist Party had offered to send down speakers and literature.Sylvia Pankharst was in Borfolk last week-end and states that there is a small group of her supporters there who are &quot;moved by the idea of an all labourers&apos; union of farm committees.    IHvc of them interrupted the treasurer of the Agricultural Labourers&apos; Union and held a protest meeting I1       after he had spoken on the ground that the.strike should be general./
-2- mgeneral.&quot;   &apos;Sylvia P^hkhurst Is, however, of opinion that not much action can he expected at present as &quot;those who thinkwith us are too few,&quot;The Communist Party continues to send speakers to address branches of the national Union of Eeilv.-railwaymen and as these are carefully selected their arguments, in which there Is no actual mention of oommuniaa, carry some weight.A communist who has just retained from Huesia statesthat Russian agents are extremely active in Germany atpresent and are pleased with the success so far attained:the Russian plan is to form a communist republic in Germany and then to concentrate on Great Britain.J.T. Walton lewbold has been approached by a certainBukovnik, who is at present in Ljubljana, regarding material for communist propaganda in the Kenya Colony where he is going with two &quot;comrades&quot; as colonists:   it is apparently3ukovnik&apos;s intention to educate the negroes on the principleof &quot;Africa for the blacks&quot; and he is anxious to get into touch with Billings and Claude MoJCoy, who have already been commisioned by Moscow to take charge of communist propaganda among negroes.   Moitay was in iironstadt on March16 th.Communists have been instructed to make a special point of attending Labour&apos; Party meetings for purposes of their ovax propaganda:   where they have become members they must endeavour always to secure a majority in any voting:   in one of the Islington communist groups seven of the nine members are also members of the local branch of the Labour Party,The Communist Party is considering the advisability of purchasing the printing plant of the Lithuanian Communist Federation in Great Britain:   an expert has valued the plant at  1,034-.5.0.Last week 52,000 copies of &quot;The WorkersT Weekly&quot; weresold/

The Names of these comrades are as follows:-   Watkins, Pollitt, Id oner, smith and Quelch, with discretion or power to co-opt as many more as we considered-necessary, since our return, however, a letter from the E.C. states that Comrade Tom Mann should function as Chairman, and Smiths name wss omitted from the list, as Campbell will have informed you that the i meetings of the Bureau are chiefly confined to themembers in London, due entirely of course to the financial disabilities which we have to contend with all along the line.   Personally I am acting as National Secretary, as responsible for the financial and business Transactions of the Bureau.   Smith is secretary of the London Committee, and looks after the distribution of the paper, circulars, and paper accounts, also addressing Branch and mass meetings.   Quelch edits &quot;All power&quot; and renders assistance in drafting such circulars as we require from time to time,   pollitt and Lismer, of course, devote the whole of their time to Party work, Pollitt I understand is fully occupied with the Distribution of the &quot;Workers&quot; Weekly&quot;, and Party Committee work.       Lismer is party Organiser in the Yorkshire area, but devotee some time to addressing Branch meetings in the Sheffield, district on behalf of the R.I.L.U.     Mann is endeavouring to fix up engagements for the coming months by which he can obtain some kind of a living.   Well I think this disposes of the above question fairly  fully...&quot;One thing is certain that we shall certainly have to concentrate upon the question of raising funds, to carry on our work in future, a committee will have to be formed for this purpose, who will consider ways and means of collecting finance for publicity work, and also for organising work as well.&quot;I am forwarding my last contribution to the Worker to-day until I am able to secure a further allocation, if this is possible, I think it is possible, but am not certain, I am going to Germany this week to meet the Central European Bureau on the matter and to state the position as baldly and as bluntly as may be necessary to convince them of the desperate need for assistance in this country at this juncture, of course I regret my inability to follow it up, and no stone will be left unturned to secure the necessary supply to forward along as per usual, so cheerio, perhaps when the clouds are darkest the dawn may appear more quickly and bright.
-   -(N.B.   -   On April 4th the usual weekly subsidy of  6 waOent to the editor of &quot;The Worker.&quot;)The Mid-European Bureau Of the Rod International ofLabour Unions, in accordance with its usual interest in labour disputes in this oountry has sent the following cctarnunlcationto the British Bureau:&quot;As we read in the press a big strike of Landworkers, in whioh more than fifty thousand, men participate, has broken out in Norfolk some days ago with the object to put a stop to the formidable reductions of wages which has gone on now against the English Landworkers since more than a year.&quot;We are very anxious to hear more from you about this movement.   Have you in any way actively Intervened in it?&quot;Has aoemrade been specially designed by you to carry out the work among the Land-labourers?   Is any reliably comrade engaged in the conflict in Norfolk itself, who is able to co-ordinate and lead those men or groups sympathising with our platform?  What is the attitude of the National Union of Agricultural Workers towards this strike?   If we are well Informau, the mass of workers organised in this Union and also its leader, R.B. Walker are belonging to the left wing of the Trade Union Movement in Britain.&quot;Wc urgently request you to use all your influence in order to participate actively in this movement and to advise us as econ. as possible on the steps you have taken.11Mosoow has decided to give effect to its view that shipping constitutes a key industry and the British Bureau is in consequence particularly active among seamen:   Tom Bell is tabulating all the available information regarding tha payment and conditions of this body of workers.   Hamburg is an important centra for this branch of Red International of Laboiu&apos; Union  propaganda and a man named John Campbell, who went to Russia as general secretary of the Australian Railway Workers and was recently in Rotterdam in connection with work among seamen has now gone to Humburg where he is organising the &quot;Anglo-Aiaerican weamen&apos;y union&quot;.As a result of a meeting in Poplar Town Ho-21 on February
THE YOUNG COMUHIbT LEAGUEThe Executive of the Young Communist International is apparently disturbed by the report of the delinquencies of. Redfsrn and his associates at LamVa Conduit Street and, in asecret communication dated Moscow, Maroh 2nd informed theCommunist Party of Great Britian that:&quot;Our representative, Comrade Young, has sent us rather unfavourable reports with regard to conditions prevailing in the U.E.C. of the Y.C.L.     The situation appears to be so serious that we think it neoessary to appeal to you with the request to intervene.   The situation that seems to prevail at present oannot be tolerated, nor can we allow of a repetition of such things as seem to occur regularly in the N.E*C* of the La ague.&quot;Wo have decided to call the secretary, Comrade Redfern, to Berlin, where our representatives will have a serious conversation with him.   We enclose a copy of the letter to the M.E.G. of the League and also a copy of the letter to Comrade Young touching on the same matter.&quot;We are of the opinion that Comrade Redfern cannot be considered as delegate to the Enlarged Executive Seeuion of the Comintern, and thst this veto is to be held against him as a disciplinary measure.   We have sent Comrade Young special instructions regarding the delegation for the Session.&quot;We &quot;25th, 3923, at which George H*rdj- was present, an &quot;Indian Seamen&apos;b Association in Great Britain end Ireland&quot; has been formed:   its immediate aim is a united &quot;All Intiia Seaaen&apos;s Union&quot; vith affiliation to the Re a International of Labour Unions, the ultimate object being one united &quot;Internotional Seafarers&apos; Union&quot; affiliated to the Bed International of Labour Unions:    a manifesto regarding the necessity for propaganda work among Indians has been drawn up:   in this document it is asserted that seamen should be organised as a olase irrespective of colour or creed.J.R. Wilson, the secretary-organiser of the South Wales Communist Divisional Council has approached 3,0. Davies with a view to co-ordination of Communist party.and Bed International of Labour Union   activities in his area.
THE UNEMPLOYEDA well informed Communist states that Moscow regards the organised unemployed as tha future Red Army of Great Britain and follows the activities of the National Unemployed workers&apos; Committee Movement with the greatest attention:   all literature issued by that body is in future to be Bent to the archives in Petrograd:   from the Smolny Institute, Penrograd, has emanated the suggestion that if the unemployed inarch to London this autumn they should endeavour to seiae Government buildings by way of preparation for the revolution.Full reports of the national conference of the organised unemployed at Coventry, at which the plarafor this  march were to be discussed have not yet heen reoeived, but it ishoped/&quot;Wo request that you send us immediately a report on the actual situation and on the conditions in the N.E.C. of the League.&quot;The Executive has also informed the writer of the adverseoritlclsm quotea in Report No. 198, that;&quot;We have discussed your letter and have come to the following conclusions:   The conditions you depict cannot he tolerated in the N.E.C. of a communist organisation.   Wo have also expressed this opinion in a let&apos;1-.or to tho N.E.C. of the party, a copy of which we enclose, herewith.   But for the lack of c ah ah lei comrades, we would not hesitate for a minute to adopt the strictest of measures.   Comrades who behave in tho manner described by you are not worthy to load an organisation which has for its aim the introduction of a now system of soolety; hut! should he expelled therefrom.   This is quite obvious.    As   j however, conditions in England are suoh as to ronfler such measures Impossible without weakening still farther the already weal: League, you should discuss the situation with the party and together with it take tho necessary (and possible) steps to remedy the existing state of affairs.&quot;The conduct of the comrades in question is simply irresponsible and we agree with you that one oannot be secretary of a Young Communist League and at the same time get insensibly drunic.&quot;Moved by these considerations we have decided that C. should immediately leave for Borlln;   firstly in order to get him away from his present surroundings and secondly to give him a good talking to here.   Some of us will he in Berlin at the beginning of April where they will have a serious conversation with C.   Under no circumstances can we tolerate a continuation of that state of affairs...&quot;
hoped that they will he available lor next week&apos;B report.Some progress seems to have been made for the celebration of May Day in London ana, according to present arrangement^ contingents will march to Eyfie park from Bermondsey, C&amp;mbarwsll, Deptford, Greenwich, Lambeth, Lewisham, peckham, Southwark and Woolwich.Tho Oonraranls1 Party is sparing no effort to secure representatives on fey Day platforms throughout the country,IRISH BB70IJTICMRY ACTIVITIES IN GREAT BRITAIE1Tiiere is a dearth of news from Irish Republican centres in this country.   The Irish Self-Determination League has not yet recovered from the blow inflicted by the deportation of so many of its leaders, and the minor lights i        appear quite unable to arouse enthusiasm in the rank and file.The London District Committee decided at its last meeting to keep no record of its doingss   but to replace the usual minute book by notes on scraps of paper.   Joseph )?ow&quot;ler of Twickenham and P vriok McB;ide of Rtmwell have temporarily been elected President and Secretary.Rumours of reprisals to take the form of attacks on prominent police officials anr; destruction of public property have been plentiful but have come to nothing.&quot;O/C Britain&quot; is still in hiding and apparently without any regular line of communication,   a regular courier service   being rather too expensive a luxury in the present state of depleted funds.   Generally speaking the very subduing effect produced by the deportations has not yet won: off,Dociwionts captured yesterday in Ireland show thattho recent deportations entirely disorganised the irish republican Army in this country, and completely upset their plans/
plans.a few public meetings, none of them very important, to protest against the deportations have taken place. Most of thorn were in the Midlands where something like an entente with the Communists has been established.A  3: srJent&apos;s jlund is being raised in London but in Scotland the wives and other near relatives of the Deportees are being advised to claim Parish Relief.   The Republican Organisation in Scotland is in a bad way financially and its national Executive Council is sending out an urgent appeal for funds.Evidently things are going from bad to worse with the Republicans:   all reports go to show that in Ireland the rebel army is rapidly breaking up and cannot last many more months.   Peace rumours are numerous and persistent, and well informed Irishmen think the trouble is nearly over.On April 3rd three masked men with revolvers, held up and bound two night watchmen at the Glasgow Corporation Housing Works, Annie si and, esnd stole a quantity of gelignite Practically all of it was recovered by the local Poiioo, who also arrefttefi three men in connection with the robbery. One of them.  John Gfelicgher, was included in the list for deportt/oion but escaped arrest at the time :   another, Frederick Farroll, or Farren, is Captain of &quot;A&quot; Company, Glasgow Irish Republican Army and the third, Denis Breslin,&apos; is in euuia-ad cf the Fianna, or Boy&apos;s Scouts&apos; Section of the
APPENDIXSTRIKE OF AGRICULTURAL WORKERS IN NOKFOIK.&apos;jQao following report, dated April 11th, has just heenreceived from the Chief Donstahle of Norfolk:-&quot;?or the first week the Strike was confined to an area lying between Marham, Castleacra, Massinghara, Eakenham and Walsingham, with detached Strikes between Dereham and Wymondham.   There were some 1,500 men out but there was very little intimidation attempted.     The Papers said there were 10,000 out,   I waB able to deal with the Strikers by drafting in my own men from peaceful areas.&quot;... On the -27th March, however, matters took a turn for the worse, as gangs of youths on cycles began to invade farms to get men, who were still working, out.    On Easter Monday, a gang of about 150 youths on oyclee invaded Mr. Henry Overman&apos;e farm to stop bis Federation men from working.   . they then attacked 3 others farms round this..part, rather severely injuring one man and slightly injuring about 4 more.men who were still working, yet that afternoon one of my men turned this gang off a farm.   &quot;      &apos;- ,The Strike broke out on the. 29th March south of Horwioh round Sweinsthorpe, Mulbarton, Hethel and also Harleston way, but these latter men returned to work  &apos; after three days.Up to Easter Monday, as long as I had a Constable on a farm or following a gang, the men abstained from going on the farms.    But they now changed their methods. &apos;J!hey arranged that gangs of anything from 30 to 300 men would collect at some point from villages 5 to 10 miles away and then raid farms, taking no notice of a Constable who might be present, and fetched men out from work, but in most cases did no Injury other than setting horses free from carts or harrows and upsetting the oarts, etc.    As they came from a distance neither the farmers, labourers, or Police, had any idea who the strikers were and it was impossible for one or two Constables to prevent such large numbers going on the farms.I then arranged for groups of my men to follow bodies of strikers, but the strikers, then broke up and met again later on at some arranged spot and invaded the pre-arranged farm.Jiast Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, matters got worse. Strikers from Walsingham fetohed all the men out on a large number of farms at Wells, Titohwell and Brancaster way and others were organised from Aylsham to spread the strike up to and around North Walsham.   Cases of assault became more numerous.   I therefore decided on ?riday to get extra Polioe help as I had no more men to put into the strike area.On Monday I got In 170 men from various local Forces and on Tuesday got in 100 from the west Riding and to-day emgetting^
getting 20 more from Hertfordshire.I have placed these men in bodies of 15 to 25 at various places over the Strike area where I can billet them. Each group has a closed motor lorry in whioh they oan be rushed to any spot where we either hear a raid is about to be attempted or towards which a gang is advancing, my own men aotxug as scouts on cycles.   I think this plan is working fairly well ana having a marked effect, but owing to the paucity of telephones in the country districts it is difficult as a rule to get word of a raid in time to get Polioe to the spot.   But the faot of this Police support being about is tending to get the men back to work.   I firmly believe 705? to 75$ of the strikers want to get back but are kept from doing so by fear and intimidation.So far we have had no case of arson and only one reported of damage to farm premises and that oonaiots of a door smashed off its hinges.   Only one or two fanners have ; been actually struck, but there have been a good many cases of workers being molested but no savere injuries.   The farmers, in some parts, particularly round W&amp;lsingham, Massingham and between Aylaham and North W&amp;lsham, ate baaly soared and their families too, but so far, I think, without any real oause, as the feeling of the large bulk of the strikers is friendly to the farmers.   They know the farmers are up against it and incapable of paying a decent wage.A^ain, I think, three-quarters of the farmers whose men are out now, never served any notices on their men to change the hours.Farmers and their families go about alone and their has been no case of assault except where strikers are actually raiding a farm.3* Bunaon, the Organising Seoretary, ana R.B. Walker, are the chief firebrands at the top.   Old George Edwards, late M*P., one of their oldest leaders, tries his best to prevent man going on to the farms to intimidate.I am informed that a communist, called William Alfred Pask, Red lion Street, Aylsham, is tho man who ie organising all the raids round Ajdbhara way from an office in Aylfeham, but I have no proof so far...,   As you see this Strike is unlike any previous one an3 is rather difficult to handle owing to the wide area concerned, tha number of villagee ana farms and scarcity of telephones.&quot;
