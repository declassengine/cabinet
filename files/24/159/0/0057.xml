&quot;...      w *(This Document is the property of His Britannic,Majesty&apos;&apos;s. Government, )g BORE Tt CABINET..g.P.  157 (25). . T&quot;-&quot;: THE CARLISLE STATE MANAGEMENT DISTRICT.Memorandum by the Home Secretary,1. In view of the probability of Parliamentary pressure, itseems desirable that the Government should consider in good time what policy they will adopt in regard to the continuance of the &quot;Carlisle Experiment&quot;,   The position is as follows.. v2i The Licensing Act,  1921, g&amp;ve power to the Home secretary and the Secretary for Scotland to1 continue &quot;until Parliament otherwise determines&quot;, the State Management of the liquor trade in the four areas in which the dentral Control Board hadLinstituted Ideal schemes of state Purchase and Management, Viz; the districts of Carlisle^ Enfield Lock, Croraarty Firth, and ,Gretna*i   0? the two -English undertakings, .that at Enfield Lock has already been disposed of (under Mr. Shortt&apos;s instruc-tions), and although the somewhat different position in which Scotland, stands with regard to drink legislation may at some stages introduce special considerations in regard to the two-. , Scottish di6trictB, the broad aspects of the general problem are so fully represented by the Carlisle distriot, and that district is so much the largest of the three, that the brunt of any Parliamentary attack, at any rate in the first instance, will probably have to be borne by Carlisle. 3. The Attorney General (then Sir Gtrdon Hewart), in introducing and defending the Licensing Bill of 1921, which was based generally on tho agreed recommendations of a Round Table Conference, was at pains to omphasize.that,.as the Conference had not propounded any permanent settlement of the problem presented by the State ownership of the liquor trade.in these
. . -2- 458ar-eas, the Bill. expressly authorised the continuance, of the Stato Management schemes only &quot;until Parliament otherwise doterminec&quot;.The position is complicated by the fact that, apart frcm tho question of how far the schome is acceptable in the locality and a source of profit to the State,  the continuance of the scheme has the appearance of being the thin ond cf the wedge of a.more extended, or even of a general, adoption of the policy of State Purchase of the liquor trade.   As such, it naturally excites the hostility alike, of prohibitionists and *f a large and active section of the &quot;Trade&quot;, and these opponents seek to re-inforce themselves by enlisting the support of the much larger body of public opinion which is opposed to nationalisation of trade and industry in any form.The Carlisle district consists of the city of Carlisle and a strip of North-west Cumberland roughly 30 miles long by 10 miles broad.   Within this area the State possesses (subject t*.-certain qualifications) the virtual monopoly cf the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors   It operates the flnly brewery, and owns and manages some 200 licensed premises (hotels, public houses, and wine-merchantsr establishments).The material assets of the undertaking (premises, plant, stocks, etc.) stand in the last Balanoe Sheet (31 March 1922) at nearly  1,000,000i   They have^been provided partly out of profits, and partly by advances from the Exchequer^    The net amount of these advances, including interest to date, stood at 31 March 1922 at about  400,000*    The undertaking, after making/ full provision for depreciation and all usual trading charges, including taxes (except income Tax (Schedule D,) and Corporation Profits Tax), has an annual net profit surplus (i.e, a surplus additional tc the sum required&apos;for interest on the outstanding. Exchequer advances) which fluctuates between a figure in the neighbourhood of  100,000 in a good year and about half that
-3- ^ M Or-amount in a bad one ( 60,000 in 1921-22)..   The, Geddes Committee, \ttiich reported-somewhat disparagingly on the financial position If the scheme, but without having heard evidence from,those directly concerned;with its administration, suggested the&apos; ^risk of loss in future years&quot;,as a ground for giving up the Scheme.   It seems1 fair, however, to say that the margin .of -profit even in bid years is such that this riBk is negligible, and that the retiirh upon the Btate^ invested capital is , greater.than the revenue which could be obtained as the result If a sale of the. properties.&apos; :iThe financial position, as at the 31st March, .1922, s-? far as the Exchequer is concerned,., was as followsThe total cash advances by the Exchequer, up to the above-mentioned date,&quot; amounted tcl  737,642? 6i 3 and repayments totalling  449,448! 11: 6 haire been made for the same period, leaving a net cash indebtedness of  288,193: 14: 9. enly.   This figure,, with interest charges totalling      y.&apos;  98,807: 7: 4 for the whole period (at rates varying from 5 to 7 per oent), represents the   total of the Outstanding Exchequer Issues as shewn &apos;in the Carlisle Accounts (387,001: 2: 1). (Print annexed)..Por the current financial year (1922/23), .  100 only has been voted by Parliament for,the carrying on of the State Management Distriots ahd over  100,000.has accrued to the Exchequer from the Carlisle Undertaking since&apos; 31 March 1922, ff. which  93,000 odd has actually been paid over in reduction *f the above-mentioned cash indebtedness of  288,,193: 14.:-9.It&quot; is expected that the &quot;net profit surplus&quot; -will not differ materially for the year 1922/23 from that shown for 19.21/22 viz:  60,616t ,0: 8 (See paragraph 6). ,,In addition to the financial argument that the State is getting a good return upon, its money,, and that a sale, and particularly anything in the nature of a fcreed sale, would be
-4- 46.0comparatively-unprofitable, -there are substantial grounds on the social and practical sides for leaving things as they are.   A high standard of sobriety is being maintained throughout the district., a sustained object-lessen is being afforded of the oonstrubtioh and working of public houses of &quot;improved&quot; type, and the state is getting a useful inside knowledge of questions of licensing law. and liquor taxation.   Most important of allj responsible public opinion in the area appears to be decidedly in favour of the continuance of the scheme, at least aB against any alternative which hae yet been suggested in any quarter. It is true that there have been indications of a feeling (which there was some attempt to exploit at the recent General Election) that the-locality will not be. content to remain indefinitely under a system which differentiates it from the whole of the rest of England,   At the same time,  there are good grounds for anticipating that local opinion would resent and oppose any attempt to hand the trade back into private ownership over their headsIndeed, somewhat serious practical difficulties arise when the question of what to substitute for the present system is faced.    In the first place,  the justices&apos; licences previously attached to the properties have lapsed, and legislation would therefore be required to enable an incoming owner to run them as licensed premises.    In the   second place, any method of disposal, whether a sale by auction or by private treaty, or a scheme established bji Parliament, must cover the whole undertaking, since it would clearly never do either on financial or on other, more important grounds for the State to remain in partial possession over an extended or indefinite period of transition,   Municlpalisation might seem to-be a solution of this last^mentioned difficulty; but nunioipalisation would do nothing.to pacify the most active enemies of the existing system, while it would introduce fresh dangers peculiar to itself.   But whatever form of new ownership were proposed, the State, as representing the tax-payer, would have
9F.32-e...  tw-aim at - getting-ftO.1,value- for its property, and any scheme which proposed either a limitation, of dividend, on Public H*use Trust Company lines, or any local contrel on behalf of : the public, would tend to diminish the capital sum which prospective purchasers, whether Trust Companies, or commercial firms1 or syndicates, would be disposed to offer.Ill While, therefore, the political weight of the objectionto State-trading in liquor^ or tfe the continuance so long after the war ef any war-time venture in&apos;State-trading, must be fully admitted, it may be suggested that in this particular case the balance of advantage lies in leaving things for the present as they are.   It would seem to be a reasonable position that, in the absence of any generally acceptable alternative plan, or indeed of any substantial demand for change *n the part of these most concerned, the Government should not add t* the legislative programme of the Session proposals for re-opening the temporary settlement of 18 months ago, at the risk of involving themselves in controversies extending over many other aspects of the drink question,IS. To summarise, I invite the agreement of the Cabinet withthe view that matters should be left as they are at any rate during the present year on the grounds.(a) that the present would be a very bad time for the sale of the property,(b) that any legislation on tihe subject would be highly controversial.W. 0.
