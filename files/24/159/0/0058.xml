V      ,CABINET.IMPERIAL CONFERENCE .AN.D IMPERIAL ECONOMIC CONFERENCE.Memorandum by the : S egketary of :- State -for !The Colonies.AT the ,yvish.: of the . Prime Minister, I circulate to my colleagues. copies of , the telegrams sent after -the -Cabinet. decision on the 28th February (see C.P.&apos;.l.-J8/23 and Cabinet Minutes 13&apos;(2,3)..-);and,the replies received. The latter at-e now couiplete,. except as regards Newfoundland. A despatch,to the Irish Free.State is,ready for transmission, but for the:time beingL am.suspending it.It will be seen from the replies that there is general ,.agreement that both Conferences should be held, :if possible, in the autumn of this year (except that New Zealand cannot be represented at the Prime Ministers&apos;&apos; Conference), but that there is some divergence of view as to dates. South Africa presses for a .commencing date not later -than the ,1st September, and both Canada and India ask i that the date:may not i be later than the 1st October.There seem to be only two.courses open :-1. To arrange for both Conferences to be held this year, but-to begin at an earlier date than the 1st November ; or 2. To postpone both until next year.On the whole I think that the former course would be preferable, as considerable interest in the proposed - Conferences has already been shown Loth here and in the Dominions, and postponement now would cause disappointment.If my colleagues agree In -this view, I should propose, before -a final i decision is taken (a.) To ascertain by telegram whether General Smuts would agree to the Conferences commencing in the very early days of October.I would explain that this date would suit the convenience of all the other Dominions and India as far as we can gather (except that Mr. Massey will not be able to attend the Conference of Prime Ministers), and would be much more acceptable to the Cabinet here.(b.) To let Mr. Bruce know that the other Dominions and India have accepted the suggestion for two separate Conferences and press him to agree.I should propose, however, to put to Mr. Bruce, in the event of his agreement, the desirability of his arranging to be accompanied on his visit by at least one of his colleagues, on the ground that we fear that his undertaking the work of two Conferences single-handed would result in an almost intolerable strain.(Signed)        DEVONSHIRE.Colonial Office,March 20, 1923.Enclosure.Telegram to Viceroy, Commerce Department, dated March 2, 1923.891. Following telegram has been sent by Prime Minister to Prime Minister of Dominions, and I am accordingly sending it to you.   Begins: - . . .   Ends.As it is out of the question to hold these Conferences in the summer, do you see any objection to the 1st November being fixed ? This might have the advantage of [9692]
enabling a delegate or delegates attending the Assembly at Geneva to be appointed to represent India at one or other of these Conferences, the month.of October being spent in London in preparation.Telegram from Viceroy, Commerce Department, to Secretary of State for India.(Received 9 a.m., March 12, 1923.) &apos;&apos;; &quot;   &apos;      &apos;&apos;Delhi, March 11, 1923. We have received your telegram No. 891 of the 2nd March, which foreshadows the holding this year of an Imperial Conference in addition to the Imperial Economic Conference.2. We have already represented to you in our telegram of the 8th December that, whilst we are very desirous to approach the Imperial Economic Conference in the most helpful spirit possible, considerations may easily arise at it which may prove very difficult for us. We therefore consider that we ought [?] only to be represented at it by the best men we can spare, on whom we can rely as knowing at first hand the conditions and feeling in India, and able also to explain and maintain them. Oh this occasion the proposed date, 1st November, is most inconvenient to us. In that case, our representative would in all probability not return to India till January or later. The new session of our Legislature will open in early January, and we shall he seriously embarrassed, in dealing with newly-elected Legislative Assembly, if our representatives do not return some weeks before January. Thus, whilst we wish to assist, we would strongly urge that the Economic Conference open latter half September or, at the latest, on 1st October.3. The proposal to hold concurrently an Imperial Conference strengthens our opinion, as, though it may ultimately prove helpful to have Prime Ministers at hand to refer to, the need for dovetailing in, on certain occasions, the sittings of two Conferences must tend to prolong the Economic Conference.4. Subjects usually discussed at the League of Nations are not such as seem to us to require attendance of Prime Ministers or of representatives who would normally represent their countries at an Imperial Economic Conference. We therefore hope that the meeting of the League of Nations may not be allowed to affect the date fixed for the Imperial Conference.5. In the past India&apos;s representation, at an Imperial Conference has formed the subject of personal telegrams. I presume that this will be dealt with separately, but a date earlier than. 1st November would, for similar reasons, suit us better.6. We would ask you, therefore, to use your best endeavours to get the proposed date advanced as suggested by us and to advise us as soon as possible.

Telegram.(Canada.)(Commonwealth of Australia.)(New.; Zealand.)(Union of South Africa.)(Newfoundland.)28th February. Following from Prime Minister, for your Prime Minister : Begins: Answers to my message of 29th November^ as to suggested Imperial Economic Conference now complete, and I find that it is generally agreed that it would be of advantage to hold such a Conference. I gather, however, that there is a feeling that the best results would not be achieved if an Economic Conference were held independently of a Conference of Prime Ministers, and therefore that it would be best to hold Imperial Economic Conference and a meeting of the Imperial Conference concurrently.Prime Ministers present at the latter would thus be enabled to be in con-stant consultation with their colleagues who were taking part in the former, ancl, if necessary, could themselves attend the most important meetings of the Economic Conference.This procedure would be quite in accordance with views of Cabinet here, and for myself I should greatly welcome opportunity of discussing this year with my fellow Prime Ministers the many urgent problems of foreign policy and defence which confront us.As to dates, it would be impossible to make necessary preparations before June at earliest, and the answers to my message of 29th November indicate that meeting in autumn would be preferred.We accordingly suggest that both Conferences should open about 1st November, 1923, in London.Please let me know as soon as you can whether you agree to holding both Conferences concurrently, and whether time suggested will suit you.As to agenda for Economic Conference we would send you as soon as possible detailed list of subjects suggested for discussion.As to agenda for Imperial Conference, our idea would be that arrange-ments should follow generally those for 1921 Conference.Similar telegram sent to other Prime Ministers.;  Ends.

COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA, The SECRETARY OF STATE to the GOVERNOR-GENERAL. (Sent 7.0 p.m., 28th February, 1923.)    &apos; Telegram.My telegram of 28th February. * Following from Prime Minister for yourPrime Minister : Begins: Many thanks for your telegram of 24th February,t as to Economic and Imperial Conferences. I am answering it in my message of to-day, but I feel bound to make clear to you position of present British Government on tariff question. I announced before election that this Parlia-ment would not make any fundamental change in the fiscal system of this country, and pledge, has since been repeated several times in Parliament here. Hence, when discussing any proposals put forward with regard to preference, our attitude would necessarily be governed by this pledge. This will not, however, prevent you from raising the subject, but I feel sure that you will agree that a broad policy of economic co-operation such as we hope to realize must include much that is not fiscal, and I am confident that proposed Economic Conference could do useful work in many directions.

Your telegram 28th February.*   Following from PrimeMinister for your Prime Minister : Begins: Prime Ministers and Economic Conferences. I agree to your . proposal to hold.both Conferences concurrently. 1st November is, however, quite unsuitable date for Union to attend Conference as Parliament Session begins shortly afterwards. 1st September at latest would be suitable date, and I understand Australia also would prefer to meet earlier than November. Postponement to 1st November would make it practically impossible for Union to attend either Conference, and in that case I would prefer postpone-ment till summer of next year. Ends. Above represents utmost effort on the part of my Ministers to fall in with yourprogramme, and I am personally aware that they would much prefer to meet earlier than 1st September, which is absolutely latest date they could manage.

Following from my Prime Minister : Beyins: Your, telegram 28th February^ in which you refer to fiscal pledges given by your Government, I fully understand the position you are placed in.by reason of. pledges referred to. These pledges, however, would not debar you from assenting to some of proposals my Government would submit. They would not involve any fundamental change, in your fiscal system, or in your maximum tariff rate. For example, where preference at present exists in favour of the Dominions, such preference could be increased. While such assistance, if it could be accorded by&apos; Britain, will be welcomed by Australia, it must be recognized that even this does not exhaust all that we consider should be done to ensure proper economic organization of Empire, and I will in this connexion of necessity raise further points at Conference.I await receipt of agenda, and strongly urge meantime British Govern-ment to consider what definite proposals they intend to put forward in exchange for maintenance of, or increase in, present preference granted by Dominion to British goods.  -Ends.

PROOF.11788No.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA. The GOVERNOR-GENERAL to the SECRETARY OF STATE. ^Received 5.23 p.ra., 5th March, 1923.) Telegram.5th March. Following from my Prime Minister : Begins: Your telegram of 28th February.* So far as can be ascertained at this juncture, the suggested date for the Imperial and Economic Confer -ences quite satisfactory.As intimated in my telegram of the 24th February, f consider if two separate conferences intended they should take place simultaneously. How-ever, I am strongly of the opinion that the best results would be achieved by dealing with economic subjects as part of the Imperial Conference. So far as I can tell at present, I shall not be accompanied by any of my colleagues, and even if delegation of more than one could be arranged, the wide range of subjects suggested in your&apos; telegram of 29th November,^ covering shipping, technical research, unification of laws, taxation, etc., could hardly be dealt with effectively by anyone but the head of the Government. Difficulty of hold-ing such a conference separately and concurrently appears to me to be insuperable-able; deliberation probably would be unduly prolonged and no finality reached. At best Conference could emerge with recommendations only, which would, have-to be then considered as such at meetings of Prime Ministers.While thoroughly agreeing with you that Economic Conference very desirable, and an Imperial Conference necessary, I certainly do not want to undertake long and arduous journey unless some practical results are to be achieved. I suggest, therefore, for your serious consideration, that Economic proposal(s) should be considered at meeting of Imperial Conference. This would considerably shorten discussion, and probably result in definite con-clusions being arrived at. Ends. &apos; Governor-General .* No. 9925. t No. 9925.J No. 58204.

Reference to personal message from Mr. Bonar Law transmitted in your telegram of 28th February^ my Prime Minister has informed me that much as lie regrets the fact he cannot -see the slightest chance of his being able to leave New Zealand either for the Imperial or Economic Conference, owing to the difficulties connected with the present political situation. He adds that in his opinion it would be futile for any other representative than the Prime Minister to act on behalf of the Dominion at the Imperial Conference, although probably might be possible to arrange for suitable representation at any Economic Conference which it might be considered desirable to hold.

As for the time we: are most anxious that both of these Conferences should begin not later than 1st October; later date than this would greatly inconvenience preparation for next winter session of Parliament. We should be glad to receive proposed Agenda for Economic Conference, and,; if possible, some more-definite indica-tion of subjects for discussion at Conference of Prime Ministers.  Ends.
