7/ . su[jrgli/%QJ3JMEHT IS THE PROPEBTY OF HIS:; BSITAOTIC. MA:JE,STYrS COlGRDMSrTl) .0 PI-0 A B I H E I.cp. 1B2 f23).&quot;&apos; gEBORT OF THE COMMITTEE.ON IRAQ. ; &quot;  &quot; : r- 1 &apos; t;--Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.,,, on C-Pcl6&apos;7(23);I.am in agreement with the,main recommendations of the Committee.   It seems that, hp to a certain point,&apos;the problem is very simple1.     We want to be1 relieved of the burden of Mesopotamia and *t the responsibility of its administration and the Arabs want us to go.     Moreover, as to the plan reoommended in the Report of carrying out this ohjeot I have no oritioism to offer.     The method by which the frontier is to be delimitated is a very good method, namely, by submission to the decision of the League of. nations, and the diplomacy b,y whioh the Turks were induced to regard with favour this solution was admirable.,     Further I have no comment to offer as to the other &quot;conditions of the withdrawal.     no doubt it oannot be carried out in a day.     Four years seem a not un-reasonable period for its completion..     Its gradual character is convenient and workable.    In short it fulfils the two essential conditions - respect for.the pledges of the Government and regard to the interests of the inhabitants.But though this plan is straightforward enough1 the carrying out of a policy founded upon it is not quite so easy. In the&quot; first, place though we are, anxious to be gone it would-be unacceptable that this should be effected by our being turned out by the Turks.     In the second place not only must we not be turned out but if and when wo go it, is most undesirable thatthe...
the Juris should occupy--the &quot;place&apos; we liave&apos;&apos; vacated-   It the worst &apos;;fcbis might &quot;be the preface to the reappearance of the .Turlts;.::at/. Baghdad and even at Basrah&apos;, and at the best it would mean that we&apos; r.Ms&apos;t;: resign- .&apos;a&apos;l.I&quot;oonhection- with&apos;. Mesopotamia.t since if ue were, to ,leave British officials, in the employ of the Iran&apos; Government, as,.is. suggested,, it would be out of the question that we should risk having- thera disestablished and possibly slaughtered by tho triumphant&apos;-Turks&apos;. &apos; &quot;It is therefore a prerequisite - which I need not say &quot;is indicated by the Committee - that a condition precedent to the beginning ofour evacuation is that the Turks should have bound themselves&apos; *- -   - ...... .-:- -, .&apos;,-to recognise the independence of Iraq.    It is in this connect-ion that I venture to trouble the Cabinet&quot;because the proposal which has been made to us is not merely that the plan of the&apos;Committee should be the accepted policy of the Government, butthat we should publish it;.   and. it is as to the advisability of this that I have the greatest- doubts,,     what effect would this publication have upon the prospect of the Turks signingan instrument which recognises the independence of Iraq?I suggest that once they know that we have made up bur mindsdefinitely to leave Mesopotamia thoy will&apos; begin&apos; to reconsider the settlement of tho frontier to which they are committing themselves, and they will come;;to the conclusion that once&apos; - &apos;, -. .     . ........... . - ... . -. -.............     &apos; ......       ......  .     .... i.  ...we have publicly formulated a definite plan of getting rid ofthis burden, opinion will force us to.go through with it, and that if they obstruct with-sufficient Turkish perseverance&apos; thoy will have their opportunity of re,-ontoring into all that they loot as the result of the war.,   jt.would surely then bo better from a diplomatic point of.view to say nothing about the arrangements for evacuation until wo have got the signatur of the Turks safe.Is..
Is there any reason why we should not adopt this policy namely accept the&apos; Report of the Committee so that Sir Percy Cox may know what is in front of him. hut keep it a secret?     It is said that in fairness we must let Jeisul know.    Coxbainly, if he can be trusted.   And why should ho not be trusted?   It is manifestly even more in his interests than in our own that nothing should bo said until the Turks hare entered into a binding engagement,    The only other reason against secrecy of which I am aware is the alleged necessity of meeting the demands of British opinion.   Upon this I cannot speak with any confidence but I - cannot help believing that the Houso of Commons will quite understand that the obvious order of proceedings is, first the Turkish Treaty and&apos; afterwards the arrangements for evacuation, and that they will bo quite reasonable on this head even if tho Turkish signature Is delayed till the Autumn.   In any case it is a dangerous principle of policy to bo guided by unreasonable public opinion.I think there is an additional reason against public at-ion defending on the role of the League of nations in the Committee&apos;s plan which I put in the background because it is probably not of the ossenoe of the scheme.   The Committee pro-pose we should secure the termination of the mandate by obtain-ing the admission of Iraq to the League:.   I speak with hesi-tation because I am not familiar with the practice of the League,    But are we quite sure there will be no difficulties in the way of this admission,?   o,.g,, the League must apparently be satisfied that Iraq has a stable Government.-   Unless wo arc suvo I suggest that in addition to other reasons submitted in this -paper it would be rash to publish a policy containing this provision.(IntdJ    S. .1 5th, 1923,,
