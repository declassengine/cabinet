This Document is the property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government. JHE2 CAB I I E I.,170 (23)llote by the First lord of the Admiralty.   -With, reference, to the Iota CP.160 ( 23), circiilatsd by the Secretary to the Cabinet by direction of the Prime Minister, I desire to make the following observations.From my experience as Civil Commissioner in 1920 and as Chief Civil Commissioner since 1921, I agree that the organisation should be retained in some form and that it should be linked, as proposed, with the Home Office.     There seems, however, to be some misapprehension as regards the &quot;Chief Civil Commissioner&quot; and the &quot;Civil Commissioners1 Department&quot; (formerly called the &quot;Supply Department&quot;), the latter not even being referred to.The post of Chief Civil Commissioner is a Ministerial one made on the. appointment oi the prime Minister, and it naturally follows that the holder should be a member of the Supply and Transport Committee, that is, a Cabinet Committee.Apart from the post of Chief Civil Commissioner, the Civil Commissioners1 Department is an integral, and in my view, essential part of the emergency organisation.That Department has been responsible since March 1920, not only for maintaining throughout the, country.....
country the organisation of Volunteer Service chairmen and Committees for obtaining volunteers for national and local services and cooperating with the Looal Autboritihut also for co-ordinating information as to the emergency measures of all Government Departments for the use of CivilCommissioners,,The Official whc has acted sinoe Maroh0 19^0, as Secretary tc the Civil Commissioners1 Department and Chief of Staff to the Chief Civil Commissioner, is actually a General Inspector of the Ministry of Health; hut this work has always been separate from and quite independent of the Ministry,,   In view of tho Important duties whioh are oarrie out by the other General Inspectors who aot In emergency as Chief Assistants to Civil Commissioners and maintain in ordinary times tho local organisation for the recruiting of labour, it is practically eosential that the Chief of Staff to the Chief Civil Commissioner should be one of the General Inspectors, who is acquainted with their genera wort, powers and. opportunitiesIt is, in my opinion, absolutely necessary that he should be a member of the Standinf Sub-Committee, both in the preparation and execution of emergency schemes, as the official who represex the Ministry of Health itself on that Committee has no responsibility for the out-door staff of the Ministry, i0e0 the General Inspectors, or their work in connection with the Civil Commissioners1 Department0(Tab)   I. S. A.26th March 1923.
