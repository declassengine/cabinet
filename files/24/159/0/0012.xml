S_S.C_R.J_T cp 118(23)HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.CBIMINAIi^ JUSTIC^^BIIL. ; (Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor)I circulate herewith a-draft cf the Criminal Justice Bill which has already received the general approval of the Cabinet, and which it is proposed shortly to introduce in the House of Lords.The Bill is mainly founded upon the recommendations of 3 Committees Appointed by the late Lord Chancellor,, namely:-(l)   A Committee on the detention in custody ofprisoners committed for trial, presided ;   over by Mi&apos;. Justice Horridge;(2)   a Committee on alterations in criminal procedure (indictable Offences).;, of which the Director of Public Prosecutions was the Chairman:   and(3)   A Committee on the responsibility of a wife - for crimes committed under the coercion of her husband, over which Mr. Justice Avory presided.Some of the proposals for the amendment of procedure in criminal cases are of a somewhat technical nature, and it appears unnecessary to deal with ther, at length; but the following clauses may be specially referred tot-Clause 1-enabling certain offences which are now triable only at Assices to be tried : at Quarter   Sessions.(THIS DOCUMENT ISf THE PROPERTY 01 HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY18 GOVERNMENT.
; Clause 2 enabling certain offences, offenders for which must now be sent for trial to Assizes or   Quarter Sessions, &quot;to be dealt with summarily by Magistrates. Clause 8 enabling Justices before whom a person is charged, instead of committing him for trial at the Assizes or Quarter Sessions for the County or Borough, to commit him to be tried at any other Assizes or Quarter Sessions with a view either to expediting his trial or saving expense-Clause 11 prescribing a procedure to be followed in the case of a corporation charged with an offence..Clause 13 giving a right of appeal against a sentence imposed by Magistrates on a person pleading &quot;Guilty&quot;. Clause 19 authorising the issue of a SearchWarrant where it is suspected that indecent or obscene articles are kept in any place. It is considered, that the above provisions and others contained in the Bill will have the effect of saving expense and delay in trial, or will otherwise assist in bringing offenders to justice.It is further proposed by Clause   3 of the Bill to abolish Grand Juries at Quarter Sessions.   During the vifar Grand Juries were suspended both at Assizes and Quarter Sessions, and no harm resulted-   At the end of the War the suspension came to an end, and some objection was taken by Judges and others to the abolition of Grand Juries at Assiaes,    In view of these objections I do not propose to deal with Grand Juries at Assizes;    but I am convinced
that so far as Quarter Sessions are concerned, - the suaimon-ing of a Grand Jury causes unnecessary expense to the county and loss of time&apos; to the jurors summoned, end that the time has come for its abolition.It, is proposed (by Clause 24) to abolish the rule by which a wife who commits an offence in the presence of her husband is presumed -to have committed it under coercion by him.    1&apos;he recent Peel case called public attention to this rule; but there have been other cases in which the rule is believed to have led to the acquittal of persons who were not really under any hind of coercion.    Ho such rule obtains in the Somiobck   The abolition of the presumption was recommended by the Criminal Code Commission&apos; ers in 1878, and by Sir James litzjames Stephens in his Digest cf the Criminal law, and has again been recommended by Mr- Justice Avory&apos;s Committee. I think it should now be abolished,,(Initialled)     C.80th February. 1925.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.irY.1. &apos; 20th February, 1923.
