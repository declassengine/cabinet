Wont hington-E v anr,4?&quot;    Committee on Post-War Pensions.This Committee was set up by Minute of the War Cabinet, dated 23rd April last, (Minute No. 4 of 559,), to consider&apos;s the question of post-war Naval and Military and Air Force Pensions, and to.&quot;examine and report upon the schemes proposed by the different Departments&quot;.     I was directed to act as Chairman.On April 28th letters were sent officially to the War Office, Admiralty and Air Ministry asking them to forward their proposals at the earliest possible moment.I received from the Admiralty, on the 11th instant, an official statement of their views, a copy of which is annexed to this Memorandum.   It will be observed that it contains no detailed proposals.   Nothing was forthcoming from the War Office or Air Ministry but as so much delay had already occurred I summoned a meeting of the Committee forthwith.The Meeting was held on the 16th instant, when the following members attended as representatives of their Departments:-Mr. T.D.James      -      AdmiraltyMr, J.G.Ashley ))Major G.A.D.Harvey, C.M.G.,)      War Office R.A.M.C. )Mr. W. Sanger, d,B. - Ministry of Pensions.Mr. G.M.Evans also attended as liaison officer between the Committee and the War Cabinet,I read to the Committee the terms of reference and pointed out to them that I had had no substantive proposals, the Admiralty Memorandum being a general statement of a negative kind which could not form the basis of discussion.   I then asked the representatives of the three Service Departments (War Office, Admiralty and AirMinistry)
Ministry) in turn whether they would produce proposala for the consideration of the Committee, as directed, by the War Cabinet,The Admiralty representative said that he was instructed by his Department on no account to allow Service pensions to be considered by the Committee,   He had, moreover, no instructions to put forward a scheme with regard to post- war disability pensions.The War Office representatives said that the 7/ar Office were not yet prepared with views or proposals,The Air Ministry representative said he had no scheme for disability pensions as he understood that they were a matter for the Ministry of Pensions,   His department was not prepared to agree with the Admiralty view that Service pensions were outside the scope of the Committee,    (He handed in a paper setting out the proposed rates of Service pensions, for Officers),,1 am forced, to bring this matter again to the Cabinet as the matter is -urgent. The present rates of pensions are for this War only and unless new rates are fixed at once the pre-war rates will again come into operation. Ho progress has been made during the last 2 months.I as^x the War Cabinet to give the following general directions in order to facilitate the preparation of schemes by the Admiralty, TJar Office and Air Ministry.ln     That the schemes should be lodged with me within a limited.period, say 14 days, 2.    That the retired pay and service pensions for officers and men he- settled by the Departments concerned and reported to me within the same period. 5.   That the scheme   of pensions etc,, should provide that ell officers and men discharged from service for   -rounds or disability should thereafter receive their pensions and gratuities solely from the Ministry of Pensions, notwith-standing that there is a service element in the award, 4*    That any wound pension or gratuity to be given to an officer or man intended to be retained in the Service should be jvouLjL by the Department in whose force he is serving.19th June 1919. L.W.E.
COMMITTEE Orl/pQ&amp;T jAR PENSIONS STATEMENT OF ADMIRALTY VIEWS ON WAR PENSIONSIt is understood that the functions of the Committee are restricted to (l) Disablement Pensions, awarded in respect of disablement attributable to, or aggravated by service and (2) Disability Pensions, awarded in respect of infirmities not attributable to, or in any way connected with service and now dealt with by the Ministry of Pensions and that they do not touch Service Pensions.So far as the former are concerned, ns objection is raised by the Admiralty to the principles governing the award of such pensions in the case of men, with the possible exception that experience has shown the necessity for a clear distinction being drawn between the award in respect of service and the award in respect of disablement.As regards Disability Pensions, the Admiralty view is that these pensions are in the nature of eleemosynary grants the State having no direct duty to men who have incurred a disability not caused in and by the Service.     The only title to consideration in such cases arises from the length and nature of service rendered.   The Jerram Conroittee, proceeding, it is believed, from tho assumption that all pensions are in the nature of deferred pay, have made a recommendation that all men compelled to leave the Service for infirmity should be awarded proportionate pensions&apos;on the Long Service Scale, earned by the actual years of service rendered.   The Board of Admiralty, while disposed to concur in the principle of this recommendation, have deferred the matter for further consideration.     For themoment
moment they are inclined to think that it is necessaryto couple with any such recommendation a condition requiringa minimum period of service in order to qualify for a lifepension.   The present minimum period necessary to qualify fora life pension for disability is 10 years.   This period doubtlessdates from the time when the period of Continuous Service Engagementin the Navy was 10 years.   The present period of Continuous ServiceEngagement, is however, 12 years, after which a man may engage tocomplete time for pension.   The termination of the first ContinuousService period is the logical and convenient line of demar cation forthe purpose of giving effect to tire recommendation of the JerramCommittee.   It is the favour of this suggestion that under the 10years period there was some ground for suspicion that men who did not wish to re-engage made efforts to get invalided out on account of sometrivial disability.A further point for consideration is whether any addition should be made to such pensions in respect of the nature and degree of infirmity.   Theoretically, as stated above, there is no obligation on the part of the State to take these factors into consideration but if any such additions are decided upon on humanitarian grounds, the Admiralty are again of opinion that a clear distinction should be drawn between the Service element and the Disability element.   Acting on the thoory above stated, that Disability Pensions are eleemosynary grants, payable only while the disability continues and in no respect compensation for loss of earning capacity caused in and by the Service the Admiralty have invariably insisted on the suspension of Disability Pensions when the man re-enters the Service and is found fit to. resume the duties of his rating.   During the War, however, the Ministry of Pensions obtained power, as from June 1917, to pay both Disablement and Disability Pensions to men who re-enter the Service.   The Admiralty are not aware of the arguments and reasons which lofl to this authority being granted, but as far as these pensions contain an element in respect of length of servicerendered
rendered, they think that the practice is unsound -nd cannot be defended.   The continuance of the pension awarded in respect of the element of disablement is, to sane extent, intelligible as being in accord with the principle of Mounds Pensions granted to Officers and with a further recommendation of the Jerram Committee, that such Pensions should also be granted to men which has now been accepted in principle by the War Cabinet. The continuance of a Service Pension or a Service element contained in the Disablement Pension while a man continues to draw full pay, cannot, however, be defended if the further Service rendered is to count for increase of Pension, and, indeed, in the case of the Disability Pensioner, has the effect that a man who is presumed to be to some extent incapacitated is actually remunerated at a higher rate than an able bodied man who has no infirmity.The Admiralty views in brief, therefore, may bo summarised as follows(1) The element for Service and the element for Disable-ment or Disability (if any) should, in all Pensions, be kept quite dist inct.(2)   In the case of men re-entering for further service only the element for Disablement or Disability should be continued.(3)    No man should draw pay and Service Pension-concurrently and count the time so served for increase of pension.Under the foregoing a Disability pensioner desiring to re-enter to complete time -should be required&apos; to refund any portion of the Service element of the Disability pension drawn by him during his further sei^vice but pension drawn (or gratuity) while out of the service should not be refunded.A disablement pensioner in similar case should refund only the Service element of his pension, the balance being regarded as a sifounds Pension,As regards Officers, the principles underlying the award of
of compensation for physical disablement are different from those obtaining in the case of persons engaged in manual labour and no observations can be offered at the present stage pending consideration of certain proposals in regard to their Retired Pay generally and to their widow.s pensions and Children1s Allowances which have been put forward by a Committee presided over by Rear Admiral Sir Lionel Halsey.
