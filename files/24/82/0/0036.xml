This Document is the Property of ministry of SHIfflfflWtannlc Majesty&apos;s Government,TRANSPORT   OF   TROOPS   TO INDIAtlfith&quot;reference to the War Office Memorandum (G.T.7510) lng the transport of troops to India, it is an absolute impossibility to meet all the War Office demands.   For instance, they wish to insist on such a severe restriction cf the number of troops embarked on the ships that it is physically Impossible to meet another of the$0/insistent demands, namely,   that the battalions shall travel as complete units.The ordinary regulations for the conveyance of troops by sea provide that as many troops as can sit at the mess tables shall be embarked.   The   Shipping Controller had already agreed on several occasions to reduce the number embarked sufficiently to enable each man to have a sleeping billet.   This entails a reduction of about 20%,In the case of the proposed move of battalions tt 0 India the.Shipping Controller has agreed that from Egypt onward the number of troops&apos; embarked shall be still further reduced by 50$, making a total reduction of about 60$ as compared with the regulations.The Army Council are asking for a still further reduction in the numbers of troops accouaodated in the lower decks.Even with the restrictions agreed to by the Shipping Controller it Is going to be very difficult indeed to provide shipping to convey the battalions at the rate demanded, namely, 2 battalions a week,The War Office opposed landing the   men in Egypt for transhipment and to this the Shipping Controller has agreed but has asked that where direct transhipment can take place the numbers embarked as far as Egypt shall be double the number proceeding in the ships thereafter, thus enabling the ships brought from India to embark their troops tealead of utilising ether shipping on the whole route from this country to India.If the/
If the War (Tfice demand for an uninterrupted sea journey is approved, the amount f)f shipping required will he very largely increased, certainly by more than 50$, and the demand can only be metJL&amp;ing for the purpose ships now in the course of preparation for the repatriation of Dominion troops.81.6.19.
