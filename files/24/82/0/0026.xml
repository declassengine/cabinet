West Indian Court of Appeal Bill.MEMORANDUM.The proposal to establish a West Indian Court of Appeal with a wider scope than the existing Windward Islands Appeal Court has been under consideration for some years, and assumed definite shape as the result of an Inter-Colonial Conference held in Trinidad early in 1916.This Bill, which has been submitted to and concurred in by the various administrations concerned, provides for the con-stitution of a Court of Appeal for the colonies of Trinidad and Tobago, British Guiana, Barbados, the Leeward Islands, Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent. Power is taken by Order in Council to bring other colonies within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal if provision for the purpose is made by the legislature of the colony. As the proposed legislation affects several colonies simultaneously and in combination, it is necessary to proceed by Imperial Statute.The Court of Appeal set up under the Bill will take the place of the existing Windward Islands Court of Appeal constituted under the Act of 1889.The court will consist of the chief justices of the colonies to whom the Act applies, or in the case of the inability of a chief justice to sit, some duly qualified substitute; but power is taken to appoint an additional judge from outside, who is to be a barrister of not less than eight years&apos; standing. The president of the court will be the Chief Justice of Trinidad.The expenses of the Court of Appeal will, except so far as met by fees, be defrayed out of the colonial revenues.The Act will not affect the right of appeal to the Judicial Committee. of the Privy Council, except so far as provision may be made by local legislation for appeals being taken in the first instance to the new Court of Appeal14-2

SECRET *hep.ortof Sub-Committee on Technical Questions appointed by the Cabinet Committee on Liquor Restrictions.SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS. Scope and object of the Report.1.   Our terms cf reference were &quot;to consider the technical questions arising upon the present controls of the quantity, gravity, and., price of beer, with special reference to the control of gravity by the method of limitation to a maximum of the average gravity of each brewers output&quot;     Our enquiry v*es thus concerned solely with the technical aspect of questions, ma jor questions of policy being excluded, and the Committee do not commit themselves, in this Report, to any views as to general national policy.     Tho Report is presented as an estimate of the effects, which mif-jht follow the adoption of alternative courses, rather than in the form of concrete recommendations.2.   Vie have examined all the alternatives on the assumption that private interest in the sale of drink is to continue, and all our conclusions are subject to this reservation.Control of Gravity. 3..   The original reason for control, namely to eke out the quantity of brewing materials when standard barrelage had to be severely curtailed, has now largely ceased to operate.   The present form of gravity control is not ideal, but or the assumption that existina private interests in the t^ade are to continue, no better method of gravity-control than the present one can be devised.     The abolition of the existing
. *-*control over average gravity would cause a general increase in gravities though we are unable to estimate the extent of such increase.   The abolition of oot,h gravitv and quant it v control night, in the opinion of the w* priority of the Committee, seriously endanger national sobriety.Control of Quantity. 4.     The advantages of controlling quantity are (a) that it helps to prevent soaking, and. (b) that it removes the incentive to excessive inter-trade competition find the undesirable results which fellow.Its objections are that (a) a provides a useful handle for agitators, and (b) it has a tendency towards rush-drinkingj i,e., consumption per individual of greater quantities than the same individual would, drink if supply was adequate and regular.The present quantity of 26,000,000 standard barrels is probably as much as the Trade can handle for some time, and. accordingly it is doubtful whether the frovernirient have. anything to f;ain in the way of temperance by restricting quantity at all^Control of Price. 5.     Until absolutely free competition comes into operation., retention of control of price is essential.   The control of price in its relation to taxation, should be such as to secure approxi-mateiy a parity of profit between light, medium and heavy beer.
B,   -OEKBRAL EXAMINATION OF  QTOQLS. The principle of a maximum average gravity.,li   Government control of gravities were originally imposed not as a measure of sobriety, but to secure the largest practi-cabie bulk&apos;&quot;supply of beer without injuring the goodwill of specialist ^reweTg ^hen the food situation necessitated eeVere curtailment of barrelage in the spring of 1917.   Every in-crease of standard barrelage tends- to diminish the need,.of* c.on* trolling gravity merely to secure.jno&apos;o*e-bulk.2. - The detailed measures by which a conrparativeiyXow&apos; gravity is to be secured should achieve:-(a) maximum effect in promoting efficiency and sobriety(b) maximum public contentment(c) minimum inconvenience, and maximum equity of treatment as between different sections of the trade.3.    (a) and (b) can be secured when the bulk of the beer supply is brewed at medium gravities.   It would be no great service to sobriety, to put a hypothetical case, to achieve an arithmetical average of 1040 by arrangements which resulted in half the beer supply being brewed at 1070, and half at 1010. the evidence available indicates that such results lead to public resentment and misunderstanding.-4. &apos; Under the existing regulation, the average gravity of the national beer supply is limited to 10400 J .or 10470inIreland) by the bare requirement that the average gravity ofthe total product of any brewer shall not exceed these figures.Subject to compliance with this requirement each brewer is freebrewto choose in what proportions he will/light, medium, and heavy beer.&apos;5V&apos; It is evident that such a regulation in itself does nothing to prevent brewing on a large scale toward the extremes
of gravity, to the neglect of medium gravities, although a substantial proportion has (for other reasons) been brewed at medium gravities.   In the annexed table are shown the quantities and gravities of the beer bra-wed *n the.United Kingdom in&apos;the month of April 1919 by 105 representative brewers in England, 9 in Scotland and 8 in Ireland whose output represented 49 per cent of the total quantity brewed in that month.   The percentages of bulk barrels on which duty is levied at the various gravities for each of the three countries are as follows:-Under 10230	10230 ori over but less thai 10290	10290 or over but l less tin 10350	10350or over bu m less -10420	10420 or t over but   &apos; :han less tin ^OSO0	:     1C500 m or overPresent pub- 3d.     4d. lie bar price per pint.		5d.          6d.        7d.			8d.%          %         %             %          % England      13.52   2*7,4     24,8           16.1     13.2 Scotland      7.2X   10.0    22.3           34.3      5.7 * Ireland         -        -         6.5           50.1      6.8					% 5.0 20.5 36.6The average was:-England Scotland Ireland10310 10380 104805&apos;or details of the above table, see Appendix.6.   The scale of controlled beer-prices which has beeniin force since February 1919, has Sene much to remove the in-centive which previously existed to brew at either end of the scale of gravities in order to make larger profits, to the neglect of the mean, and has gone some distance to place beers of different gravities on a parity so far as regards the immediateIn addition, a small quantity of very low-gravity beer has been brewed for blendirn. with stronger beers.
ta      )     **profit which they yield.    The continued tendency to brew a certain proportion at extreme gravities must be due partly to the brewers whose market is for special beers of high gravity, who, to produce this are compelled by the existing regulation to produce beer of a low gravity in order to reduce their average and partly to public demand.     Specialist brewers are not concerned to find a permanent market for their low gravity beers as such, but only to ensure that it shall operate to the fullest possible extent in reducing their average. The incentive is thus to brew their average-reducing beer at a gravity which is so extremely low as to be generally unaccept-able to the public.     (r!&apos;e understand that most of this very light beer is blended up to produce, a medium gravity beer before being put on the market).7.     The present system by which gravity is controlled failed to secr^c a medium gravity until the present price order was introduced.3,     The only form of gravity control by which this objective could be guaranteed would be by direct control of the output of all breweries.     It is, however, certain from past experience that such a regulation would encounter grave political difficulties as the interests of special brewers would be affected.     The committee have considered and rejected various suggestions for alternative forms of gravity control.     It appears that the only choice is between retaining the existing form of gravity-control, with its imperfections and abandoning control of gravity altogether.&apos;Removal of existing controls.(a)   Removal of control of gravity.9.     The reasons for and against removal of control of gravity vary and depend   upon the permitted quantity.    ^hen
the quantity of hear is much below the demand, the public objection to gravity-control, that it forces the acceptance of large quantities of very weak bear in default of any other kind, in,strong.    When the permitted quantity is large,the percentage of very weak bear to the total supply is less, even though the aggregate quantity may be increased.    There is thus less public agitation when gravity-control is accompanied by a large output.    Further, with the present shortage of transport facilities and of casks, the larger the permitted quantity the greater incentive would there be without a control of gravity to brew a smaller number of bulk barrels at a higher gravity for sale at a higher price, in order to economise casks and transport.    Thus the effect of now releasing gravity from control would probably be to raise the gravity all round.10.   If therefore, it is regarded as an essential ob-ject of public policy to prevent a sudden or substantial reversion to the proved unnecessary high gravities of a few years ago, the choice must lie between (a) increasing quantity and controlling gravity, and (b) restricting quantity and removing control over gravity.     Some members of the Committee take the view that, even with unrestricted supply, the maximum consequential increase in gravity that could be reasonably expected would not be serious enough to justify the retention of the present control of gravity with its attendant disadvantages.     Others, however, do not feel they could agree to releasing control both of q:\ar-tity and of gravity.     It is almost impossible to prophesy to what extent gravity would be increased if the present control wore removed.The. Baltic, supply of timber suitable for cases has been cut off during the last three years.
(b) Removal of Control of Quantity.



11. If the choice lies between unlimited controlled gravity, and restricted quantity with free gravity, the majority of the Committee favour the former alternative.

12. If the supply is kept substantially below the demand industrial unrest is certain, and can be easily kept alive. To put it at its lowest, agitators are provided with a convenient means of discrediting the administration. Further, the incentive to rush-drinking is maintained, so that a loss to sobriety is involved to set off against the gain. If on the other hand, supply is kept just short of demand, while these objections are diminished, but not removed, the tendency of excessive competition to introduce undesirable practices is kept in check. So long as standard barrelage remains restricted, even if the quantity is in theory nearly equal to demand, there is always probability of agitation. Agitators, so long as quantity is controlled will always accuse the Government of keeping the number of standard barrels below the pre-war number, omitting any comparison of bulk barrelage.



13. It cannot be doubted that continued restriction of quantity substantially below demand would provoke more outcry, and be a mere difficult policy to maintain than continued central of gravity. By relaxing quantity - control and retaining gravity-control, the Government would relinquish the mere unpopular and retain the more reliable check.



(c) Removal of Control of Prices.



14. The need for controlling prices depends largely on the supplies available. With unlimited supplies available but with control of average gravity, prices for all but the heaviest bears will tend to regulate themselves. With short supplies or restricted output, experience shows that control of all prices is essential.
