A number of causes of a commercial as well as of an in-dustrial nature are at the present time operating to diminish production. The former is not within the province of this Report, but it is clear that the uncertain conditions of the present time are the most disadvantageous possible for the functioning of private enter-prise, especially in regard to the provision of credit. But there are also serious forces acting adversely on production from the industrial and labour side of the matter. The reaction after the prolonged strain of the war is undoubtedly having a considerable effect, which&apos; may be more noticeable through the summer months than it has been hitherto. This is illustrated in a peculiar, if not very important, way by the exaggerated interest which is being taken in some quarters in the question of holidays. The same force is probably partly responsible for the pressure which is being exerted by organised labour at present against the system of payment by results ; though, of course, this has always been unpopular in many tradee, and it was to be expected in any event that an endeavour would be made to give the reaction against the extension of it which took place during the war, such a momentum as to result in a considerable net diminution as compared even with pre-war days.  Such an attempt is especially evident at present in the wood-working(0 1813)   160 6/10 HAS A
trades. There would appear to be little doubt, too, that in certain cases at any rate, in-creased wages, in spite of the high cost of living, have reduced the incentive to work, and thus tended to diminution in output. This naturally is to be looked for mostly in the highly-paid occupations.But probably hitherto at any rate the most important factor on the labour side making for diminished output has been the reduction in working hours.   The extent to which this has taken place, mostly without corresponding reduction in remuneration, may hot generally be recognised, but an examination of the statistics available with regard to it make the claim put forward in certain quarters that it has had or will have little or no effect on out-put nothing short of ridiculous.   It is true that certain groups of workpeople stand out prominently in this movement for shorter hours, noticeably railwaymen, engineers, ship-yard workers, and coal miners ; but it by no means confined to them..   It is now roughly true to say that in nearly all the most important industries of the country, and in a very large number of lesser trades, arrangements have either already been made for a reduction of the normal weekly hours of labour, or negotiations to this end are on foot.  In the build-ing trades decreases ranging usually from 3 to 8 hours a week have already come into operation in the case of over 100,000 operatives, or nearly one quarter the total number. The recommendations contained in the Sankey Report will result, after the 16th July, in a reduction of the daily hours of nearly 750,000 men, i.e., all the underground workers in the coal mining industry, from 8 to 7 ; and the weekly hours of about 200,000 surface workers corresponding from 49 to 46^.*  Nearly all the trades comprising the metal, engineering and shipbuilding group have been affected, which means that well over one and a half million workpeople have had their working time reduced mostly by 6 or 7 hours, to a level of 47 or 48 per week.   In some sections, indeed, the reduction has been con-siderably more, e.g., the iron and steel trade workers, who have had their shifts reduced from the 1,2 to the 8 hour standard.  In this connection mention should be made of the further demand which is now being put forward in the engineering and ship-building trades for a further reduction of three hours to a 44-hour week.f  Among the textile workers, reductions of 6 or 7 hours to a level generally of 48 hours have been obtained in the principal centres of the woollen and worsted, bleaching and dyeing, hosiery, carpet, etc., trades, the number of operatives affected being over 400,000 ; while in the cotton trade negotiations are in progress, J the result of which will affect at least half a million workpeople, or practi-cally the whole trade.   Of the clothing trades affected by the hours movement the most important is the boot and shoe trade, in which agreements reducing the working week from 52^ to 48 hours have been arrived at.  In all, probably over 160,000 clothing trade workers have had their hours reduced.   In the transport trades reductions have in general been more substantial than in other trades.  Carters and motormen have received reduc-tions ranging from 1\ to 20 hours, railwaymen from 6 to 10 hours, tramwaymen from 1\ to nearly 14, and dock labourers from 6 to 10.  The number of transport workers thus covered is probably close on 900,000.    In the woodworking trades reductions ranging usually from 3 to 7 hours have been obtained by over 100,000 workpeople; in the paper printing, book binding, etc., trades reductions of 1 to 5 hours by over 150,000 workpeople. In the food trades especially in flour milling, one of the most important, where the decreases amount to from 9 to 12 hours probably about 100,000 workpeople are affected ; and in the chemical, pottery, brick, glass, etc., trades another 200,000.   In addition to these trades where general agreements are known to have been come to, there are others in which considerable reductions have been brought about in specific areas by local agreement. In all, it may be said that the number of workpeople affected by reductions in working hours either in operation or agreed upon amounts to some 5 millions out of an industrial population of some 12 to 16 millions, and while a general figure cannot of course be given representing the extent of the reduction, the above summary is sufficient to indicate that in many cases at least it is.by no means negligible.* It may be noted that already this year the hours of these surface workers have been once reduced, the reduction ranging from 2 to 9 hours, and bringing the weekly hours down to 49.f It may be remarked in passing, however, that there seems a fair chance of a bitter struggle before this comes into operation even if it does at all in the near future. The engineering employers probably went as far as they are prepared to go in agreeing to a 47-hour week, and will make a firm stand against further encroach-ment so soon. Their stiffening attitude may already be seen in their replying to a demand for an advance in wages of 15s. a week by suggesting a reduction of 5s. It seems possible indeed that the first real pitched battle since the war may be the result. The employers are well organised, and will probably rely on their own strength, while the workpeople are already committed to corresponding action.\ Negotiations as a matter of fact have reached a deadlock. The reduction which the employers have offered would amount to 1\ hours per week, while the operatives are demanding 9. Presumably therefore, whatever is the outcome of the negotiations (which are complicated by a wages dispute) the reduction will be at least 1\ hours a week. Since, however, a great deal of organised short time has recently been worked in the cotton trade, this may not have a very marked effect immediately on production.
^ There are two points of great importance to notice about the movement for shorter hours summarised above. In the first place, with.negligible exception there has been no corresponding reduction in earnings, and in the majority of cases there has been a compensating increase in the rates received for the shorter working time. Secondly, except in the case of shift workers, who form a comparatively small minority, these reductions all mean reduction in normal period of output * That reduction of working hours must mean a reduction of output, at least temporarily, is obvious. It may be found that in the long run the additional energy due to shorter hours may largely com-compensate them, as appears to have been the case in the coal trade after the passing of the Eight Hours Act; but such compensation is impossible unless the workers make the fullest use of the time during which they work. Unfortunately, however, there are signs that this is by no means the case, but that in some trades a policy of restriction of output is being followed. In certain quarters, e.g., among the followers of the Plebs League in South Wales, this policy appears to be based on certain economic and political theories, but probably the larger part of its manifestations are built on the belief that the less work there is done, the more there is to do, and that therefore restriction of output is the remedy for unemployment. This is a dangerous doctrine, because it is in certain respects very attractive to individual work-men, and therefore is likely to spread, and because in many in fact in most circum-stances, it is not only untrue but the very reverse of the truth. Above a certain point, the employment of more workpeople is limited absolutely in spite of any conditions relating to output by working conditions and appliances, such as number of machines, factory space, &amp;c. If there are ten machines completely filling the space of the factory, the number of workpeople who can be employed is limited absolutely in the short period by this fact, and the only way to employ any more is to put in an extra shift. Further, if the operatives on these machines limit output either by working less hours, or by ca&apos; canny, or in any other way the result will be an immediate reduction in opportunity for employment in all trades that either minister to this one or that it ministers to. In view of these considerations, it appears possible that the prevalence of the perverse theory referred to above is as much a cloak for a passionate desire for an easier time after five years of strain as anything else.Part II. Demobilisation and Resettlement.Out-of-Work Donation.Civilian Workers. The period of six months for which the out-of-wrork donation scheme for civilian workers was originally instituted expired towards the end of May. The original scheme had provided a maximum of 13 weeks&apos; donation during this period of six months, but owing to the great amount of unemployment it was necessary to add a second period of donation not exceeding 13 weeks. During this second period of 13 weeks the weekly rate of donation was reduced from 29s. to 20s. in the case of men, and from 25s. to 15s. in the case of women. It was further provided that before an applicant who had exhausted the first 13 weeks could obtain additional donation his or her case should be passed under review by the Local Employment Committee (consisting in the main of representatives of.employers and employed in the locality), who had to be satisfied that the applicant was normally in employment, was genuinely seeking work and was unable to obtain it.This grant of a second 13 weeks&apos; donation involved a corresponding extension of the period during which the donation could be drawn. This period, which was originally six months, was extended to twelve months, thus expiring towards the end of November, 1919. This extension was coupled with a general reduction in the weekly rate of donation for civilian workers as from the end of the first period of six months, i.e., from the end of May. After this date the weekly rate of donation for civilian workers was fixed at 20s. for men and 15s. for women in all cases, i.e., including those in which the applicant had not exhausted the first 13 weeks&apos; donation by the end of May, and those in which the applicant did not begin to draw donation until after that date.Some time before the end of May the review of cases by the Local Employment Committees, which had originally applied only to applications for extension of donation where the first 13 weeks had been drawn, was extended so as to cover also certain classes* Except in so far as compensating overtime is worked, when the only result of reduced normal hours is an increase in wages.  There is no evidence, however, that this has hitherto occurred to any wide extent.(C 1813) A 2
of cases where the applicants were still on the first 13 weeks of donation. These classes were selected as being those in which there was likely to be the highest proportion of doubtful cases. * The Local Employment Committees were empowered to cancel the grant of donation in these cases if they were not satisfied that the applicants were normally in employment, were genuinely seeking work and were unable to obtain it.When the first period of six months expired at the end of May the scrutiny by the Local Employment Committees was further extended to all cases of claims to donation by civilian workers.  It now covers, therefore :-(a) Applications for extension of donation after the first 13 weeks have been drawn ; (6) The special classes above referred to of applicants who have not yet drawn thefirst 13 weeks but are selected for early scrutiny because they contain a largeproportion of doubtful cases ;(c) The remainder of the cases where the first 13 weeks have not been exhausted ;(d) New applications for donation.Certain minor classes of applications are for special reasons not included in the scrutiny, e.g., those of workpeople who are working short time under conditions which entitle them to donation.Owing to the large numbers involved it was obviously not possible to suspend donation in all cases at the end of May until the scrutiny by the Committees had been performed. It was therefore arranged to spread the work over a period of about eight weeks and deal with the cases within this period roughly in the order of the items set out in the preceding -ing paragraph. Pending consideration by the Committees a provisional grant of donation is made by the Exchange if the application appears to be prima facie a proper one.A further modification of the rales with regard to donation for civilian workers which is of importance is that brought into operation in May, under which applicants for donation are in general required to show that they were employed in each of at least 20 weeks during the year 1918.Largely owing to the review of cases by the Local Employment Committees the number of civilian workers on out-of-work donation has for a considerable time shown a steady decline, which, from about the beginning of May, has been greatly accentuated owing to the extension of the review. For instance, the number of women civilian workers on donation fell from 444,000 at the end of April to 210,000 at the end of May ; and the number of men civilian workers fell from 215,000 at the end of April to 150,000 at the end of May.EM. Forces. The original scheme of out-of-work donation for demobilised members of H.M. Forces provided a maximum of 26 weeks&apos; donation during a period of twelve months. Towards the end of May, 1919, a certain number of ex-service men, who had been on donation from the outset, exhausted the amount due to them, and as each week passed after that date the number of men in this position increased. Owing to the absence of any reasonable prospect of general re-employment for these men at an early date it was decided that, as had been done in the case of civilian workers, there should be an extension of donation for demobilised members of H.M. Forces who had exhausted the 26 weeks to which they were originally entitled and who were still out of employment. The further amount of donation which may thus be drawn is limited to 13 weeks (in addition to the original 26 weeks), and is to be at the weekly rate of 20s. for men and 15s. for women (i.e., those members of the women&apos;s service corps who are entitled to donation as such). Before the extended donation is granted the case must pass under a review by the Local Employment Committee similar to that to which applications by civilian workers are subjected.It is, as yet, too early to judge the effect of this step on public opinion. Some attempt is already being made to use it for political purposes. Thus in an article published in the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; of the 9th June, and reprinted &quot; in response to appeals from ex-service men and trade unionists &quot; on the 10th June, Mr. E. L. Outhwaite speaks of the reduction of the out-of-work donation as bringing &quot; the demobilised soldier to the plight of semi-starvation in the land he has been told he saved from foreign possession.&quot;  The ex-soldier* These classes are as follows : (1) Persons who have been submitted for employment at least six times without being placed, or who are for other reasons considered to be practically unplaceable ; (2) persons of either sex who were employed for less than 26 weeks during the year 1918 ; (3) married women ; (4) those who were not registered as unemployed and seeking work on the 23rd November, and who were unemployed for four weeks or more before they first registered after that date, and (5) persons of either sex over 70 years of age. To these have been recently added (6) those who are believed to have been engaged, immediately before the war or during it, in a business or occupation on their own account or in partnership, and were not immediately dependent on wages.
part III. Press Comments.(1) Labour and Socialist Press. (A) Foreign Affairs.Russia.Russia assumes, in the discussions upon Foreign Affairs in the papers reviewed this week, the most prominent place, but, whereas a fortnight ago it was mainly English and Allied policy towards Russia that was dealt with,* this week it is the internal condition of Russia which attracts attention. A record of an interview with a Russian who left Moscow on the 20th May, from the pen of Miss Sylvia Pankhurst, appears in &quot; Forward,&quot; in &quot;Call,&quot; in the Merthyr &quot;Pioneer,&quot; and in the &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; It describes the military position of the Soviet Government in some detail, and contains statements to the effect that &quot; all the Asiatic nations &quot; were represented at the first, conference of the Moscow International, and that it is believed by the Communists in Russia that a secret treaty exists between the German Government and the Allies by which the Germans are to do police duty for the Allies in Russia. The &quot; Yorkshire. Factory Times &quot; contains an article which treats mainly of the importance in Russia of the co-operative movement, and the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; prints a speech which was delivered in Russia in December, 1918, dealing with the financial policy of the Soviet Government. It appears from this that the Soviet People&apos;s Bank did not at first work smoothly until it was decided to nationalise the so-called &quot; Moscow People&apos;s Bank,&quot; which had the support of Russian Co-operative organisations. Mr. F. W. Jowett in his article in the &quot; Pioneers &quot; of Bradford and Merthyr, complains that the Government refuses to give information about the excellent educational system which he maintains the  Soviet Government has instituted.  Mr.  Philip  Snowden, in  the* Cf. Eeport, 4th June, page 4. (C 1813) A 3is urged to demand &quot; back pay &quot; at a rate which would equalise his pay during service with that, say, of members of the Australian Forces. Mr. OuthwahVs main object appears to be to draw attention to the schemes for the taxation of land virtues which he puts forward as the obvious means of satisfying the ex-soldier&apos;s claims. The Discharged Sailors&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Federation have asked for work rather than the out-of-work donation ; but, failing employment, they suggested that the donation should stand at 29s. a week, increased to  2 a week where there are children.Committee of Inquiry. The Committee recently appointed by the Minister of Labour to inquire into the out-of-work donation scheme has made an Interim Report which will shortly be published as a Parliamentary Paper. The Report makes several recommenda-tions for modification of the scheme on points of detail, and points out that the modifications already made in the rules since March have fundamentally limited the scope of the scheme as originally introduced in November. The Committee say that the scrutiny by the Local Employment Committee is an essential safeguard against abuse of the scheme and add that the rules laid down for the guidance of the Committees in dealing with applications appear to be generally well-conceived and that the Committees appear to have carried them out in an efficient manner.As regards the alleged abuse of the scheme, the conclusion of the Committee is that the evidence so far heard by them affords no ground for supposing that there has been extensive fraudulent abuse of the donation scheme. The Committee say that the scheme as introduced in November last was so wide in its scope that many persons who were not really &quot; seeking work &quot; could, and did, take advantage of it; that owing to the dis-location of industry it was not usually possible to test their good faith by offering them employment; and that in their opinion it is the existence of this class&apos; of case which has given rise&apos; to the impression that the scheme has been widely abused. The Committee point out, however, that it is important to recognise that these persons, however inde-fensible their action in claiming donation might be on moral grounds, were committing no fraud ; they came within the purview of the scheme, and the Employment Exchanges had no option but to pay them the donation. The Committee further point out that the scheme has already been modified with a view to excluding such cases, and conclude, from the evidence which they have heard, that it may be assumed that this object has now been largely achieved.
&quot; Labour Leader,&quot; adopts the opinion which the &quot; New Statesman&quot; expressed last week,* that the policy of intervention in Eussia is breaking down before the logic of facts, while &quot; Call&quot; comments, in a similar spirit, upon the modified position which it alleges Mr. Churchill took up in the House of Commons on the 6th June. The &quot; Clarion &quot; reviews Mr. E. H. Keeling&apos;s book on &quot; Bolshevism,&quot; and maintains that the shortage of food in Eussian cities is the result of an internal boycott, not of the external blockade-Mr. Archibald Lee, in &quot; Justice,&quot; discusses Bolshevik rule, and compares it to the rule of the Thirty Tyrants in Athens and of Nero in Rome. Mr. F. W. Jowett, in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; comments adversely upon the proposed presentation to the Ex-Empress of Eussian officers in England ; he doubts the sincerity of Koltchak&apos;s professions with regard to a Constituent Assembly. Mr. Joseph King, in the same paper, maintains that the &quot; Big Four &quot; are employing against Eussia the very men, arms and methods which they went into the war to defeat. (It may be noted that Sir Leo Chiozza Money, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; also alleges that Allied and German military methods are identical, and compares the present military occupation of the left bank of the Ehine with the German occupation of Belgium.)Italian and Swiss Socialist Parties.Mr. ramsay Macdonald in &quot; Forward,&quot; and Mr. Charles Eoden Buxton in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; both describe their recent excursion to Italy and Switzerland to persuade the Italian and Swiss Socialist Parties to join the Second (Berne) International. Mr. ramsay Macdonald outlines the Italian Socialist position towards intervention in Eussia, which would seem to be identical with his own. Mr. Buxton draws a distinction between the attitude of the Italian and the Swiss parties with regard to the Internationals. The Swiss party has not, he says, decided to join the Third International, while the Italian party has done so; but both parties are equally suspicious of the Berne Inter-national. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; adjures the Italian Socialists not to be deceived by Mr. Macdonald&apos;s fair words, and maintains that he has concealed from them his real hostility to the Soviet ideal of government. &quot; Justice &quot; copies from the French (&quot; La France Libre &quot;) an attack by M. Jean Loquin upon the Italian Socialist Party. It has, says M. Loquin, by its isolated attitude during the war and by allowing the impression to spread that it favoured Germany, lost all prestige in Italy ; and by obeying Lenin&apos;s mandate of hostility to President Wilson, in the Fiume episode it played into the hands of the annexationists.Peace Conference.The &quot; New Statesman,&quot; in view of the near approach of the end of the labours of the Peace Conference, comments upon the &quot; inglorious end of the greatest international conference that was ever held.&quot; It has no doubt that the Treaty with Germany will have been improved by the alterations introduced in answer to the German counter-proposals, and thinks that, the outlook is brighter. The sooner Germany signs, the sooner, it says, will the international atmosphere be cleared for the necessary process of further revision. Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; urges the Labour Party to take the lead in agitating for a revision of the Treaty, and not to be behind the workers&apos; organisations of the Continent in making an effective protest.Manifestos.&quot; Call &quot; and the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; reprint from &apos;-&apos; La Vie Ouvriere &quot; an appeal from the Committee of Foreign Affairs of the Hungarian Socialist Party to the workers of Allied Countries. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; prints the Moscow manifesto on the Peace which the &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; reprinted from &quot; L&apos;Humanite &quot; a fortnight ago.f Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; is of the opinion that the new joint peace manifesto of the Parliamentary Labour Party and the Labour Party Executive is an improvement upon the original statement of the Executive. The comment of &quot; Call&quot; upon this joint manifesto is, &quot; Fine words butter no parsnips.&quot;(B) Home Affairs.Parliamentary Labour Party.Mr. Philip Snowden in the &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; and the &quot;Democrat,&quot; review the Parliamentary situation on the eve of the Whitsuntide recess. They both remark that the so-called &quot; Free Liberals &quot; have beaten the Labour Party at every point in the contest* Of. Report, 11th June, page 4.f Report, 4th June, page 5.
for Parliamentary importance. Mr. Snowden confesses that too much, perhaps, had been expected from the Labour members, but, after making every allowance for exaggerated expectations, he says the Labour members have not done as well as they ought to have done. He criticises, in particular, the &quot; weak leadership &quot; of Mr. Adamson, and the lax attendance of his followers.Coal Mines Commission.Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; refers to the reduced output figures which were put before the Commission on the 4th June. He urges the miners to realise the need that there should be no just cause of complaint that laxity on their part is responsible in any degree for the diminished output. The &quot; Clarion &quot; supports the policy of Nationalisation, but insists that the retention in the service of the State of the present mine managers and active owners is essential to the success of the policy. Mr. Joe Terrett, in &quot; Justice,&quot; maintains that the crux of the coal problem is how to give effect to the interests of the consumers in any seheme of management; he advocates, under Nationalisation, the establishment of a &quot; Consumers&apos; &quot; Board to work pari passu with a &quot; Producers&apos; &quot; Board. He contends that it is in such Consumers&apos; organisations generally that we shall find the best line of resistance to the evils common to bureaucracy and syndicalism.Co-operative Movement.With reference to the Co-operative Congress held at Carlisle at Whitsuntide, the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; rejoices that the Co-operative movement is coming to realise the need for political action, and is throwing off its old antipathy to communal ownership and control. The Merthyr &quot; Pioneer &quot; is very critical of Co-operation ; in particular, it criticises the working of the so-called &quot; dividend &quot; system, and does not think that any good can come of a &quot;College&quot; (such as the Congress recommended to be established) set up by a body which has, in its opinion, a narrow-minded and antiquated outlook on economics.The Triple Alliance and Politics.The &quot; British Citizen&quot; attacks the Triple Alliance in general, and Mr. Veinon Harts-horn in particular, for the claim which it attributes to them, that the Triple Alliance may rely on its industrial importance to force Parliarhent and the community to suit their actions and policies to its fancy. Such action, maintains the &quot; British Citizen,&quot; is an abuse of the privileges granted to Trade Unionism by Parliament. The &quot; Nation&quot; reviews the Transport Workers&apos; conference at Swansea : it says that there is no room for doubt that considerable numbers of the rank and file of the workers are disquieted at the prospect of being drawn suddenly into a strike for what they consider to be primarily questions for Parliament.Trade Unionism.Mr. John Bryan in &quot; Call&quot; concludes his article on &quot; Parliamentarism and Trade Unionism.&quot; Last week* he maintained that Parliament was not a source of political or social progress; this week he maintains that Trade Unions, too cannot be expected to* play a leading part in the &quot; revolution.&quot; He dwells on the facts that Trade Unions derive their strength from a practical assumption of the durability of present society, that they are sectional and exclusive in their organisation, that their constitutions are such as to impede quick and decisive revolutionary action, and that their officials are conservative; in opinion, chosen for bureaucratic excellence (not for political temperament) and detached from the rank and file of their members. He contrasts the success of the Revolution in Russia, where there were few Trade Unions, with its abortive character in Germany, where there were many ; and he refers to the recent &quot; ghastly failure of the Triple Alliance and the T.U.C.&quot; in the affair of the so-called Southport resolutions. He therefore summons all members of the B.S.P. to foster unofficial Workers&apos; Committees and similar &quot; rank and file &quot; movements. The &quot; Democrat &quot; attacks the action of the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Associa-tion in expelling Mr. Jim Walton, M.P. from their membership, and suggests that the incident should not yet be considered as closed.f* Report, 11th June, page 6. f Cf. Report, 4th June, page 6.(C1813) A 4
Industrial Unrest.The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; thinks that the prevalent world-wide industrial unrest has deeper causes than the high cost of food and mere political agitation. It is, this paper maintains, the uprising of the Proletariat to save the world from the catastrophe of the Peace, and is prompted by a desire to make the world safe for, democracy. The &quot; New Statesman &quot;concludes that all over Europe and, to some extent, in America, the armies are mobilising lor something like a class war, and that in this country, too, similar forces are at work. It regards the fundamental causes of this unrest as econmic, though it thinks some political blunder may well cause a conflagration.Political Conferences.The &quot; Clarion &quot; thinks that Mr. Seddon&apos;s presidential address to the National Demo-cratic Party was grateful and comforting, and that the whole tone of the N.D.P. conference was nearer the spirit of the &quot; Clarion &quot; than that of any democratic assembly Mr. Blatch-ford has recently attended. The Workers&apos; Socialist Federation has adopted the name of &quot; Communist Party,&quot; and the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; emphasizes the fact that this change is due to a desire to express solidarity with the revolutions in Russia, Hungary and Germany.Other.Sir Leo Chiozza Money, in the &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; deals with the war-time history of oils and fats and with present margarine prices ; he demands a public enquiry into the question of food supplies. The Merthyr &quot; Pioneer &quot; thinks that Food Control must continue. A paragraph hostile to &quot; Works Schools,&quot; circulated by the Labour News Service, appears in the Woolwich and Merthyr &quot; Pioneers &quot; and in the &quot; Leeds Weekly Citizen.&quot; A similar paragraph hostile to Profit Sharing schemes appears in the last two of these papers.(2) The Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.Soldiers&apos; Demonstrations.Commenting on the recent demonstrations of soldiers, and especially of Derby men, the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; (.17th June) alleges that &quot; the long tale of broken pledges is respon-. sible for the ever-increasing unrest among the troops,&quot; and asks whether every promise is &quot; only to be fulfilled at the cost of such demonstrations as are occurring daily at camps all over the country.&quot;Settlement of Discharged Soldiers.The &quot; Outlook &quot; (14th June) criticises the attitude of civilian workers to the employ-ment of discharged soldiers, citing the experience of a Yorkshire firm where, according to &quot; The Times,&quot; trade unionists intervened to prevent the further employment of wounded men, and attempted by resignation to disorganise the fitting and turning shops. The firm were successful in overcoming the opposition, but with much trouble and risk.Restoration of Pre-War Practices.The &quot; Common Cause &quot; (13th June) expresses bitter disappointment that Labour members should have made it plain that they object to any modification of the Restora-tion of Pre-War Practices Bill in the interests of women. It is not unreasonable that the women should seek assurance that the Bill is to be confined to &quot; real pre-war practices. If it is applied to new industries it wip do something more than fulfil the pledge.&quot; As women are not yet &quot; part and parcel of trade union organisation,&quot; Parliament should show special care to secure full justice for them.Part IV. General Topics and District Reports.(1) General.Industrial Conference.The Provisional Joint Committee of the National Industrial Conference held a meeting at the Ministry of Labour on the 13th June, and a Joint Sub-Committee was appointed to meet on the 15th June to co-ordinate amendments to the Minimum Wage and 48-hour
Bills which had been prepared by each side of the Provisional Joint Committee, and to give full consideration to the questions involved in them. At their meeting on the 15th. June1&quot; the Joint Sub-Committee considered the amendments presented to them, and reached agreement with regard to the preparation of a series of amendments to be the joint recommendation of the Joint Sub-Committee. On the 16th June they met the Minister and submitted to him the joint amendments and modifications which they had decided to recommend. The Minister expressed himself ready to accept all the principal amendments suggested with some modifications, to which the Sub-Committee after discussion agreed. The Bills will now be revised to incorporate these amendments with a view to their early presentation to Parliament.Coal Commission.The Coal Industry Commission continued its sittings on the 13th June, and held its concluding meeting on the 15th June. Evidence was given by Mr. J. J. Prest (Manager of the Horden Collieries, Durham), Mr. Philip Gee (Secretary of the Coal Association), and Sir Richard Redmayne, who was examined at length by Sir Adam Nimmo. A &quot; speech &quot; prepared by Mr. Leslie Scott, K.C., M.P., as counsel on behalf of the Royalty Owners and of the Mining Association of Great Britain, for submission to the Commission was circulated among the members and the representatives of the Press. Mr. Justice Sankey stated that 116 witnesses had been called, and over 28,000 questions had been asked during the enquiry. He announced that the report of the Commission would be in the hands of the Government on the 20th June.Further resolutions in favour-of the nationalisation of the Coal Industry have been passed by the Amalgamated Association of Beamers, Twisters, Drawers and Machine Workers, the Ellington Branch of the Northumberland Miners&apos; Association, the Buckhill Lodge of the Cumberland Miners&apos; Association, the Co-operative Congress, and at a meeting of North Wales Miners. Resolutions against the nationalisation of the Coal Industry have been passed by the Spelter Manufacturers&apos; Association, the Bristol, Gloucester and District Millers, the Bradford Dyers&apos; Association, the Directors of the Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce, the Arbroath Chamber of Commerce, the South Wales Copper Trade Employers&apos; Association, the Welsh Plate and Sheet Manufacturers&apos; Association, the Directors of the Leith Chamber of Commerce, the Dundee Chamber of Commerce and local commercial bodies, and also at various annual or extraordinary general meetings of Shareholders in Colliery Companies.It is reported that much alarm is felt by industrial and commercial authorities throughout the country at the gravity of the coal situation and the dangers attending nationalisation. This alarm, it is stated, has been freely expressed in Bradford, Bristol, Cardiff, Newcastle, Nottingham, Sheffield and Swansea.The Labour Party has passed a resolution thanking the six representatives of Labour on the Coal Commission for their services, welcoming their appointment as &quot; a valuable precedent in support of Labour&apos;s claim to representation of all such Royal Commissions and Departmental Committees,&quot; and urging vigilance to protect the interests of consumers and producers by supporting the principle of public ownership.Textile Workers.A Conference between parties to the Cotton Trade dispute was held at the Ministry on the 18th June. All the Operatives&apos; Unions were represented, and the Cotton Spinners&apos; and Manufacturers&apos; Association was present, but the Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Federation declined to attend the Conference, partly on the ground that Manchester was a more suitable place for the Conference to be held, and partly because the operatives&apos; delegates, * they alleged, had no power either to come to an agreement or recommend one to their members. It was at once agreed at the Conference not to attempt to proceed with the negotiations in the absence of the Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Federation. After some discussion it was unanimously agreed to leave the matter of securing their attendance in the hands of the Minister, requesting him to assure the Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Federa-tion that the operatives&apos; delegates stated that they had full power to recommend a settle-ment, and in view of this to repeat his invitation to them to attend the Conference in London on the 19th June at 3 p.m. The Federation of Master Cotton Spinners failed to respond to the Ministers invitation. The Conference as representing the Cotton Manu-facturers&apos; and Operatives&apos; Associations decided to call a Joint Conference at the Town Hall, Manchester, on Friday the 20th, and agreed that the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners should be invited to attend.(01813) A 5
The Incorporated National Federation of the Boot Trades Association at its con-ference at Cheltenham on the 12th June is reported to have decided &quot; to give all possible help &quot; to the Lancashire Cotton Masters in resisting the demands of the operatives.A sub-committee of the National Wool and Allied Textile Industrial Council met the Minister on the 12th June to discuss questions of apprenticeship in Yorkshire, Wales and the West of England.Railwaymen.The Annual Delegate Meeting of the National Union of Railwaymen opened at Plymouth on the 16th inst. The President, Mr. C. T. Cramp, made an important speech, in which he dealt with the relations between industrial and political action. He pointed out that international relations, the incidence of taxation, and so on, could only be dealt with through the political machine, but the centre of gravity was passing from the House of Commons to the headquarters of the great Trade Unions, and their ultimate aim was the control of industry. On the 17th inst. resolutions were passed appealing to the Government to compel local authorities immediately to commence building on the principle of. garden cities; and condemning the Government for refusing to recognise the Police and Prison Officers&apos; Union, and urging all workers to give all possible support to the police in their efforts to secure justice. On the 18th, resolutions were passed protesting against alleged victimisation of conscientious objectors, condemning the continuance of con-scription, &amp;c, and demanding the extension of the National Agreement to Ireland.A conference has been held in London between the Railway Executive Sub-Committee, the Transport Workers&apos; Federation, and the N.U.R. to deal with the position of certain sections of transport workers employed by the railway companies.Conferences.The Co-operative Congress at its annual conference at Carlisle on the 10th and 11th June passed resolutions calling for the continuation of the Ministry of Food, for an inquiry into the fiscal system, for the repeal of conscription, and for negotiations with the Labour Party and Trade Union Congress with a view to the formation of a United Democratic or People&apos;s Party. A resolution in favour of immediate affiliation with the Labour Party was defeated. Resolutions were passed endorsing the principle of land and coal nationalisation, demanding speedier housing enterprise, and calling on the Union to approach the Trade Union Congress with a view to preventing co-operators being used as blacklegs.  The principle of the levy on capital was not approved.At the annual conference of the Municipal Employees&apos; Association at Leicester various resolutions, noted elsewhere in this Report, were passed.At the &quot;Rank and File&quot; conference on the 14th June, convened by the London Workers&apos; Committee, at which it was stated that an attempt would be made to organise a general strike to enforce various demands, Mr. Tom Mann presided, and delegates from various parts of the country were present.The Workers&apos; Union in East Anglia held a demonstration at Bury St. Edmunds on the 15th June, at which resolutions were passed in favour of an immediate inquiry into the ownership of land, with a view to land nationalisation, and demanding a better system of housing.The South Wales Miners&apos; Federation held its annual conference in Cardiff on the 16th June and following days, Mr. W. Brace, M.P., presiding. A resolution was carried in favour of pensioning off all miners on full wages after 35 years&apos; service, and a motion in favour of the abolition of piece-work was carried by a large majority. A resolution on holidays was also passed, and it was decided to hold a Special Conference to consider the withdrawal of  50,000 of their funds from War Loan as a protest against the Russian Expedition.Teachers.The National Federation of Women at its conference at Leamington on the 10th June passed a resolution calling on the Government to establish a national scale of salaries for teachers irrespective of sex. The conference of the National Association of Head Teachers at Birmingham favoured differentiation between the pay of men and women teachers. The conference of the Association of Head Mistresses, also at Birmingham, urged the establishment of a National Whitley Council for Education. The inaugural meeting of the National Union of Commercial Teachers was held on the 14th June. Walsall school teachers have decided to strike on the 1st September unless the salaries question is satisfactorily settled in the meantime.
Seamen.A meeting called by the Cardiff branch of the Sailors&apos; and Firemens&apos; Union on the 10th June resolved to recommend all citizens of the Empire to refuse to employ any Germans, and all master mariners to refuse to recognise the German flag.Conscription, &amp;c.Bodies which have passed resolutions against conscription, &amp;c, during the week include the National Union of Railwaymen, the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, the Co-operative Congress, the Municipal Employees&apos; Association, Somerset Miners, and the London Labour Party and London Trades Council at their demonstration on the 15th June.Income Tax.Four thousand miners at the Cambrian Colliery, Rhondda, are reported to be on strike as a protest against the arrest of two comrades for non-payment of tax, and 3,000 miners at the Glamorgan Collieries, Llwynypia, have struck for a similar reason. Burnley and District Weavers,&apos; Winders&apos;, and Beamers&apos; Association in its quarterly report adds its voice to the protest against Income Tax at the present level. On the north-east coast the opinion is reported to be widely held that work-people would not object to a deduction being made for Income Tax as their wages are paid, as is done in the case of National Health Insurance premiums, Trade Union subscriptions, &amp;c. Annoyance largely arises, it is stated, from having to pay a lump sum down.44-hour Week.The agitation in favour of the 44-hour week is growing in vigour and extent. The Amalgamated Society of Engineers, the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation and the Workers&apos; Union have all given a clear majority vote for a 44-hour week, and it is reported that they will begin at once negotiations with a view to obtaining this. The result of the ballot taken by the A.S.E. was :-For, 64,908 ; against, 2,599. Other demands for a 44-hour week recently reported have been made by the Operative Bakers&apos; Union, engineers at iron and steel works on the Tees, the British Gardeners&apos; Association, the Scottish Horse and Motor Men&apos;s Association, the Municipal Employees&apos; Association, the Boilermakers&apos; Society, London Warehousemen and Packers, Matlock Council employees, certain soap workers, and Glasgow dressmakers (in unofficial strike).In the Building trade a 44-hour week is reported to have been brought into operation in the district reaching from the Blyth to the Tees. Woodworkers at Messrs. Thorny-croft&apos;s works at Southampton and Basingstoke have obtained a 44-hour week.Piece Work and Overtime.Disputes on overtime recently reported concern Cardiff grave-diggers, Prince of Wales Colliery, Pontefract, stewards on North Atlantic Companies&apos; liners, Blackburn branch of the A.S.E. and the Steam Engine Makers&apos; Society, the Enginemen&apos;s Union (with regard to electric power stations in Yorkshire), and carpenters and joiners at Messrs. J. I. Thornycroffs works. The abolition of piece-work has been demanded by the National Union of Printing and Paper Workers. The question of payment by results is to be discussed at a mass meeting of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners and the General Union of Carpenters and Joiners on the 23rd June. Keighley Allied Engineering Societies have sent a strong protest to the Ministry against the decision to refuse unemployment donation to men who have taken a week&apos;s notice rather than work on piece-rates. 1Holidays. ,The movement in favour of holidays with pay is becoming more widespread. The South Wales Miners&apos; Federation has demanded a 28 days&apos; annual leave with pay. The Municipal Employees&apos; Association passed a resolution in favour of 14 days&apos; holiday with pay. The General Organiser of the National Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Union (Capt. Tupper) has demanded a fortnight&apos;s holiday with pay for the Tay Ferry employees. Demands have also been made by certain Clyde workers. A week&apos;s holiday plus six Bank Holidays with pay has been secured by Reading dressmakers, and also by the Yorkshire Deputies&apos; Association.
Amalgamation and Federation.The tendency towards amalgamation and federation, instances of which have been collected week by week in Part IV. of this Report, continues. The Friendly Society of Ironfounders and the Associated Ironmoulders of Scotland met on the 17th June to frame rules for definite amalgamation, and the Amalgamated Society of Coremakers is balloting on the question of joining this amalgamation, which would thus have a member-ship approaching 50,000. The members of the Sheet Iron Workers&apos; Society are reported to have approved the proposal to amalgamate with the Boilermakers&apos; Society. A mass meeting of the Boilermakers&apos;, Shipwrights&apos; and Blacksmiths&apos; Societies, in Birmingham on the 15th June passed a unanimous resolution in favour of amalgamation. The Council of the Society of Engineers (Incorporated) is reported to have prepared a scheme for an Association of Engineers&apos; Societies. Delegates of the A.S.E. in session in Manchester are considering a scheme of amalgamation with other unions to apply to the A.S.E. in America and Canada, as well as this country. Two delegates from the International Association of Machinists of America are in attendance. The 14 engineering and ship-building unions which met at York last month are submitting a draft scheme of amal-gamation to their members. The proposal to amalgamate on an industrial basis only (eliminating &quot; friendly &quot; benefits) was defeated, and complete pooling of funds is recom-mended. The National Federation of Colliery Enginemen and Boilermen at a Conference at Scarborough on the 11th June is reported to have decided to amalgamate with the Miners&apos; Federation; it was stated that this step would not destroy the independence of the society. The South Wales and Monmouthshire Check Weighmen&apos;s Association has arranged terms of amalgamation with the Colliery Officials&apos; Union for the ssme area.A movement is on foot to organise all sections of the Mercantile Marine into one Federation under the auspices of the Seafarers&apos; Joint Council. A meeting of captains, engineers, pilots, &amp;c, at Cardiff has endorsed the suggestion. Mr. Havelock Wilson; who presided, strongly advocated a federation which would leave the individual identity of the unions unaffected.The National Union of Printing and Paper Workers is supporting a movement for amalgamating all printing and paper workers in the country. The British Gardeners&apos; Association has arrived at a working agreement with the National Agricultural and Rural Workers&apos; Union, and has affiliated with the Trade Union Congress.An interesting and unusual series of negotiations has taken place in connection with the proposed amalgamation of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners, and the National Amalgamated Furnishing Trades&apos; Association. A ballot of the two Associations having been taken on the question of amalgamation, the Furnishing Trades&apos; Association secured the necessary majority in favour of it. The Joiners&apos; vote resulted in a majority of 48,000 in favour, but as the total vote did not represent 50 per cent of the membership, the terms of the Amalgamation Act were not fulfilled. In order to evade the Act, therefore, the Furnishing Trades Association requested its branches to call specially summoned meetings and to take a vote on the question of whether the Association should be dissolved for the purposes of amalgamation with the Joiners&apos; Society on the terms already agreed to by members. As a result of this action, the society secured a result of 5,535 in favour of, and 1,173 against, dissolution, thereby obtaining the necessary three-fourths majority of those voting as required by the rules. It is interesting to note that as the total membership of the Association is approximately 20,000, this decision was arrived at by about one-third of the membership. The dissolution will be merely formal, and the necessary steps in connection with amalgamation will be taken as soon as possible.New Unions, &amp;e.Nottingham Lace Dippers and Stainers have formed themselves into a union, and are seeking affiliation with the Nottingham Dyers&apos; Association.The foremen, roadmen, and other outdoor workers employed on the Urban District Councils in the Colne, Holme, and Spen Valley districts are reported to be organising with a view to better conditions.The North Staffordshire Trades and Labour Council has admitted to membership local branches of the Police Officers&apos; Union, the Postmen&apos;s Federation, and the Association of Theatrical Employees.Profit Sharing.The British Mannesmann Tube Company recently offered 5,000  1 shares in the company to the employees at par.  Only 60 out of about 1,700 workmen decided to take
shares. (These shares are now quoted at 30s. to 31s. Qd.) At a meeting of the employees at Alfred Hickman (Ltd.), a scheme of profit-sharing was propounded, the men being offered the first preference shares issued by the company at 6  per cent. They are given till the 1st July to consider the offer. The proprietor of the Carrbrooke Manufacturing Company (Batley Carr) has announced details of a profit-sharing scheme for the company&apos;s employees.The Beer Shortage. &apos;At a mass meeting at Nottingham on the 15th June a resolution was passed demanding the immediate removal of the Liquor Control Board and its restrictions. The resolution was supported by the District Secretary of the National Federation of General Workers. The shortage of beer is reported to be acute in Durham, Northumberland, Lancashire, and the Workington district of Cumberland, and the opinion is freely expressed that till an improvement takes place both in quantity and quality, men will not settle down to work.Socialists.At the annual conference of the Workers&apos; Socialist Federation, held on the 7th and 8th June, it was decided to change its name to the &quot; Communist Party.&quot; Resolutions were passed expressing solidarity with the &quot; workers&apos; revolution &quot; in Russia, and instruc-tions were given to the Executive Committee to join the Third (Moscow) International, and to local branches to withdraw from the Labour Party.Trade Boards.Lace Finishing Trade Board. The Minister has made an Order dated the 18th June, confirming among other things the general minimum time-rates as varied from k\d. to 5%d. an hour, and the general minimum piece-rates as varied by the addition of 20 per cent, to those at present in operation, such rates to be operative until the 1st January, 1920, only.Draft Special Order. Statutory notice has been given of the Ministers intention to apply the Trade Board Acts to the Fur Trade.(2) District Reports.London and South-Eastern.Unemployment. There is an inorease in the numbers of ex-service men unemployed, although the number- of civilians out-of-work is steadily decreasing. A beginning is being made with public and private schemes. The shipbuilding yard at Southwick is increasing its operations.General. The woodworkers&apos; unions have called a mass meeting of their members for the 23rd June, at the Albert Hall, to discuss &quot; questions of urgent importance in connection with payment by results.&quot;South Midlands and Eastern.Unemployment. Slight increases of unemployment have taken place at Colchester and Loughborough.   From every other part of the area decreases are reported.General. The enginemen and firemen in the Derby and Nottingham coal mines are demanding increased wages, and threaten to strike if the matter is not settled by arbitra-tion to their satisfaction.  A strike would throw out about 40,000 miners.South-Wester n.Unemployment. There- is a general decrease in unemployment in this area. At Basingstoke there is a demand for labour but housing accommodation is scarce.General. The labour situation generally appears to be in a fairly satisfactory condi-tion, although there is a certain amount of unrest in the Cornwall tin mines. Employers in that industry state that they are absolutely unable to grant increases of wages, and both sides are pressing for a Government inquiry into the position of the industry.
West Midlands.Unemployment. The only places in this area where unemployment presents any serious problem are Cradley Heath and Wednesbury. The trouble at Cradley Heath is a shortage of bar iron for chain-making. Wednesbury Corporation have been urg d to put in hand road-ma&apos; ing schemes which have been sanctioned.General. The industrial situation is generally quiet. Difficulties may possibly arise over the question of recognition of trade unions. Birmingham is noted for the large number of small firms in its midst who had little dealings with trade unions before the war. During the war trade unionism, made considerable headway among these firms, but employers are now attempting to revert to pre-war conditions, and free their shops from union interference. Their policy tends to take the line of dismissal of active individuals, or of refusal to negotiate with the officials of the Societies.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Unemployment. No serious increase of unemployment is reported from any of the centres in this area. In the cotton district of Todmorden, where unemployment has been most heavily felt, the rate of unemployment per 10,000 has fallen from 1,235 on the 25th April to 242 on the 6th June. The establishment of a glass bottle factory for ex-service men in Barnsley is being retarded by the difficulty of getting plant.General. The electric power stations in Yorkshire are threatened with trouble arising out of the demand of the enginemen&apos;s unions for a 47-hour week and the question of overtime payments. The piece-work strike in Lincolnshire continues. The building trade operatives in Lincoln have refused to accept a decision of the Court of Arbitration on wages and decided to resume their strike.North-Western.Unemployment. Satisfactory reductions in the numbers of unemployed are reported in the engineering and the &quot; conveyance by roads &quot; occupations. Apart from the textile industry, there are indications of an appreciable revival of trade.General.-rShe position in the cotton trade is much easier. The Mersey lightermen employed on barges have struck for increased wages. This strike affects not only the Port of Liverpool but all canals working from it. As the dockers&apos; overtime strike still continues the position at the port is serious. It is reported that a &quot; ca&apos; canny &quot; spirit is extending generally among all classes of labour in the division. The A.S.E. are pressing for the removal of women from engineering works even in cases where the work has always been done by female or juvenile labour. /Northern.Unemployment. Increases of unemployment still continue to take place in the iron and steel districts of Stockton, Hartlepools, and Workington, and in the mining districts of Durham and Darlington.On Tyneside the position, although slightly improved, still remains serious. Among the reasons given for this state of affairs are the aloofness of employers and workmen, uncertainty as to the fiscal policy of the Government, the restraining effect of the Coal Commission^ wide advertisement of far-reaching propaganda against private enterprise, difficulties in obtaining credit from banks, chiefly among those concerned with new ventures and smaller trading, the inaction of Newcastle Town Council in proceeding with public works,- a shortage of riveters, and the surviving Government controls, especially those which bear hardly on the activities of ports.General. All the skilled tradesmen, except bricklayers, employed on maintenance of plant in the iron and steel works have struck work for a 44-hour week. Negotiations for a conference between the parties are in progress. The resumption of work on the Tuesday following the Whitsuntide holidays was fair, amounting in the shipyards to about 70 per cent, of the total employees. The scarcity of beer is causing a good deal of discontent in Workington.Wales.Unemployment. A decrease in unemployment is reported from most of the centres in this area. An increase of men unemployed at Swansea is explained chiefly by the ordinary fluctuations which arise at a port.The shortage of coal is becoming very serious and combined with its high cost is having a prejudicial effect on the resettlement of industry.
Part V. Disputes. (a) Involving a Stoppage of Work.Goal Miners.Black Country.-Th.e terms of settlement of the strike which ended last week are now announced. The dismissed engine man was to be reinstated in his former position for one hour, with pay from the 3rd May ; at the end of that period either party to give the other 14 days&apos; notice to terminate employment; and all men were to be reinstated by the 16t.h June. The claim of miners who were thrown out of work as a result of the strike to the Out-of-Work Donation, is being considered by the Board of Referees.South Wales. It is reported that in the Rhondda Valley over 10,000 miners are idle from various causes: (a) Four thousand men at the Glamorgan collieries, Llwynypia, struck work on the 17th June as a protest against the arrest of two miners of non-payment of income tax. A decision to return on discovery that the arrests were for back payments, was not carried out, despite the advice of the union leader, (b) Strikes in sympathy- with the clerks of Messrs. Cory Bros., Cardiff (see below) are spreading in Upper Rhondda. (c) Local disputes are in progress at Clydach Vale, Ferndale, and Tylorstown. (d) At Bedwas a resumption agreed upon , for the 16th June was not carried out, because the managers would not allow a preliminary inspection by the workmen&apos;s examiners. *Scotland. The dispute at Polton Colliery, Midlothian, has ended ; the terms of settlement are not known.Yorkshire. The strike at Prince of Wales Colliery, Pontefract, continues. Clothing Trade.Birmingham.-The dispute between the Tailors&apos; Union and the Master Tailors&apos; Society has been settled, the employers agreeing to adhere to their Easter agreement pending arbitration.London. Over 2,000 warehousemen, &amp;c, employed by London wholesale drapery firms, struck on the 18th June for recognition, a minimum wage of 55s. 6d., a 44-hour week, overtime rates and the abolition of &quot; living-in.&quot; Efforts are being made to induce the employers to meet the Union.fBelfast.-k lock-out of 400 textile warehousemen is reported, owing (it is alleged) to their attending a meeting of the Shop Assistants&apos; Union.Building Trade.MarZ&amp;oroiw^.-Operatives struck work on the 14th instant to enforce their demands for a minimum wage of ls.\id. for skilled workers, Is. 3d. for painters, Is. Id. for labourers, and other improved conditions.  It is stated that employers refuse to recognise the Union.* Later reports state that work has been resumed at Bedwas and Llwynypia. f The strike was settled on the 19th June by recognition of the Union.The coal owners are suggesting the introduction where practicable of the double shift system with the view of increasing output, but the proposal will meet with strenuous opposition from the miners.  The shortage of railway waggons is also serious.General-The industrial situation in this area is apparently more settled than at any time since the armistice, but complaints are very general that the men are not working to their full capacity. The only serious trouble threatened is by the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation owing to the employers refusal to concede wage advances to dock pilots, boatmen and riggers in Bristol Channel ports.Scotland.Unemployment. While there is still much unemployment arising out of abnormal conditions, the trend of affairs is towards a more settled state and an absorption of industry on a larger scale. In some districts for example, Motherwell there are no possible outlets for the unemployed, but in other places the demand for labour shows a surplus over the supply. The question of the better utilisation of the water power resources of the Highlands is being discussed.General. The industrial situation remains outwardly calm. There is loud grumbling over the continuance of high food prices, the rapid increase in the cost of clothing, and the general absence of visible progress in the erection of houses, but.-the workers are chiefly concerned at present with preparations for their coming holidays. The only industry in a troubled state is the Scottish shale oil trade, which was very prosperous during the war, but is now beginning to&apos;feel seriously the competition of overseas oil.
Loughborough. A strike for a 44-hour week and higher wages is in progress, and is likely to continue until the painters (the only section of workers with whom no agreement has yet been reached) have achieved a satisfactory settlement.Potteries.-Plumbers have now been on strike for seven weeks. They are demanding a 44-hour week and are supported by the local Trades and Labour Council.Liverpool. Plumbers and joiners engaged in the Building Trade are on strike about wages. Their demands have been conceded by some employers, and the operatives&apos; union is endeavouring to direct the public to place orders with those firms. Local bricklayers have decided not to support the plumbers and joiners, but to abide by the decision of the North-West Area Council, which the strikers decline to recognise.&apos; Spalding. A dispute about recognition has involved a complete stoppage of work in the district.  The Ministry of Labour has been appealed to.Dublin. Carpenters and plasterers engaged in the building trade, to the number of 1,450, are on strike over a dispute arising out of the employment of unskilled workmen.The disputes at Carnarvon and St. Helens and in various parts.of Ireland continue, except that Cork plumbers have returned to work.Woodworkers.The terms of settlement at Messrs. Thornycroft&apos;s works at Southampton and Basingstoke included a wage of  4 0s. 2d. for a 44-hour week. No settlement is reported of the woodworkers&apos; disputes in London, Lincoln or Ipswich.Engineering, Shipbuilding, and Metal Workers.Blyih-k strike of platers is in progress at the shipyards. The dispute is about wages, and negotiations are proceeding.Teeside.-The strike of 1,500 engineers, &amp;c, continues.  The works of Messrs. Dorman Long &amp; Co., are involved.  An offer of negotiations from the employers has been declined. The dispute at Wakefield continues.Falkirk. Pipe and gutter moulders, who have been on strike since May about piece rates, have been advised by their union to accept an amended offer from the employers. This offer may also avert a threatened stoppage in Glasgow.Halesowen. Tip makers returned to work on the 16th June after a 10 weeks&apos; strike, the shop steward whose dismissal caused the dispute receiving two weeks&apos; wages in lieu of rein-statement.Boot and Shoe Operatives.About 100 members of the Glasgow Boot and Shoe Operatives&apos;Society have gone on strike for increased wages. A temporary stoppage in the training of disabled soldiers in the trade is likely to result;Boot and shoe finishers at Leicester are still on strike.Transport.The strike bf Southampton tugboat men was settled on the 13th June on the basis of a 56-hour week.Men employed on the Floating Plant of the Mersey Dock Board resumed work on the loth June, pending a decision on the whole question of the working hours of Floating Plant men by the Ministry of Labour.  (See Part V (6).)Mersey tugboat men have returned to work, but no settlement of the flatmen&apos;s dispute is reported.Northampton coal carters have struck for a 48-hour week, which the merchants will not concede unless the Coal Controller alters the selling price of coal.Hosiery Workers, Dyers, &amp;e. &apos;In the Nottingham district, a strike of hosiery dyers and trimmers, over questions of overtime, &amp;c, has thrown 5,000 workers (the majority of them not strikers) out of employment; 800 have registered for the out-of-work donation. The dispute also affects lace dyers, and a stoppage of the whole lace trade is threatened. .Ex-Service Men.Trainees at Loughborough have agreed to resume work on the 18th June, the Government having promised a scheme of adequate allowances within a month. No settlement is reported at Leeds, where the strikers are to be replaced by other prospective &quot; trainees &quot; from the 17th June.
(b) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.Coal Miners.With regard to the disputes in the Lanarkshire, &amp;c, coalfields, mentioned in last week&apos;s Report, it is understood that a representative of the Coal Controller is to visit the area.In South Derbyshire there is a threat that 117 collieries may close down if the dispute - about wages and conditions is not settled by the 21st inst.Textile Engineers.Textile engineers in the trade are refusing to recognise the finding of the Arbitraion Court which &quot;turned down &quot; their claim to a 47-hour week (as in the A.S.E.) instead of a 48-hour week (as in the textile industry). At present they are refusing to work beyond 47 hours unless special overtime rates are paid, and in many cases they refused to work during the Whitsun holiday, when machinery is usually overhauled. The overtime pay in dispute is about i\d. per week, but the principle is held to be important.Textile Workers.See Part IV.Rent Strike.As the result of a ballot, municipal tenants at Dudley have decided to pay no rent pending further negotations.
