THIS DCCESHT IS T3  KlOP,;.mr OP HIS 3RITAHKIC V -iJESTY1 S aOVERin.;B!T.,s so a ST,-&quot;* WAR CaBIHST.LirUIMTldi, 0fj7ar &apos;&quot;0hic OF GOVmifriaiiT DEPARTMENTS, Memorandum by Sir Auckland Geddes.Consideration of this question is       sufficiently advanced to enable me to ma lie    definite proposals for carrying out tho scheme of liquidation,    Tho Alexandra Palace has now boon evacuated and will be ready for office use in about six weeks1 time.    To accelerate the release of requisitioned premises the removal from Central London of Staffs which may suitably form part of tho Liquidation Department should begin at once,    It should not be dolayed until that Department is finally and formally constituted.    It has accordingly been arranged as a first stop that the staff on^ed on liquidation work which is being done by the Ministry of Munitions, the Board of Trade, and the Ministries of National Service and Reconstruction should be transfer-red to the Alexandra Palace as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made by the Office of Works.The effect of this, combined with the re-occupation as a Government Office of the King Georrje Hospital which will take plaoe forthwith, and the use of tho Barl[s Court Exhibition Buildings for tho Government Disposal Board Staffs, will be to release the following buildingst-Hotela. The Or and Hotel.&quot;-- fjhe st, Erminfs Hotel.Dr Keysets Hotel (Adastral House).The York Hf)tel, andThe greater part of the Hotel Katropole,Museums and^GaUeriesi,The National Gallery. Hertford House.Institutions, Business and other Private Premises.The Institution of Mechanical Engineers, *The Institute of Civil Engineers. The Institution of Electrical Engineers, Business premises In Cockspur Street, and Private houses in Manchester Square and olsevrhore.The work should be transferred in the first instance with as little disturbance as possible of the existing organisation, and, until the time comes for giving effect to the. further arrangements which I am about to propose, the financial and administrative res-ponsibility for it should remain with the Department of State concerned.It&apos;will next bo necessary to appoint a new body to be called the Board of Liquidation, empowered t? take over and wind up all work trans-ferred to it by any other Government Department which has been engaged in work arising out of the war.    Certain of the powors required by such a body will require legislation, and after talcing expert advice, I have caused the attached Bill to be drafted, which I believe will m*et the case,
i79A. C. GEDD3.19.VI,19.The proposal has been approved In principle by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Financial Secretary has approached the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee with a view to obtaininghis concurrence,It is intended that the operations of the Board shall, in thefirst instance, be confined(a) To the closing of Trading transactions in which theGovernment no longer either purchases or holds .stocks, or controls the trade.(b) To the closing of production transactions, in whichthe Government has no continuing interest in tho production Bp far as the particular producer is ^concerned.(c) The adjustment of claims for service rendered.(d) The closing of accounts of Departmental sub-accountant8and Government Agents whether in respect of csah or stores.In certain cases, however, it will be found convenient to transfer to them the general winding up of a moribund Department even though no liquidation of commercial or financial transactions is involved.I do npt at present suggest that the disposal of Government property should be Included among the functions of the Board,    The staff employed on this work is, I understand, comparatively small and there are important advantages in keeping the business of disposing of the enormously valuable Government stocks in centrally situated premises.     It will, however, be desirable to reconsider this ques-tion at a later date when the process of disposal is more advanced in the light of experience gained by the Liquidation Board in the course of its work.The Board should consist ef three members, of whom one at least should have wide commercial experience and another should be a Civil Servant of high standing.    It will be necessary also to have an experienced Civil Servant as Secretary and head of the office, and to provide the best available accountancy and legal assistance,When this body is constituted it will assume control of the work transferred to it with full responsibility except in regard to activities antecedent to its constitution, subject to a Minister who will be its parliamentary representative and who should -it is suggests be the Financial Secretary to the Treasury.It is urgently necessary that the Bill, which it is hoped will not prove controversial, especially if it commends Itself to the Public Accounts Committee, should be passed as speedily as poss-ible in order that tho liquidation work may be placed on a sound and economical basis without delay, and carried to a rapid and success-ful conclusion.    It will also be necessary fcr the Cabinet to appoint a Committee with full power to decide in consultation with the Beard of Liquidation what operations should be placed under the Board1 s control.
