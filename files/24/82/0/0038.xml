ifitWAR CABINET. FLYING CASUALTIES IN THE ROYAL AIR FORCE SINCE THE ARMISTICE,Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for Air.I have called for a report on the casualties in the Royal Air Force since the Armistice which shows that the figures given to the Cabinet and to the House of Commons were erroneous.   The mistake arose from the fact that the original figure given to the Under-Secretary of State of 1,220 flying fatalities included deaths from all causes, including influenza, etc,, which had occurred in the Royal Air Force since the Armistice.   The total number of flying casualties here and abroad since the Armistice up to the 31st Hay last is now shown to be 263*   This is still slightly more than the figure which I gave of one death per thousand hours of flying, but it is of course incomparably less than the figures given to the Cabinet,   Even so, I consider the figures are high and all possible measures will be taken to reduce themo&apos; I do not, however, wish my colleagues to be under a false impression in the matter. and I am also taking steps to acquaint the Inter-departmental Committee on the Co-ordination of Pay with the actual facts as now ascertained.W e   S *   C .The Air Ministry, 21st June, 1919.
