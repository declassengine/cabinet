This Documgcuis the ProrIn&apos;;&apos;/ o u306From Viceroy, Foreign. Department, 29th June 1919. (Received 29th, 4 p.ih.)Clear the line.956 S. Secret. Afghanistan. Following from Roos-Keppel, dated 27th June &quot; Reported by Khyber that lashkars in Ningraliar are decreasing, in spite of efforts of Mullahs and Afghan officials to hold them together by liberal issue of rations. They are now mostly in the neighbourhood of Hazaranao, and numbers probably do not exceed 1,000. A good many Ningrahar (?) have come to Ghura and are garrisoning Yar Muhammad. Khan Fort. All quiet at Khyber, Agency, Kabul, full of rumours of imminent arrival of foreign troops, but none have arrived.&quot; Talk of renewal of hostilities between (? groups missing) after the Id. Donald reports similar rumours from.Orakzai country. In fact there is no part of frontier where this rumour is not correct. A powerful bomb thrown at Gurkha picket in Peshawar City last night and considerable part of bomb has been recovered. Bomb has a turned wooden throw-handle ten inches in length, with a (corrupt group) running through handle and a well-finished brass head. Head of Charsadda bomb mentioned in our telegram of 21st June, 1727 R., has been recovered, and is identical. Bomb is evidently factory made military weapon, not a glorified production. It is of no known British pattern, and it may be reasonably presumed that these two bombs are part of a consignment sent from Kabul.
