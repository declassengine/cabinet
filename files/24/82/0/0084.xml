A note in Appendix X shows the importance oT Che PensTohs^epartment from a spending point of view, and also the continued efforts (see Report xciv., paragraph 29) which are being made to increase the present high pension rate.(2)   The Calgary Resolution.   The &quot;Veteran&quot;, the official organ of the Great &quot;War&quot;veteran&quot;&apos;^&quot;Association of Canada and an ably conducted I journal, refers in its May issue to inhat is Known as the Calgary War I Bonus Resolution.   This Resolution proposes that a cash bonus of $1000 I ( 208) should be paid to each member of the Canadian ExpeditionaryForces who served in Canada, an additional $500 to those who served ! overseas, and a further additional $500 to those who served in an actual theatre of.War, in addition to any gratuity or pension resulting from service.   In the case of a man who had died or was killed on active service the bonus would be payable to his dependants.   This I Resolution was unanimously passed by the members of the Calgary Branchof the Association and lias been endorsed in other places.   The &quot;Veteran I is not in favour of the Resolution,   It admits that the State, I through the Soldiers Land Settlement Act, is giving special aid to the I farming class and that a cash bonus to non-fanners would be reasonable, i but it lays stress on the tremendous cost to the country and the heavy additional taxation involved, and argues that in a short time the great bulk of the bonus would be transferred from the soldiers to the j pockets of manufacturing, land and property agencies.But the strongest argument advanced against the Resolution is contained In the question &quot;Shall the Veterans of the Great War so cheapen themselves as to give a quit-claim on their service to Canada for a paltry $2000?&quot;   The article points out that the man who has served.his country in the hour of need occupies a proud position amongst his fellow citizens., that his service was not entered upon ! from a mercenary motive and that he cannot be adequately recompensed I financially for the work performed.j As a counterpoise to the advantage given to thoI agriculturalist it suggests industrial loans for the non-farming 1 ex-service man.27.   France.   Debate on Pensions.  (A short note in Appendix XI gives the gist of a discussion in tEo French Chamber complaining of the delays in assessment of pensions and of the low categorization of tuberculosis.28.   United States *(1)   Employment   for ex-soldiers.   On all uides difficulty is experienced in obtaining suitable work for ex-soldiers.   In J/Appendix XII are set forth some of the difficulties met with in the %nited States.(2)   Benevolent Society and disabled men.   Before a disabled man can receive vocational training at the hands of the Federal Board under the Rehabilitation Act of 1918 he must be pensionable-   But it has not been possible for the Pensions Authority to decide what cases are
sire pensionable without some delay, with the result that many men appear to have been discharged payless, ponsionless and incapacitated from earning, and not yet eligible for vocational training.   To meet this emergency a Benevolent Society called The Elks have stepped into the breach and have given the Federal Board (the training authority) the sum of  10,000 ($50,000) to assist such cases.   The Elks have also lent  10,000 for the training and maintenance of disabled men pending a decision as to their pensions,   This loan fund is administered by the Federal Board who recover from the Pensions Authority the advances made to the men - if the latter are found to be pensionable.The Elks are also financing a publicity campaign as to the work of the Federal Board with respect to training and have set aside  10,000 for this purpose.(3)   Classification of disabilities.   In Appendix XIII is shown a classification of disabilities of men Found to be pensionable by the United States Pensions Authority up to January 31st, 1919,29&apos;   Germany.   Petition by far Disabled.   The various organizations of the war-disabTed and their Cepondants have petitioned the Government for an amelioration of their position.   The main points of the Government^ reply are that a new Military Pensions law is being prepared (the date of the present law is 3.906) and that until that law is enacted there will be an all round increase of 40$ as from June 1st, 1919.

Reg. No. L/Gen./723/l.    &apos;MINISTRY OF PENSIONS,     g g g Westminster House, -Millbank, London, S.W. I.20th May, 1919.Instruction in the Use of Artificial Arms.Sir,It has been reported to the Minister of Pensions that disabled men who have been supplied with artificial arms are often unable to use them to full advantage, owing to the instruc-tion afforded at the Fitting Hospitals having been inadecpiate by reason of the pressure of work in those Hospitals. The Minister has accordingly arranged with the Army Council that in future every soldier who has lost an arm and who receives an artificial one at a Fitting Hospital may receive one month&apos;s train-ing in the use of the artificial arm before being discharged from the Service. This training will be given at the Fitting Hospital&apos; where the arm is supplied. The needs of men at present undis-charged will be met in this way.As regards pensioners who have been discharged from the Service without having received adequate instruction in the use-of then artificial arms, it has been arranged with the Army Council&apos; that any pensioner who now desires further instruction may receive it up to a maximum period of one month at a Special; Fitting Hospital where facilities exist. These pensioners will not be admitted to Hospital as in-patients for this purpose, but will be treated, as regards allowances and other matters, on the sam&amp; lines as pensioners receiving out-patient treatment.Arrangements for the pensioner^ journeys to and from the-(Fitting Hospital will be made in accordance with Correction Slip&apos; 16 (page 3, par.

APPENDIX XCanada:     Pensions Department,The work of the pensions department is rapidly becoming one of the largest and most responsible of   the Government.   There was paid out last year for pensions $18,000,000 ( 5,750,000).   This year the appropriation is $30,000,000 ( 6,250,000).   If the pensions committee; of the House recommends a large substantial increase, as seems likely, the cost will run from thirty five to forty million, dollars.- The present total disability is $600s per annum., It Is understood that the soldier members of the committee favour increasing this to at least $1,000/ and propose, if they cannot got an unanimous report, to bring in a minority report to this effect.   Such an increase would of course mean a general all-round increase, as minor pensions   are based on.total disablement.   There is also likely to bo an increase for widows and dependants.Vancouver Daily Province. 29.4,19.x  125 or 47/lld. per week for an unmarried man.

APPENDIX  XI, France:      Discussion on the Pens ion Lav;,The recent Pension Law formed the subject of a debate in the French Chamber on May 13th.A member of the Chamber protested against the slow method of payment of the pensions.   He stated that many of the disabled who were entitled to a pension of 5 fr. 91 per day, were receiving a temporary allowance of 1 fr. 70 only, and were consequently reduced to a condition of extreme penury.The Under Secretary of State for War admitted that tho work of allocating pensions would not be completed under 12 or 15 years at the present rate of progress.   He pleaded in extenuation, the extraordinary pressure of work caused by the passing of the law, involving as it did the   additional examination of nearly 2 million case papers.   Pie proposed to increase the. staff of Pension Officials and thereby to reduce the period to from 3 to 4 years,A protest was also lodged against the fact   that tubercular invalidity was frequently estimated by the Pensions Committee at from 15 to 20 per cent; it was claimed that the State should intervene on behalf of the tuberculous.Journal des mutiles et reformes, 17,5.19,
APPENDIX xil l ftt.S,,A,:    Employment of the Pisabled.Injudicious methods of securing work for ex-soldiers still continue) and many stories ore current of men refusing to accept responsible work because they can make an excellent living by pestering people in the streets, offices and restaur-ants to buy papers, buttons or other small articles,      A strong effort is now under weigh, however, to relieve unemployment and to cut the ground from under these demoralizing practices by efficient organization.The Chamber of Commerce of the United States has taken the initiative, in the formation of a United Council for Re-employ-ment to co-operate with the federal employment service in finding work for discharged soldiers.   Eleven great welfare organizations are affiliated to this council, and, at least on paper, have co-ordinated their efforts; each has been asked to contribute $6,500 for the support of the joint committee-.In New York which, as the point of debarkation,   is suffering especially from unemployment, the Merchantsf Association is fathering a local scheme of co-operation under the   general auspices of&quot;the United Council.   It has constituted an Employers&apos; Council on Soldier Re-employment, five representatives forming, with five of the welfare organizations, a joint executive committee &quot;Drives&quot; for jobb in different trades and Industries are planned, similar to the drives made for the sale of Liberty Ponds/  Another object Is that of retaining New York positions for New York boys and hastening the departure from other states of unemployed ex-soldfers who outstay their welcome.Protests against the tendency in national, state and municipal departments of government to give preference to ex-soldiers in appointments for positions in which trained a.ccOm ;** plishments are necessary, have come from many sides *   As   a. matter of fact, the state legislatures seem to be more reasonable on this point than might have been anticipated.   But there are a number of flagrant cases to the contrary.   Congress,   for instance, has insisted that in all appointments for the forth-coming census absolute preference shall be given to ex-soldiers.r,Sur&apos;vey n,3rd May, 1919.I1

APPMDir XIVGermany:   Demands of the War Disabled and Soldiers&apos; Widows.The various organisations of War disabled and War dependants recently laid their grievances before the Government in the form of a petition, in which they made the following demands:-lo     Immediate reform of the laws relating to the Care of   the Disabled, after consultation with the organisations for the disabled,2,    A substantial increase of allowances,5.     The granting-of outfits and payment or&quot; all monies due to disabled men discharged before 9th November,, 1916-,: &apos; &apos;,;:       &apos; &apos;^   &apos;: &apos;4,     An effective law providing for the compulsory employment of the disableda5.     The provision of housing in districts where there is   the greatest need, and the inspection of civilian quarters,,6.     The,Government to provide sufficient funds for the,care of war disabled and war dependants,The President of the Imperial Government replied that the Government were doing their utmost in spite of the enormous difficulties of the moment to fulfil all the pledges given.,   Re reminded them of the great work involved in reform of the military pension laws and the :regulations for the care of&apos;war disabled and the dependants of the fallen.   This work required the practical co-operation of all concerned.With regard to pre$ent conditions,, the Government.were In full sympathy with the views expressed in the petition,1,     Reform in the military pension lews was being actively pushed ;forward and the co-operation of. the organisations of the war disabled and soldiers&apos; dependants would be welcomed.   Disabled men would also be associated with the administrative work of the Care Centres.I        2a     Until the law was enacted all non-commissioned officers and men and soldiers&apos; dependants entitled to pensions or allowances would receive, from June 1st, 1919, a monthly increase of 40 per cent on all monthly payments and also on capital sums granted according to the j Capitalization Law,,   Finally it had been agreed that in the case , of I reduction or withdrawal of pensions and allowances,, a claim for revision might be put forward within one year after such reduction or withdrawal,5,     A discharge outfit would-be given-to each disabled man who became entitled to a pension or allowance between 1st July, 1916,, and the 9th of November, 1918, as well as to those discharged after 9th of November, 1918, provided his taxable income was below a certain limit..Distribution, however, could only be made gradually, -owing to the present dearth of raw material, but money payments legally due would be paid without delay,4,     The preparation of an effective compulsory employment law las already in hand and invitations to co-operate in its preparation Had been issued to the various organisations of war-disabled.
5.     Tho Government was only too ready to accede to the suggestion that housing and settlement conditions should   be enquired into.   The organisations of the war-disabled would be invited to co-operate in. this work also,6,     Sufficient financial provision would be made by   the Imperial Government for the care of the war-disabled and   of soldiers1 dependants.   In spite of the present financial situa-tion a sum of 300 million marks would at once bo placed at the disposal of the Care Centres.DEUTSCHER REICBSAN2EIGER. 28th April, 1919,

Millbank House,London, S.W. 1. On the subject of employment of ex-service men, dealt with in our May issue, further sugges-tion  is  forthcoming that  the Another Appeal, war-promise of so many is notgetting its peace fulfilment. Sir Douglas Haig spoke on the subject at the Royal Academy Dinner. After quoting a case of a 1D.C. recently trudging the streets of London for work, he made this appeal: &quot; When a request for work is made to an employer I would beg him to reflect on all he owes to these men and to be a little patient and try to help the gallant fellow to learn some job before. he turns him away altogether.&quot; Such simple words, almost humble, coming from a great general in the hour of a great victory ! We as a nation seem to have rather missed the deeper significance, the wider drama, the full message of this victory. That, maybe, is our strength. But we can all grasp this simple fact even the money-making mind. The man left his job to fight. The man wants a job again.  Give it him.  Justice !  No more.In pleading for a little patience, Sir Douglas Haig has pointed to a factor which may unneces-sarily frighten some employers. A Little The ex-service man is at first a Patience.     little strange to the old routineand usages. Four or five years of Army life under war conditions are except for the quite young man a big interruption ; the cumulative growth of practice and handiness has been cut off. But the machinery of business or industry has been developing and improving, while he has been busy learning how to kill the Boche. He has all that to catch up. He may feel this consciously or unconsciously. He may show it. Just at first he finds things altered ; methods have changed a bit; things are done a little differently. Hence perhaps a certain diffi-dence. But very soon his old garment be it black coat, overalls or smock will fit him again. His military experience and comradeship have given him the qualities to make good the old nimbleness in his civil job, which he may have temporarily lost. Of course the Alpha and Omega of the whole question is : Give him the chance.Everyone will welcome the appointment of the Select Committee on Pensions and their administration, which commenced A Select its sittings at the beginning of Committee.   May.   The country will welcomeit as another effort to get for the ex-service man all that is possible both in money and consideration. The Ministry will welcome it-contrary, no doubt, to the opinions of those who live by strife as an opportunity to record all that is being done and contemplated towards getting that &quot; possible.&quot; Criticism of the present system there will be in plenty, and rightly so. Available reports testify that officials of the Ministry in their evidence have not been back-ward in producing their quota of it; which is all to the good.  To be conscious of defects is the
first proof of desire and intention to rectify them. We use the words &quot;desire&quot; and &quot;intention&quot; of set purpose for the benefit of those who are told otherwise. After all there is a good deal of &quot;grey matter&quot; official &quot;grey matter&quot; being expended in the cause; and we may suppose, without losing judgment, that this expenditure is towards benign results.Among the first witnesses have been Sir Albert Flynn, Secretary to the Ministry of Pensions,Mr. C. F. Hore, Assistant Secre-Offlcial Evidence, tary, and the Minister, Sir laming worthington-Evans. Sir Albert Flynn&apos;s view may be gathered from an extract from his own evidence: &quot; The pre-war system began and ended with the pension. The present system began with the pension and ended with the man. The ideal of the future was to begin with the man and end with the pension.&quot; Mr. Hore paid a tribute to the local committees, ex-plained their difficulties, and suggested that the new scheme of decentralisation would obviate some of the present defects. Now there is an explanation for these impartial opinions of officials. The Government Office of tradition deals with what may be called impersonal pro-positions. With Pensions it is different. Each daily case-and new awards were recently being made at the rate of about 20,000 a week-is a personal case of disablement or difficulty. The natural tendency even of unnatural (!) officials  is to stretch a point or devise some other means (for example, the alternative pension) by which each man or widow or child shall get the maximum that is possible.-Sir Laming Worthington-Evans, in giving evidence, also suggested improvements and men-&apos; tioned several proposed altera-Personal tions in the Warrants governing Element. pensions, which were designed to correct certain cases of hardships. On the vexed question of a statutory right to a pension he expressed a belief that a man would be in a less favourable position with it, though he did not oppose Sir John Butcher&apos;s suggestion that a pension settled for life might be made a legal statutory right. Further, he hoped the Committee would make a recommendation that V.A.D. and other nurses should be included in the Warrant for Pensions. Here the personal  we had almost written sentimental element may be discerned again. Admitted that there is a mighty lot of forgetfulness of our citizen soldiers turned citizens again : largely, we try to think, the result of other preoccupations. But it is difficult to forget him when you are receiving tens of thousands of letters a week concerning him and his dependants. That is the post-bag of the Ministry of Pensions. Added to which it is the Ministry&apos;s business to remember him.Hence the &quot;desire&quot; and &quot;intention&quot; which may to many appear an anomaly, judged on the basis of the old Government office regime. After all, the work of providing for our disabled fighters must be more humanising than, say, adjudicating on an Income Tax Return.We have been given a mention in a highly-coloured contemporary which, judged on &quot;space&quot;must be considered liberal: other-A Mention,    wise perhaps not very convincing.The Gazette is, however, men-tioned by name unusually. So we must not look a gift horse in the mouth. Just one comment. The writer says he does not quite know what friendship and service have to do with administer-ing war pensions. In justice to the thousands who are expending time and care and kindliness on the affairs of the ex-service man we hasten to give him a hint. The loss to soldiers and sailors and their dependants would have been great indeed, if the activities of war pension-workers had been limited to the bare administration of the Warrant and Regulations. We are always glad of publicity, and if the method is open to question well, each man can only give according to his ability and knowledge and standard. Ex niliilo nihil fit. For ourselves we shall continue to think in terms of friendship and service so long as there are people giving devoted energies to the requirements of our wounded and disabled and gaining friendships thereby. Of course there are those who hate the idea of such mutual friendship.  It spoils their plans.The Board of Education has issued a Circular (No. 1101) setting forth the conditions underwhich ex-service men can become An Opportunity, certified teachers.   The board will pay the usual grants to train-ing colleges towards expense of training and maintenance, and will, if necessary, make, further special grant up to 56104 per annum, in all, for maintenance during training. The course is usually two years. Men over 25 are only eligible if specially qualified. It is an opportunity for some. But the man who contemplates teaching as a profession should make quite sure that he has an aptitude and liking for it. Without these he is likely to find the work sufficiently exact-ing to enthusiasts extremely trying. A daily struggle with the vagaries of the young in search of knowledge (or attempting to avoid it) requires an infinity of patience and sympathy. Of course the importance and we dare say the dignity  of the work is traditional; and if the emoluments are not entirely commensurate with these, there are the joy of responsibility and the interest of training the young idea. Moreover the Board of Education suggest that salaries and prospects are improving; and there are pensions and retiring gratuities.   So there is the opportunity.
The Association of Local War Pensions Com-mittees has held its first Annual Meeting: which does not mean that it is a yearGood Luck, old, though already some 194 Local Committees have become members. . The Lord Mayor of London, Sir Horace Marshall, presided at the Mansion House. The Minister of Pensions, Sir Lading Worthington-Evans, and Mr. Neville Chamber-lain, M.P., the first President of the Association, spoke. The Minister said he looked for help from the Association, and the President thought they would find the Ministry-of Pensions broad-minded and sympathetic. Both anticipations will doubtless be fulfilled. Successful achieve-ment of the objects of the Association is likely to increase the value of local opinion and individual experience on new points of difficulty. There will also be the benefit of co-ordination and unity of method in administration. With regulations become more numerous and complex, this should make for a distinct step forward. All that remains to be said at present is G-ood luck ! though we hope later to be able to give our readers more about the Association and its work, for which the present membership is a good augury,COUNCILS OF SOCIAL SERVICE.By 5. P. Qrundy, O.B.E. .Hon. Secretary, National Council of Social Service.The voluntary workers in connection with war work organisations are admittedly going through a period of transition, and there is a discernible tendency, now the actual strain of the war is over, to take things easily, and in some instances to give up the work entirely. There are two underlying causes, one arising from the change in the character of the work which is being asked of them, the other, arising from the transfer of the men in whose families they have been interested from Army and Navy to civil life. These causes are inevitable. - Take for instance the Ministry of Pensions.As the administration becomes stereotyped and set, the need for discretionary activities by the local committees is gradually reduced, just as the complication of the regulations increases the scope of the official. More cases and more situa-tions are provided for. This is a natural result of older organisation, and one that need not be deplored, provided that the volunteers help is not really lost in the change.The original motive, of seeing that the depend-ants of those fighting should be adequately cared for, which inspired the volunteer, can be developed into another and a wider one. For we must all value the friendships that have been formed, under conditions of a common anxiety and peril which overcame all distinctions of social or financial position, and must hope that they will continue under new and happier conditions. The sacrifices made for the England we have known must inspire us so to organise our time and thought that our care for others, the &quot; friendship of service,&quot; so sympathetically described in the War Pensions Gazette for May, may be both comprehensive and effective in the new England.The terms of warrants and regulations are definite. But the sympathies of the ordinary man and woman are wider, and much of the most valuable work that has been done has been of this wider character. As demobilisation pro-ceeds the problems will become more and more the problems of civil life-unemployment, sick^ ness, incapacity and misfortune, etc. To deal satisfactorily with these new conditions the volunteer will be urgently required, and will need both a wider knowledge and a more elastic organisation.Difficulties in connection with pensions and allowances and the great need of voluntary helpers led to the Conference in June, 1915, on War Belief and Personal Service ; then followed the publication of the Handbook of the Joint Committee on Social Service, which will be well known to many pension-workers, and, finally, the formation of the National Council of Social Service.This National Council has for its main objects :-(1) The promotion of the systematic organisa-tion, both nationally and locally, of voluntary social work.(2) The formation, for this purpose, of organisa-tions in each Local Government area, representa-tive of both voluntary effort and statutory administration.(3) The provision of information, particularly as to legislation and the regulations of Govern-ment departments, for voluntary social workers.It consists of representatives of national organisations, both voluntary and official, engaged in social work-The Ministry of Pensions, the Board&apos; of Education, the Local Government Board and the Juvenile Organisations Committee on the one hand, and on the other the S. and S.E.A., the S. and S.H.S., Councils of Social Service, etc., organisations of women, such as the National Council of Women and the Women&apos;s Local Government Society.The National Council of Social Service has drawn up and is circulating a scheme for the formation of local councils in the areas of Local Government based on experience already gained in various towns. Through such councils&apos; volunteers will be brought into touch with all
local effort in their district, and will find its relationship to their old problems. War Pensions Committees will of course be represented and War Pensions workers should be specially inter-ested in these proposals.Further, a conference is to be arranged in Oxford in the second week of July. No doubt many who have been doing War Pensions work will find their way to Oxford, and, in council with others, adopt a &quot;peace programme&quot; of social service that will carry on and develop during this time of &quot;reconstruction&quot; the voluntary workers&apos; splendid contribution during the war.workmen&apos;s compensation and disabled men.By a Correspondent.Early in 1918 it was thought at the Ministry of Pensions that disabled men were likely to be handicapped in securing employment by the fear of employers that they might become liable to larger expenditure for compensation for industrial accident, owing to the assumed likelihood that disabled men would be more liable to accident. In point of fact experience has shown that this fear is: not well founded. Disabled men are usually more careful in their work, and employers themselves avoid putting them to dangerous jobs. But so far as there might be such appre-hensipn on part of employers it was clearly advisable to prevent its operating in such a way as to increase unem-ployment. The matter was put to the Home Secretary, and a Committee was appointed by the Home Office, with representatives of the Ministries of Pensions and of Labour, which resulted in a recommendation to the Government to adopt a scheme whereby the State guaranteed to relieve employers of the additional cost, if any, arising on the ground of payment for compensation claims for disabled men over and above the average rate of compensation. The arrangements are as follows :  (1) For employers tvho insure against their liability in respect of accidents to their worlters. Such employers will be enabled to insure their dis-abled men at the same rate as their ordinaryworkers.The Insurance Companies have been asked, in return for a Government Guarantee to safeguard them against loss, to undertake (a) that they will not refuse to insure an employer on the ground of his employing disabled men or charge any higher rate of premium to any employer on that ground, and (b) that if at any time they find it necessary to review their ordinary rates they will not take into account the experience in respect of disabled men, which might otherwise operate to raise the rate of premium. (2) For employers who do not insure in respect of acci-dents to their workers. Such employers will be enabled to ensure their dis-abled men only, at the ordinary rates for able-bodied workers. .  . The Insurance Companies have been asked, in return for a guarantee as above, to undertake to insure any employer, applying in respect of these disabled men alone, at the same rate of premium as able-bodied men. Large Firms (paying not less than ^100,000 yearly in wageo) who carry their own liability, and do not wish to avail-themselves of any of the foregoing arrangements, can make a direct arrangement between themselves and the Government, under which they would be reimbursed anyexcess over the normal charge which they may incur in respect of disabled men in their employment.For the purpose of these arrangements, all men in receipt of a disability pension from the Ministry of Pensions will be regarded as disabled men.It will be necessary for the employer who insures against his liability to furnish the Insurance Company annually with a statement of the number of disabled men in his employment and, where the premium rates are based on the amount of wages paid, the total wages paid to them ; and to inform the Company which claims relate to disabled men.It is, of course, impossible to estimate what, if anything, this scheme will cost the State, since, as a matter of fact, nearly all the Insurance Companies doing Employers&apos; Liability Insurance have undertaken to make no claim against the Government for ten years, and not even during that period to raise the rate of premium on account of employment of disabled men.The whole scheme is of course designed simply to im-prove the chances of employment for the disabled men, and not to meet any liability of the employers. A Bill has been introduced by the Home Office into the present Par-liament enabling the State to adopt the scheme and bear any additional cost involved.personal.The Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury have appointed Mr. Campbell Smith, of the firm of Messrs. Campbell and Smith, 21, St. Andrew&apos;s Square, Edinburgh, to be Law Agent for the Ministry of Pensions in Scotland, in suc-cession to Mr. A. S. Orr.Brigadier-General G. H. Cockerill, C.B., has ceased to serve on the Select Committee on Pensions.Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Frederick Hall, K.B.E., has been added to the Committee.A presentation has been made to Mrs. Prince Smith of Whinburn Hall, Keighley, of two pieces of silver plate, in recognition of her services to the soldiers and sailors and their dependants in the borough of Keighley during the war.Mrs. 0&apos;Connell-Fitzsimon, Hon. Secretary of the Pembroke War Pensions Committee (Ireland), has been presented with a Wedgwood bowl by dependants of -soldiers and sailors in the Pembroke district, in recognition of her services.We regret to record the sudden death of Dr. Harold Swale, who was serving as a member of the Ministry of Pensions re-survey boards at Conduit Street. Dr. Swale was appointed by the New Zealand Government Senior Medical Officer and Civil Surgeon at Samoa after the capture of the island from the Germans. A breakdown in health obliged him to leave Samoa at the end of 1917. As soon as he was fit enough he began work on a National Service Board at Blandford, and early this year joined the medical staff of the Ministry of Pensions. He was hoping to carry on the same duties in one of the new regional Areas. His death is a loss to the Department he served, as well as to those who knew him personally.
DISABLED ABILITY.Experiences of the Principal, Electrical Engineer Classes for Disabled Soldiers and Sailors, Croydon.TN dealing with this subject, I do so essentially from the Electrical Engineers point of view. Training is, of course, carried on in various other branches of engineering, but probably a very much larger percentage of candidates apply for training in this special branch than in others.The Man jointing 7/18 Cable has lost Two Fingers and Thomb op Left Hand and Thumb of Right Hand, also his Left Eye.The disabled man is, unfortunately, often regarded by the employer as being someone so seriously handicapped as to render his services of considerably less value than those of the man who is&apos; physically sound. These views have been expressed to me by employers, and I wish to emphasise this point, because it is one which operates to the disadvantage of the disabled men, in many cases quite unnecessarily and without any justification at all.- It is often suggested that a man with an artificial leg or minus an arm or an eye is too heavily handicapped to get level with another man not so injured. But I do feel that one wants to observe what the man with such disablements can do in spite of them, if he is to be properly appreciated, and if we are to properly assess his commercial value.Men with an artificial leg or foot show no hesi-tation and very little loss of speed in climbing a ladder or in walking to the extent which a man in the electrical trade is commonly required to do.I have, for example, instances of a one-armed man bending, cutting and screwing pipe work, quite as well as any other man.Amongst other instances of the abilities of the disabled might be mentioned that of a man withamputation of two fingers and thumb on left hand, and thumb on right hand, who holds tools quite comfortably, and who is quite competent to make ordinary spliced joints in small cables in a reasonable time.A man whose right arm was amputated at the shoulder made a very good freehand drawing, unaided.For the absorption in industry of the trained disabled man, the present time is naturally one of some difficulty, but as conditions become more normal it is hoped that the true value of the trained man will be justly appreciated. In this country we issue appeals to employers to &quot; find a job &quot; for the disabled man. In France, apparently, a Bill has been passed guaranteeing the man compulsory employment under the threat of special taxation for those who do not comply with this obligation.F. H.

Such a lot of examples of this particular failing exist in his-tory. It is so insidious. No wonder the Devil himself has been accused of it, in the little matter of his health : &quot; The Devil was sick : the Devil a Saint would be. The Devil got well: the devil a Saint was he.&quot;And though it might be unfair to take this bit of mythical forgetfulness as the average, few there be of us who cannot recall an example in everyday life and (let us whisper this) in our own. It is so easy to forget afterwards. The daylight is of no account except to the watchers in the night; the ladder is a mere unsightly encumbrance when we are astride the wall. So with the doctor and the dentist and a host of others after the event. After the war any war the soldier and the sailor well, the hand-kerchiefs and the flags are put away, the talk of heroism dies down, and, later on, some one dis-covers that a veteran has died in such-and-such workhouse.   That is as it was in the past.This time we are going to remember not merely the deeds, which will be kept alive in book and story, but also the man who slips back into the obscurity of civilian clothes. Something over and above pensions is required : something more than memorials and scrolls of Honour. The practical welcome back, the helping hand, sympathy and understanding these are what is wanted. War-workers can do a great Peace-service by drumming recollection into all and sundry. Employers, officials and communities can all be jogged effectively. It is so easy to forget afterwards, iIt is not quite ingratitude, nor is it wilful forgetfulness, this tendency to minimise the value of services when the immediate need of them is over. But it is a bother : and somehow he does not seem quite so important the man who helpedus when we no longer need his help. It is like getting the out-voters home after they have polled. Motor-cars thrum feverishly at their doors: fair ladies murmur smiling invita-tions to bring them in. Afterwards some un-willing chauffeur has to be tipped heavily to take them back.Mostly it is only a question of making people think. But thinking is such an unpopular hobby. It so much easier not to remember. Because if we always remembered afterwards there would always be such a lot to do. We might want to write an ode to dawn; or shake the voter by the hand ; and all these things take time. So we forget to remember. Some even remember to forget; but it is of the decent, ordinary folk we are writing.&quot; The men are wonderful! &quot; was said so often by commanders afloat and in the field. The men smiled, a little sheepishly, as most men do at words of praise. They smile now. They remem-ber: they compare and smile again. People now do not seem to think them so wonderful. But nobody wants to be always smiling at this sort of forgetfulness. It is like living on your capital. Also it may be more uplifting to go through life a debtor for things done than a creditor for thanks due. But something on account in this world is helpful.Afterwards must nearly always be a time of disillusionment; and perhaps, in the nature of things, this cannot be avoided. Fortunately for the world it is human to expect so much. But we can all say of the old forgetfulness, as was said when our men were holding out: &quot;Never again !&quot; Of course, Virtue is its only punish-ment: but quite a lot of this can be mitigated by quite a little remembrance afterwards.New Publications.Attention is invited to three recent publications of the Ministry of Pensions.

The third, &quot;War Pensions,&quot; is a four-page leaflet, a comprehensive summary of the pensions arrangements for sailors, soldiers, airmen, and their widows and dependants, including the provisions covered by the Special Grants Committee. This leaflet is exactly suited for distribution in outlying districts.We are asked to state that full particulars concerning the National Council of Social Service can be obtained from the Secretary, Captain L.

DISCUSSIONS AND APPOINTMENTS.By the Right Hon. Sir Laming Worthington-Evans, P.C., M.P.Minister of Pensions,Fresh back from a tour of conferences I cannot do better for the War Pensions Gazette than give my impressions.At a largely attended conference held at Cardiff on the 24th May, I met the representatives of the Local War Pensions Committee for Wales and explained to them in detail the scheme for decent-tralisation of the administration of pensions in Wales.Sir Laming Worthington-Evans.The headquarters of the Region are to be established in Cardiff, in the course of June. Major Roberts, C.B.E., has been appointed Be-gional Director.Major roberts is a native of North Wales. Before the war he held various public appoint-ments in Wrexham and was a Territorial Officer of some standing. He went out to France with the Eoyal Welsh Fusiliers, and in 1915 was wounded, losing a portion of his left hand. Since then, he has acted as recruiting officer, and sub-sequently as secretary of the organisation in Wales of the Ministry of National Service.   Heis wel&apos;l known and much respected throughout Wales.The scheme for decentralisation and formation of a Welsh unit has been enthusiastically wel-welcomed by the War Pensions Committees in Wales. The conference was decided in its views that delays would be avoided and individual cases more speedily attended to under the new regime.There was, indeed, a difference of opinion on one point only amongst the delegates, and that was with regard to the regional Council. The representatives from North Wales pointed out that, owing to the want of travelling facilities from north to south it would be impossible for North Wales representatives to attend meetings of the regional Council, if the meetings were held in Cardiff, without the loss of, in some cases, two or three days. The spirit of accommodation, however, prevailed, and the satisfactory solution of the difficulty was found in the formation of a regional Council for South Wales, which would meet at Cardiff, and a regional Council for North Wales, which would meet in a northern town, each advising the Director on subjects especially relating to their own areas, with power for the Minister to call joint meet-ings of the two Councils whenever it should be necessary.We had a similar successful meeting in Edin-burgh on the 25th of May at which some 200 representatives of the Local War Pensions Com-mittees in Scotland attended.I gave details of the proposed arrangement for Scotland, and announced the appointment of Colonel Warden, D.S.O., to be the regional Director for Scotland.Colonel Warden before the war was a Territorial Officer of long standing. During the war, he was second-in-oommand of a battalion of Eoyal Scots, and afterwards commanded various British Eegi-ments, acting temporarily for some months as Brigadier-G-eneral.On his demobilisation in March, 1919, he was employed at headquarters of the Ministry of Pensions in various departments.The Advisory Council for Scotland will be nominated by the Association of War Pensions Committees for Scotland. It will consist of ten members of Local War Pensions Committees. The headquarters of the Eegion will be in Edin-burgh, and it is hoped that the offices will be opened in the course of June.
During the month of May, Sir James Craig, Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Pensions, has held meetings in Belfast and in Dublin ; and schemes for the Ulster Begion and the South and West Region of Ireland have received the heartiest welcome and support from the members of the Local War Pensions Corn-mi committees in Ireland.Mr. Pirn has been appointed Regional Director for the South and West of Ireland. Mr. Pirn has been Superintending Inspector for the Ministry of Pensions for some years, and has gained the confidence and respect of all classes in Ireland. Mr. Hincks, another of the Inspectors, has been appointed Regional Director for Ulster, where he is already well-known.I expect the Irish Regions will be in operation within a month or so.The decentralisation scheme has undoubtedly obtained a very good reception. There have been criticisms in some quarters that it does not go far enough. In Scotland, for example, what was wanted, it was said,, was a Ministry of Pensions, which should be entirely independent of the Ministry in London; but so long as the Parlia-ment of the United Kingdom votes the money for pensions, so long must the Minister in that Parliament be responsible to that Parliament and the taxpayers for its expenditure.In other quarters, the fear has been expressed that the decentralisation will mean the setting up in thirteen regions of vast staffs, increased by reason of there being thirteen regional head-quarters, instead of one headquarters in London. This fear appears to me unfounded. The London headquarters is now spread about in 40 buildings, and the headquarters staff numbers 14,500. The concentration in one place of all the numerous questions that affect two million people, including children, who are in receipt of pensions, grants or allowances from the Ministry funds, causes a congestion and delay, which in itself multiplies correspondence to such a degree that frequently two or three letters may be necessary when, if promptness were possible, one would suffice.The probability is that, when the Regions are working smoothly, the total staff will be decreased and not increased. iThe decentralisation will permit of local ques-tions being finally settled locally; and whether it applies to alternative pensions, to boarding for renewal of pensions, to appeals, or to the hundred and one other questions which arise, there can be no doubt that delays will be avoided, and more immediate and prompt attention will be given to the needs of the pensioners.I have no doubt of success providing that I can continue to rely upon the hearty co-operation of the loyal bands of voluntary workers which con-stitute the Local Committees.Correspondence.Circular 158.To the Editor &quot; War Pensions Gazette.&quot; Sir,-Evidence has come to hand that there is a serious risk of overlapping in Local Pensions areas by reason of dis-abled soldiers drawing money from two sources, namely : (a) Disablement Sick Benefit paid by the Local WarPensions Committee.(b) The Employment Exchange Unemployment Benefit (out-of-work donation).The position is this It is possible for a disabled soldier to apply at an Employment Exchange for work, and if none be available he is entitled to out-of-work benefit by reason of the out-of-work Policy Book which he holds as a dis-charged soldier. At the same time he may obtain from the Local War Pensions Committee sickness benefit as being unable to work.Local War Pensions Committees can, however, safeguard themselves by asking for the production of the War Policy book on every occasion before payment of the disablement allowance is made.While the disabled soldier is in receipt of out-of-work benefit, he has to surrender his Policy Book to the Exchange, receiving in return an official receipt for it. So long, there-fore, as the man produces regularly his Policy Book, the Local War Pensions Committee can be assured that he is not receiving any out of work benefit. Care must, however, be taken by the Local War Pensions Committee not to be put off by the man&apos;s statement that &quot; although he has not the Policy Book, he has the receipt for it,&quot; for this is a sure indication that the man is receiving out-of-work benefit.Actual cases of disabled soldiers receiving these double sources of income have occurred, and the practice may be far more general than is supposed.It therefore may be of interest to your readers to be aware of the position.Yours faithfully, 1, Castle Street, Frederic G. D&apos;Aeth,Liverpool, Secretary, Liverpool Councilof Voluntary Aid,Games for the Disabled.To the Editor &quot; War Pensions Gazette.&quot;Sir,-An annexe for disabled sailors and soldiers suffering from nervous diseases has been opened in connection with this hospital, in conjunction with the Ministry of Pensions, in Queen Square, Bloomsbury, and thirty-two beds have been provided. The patients are primarily to be those suffering from both epilepsy and paralysis, a combination which, mercifully, is rare ; but in any case the patients in this annexe are by nature of. their ailments highly deserving of sympathy. They have asked for some games.and a gramophone, and possibly amongst your readers there may be some who would like to supply these articles. A regular supply of recent illustrated papers and gifts of fruit, game, &amp;c, would also be gratefully received.Godfrey H. Hamilton, National Hospital for the Secretary.Paralysed and Epileptic, Queen Square, W.C.1.The Civil Service Commissioners announce that the last day for receiving completed application forms under the Reconstruction Schemes for situations in the Home Civil Service, including Class I Clerkships, Junior (or Inter-mediate) Appointments, and Oflicerships of Customs and Excise, is Wednesday, June 30th, 1920, and that no applica-tions received after that date can be considered.Inquiries should be addressed to the Secretary, Civil Service Commission, 6, Burlington Gardens, London, W.1, and the envelope marked &quot; Reconstruction.&quot;
IN PARLIAMENT.]Re-engaged Soldier.15 April, 1919.Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Frederick Hall asked the Pensions Minister if a regular soldier who joined the Army in September, 1898, served in the South African campaign, transferred to the Reserve in September, 1905, and re-engaged in Section D in 1910, and, as the result of a coin-munication from the Army authorities, re-engaged on the Reserve for a further four years from May, 1914, is entitled, after completing twenty and a half years&apos; con-tinuous service with the Colours and the Reserve and being invalided out after serving in the present War, to a pension allowance ; and, if so, what amount ?The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Pensions (Colonel Sir James Craig): In the circumstances stated, if the soldier were invalided out for a disability clue to service he would receive a pension at least as large in amount as that which under the Royal Warrant of April, 1918, corres-ponds to his rank and degree of disablement. It is possible that he may be eligible for, a higher pension by reason of his previous Army service, but that can only be decided on the facts of a particular case.16 April, 1919. Widows (War Bonus.)Mr. Wilkie asked the Pensions Minister whether he will grant a war bonus to the widows of&apos; men who have died from wounds, injuries, or disease neither attributable to military service nor certified as aggravated by such service, but not due to the serious negligence or misconduct of such men, seeing that there is no provision in the Royal Warrant for the grant of allowances for children of such men ?Sir James Craig : The temporary pension awarded under Article 15 of the Royal Warrant to a widow whose husband&apos;s death was in no way connected with his military service is a gratuity, given in circumstances which cannot be said to justify a claim for assistance from the State. It is not intended to be a maintenance grant and therefore is not within the scope of the war bonus.Life Pensioners (Gratuity).Sir Godfrey Collins asked the Secretary of State for War whether he is aware that men who went on active service as life pensioners are now only receiving half-gratuity ; and whether he will reconsider the position of these soldiers ?Mr. Forster : Army Order 118, published on March 14th last, authorised the payment of the- full war gratuity to soldiers who were ,in receipt of pension while serving, and there is now, therefore, no difference between these and other soldiers in respect of war gratuity.29 April, 1919. (Disabled Soldiers&apos; Training.)Mr. Mount asked the Minister of Labour whether any training centres for the training of discharged disabled soldiers in electrical work or motor engineering have yet been started under the Ministry of Labour, and if so, where they are situated ?Sir R. Home: No training schemes for discharged disabled soldiers in electrical work or motor engineering have as yet been started by the Ministry of Labour, as the transfer of training powers from the Ministry of Pensions has not yet been made. Many such schemes are, however, in existence which were originally set on foot by the Ministry of Pensions, and these are in process of revision by and transfer to the Ministry of Labour.At the following centres courses are provided for motor Engineering: Newcastle, Rutherford College and Motor Supply Company.Leeds, Central Technical School.Wolverhampton, Technical Institute.At the following centres courses are provided for motor mechanics: Northwood, Middlesex. Portsmouth, Eastney Bar-Blackburn, Techn. College. racks. Bradford, Techn. College. Swansea, Techn. College. Leeds,Central Techn. School. Batterea, Polytechnic, Crewe, Techn. Institute.

Liverpool.Chatham Dockyard. Wimbledon. Brighton. Bristol.Denbighshire (2), Polytechnic,   RegentStreet, London. Leeds. Fifeshire.1 May, 1919.Special War Gratuity.Lieutenant-Colonel Claude Lo^Yther asked the Prime Minister whether he can state the cause of the delay in paying the special war gratuity to the dependants of deceased soldiers and sailors, and when the claimants may expect payment ?The Financial Secretary to the War Office (Mr. Forster) : I am afraid that the work involved is not quite appre-ciated. The payment of these gratuities involves the re-opening of some 700,000 estates. The cases are being dealt with in their order according to the date of death. We are doing our best to overtake the work, but I am afraid that it will be some time before the majority of the cases have been dealt with.Alternative Pensions (Delays).Sir Park Goff asked the Pensions Minister whether his attention had been called to the serious hardship through-out the country which is being caused to applicants for alternative pensions by reason of the delay in the decisions by the Ministry, and that this delay, which in some cases amounts to six months, is preventing the settlement of our discharged soldiers and sailors in their future careers ?Sir L. Worthington Evans : Owing to difficulties of staff and accommodation, delays have occurred in the past in dealing with claims to alternative pension submitted to the Ministry. Cases are now, however, being dealt with promptly at Headquarters, and delays, where existing, may be assumed to be due to local causes, or to the difficulty which is frequently experienced in obtaining verification of pre-war earnings. The question of local delays is being dealt with, and generally every effort is being made by the Ministry to expedite the settlement of alternative pension claims.Hospital Accommodation, Harrogate.Mr. Lunn asked the Pensions Minister if he is aware that ihe West Riding War Pensions Committee have 150 men suffering from rheumatism undergoing treatment at the Royal Baths, Harrogate; that the men are billeted in houses in the town, and that there is discontent amongst them owing to the fact that they are not treated as in-patients of an institution; and, in view of the fact that the Ministry have neglected to provide an institution or hostel at Harro-gate, and the approach of the season, which will make it difficult to provide accommodation and training for this class of case, he will arrange that these men in the matter of allowances shall be treated as though in an institution ?Sir L. Worthington Evans: Difficulty has been experi-experienced in obtaining suitable accommodation, but negotiations are proceeding for the purchase of certain premises for the housing of the men. With regard to the last part of the question, if the men have been recommended for in-patient treatment but have to be boarded out for lack of accoin-
modatipn, they are treated on precisely the same terms as in-patients. Otherwise they are given full treatment allow -ances but pay 17s. 6d. a week instead of 7s for their main-tenance.Overseas Soldiers&apos; Widows (Emigration).Sir Clement Kinloch-Cooke asked the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies whether he can now say what is the position as regards emigration of the widow, with children, of a soldier killed in the war; and whether she and her children are eligible for the free passages which the Government have announced themselves as willing to provide for ex-Servicc men and their dependants to the nearest convenient port to their destination overseas provided that she is proceeding to relatives and is acceptable to the authorities of the Dominion to which she wishes to proceed?The Under- Secretary of State for the Colonies (Lieutenant-Colonel Amery) : The privileges announced in connection with passages for ex-service men will be extended to the widows and to the children of such men, provided that they are entitled to pension from Imperial funds under the terms of the Pensions Warrants.Sir C. Kinloch-Cooke : Can the Hon. Gentleman say to what authority the widows are to apply ?Lieutenant-Colonel Amery : To the Overseas Settlement Office, 59, Victoria Street.5 May, 1919.War Pensions Committee (Staff Appointments).Sir F, Hall asked the Pensions Minister if his attention has been called to recent staff appointments by war pen-sions committees in which it would appear that sufficient effort has not been made to secure soldiers, particularly those with active service records and who have been in-capacitated as a result; if such appointments are subject to confirmation by his Department; and, if not, whether he will consider as to taking suitable action to secure effective control in the matter?Sir J. Craig; The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. The Regulations made under the Administrative Provisions Act of 1918 provide that the appointment of all principal officers shall be subject to my right hon. Friend&apos;s approval. In cases such as those to which my hon. and gallant Friend refers, approval is with-held and the Committee are asked to make a further selection. Where they are unable to do so the Ministry offers to supply them with the names of ex-service candidates having proper qualifications.6 May, 1919.Disabled Soldiers and Sailors (Training).Mr. R. Young asked the Pensions Minister whether periodical visits of inspection are made at training centres; if so, whether the representatives of the Ministry are in-structed to make personal inquiries of the men themselves as to whether there are any grievances or complaints, and, if not, will he instruct his representatives to do so ?The Minister of Labour (Sir R. Home): I have been asked to answer this question. Periodical visits of inspec-tion have been made in the past at training centres, and it has been the practice to make personal inquiries of the men themselves. In view of the transfer of the responsi-bility for training of certain classes of disabled soldiers to my Department, the whole question of inspection is receiving careful attention and arrangements will be made to ensure that the inspection is adequate. The point made by the hon. member will be carefully borne in mind.Assessments Disputed.Colonel Ashley asked the Pensions Minister whether, in the event of the decision given by the medical referee in any particular case being in conflict with the opinion expressed by the pensioners medical adviser, he will give instructions that the matter shall be referred to a third member of the medical profession for final decision ?The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Pensions(Colonel Sir James Craig): Where the question is one of treatment or inability to work, and the man is not satisfied with the medical referee&apos;s opinion, it is open to him, or to the local committee on his behalf, to appeal to the Ministry, and if the medical officers are unable to decide the question on the evidence before them the man is referred to an independent medical man, usually a specialist, for further examination.Colonel Ashley : May I ask, if the discharged man is dis-satisfied with the medical category in which he is put, has he then got power to appeal to an independent medical man apart from the medical referee ? - Sir J. Craig : If the man feels that he has not been properly assessed, he has the power to go before the medical referee, and if the medical referee thinks he has not been properly assessed, he can again appeal to the board for a retrial of his case on medical grounds,7 May, 1919.Widows and Dependants (Compensation).Mr. Hohler asked whether the compensation payable to widows and dependants under the provisions of the injuries, &amp;c, in the war compensation scheme is less than the com-pensation payable under the pensions warrants to sailors and soldiers ; and, if so, will he take steps to increase the former ?Dr. Macnamara: As suggested by my hon. friend, the compensation allowable to widows and dependants under the Injuries and War Compensation Scheme, which is on a civilian basis, is less beneficial than the scale applicable to the cases of sailors and soldiers by the Ministry of Pensions. Improvements in the rates of compensation payable under the scheme have recently been approved, but there is no intention of assimilating the two scales.Disabled Men (Educational Facilities).Mr. Wallace asked the Secretary of State for War what pro-vision has been made in military hospitals for class-room and workshop accommodation to enable wounded and disabled men to take advantage of educational facilities promised under the Army education scheme ?Mr. Churchill: Circular letters were issued on the 20th November last and again on the 7th April, drawing the attention of medical officers to the great importance attached to this training, and in the latter case instruc-tions were given to Commands that every effort was to be made to meet the requirements of the education officers with regard to accommodation. Further instructions as to the provision of accommodation and the utilization of recreation rooms, huts, dining halls, &amp;c, were issued to Commands on the 14th April.8 May, 1919. Demobilised Soldier&apos;s Death.Lieutenant-Commander Kenworthy asked the Pensions Minister whether there is any fund which could be drawn on for the relief of the widow of a demobilised soldier whose death has been caused by wounds or disease con-tracted on active service, but where the marriage has taken place after the man&apos;s demobilization ?Sir L. Worthington Evans : In the circumstances stated, the man was a civilian and disabled at the time of the marriage. The widow is, therefore, not within the Pensions Warrant.Lieutenant-Commander Kenworthy: Will the hon. gentle-man consider the granting of some compensation in this case, on the ground of encouraging the marriage of these wounded men ?Sir L. Worthington-Evans : No, I cannot deal with it. This case is, as I say, a civilian case, and it does not come within the Warrant.  I have no power to deal with it.War Pensions Committees (Appointments).Captain Loseby asked the Pensions Minister if his atten-tion has been called to the action of the Peterborough War Pensions Committee, who recently appointed an ex-politi-
cal agent to the post of. assistant secretary at  250 a year, an assistant lady clerk at  120 a year, and finally advertised for a junior shorthand clerk and typist, preferably a dis-charged soldier, at 25s. a week; if he is aware that in many instances well-remunerative posts under War Pensions Committees have been given to male civilians whose war service gave them no special claim to consideration; and if ho will consider the advisability of issuing instructions that the more highly remunerative posts under War Pen-sions Committees shall, where possible, be reserved for ex-soldiers ?Sir L. Worthington-Evans : All new appointments of principal officers are now subject to my approval, as pro-vided by the Regulations issued under the Act of 1918, but the post of assistant secretary to the Peterborough com-mittee was filled before the Act was passed, and cannot therefore be brought within the Regulations. With regard to the other appointments mentioned, I would remind the hon. and gallant Member that the control which I exercise over the selection of local staff must of necessity be con-fined to the appointment of principal officers. It would be impracticable to regulate minor appointments from head-quarters, and I must rely upon the committees them-selves to be guided by the same principles of selection as are observed by the Ministry in the approval of the appointments submitted under the Regulations.14 May, 1919.ex-service men (training schemes).Lieutenant-Colonel Pinkham asked the Minister of Labour why schemes of training in electrical installation and retail bespoke tailoring submitted by the Willesden War Pensions Committee to the Ministry of Pensions for sanction on 2nd January and 14th February respectively, have not been sanctioned; whether he is aware that since the War Cabinet announced some six months ago that training &apos;of discharged men was to be transferred to the Ministry of Labour, few schemes of training have been inaugurated throughout the country, and that consequently it is almost impossible for a discharged man to obtain training at the present day; and what steps the Govern-ment are proposing to take in the matter generally to provide adequate training facilities for the thousands of men who have been waiting for months to take up training ?Sir R. Home: The two schemes referred to have been sanctioned. The delay was due, in one case, to difficulties as to accommodation, and in the other case to delay in setting up a local technical advisory committee as is required under the agreement between the Government and representatives of the industry. The transference of training to the Ministry of Labour only took place on May 1st. In the interval the Ministry of Labour has been making necessary preparations, and setting up the appropriate organisations for instituting and carrying out schemes of training. The Ministry of Labour and their local representatives are taking every means to provide facilities for training as rapidly as possible. Amongst the resources at their disposal will be the Instructional Factories set up by the Ministry of Munitions during the War, and the National Factories, in regard to which the claims of train-ing have now been granted specially high priority by the Government. They will also work in close touch with the local education authorities, and will endeavour to ensure the fullest possible use of technical schools and institutions.insurance premiums.Lieutenant-Colonel Buchanan asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether any provision has been made to give financial assistance to those men whose lives were insured prior to the War, and who, owing to their having joined the army, were put to considerable expense in addi-tional premiums to cover war risks ?Sir R. Home : I have been asked to answer this question. The payment of insurance premiums is among the contrac-tual obligations towards which the Civil Liabilities Depart-ment is authorised to make grants in cases of serioushardship arising out of service with his Majesty&apos;s Forces. But it has been decided that no such grants can be made in respect of extra premiums to cover war risks for which the Government themselves have made provision by other means, e.g., by pension or gratuities in cases of death or disablement in the service of his Majesty&apos;s Forces.ministry of pensions circulars.April 29th, 1919. Circular 168. Children&apos;s Allowances, &amp;c, in respect of the young brothers and sisters of a Soldier, Sailor or Airman.tt has been decided that the definition of child &quot; in Article 24 (3) of the Royal Warrant and Order in Council does not exclude such persons as the young brothers and sisters of a soldier, Sc., if ho provided substantially the whole of their maintenance at the commencement oi the war or at the date of his enlistment if later.Subject to the conditions of Article 24 the usual allowances (includ-ing pensions for motherless children) will be payable in such cases and allowances at tho rates shown in Article 12 may be granted to a parent who is maintaining such children, in addition to any pension awarded under Article 21.  It is proposed f .rmally to amend this Article accordingly..In cases of medic il treatment or training where allowances are paid in lieu of pension, a Local Committee is not of course authorised to pay allowances under this circular whore they have not previously been paid with the man&apos;s pension.Any cases to which it is considered the provisions of this circular would apply should be represented to the Ministry, a reference being given to this circular.April 14th, 1919. Circular 169-Provision of Clothing to Discharged Disabled Men undergoing Treatment.(1) The Minister of Pensions has obtained authority to provide great-coats and underclothing for tho use of discharged disabled men undergoing in-patient treatment, and great-coats for the use of out-patients and men undergoing home treatment involving exposure.(2) For in-patients&apos; needs the clothing will be issued to Institutions, and for out-patient needs to War Tensions Committees. The clothing will remain tho property of-the Ministry of Pensions, and patients should be warned that if it is not given up at the end of the course of treatment, the value will be deducted from their allowances or pension.(3) A great-coat should not be lent to a man who has a suitable one of his own, and may only be supplied to men whoso treatment is likely to be pro-longed, and in cases in which it is necessary for the purpose of the treatment or of attendance at the hospital that a great-coat should bo worn.(4) Committees should at once estimate the number of great-coats they will require, and should then forward a requisition in duplicate to the Regional Commissioner of the Ministry of Pensions for their area. (A separate Circular regarding the functions of these Commissioners and their relations to War Pensions Committees is about to be issued.)

The instalments should not be less than 5s. a week, and should be so calculated as to recover the advance before the estimated period of treatment concludes.(7) Clothing may not be provided by Committees in non-attributable cases, April 14th, 1919. Circular 170.-Proceedings of Committees Regulations, 1919, and Model Rules for Local, District and Sub-Committees.Deals with (1) Provisional Regulations made by the Minister under See-tion 5 of the War Pensions (Administrative Provisions) Act, 1918, for regulating the proceedings, &amp;c, of War Pensions Committees, and (2) Model Rules (or Local, District and Sub-Conmittees prepared in accordance with Section 6 (2) of the same Act.April 15th, 1919. Circular 171.-Funeral Expenses of Dis-charged Disabled Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen.Note. this circular is in substitution for the neostyled cir-cular distributed to local committees on march 11th, which is hereby cancelled. attention is called to the alteration made in the wording of regtdation 13 (b) since that circular was issued.With a view to making more adequate provision for tho funeral expenses of discharged disabled men who-(1) die&apos;in Institutions to which they have been admitted under the Regulations of tho Ministry, or
(2) die at home as a result of a disability attributable to or aggravated by Naval or Military Service, the following alterations have been made, in the Regulations hitherto in force :-(a) Cases of men dying in Institutions to which they have been admitted as in-patitnts under the Regulations of the Ministry.The maximum grant payable under paragraph 42 of tho Instructions and Notes on Treatment and Training (1917) is now increased to  7 10s.(b) Cases oj men dying at home as a result of a disability attributable to or aggravated by Naval or Military Service.These cases have hitherto been dealt with under Regulation 13 (b) of the Part II Regulations which has now been amended by the elimination of the provision relating to discharged men. In lieu of the grant under this Regu-lation Local Committees aro now authorised to make a grant not exceeding  7 10s, or the actual amount of the funeral expenses, whichever be less, provided :-(1) that the cause of death was a disability attributable to or aggravated by the man&apos;s service; and (2) that the Admiralty, War Office, or Air Ministry have not accepted responsibility for the provision of a service funeral. The respective functions of the Ministry of Pensions and other Depart-merits in regard to tho funerals of discharged men aro indicated generally in Circular 113. The procedure as regards Army cases is set out more fully in a recent Army Council Instruction (1070/1918), of which the following is an extract :-&quot; A military funeral will be provided where the G.O.C. is satisfied that tho death was attributable to a disability due to or aggravated by the deceased&apos;s service during the present war, and the total cost to the public can bo limited to  5. &quot; All, applications for grants towards the cost of civil funerals will be transmitted to tho Local War Pensions Committee to deal with.&quot; The Admiralty have now agreed to adopt this procedure as regards naval cases with the reservation that it will not &quot;be practicable to accord naval honours except in cases where the funeral is to take place in or in the imme-diate vicinity of a naval port. Applications for naval honours in such cases should be made to the Senior Naval Officor of the port.The Admiralty will also deal with any applications for grants towards civil funerals received by them on or before the 15th February, 1010, and will notify the Local Committee of the grant made by them in order to avoid over-lapping payments.Grants on account of funeral expenses in respect of discharged disabled men will in future be charged directly on the Vote of the Alinistry (those on account of men dying in an Institution to which they have been sent under Ministry Regulations being shown against Sub-head V 1, and the others under Sub-head B, in the Local Oommittee&apos;s quarterly statement of Receipts and Expenditure) and will no longer be dealt with under the regulations of the Special Grants Committee.Regulation 13 (b) of Part II-Amended.This regulation as amended will now read as follows :-&quot; (b) In the event of the death of the wife, child or dependant of a sailor, soldier or airman, a grant towards funeral expenses, not exceeding  5 for an adult and  2 10s. for a child, if the Local Committee are satisfied that the circumstances of the case are such that a grant is necessary, provided that such grant shall not be made after cessation-tion of separation allowance following the death of the sailor, soldier or airman, or after his discharge from the forces.&quot; N.R.-It will be seen that the provisions for assistance in the case of the funeral of a wife, child or dependant of a serving sailor, soldier or airman remain unaffected,April 18th, 1919. Circular 172.-Subsistence Allowances to Members of War Pensions Committees.Deals with the question of granting subsistence allowances to members of War Pensions Committees and Joint Committees in connection with their attendance at meetings.-*May 2nd, 1919. Circular 173.-Cessation of Supplementary and Special Separation Allowances, and of Sickness and Emergency Grants, on Demobilisation (Royal Navy).In continuation of Circular 149, dated February 15th last, a corresponding arrangement has now been made for Naval cases.The procedure laid down in paragraph (1) of that circular for cases in which inspection of Identity Certificates is feasible will apply equally to the Navy.For other cases, the procedure of paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) will be fol-lowed, but the notifications will pass between the Local Committee and the undermentioned officers (instead of the Paymaster):-Naval  Ratings (including    Assistant Diiector of Mobilisation Dept.

Form Db. 1, suitably adapted, should be used. The Admiralty are unable, however, to arrange for the return of the forms, in accordance with Army practice, shortly after their receipt. Each form will be retained until the date of the man&apos;s dispersal can be notified thereon to the Local Committee, when it will be returned.It is of great importance that the Form Db. 1 should show the man&apos;s official number, rating and class of rating (e.g., R.N., It. N.R., R.N.V.R., R.M.) as well as his full name; otherwise the Admiralty may bt unable to identify him.May 3rd, 1919.   Circular 174. Form M.S.D. 13.Treatment Returns onMay 5th, 1919.

War Bonus as laid down in Circular 141 shall be extended until the September 30th, 1919.The Government has also decided to extend the War Bonus to Alternative Pensions as from January 1st, 1919, to September 30tk, 1919. The bonus, with any arrears due, will bo paid by the Pension Issue Office on Alternative Pensions, and by Local Committees on Alternative Treatment and Training Allowances (Article 6 (1) (b)), except for men in institutions (or coming within Circular 155) who pay only 7s. a week or less for their maintenance.The bonus on Alternative-Pensions awarded to disabled men will be issued forthwith, but this will not be possible in the case of Widows&apos; Alternative Pensions, owing to their greater number. Special steps will, however, be taken to deal with every case as soon as possible, and in any case of hard-ship, if the Local Committee will notify the Pension issue Office, payment will be authorised immediately.May 6th, 1919. Circular 176.-Employment of Tuberculosis Officers as Medical Referees in Cases of Tuberculosis.Tn amplification of Circular 117, the following information is promulgated relative to reports by Tuberculosis Officers acting in the capacity of Medical Referees to tho Ministry of Pensions :-(1) Reference should be made to tho Tuberculosis Officer instead of the Medical Referee wherever a certificate is required in the case of a man suffering from Tuberculosis (a) on an appeal for re-assessment of pension (Form M.R. 2 or 2a); (b) on an app-al as to attributability or aggravation (Form M.R. 4); (c) on an appli-cation for alternative pension (Form A.

P. 2S, is 10s. Ud. Mileage fees in accordance with Circular 135 may be paid in addition.(3) Where a Medical, Board has recommended Sanatorium Treatment, the National Health Insurance Commissioners notify the Insur-ance Committee concerned, and where the Insurance Committee provide residential treatment, they notify the War Pensions Com-mittee accordingly. In such a case the Pensions Committee should pay treatment allowances in accordance with the In-structions without obtaining a certificate on Form M.R. 1.(4) Where, however, there is a waiting period before admission to the Institution, or where treatment other than as an in-patient is provided, a certificate on Form M.R. 1 should be obtained from the Tuberculosis Officer as Medical Referee it the Pensions Committee lias no other evidence of the man&apos;s inability to work. Having regard to the nature of the disease, however, the regulation in Circular 150 and Correction Slip 13, limiting the validity of a certificate in cases of Home Treatment to a period of four weeks, need not be applied where the Tuberculosis Officer certifies for a longer period. A definite period, not exceeding 13 weeks, should, however, be stated on the certificate, and allowances should not be paid beyond the period for which the certificate is given unless a renewal is obtained.May 7th, 1919. Circular 177.-Extension of Pension and other Benefits to Members of the Mercantile Marine Reserve.tt has been decided that, as from the May 1st, 1918, certain classes of seamen of the Mercantile Marine shall be entitled on discharge as medically unfit, to the same advantages as regards pension, &amp;c, as seamen of the Royal Navy.The classes in question comprise only men who have signed the Forms of Agreement T. 124X, T. 124Y, T. 124,2 or T. 290Z, to serve under the Admiralty for the duration of the war. The claims of these men were previously dealt with by the Admiralty under the Injuries in War Compensation Act, 1914.The award of pension or determination of claim in a Mercantile Marine case will be communicated to the Local Committee concerned in the usual way on Form N. 230, and, in any case in which this form has been received precisely similar action may be taken by the Committee as regards treatment, training, &amp;c, as in the case of a seaman of the Royal Navy.Pension and allowances will be payable in accordance with rank as in Army cases and the schedule below gives the equivalent Army rank from which can be determined the appropriate rates of allowances, &amp;c, that will be payable.Whdre, however, no form N. 230 has been received, inquiry as to the actual position must be made of the Seamen&apos;8 Awards Branch, Westminster House, Millbanlc, London, S.W. 1, before any action is taken by the Local Committee.The Widows and D3pendants of deceased men belonging to the above classes are eligible for consideration for pension at rates and under conditions generally similar to those laid down for the widows and dependants of seamen of the Royal Navy. Any application should, therefore, be considered and referred to the Widows and Dependants Branch, 45, Grosvenor Road, S.W.1, in the usual manner. Grants to widows and dependants are notified to Local Committees on Widows Form 2 or Dependants Form S.P. 4.Classificat:ok for Pension of Mercantile Ratings.Rank in Mercantile Marine: Chief carpenter, boatswain, chief steward, shipwright, boilermaker, switchboard attendant : corresponding Army rank for pension, allowances, &amp;c , N.C.O.

Circular 178.-Demobilised Men, &amp;c.Note.-This Circular replaces Circular 159, and modifies Cir-circulars 143 and 148.  (The last paragraph of Circidar 148 is already cancelled.) The following are certain additions to and variations of Circulars 143,14S and 159, which fuller experience of tho conditions of demobilisation have shown to be necessary.  The main alterations are set out immediately bolow this paragraph and, following them, the contonts of Circular 159 are repro-tlncsd with these and a fow minor amendments and rearrangements incor-porated.  It will no longer be necessary to refer to Circular 159.A, Durtno Period of Twentv-eioht Days&apos; Furlough.Notifications to Local Committees&apos;(Srd paragraph of Circular 148).-It has now been arranged that Local Committees shall bo informed of the decision in all cases (including rejections) of claims to pension made on demobilisation.Pension Claims (paragrayh 5 of Circular 1.59).-Instead of applying to a man&apos;s Record Office for a summary of his medical history, Local Committee should in future limit their inquiries to specific points on which information is desirable-eg., as to the previous manifestations of a particular malady. The Record Offices will supply certified extracts from the&quot;medical history sheets.,B.-After Conclusion of Furlough.Recoverable Advances (paragraphs 3 and 4 of Circular 143 and paragraph 9 of Circular 159).-To shorten the period which may elapse between the receipt of an application.under Article 9 and the first issue of a recoverable advance, Local Committees may, where the claim is made within three months of dis-charue or of the termination of the twenty-eight days&apos; furlough, sond the applicant to the Medical Referee without awaiting the completion of forms Kncl, 1, 2, 4 and 5, and may pay advances immediately upon the receipt of tho Medical Reforee&apos;s certificate that the disability in respect of which pon-. sion is claimed is due to or aggravated by military service. (As to the issuo of Recoverable Advances during Medical Treatment, see below.)Medical Treatment (paragraphs 11 to 13 of&apos; Circular 159).-The payments to bo made to or in respect of a man and his family during treatment given while his claim to pension is under consideration should be accounted for as recoverable advances. Accordingly, they will not carry war bonus. They should be notified to Pension Issue Office on form M.S.D. 6, suitably adapted.Subject to certain conditions, surgical appliances, spectacles, dentures and dental treatment may now be provided on the certificate of a Medical Referee pending the consideration of a claim to pension (see post, paragraph 11), and after the claim has been admitted lhey may bo provided uudor the same regulations as to an invalided man.-Arrangements have been made whereby a man admitted to a military hospital during demobilisation furlough and unlit to leave it when his fur-lough expires may, as from that time, be given recoverable advances at treat-ment allowance rates on the certificate of the Medical Officer in charge of the hospital that his disability is due to or aggravated by military service (see post, paragraph 11a).Funeral Grcoifs-The provisions of Circular 171 with regard to funeral expenses of discharged disabled men maybe applied to demobilised men in either of the following cases: (1) Where a demobilised man has been admitted to an Institution under the Regulations of tho Ministry and dies there. (2) Where a demobilised man has made a claim to pension (on demobilisation or under Article 9) in respect of a disability certified by a Medical Referee or other proper authority to be duo to or aggravated by bis War Service, and dies as a result of tliat disability while his claim is under consideration.Revised Circular.(1) Circular 159 is now replaced by the following :-A.-During Period of Twenty-eight Days&apos; Furlough.(2) Army Pay and Allowanccs.-The soldier is entitled to pay and ration allowance for $he period of the twenty-eight days&apos; furlough.On leaving the dispersal station he is given an advance of  2 and the remainder is remitted to him by post in three weekly instalments from his pay office. Complaints have been received that delay occurs in the payment of Army Pay and Allowances. In all such cases where a man applies to a Local Committee, they should direct him to communicate, or may them-selves communicate, with the Regimental Paymaster, and, in the event of failure to obtain satisfaction, with the War Office, marking the letter &quot;Accounts 2 (Complaints Branch).&quot;(3) Medical Treatment.-Any man, whether or not he claimed to be impaired before leaving the Dispersal Centre, is entitled to medical treatment free of charge at the nearest military hospital at which accommodation is available for him, and an officer of the Local Committee may help the man by eommu-nicating, over the telephone, with a responsible officer of the hospital, and arranging for his admission. At the same time, the Commandants of the military hospitals are empowered to issue travelling warrants to the men, and the issue of such a warrant should be requested if the man applies to tho Local Committee. If he resides more than two miles from a military hospital, or accommodation is not available, ho may apply to a civilian medical practitioner, whose fees will be paid by the War Office. Doctors so employed should prefer their claims on A.F.O. 1667, which may be obtained from, and, when completed, should be forwarded to, the Deputy Director of Medical Services at the Headquarters of the Command in which the soldier is temporarily residing. The soldier must produce to the doctor his Protec-tion Certificate, and must inform his Records Office that he is obtaining treatment, so that, if necessary, arrangements may be made for his removal to a military hospital as soon as possible.(4) Pension Unims.-Arrangements are now in operation by which all decisions upon claims to disablement pension (or gratuity) made on de-mobilisation will be notified at once to the Local Committee concerned, whether an award is made or the claim is disallowed.A Class Z man who, during his furlough, applies to the Local Committee and claims pension on the ground of disability due to service, should be asked whether or not he claimed to be impaired before he left the Army (see* In some cases these ratings may be entitled to pension as N.C.O. Class IV.).paragraph 1 of Circular 148). If he did make such a claim on Form Z 22, or if, before demobilisation, ho was examined by a Medical Board at&apos;a Dispersal Hospital (sec post, paragraph 20), the Local Committee should communicate with the Ministry of Pensions, Button Court, King&apos;s Road, London, S.W. 3, and ascertain whether the claim has been admitted ; if the claim has beon admitted, the pension or gratuity will be awarded after the twenty-eighth day of furlough. If no reply is received from the Ministry, which may happen owing to the present congestion, then, on the expiration of the twenty-eight days&apos; furlough, paragraphs 10 and 11 of this Circular will apply(5) If the man did not claim to bo impaired before leaving the Dispersal Contre, and was not examined by a Medical Board at a dispersal hospital, it is open to the Local Committee to consider the case for pension or gratuity under Article 9 of the Royal Warrant. (For procedure see Circular 143, as modified by paragraph 9, below.) At the same time, the Local Committee are authorised to apply to tho Record Office of tho man&apos;s late unit for information regarding his medical history during his military service. Such inquiries should, however, be limited to specific points on which information is desirable, e.g., as to tho previous manifestations of a particular malady. The Record Offices will supply certified extracts from the medical history sheets,1 and these if received in good time, should be shown to tho Medical Roforee to enable him the better to give tho necessary certificate. The papers in the case may be forwarded to tho Ministry of Pensions, Burton Court, King&apos;s Road, London, S.W. 3, if completed before tho termination of furlough, so that the case can be dealt with at once.(0) Summary.-It will be seen from tho above that the man on furlough receives full Army pay and allowances and is entitled to medical treatment at the expense of the Military Authorities. Whatever his disablement, therefore, he cannot during this period be provided with advances or medical treatment out of Ministry funds.B.-After the Conclusion of Furlough,(7) Pension Claims.-A man is entitled at any time after the &quot;conclusion of furlough, and notwithstanding that he did not claim impairment on de-mobilisation, to represent that ho is suffering from a disability caused by his war service, and to make a claim for a pension under Article 9. If he does so, the procedure should be, as before stated, in accordance with Circular 143 as modified by paragraph 9, below. If, however, the man states, in reply to inquiry, either that he claimed impairment on demobilisation orthathe was then examined by a Medical Board at a dispersal hospital, the &quot; Article 9 &quot; procedure should not be followed, but the Local Committee should com-municate with the Ministry as in paragraph 4, above.(Pa-a graph S amalgamated with 7.)(0) Recoverable Advances.-\(, on being referred to the Medical Referee, a man who claims under Article 9 is certified by him to be suffering from a disability due to or aggravated by his war service, tho Local Committee is authorised to make him a recoverable advance of pension weekly, at the rate appropriate to the finding of the Medical Referee (with proportionate children&apos;s allowances), until the Ministry have decided whether his disable-ment was due to, or not duo to, his war service, and as to what amount of pension or gratuity is due. To shorten the period which may elapse in such cases between the receipt of the man&apos;s application and the first issue of a recoverable advance, the Local Committee may, where the claim is made within three months of the date of discharge, or of the conclusion of demobilisation furlough, send the applicant to the Medical Referee without awaiting the completion of forms Kncl. 1, 2, 4 and 5, and may pay advances immediately upon receipt of the Medical Referee&apos;s certificate of attributa-bility or aggravation, Circular 143 is hereby modified accordingly.!(10) Similarly, a man who claimed impairment on demobilisation or was demobilised after examination by a Medical Board at a dispersal hospital, but-to whom the decision of the Ministry has not been communicated prior to the expiration of furlough, may be given recoverable advances on the certificate of the Medical Referee pending the result of communication with the Ministry (sec paragraphs 4 and 7).(11) Medical Treatment, etc.-A demobilised man, whoso claim to impairment has been admitted, is entitled to treatment (with the usual allowances) for his impairing disability and to tho supply of surgical appliances, spectacles, &amp;c, under the same regulations as an invalid man. Pending consideration of his claim, whether made on demobilisation or subsequently under Article 9 of the Royal Warrant, he may bo assisted as follows: (I) If a Medical Referee certifies that he needs treatment on account of a disability due to, or aggravated by, military service, tho Local Committee is authorised, as f om the expiration of furlough, to obtain such treatment for him, and (subject to tho usual conditions as regards inability to work) to make recoverable advances(without war bonus) at rates corresponding with those of treatment allowances under Article 0 of the Royal Warrant; and (2) if the Medical Referee certifies that, from a like cause, the man requires a surgical appliance, spectacles, dentures or dental treatment,]: then, if the need is urgent and the man is not in a position to pay tho charges himself and wait for a refund from the Ministry, the Local Committee may act upon the recommendation of the Medical Referee as in the case of a man whose claim of impairment is admitted. The repair or renewal at the expense of the Ministry of an appliance so supplied will not, however, be admissible unless the man&apos;s claim of impairment is formally allowed.Where recoverable advances at treatment allowance rates are made, they should be notified to Pension Issue Office on Form M.S.D. (j, suitably adapted and prominently marked &quot; Demobilisation Case &quot; or &quot; Article 9 Case.&quot; This notification will take the place of Form D. 16, and when treatment ceases Form M.S.D. 7, likewise adapted and marked, should be dispatched.(11*) It will occasionally happen that a demobilised man who falls ill during furlough, and is received into a military hospital (see paragraph 3), is not fit to leave it when his furlough expires. In any such case the man will be allowed to remain in the military hospital until he ceases to require in-patient treatment, and the certificate of the Medical Officer in charge of the hospital that the disability is due to or aggravated by military service may be accepted, in lieu of the Medical Refereus certificate, for the issue, as from the expiry of furlough, of recoverable advances at treatment allowance rates (without war bonus), pending consideration of the man&apos;s claim to pension.* Under a War Office instruction dated April 9.t Lo-al Committees are also reminded that the application to the Approved Society for certificate on Form Encl. 5 must be made by the man himself. The Committee may assist him in making the application, but must not themselves be the applicants or the Certificate may be refused.t As regards the completion of dental treatment began during a man&apos;s Army Service, Circular 106 remains in force.
The War Office lias issued instructions that Local Committees are to be informed of all admissions to military hospitals during demobilisation fur-lough, in order that tho Committees may put themselves into communication with the hospitals or with tho men, and arrange, if necessary, for the payment of advances accordingly.(12) Local Committees are reminded that, at the conclusion of furlough, any demobilised man, if he was previously an insured person, or if on or after demobilisation he has made.a claim of impairment which&apos;has been admittod by tho Ministry, becomes entitled under the National Health Insurance Acts to sanatorium benefits for tuberculosis, and (except in Ireland^) to medical treatment at homo for any ailment. To obtain these benefits lie should communicate with tho Insurance Committee, and pro-iluce to them the medical card already issued to him, or procure a medical card from them.(13) Fiwiewl Grants. The provisions of Circular 171 with regard to the funeral expenses of discharged disabled men may be applied to demobilised men in either of the following cases : (1) Where a demobilised man has been admitted to an Institution under tho Regulations of the Ministry and dies there. (2) Where a demobilised man has mado a claim to pension (on demobilisation or under Article 9) in respect of a disability certified by a Medical Referee or other proper authority to be due to or aggravated by his war service, and dies as a result of that disability while his claim is under consideration.C-Class W. Reserve and Other Discharged Men.(14) The foregoing paragraphs, so far as regards the power of the Local Committee to make advances and to give medical treatment (with advances at allowance rates, without bonus) on the Medical Referee&apos;s certificate, apply to any other cases of discharged mcn(e.g., men formerly in &quot;Class W.&quot; Reserve) who claim disability due to service under Article 9 of the Royal Warrant and whose claims have not previously been adjudicated. In &quot; Class W &quot; cases, it should be noted, disability must be due to service given before transfer to the Reserves.D.-Assistance in Other Forms to Demobilised Men. (15) The Local Committees are only concerned with disabled men or with men who appear to have a good claim to disablement pension, and who may be temporarily assisted, to the extent above indicated, pending decision on their claim. Local Employment Exchanges, and tho Local Advisory Coin, mittees attached to them, are the bodies constituted to deal with the re.S In Ireland the arrangements as to medical treatment at home are some-what different. They have been notified separately to Irish Committees in Circular 11.0, and a neostyled supplement thereto, dated the 14th April, 1919.settlement of labour, and any difficulties arising on the re-employment of demobilised men (so far as not mot by instructions already issued) should be referred to these authorities, or whore necessary, to the Demobilisation and Re-settlement Committee of the Ministry of Labour. Local War Pension Committees aro not empowered to deal with these cases. ,   ...(Paragraph 10 amalgamated with 15.)&apos;/ &apos;     E.-Demobilisation by Post, ,   &apos;   ,(17) Opportunity is taken to notify Local Committees that a system of demobilisation by post has been introduced. The men so dealt with are for the most part those already in civil employment, e,g., men in agricultural occupations.(18) If the men were not examined by a Medical Board (on A.F.B. 179 or A.F. B. 179a) before leaving the Colours, they will receive Form Z. 22, with instructions a&apos;s to its completion and return. Should a man claim to be impaired he will be required to take the form to the nearest Military Medical Officer or hospital receiving military patients ; and if this involves a railway journey lie will be entitled to receive a return railway warrant, &amp;c, on apply, ing to his Officer in Charge of Records. In the event of his applying to a Local Committee, he should be instructed accordingly.(19) Form Z. 22 should not be completed by a Medical Referee.F. Dispersal from Hospital.(20) Men dispersed from hospital centres are first examined by a Medical Board. If their condition does not, warrant discharge, they are demobilised but they do not fill in Form Z. 22, having already made their statement as to disability 011 A.F.B. 179b. Any claim to pension is investigated in the ordinary course on this and the medical papers.G.-Appeals.The right of a demobilised man, or a man claiming under Article 9 of theRoyal Warrant, to appeal against a decision that his disability is notattributable to or aggravated by war service is dealt with in Circular 179H.-Naval Gases.(21) Speaking generally, the foregoing notes are applicable with the necessary modifications to men demobilised from the Navy. Such cases are dealt with on Form M. 1,3, which corresponds with Army Form Z. 22, except that men of the Royal Naval Division, who are demobilised at Aldcrsliot, are dealt witli on the Army Form. All applications and inquiries respecting naval cases should bo addressed to the Seaman&apos;s Awards Branch, Westminster House, London, S.W. 1.questions and answers.Q. 251. A woman, aged 17, is left with a baby five months old, stranded because her husband has enlisted on a normal engagement of seven years with the Colours, knowing that his wife and child will not have separation allowance. Can a compulsory allotment be obtained, and, if so, through the CO. or through a maintenance order obtained through the Police Court?A. A compulsory deduction from a man&apos;8 pay can only be made in the case of a soldier who under an order of Court, or under an order of the Army Council or an officer deputed by them, is required to contribute to the support of his wife and children.- Q. 252. Does Circular 70 (a) countermand previous Circular 70, in respect of post enlistment marriages in civil liability cases? An application was received in October last for a grant for Civil Liability for Rent and Insurance. Under Circular 70 all post-enlistment cases had to be sub-mitted to the Special Grants Committee; now Circular 70 (a) authorises Local Committees to deal with such cases. Can my Committee pay retrospective to date of application in this post-enlistment case ?A. Circular 70 (a) is supplementary to Circular 70, and in respect of post-enlistment marriages gives to Local Committees power  to make grants in certain specified cases without reference to the Special Grants Committee.As Circular 70(a) was not issued until December, 1918, the application in question toas presumably referred to the Special Grants Committee, and they should be consulted if any difficulty has arisen as to the date from which the allotuance is to be given.Q- 253. What are the correct payments of total dis-ablement pension of (1) Lance-Corporal; (2) Corporal; (3) Sergeant; (4) Staff-Sergeant; (5) Coy. Sergeant-Major ? Is the 20 per cent, bonus included ?A. The total disablement rates of pensions in these cases are as follows: Lance-Corporal......  27s. 6d. a weehCorporal......     ...  80s.      ,,Sergeant.........   32s. M. ,,Staff-Sergeant   ......   35s.      ,,Coy. Sergeant-Major    ...   37s. &amp;d. ,, The 20 per cent, bonus is not included in these amounts.Q. 254.-Does the 20 per cent. War Bonus, which was granted on disability pensions last November, apply to a man discharged from the service in April, 1915, on account of wounds (leg amputation) and awarded a permanent dis-ability pension under the Royal Warrant of 1914 ?A.-No. The War Bonus does not apply to such a case.london published BY HIS MAJESTTS STATIONERY OFFICE.
