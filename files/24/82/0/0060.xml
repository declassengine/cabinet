THIS DOGUICTT IS TH^ PW^RTY ^ KI3 BRITON g M^^STY^ ^-of^m^T j .In my opinion the Bill in it3. present form does not remove the present disqualification of women for sitting cn juries. (33 &amp; 34.. V.&apos; 0 77. 6 5) .   It is a general rule of construction that an Act -dealing&apos;specially Tri-th a particular subject is not to be deemed repealed by.a-subsequent enactment of a general, nature, unless there is some expreso reference to.the previous&apos; special legislation, or some necessary inconsistency in the two Aots standing together (see e.g. Thorpe v Adams. L.R. 6 CP. p 125; Seward v Vera Cruz. 10 A.C. 59 at p 68; Doods v Shepherd. 1 Ex      p 75).   If the Juries Act is not referred to expressly by the Bill, I think, the disqualification expressed in section 5 would be taken to be an exception to the general provision cf the Bill.SinX DIS QJJ VI Iff 10 AT I OH ( ^roVAL).
