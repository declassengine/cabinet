HERRING PISHING INDUSTRY.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.It does not seem to be intended that Ireland should share in the proposed guarantee referred to in the Memorandum of the 3rd instant presented to the War Cabinet by the President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary for Scotland.     In the view of the Irish Government the terms of the guarantee should be extended to Ireland so that herrings cured in this country should rank equally with those cured elsewhere in the United Kingdom for inclusion :in the limited barrelage of 400,000 barrels.sIn support of the contention that Ireland should beincluded, I would point out:-(l) that a considerable proportion of the herrings normally cured on the Irish Coast have been Cured by Scottish curers, and that those cured by Irish curers went to the same markets as these and (so far as the Baltic markets are concerned) were probably despatched to the same buyer and in the same shipj(2) that the grades of iish were the same as those produced on the East Coast of Scotland;(3) that the branding regulations of the Irish FisheryAuthority ( the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction) were practically identical with those for the Scottish Crown Brand, and that their staff is fully competent to deal with the necessary in-spection and valuation.,   \(Intd) I.M,18th June, 1919.
