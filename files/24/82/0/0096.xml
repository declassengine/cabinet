1/1 - &apos; MINISTRY OF SHIPPING. &quot; &apos; ^ J &apos;      ;&apos;&quot;\.....w&quot;   Position of the White Star and Associated Fleets.]f0 It is generally known that practically the whole of theinaneial interest in the White Star and Allied Lines is held indirectly through the International Navigation Company) by an American Corporation -he International Mercantile Marine Corporation of New Jersey.   These Irrangoments were originally negotiated by Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan in ,902.   It was seen, however, that whatever the Intentions of the promoters, he status cf the various companies&apos; fleets as British ships might be eribusly effected.   An agreement was accordingly entered into in August 905, between the British Government, represented by&apos;thevAdmiralty and the oard of Trade, of the first part, the International Mercantile. Marine Co. f the second part, and the International. Navigation Co. and the various iner companies, of the third part.   Under this agreement the British overnment undertook not to differentiate against the vessels of the various companies in favour of other British companies..   In return the ompanies agreed not to transfer any of their vessels from the British egister without the written consent of the British Government, and gave 0 the Admiralty the right to purchase, or hire at any time during the 0tttinuance of the agreement any British ship from, the combine on terms ,0 be settled by arbitration in default of agreement.   The agreement was ,0 last for 20 years, until September 1922, and thereafter, subject to five years notice on either side.Passing/
Passing now to more recent times, in 1915 the Internationallercantlle Marine Corporation got into financial difficulties and its $took: largely changed hands.   It was accordingly considered desirable toake steps to safeguard the British interest in maintaining in British sands effective control over the tonnage owned by the associated lines, jr. Harold Sanderson one of the London directors visited New York and succeeded in obtaining in May 1916 the assent of the American stock holders to a proposition stipulating that the effective control over the vessels should be vested in the London Boards and that a proportion I of the directors of the International Mercantile Marine Corporation, as well as of the British? Companies should be appointed subjected to the approval of the British Government.   This was satisfactory as far as it TOnt, but in 1917 difficulties began to arise from a conflict of policy between the British Directors and the American financial interests, and an attempt to secure formal confirmation of the understanding reached in 1916 was unsuccessful.: - . . - - - &apos;The British Liner Companies, being primarily interested in thecontinuity and success of tho ventures as shipping lines, wereaccumulating large reserves to replace tonnage lost in the war, and byrefraining from declaring large dividends were limiting the returnReived by the ^nerican bond holders on their capital.   The policy&amp;d.opted oy the british companies in the combine was consonant with thatg - adopted/
jpted by other British steamship companies of high standing)   Further-Jre, the agreement was due to run out in September 1922 if notice was tti&amp;n and it was anticipated that the then American financial interestsacerned would assert their position and secure the transfer of the sels to the American flag and the investment of the&apos;reserves in eric an shipping..It was accordingly thought desirable to encourage negotiations,once for the transfer to British interests of the American financialjsklings.   A British syndicate, with the approval of the Treasuryd the Ministry of Shipping, made an offer to the American bond holders .tiich was virtually accepted, but, at the last moment, the United Statesoyernment, although they had been kept advised of the progress of thefigotiations, vetoed the transaction and offered to take over from therivate holders, on terms not less favourable than those offered by theIrtish syndicate.   This happened in November, 1918.The situation thus created was fraught with grave danger.   Ittoeatened a condition of affairs in which the British Government control-cd and taxed a large block of tonnage ultimately owned by the Americangovernment.   Political friction could not fail to follow and a strongtenand, on the part of America, for the transfer of the vessels to thetoe^can flag appeared inevitable. The British Government, however,- 3 - possessed/
assessed the strong&apos;Iberer of its right of pre-emption, under the greement of 1905.   The attention of the Chairman of the United States hipping Board was called to this fact by the Shipping Controller and he as oatagorioally informed that the British Government  &apos;ould be&apos; ompelled in the event of the negotiations going through to exercise ts right under the Agreement&apos;.   &amp;s a result of this step, the United itates Shipping Board retracted and, on the 1st April, 1919, advised the Itock-holdere that they could not consider further-er the acquisition of toeir holdings and that the latter vere free to deal with the properties as they considered desirable.Negotiations were thereupon re-opened for the purchase of the holdings by the British syndicate.   The negotiations again reached an advanced stage and all parties were under the impression that the deal had virtually gone through.   It has, however, just transpired that difficulties have again arisen at the eleventh hour and that the shareholders have declined by a large majority to ratify the arrangement, t j which, it should be pointed out, the American directors were already/- fully committed.   It &apos;seems clear, however, that there is some agency at work determined to frustrate all attempts to confirm the true British character of these important lines.!q The lines concerned are the Oceanic Steam Navigation Co.(whiteStar), Frederick Ley land k Co./., the British and VJorth Atlantic Steam- 4 - Navigation/
avigation Co., the Mississippi and Dominion S.8.C0,, and the Atlantictransport Co.   Their fleets comprise about 800,000 tons of the bestlass of tonnage have been particularly heavy and, owing to the exigen-ies of the tonnage position, practically no new tonnage of this class as been built.   Before the war the American flag tonnage of this 1C3S on the North Atlantic was insignificant in amount.   There was, owever, a considerable block of first class German passenger tonnage n U.S. ports and the recent insistance by the Americans in Paris on the emand put forward by them that they should be allowed to retain all the inemy tonnage seized in their ports on the declaration of war by theI.S* will give them over 400,000 tons of Passenger tonnage.The following statement indicates the disproportionate tanner in which the American mercantile marine has increased during thettlss of passenger tonnage.   During the war British losses in thisJar j -31st July 191931st March 1919. excluding capt-used and detained vessels.31st March 1919 plus anticipated share of German &amp; Austrian tonnage each allied state retaining its captured and detained enemy vessels.GUBritain18,472,000 GT15,044,000 G.T.18,266,000 G.T.&amp;.S.A.1,700,000 GT5,899,000 G.T.6,530,000 G.T,The nett loss in British Passenger tonnage (1600 tons gross andalone0ver) since June 1916,/is 986,000 tons gross.- 5 -it is/
It is therefore of the utmost importance to prevent any possibility of the loss to the British flag of the 300,000 tons con-$olled by the International Mercantile Marino Company, apart altogether from the loss of the reserves belonging to the Companies, Yftiichotherwise will be invested in further first class passenger tonnage for the British register.As, however, neither side has given notice of termination,xthe agreement must (on the interpretation hitherto -adopted) continue in force for at least another five years during v/hich the BritishGovernment are entitled to exercise considerable control over theconstitution of the London Boards and of the Board of. the InternationalMercantile Marine Corporation.   The question which arises and whichthe Shipping Controller desires to submit for the consideration of theWar Cabinet is whether for the time being there is any necessity fortho Government to take action to demonstrate unequivocally their-determination not to allow this tonnage to be lost to the British flagsIn the last resort the only effective course would be to take advantageor the right of pre-emption secured under the agreement.; and in view ofthe international difficulties to which any action of this sort might give rise at the present time, the Shipping Controller   is on the thcloinclined to the opinion that the situationihould merely be carefullypatched so that any step taken by America which may appear to undermine the position of the British Government may be at once reported to    c- 6 - the Cabinet/
the Cabinet with a view to such action as may be appropriate in the ircumstances of the time.1st July.x      The clause in question runs as follows.&quot;This agreement shall have effect for 20 years from the 27th September, &quot;1902 and shall continue in force thereafter subject to a notice of five &quot;years on either side (which may be given during the continuance of this &quot;agreement^provided that His Majesty&apos;s Government shall have the right &quot;to terminate this agreement at any time if the Association pursue a &quot;policy injurious to the interests of the British Mercantile Marine or &quot;British trade.&quot;p;?^:;-:^-::.-::1;^:V&apos;&apos;:&apos;::k-^&apos;.; -^-&quot;::WY- Y]-t\.v-&apos;^^t;:v^V:^.:::^:^&quot;^:&apos;^^&apos;&apos;v&apos;^::.^^^v&apos;:^^:&apos;&apos; -::;---v:&apos;-;---:&apos;&apos;,^-^YYYY::.:-:y:-Y^Y:^^ The wording of the clause is unusual and is possibly open tothe interpretation that five years notice of continuation is contemplat-ed*   The interpretation hitherto adopted is that the agreement runson continuously until one side has given five years notice of a desireto terminate.
