HOLDING OF LAND AND CARRYING ON OF BUSINESS BY GERMANS AND OTHER FORMER ALIEN ENEMIES.

(Circulated by the Home Secretary)

The following amendment has been put down by six members for the Committee stage of the Aliens Restriction Bill which is to be taken on Tuesday -

(1) No former enemy alien shall be entitled, either in his own name or through the intervention of a trustee to esquire or to hold any land or interest in land in the United kingdom, or to carry on, either alone or jointly with any other person or persons, any business in the United Kingdom which may from time to time be certified by the President of the Board of Trade to be a key industry, or to hold any share or shares in any Company carrying on such business, or in any Company owning a British ship or ships.

(2) Any land or interest in land, and any such business or share in any such business as is mentioned in this section, and any share or shares in such company as is mentioned in this section which are at the time of the passing of this Act or may hereafter be hold by or in trust for a former alien enemy shall, upon an application being made to the Court in the prescribed manner, be vested in the Public Trustee, and shall be dealt with by him in such manner as may be determined by Parliament..

(3) The Provisions of the section shall not apply to any former alien enemy who may be certified by the Secretary of State to be a member of a nation or race hostile to the states recently at war with His Majesty and to be well disposed to His Majesty and his Government.

1. There appear to be two general objections to the amendment:

(a) It is proposed by an addition to what is on the face of it intended to be temporary legilsation, a fundamental alteration in the law with regard to the holding of land in the United Kingdom, orginally en?oted by the Naturalisation Act, 1870, and now contained in section 17 of the British Nationality and status of Aliens Act, 1914, and in the general principle of ? law by which aliens are permitted to do business freely in this country.

(b) It makes for the first time, it is believed, in British law distinction between different classes of aliens with regard to their legal rights.

2. As to (A) it may be observed that this is a Bill intended to prolong for a period of one year the power of the Secretary of State to impose special precautionary restrictions on aliens and it may be doubted whether legislation of a permanent kind as to the rights and capacities of aliens and British subjects can properly be introduced into this Bill.

3. As to (b) the proposal to inflict special disqualifications upon the subjects of States recently at war with us, clearly raises an international   
question of the very first&apos;laportarwe and is *ne on whioh the Foreign Offioe would no doubt wish to bo consulted.    Any sitofr disqualification, if adopted, ^ould not fail to have a very important hearing on the question of our future relations with Germany, Austria * Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey and their admis-sioa to J*he League of Nations.     So far as can bo asoortained on a hasty enquiryJ&amp;11 the. countries mentioned allow British subjects to hold land and to trade freely;   and it may be a matter for consideration aa ti how far it will be open under the terms of peace for all or any of those countries to. adopt retaliatory measures.i, Tho general question of the holding of land by aliens was raised inParliament:ae recently as July, 1918, when tho British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1918, was under consideration and an amendment excluding aliens from holding land was negatived without a division (Parliamentary Debates 1918 Volume 108, page 1191). The general question whether aliens of any kind should be permitted tohold land is clearly one of groat importance and if prohibitory legislation to this effect is desired it should, it is suggested, be brought forward  . by way of amendment to tho British Nationality Act of 1914, .   Such legis?-lation will require careful drafting;   it is conceived that a, mere repeal of the existing statutory law and a restoration of the Common Law would not achieve the object aimed at.    It is understood that in practice under the law as it existed before 1870 an alien could to a considerablo extent enjoy . . the advantages of holding land.inasmuch as ho oould not be dispoosessed except by the Crown upon office found.    It may also bo observed that the amendment as drawn gees beyond even the most anoient law by forbidding enemy alien merchants to hold even a short    lease, &apos;6. In so far as the amendment is directed to the removing any nationa?^ , , ,danger which might result from the holding sf land by a person of former enemy nationality at a stratogio point, the order whioh it is proposed to make under the Bill contains a provision as to what are called &quot;protected areas&quot;, - i,o. areas-that aro to be delimited on the reoonmendation of tho War Offioe and tho Admiralty and in those areas it i3 proposed to take power to prevent any alien or any olass of alien from acquiring land or any interest in land.7. Attention nay be called to tho effect of the third paragraph of theproposed Clause.. .  Another amendment whioh has been put down to the Bill by,the promotion of this Clause defines former enemy aliens in such a manner as to insludo all persons who at tho beginning cf tho war were subjeots of enemy States and at thus to comprise Prussian and Austrian Poles, Czoohs, Jugo-Slaves, Alsacians, Schleswigers, etc.    Thus the ... effeVt cf a third sub-Clause is to require a Secretary of State to give- .    -a certificate as to the sentiments of persons who are the subjects.of allied . and friendly States, members of the League of Nations, and to prohibit the holding land unless suoh a certificate 5s givon.I propose, if my colleagues agree, to oppose the Clause.June 28th, 1919. hj,s.
