In London the extremists have been devoting all their energies to engineering a General Strike for Monday next.   The extent of their suocsss will show what influenoe they really have, especially as the labour Party has refused to participate.   The struggle between the official Trade Union leaders and the self-constituted leaders is growing.   Shop Stewards seem to realize that they must concentrate,onrindustrial questions and leave foreign politios alone.   Trade Union rules are causing disocntont among discharged soldiers, many of whom are unskilled, and it seems probable  that the passing of the Pre-V&amp;r Practices Restoration (No. 3) Bill will acoentuate their grievances. &apos;&apos; ,There is no abatement in the agitation against Conscription * and the Inoome Tax,The demand for control of prices during the ooming winter seems to be growing.
THJ3 police the Police Union has definitely lost ground.    In Liverpool and manchester there is a strong feeling against it, and the Liverpool Brunch oppose affiliation with any Trades Union,.   The Exeoutive.of the&apos;Union is fighting for its life, and if it fails to secure the oo*-opsration of the Triple Alliance it will turn to the National Federation of Discharged Sailors,find Soldiers,    Very many members in the Innor Divisions in London have resigned, and the Union is only supported by Police.stationed in the Outer Divisions.    My correspondent.reports that the members of the Miners&apos; &amp; Transport Workers&apos; Unions at Preston are not entirely in sympathy with their leaders and do not wish to support the Police Union. .. &apos;.RIOT AT 5PS0M OH THS 17th.- There was nothing political about the riot in whioh a Police Sergeant was killed last night.     It was the old story of an attempted rescue of two Canadian soldiers who had been detained for escort,    Beveral Canadian soldiers who demonstrated outside the Police Station wero dispersed. They returned to the camp, a bugler sounded the &quot;Assembly&quot; and about 400 soldiers paraded and marohed to the Epsom Polioe Station, where they demanded the release of the detained men.    On this being refused, they broke, down the railings, smashed the windows and released their oomrades. Twelve Polioe pffioera were injured, more or less severely. Station Sergeant Green died this morning as a result of his injuries.    A large number of soldiers were also injured.THE-HOUSING jgjgipft&apos;.The extremists continue to exploit the delay in :. house-building and say that nothing will be done until the Government&apos;&apos;s hand is forced.    They point to the ereotionof/
of oinematograph houses and large shops as a proof that ^ the available material is being used for the capitalists, ILIQUOR CONTROL, IThere was a mass meeting at Nottingham on June .15th, to demand the abolition of liquor control, at whioh three members of Parliament were present.    &quot;Control?M said the ohairman of the Disoharged Soldiers,.&quot;If they don*t take care they will control this oountry into a revolution.&quot; But in the next breath he was urging that unless food prices were controlled we should have &quot;one of the reddest revolutions this&apos; oountry has ever seen.&quot;    What the meeting really Wanted was the pre-war supply of beer in. quantity and quality.In Liverpool the situation has been relieved by a greater supply and the abolition of the No-Treating &quot; Order.    In the Tyneside district protest meetings are being hold against the olosing of publio houses, and the local magistrates appear to have given way to the extent of direoting that the publio houses should be. kept open during the legal hours,    At Nottingham and Leicester a strong feeling prevails and it is oomplioated by. the wide-spread belief that the high prioes are due to profiteering.RACE RIOTS. .        -The Colour-Bar feeling appears,to be growing in Liverpool and Cardiff, and it is suggested that the presence of Colonial and American troops is portly responsible for it.    In the present state of tension riots like that at Cardiff last week may take plaoe at any time.The &quot;Sooiety of Peoples of african Origin&quot; held a -meeting in Hyde Park on the 14th June, attended by about ^3,000/
i3,000 people, of whom 300 were negroes.    They oalled upon the Government to protect men of colour as members of the Empire,THE VICTORY LOAN.There appears to be some feeling against the Viotory Loan.    At a meeting at Nottingham Sir John RSBS, M,P. was interrupted by discharged soldiers whose ory was, &quot;More Beer, less Loan.&quot;    There was a small meeting at Bermondsey where one of the speakers tried to show that the workers would have to pay the interest by working longer hours for lower wages,UNBSST AMONG SEAMEN.On the 23rd May there was a seoret meeting of the delegates of the Miners, the Transport Workers, and the Seamen&apos;s unions at Southporb, to arrange for a Seamen&apos;s Strike for an eight hour day on board ship.    The plan is that on a given date all British seamen shall refuse to man ship until their demands are granted,TRADES UNION CONFERENCE AT BRADFORD.300 delegates from Yorkshire Unions met at Bradford on the 14th, under the presidenoy of Alderman Ben TURNER of the Independent Labour Party and the Textile Workers.    In his address TURNER said, &quot;The workers would be justified in ceasing all work until Churchill is cleared out and our men brought back out of Russia,.,,., Men had been sent to Russia beoause some of our rulers feared that their investments were in danger, and somebody deserved hangingfor this business......We workers want the abolition ofoonsoriptionj   disarmament and freedom, not revolution of blood.&quot;A/
A resolution for a&quot; strike if the troops were not brought back from Russia was referred -back.to the branohesHE3VOLUTTQNARY LtTERATUKE.A new order has now been circulated by the extremist! that no literature is to be given away, sinoe it is always alleged that gratuitous literature is printed with funds furnished by the Germans.- INTERNATIONAL PROTEST AGAINST INTERVENTION IN RUSSIA,The French and Italian organisations having invited British labour to declare a 24-hours strike as a protest against intervention in Russia, the Labour Executive replied that suoh a strike could only be carried put in England after a ballot cf the Trades Unions.    The extremists are now making strenuous efforts to bring out the workers on Monday next.THE KING&apos;3 VISIT  0 LEICESTER.   .The announcement that the status of a City has been conferred upon Leicester has caused immense satisfaction. The feeling of loyalty was always marked in this strong-hold of the Independent Labour Party, and it is now much enhanced,COVENTRY.&apos; -The improvement in feeling at&apos; Coventry,&apos; reported last-week, is maintained.A secret conference was held cn the l6th June. attended by less than 200,, delegates.    An &quot;announcement that they were to meet at the King1 s Weighjf House having appeared in the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, they were prepared to adjourn/
adjourn to another house if a hostile orowd had assembled; but as their soouts pronounced the ooast to bo olear they straggled into the meeting, evidently in some trepidation.    There were the usual resolutions for the formation of Soviets and for a General Strike on the 23rd June, but the spirit of the meeting was depressed.    McMANUS even went 00 far as to say that the Shop Stewards were a failure; and others expressed the view  hat the English worker oould be fooled for the next fi:fty years; the Government being too olever for tho agitators.msim mimsf paw.There appears to be some reason for the depression of the London Workers&apos; Committee, for the British Socialist Party, who held a meeting at Sheffield on the 11th June, oould only gather 30 people together and the meeting was broken up by the crowd.THE HERALD LEAGUE,,   H. SARA has conducted a week*a mission for theNorthern Division of the Herald League.   The audlenoesvaried from two hundred to three hundred.    SARA&apos;sBpeeohes had apparently two objeots1.

One of the out-standing matters for debate is the proposal that the industrial and politioal funotions of the offioiala shall be separated.Many-old ^members of the National Union of Railwaymenare/

PATON, of the Clyde Workers Committee,, addressing a meeting for the London University Sooialist Society, urged that Shop Stewards should devote themselves to the industrial rather than the politioal aspects of labour.SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.A branoh is about to be formed at Preston and it is expected that 2,000 members will be enrolled.Jftr correspondent reports that one of the main grievances of the disoharged men is that, as 75$ are unskilled, they are unable, owing to Trade Union oontrol and rule, to obtain employment in the principal industries.    Thoy el30 consider the Trade Unions in some measure responsible for unemployment, as, owing to thoir higft-handed aotion, employers will not launoh out.Some measure of unemployment among ex-soldiers is apparently due to the&apos;fact &quot;that they obtained discharge on false declarations of prospective employment.It is reported that the Comrades of the Great War and the National Federation of Disoharged &amp; Demobilised Sailors and SOfdiers will amalgamate with existing Trades Unions and that the whole will bo called the &quot;General Workers&apos; Union.&quot;The Coventry branch of the organisation is reported ..,to be very active; meetings are being held at whioh ... Trade Union officials preside,-and amalgamation Is        tfooneidered/
* -11KBONDDA SOCIALIST SOCIETY.   &apos; ::&apos;r: .L.T[James WINSTQNE spoke at Tonyrefail on June 8th. 1 About 400-500 present.    WINSTONE is Vioe-President of the south Wales&apos; Miners&apos; federation.    He emphasized the power whioh the workers oouid wield and urged; them to .,.ttfie, their, teftj.ns;-^ore.;.and. thair nwoles ^lasaV&apos;   The ..... nation ip on the, verge of bankruptcy and the capitalists want to get back out of tho, workers all the -millions , that the war has cost. ,  Tho, number of deaths amongst , miners was 36 per 5 million tons of poal during 1917. This sacrifice oould be greatly reduced under nationalisation.    The:reas,on for intervention in Russia is that English and Frenoh capitalists have their money invested there.    In his opinion, the Bolshevist0 would have succeeded in establishing a proper system of government in Russia if they had not been interfered with,v      A leading Bolshevik in.Denmark, who is now on hieway to Finland to work up a- revolution there, has stated , tha^ Tom MANN is ,in&apos;jr^&amp;^- of -$olshavik -moneyIt is significant that at a meeting pn tha 13th June in Kent,MANN strongly advocated that the. present Government should ,   bo replaced by a Soviet formed, by. workers.    In Russia v the Workers V Councils, were so auooossful that the BritishGovernment is wilfully issuing false report to the press , for the purpose of misleading the public respecting the ;   real conditions in Russia. -The influenoe of Tom MANN is said to be decliningbecause it is known that he never speaks except for money.&apos;   MISS SYLVIA PANKHURST/C&apos;     .;     considered possible,  ;,:
MISS SYLVIA PAMCHUR3T.Sylvia Pankhurot, in a telegram to Serrati, editor of &quot;Avanti&quot;, says that &apos;ftAMSAY MACDONALD is making anti-Soviet propaganda here^ supported intervention and favoured KERENSKY,&quot; and that he (Ramsay MACpOKALD) . is a bad adviser.TII.AK went to Cambridge on the 31st May and has- . addressed Indians and others there in a somewhat revolu-tionary vein.    Efforts.will apparently.be made to convert British undergroduatos to ,the Indian point of view, ...Both at Oxford and CambrJdgG there is, said to be a growing oliqne among the undergraduates of persons who profess a kind of academic Bolshevism.&quot;THE DAILY HERALD&quot;.For advertisement purposes the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; olaims a circulation of 170,000 a day;   this probably includes oopies distributed gratuitously as propaganda and copies disposed of under the trick well known to the advertising agent.    Ait any rato, the paying kind of advertisement is not forthdaaing. &apos;  One of my correspondents in the provinoes has notioed workmen who buy the paper, tear off and throw away the political,portion, ejid walk off with ;the sporting newsy which.is all that they appar to want. It appears from an intercepted telegram that the &quot;Daily Herald?, has beeh poying money -to. Philips PRICE, and ; r, there- a,$ow..evidence^n^e to show that HiillpB PRICE, together 1 with, an;4^0ri&apos;ceri;j;.Ro^8rt MINOR, have boasted.that, they  -.. were the author? of the seditious leaflets dropped by aeroplanes over the; Archangel front, and that they arealso/
also engaged in corrupting the- morale of the Armies of Occupation.    Robert MINOR was arrosted in Paris and may shortly, be put, on; his: trial before a Military Court in Cologne, in oompany with seven or eight German Spartaoisto arrested on the same ohargo.    It is possible that Philips PRICE may figure as defendant in the same trial., IRELAND.Nothing of a startling nature occurred during the past wook.    The Sinn Fein Executives have been active in the oountry distriots and trying to revive enthusiasm .  where it is somewhat lukewarm.   In Wexford their speakers wore severely heckled.    Advanoed Labour and Sinn Fein do not seem to be working altogether in sympathy and Labour wants to have the upper hand.    With this view they are trying to interest British Labour in Irish affairs by means of propaganda through the Irish Self-Determination League, the Labour News Servioe, articles by Irish Labour loaders in English papers, and tho issue of a publication by the Fabian Reooaroh Department on the present situation in Ireland.    This is to oost  800, whioh so far is not forthcoming.H. I3CLAND is said to have worked hio pasoage to Amerioa in order to gtiT up Amerioan opinion.    RYAN and BOLAND are to work in Amerioa and Walsh and Dunne in Paris.I hear from a very reliable souroe that an organised rebellion whioh is very muoh talked about is quite out of the question, and is only propaganda to influonoe the Government and the Peaoo Conference.    The Irish Volunteer Movement is very aotive and may make attempts at raids and at blowing up railways, as demonstrations to keep themin/
in good heart.Countess. MABKIE VTCZ&quot; host been,.sentenced&apos; to&apos;?aur&apos;x months11 imprisonment.8.H.T,
