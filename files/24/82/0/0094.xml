his Document is the Property of Hie Britannic iuaje sty^ s Gorernment) .War Cabinet.ret. It. 7594.&quot;Rent for Small Holdings established under the Land Settlement Scheme&quot;.Memo, by the President of the Board of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries.Political considerations are so largely involved in the point that I desire to refer to the Cabinet the question of the basis on which the rents for email holdings established under the Land Settlement scheme should be fixed.Under the Land Settlement (Facilities) Bill, the Government has recognised the impossibility, under present conditions, of charging rents sufficient to reOoup the capital outlay incurred in acquiring and equipping land for settlement.   The Bill therefore provides that the small holdings shall be let &quot;at the best price or sura that can reasonably be obtained&quot;.In the discussions on the Bill the principle indicated was that the new settlers could not be expected to pay an economic rent for their house, buildings and other equipment at present costs, and the current rate of interest, but that the rent of the land itself should be one corresponding vdth its capital value.Several County Councils, however, raise the question whether, oven as regards the land, the rents to be charged to the new settlers should be based upon present day values or whether tho new settlers should be charged rents on the same scale as those payable for the similar holdings in the same districts which were provided before the war either by private landowners or by County Councils.The difference between present-day and pre-war rents may amount to as much as 25/- an acre .Intense dissatisfaction rill undoubtedly be caused among ex-Sorvice men if the rents of their homings considerably exceed thos&apos; paid by civilian occupiers who were established in their holdings before the war.This difficulty has already arisen.   The County Council for the Isle of 31y have recently bought land for small holdings for which they propose to charge  4 an acre, which is a fair presont-day rent.   But this land is contiguous to other land purchased before the war, and let by the saire County Council ::n small holdings at 55/- an acre.   The Discharged Soldiers&apos; Federation are accordingly protesting that men who have fought in the war ought not to pay more than their next-door neighbours who obtained their holdings in time of peace.The right solution may be to raise the rents of all County Council small holdings to present-day level. But this revision would be an extremely difficult process.   County Councils
generally take the view that the rents of their pre-war email holdings should recoup the original outlay, and nothing more. They will also contend that small holders under the Act of 1908 were given to understand that their rents would not &quot;be raised, and that they were secure&apos; in their holdings so long as they farmed properly.   The existing small holders themselves would also vigorously object to any increase in their rents, and urge, in many cases justly, that the rents were raised on their improvements.County Councils can, and some do, raise rents where there is a change of tenancy.   But this process, even if made universal, would be too remote and gradual to remove the sense of grievance of the new settlers.On the other hand if the new small holdings are to be set up on an uneconomic basis as regards land as well as buildings and equipment, not only will the loss to the State be increased, but a wholly false position of land holding will be created.   A privileged class of small holders will exist; landowners will not be able to provide small holdings on the same terms, so that the whole burden for meeting the demand will fall upon the State, and this demand will continue after the 20 millions now assigned for the purpose has been expended.   All future small holdings will have to be provided by the State on terms which subsidise the small holder.   Nor can the process end there, the man who wants a small farm a little larger than the statutory limit of a small holding will equally claim to get it at a rent on the small holding level, and we shall enter on an unending cycle of false values.It may be possible to meet the grievance now by frank explanation - that the old settlers got their holdings on terms which have now become cheap, and got them with a virtual promise that their rents should not be raised during their lifetime, and that the new settlers even though their rents are higher, are receiving a considerable subsidy from the State in respect of their buildings, and are equally secure as long as they farm properly.   Sooner or later rents will have to correspond with capital values, but the difficulty of bringing them together will be greatly increased if a-large new series of uneconomic holdings are created.It is obvious that this question of rents may lead, to political agitation of a formidable character.   It is for this reason that I ask for a Cabinet decision.One of three alternatives may be adopted - either(l)   all rents of County Council small holdings may beraised to present-day level, and the new settlers charged present-day rents:   or(2) the rents of existing small holders may be left un-altered except on changes of tenancy, and the new settlers charged present-day rates:   or(3)   the rents of existing small holders may be left un-altered, and the new Bottlers charged rents on a pre-war basis.July 1st, 1919,ernie.
