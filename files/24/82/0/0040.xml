This.Document la the Property ofSHI %;. &apos; mmentThe Judicial Committee of the Privy Councilreported last July on the., issues raised by certain Resolutions of the Legislative Council of Southern Rhodesia respecting the ownership of the unalienated lands in the territory.    The matter came before them by &quot;Special Refex*encea, but it was agreed that as full of feet would be given to their findings as i% it came to them in their judicial capacity by way of appeal from a decision of a lower Court.South Africa Company is not the owner of the lands; that &quot;it is entitled to dispose of the unalienated lands in due course of administration, and to apply the moneys or revenues derived therefrom in duly reimbursing all proper outlays on administrative account in the current jar in past years, and, if its administration of Southern Rhodesia should be determined by the Crown, then the right to look to the Crown to secure to it (either out of the proceeds of further sales of the lands by whomsoever made, or, if the Crown should grant away these lands or proceeds to others, from public funds), the due reimbursement of any outstanding balance of aggregated advances made by it for necessary and proper expenditure upon the administra-tion of Southern Rhodesia.0give an authoritative statement of the view which is taken by His Majesty&apos;a Government as to the nature and extent of the obligation under which, by this decision,The Committee have decided that the BritishFrom various quarters I am being pressed totho
the Crown lies.It is obviously necessary to settle the amount of the accumulated deficits for which the Company will be entitled to reimbursement.    I am at present engaged in setting up the Commission,for which provision is mads in the current estimates, whose duty it will be to determine this amount.    It will be composed of members as to whose standing and impartiality there can be no question., and I propose to arrange with the Company when agreeing to the terms of reference, that the decision of the Commission shall be binding on all parties.The question on which I desire to have the view of the Cabinet is this:   at what date should His Majesty;s Government regard the sum so determined as becoming due and payable to the Company ?    It clearly &quot;will not become payable so long as the Company continues to administer the territory *   If by a change in the constitutional status of Southern Rhodesia and the consequent determination of the Charter the Company loses its administrative powers, it is wholly unlikely that &quot;the Crown&quot; would cease to be technically the owner of the lands;   and it might therefore be argued that the decision of the Judicial Committee would be sufficiently met if thereafter the receipts of the land sales were made over to i^he Company as they accrued, and that no question of a lump sum need arise until the last acre had been sold and an adverse balance still remained for liquidation.Such a position migbt be taken by a private individual - and conceivably with success - but I regard it as too inequitable for His Majesty&apos;s Government toadopt.
adopt,    I greatly doubt if the total value of the lands would bo sufficient to moot the Company&apos;s claim: they can obviously only be sold gradually over a term of years and as meanwhile interest would be accruing on any sum due to the Company over, and above what had been realised by the sale of lands, the total might never be liquidated and indeed might go on indofinitely increasing,A clear decision of the Government on the point, which can be announced for the guidance of all parties interested., is vory necessary.
