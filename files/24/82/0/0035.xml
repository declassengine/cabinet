June the loth had, in faot, been appointed for a rising, but it failed because the Soviet Committee refused to join it.    The leader was arrested on Saturday and on Sunday there was a riot before the prison, led by Hungarians, whioh resulted in twenty being killed and a hundred wounded.   The prisoners were then released.    It is reported this morning that the Communist Government in Hungary has notified the Czeohs that they will discontinue hostilities.   Their successes over the Czeohs have certainly strengthened their position temporarily, though the feeling against them in Hungary itself appears to be gathering strength,The fall of Petrograd appears to be imminent. Koltohak has recovered from his reverse and Donikin&apos;s Army is pushing forward.In Canada the situation is beginning to olear up; the leaders in Winnipeg have been arrested and the foroes of law and order are likely to prevail.There are warnings of a growing restlessness among the Negroes not only in tho United States but seorotly in the West Indies,Evidenoe is accumulating that in plaoes as remote as tho Argentine there has been direot communication with Lenin.    In Hungary the Communist movement was direoted by him almost daily, and there is now evidenoe that oertain Spartaoists who have been attempting to oorrupt the morals of the Armies of Oooupation have reoeived their instructions from Mosoow.
france the return to normal conditions in Paris and the news that three fifths of the miners are still working on the eve of the presentation to Germany of the Allies&apos; final terms prove the strike movement to have been due to eoonomio causes, and not, as the Extremists endeavoured to represent, to inoipient Bolshevism.The attitude of the Paris Garrison has been throughout unsympathetic to the strikers.    On the other hand, troops recently returned from Russia appear to have been much impressed by the faot that the Bolsheviks allowed their withdrawal from Odessa without aggression, and to be opposed to further intervention in Russian affairs by the Allies.BELGIUM ( &apos; 1The mainstay of socialism in Bslgium Is the Co-operative movement, whioh has developed politically on the same lines as the British Trades Unions and whioh is now very powerful.    The avowed aim of the Sooialists is to establish a-Co-operative Store and a Maison de Peuple in each Commune, of Belgium;    The prevailing high prioes have resulted in.an increasing number of Co-operative Sooieties in the Lioge distriot. . Except at Antwerp, however, eoonomio dondrtions show steady improvement;   and it is estimated that a quarter of the devastated area will be under -  cultivation before August.The average wage paid or claimed at the present time, including- the bonus for the high cost of living, appears to be between 8 and 13 franos a day.SWITZBRLAND    &apos;The visit recently paid at Fribourg by Longuet and Ramsay Maodonald to Herr Solf, the German Vioe Chancellor and Ex-Minister for the Colonies, is probably oonneotedwith/

with the Socialist conventions recently hold at Rome, Milan and Berne, whose, object is said to be the organisation of pro-German movements in all Allied and neutral countries to secure modification of the peace  terms in favour of Germany.

According to a French report several deputies of the National Swiss Council intend Officially to protest against what they describe as the Imperialistic Treaty of Versailles.

At a Congress of the various Swiss Communist groups recently held at Bienne it was decided to create a Swiss Communist Party with headquarters at Zurich.

The Swiss authorities take a serious view of a Bolshevik plot to smaggle arms and ammunition into Switzerland for revolutionary purposes.

German propagenda in Switzerland includes the circulation of a pamphlet entitled "German Colonial Methods", which advertises the administration of the German Colonies and the good business facilities there afforded.

GERMANY.

The general opinion in Germany is that the Scheidemann Government must fall, whatever the result of the Peace Congress. Noake, meanwhile, recently offended his military policy at a sitting of the Socialist Party Congress and accused the Independents of as attempt to secure the support of the volunteer army in case of the overthrow of the present ministry.

In this connection it is Worth noting that the old military party are taking advantage of the Situation to agitate for the defence of the Eastern frontier against the Poles, while the Phineland Separatist Movement is being used to increase the flood of National fooling throughout Germany. 

RANTZA? appears new to favour a Russo-German-Japanese alliance rather than one with Bolshevik Russia.

The German Government/
&apos;    -   147(Foreign) * - 3 - .. , .Government,- however, -continues to -aid. the-Sovietv0overnment v   by indirect means suoh as lending a number of German officers to the Bolshevik forces.There is no improvement in the situation in Austria.The Austrian Government professes to see no prospect of avoiding overthrow by the Bolsheviks, in view of the eoonomio , terms of the Peaoe Treaty, and they urge that in that event the Czechs must shore the same fate.An outbreak of national Chauvinism and an inoreased tendenoy to effect a union&apos; with Germany has been the result of the publication of the Peaoe Terms.The iron works in btyria are rapidly being foroed to deorease their output in iron for laok of coal and there are threats to stop work in the future unless coal is forthcoming very shortly.    Two million workmen would be affected in this event,Sooialist officers of the Volkswehr and officers of the War Office in Vienna are on strike for more pay.    Most of them are reported to be wearing the Sooialist red button,On the 5th June the irehoh Mission at Vienna demanded the oession of Arms to the Czechs.    Deutsch, Minister for War, agreed to their demand, but stated that he was powerless so . . long as the strike at the War Offioe oontinued.The Chief of Polioe regards the situation as very grave. The mass of the people will not oppose the Bolsheviks, who had fixed upon June l6th for their rising.    They had their troopE and arms all ready for seizing the Government buildings.Violent encounters continue between! the Hungarian and Czecho-Slovak forces, notwithstanding Bela Kun&apos;s undertaking for a mutual suspension of hostilities with the Czeoho-Slovaks/

()-&quot;&apos; &apos;&apos;-    &apos; iif-. i    .. .&apos;At a Soviet Congress held on the 12th June, Be la Kun deolared that &quot;they were strong enough to spread-Internationalism not only Eastward but Westward.    The proletariats of German-Austria and Hungary would soon present a united front to the Entente&quot;.    As to the representations of the Allies calling upon them to oease their attaoks on the Czeoho-Slovaks, the meeting enthusiastically deoided to continue the advanoe.    This is a remarkable change from the &quot;state of mind of Bela Kun a month ago, when he was telling Lenin that they were in a most desperate position, and that If no armed help oould be given from Galidia, destruction awaited them,.    On the othe: hand, a wireless message of yesterday reports-that Be la Kun has notified Monsieur Masaryk that he:has forbidden the Hungarian Army to take any aggressive aotion.,It is curious to note that throughout April and May th Hungarian Communists appear to have been aoting under the direot orders of Leninwhose-policy is to confisoate the large estates but to leave the land of middle*-olaos peasanti and email-holders&apos; untbuohed.   in - fact, the Marxian Communism is being very much &quot;watered down- to meet the difficulties of the &quot;situation. -&quot;     &apos;     ,u\Information froma;Hungarian.refugee oonfirms the report that Italian oftlosra have prooured:arms and ammunition, inoludihg machine guns, from the Vienna Arsenal and are selling these to the Hungarian Communists.Karoyli&apos;s Government situated at Szogdin, has sent, through the French Military Mission and the French Legation at Vienna, a note.the Peaoo Conferenoa protesting -against :*hs summoning of the Soviet Government to Pari3.
(Foreign) .  -5&apos; - :&apos;mm- ,,    The..attempt at bringing about a general strike has failed.    The labour unrest is mainly due to the high cost of living, whioh the Government is unable to control.There ia evidenoe that the Right Wing of the Sooiallst Party is now gaining ground at the expense of the extreme Left.   The Socialist groups are organised, but they have not a conspicuous leader.,A combination is said to have been formed among important employers to resist Bolshevism, and there is a talk of enlisting the servioes of the &quot;Arditi&quot; (Storm Troop if neoessary.A wireless message from Buda pesth reports that the Croatians of the Flume region are agitating for a separate Republic. , The new Republic would stretoh from Buocari to Adelsberg with Fiume as its capital, and would be administered by a Directorate of five - two Italians, one Jugo-Slay, one native of Plume and one Magyar.Aooording to an intercepted letter, dated 25th May, cis, the Bolshevik Sdmundo Peluso was then in Berlin.According to news from HelsingforSr-Kronstadt is in :   - flames and seven Bolshevik warships.have.hoisted the white &quot;&quot; lag and surrendered to the British. Fleet.    The oapture of the fortress of Krasnaya Gorka on tho mainland opposite Kronstadt has opened the road to Peterhof and Petrograd. Meanwhile, the Bolsheviks are evaouating from Petrograd all persons upon whom they cannot depend, and the bourgeoisie have been warned that if the oity is taken none of them will be left to decorate it in honour of the oounter-revolutionaries.Admiral Koltohak appears to have recovered from hisreoent/
reoent defeat at Ufa, and on the Southern flank, *6o miles Wast of Orenburg, the Ural Cossacks olaim to have taken 20,000 prisoners .    There have also been some Allied suooesses on the Murmansk front.The advance of General Denikih continues, and his Eastern wing is now 80 miles South of Tsaritsen.    There are daily skirmishes on the Finnish frontier.It is reported that about 3,700 German and 12,000 Austrian N .0.0&apos;s: and men are serving in the Russian Red Army They desert readily when they think there is a &apos;chance of getting home.   .      ,.vMany Bolshevist agitators are endeavouring to enter Koltohak^s Army disguised as prisoners of war returning from Germany, and the Soviet Government is oarrying on a very active propaganda at the front by moans of leaflets, cinematographs and portable theatres,    Bolshevik wireless is also circulating false rumours to the effect that Koltohji intends to vaoate his position in favour of the Grand Duke Michael, the brother of the Tsar&apos;.A Russian reactionary group has been formed in Switzerland with headquarters at Lausanne and branches in Paris and London.    Its members, who have large funds at their disposal,, are working for the restoration of Tsarism. &apos; &apos; &quot;&apos;The Commissary of Agriculture in Soviet &quot;Russia has beer, ordered to plaoe all large estates under the management of so-oalled specialists.    These latter are none other than &quot; &apos;  the former landowners.    The Sooialist paper announcing &apos;-&apos; these reforms adds that the compromise with the hatedbourgeoisie is a violation of the- fundamental principles of communism, proving the powerlessnesa of Bolshevism and its imminent downfall.An informant who has reoently travelled-in many parts
v of Russia is of? opinion&apos; thatsreligious feeling is. still very strong,    Although the priests have becn-perseoutecl they still perform their usual duties of burying the dead, eto.He describes the situation in the   Cauoasus as being very unsatisfactory.;    The Italian troops who have, just taken over from the British are&apos;most unpopular, and it is probable that the. Bolshevist elements will,/take advantage of this faot &quot;to oreato trouble..As regards the.British oooupatlon of,Baku, the lack of a definite British polioy towards Russia is:strongly felt&apos;by the inhabitants.    Our troops are discontented and anxious to get home... -Food prices are very high and there is considerable unemployment as export of oil up the Volga has been stopped.: The Bolshevik&apos; Finance Bureau shows a revenue of twenty thousand million roubles for- the first six months of this year, and an expenditure of fifty thousand million roubles.    The deficit is being covered by the emission of hank notes. h^&quot;&quot;fee^Ameriban Bolshevist papers &quot;Novy Mir&quot; and &quot;New York Call&quot; h^ve reoently published articles dealing with alleged British atrocities, which are supposed.to have taken place in the Cis-Caspian Province.   ,The informant is named&apos;^^Y^sily-Bhernoff^ a. sailor of tho s.s. &quot;iKraifciin*&apos; -who*o&apos;foaii^&apos;ii-&apos;-the&quot;&apos;information from a wireless message from the Russian&apos;1 Soviet Government,, received by his ship on.April 20th: , In the message it is alleged that. 26 Bolshevik Commissaries-who were on their way to. India as frris oners 4(ere taken &apos;out of the train and shot by order of the British Military Authorities.    A. request/
^For^dLgnJ&quot; - 8 -request- for an in-ve^rtij^^    by a joint JEnglisn-ftusslan  J Committee is said to.have been-retfueed- by the Brit ish Government. . ,     *, * r ;.On the Olonotz front the Whites, under pressure ofsuperior numbers of Bolsheviks, are retreating along the [-whole front and may probably be driven baok to the front there is reason to suspect that in this oase the local Reg will attempt to oreate a revolt.Although aooording to the Armistice terms all Germani were to leave Finland, a great many still remain disguise! as civilians.German influence is still strong and Germany has undoubtedly enlisted a huge.number of Finnish and Russian pro-German agents who keep.her well informed as to the situation in Finland.General Udenitoh is forming an organisation for administering Petrograd and the distriots liberated from I; the Bolshevik rule.    He will himself be President.According to the Amerioans, there is a seoret agreement between the Socialists and.tho Agrarians to drop Mannerhsim after the adoption of the constitution.    The Sooialist leaders are intriguing to compel the Finnish Government to break off relations with the reactionary Russian oiroles.POLAND.Outwardly the oountry is quiet, but there is great  1 anxiety about the German menace.    Many people daily expel a German attack, and precautionary measures are being taken.W i
(Foreign) - 9 -In Silesia agents are at work stirring up pro-German fooling among the purely Polish Communities.    Sohool teaohers are active in spreading propaganda among their pupils, but the strongest prossure of all is exerted by the Catholic Clergy who are preaching in favour of Germany and threatening the women parishioners with refusal of confession and&quot;absolution in case they should vote a plebiscite for union with Poland.    This is-&apos; \; believed to be due to Erzberger who has made a bargain with the Vatican that he will oppose the separation of Church and State in the Catholio portions of Germany,NORWAY : -The decision taken1 at&apos;a recent,National Congress of - the Norwegian Socialist Party in favour of an allianoe with the Third International at Moscow,&apos;and which included the establishment of a Soviet system in a yearns time, may p03sibly cause a party split, for the moderate Socialists were absent from the meeting, and two thirds of the Socialist Deputies are protesting against the Bolshevik polioy of the Party.BALTIC PROVINCES.In Courland the Germans have established a military dictatorship and have suppressed all. Lettish local administration, while what remains, of the Lettish Army is doomed to disappear.    The keynote of German ideas, is that Courland is a land for colonisation and peasants from alsace-who have been dispossessed by the Prenoh have entered the Bait Landwehr aB a preliminary to getting land.    Livenia and&apos;Es&apos;thonia are similarly menaced,    The Bait Lahdwehr, which is largely composed-of German soldiers, has received orders to clear Livonia of Bolshevists,    Thedanger/
(Foreign) &quot;&apos;       &apos; - 10 -danger of the situation is inoreaaed by the faot that th is undoubtedly an understanding between the Germans and the.Bolshevista.   Two Gorman officers have  been sont to Reval to agitate with a view ,to producing there a situation similar to that,existing in Courland and to prepare the way for German Baltio Hegemony.A seoret German document has been obtained whioh confirms the above German policy and givos details of a pro-German propaganda organisation.The Bolsheviks in Holland are reported to be very short of funds and Wynkoop has instructed all Russian Bolshevist&apos;agents to leave for Russia and Berlin, as he considers that their activities are having no effeot on the population.Extensive propaganda against Bolshevism has been started by the Dutch Authorities.  -3trikes still occur from time to time, but are oarried on in a more constitutional manner than heretofore. .; .The Dutch Army is- said to be wholly unaffeoted by Bolshevist propa^enda .&apos; -The unpopularity of the Jews appears to be growing:- they are held responsible, for all the Bolshevik.activitie&apos;B.! .      . &apos;3FAIN.In-spite of theW great efforts to secure&quot; votes, the Royalists have had a severe set-baok in the reoent ElectIons-In Barcelona, where the Regionalists (Home Rulors for the province) seoured an. overwhelming majority.  The Regionalists inolude many Royalists of the type that put the welfare of their province before that of their country.    The Workers1 Syndioate had ordered/
(Foreign)11ordered its members not to vote, and the majority obeyed. If they had put up their own members, four or five would have been eleoted.Barcelona is still under martial law, although there is no outward show of aimed foroe and everything is quiet.There was satisfaction and some surprise at the Election results in Madrid, where the Republicans triumphed.PORTUGAL.Bolshevism has steadily lost ground sinoe the failure of the advertised movement for foay 1st.    Itsoontinued existence is dependent only on high prioes and profiteering.A general strike was decided upon at a meeting held yesterday.    The Government has taken precautions.TURKEY.The Bolsheviks are making every effort to excite Pan-Islamic opinion in Central Asia.    In addition to the usual propaganda they are offering amnesty to anti-Bo the vik Mussulmans.Active and strongly Bolshevist branches of the Young Turk Party are said to exist in Switzerland, while similar organisations are to be established at Amsterdam, Copenhagen&quot;and in America.:    The Party is also associated with certain elements of the Persian Revolutionary Group and with a seoret sooiety called.the &quot;Madielarab&quot;, whose object is reported to be the massaoro of(Armenians in Syria. &apos; :EGYPT.Externally all is quiet.    The extremists and students continue to oirculo.be seditious propaganda, but their efforts to bring about a general strike and to oreate disturbances have been unsuccessful.   Having failed to upset/
upset the new Ministry by oaluumy, they are now talking ofarson.    They do not at all want Lord Milner&apos;s Commission ,to oome out and are working hard against it.    They talk of a throe days1 general strike as an Egyptian greeting to tho Commission.An intercepted letter shows that the peasants are beginning to see through the agitators, and the voioes of the older men, who knew oppression under the Turkish regime and can compare it with their present state of : peaoe and affluonoo, are beginning to be heard.The strike oh the Suez Canal, whioh has lasted for four weeks, is now over.    The strikers have gone baok with the concessions whioh were offered to them before the strike.    Traffic has never been interrupted.There is now confirmation of my former report that the medium of communication between Egypt and the Egyptian Committee in Switzerland is certain Italian offioials.A very anti-British artiole appeared in MLa Sentinelle&apos;] of, l6th May, dealing with alleged atrooities by British troops during the reoent disturbances in Egypt,INDIA.The Indian Congress Delegates here do not expeot the Indian Reforms Bill to bo oarried through exoept possibly in a modified form.Tilak^a party and the extremists believe that the moderate element has been brought over by the Government and at Government expense, to oounter-balanoe their own opinions.There is reason to believe that Tilak himself would woloome strong ooeroive measures by the Government as he would thon have a much stronger ground for appealing to indians/
&quot;Indians for extreme resistance.    He visited Cambridge at the end of last month and spoke at an Indian Students&apos; meeting on the &quot;Condition of India&quot;.,   His speeoh was oouohed in simple language, but there was an undercurrent of suggestion to undergraduates that they might have to resort to violence.    His references to the Bowlatt Bills wore bitter, and he concluded his speeoh with an impassioned appeal to the students to suffer for their countryrs oause if need be.Mrs. Annie Besant, accompanied by John Sourr of the staff of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, Featonji Wadia and K.R. Tilang arrived at Plymouth on the 6th June.Nuri Sayyed Pasha and other Arab leaders in Syria are leaving for Mesopotamia to inaugurate a pan-Arab campaign.In agreement with the Bolsheviks, Muhammad Aslam Khan has been appointed by the Afghans Consul-general   at Tashkend.&apos;The Tashkerid wireless reports that Batavih and Bravine arejieading a Bolshevik Mission, which was to leave for Kabul and thence on to India about the middle of the month.Wall Muhammad^ Mission was to leave for Moscow from Tashkend about the same time.CANADA.The deoision of the Winnipeg Railwaymen to stand by their written agreements constitutes a serious set back to the Bolshevist oause in Canada: &apos; the strikers are faoed with lack of funds, for help from outside unions is undoubtedly slackening.    Martens of New York is doing what he can for the cause by financing a new Bolshevik newspaper,called Novy Vek,   (New Bra), whioh is to be published immediately in Winnipeg.Great/
Oroefci irritation is felt-ln^Vanoouver at the dislocation of industrjroaused by the general strike.       ) Although the employees of the Toronto Street Railway have decided to postpone their strike for a week, they refuse to recognise the Board of Conciliation.    20,000 strikers are out In Montreal, but the unions refuse any connection with the Winnipeg strike.The information that Ludwig Martens, the leader of the Bolshevik faction, had registered himself here as a German, was very useful.  On receipt of a oable message, the United States Government arrested nartens. and his case is now under investigation.The recent bomb outrages are now believed to be the work of an almost negligible group of terrorists.A dangerous form of anti-Bolshevik propaganda was suggested by the Amerioan &quot;Moving Pioture world&quot; as a means of advertising afila called &quot;Bolshevism on Trial&quot;. Bed PlagB were to be put up in the town, and soldiers hired to pull them down,   The Management would then have produoed flaming handbills explaining that the film was not an argument for anarchy.    The object was, of oourse, merely to enhance the profits.The United Labour Educational Committee cf New York ia founding a Workmen&apos;s Theatre which is to open on August 10tji( Prom the names of the promoters it seems clear that it is to be used for both Bolshevik and German propaganda. Unfortunately, American firms put the question of profit foremost, for it appears that no less than 742 more or less important (firms have offered to do business with the Soviet Bureau..      ifSti     . The/
(Foreign) -15-The omission of any referenoe to Amerioan prowess in Field Marshal&apos;Haig&apos;s report is said to have occasioned a deep feeling of resentment in tho Amerioan Army, both in Franse and the United States.Conversations with middle-olass Germans in New York show that the German Colony is quite unrepentant and hopes for a war of revenge.    Its prinoipal hostility is directed against Great Britain, Proposed Legislation.I have now received oopies of the Draft Bills whioh are pending in Congress,(A) prohibits immigration for a period of not less than four, years.(B) is a Bill &apos;to punish aots of interference&apos; with ;,, the foreign relations of the United States, to puniBhespionage, and better to enforce tho Criminal Laws of the United States.(C) is a war measure, providing heavy penalties for the members of unlawful Associations while the united States are engaged in war, and is therefore merely a temporary;measure,   It is thought likely that these measures may be passed without material alterationThe Negro Question.Burghardt Du Bois is.;ve.ry aotive, and appears to be gaining in popularity, though his rivals, continue&apos; to cover him with abuse.W. Monroe Trotter is still in Paris, and is likely to return at the same time as the President.-John D. Boyde, of 108, West 138th Street, New York, is publishing a ooloured magazine entitled &quot;0ur3oys and Girls&quot;, and is also agent for the &quot;african Telegraph&quot; of London,    He has stated publioly that the negro agitatorBhere/

The negroes are indignant that the American Legion, a politioal organisation formed among the returned soldiers, has refused to admit men of colour.   There is also muoh disoussion about the position of negroes in organised Labour,THE WEST INDIES.The Caribbean League, which is a sort of seoret sooiety among negroes1, is reported now to bo whispering about a negro rising:to begin, in Jamaica and to spread towards the Islands, the polloy being the old one of falling suddenly upon the Whites and murdering them.    The looal authorities in each Island ought to. watch the      * proceedings of this Sooioty very oarefully.SOUTH AMERICA (Argentine)A reliable report oonfirms the fact that the Bolshevist Headquarters in Buenos Ayreaare in direct eommunioation with Moscow,In the Argentina Republic there are said to be at present about&apos;3,5O0 Maximilists and Bolshevists, the ....majority of whom live in the vicinity of Buenos Ayres/ Only about 50, however, are actively engaged in spreading propaganda for whioh purpose they are provided with ... abundant funds. &apos;
