The Army Council have had under consideration the question of the ultimatedisposal of the large funds which have accumulated as a result of canteen trading_1during the war, and which it is estimated when liquidation is complete will amount to  Qen some 10,536,0007. 22492. The funds arise from the following sources : (i.) Central Regimental Institutes Fund.  This is made up from the 2 per cent of the gross takingsof canteens at home, which the Navy and ArmyCanteen Board (who administer these canteens) are under agreement to pay into a Central Fund for thebenefit of the Army. On 31st March the unexpended balance amounted to  ...       636,000(ii.) Navy and Army Canteen Board Profits.These profits, accruing from canteen trading at home,amounted on 31st December, 1918, to......      ...     1,900,000(iii.) Expeditionary Force Canteen Profits.This organization went into liquidation on 30th April,1919, and its ultimate profits are roughly estimated at    8,000,000Total      -.........   10,536,0003. Of this total sum a proportion represents profits from purchases by Dominion, Colonial and Indian troops ; when these have been ascertained and deducted the amount then available in respect of Imperial troops may be roughly estimated at 8,000,000/. At the present time the greater part of these profits are locked up in trading capital, some of which may have to be used for future nanteen trading, but the Expeditionary Force Canteens have been liquidated to the extent of 2,000,000/., which is now held in securities and there is also immediately available the 636,000/. belonging to the Central Regimental Institutes Fund.4. The policy of the Council has been to conserve canteen and similar funds with a view to utilising them after the war in the best interests of those who are serving or have served and their dependants.With this policy in view it was decided in December, 1918, to form a League representing the three services which would organize the distribution of the funds in-question for the benefit of serving and ex-serving men, and which might co-ordinate the work of the many societies and associations which already exist for the benefit of service and ex-service men-and their dependants. This decision was promulgated in an A Army Council Instruction. -  y,Besides the distribution of such funds, it was contemplated that the League would have as one of its main objects the establishment of a spirit of comradeship and mutual help among all who have served or are serving in His Majesty&apos;s Forces.5. In view of the fact that the large majority of men, who contributed as soldiers and sailors to the profits of canteens, are now civilians, and that widows and children are to share in the benefits from canteen profits, the Army Council consider that the administration of such funds should not rest with the War Office so fai1 as they are concerned, but should be transferred to a central authority representative of all the interests concerned.6. In preparing the details of such a scheme, the Council have felt it desirable to recommend that the title of the new organization should not be &quot; The Empire Services League &quot; as originally contemplated, but &quot; The United Services Fund &quot; (not requiring(B19/289)  10  7/19  h&amp;s  7239wo
membership as intended in the case of the &quot; League &quot;), with the subheading &quot; For the benefit of the ex-serving and serving officers and men and their dependants.&quot; This new designation will do away with any suspicion that the funds are to be used for any other than purely philanthropic or benefit purposes..7. While provision has been made in the draft scheme (given in Appendix &quot; A&quot;) for participation by the Admiralty and Air Ministry should these departments wish to take advantage of it, the scheme is put forward by the Army Council from their point of view and it will be understood that only that proportion of canteen profits resulting from military canteens will be devoted to military interests.The proportions of the total profits as between the Navy, Army and Air Force have not yet been worked out, but the acceptance or non-acceptance of the scheme by the Admiralty and Air Ministry, though it may require modification in the proposed title of the fund and in the composition of the Central Council, does not affect in principle the conception of the scheme, which can be limited in its application to the sphere of military interests and which commends itself to the Army Council as furnishing the best arrangements for distributing the Army&apos;s share of canteen profits and safeguarding the interests for which they are responsible.8. Regard being had to the very wide interests involved, both civil and military, the scheme given in Appendix &quot; A &quot; is submitted for the approval of the Cabinet, in order that it may be supported by the weight of national and not merely departmental sanction.W. S. CHURCHILL.1st July, 1919.
