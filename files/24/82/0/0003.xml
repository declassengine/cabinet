Military Secret.919mil June 1.919. (Received 18th.)0^^^201. 17th June. Afghanistan. Reference to your telegram of the loth instant, 2372, Amir&apos;s reply of Jltli June, regarding which we have addressed you separately in a Foreign and Political Department telegram, would appear 1o corroborate the theory that the Amir is prompted by sincere desire for peace. There appears to us little of anything in his actions inconsistent with this theory, it is true that he does not make any great concessions, but this is due partly to his desire to save his face with his own people and retain his influence with the tribes in case peace negotiations break down and partly to the fact that he has not yet been brought to his knees. We seem to have definite evidence of his sincerity in prompt and effective manner in which his orders to the Commanders of the Afghan troops to suspend hostilities have, on the whole, been carried out. We do not know if he has yet ordered that the tribes should be instructed to cease aggressive action. Reports are contradictory in this respect, and there is no doubt that the Mullahs and agents were continuing anti-British propaganda until a few days ago. At the same time we have throughout continued our preparations on the chance of the Amir&apos;s action being merely a ruse to gain-time. There is no question that Amir and his advisers have been markedly influenced by Bolshevik propaganda. But there is nothing definite to show that Amir received any promise of Bolshevik support before embarking on his aggressive action. Whether he has received such promise since seems doubtful, but Tashkent! wireless makes it clear Bolsheviks are making strenuous efforts to goad Afghanistan on. We have no knowledge of any material assistance rendered so far by Bolsheviks, and hearing in mind that their first endeavour is to open a road to the Caspian Sea, we do not think that they have men and transport to detach to Afghanistan.
