This Document is the PropertyJune, 1919. 1 His Britannic MajC3tv&apos;s Gr. . :r;i^, :.Admiralty Memorandum for the War Cabinet.The estimate of the financial provision required for the Navy during the present year 1919-20, which was outlined in the Yftiite Paper issued in connection with the Vote on Accoun last April and will be presented to Parliament, revised and in fuller detail, in the Navy Estimates in&apos;July, - has been framed not only with reference to certain definite commitments well-known to the Cabinet, but also on the understanding thattuncer.^------      --------- .   . ...strong Fleet in a state of readiness for action.,2.-     The statement in Appendix I gives a summary of the composition of this Fleet, its distribution over the world, and the degree of readiness in which the ships will he maintained, i.e., whether with full crews, reduced crews, or reserve crews.    The full details are contained in the attached print entitled &quot;Post-war Fleet, Edition Wo. 5&quot;.3.-     The object of the present Memorandum is in the first place to obtain specific approval for the policy v/hich is being adopted duT&apos;ihg&quot;&quot;the^pfesent year, in view &quot;or &quot;the&quot;tactthat it will be necessary to answer questions on the subject when the Navy Estimates come under discussion in the House of Commons, and in the second place to give an indication of the views of the Board of Admiralty on the reductions that may be possible in 1920-21, independently of aiw/agreement for a drastic reduction of naval armaments, finternational4.-     In arriving at the composition and distribution of the Fleet shown in Appendix I, it was fully recognised by my naval advisers that they were providing for a purely trans irt-ional period.    The situation since the Armistice has been so uncertain and variable that it has been impossible to adopt any definite naval policy except that of remaining ready for any emergency.. 5.-     The strength of the fleet, when the older vessels now relegated to the sale list have been eliminated, will be, apart from submarines, small craft, tenders, auxiliaries and ships building, and not including ships of the Royal Austrian Navy &apos;:-Battleships.  &apos; Battle Cruisers.

7*-&apos;    It will be observed from the Statement in Appendix I. that in the disposition of this force to1 meet the immediate situation it is proposed to concentrate the capital shins in European Waters.   To avoid misconception it should be stated at once that this concentration is not&apos; based on any needs of the strategical or international situation as-these exist today, but on grounds of convenience and economy.    The arrangement ooviates difficulties of docking and repairs, and ff circumstances require it the ships can be sent to any threatened or desired area with greater ease than would be the case if they had to be trans-ferred from one foreign station to another*8.-     On the other hand the considerations applying to the disposition of the Light Cruisers differ widely from those affecting the capital&quot;ships *   It is necessary that a large proportion of these cruisers should be -on foreign stations.   Out of a total of 33 with full crews it is proposed that only 7 be stationed in Home Waters, 6 in the Mediterranean and the rdmainder on other foreign stationso    Those numbers cannot, it is considered, be materially reduced^   The importance of showing the flag and maintaining British prestige abroad and policing the outlying parts of the world is greater now than ever; and the great distances between ports on foreign stations and the widely separated islands and territories of the Empire make demands on our cruiser squadrons which necessitate their being of an adequate strength *9c-     To man this fleet with its appropriate shore sstab-lishments, etc entails a total active&quot; naval personnel of about 151,300$ and a reduction of this number to any considerable extent could only have been obtained by one or other of two alternativesocrews being a minimum required maintenanceo(b) The relegation of some of the ships with full or reduced crews to a lower categoryo. 10With regard to the first alternative, the complements of ships with full crews are, although slightly reduced from war-complements, established at a figure which enables them to be instantly ready for any service; and any reduction in this number for ships liable to service in emergencies and especially those ships on foreign stations, would be unwise and dangerous. In the case of  hose ships in commission with reduced crews a reduction is also not recommended, for experience shows that the complements provided for are the minimum necessary to ensuremobility and efficiency.11Developments during the war have resulted in additional apparatus requiring skilled and constant attention being installed in all ships and it is more probable that the reduced crews may have to be slightly increased.12c-     A reduction of the complements of ships with full or reduced crews would, in short&quot;, affect seriously the efficiency of these ships, and is therefore not recommended.Note. -0 - The vote for 1919-20 is 157,821 exclusive of any requirement for Naval Air Force, but this includes about 6,500 surplus Seamen, Marines and others, not actually required By the Post War Fleet, but which must be voted so long as they exist.
B8tf 4913 -     The question of the second alternative, the relegation of ships with full or reduced crews to a lower category, leads me from the first to the second part of my select, namely, the reductions that should he possible m the lleet in 1920-1&amp;21, independently of the situation4that would be created by any general agreement for the reduction of naval armaments -14e-     After the signature of the various Peace Treaties, and especially that with Germany, it is anticipated that the present indefinite situation will become clearer and the broad lines of future naval policy may then be laid down with an assurance that is impossible as yet,15.-     One at any rate of the existing commitments of the Navy, viz., the duty of safeguarding the German snips interned ta at Scapa Flow and of ensuring that the naval terms of the Armistice&quot;with regard to the remaining ships are carried out, -will lapse shortly after the signature of peaceu16o-     A definite end to the commitments entailing the employment of a considerable number of ships and personnel in North Russia, the Baltic, the Black Sea and the Near last cannot be so easily foreseen, but it may be hoped that by 1920 it will be possible to reduce them substantially.17,-     On the other hand, the future naval intentions of certain other powers, which at the present time fire not clear, must necessarily continue to affect our Naval policy.18.-     It is probable also that the state of unrest in the Moslem World may necessitate the employment of additional ships in the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf to suppress guiH running and generally to uphold British interests and prestige.19.-     Taking the outlook as a whole, however, we have every reason to hope that the situation, so far as the navy is con-cerned will have greatly cleared by next year and will justify a reduction of the Plee&apos;t which is to be maintained during the present year.    The matter has been very carefully considered by the Board of Admiralty, and the following conclusions have been arrived at.    These conclusions, as already stated, do not take into account the effects of any possible international agreement involving a drastic limitation of naval armaments, but are based on the reduction of the Fleet to proportions, which in the absence of any such agreement and as far as can be seen at present, are considered to be reasonable in view of our permanent commitments, the comparative strength of other navies, and our unique situation of dependence on oversea communication.20.-     Oanital ships. (Beduce the number with full crews bjr 6, viz, fromciX. XO 10.r .

4 -5022.-     The 6 further ships to he reduced from full crews would comprise fhe four Iron Dukes and twoof the King beorge class.   The King George herself and.the Erin, which took the   . place of the Audacious in her division, are already in commission with reduced crews and it is proposed that these two oractically homogeneous divisions comprising 8 ships in all should he manned with&quot;reduced crews, and that the four ships of the Orion class should be relegated to.the reserve.   .    .&apos;    -23.-     The position in European waters as regards capital ships would thus he     -Instead of 21 with full crews there would he 15. &quot; .&apos; &quot; 6 with reduced crews &quot; &quot; 11 .8. &quot;     &quot;  13 with reserve crews       &quot;    &quot;  17.24.-     In order to maintain the efficiency of the ships in the reserve it must he arranged that in the event of a ship with reduced crews being taken in hand for a lengthy refit, a shin in reserve should he commissioned in her place.25.- From Appendix Table II, it will he seen that this number affords a reasonable margin of secu/rity against any probable combination.26.-    Light Cruisers.No. change.27.-     Tais is a class of ship which is specially required owing to the nature of our Empire and its interests and obligations, and the numbers necessary must he fixed without reference to the numbers possessed by other Powers.   No immediate reduction can be recommended if the squadrons are to carry out their duties efficiently.28.-    Destroyers *Reduce the number with full crews by 18, viz.from 91 to 73.Reduce the number with reduced crews by 18, viz. from 127 to 109.Further consideration may augment this reduction.29.-     The prospect of reducing the numbers of destroyers clearly denends to a considerable extent on the future of the submarine.   If submarine warfare is to continue it is considered that the possibility of the submarine being used illegitimately against our seaborne trade must be faced.  A nation in the position of Germany in the late war will have a well-nigh&apos; irresistible temptation to do as she did; .md to such tactics the destroyer is at present the most efficacious answer.3u.-t    If, therefore, an agreement is reached to prohibit submarine construction and warfare, the destroyers can he further reduced, but unfortunately the prospects of such an arr-ement are at present not very hooeful, and unless and until it takes place the organisation and strength of the flotillas must be such as to permit of rapid and considerable expansion.31.-     Nevertheless, even without the orohihition of vn^?f-neS,/Lls con^er!d that by 1920-1921 an appreciable ^nS2tl?n*of ^e Pr??ent strength can be accepted.   If the  K^rnJn ?w? thf CiT^al ^hiPs with full crews in European waters from 21 ships to 15 is carried into effect, the flotillascould .....
w 13 in 51could similarly be reduced either by relegating one of the Atlantic Fleet Flotillas to reserve or by using it to replace boats of the Home Fleet flotillas with reduced crews which would in their turn by relegated to reserve.32.-     In the two flotillas with full crews abroad no reduction seems possible.   The flotilla in the Mediterranean is necessary for duty with the capital ships of the Mediterranean Squadron and for other&apos; station requirements, and if the flotilla in China is to be of use at the outbreak oi war it must be kept fully manned on the station.33.-     The two Home Fleet flotillas with reduced crews should, it is considered, be reduced by one half but by halving each flotilla and not be abolishing one of them,   This procedure would have the effect of preserving the organisation of the two flotillas in case of expansion34*-     The remaining destroyers with reduced crews at home and abroad are in Local Defence Flotillas or employed on instructional and miscellaneous duties, and it is probable that some reductions might be made in their numbers; but any such reductions must be the result of careful enquiry and reports from. the. Senior Officers concerned, and cannot usefully be discussed in this paper.35e-    The effect of the foregoing proposals with regard to destroyers and leaders is thus that instead of 91 with full crews there will be 730 &quot; i? 127 with reduced crews 11 &quot; i? 1090 &quot;       &quot; 134 with reserve crews n    n    11   170.with a probable further reduction in the case of destroyers in commission with reduced crews.36,-     If this reduction takes place it will he essential, in order to maintain the effeciendy of boats in reserve, to transfer to them the crews of those destroyers undergoing long refit.The situation as regards our own submarines is, of course, absolutely dependent on the outcome of fie proposal to abolish this method oifi warfare; but if no agreement is&apos;reached a certain reduction may be possible under this head also.   Such reduction, however, will he less in proportion than in the case of surface ships, since if submarines are to be efficient they must be fully manned and frequently exercised, while a rapid 1 expansion of the submarine service,is difficult and undesirable. Furthermore, the number of men involved is comparatively small. No definite proposals under this head are therefore made.38.-      Effect of the above reductions.The saving of personnel consequent on the rele-gation of the ships proposed to a lower category would be about 11,300, i.e. the J.51,300 required for Post War Fleet on present basis would be reduced to approximately 140,000. ^   , No provision for Naval&apos; Air Force is included in either the 151.300 nor in the 140 - 000.The immediate reduction in Vote A, would not be so great as 11,3U0 as the surplus ratings referred to in the note to paragraph 9 would still require to be voted.These surpluses would be increased from about 6,500 to about 9.000 by the changes, so that the vote would still be about,149,000.It .....
It must be understood that this reduction entails a change in Admiralty Mobilisation Policy.  Hitherto the shins with reduced crews have been completed to full crws on mobilisation ba active service ratings, but by the foregoing proposals the balance will consist of reserves.  Although this will entail come delay in mobilisation, it is considered that if the situation develops on favourable lines the Admiralty should be in a position to accept, it.39.-     The reductions outlined in the foregoing proposals are confined to actual seagoing units of the Pleet, and&apos; furthert reductions may be found possible in the instructional auxiliary and miscellaneous vessels attached to the Pieet and the ports. Such vessels, however, are essential to the production of a high-ly trained personnel, which will be more than ever necessary when its total numbers are reduced.   It must not be forgotten that the personnel of the Navy increased durin/r the war from 145,000lo 409,000 and should&amp;e peace personnel be farther reduced the nucleus remaining must be of unquestionable excellence if it is to leaven the whole lump.40.-     Proposals therefore to cut down ships or establishments which are employed for training and which do hot in consequence form part of the striking arm murt from the point of view of naval efficiency be subjected to special scrutiny, and the Board are not yet ready with definite proposals on this point.41.-     The reduction of personnel moreover raises in an acute form the question of the method of providing sufficient reserves for the Fleet.   For the next ten years, say&apos;, it will probably be sufficient to rely on those men who have been trained in thePleet and are now in civil life; but with a large Navy and a small personnel, a long service system will not by itself pro-vide more than a fraction of the number the war has shown that we require.   Although this is not the occasion to discuss thequestion in detail the subject is one that requires and is receiving exhaustive study.&apos;42.-     It is felt that the time is not yet ripe for a consideration of the future building programme; and no proposals are put forward under this head, depending as they must do on factors which it is not yet possible to measure or appreciate.43.-     Appended are tables sho-ving the comparative strengths of our own and foreign Navies in 1919 and 1923-1924 (see Anpendix II), and Lists of Warships and Auxiliary Vessels building on the 11th November, 1918, showing (a) those which have since been cancelled, and (b) those which are bein?-r completed, giving the probable date of completion and the reason for not cancelling in each case.
