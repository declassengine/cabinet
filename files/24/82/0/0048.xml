b.Cent,51/6.MINISTRY OP MUNITIONS OF WAR, Whitehall Place,London, S. V., 1,20th June, 1919.,Sir,I am directed by the Minister of Munitions to refer to your letter of the 3rd inst. 26/E/24, and to state that the investigation ordered by the w&apos;ar Cabinet 569, Minute 1, docision (f), has been made as to the possibility of the immediate reduction of the Staff of the Aircraft Production Department and of housing the staff in offices elsewhere than in tho centre of London.   It is hoped that in addition to tho 60&apos;&apos; reduction mado In the staff since the Armistice, the following further reductions will be effected by the end of JuneInspection Department	(Headquarters)	250,i Contracts Department	92.Accounts Department	100,Supply Department	134,Finance Department	11.Establishment Branch	169,TOTAL	706,.The Minister desires to point out that the activi-? ties of the Aircraft Production Department are still ^ry considerable, as is evidenced by the fact that delivery is still being taken of 300 aeroplanes and Engines per week, and that for the period June to August between throe and four thou-and machines,are due for delivery, while at the end of August about 1,800 Machines will still remain to be delivered. It was not possible under War conditions to order complete -Machines from Contraotors, with the result that each demand for Machines involved Contracts with a very considerable number of Firms.   All the Machines now being delivered wore ordered under these conditions and tho volume of work remains very much, greater than would have been the case had it been possible to introduce the proposed peace time policy of ordering complete Kachines from a single Contractor,It is anticipated that when the Department is placed on a peace footing a total staff of about 950 will be required, for the Inspection, Production and Technical Departments and the Minister hopes that the staff of those Departments will be reduced 1o within 10%of that figure by the end of August.The Aircraft Production Accounts Department has still to deal \ ith the Accounts for commitments to the extent of some  30,000,000 still outstanding, and the clearing up of transactions with 400 main and 4,000 Sub-Contractors.   These accounts involve very difficult questions arising out of the issue of materials and components, of which, under the pressure of V^ar conditions, satisfactory records were not maintained. Until the records of such issues are thoroughly investigated a final settlement with Contractors could not be mode without involving the possibility of considerable loss of public money, In view of these considerations the Minister regrets that * drast
redaction of the staff of the Alrcrart Accounts Department in the near future does not appear to be possible.Tho Hintstor also instructs me to state thot his proposal to house the Staffs of the Dispose.Is Board Controllers at Earl&apos;s Court includes tho removal of 150 persons from Kingsmy, vhile the proposal to accommodate the Liquidation staffs at Alexandra Palace vculd lead to a further considerable reduction of tho numbers nov housed in Kingsr:ay.I am to st-ato that the delay in deciding rhich sections cf the Aircraft Production Department shall be transferred to the Air Ministry arc!   hich shall remain vith the Ministry cf Munitions has considerably hampered the reorganisation an% demobilisation of the Department.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd)   J.r. DULANTY.The Secretary,Offices of the Vi-ar Cabinet,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.3
