From Viceroy, Foreign Department, IWi June 1919. (Received 2 p.m.)Clear the line.- 914 S.   Afghanistan.   Following from Roos-Keppel dated 18th June : -(i Reported by Khyber that a party of about 500 Afridi deserters went to Jalalabad to interview General Ghulam Nabi.&quot; They said that they had sacrificed themselves for the sake of Amir, and asked what the latter would do for them. General Ghulam Nabi replied that, whatever individual services deserters might have performed, Afridis had betrayed Amir by not rising when called upon to do bo, and had also looted Jalalabad. On the return of deserters to Tirah they heard of start of the Afridi jirga mentioned in my telegram of 17th June, 1684 R. They pursued jirga, and informed the elders that they would prevent by force, if possible, any jirga going into Peshawar unless the jirga took them with them, and promised to arrange a settlement of their-case. They also threatened that if jirga came in without them they would attack Khyber communications in order to discredit jirga. A Kuki Khel jamadar in the Demand Department was killed by Gurkha picket on the Khyber road on the 16th instant. Ningrahar is reported to be in a state of anarchy; bands of armed men are wandering about looting villages and travellers. There is little or no traffic.   All quiet elsewhere.&quot;Following from Baluchistan dated 18th June : &quot; Belated message from Bruce regarding attack on Musa Khel shows it to have been conducted purely by Sherannis as Musa Khel having joined them. Attitude of Musa Khels was excellent throughout and actively loyal during attack. This is extremely satisfactory, in view of fact that Sherannis were well armed.&quot;
