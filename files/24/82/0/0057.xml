UNION OP BEAM ICS S BUI,(Copy of a letter from Sir, Claud Schuster to the President of the Board of Sduoation,)House of Lords,) S * i  *    1 .21st June, 1919.Dear Msher,The lord chancellor asks me to write to you with reference to the Union of Benefices Bill-, - You may remember that I mentioned this Bill when the Home Affairs Committee&apos;were dis-oussing the question of the tabling Bill and cited it as an instance of the difficulty which the Church finds in obtaining more machinery legislation under present arrangements,The Bill was introduced by the Bishop c-f Norwich in the House of lords during the Session of 1918.   It passed through the House of Lords without any adverse comment but made no pro-gress in the House cf Commons.   The Bill is of a nature which might have been expected to arouse some feeling in the House of Lords since it interferes considerably with the rights of private patronage.This Session the Bill was re-introduced in the Lords by the Bishop of Norwich and passed through all its stages with very slight formal amendments.   The galy opposition came from Lord Chaplin, and was based Ui.on an imperfect apprehension of the method in which the rights of private patronage were affected.The Bill left this House so long ago as the end cf March, and the Lord Chancellor then pressed Ivir. Shortt to expedite its passage through the House of Commons.   Mr. Shortt about that time saw the Bishop of Norwich but no effective step has been taken to advance it.   It is clear that unless the Bill receives Government support in the House of Commons, it cannot become law.I had some conversation with Ivir. Shortt, and at the Lord Chancellors request and with Mr. ShorttTs, assent I now   P write to inquire whether you will be so good as to bring the   A matter before the Home Affairs Committee of the Cabinet with a view to considering whether special facilities ought not to be given to the Bill&quot;in the Commons.The Lord Chancellor has no special personal interest in the Bill.   He, however, considers it highly meritorious in itself, and further that from a political point of view it is most desirable that it should receive every facility, and should do so at an early date, and that someone should be empowered to tell the Church people, through the Bishop of Norwich, that the Government will look after it in the Commons.   The reason for this is sufficiently obvious, but perhaps I ought to place it on record.   It i. , that in accordance with the views indicated
by tho Hone Affaires Committee the lord Chancellor proposes to ask the House of Lords to refuse a second reading to the Enabling Bill, and to say that there is at present no evidence-that tho new procedure of the Houtso of Commons will not enable the Churoh to get such non-contentious legislation as is necessary for good administration^Apart from these considerations, there is a certain urgency in connection with the Bill.   As its name implies, it is intended to facilitate the union of benefices.   Under the Ecclesiastical Services (Omission on Account of War) Act,1917 .   7 Ceo. V.c.5., special provisions are mado for the suspension &apos;of service in a church upon the authority of. a bishop during the continuance of the war, and for a period of three months after.   Advantage has been taken of this Act during the war to run two or more small oountry parishes together, the incumbent of one of them being absent with the Forces or on other national service.   Action under the Union tf Benefices Bill will be appropriate if it ccme into foroe before the time limit luy the Act of 1917 has expired, as it is antici-pated that many ef the oases in which the temporary suspension authorised by the Act of 1917 has been put to force may, with convenience t* the publio and to the advantage of the Church, bo made permanent.appearanceShe Bill, a oopy of which I enclose, is rather complex in/ but its provisions are stated fairly clearly on the memorandum prefixed to it.   I include in addition a short Memorandum drawn up in this office, and a white paper showing the sections of the acts incorporated with the Bill.The Lcrd Chancellor would be greatly indebted to you if you would bo so good as to ask the Home Affairs Committee to consider the matter at your early convenience.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.)

UNION OF BENEFICES BILL.Thia Bill hoc Loon introduced, twice into the House of Lords by the Lord Bishop of Norwich and. on both occasions, has passed through all its stages. Tho object of the Bill is to facilitate the union of benefices outside the Metropolis by dispensing with the existing limitation as to population, imposed by tho pj.uralitie.a^ Act, and rendering unnecessary the consent of the patrons of the benefices concerned.The existing law with reference to the permanent union of two or more benefices is to be. found in the Pluralities Acts 1838 and 1850 (1 &amp; 2 Victo 0.106),  (13 &amp; 14 Viet, c,98),   These acts make it possible, permanently to unite into one benefice two or more benefices situated in the same parish, or contiguous to each other and having an aggregate population of not none than 1,500 persons.   The procedure-ure under these Acts i.. shortly as follows:-If it appears to the Archbishop of the Province with respect to his own Diocese or if in other cases it is represented to him. by tho Bishop of the Diocese or the Bishops of two Dioceses, that t&quot;&apos;t union may be effected with advantage to the interests of religion,, and. upon enquiry the archbishop is satisfied that the Union may be usefully made and will not be of inconvenient extent, and that the patrons consent thereto in writing, he is to give public notice of the proposal, any person interested being entitled within 6 weeks to ghow cause in writing against the union.   If no sufficient cause against it is shown within that time, he is to certify the enquiry an&apos;&apos; consent of the patrons to the King in Council, and he may thereupon make an Order for the union.   The Order regulates the course and succession in which the patrons, if more than one, are to present to the united benefices, and in ether respects deals with natters affecting the benefices to be united.The Pluralities Acts make no provision for the permanent union of two benefices where the population exceeds 1,500 persons, or where the patrons concerned refuse to give their consent in writing to the union.   The primary object of the present Bill is to remove these obstacles and to^substitute as an ultimate Court of Appeal the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for the Archbishop of the Province.   The scheme of the Bill is as follows:-Section 1 empowers the Ecclesiastical Commissioners on their own motion, or on any representation made to them as to the desira-bility of uniting two or more benefices, to request tho Bishop of the Diocese to cause a Commission to be issued addressed to Commis-sloners, requiring them to report to the Bishop whether such union may with advantage to the interest?ts of religion be made, and to recommend terms for effecting any union in favour of which they report, and to deal with such matters as the course and succession of the patronage to the united benefices.Section 2.   Three. Commissioners are to be appointed, one by the Bishop of the Diocese, one by the patron, and the third commis-sioner, (who shall act as Chairman), by the&apos; Ecclesiastical Commissioners.Section 3 empowers the Lord Chancellor, with the advice and assistance of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, to make rules deal-ing with the necessary procedure for carrying out the Act.
Section 4 enacts that the lilahou on receiving the report of the three commissioners shall transmit it to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and if the Ecclesiastical Z^ym^lsBixm^cv, &apos;^oonrn^nd a union and the Bishop approves, a scheme shall he prepared by thq Ecclesiastical Commit loners which, with the assent of the Bishop, nay embody any modification of the proposals.   Drafts of the scheme are to be published locally and sent to the patrons, and objection^ to the draft scheme are to be transmitted in writing to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners within a prescribed time.   The Ecclesiastical Commissioners after considering any objections, and after making ouch alterations as the Bishop consents to, shall certify the scheme to His Fojesty in Council.By Section 5, after the scheme and consent of the Bishops affected have certified, public notice shall be given in a pre-scribed manner and time, and any person who has made objection to the draft scheme may u veal to the Judicial Committee^Section 6 calls for no comment.Section 7 provides that every scheme under the Act for the formation of a united benefice shall determine which house, if there is more than one, shall be tho parsonage house of the united henefic and Section 8 makes similar provision as far as the parish church is concenned,The rest of the Bill is comprised, for the most part   of administrative and financial provisions consequent on the passing of the Bill.The Bill has the approval of both the Canterbury and York Houses of Convocation, and also the Ecclesiastical Commission and Queen Anne5s Bounty, and if it becomes law and is administered with clue regard to the wishes and requirements of tho parishioners of the livings which it is proposed to unite, will it is believed benefit tho communities concerned and the Church, as there are many small country livings Contiguous to one another which do not, under modern conditions, provide sufficient income or work for one clergyman, and yet a union under the present law of such livings isi impossible owing to the Bishop of the Diocese affected being unable&apos; to obtain the written consent of one or both of the patrons concerne

Union of Benefices Bill.   [h.l.].[AS AMENDED ON REPORT.]MEMORANDUM.The object of the proposed Bill is, in view of the recognised desirability of a more systematic and comprehensive dealing with the problem of small benefices, to facilitate unions by removing some of the existing conditions and adjusting procedure and pro-viding means for a fuller review of cases in which unions appear to be advisable.The proposed Bill does not apply to the metropolis, for which there already exists an Act giving all necessary powers.It supersedes the present provisions of the Pluralities Act as to unions, applies to all benefices outside the metropolis, and provides for unions of neighbouring benefices without limitation as to population.There is to be a local inquiry in every case by three persons (in the Bill called &quot; the commissioners &quot;) nominated by the Bishop, patrons and Ecclesiastical Commissioners. The scheme for any union is to be prepared by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and is to be based on the recommendations made to them as the result of the local inquiry. The consent of the patrons to the union is not required. No scheme for union can take effect until it has been affirmed by His Majesty in Council, and provision is made for the hearing of objections and for appeals.Eebruary-1919.
