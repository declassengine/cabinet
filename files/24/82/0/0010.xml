ftft this   document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.SECRET.120 Gen. No. 8640WAR CABINET. 7 TRANSPORT OF TROOPS TO  INDIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.1. In connection with the question of the transport by sea of 20 battalions to India (to take place at the rate of two battalions a week commencing on or about 23rd June) the Ministry of Shipping was asked on 12th May to provide shipping direct from the United Kingdom to India. Certain special measures for the comfort and health of the troops were asked for as they had to pass through the Red Sea at the hottest time of the year. These measures included a reduction of the usual numbers to be carried, supply of ice, mineral waters, fans, &amp;c.2. On 20th May the Ministry of Shipping replied that it would be difficult to deal with these battalions (strength, 31 officers and 1,100 other ranks) by the, all sea route. They suggested that more than half should be carried via Marseilles and Taranto.3. On 24th May the Army Council replied that this could not be regarded as a satisfactory arrangement and adhered to their opinion that, on account of climatic conditions, exceptional efforts should be made to convey the whole of these troops by the long sea route, and that the military medical authorities pressed for this method of conveyance.4. On 1st June the Ministry of Shipping replied that they considered it undesirable to send men through the Red Sea before the end of September and could not accept responsibility for their despatch at such a time. If an alteration in date was impracticable, they made the following proposals : 4,200 men to be embarked at Marseilles and conveyed direct to India, the remaining troops to be carried from the United Kingdom in 18 ships, 4 ships to land all troops in Egypt, the remaining 14 ships to land in Egypt half the troops carried in each ship in order to reduce the numbers to be conveyed through the Red Sea. The troops landed in Egypt would be carried on to India in other vessels.5. On 2nd June the Army Council replied that they were unable to concur in the proposal to tranship iroops in Egypt and requested that they should be sent by direct ship from the United Kingdom to India at the, rate of two battalions a week subject to the former conditions laid down.6. On 12th June a letter was received from the India Office strongly emphasizing the necessity of providing roomy and comfortable ships and drawing attention to the risks involved by the journey at this period of the year.7. On 16th June the Shipping. Controller replied to the Army Council&apos;s letter of 15th May with regard &apos;to special measures and forwarded a programme whereby all the troops should leave the United Kingdom by sea, some of these ships to disembark all their complement in Egypt, others half their complement of troops. All troops disembarking would be re-allotted to other vessels directly connecting, so that none of the troops would have to be accommodated in rest camps. The Shipping Controller agreed to the percentage of troops to be carried on vessels with the exception of the numbers on the lower decks.   The other measures be agreed to.8. On 18th June the Army Council replied  hat for the important reasons of health and discipline they still considered that it was essential that the journey by sea should not be interrupted by the transhipment suggested. As the battalions would only partially consist of men enlisted on post-war conditions it was essential for discipline that the units should be embarked as a whole so that the commanding officer could exercise direct control.9. I therefore ask the War Cabinet to decide whether (a.) The 20 battalions should be conveyed in suitable ships by complete unitsdirect from the United Kingdom to India without transhipment; and (6.) This move is to take precedence over all other shipping commitments.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.19th June, 1919.(B19/287)  70  6/19  H&amp;s  7236wo
