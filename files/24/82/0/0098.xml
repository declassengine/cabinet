&apos;2 ti&apos;3 Document: is the Property of   ^V&apos;^H^,^^ S^H-^O., His,Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government ^55SUBMISSION TO WAR CABINET ON GENERAL QUESTION OP ACCOMMODATION FOR GOVERNMENT departments in LONDON.. An important measure of reconstruction which has now to be undertaken Is the provision of permanent headquarters accommodation for the Ministries and Departments whose pre-war Headquarters premises are now inadequate;   for the new Ministries created during the War, and for those now being created.2.     In this connection the Ministries and Departmentsresolve themselves into six categories?.-(1) Pre-War Departments whose staffs have remained more or less normal and whose existing accommodation is sufficient for their permanent needs.(2).Pre-War Departments whose staff numbers will be pormareitly increased as a result of the War, and who require permanent additional headquarters accommodation, e.g.,Treasury, Admiralty, War Office, Foreign Office, Colonial Office, Paymaster-General, Office of Works,Local Government Board (now Ministryof Health),Board of Education, Inland Revenue Department, &amp;c., &amp;Ct(3) Pre-War Ministries with scattered accommodation for whom concentrated headquarters accommodation is required, e.g.,Board of Trade,Ministry of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries, Stationery Office.(4) Pre-War Departments removed during the War fromWhitehall area to temporary premises, and who now desire to return, e.g.,Board of Education,Registry of Friendly Societies,Office of Woods.(5) New Ministries formed during the War now inoccupation of temporary Headquarters premises, for which permanent accommodation will have to be provided, e.g.,
Cabinet Secretariat, ministry of Pensions, Ministry of Labour,Pood Ministry (if to be permanent in alimited form). (The Air Ministry aro being provided forin Kingsway).(6) Hew Ministries noa being created for whom permanent accommodation will have to be providedMinistry of Supply,Ministry of ways &amp; Communications.3.     The whole question is a most complicated one, as the staffs of practically all the great Departments are fluctuating, some decreasing, others increasing, and it is impossible to estimate accurately the permanent future requirements of any one of the great Departments.One of the certain results of the War, however, will be a vast increase, probably not less than 30,000, in the permanent personnel of. the Government staffs in London.. In other words, the pre-War number (excluding Post Office staffs) of about 30,000 will be approximately doubled.4.     Certain schemes are already approved and are being carried out, viz(a) ip- provide concentrated accommodation for the Ministryof Pensions, Issue Office, by the erection of semi-permanent buildings at Acton for staff of 6,000.   The expenditure is about to be approved by the Treasury.(b) To remove Liquidating staffs (principally Ministry of.Liunitionsj to the number of about 4,000 to the &quot;Alexandra Palace.(c) To remove the Government Disposal Board staffs of theMinistry of Munitions to Earls Court.(d) To release certain Hotels by the removal to king george Hospital of about 3,500 staff.Other proposals are under consideration, viz:-(e) To acquire the whole of Caxton and Imperial Housesas permanent accommodation for the Ministry of Supply, whose Headquarters Staff is estimated at 2,500, This will &quot;involve the acquisition of the leases of a number of offices reQuisitioned from business firms, and the removal of others now in Caxton House.(f) To allocate Armament Buildings, upon its vacation bythe Ministry of Munitions staff (to be transferred to Caxton House) to the Board of Agriculture. This Building was erected for that Department.
(g) To increase the accommodation for the AdmiraltyHeadquarters by an extension building facing Whitehall,(h) To Increase the accommodation for the War OfficeHeadquarters by the erection of two additional permanent stories.(i) To allocate Cromwell House, Millbank, as a part of thepermanent Headquarters accommodation of the Ministry of Pensions.   These premises were originally occupied by the Registry of Friendly Societies ?jho were removed during the war to the British Museum.. I am now urging the Treasury to consent to other premises for them outside the Westminster Area*(j)   To remove the Admiralty Controller^ staffs from tho New Aiblic Offices to accommodation elsewhere, and a most urgent demand having   been received from the Board of Trade for Headquarters accommodation in the building, to re-allocate the whole of the space in the building in the following proportions:-Board of Education, 1100 staff (To return fromKensington).Ministry cf Health, 1300 staff (Estimated HeadquarteStaff).Board of Trade, 1100 staff (Concentratedaccommodation for Headquarters Staff in lieu of present scattered premises)H.M. Office of Works,1200_.sJ.aiX47005.     When King George Hospital, Alexandra Palace, Earl&apos;sCourt and the Acton buildings have been occupied there will still remain, apart from staffs housed in Crown Buildings and buildings held on lease, the following3400 in Hotels and Clubs. 4000 in Public Institutions. 9000 in Requisitioned Business Offices. 6500 in Private Houses and Flats. 9000 in Temporary Buildings in Parks and _ Public Spaces.51900Assuming that these staffs decrease by 12,000 during the next twelve months, this will leave approximately 20,000 for whom other accommodation will have to be provided *6.     After the fullest consideration of the whole matter I have come to the conclusion that the only possible
lution of this problem lies in two directions:-(a) To eroot semi-permanent buildings in Suburban a reason the lines already adopted in the case of the Ministry of Labour at Kew and about to be adopted in the case of certain Ministry of Pensions Staffs at Acton and Ministry of Health staffs on a site yet to be decided.     These buildings would have to accommodate, for a period of years, if not permanently, certain of the staffs which must be re-housed when their present premises have to be surrendered..   This, however, involves tho immediate consideration of the whole question of decentralisation, as such scheme^may include staffs of all the principal departments and could only be carried into effect by the direct instructions of either the War Cabinet or of a Committee appointed by the War Cabinet to investigate the matter and to give decisions having V/ar Cabinet force-     The necessary machinery for this appears to exist in the War Cabinet Committee on Government Staffs, though its torms of reference and power would have to be extended.(b) To erect permanent Government buildings upon theMontagu House, Whitehall Gardens and Richmond Terrace site to provide for the ultimate permanent additional Headquarters requirements of all Departments,    Such a building scheme is estimated to cost about  4,000,000 . and to accommodate some 17,000 staff..   Although the cost appears large it could be readily Justified, not only in the saving of highly rented premises, but also in the increased efficiency resulting from the concentration of large staffs in well planned buildings It should also solve the Whitehall problem for a number of years.   The scheme would really be an extension of the new Board of Trade Building Scheme which was approved before the War, but not carried out on account of the War.     It Is roughly estimated that the whole scheme could be completed in 6 years from the date of commencement of operations.     In view: of this and of the fact that a considerable amount of time would be required in the necessary preliminaries such as obtaining Parliamentary sanction, rehousing the staff at present on the site, etc., I should be Gjlad to receive general sanction to the principle of the scheme so that I can give the necessary instructions for more detailed plans and estimates to be prepared.7.     I therefore recommend that the War Cabinet approve:.-(l) The immediate consideration of the whole question of decentralisation by the War Cabinet Committee on Government Staffs with powers and terms of reference sufficient to enable th*m to give deoioions, the Committee working in the closest consultation with the First Commissioner of H.k. Works etc.(S) The acquisition of Caxton House for the Ministryof Supply (imperial House is already held).   A Bill may be necessary if the interests&quot;of the various tenants cannot be acquired by agreement.    It is, hov/ever, hoped that this will be possible-.(3) The allocation of Armament Buildings to the Board of Agriculture on its vacation by the Ministry of Munitions.
(4) (5)(6)(7)(8)The extension of the Headquarters accommodation of the Admiralty in Whitehall,The extension of the Headquarters accommodation of the Bar Office by the erection of two additional permanent stories.To allocate Cromwell House, Millbank, as part of the permanent headquarters accommodation of the Ministry of Pensions and for the Frierdly Societies Registry to be re-housed elsewhere.*To remove tho Admiralty Controller fs staffs from the Hew Public Offices to accommodation elsewhere, and to re-allocate the whole of the space in the buildings in the following proportionsi-Board of Education, 1100 staff Ministry of Health, 1300      i!
