&apos; J2il,S9BE?at !s the Property gf   W /i cy /       9nDEMOBILISATION OP MINISTRY OP POOD ^oCAi^BHSS MEMORANDUM BY THE FOOD controller.&apos; .)jl submit tho queotion of the future of the Ministry 6f Foodifor the further consideration of the War Cabinet, in the circumstances.    -An immediate decision is essential.On the 1st May I submitted to the Cabinet a Memorandum on the Demobilisation of the Ministry of Pood (G,T. 7175) which wasconsidered by them at a special meeting on 5th May.    The decision then reached was in favour of breaking up the Ministry and distributing such permanent items of work as remained among the various permanent departments; it was left to the Home Affairs Committee to settle the detailed allocation of duties. On the following day in the House of Commons I followed the line thus laid down by the Cabinet.Even before the 1st May, however, a tendency to an increase of world prices of certain articles of food was already showing itself, and some private traders were experiencing difficulty in obtaining adequate supplies.    This tendency has been accent-uated.    As a consequence there has been an undoubted reaction of public opinion in favour of control; indeed, public opinion, in so far as it can be judged by reports from Pood Commissioners and Food Control Committees and by representations made to the department on behalf of traders and consumers alike is nearly unanimous in favour of control.    Recently the Prims Minister has expressed some concern as regards the food situation generally and Mr. Bonar Law has suggested that some further control over imports at least might be desirable.    Accordingly I bring the matter before the War Cabinet again with a view to getting a definite decision as to the policy to be adopted.In the first place, it is necessary to discount in advance any extravagant hopes as to what can still be accomplished by food control.    Assuming as I think we must assume - that inter-national (and not merely inter-allied) control of food is impract-impracticable, and also that we cannot contemplate the continuance of the 2,000 Pood Control Committees with their full administrative expenditure of a million to a million and a half pounds a year, the possible scope of utility of the Ministry of Food and the degree to which it can influence prices are distinctly limited.The question whether, in the circumstances, it is or is not desirable to maintain a Ministry of Pood or other single depart^ ment directly responsible for food questions as a whole is one in respect of which there are weighty arguments on each side. On the one hand the maintenance of a Food Department will undoubt-edly give rise to popular expectations, some of which cannot be realised.    Such a department in the future may be one of the &apos; most unpopular instead of perhaps the most popular department of State.    On the other hand, in respect of any articles which are definitely in short supply and therefore tend to obtain a scarcity value, a Food Department can, even without international co-operation, by itself importing and distributing supplies, check profiteering in this country and can thus keep prices below the point which they would otherwise reach.    Moreover it will probably]y diminish unrest and resentment against the Government as a whole, if there is some one department or Minister to whom the public may turn in any difficulty as to food, and who can be regarded as responsible either for finding a remedy for grievances or for showing that a remedy is impossible.It is impossible, with any accuracy, to foretell the future of supplies and prices, and with:, any confidence to say whether on the whole control or de-control will be economically the most advantageous.    VJhile the economic argument/
is thus uncertain, I feel that on &quot;balance the political argument is clearly in favour of the maintenance of a food department, at any rate over the    following winter.The Cabinet have now, I suggest, to decide between three main alternatives(1) To confirm the decision already reached, abandoning food control as such and distributing a few continuing items of work among the appropriate departments0    These contin-uing Items will naturally include the work of the Wheat &quot;Commission and the Sugar Commission in buying and selling imported wheat and sugar, and it would be possible also to continue without difficulty, under the Board of Trade or some other department the importation of such articles as bacon and butter.(2) To vary their previous decision and continue the Ministry of Pood, temporarily, till, say, June 30th of 1920.(3) To vary their previous decision and maintain food control as one function of a permanent department.    This might be either an existing department such as the Board of Trade (which is particularly concerned with trusts) or a new permanent depar-tm&amp;nt for Food Supply and Production combining the functions of the Ministry of Food and the. Agricultural Departments.Each of the last two alternatives is practicable or useful only on the following conditions(a) The Food Control Department must be empowered to trade in food and must be expected and permitted by the Treasury and the traders freely to exercise this power.(b) The Food Control Department must be able to obtain absolute priority of shipping space for adequate supplies of food, whether bought by it or by private traders.(c) The Government must be prepared, if necessary, to grant subsidies on food in order to keep prices at a reasonable levelo(d) The Ministry of Food must forthwith be removed from the category of departments subject to demobilisation, and must be freed from all prefure to demobilise and to reduce staff, such as is now being exercised by the Treasury and the Minister of Reconstruction.As between the last two alternatives the balance of politicalexpediency is probably in favour of the former.    The continuanceof the Ministry of Food as such will mat nearly meet the popular demand.    It is also the line of least resistance.On the other hand, from the point of view of administrative efficiency, the advantage lies clearly in the transference of food control to a permanent department.    A purely temporary department, as the Ministry of Food now is, must lack authority with traders and public; cannot undertake schemes such as milk control, which must be permanent or at least indefinite in their extension ; and cannot retain tho necessary staff.In conclusion, I feel bound to press for an immediate decision. The Ministry at the moment is being put in an impossible position by my receiving on the one hand authoritative suggestions that control should in some directions at least continue, and, on the other hand, instructions and requests from tho Treasury and Sir Auckland Geddes to de-control more rapidly.     It is also Bteadily losing public confidence by being unable to adopt and declare a definite line of policy.
Moreover, action on a-number of practical questions of immediate urgency is being prevented :-*(a) If,* for instance, the de-control of home-grown meat is to take place on September 50th, as at present arranged, arrangements should be put in hand almost at once to terminate the tenancy of the area offices and to give notice to the staff.   If., however., the Ministry or any other department is to be held responsible for regulating the price of home-grown meat throughout the winter, the whole of the livestock organisation (including 1000 full-time officers and large numbers of part-time members of grading com-mittees, auctioneers, &amp;c. ) would have to be retained. A decision on this- point in the course of next week is essential,(b) If the Ministry of Food is to be held responsible during the winter for securing to each, individual his fair share of butter (as distinct from margarine or other fats) tho whole existing organisation of Food Committees must be retained, and the life of the Food Committees themselves prolonged beyond November.   At present the staff of the Committeesis rapidly being demobilised,(a)   The Milk supply of next winter is being endangeredby the impossibility of announcing the policy regard-ihg it, while it is still uncertain which department will deal with the subject and. on what principle.(d)   If the Ministry of Food or any other department is to be held responsible for the price of eggs next winter, it ought to be now arranging for purchases of imported eggs, so as to be able to control profiteering.These are only a few instances which might be multiplied Indefinitely,It is urgently necessary to clear the position once and for all.     I ask the Cabinet, therefore, to decide:^(l)   Whether food control is to terminate or continue?(2)   Whether it is to continue on a strictly temporary basis or be attached to a &quot;permanent department?(3) If the latter, to what permanent department,, whether now existing or to be newly created,, it should be attached?I attach a Memorandum of the Consumers&apos; Council on the continuance of Food, Control,,I am submitting to the Viar Cabinet a separate Memorandum on International Food Control with particular reference to- the question of joint purchasing arrangements between the allies and other countries.   The general view there presented is that since full international control, covering selling as well as purchasing countries and allies,, neutrals and enemies alike, is almost cer-tainly no longer possible,, this country will do best if it stands altogether alone.   The decision on this point may, however, be affected by general political considerations,, and its consideration should not affect the present issue,.fGEO H. ROBERTS.Ministry of Food. 13th June, 1919.
MINISTRY OF FOOD.Report Adopted by the Consumers] Council on the Future of the Food Ministry.The Consumers&apos; Council have further discussed the question of de-control and the demobilisation of the Ministry of Food, and have presented the following Report to the Food Controller with a request that it shall be transmitted to the Prime Minister and the War Cabinet.i. There is nothing more important in the life of our people than their food. Good quality certified, full weight guaranteed, abundant supply assured, equitable distribution for all classes maintained, low and staple prices legally regulated these are the main points. They cannot be dealt with satisfactorily in the interest of the consumers, who make up the entire population of this island, if the problems of production and importation are separated from those of distribution and control. A central department is imperatively needed in order to co-ordinate and supervise the provision of food for the people.2. Two proposals have been placed before the Consumers&apos; Council by the Food Controller for dealing with the future of food control.The first of these is to give control in each case to the permanent department which.is held to be best qualified to deal with it. This would mean the breaking up of the Food Ministry and the distribution of those of its functions which were retained, amongst various Government Departments, already in being or about to be created.The second proposal is, that measures already enacted for the control of food should be concentrated in a separate division of a permanent department; possibly with a special Parliamentary Secretary directly responsible for this food division.3. The Consumers&apos; Council is opposed to both these alternatives, and suggests that a third course of action be pursued, namely, that the present Ministry of Food should be retained, and that it should exercise all functions with regard to the control of food. The reasons upon which the Council bases this view are expressed in general terms in the speech of Sir Thomas Allen at the meeting of the Consumers&apos; Council held on April gth last.4. The Reforms Sub-Committee now endeavours to give, in greater detail, the grounds upon which the Council has come to this conclusion.5. The public does not realise the complete chaos which formerly existed in its own food supply. Before the war three departments and three departments only were concerned in any way with food. These were the Board of Trade, which dealt with certain questions of importation; the Local Government Board, which administered a few laws regulating the quality of food for use as human food ; the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, which concerned itself generally with agricultural production and with fishing facilities.6. The number of laws in force with regard to purity and honesty of supply were exceedingly few ; the chief were those which related to meat, milk, margarine, the weighing of bread and its sale by weight, and other matters mentioned under the Food and Drugs Act. Even in connection with these commodities the law was very scrappy, and the public was imperfectly protected. The consumers, speaking generally, had no protection in the quality, weight, or price of the food which they bought, nor was there any attempt to provide increased supplies or to prevent waste.The whole question was left to the food trader, and the consumer was practi-cally at the mercy of profit-making enterprises. There was no control over prices, nor over distribution, and no power of intervention in order to secure equitable dis-tribution, where there was scarcity, or to develop production in order to do away with that scarcity. Only those consumers who were members of co-operative distri-bution agencies had any power of control whatsoever, and even here the co-operative movement was greatly hampered by the powerful interest of private enterprise.C551.

j. The conditions brought about by the war greatly increased all the evils of the old chaotic system. Difficulties due to scarcity became extreme, and distribution was greatly dislocated. Private enterprise naturally took advantage of this state of things to increase prices, and the consumers were more than ever at the mercy of the trader in relation to quality and adulteration.The efforts of the Ministry, during such portion of the war period as it has been in existence, have been to find means to increase the supply and improve the distribution, to get full value for the consumers, and to protect them against profiteering, both in regard to price, quality and weight. To the public at large it often appeared as if the work of the Ministry of Food was in the main that of rationing under the coupon system, and when the coupons were abolished they were inclined to believe that nothing remained for the Ministry to do. In our opinion this is a fatal error, for the greatest value of the Ministry&apos;s work has been in the control not of the retail but of the wholesale market, and its influence in affecting international as well as national food supplies.8. The Consumers&apos; Council has already recommended that a large number of reforms, introduced by the Ministry under the Defence of the Realm Act Orders, should be made permanent by legislation, and these deal with the following improvements in the method of trading: (a) Nett weight.(b) Compulsory specification for certain articles.(c) Control of supply and distribution of milk.(d) Testing of seeds.(e) Exhibition of notices.9. As to the prevention of waste the Council has been and is strongly in favour of the policy of National Kitchens and Restaurants, and believes that that system should not only be continued but extended.io.   There remain, however, two very important branches of food control: 1.  The policy of purchasing and importing essential foodstuffs.2.  The control of their distribution and prices.They are of opinion that the time has not come when control can be set aside with advantage to consumers in general, and they are fully justified, by the result of de-control in the case of fish, bacon, oils and fats and other articles of food, in urging the continuance of supervisory powers.11. The question which they have further considered is the way in which the powers can best be exercised.The Ministry of Food has during the War not been the only Government Department concerned in the food question. In one way or another the Board of Agriculture, the Board of Trade, and the Local Government Board have exercised important functions, while the War Office, the&apos; Admiralty, the Foreign Office, and the Ministry of Shipping have been greatly concerned in different branches of this work. The functions of the three departments first named have been similar to those which they exercised before the War, but they have necessarily been extended in many directions by war conditions ; while the business of the second group of departments has been entirely that necessitated by conducting military and trading operations during the period of hostilities.,12. During the last fifteen months the work of the Ministry has been brought into close contact with the consumers as the result of the formation of the Consumers&apos; Council, and the most important feature of the work of this Council has been to review and criticise the policy and administration of the Food Ministry and of the other Departments in their dealings with food. It has been possible by this means to bring together all work connected with the supply of food to the people, to keep the Department in touch with the consumer, as well as to influence its operations by the advice tendered to the Ministry in the name of the consumer.13. In considering future policy we may first deal with the suggestion of breaking up the Ministry and distributing its functions amongst existing departments. An immediate effect of this would be that the consumers would lose the close connection with administration which they now enjoy. In the same way, each department to which its present functions might be allocated would cease to have any view of the food situation as a whole. In the opinion of the Consumers&apos; Council, one of the greatest difficulties in food administration has been the fact
that so many departments have to be consulted. By this official suggestion that difficulty would be greatly intensified. Moreover, no department other than the Ministry of Food, which now deals with such matters, looks at them from the con-sumers&apos; point of view.The Board of Agriculture takes the point of view of the producer of food.The Board of Trade takes the view of those engaged in commerce, and is concerned with food not as a commodity for human consumption, but as means of making profit.The Local Government Board, or the Ministry of Health which will replace it, regards the question from the point of view of health, but without consideration of the economic side of the matter, or of the methods of production, manufacture, transport, distribution, etc.14. As to the second official proposal, namely, that of creating a Food Depart-ment of a Government Ministry which would be mainly occupied with other matters, there is no existing department which could suitably undertake this work. It is in fact far more disadvantageous to the consumers than the proposal of retaining the Ministry of Food, and giving it its full status. The functions which ought to be retained are much too important to the nation to be given an inferior position. So far from forming a subordinate part of any existing department, we are convinced that those departments now occupied with the production of food, such as the Board of Agriculture, might more fitly become an integral part of the Food Ministry itself. Though, also, full co-operation with the Ministry of Health is requisite in carrying out any legislation dealing with the purity of supplies, we feel sure that the Ministry of Health cannot suitably exercise the necessary functions of control over food.15. We contend, therefore, that the Ministry of Food should remain in exist-ence and continue to exercise full powers over production, distribution, and prices of food.   Included under these headings would be : (a) The Control of Milk.(b) Supervision of supplies of all necessary food both at home and abroad, with power to secure fairness of distribution and reasonable level of price.(c) Administration with regard to the economic consumption of food by the development of the system of National Kitchens and Restaurants.(d) Administration of present and future legislation of which the object is to secure honesty of trading and protection of the consumer generally.16. We are further of opinion that there should be attached to the Ministry of Food a Consultative Council on the lines of the Consumers&apos; Council representing the interests of the public generally in all matters of food supply.17. In this way the successful organisation and wide experience of the Central Ministry of Food will be taken advantage of, instead of being wantonly dissipated; the one Department which has gained the confidence of the public during the war will still carry on its useful work in peace; and important steps will be taken towards introducing order into the chaos that has hitherto been so marked a feature in food administration.14th May, 1919.
