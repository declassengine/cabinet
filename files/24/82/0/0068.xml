hi hi 4.  On 9th naj i 1910 the Hoard entered on and took possession under Defence of the Realm Regulation 2 M (1) (a) of the Farm of Hill of Ooldwolls, Aberdeenshire, which, owing to the tenant beins i&amp; financial difficulties, was not adequately cultivated. A member of the East Aberdeenshire- Agricultural Executive Com: :mittec agreed to undertake the general supervision of the cultivation of the holding on behalf of the Board.    The farm was cultivated in accordance with a scheme submitted by the CciYeT!ittee and approved by the Board, the necessary expenditure being defrayed from moneys advanced by the- Board.    An agree: :mont was drawn up with the tenant whereby the proceeds of cultivation were to be handed over to him after the Board had been recouped for their outlays.    This arrangement was carried out and the farm was worked efficiently.     The tenant subse: rquently arranged with the proprietor for a renunciation of his lease as at Whitsunday last and, as the amounts advanced by the Board have now been refunded, they have withdrawn from occupation of the farm. -2, Agricultural Machinery and Implements:   Sales by the Board&apos;.DurTng&apos;Tiio week the following tractors &quot;anT&apos;tracTor Tmple : tmenta were sold by Auction at Lanark:-   16 tractors, 24 tractor ploughs;   8 tractor cultivators and grubbers;   1 disc harrow, and il binders.     &quot;Fordson1&apos; tractors realised up to  180 each , and three-furrow &quot;Oliver&quot; ploughs fetched up to  46 each.
