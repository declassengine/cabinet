Following received from Chief Political Officer, North-West Frontier, dated 26th June ; &quot; Rough translation of letter from Amir to Viceroy, dated 19th June, received Laudi Kotal 26th June :-&quot; After complements I have lately received constant (?) reports from several sources that persons from independent territory have been committing raids on your camp at Dakka, situated in Eastern portion of my realm ; it is probable that they may induce some of my subjects to join them, and it will be difficult to restrain them, as the (unintelligible) your camp in Afghanistan is causing great excitement which may lead to difficulties in our relations. As negotiations are taking place between the two countries, I think it is necessary as your friend to give this advice to your Excellency that during the negotiations your troops should return to frontier; this will also remove my anxiety. As the negotiations are shortly to take place, I consider it is necessary to inform Your Excellency this in a friendly manner. Your Excellency may please take such action as you may think lit in your own interests.&quot;
