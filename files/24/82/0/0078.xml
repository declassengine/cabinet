Tlfol^ pOCUITH;Mia aritannicant Is the P^BSSJLindent     27th Juno, 1919;   THUD (I Ml(ii!Ta.JlJ:H3LBALiril^ Admiralty Memorandum for the War Cabinetass,*Wf,6Al-lfyS?^e Admiralty would observe that to anyone who has watched the development of the situation in the Baltic provinces during tho past months it must be apparent that the German Policy has consistently aimed at obtaining&quot; control of these provinces.a At first it is probable they only aimed at controlling* the Southern States but with,the arrival of the increased forces, it now looks as if an attempt was to be made to overthrow the Esthonian Government.Should this be achieved the Germans will control the whole country from East Prussia to Petrograd.It is unnecessary to point out the serious consequences and far reaching effects which will ensue should this cone &apos;to pIt is desired to point out, however, that Naval Forces are powerless to prevent this.There.can be no question but that the power of the Navy to control the situation in the Baltic has been overrated from the beginning with the result that too little attention has oeen paid to improving the situation on land.If we are to prevent the Germans from joining hands with Russia this,,policy must be reversed and tho Navy looked upon solely as a guardian of the lines of communication to the ports through which supplies are given to the forces operating in accordance with Allied Policy.Past experience has shown how impotent the Allied Representatives in the Baltic Provinces are to obtain redress for insults br to make the Germans conform to our demands.But it must be pointed out that the Admiralty labours under a great disadvantage in having to conduct a minor war of the nature without definite knowledge of the wishes and intentions of H.M, Government, and that this want of knowledge operates adversely On the Officers in the Baltic force.    Neither the Admiraltynor the Officers concerned can feel certain that tT,eir actions will be approved and every move has to be considered in this dim li^ht.A further complication annears likely to be introduced by the announcement that the So B. 0* proposes to allow &quot;commodities&quot; to proceed by sea to Bolshevik Russia, this announce-, ment being coupled with an enquiry as to whether the Admiralty 11 considered that &quot;munitions&quot; could&apos;be prevented from reaching the same source.The Admiralty would therefore welcome a decision that it is the desire of H.M. Government that the Bolshevik Naval Forces should be suppressed.   There can be no question as to their intentions as they have repeatedly endeavoured to attack Esthonia and have opened fire on H.1L Ships.     It is not fair to the $ Navy to employ it in the present fettered fashion.The
The Admiralty therefore consider that tho only remedy is for the German Government to he piven to understand that leads will not he ratified until they have sho&apos;.vn that thoy are honestly endeavouring to carry out the Armistice Terms by having withdrawn their troops from the Baltic provinces.It is also essential that as long as Petrograd is in the hands of the Bolsheviks or should it be captured by German forces or forces acting in collusion with the Germans no trade should be permitted to pass into or out of letrograd.In fact Fetroprad must be fed by the Allies alone and not even by the allies until those we are helping are in occupation.To force the Germans to evacuate the Baltic Provinces and let in Bolshevism is preferable to allowing the Germans to remain in pofsession, but by redoubling our efforts in suonlyinft munitions and equipment we may ho able to keep the Bolsheviks out also.2,0 am ni3.(l) Peace should not be ratified until the Germans are out of the Baltic Provinces.(2) The Blockade of ! etrojrrad should be maintained until it is in the possession of our friends.(3) Supply of munitions and equipment should be redoubled and hastened.(4) The Navy should be rriven a clear lead as to the intention? of I!.!&apos;. Government.. femyss 27. 6. 19Forwarded.(Intd.) tt. H. L.27. 6. 19.
