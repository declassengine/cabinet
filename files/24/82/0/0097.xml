/ /.,/   Wxo       354/ - L,aL (1 fl(Thin -Document ia the Property of His Britannic 1 .a,j osty&apos; s Government) *1 &quot; &quot;     ..............V/ar Cabinet. roret.&quot;Herring Fishing Industry&quot;. ,T, 7507. &quot;&apos;&apos;Memorandum by the President of the Board of Agriculture and fisheries and The Secretary for Scotland.1. The Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland (G.T.7521)raises the question whether the guarantee for the purchase of pickled herrings is intended to cover Ireland as well as Great Britain, and if not, whether it should bo extended to Ireland,2, The proposals made in our previous Memorandum (G.T.7394), whichwere agreed to by the War Cabinet, related to pickled herrings cured, in Great Britain between 1st June and 15th September, 1919.     The representations made to us related exclusively to the herring fishing conducted from ports in Grout Britain, though in past years English and Scottish fishermen and some Scottish curers took part in the Irish fishing.     The Terms of Agreement whioh have been issued to curers in Groat hritaih for signature, if accepted, and which-have been published in the press make it plain that this guarantee is confined to herrings cured in Great Britain.3, The question whether the conditions in Ireland are such as tocall for a guarantee appears to be one for the War Cabinet to decide.4. We do not think, however, that out of the limited barrelage(400,000 barrels) fixed for Great Britain a share can be assigned to Ireland.    as already stated the previous discussions and the , announcements made have all proceeded on the footing that the total cf 400,000 barrels applies to Great Britain,     Fishermen and curers in Great Britain have made their business arrangements upon this understanding.     If the total applicable to Great Britain were now reduced, there would bo serious complaints that the basis oi their arrangements has been altered by the Government.5, If any similar proposals should be adopted for Ireland, v/ethink that they should be effected by issuing a separate document rather than by attempting to re-adjust the Terms of the existing agreement for Great Britain.     There are material differences of machinery between Great Britain and Ireland.     For example, for the purposes of the Schedule Of Prices in tho existing guarantee the fish are classified according to now Branding Regulations made by the Fishery Board for Scotland a few weeks ago.     These, we understand, differ in important respects from the Irish Branding Regulations. Moreover, the existing Terrs have been accepted and signed by many of the curers and it would be very inconvenient, if not impracticable, to substitute a revised form of agreement.ROBERT MUNRO.July 2nd. 1919,
