IMPERIAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE.



PROPOSED COMPLETION OF GOVERNMENT WIRELESS STATIONS AT LEAFIELD (NEAR OXFORD) AND ABU-ZABAL (NEAR CAIRO0.

Memo. by Lord Milner.



the Imperial Communications Committee, at their Fourth Meeting on the 11th June, 1919, considered a proposal by the General Post office to complete the Government wireless stations at Leafield (near Oxford) and Abu-Zabal (near Cairo).



EXISTING PLANT, BUILDINGS etc. AND INITIAL COST.

The situation as regards the two stations in question is as follows :-



LEAFIELD.



At Leafield, masts for a powerful station were erected in 1914, buildings constructed, water supply provided and roads made: and, as an emergency measure during the war, the station was used for receiving messages but is now rendering no service.



Abu-zabal.

At Abu-zabal good buildings and residences for operators exist, but an emergency plant erected during the war is now obsolete.

The cost of the work carried out up to date at the two stations is estimated to have been least £80,000. The greater part of the capital thus invested, at present idle, would be rendered productive if the stations were completed.



ESTIMATED COST OF COMPLETING AND WORKING STATIONS.



The General Post Office estimate that the approximate cost of Completing and equipping the two stations with 200 kilowatt arcs by the early part of 1920, would be £170,000: and that the working of the stations, with the traffic which may be expected, should, within a short time of their completion, bring in an annual income of about £50,000, which is likely later on to be substantially increased.



The.......




The operating charges (for key speed) are estimated at about £20,000, and the engineering costs (including staff and fuel) at the same amount. Thus the stations would, at an early date, cover their working cost, and leave a substantial sum ever for replacement of plant and for writing down the initial expenditure.



ADVANTAGES OF COMPLETING THE STATIONS.

The advantages which would, it is thaught, accrue from completing the stations are :-

(a) The Cable services between England and Egypt, which are unable at present to deal efficiently with the traffic, would be relieved.

(b) Practical experience in the working of High-Power Wireless Stations would be afforded to our engineers and wireless experts: and it is of the utmost importance, in view of the certain development of wireless communications on a great scale, and the proposals which are under consideration for an Imperial Scheme, that such experience should be quickly gained.

(c) The Governments of Foreign Countries, notably France and the United States, are making rapid progress in State-owned and operated High-power point-to-point wireless development, and there will certainly be great dissatisfaction, both in the United Kingdom and the Empire at large, if we do not now make a serious beginning in the development of wireless communication between different parts of the Empire. The Committee are of opinion that no other beginning would be so quick, so practical and so inexpensive as the completion of the Leafield and Abu Zabal Stations.

(d)......


(d)   It is of groat urgency that tho British Government should &quot;got into the ether1&apos;&apos; internationally with the least possible delay, since at the present moment the &quot;best waves for long distance wireless cemmuni-cation aro being allotted in Paris9 and the British representatives are not in a position to demand the allocation to Great Britain of the necessary waves, as long as they aro unable to show that wo actually require thenio(g)     Two British wireless companies aro in treaty with the Serbian and Grook Governments for the erection of stations at Bo&apos;Igrc&apos;ie and Athens, and a corresponding station is needed in the United Kingdom-.( I Khen order is re-established in Russia there will bo a great demand for commercial wireless communication with England: a similar demand will come from Poland and Gz-ooho-Slovakiao We havo at present no means of satisfying it, but tho Loafiold station, if completed&apos;,, would bo able to communicate with these countriesADDITIONAL GOIiSIDi&amp;ratio^The completion of the two stations in question wouldoonstituto the beginning of an Imperial Wireless Service0   Sucha scheme must, ultimately., be on a much larger..scale, but it would groatbe indefensible to do.nothing, while other/countries aro pushing rapidly ahead, because wo aro not ready with a complete scheme for wiroless communications throughout tho Empire. These stations are wanted at once and they will continue to be wanted, whether or not they ultimately form part sf the main Imperial wireless system,. Moreover, the experience gained in working them will bo invaluable in connection with the bigger scheme9ItEGOMEiCDAT ION.....
