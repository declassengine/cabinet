his Document is the Prnpprfy *r ^[ (U^8Br:.;mni3 (Vbjo^ Governmerit.Military Secret. 955ffTom Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,2lst June 1919.-^$W (Received 23rd, 10.30 a.m.)sss^6f57. 2.1st June 1919. Malleson in reply to request for estimate of the T3olshevic forces and possible aid they could afford Afghans, telegraphs 19th June : &quot;1. Transcaspia strength. Bayonets, 2,100; sabres, 600; guns, 4-inch on armoured train, 2; 3-inch gun, Q.F., 9; old pattern field guns, 3 ; machine guns ; Lewis machine guns, 28; maxim and colt, 4 ; aeroplanes 5, all unserviceable.&quot;2. Bolshevic strength on Dushakh front.    Bayonets, 4,000; sabres, 1,000;* guns, 6-inch on armoured train, 4; 3-inch guns, Q.F., 12; mountain guns, (6?); howitzers, 1; machine guns, numerous ; aeroplanes, apparently 1 or 2 serviceable. Included in infantry are 500 Austro-Hungarian prisoners of war.&quot;3. Transcaspian war staff lias no reliable information regarding Bolshevic strengths on other fronts in Turkestan. They think that there are as many as 20,000 towards Orenburg, few in Semirechia. Not more than 300 gone to Kushk post so far. They state that after Bolshevic advance to Tejend at least 5,000 men were withdrawn from Transcaspia eastwards.&quot;4. Provided that payment was made, large numbers camels would be forth-coming for Bolshevic movement off railway, but probably there is no organised supply of supply and transport system. There is not sufficient material on which to base supplies of (? forces) they could spare off railway. So much depends on events on Orenburg side which is main thing with them. They should have no difficulty whatever in capturing Askabad and whole line to Krasnavodsk if they pushed this now, and thereafter only small force would be required to maintain their hold on country, provided that they abstain from atrocities and tyranny, coast people are listless and apathetic. For operations in Afghanistan they might perhaps spare force of 5,000 men, to be increased to 8,000 on subjugation of Transcaspia and further increased if Bolshevic Eastern Armies in (? corrupt group) open up Orenburg route. The actual military value of such force would in our experience be small, but their moral effect in Afghanistan might conceivably be very great.&quot;
