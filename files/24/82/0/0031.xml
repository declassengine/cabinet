902 S. Secret Afghanistan. Following from Roos-Keppel, dated 17th June. All districts reported quiet. I have (group omitted) Resident in Waziristan to exclude all Mahsuds from Dera Ismail Khan and Kohat Districts until Government of India has decided on policy to be pursued with regard to tribe and settlement has been made with Mahsuds in accordance with such policy. Tochi reports General Nadir Khan has announced that he is leaving Gardez, but it is believed locally that he has been summoned to Kabul. Tochi continues punishment of local Waziris. Kuram reports considerable activity prevailing among Afghans on border from Lak Kotga to Peiwar and increase in number of tribesmen at Pweiwar and Kharlachi. Mullah very active among Afghan tribes on Kuram border and tribe reaping harvest earlier that usual. Donald reports from Sawlawi that while Orakzai as a whole are resisting Mullah&apos;s incitement to rising, raiding is increasing partly, on account of natural rapacity of tribesmen in time of unrest, partly that Orakzai may be able to show under the conditions that they have done something in event of fresh outbreak of war and possible Afghan success. Rumours that Afghans will resume hostilities four days after the Id are causing alarm amongst traders, especially Hinds, in Kohat Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan; many are leaving with their families and property for the Punjab. Khyber reports that gang(s) that fired upon a Gurkha picket near Jamrud on 15th, were Kambar Khel bad characters led by one, Wazo a pensioned Jamadar of the Indian Army. Raiders were pursued by Kuki Khel village lashkar who shot one. Drought in the Khyber is very severe and may force evacuation of Khyber villages by the Zakka Khels. General Officer Commanding is endeavouring to arrange for Zakka Khels to get a share of the Ali Masjid water. Chaknawa Mulla has returned to Mulla Khel and has given out that there will be no Jehad (? until after the) Id.

Kafirs had a few casualties. Syed Badshah went to Asmar with 40 men to join Afghans against Kafirs without knowledge of Nawab of Dir who promptly recalled him and he has now returned.

"Naid Salar of Jalabad has arrived at Asmar to enquire into facts of unauthorised attack on Chitral. Latest reports from Badakshan and Wakhan do not confirm rumours of arrival of Afghan reinforcements. There are said to be 300 Afghan regulars in Faizabad with 4 detachments of 100 infantry each at Shangharan, Panjab Ishkashim and Rustak, with 100 cavalry at Rustak. Assistant Political Agent has received petitions from Zebak and Wakhan where there are many followers of Aga Khan asking that Government will free these countries from Afghan rule. Fanatic Amir at Samasta has written to Sir Abdul Qadyum that he is doing his best to restrain his colony but that he finds great difficulty with Punjabi element. He declares Amir Amanulla declared war in order to save his throne and on account of internal troubles in Afghanistan. I am sending copy of his letter. Messenger who took Sir Abdul Qadyum&apos;s letter to fanatic Amir states latter was very pleased with contents. When the messenger arrived fanatic Amir was being pressed hard by his followers and surrounding tribesmen to start Holy War and many rumours were current in the colony of great Afghan victories. Messenger told people of our capture of Dakka and of bombing of Jalalabad and Kabul and the fanatic Amir was such pleased at his news as it had a quieting effect on Mujahidin. He showed messenger letters he had received from Amir ordering him to raise standard of Jehad in the (? Black mountain) and assured him that he would not do so, as the Amir had started the war for selfish reasons, and his cause was not just. On Friday, 6th instant, fanatic Amir preached a long sermon to the colony in presence of messenger in which he said he was keeping a careful watch on affairs, that he had received reliable information that Amirhad sued for peace, that there  


would certainly he no Jehad before the Id, and that his followers shoulcjj devote themselves to prayer and fasting for rest of Karnagan. Most of colony accepted this advice, but about&apos;50 foreigners, mostly Punjabis, defied fanatic Amir and&apos;left for Chamarkand to join revolted colony there. Messenger states fanatic Aiujr has remainder of Mujahidin at Samasta and the surrounding tribes well in hand, ana1 that he sent Sir Abdul Qadyum (? private) assurance that he meant to abidp by his word (? to the last).&quot;    \   :   ,Follpwingvfrom Meshed, 17th June&quot; All quiet at Herat to 10th June.
