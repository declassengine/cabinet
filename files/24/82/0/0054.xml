iThip Document ir, the Property ofHis Britannic flriajfesty&apos;s Government.)..,,9564( m\rom Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,2!st June 1919.(Received 10.30 a,ra,, 23rd.)21st June.   Malleson telegraphs 19th June :-Transcaspia.   Following is summary of information gathered by my officers just returned from Askabad :  &quot;1. Local army between 2,500 and 3,000 in all. Demoralised and useless, and would run before determined attack. Government feeble. Military Chief now General Savitski, nominated by Denikin. Old and feeble, and should be withdrawn and General Lazarev given full powers.&quot; 2. Majority of inhabitants Of Askabad have been evacuated to Krasnovodsk and (?) Baku or Bahrain Ali. Those who remain are Caucasus Turks, Persians and Armenians. These all claim immunity from military service, but would probably welcome Bolsheviks.&quot; 3. With loss of Merv and Tejend oats, food position in Transcaspia has become very serious. Estimated not more than six weeks&apos; supply of grain now available. Askabad Government urges that we move Echhran to allow export of surplus of grain stocks to Transcaspia.&quot;4. Intentions of Bolsheviks uncertain. Various theories are urged. (A) That they are merely delayed by complete destruction of Tejend bridge, and that as soon as that is repaired they will press forward devastation of Askabad and Krasnovodsk and endeavour to open up communication with Astrakhan. (B) That their main object was to obtain the grain supplies of Merv and Tejend, and that having accomplished this they are content merely to watch Transcaspian army, whilst they employ (? their) troops (? elsewhere). (C) That they are deterred from advancing west of Dushakh, owing to presence of British force in Khorassan, which threatens their communications. (D) That Bolshevik policy is not yet decided, but awaits result of negotiations with Afghanistan and events on Orenburg front.5. Tekee Turkoman said, not to be joining Bolsheviks and not likely to do so. On the other hand few will fight for existing Transcaspian. Government which they consider incompetent. A few hundreds are with army but come and go much as they please. Only in the unlikely event of military successes to Transcaspian troops would Turcomans again participate in numbers against Bolsheviks.&quot; 6. Yamut attitude uncertain, but their main policy said to be hostile against Kirghiz.   Askabad Government know nothing about southern Yamut.&quot; 7. Denikin from time to time promises aid, but has so far only sent 600 troops. He is simultaneously regarding Transcaspia as a side show which must he temporarily lost if necessary. If he cannot spare troops, I suggest that he might send a few strong-energetic and honest officers, and remove all present people except Lazarev.&quot; 8. Russian authorities do not consider that Bolsheviks will gain many men from their recent mobilisation decree for all Mahometans. Much depends on attitude of Amir of Bokhara. If he shows no active sympathy with Bolsheviks and Afghan aims, great bulk of Central Asian Mahometans will take their cue from him.&quot;
