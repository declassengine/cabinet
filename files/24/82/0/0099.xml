From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, 1st July 1919. Clear the line.Foreign Secret.   Your telegram of 26th June, 933 S.   Afghanistan.As you. recognise that His Majesty&apos;s Government are ultimately responsible for policy, I trust you will also recognise that it is their duty to form an independent opinion on the facts submitted to them, and their right to criticise, recommend and, in the last resort, direct. I can find nothing in my telegram of 19th June to warrant the suggestion that their support is qualified or ambiguous. The object which we both have in view is the same, viz., the speedy termination of hostilities. The doubt to which- His Majesty&apos;s Government were led by their own appreciation of the position was whether your methods were most likely to attain it. But, as a matter of fact they have sanctioned or acquiesced in your proposals throughout, and such sanction Or acquiescence necessarily implies their full support.
