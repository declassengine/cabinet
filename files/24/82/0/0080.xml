Note by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate a draft of this Bill with an explanatorynote.On grounds of urgency authority was givon by the Leader of the House to grant insurance for certain areas in advance of&quot;Parliamentary sanction, and through an oversight the Bill was formally introduced in Parliament before it had been circulated to the Cabinet.   I should now be glad of Cabinet sanction to have it printed and circulated, and to proceed with it in Parliament forthwith.A. 0. GEDDBS. 28.6.19.
OVERSEAS TRADE (INSUrMCS AGAINST ABNORMAL RISKS) BILL.Under this Bill, powers are sought to promote British trade in those portions of Europe where the disturbed political conditions arising from the War still constitute a serious and incalculable risk, which British merchants are unable to insure^ against,   tot is proposed is that the State (acting through the existing machinery of the War Risks Insurance Office) should provide facilities for the insurance of the-overseas trade of the United Kingdom with these areas.     ^The overseas markets for British industry haveHjeen thoroughly disorganised by the War.  Many have been temporarily lost and will be difficult to recover.  Some have permanently passed into the hands of our competitors. At the same time, the productivity of British industry has been largely increased.  British industry consequently requires not only the recovery of old markets, but also the opening of new ones, if it is permanently to re-absorb the labour now available.  Otherwise a period of acute industrial crisis is inevitable in the early future.It is already evident that industrial competition in the I world&apos;s markets will in future be much keener ihan it was before the war.   In the United States, the Government has set aside 1,000,000,000 dollars for the encouragement of export trade.  Undoubtedly British manufacturers and traders will need every possible facility and encouragement if thay are to hold their own in foreign markets.Though powers are sought to extend the measure,, as opportunity offers, to other countries, its first and immediate object is those parts of Russia which are in friendly occupation, and particularly Northern Caucasia. General Deaikm. the Commander-in-Chief of the Volunteer Amy. has state emphatically that his military operations woula be greatly facilitated if the embarrassment caused by a disaffected populace could be removed.  This disaffection, which in a great measure is due to absolute lack of the .simplest articles of daily necessity, provides ideal conditions for Bolshevik propaganda, and constitutes a permanent danger to the rear or the Volunteer Army.   The political effects of creating economic conditions in non-Bolshevik Russia which contrast favourably with those in Bolshevik regions are likely to be far-reaching.The importance of reviving and developing trade relations between this country and Russia cannot be too strongly emphasised.  Each country can supply to the other what it most requires.  While unemployment tends to increase here,our nsrchants tor markets lost elsewhere during the war - is in urgent need of the very comjDc.it ies of which we nave a surplusfcr export.  The potentialities of the &amp;ssian market are&apos;almost illimitable.   It is not improbable that ftissia will eventually import goods to an extent largely exceeding the total manufactured export of the United Kingdom.  In 1912, Canada imported gooas to the value of  15 per head of the population-/ Russia, a country in many ways similar economically, to the value of only 14/- per head.
Prompt action. however, is necessary if a footing in this market is to be secured.    Germany is not only starving for the raw materials and the food which she can obtain from Russia, but is admirably equipped for dealing with Russian requirements.    Before the war, nearly 5v$ of Russia&apos;s total import trade was in German hands.It is believed that the provision of insurance facilities will o,ffer at least; a partial solution of a difficult and serious problem, without discouraging private iriitiative or namoering independent effort, then normal trading conditions return, the necessity for State insurance will disappear and its withdrawal will cause no disturbance of trade.    The measure has the approval of eminent representatives of Commerce, Banking and insurance [in consultation with whom it has been evolved), it utilises the existing machinery of trade, imposes no restrictive control and can be put into operation without delay.Whilst it is difficult to estimate precisely the liability under this measure, it is intended that 30 far as may be practicable the premiums shall be such as at least would cover the losses incurred.    It is by no means impossible that no liability in respect of the main risk to be covered .(namely, seizure by Bolsheviks) will materialize, and the scheme would then show a surplus asi?as the case with the War Risks Insurance.In view of the urgency and importance of giving economic assistance to the areas controlled by General Denikin&apos;8 Volunteer Army, and in order to gain experience which will be valuable *n consideriiH the extension of the Insurance Scheme to other areas (e.g.Poland), it waa decided to grant insurance as from June 21st for certain areas in South-Astern Russia and the Northern J-aucasus^ The Bill, therefore, provides that the measure anall be deemed to have come into operation as from that date.
