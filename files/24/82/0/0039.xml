&apos;hlo Document is the Property ofill&quot;Interim Report on Army Officers&apos; Pay&quot;.I Admiralty Memorandum for the War Cabinet,158.,, \VvIJhder ordinary circumstances the Admiralty would not have desired to comment on the proposals of the War Office for fc/^. dealing with the pay of Army Off icers^ut. as it appears fromthe Interim Report put forward that some misapprehension exists as regards the position of the Naval Officer under the Admiralty proposals, a reply seems called for.In paragraph 12 of the report of the War Office Committee certain definite state usnts are made which cannot he allowed to pass unchallenged.    In the first place it is stated that &quot;the extra responsibility of command by junior ranks in the &quot;Navy, and the greater risk in peace, are compensated for by the &quot;very general grant of command pay, specialist pay,  etc., for &quot;junior Officers&quot;.     This statement   can only fcave been made through an imperfect knowledge of Naval conditions.    In peace a Lieutenant in the Royal Navy may be considered fortunate to obtain a command at the age of 36 nor can he begin to draw specialist pay until about the age of 24 or 25,     Further the number of Officers who can obtain commands is very limited nor is a command held throughout his career as a Lieutenant and Lieutenant-Commander.    To fit himself for the higher ranks he must have further big ship experience and on transfer he naturally drops command money.As regards specialists, only a small percentage of Officers are required and they are the ones who by their examinations for the rank of Lieutenant and their qualifications as sea Officers have shown themselves to be above the average in those qualities which go&apos;far to make a successful Naval Officer,    Specialist pay is granted neither for extra responsibility of command nor for the greater risk in peace of the Naval Service, it is granted for specific qualificationsfobta ined
obtained after a severe course of study and is just as much earned as Engineer pay in the wr;r.y or tho special pay granted to Officers who have passed the Staff CollegeaApart from the two olassos&apos;mentioned, junior Officers in the i;iavy, with very few exceptions, receive no additional pay whatevero   That they have extra responsibility Is recognised by the War Office and cannot be denied*   A young Lieutenant of 22 in charge of a watch at sea is for the time solely responsible for the dafety of his ship and the lives of the men in hero   So also is the more youthful Sub-Lieutenant when on the bridge of a destroyer. But it has never been proposed, as might be in-ferred from the memorandum of the War Office Committee, to recognise such responsibility by extra pay in any formoThe second statement in the paragraph quoted relates to payment for discomfort.   It is true that any very special degree of discomfort in the Navy Is recognised by the payment of hard-lying money, but a study of the Admiralty proposals would show that hard-lying money for Officers in future under peace con-ditions will practically be a thing of the past.     Officers serving in Destroyers will, while at sea, still have to spend 8 hours out of the 24 on the bridge, besides fulfilling other duties when not on watch.   They will still have to snatchsleep with their clothes on and forego a bath until theirnoreturn to harbour but for these there will be/monetary com-pensation.In this connection the discomforts and risks of Army Officers under war conditions are referred to by the Committee. The Admiralty would be the last to minimise In the slightest degree the hardships of Army Officers In the field.   They desire, however, to point out that, in so far as monetary recognition can compensate for these hardships, the ArmyOfficer....
Officer does receive field and other allowances as well as freerations.   The result of this is, as stated by a high authority,that whilst at the front during the present war Army Officers havebeen able to live on their allowances and remit all their pay home.In the Navy on the other hand war v/ith its increased hardships andpennyrisks does not result in one/being added to an Officers allowances.L. regards paragraph 13 of the for Office Memorandum it is recognised fiat, rank lor rank, the Army Officer will be olde, than tho Naval Officer under peace conditions, hut it has to be pointed out that the proposals of the Admiralty for lowering the ages of retirement do not extend to the Executive or Engineer Bran and therefore only affect a mere fraction of the total number of Naval Officers.   It might also be observed that in the present war the experience  has been all the other way.  Army Officers have reached high rank with far greater rapidity than could ever be possible in the Naval Service and, though this cannot continue, the advantage of the Army over the Naval Officer in the past few years has been very marked.Turning to paragraphs 14 and 15 it is observed that the scale of pay proposed for the Army is considered by the Committee to be considerably more moderate than that proposed for the Navy and Marines.  This statement can hardly be upheld when judged by the amount of money to be taken out of the Exchequer if the pro-posals of the two Departments are approved.  For a total of 10,000 officers the increased cost of the i/ar office proposals as regards full pay over the pre-war cost is estimated at  2,750,000 and the increase  over the rates in force to-day is  1,750,000.  Under the Admiralty proposals the increased cost over the pre-war cost is  2,5^0,vpp and over present rates is  1, 250,000
 1,250,000.    Further, the proposed reduction in Navalallowances in the nature of pay will be  60,000.    Thewni ohestablishment of Officers on/this cost is based is 11,350, vizt. the number of Permanent Naval Officers in the Service in the 1st April last.    Thus on the basis of over 1,000&apos; more Officers the Navy as a whole will extract considerably less out of the Exchequer.Turning to the tables whioh-accompany tho report of  he Committee it is necessary to correct some figures that have been incorrectly stated and to remove certain impressions that may be derived from other figures which are in themselves correct.    In Table B. if an absolute comparison is desired the Naval Cadet with pay - Ml - should be inserted. A Midshipman receives no command pay or any other extra pay whatever.   A Sub-Lieutenant is eligible for command pay but his chance of receiving it in pea.ce is absolutely nil.   The junior Lieutenant on 17s/- a day will not be in a position to receive command pay and can not qualify for ispecialist pay for several years.   The command pay of a Lieutenant-Commander under the Admiralty pro-posals is    3s/- not 5s/- as stated.   A junior Captain receives12s/- command pay, not 18s/-.As regards the table of ages it has to be remembered that the system of promotion in the Executive Branch of the Navy is totally different to that obtaining in the Army.-Promotion to Commander and Captain is by very stringent selection and numbers of Officers get left behind not in any way because they are inefficient but because others are con- . sidered more likely to succeed in the highest ranks.   Thus the Admiralty in framing the scales of pay has to provide for Lieutenant-Commanders serving up to the age of 45 and Commanders up to the age of 50. With
With reference to Table 0. as stated above 3 Ldshipmen never receive additional pay and Sub-Lieutonants praotioallynever.The emoluments of these two ranks afloat should therefore be  91 and  182 respectively.    As Officers of neither rank serve ashore with allowances it is misleading to insert any figures under the headings &quot;ashore&quot; and &quot;in London&quot;. Junior Lieutonants rarely serve ashore and never at all in , London.      The remarks previously made as to command pay of Junior Lieutenants, Lieutenant-Commanders and Junior Captains hold good here.    As regards Servants Allowance, this with very rare exceptions is not granted to Officers below the rank of Commander and under peaoe conditions is not granted at all to Officers in London^ The more correct figures would therefore beRankOonip- Serv Pay.
