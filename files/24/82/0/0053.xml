Th!3 Document is the Property of Hl3 Djjtannjc Majesty&apos;s Government.Fro?)?, Viceroy, Foreign Department, 22nd June 19.1.9. (Received 23rd, 2 p.m.)Clear the line.918 S.   Afghanistan.   Following from Roos-Keppel, dated 21st June :--&quot; Sir Abdul Qadyum was waited on yesterday in Khyber by a representative jirga of whole Zakka Khel clause. Jirga included all Maliks and elders except those Avho are openly in the Amir&apos;s pay. Jirga stated that they had got most of their young men under control and hoped to be able to prevent them committing any further mischief in British territory, but that individuals and small bands operating from Afghanistan would continue to be difficult to control, though they would endeavour to do so. They said it was improbable other Afridi clans would be induced by Afghan emissaries to rise, but that even if they did Zakka Khel would endeavour to remain apart and guard Bazar. Copies of a new Jehad firman with the Amirs seal have recently reached Tirah in considerable number. Political Agent, Khyber, has succeeded in getting&apos;a copy, which I am sending you to-day. Text is different from that of any I have seen before and tone is very violent. It is undated, but from internal evidence purports to have issued on 12th May, though Mullahs and others who have brought it to Tirah say that it is quite a recent production, and is designed to reassure Afridis against rumours circulated by British that Amir had asked for peace. It is certain no messages have been received by Afridis from Afghan officials informing them of armistice negotiations ; on the contrary, Afghan emissaries in Tirah are contradicting vehemently all peace rumours and Jehad preaching is very active and is increasing. Collections of tribesmen between Hazarnao and Jalalabad are becoming discontented at the scanty supplies they are receiving from Shahgass, Muhammed, and it is probable that they will break up. At Charsadda last night a powerful bomb was thrown at Assistant Commissioner Wyllie and Superintendent of. Police Foster while dining. Neither was hurt, but both had very narrow escapes, as bomb exploded in soft earth of garden within a few yards of them. A cavalry force drove borders of Khajuri Plain early this morning; full report not received, but drive appears to have been successful, and many outlaws and deserters captured. Reilly reports from Mirkani, 20th June, 12 hours, that General Wakil Khan, who has recently arrived at Asmar, has brought with him 1,000 infantry and 200 cavalry, all well armed. Wakil Khan is a converted Kafir, and it is believed that he intends to move against Bashgal Kafirs. Unconfirmed report received that Kafirs of Ramgal Viran and Wargal valleys have revolted against Afghans, and Lutdih Shakgalis have joined Kamdeshas in refusing to send jirgas to Afghans. A Kafir Ghozbacha, who has arrived at Lutdih from Kabul, lias spread stories that Ulya Hazrat has gone to Balkh and that it is believed that Amanulla may follow her there. He has told Kafirs that our aeroplanes have completely destroyed Jalalabad and destroyed most of Kabul Arsenal, killing there some of AmanuhVs servants and horses. Donald reports Orakzai quiet. Mullahs preaching that Amir will shortly resume hostilities. Political Agent, Toehi, has received, letter from General Nadir Khan, protesting against punishment of Wazirs and Daurs of Toehi Agency and asking for a reply. As punishment is confined strictly to deductions from Tochi Agency within demarcated Durand line, I recommend no answer should be sent to Nadir Khan, whose protest is a gratuitous impertinence. In all other districts and Agencies everything reported to be quiet.&quot;Following from Dobbs, 21st June : &quot; Quiet prevails everywhere in Baluchistan. I am continually receiving most reassuring and loyal messages from Marri and Bugti Sardars and Jogezai Sardars (corrupt group) Saifulla have been active quieting Zhob tribesmen and contradicting mischievous rumours.
