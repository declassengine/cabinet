Under the reconstruction Regulations tho Nationality rule reads -&quot;fiandidates must be natural-born.i3ritish subjects and the children cf natural-born British subjects or natural-born subjects of an allied country provided that excoption may bo made in tho case of candidates who have served in His Majesty1 Armed forces during tho War*ffIt r/ill be observed that while this rule is in some respects wider than tho now rule, o0g,, in admitting the children of allied subjects, and in excepting candidates who have served in combatant units, its   scope is more limited than that of the hew rule in a case of mixed descent; thus, while tho old rule excluded tho child of an allen-enomy or neutral mother, suoh a person would be eligible undo/ the new rule provided, of course, that ho and his father were both natural-born British subjects,It would seem desirable and equitable (especially having regard to the state of public opinion on the question of the ex-soldier) to add the proviso as to service in the Armed Forces to the new rule.     Candidates should only he given tho benefit of tho concession provided that their service has been in the Armed forces,(b)   On the 17th January, 1919, (Y/ar Cabinet  17.) the War Cabinet approved a proposal that all action in regard to tho dismissal from Government departments of persons not wholly cf British extraction employed therein should be *suspended pending any report by Lord Justice Banlcos1 CommitUee -and any action by tho Government thero.one , The Bankos1 Committee have now reported fom&amp;o 195) and for present purposes it is assumed that all tho persons affected will heC R E T,-7533.left
left in the posts they now occupy.   The Bankee Committee did not, however, deal with persons who, while not satisfying the new rule, have in the past qualified for established post3 but have not as yet been certificated because of the Committee^ enquiry.   These persons, of course, satisfied the nationality rule in force.at the date when they qualified for establishment, and it is thought that th^ir case is difficult to distinguish from that tuf the alien-descended who have actually served in established posts.    It is accordingly suggested that they mi^ht now be certificated and employed in their established posts &quot;subject to any action which may be taken by the War Cabinet upon the Banker Committee!s Report&quot;.   This would be a warning that, if the Government should as a result of that Report, take any action to terminate the service of persons already employed, or otherwise deal with them, the new appointees will be subject to similar action.   The same procedure should be adopted in the case of any persons who have been allowed to compete under the Reconstruction Regulations but who would be ineligible under the new rule.(c)   It is assumed that in approving the new rule the Home Affairs Committee were aware of the views of the High Commissioner for South Africa and that no modification of their decision was intended in the case of annexed subjects or their children,3,   The Treasury accordingly recommend -(i) That the new nationality rule should read -&quot;A candidate must be a natural-born British subject, and the son (or daughter) of a father also a natural-bom British subject; provided that exception to the latter condition may be made in the case of candidates who have served in His Majesty1s Armed Forces during the war:(ii) that persons who, while not satisfying the new rule, have in the past qualified (under the Reconstruction Regulations or otherwise) for established posts, should now be certificated and employed in their established posts on the distinct understanding that their establishment is subject to any action which may be taken by the War Cabinet upon the Report of Lord Justice Bankes&apos; Committee;Further the Treasury assume -(iii) that it is not intended to exempt * annexed subjects&apos; from the.operation of the&apos;new rule.&quot;jreasury, S.W. .30th,June 1919.
