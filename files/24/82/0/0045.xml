SECRi T.CABINS.7545.^STION 0? ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES III CARRYING OUT PUBLIC &apos;7QRKS OTflPSR THAI&apos;? HOUSING.(Memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland.^Following on a circular issued by the Edinburgh Divisional Office of the Ministry of Labour, inviting local authorities in Scotland to press on public works with a view to the relief of unemployment a conference of local authorities was recently held to consider the matter.   Representatives wore present from Glasgow., Edinburgh, Dundee, Aberdeen, Perth, Greenock, Paisley, and other towns, as well as from several counties.   The following resoiu-tions were passed:-&quot;(l) That this conference of local authorities in Scotland in view of the large number of men and women at present un-employed and the large suns which care being paid in out-of-work donation, resolves to urge the Government to grant to local authorities such financial assistance as will enable them to overcome the present high cost of materials and labour and so allow them to proceed at ence with work of public importance and to provide useful work for those at present out of employ-ment:&quot;(2) That this conference remits to the Executive Committee with power to take all necessary steps to obtain the financial assistance required, and in that connection to approach the appropriate Government Department or Departments on the quest ion,&quot;I received on the 20th instant a deputation of the Executive Committee referred to.    It was stated that the local authorities were sympathetic with the suggested acceleration of public vorks. but that financial considerations made it difficult if not impossible to proceed with them at once; that the present cost was estimated at double the cost in 1914; and that local authorities are un^illin^ or unable to incur this increased expenditure at the present time, see in/i that, if they wait say for twelve months, they would probably be able to do the work at considerably less cost.   They also had to take into account, apart from new proposals, the iismcn^ely increased expense of maintaining the existing public services. In Glasgow it had been found necessary to obtain statutory power to raise the local rates above the existing statutory maximum.   The serious existing unemployment was it was argued due to national rather than to local causes and should be met by -*i a national provision.    Indeed this fact was already recognised by the payment from Imperial&apos; sources of out of-work donation. The conference had been of opinion that the&apos;large sums spent in the donation mirvvt be better used in subsidising local author-it ies in proceeding with useful work, and thereby providing employment.   It was suggested that grants should be made for such purposes as public health, roads, water-works, police stations, gas, electricity and tramway works, markets, parks, public halls, etc.,, and that the amount of grant should be 50% of expenditure where a contract is placed within two months,miQ DOCtBONT IS THE PROPERTY 0?

of a date to be prescribed, 40$ where it is placed within three months, and so on in a scale descending to*5$ where the contract is placed.within eight months.It was further suggested that in the circumstances a very free hand must be allowed to Ideal authorities to proceed without central supervision.In reply I pointed out to the deputation that the proposals wre very far-reaching and, if sanctioned could not be confined to Scotland.   The liability of the Treasury iR&apos;0uld be undefined, and would be additional to that which it had already undertaken for housing. Proposals for special subsidies of this kind had cone from various quarters, and had been rejected in favour of the system of out-of-work donation.   Meanwhile un-employment, according to the Labour Ministry statistics of out-of-work donation, was rapidly diminishing.   In England very few local authorities v-ere asking for such assistance, and in Scotland the conference by no means embraced the whole country.The estimated cost, of work still to be done in Scottish burghs under schemes in progress i3 stated at  825,000, and in counties  629,000.   Of the burgh total  564,000 represents work to be done in Olasgww. Fork in prospect is stated to amount to  9,000,000 in burghs and  2,700,000 in counties, the Glasgow total being  5,500,000.   It may be noted that a good many of the ^orks enumerated for assistance already receive sub-ventions from the Government, e.g., roads,police stations, sanatoria, hospitals.I should add that some criticism was passed by members of the deputation upon the figures which I quoted shewing large reductions in out-of-work donation. It was suggested that the apparent diminution did not really mean a corresponding decrease of unemployment, but in some cases, at any rate, merely pointed to the with-drawal of names from the Labour Exchanges.The attitude of the deputation was that they were anxious to assist the Government by carrying out all possible local schemes at the earliest possible date, but that they were really unable to do this unless they received financial help from the Government.As the question raised was in my judgment one of principle and   ndeed of high policy, I undertook to submit the matter to the Y&apos;ar Cabinet for the consideration and decision of my colleagues.(Signed) ROBERT MUNRO.ottish Office, 25rd June, 1919.
