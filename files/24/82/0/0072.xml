With reference to your unnumbered telegram dated 21st June.   Following has been telegraphed to General Malleson: &quot; With reference to your M.D.O. 1755, dated 10th June.   Following policy has been approved by Secretary of State : -&quot; 1. Force at your disposal is considered sufficient to deal with any probable Bolshevik or Afghan force which can at present be brought against you, provided you are able to engage them separately and in detail, and at present an Afghan-Bolshevik combination against you seems unlikely.&quot; 2; His Majesty&apos;s Government attach supreme importance to your holding on to Meshed as long as possible, and no withdrawal from there should take place except on a direct order from the Commander-in-Chief in India. Such a withdrawal is only likely to be necessary in case concerted operations in superior force are being directed against you. If forced to retire, Kain area appears to be the best location for your force to retire on.&quot; 3. Once such a retirement is begun, however, it should be carried through without hesitation and without regard to bad effect likely to be produced in Persia, and to loss of all touch with Central Asia.&quot;4. Notification to Bolshevik and- Afghan commanders, suggested in your paragraph 3, should not be made as it may merely serve to provoke, without deterring, them.&quot;
