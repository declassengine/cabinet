PEELING AMONGST SAILORS AND DEMOBILISED MSN IN TEE&apos; TOST OP ENGLAND.Admiralty Memorandum for the. War Cabinet.I think it is desirable that my colleagues in theWar Cabinet should see the following extract from a secretReport whioh has been received from Devonport as to the stateof feeling in the West of England&quot;Down this way the demobilised men are in a particularly nasty temper-      Per instance, at Truro the Comrades of tho Great War have refused to form a Guard of Honour to the Prince of Wales when he comes on Monday, and actually threaten a counter-demonstration-     The request came from the Corporation, and the men say the Corporation has treated them like dirt-    An$ on Sunday there was a big demonstration of discharged soldiers and sailors at Exeter, the principal grievance being the employment of women in Government offices.    The dis-missal of these women, as you know, would not help very much, but it is the principl e of the thing whioh annoys them, and they suspect cheap labour.     What would please them and tend to settle things for the time being would be a Government decision to get rid of all women-   And the men of H.M. Navy are just..as. indignant on this point and speak with the utmost contempt of Wrens, whom they say they have to 8knuokle under to&quot; when they go up over a question of gratuity or pension.    Some of these women, I*m afraid, do not exercise much discretion, and succeed in rubbing the sailors up the wrong way *^The unemployment is increasing^ down here, and soldiers and sailors&apos; associations growing at an alarming rate - 55000 Comrades of the War in Plymouth alone and at least six figures all ever the country according to the number on one man&apos;* s badge*fi(Signed)   W-H*L0NG
