TWs tk3oscrr-e:&apos;r: to v.c Property ct rNq cadV^v Mia Britannic MaleoWs Governmentl*VINTERNATIONAL POOD CONTROLMEMORAEDUM BY THE POOD CONTROLLERI have had under consideration a Memorandum submitted by Mr.Hoover the Supreme Economic Council on June 2nd as to the liquidation of ernational food control.Broadly, the view expressed by Mr. Hoover is that there   is no d to continue after the signature of peace, or at any rate after the ing harvest, any international arrangements for the purchase and (ltrol of foodstuffs.    It is pretty clear that America at least will h to stand out of any such arrangements and will not in any case be pared to. limit its producers1 prices, and that the utmost that could be contemplated would be the maintenance of some form of co-operation tween the various purchasing countries.    The position in regard to principal foodstuffs is as follows      *Cereals k   In the view of the Wheat Commission, it is not in interests oi this oountry to continue any international arrangements the joint purchase of cereals after the beginning Of the forthcoming [&quot;vest.    They urge that we could almost certainly obtain our supplies e cheaply if we bought for this country alone; that is to say, we fuld thereby reduce the amount of the subsidy paid to keep bread at present price,    The Treasury and the Board of Trade share in this iw and, accordingly, at the suggestion of the former, a letter has in addressed to the French and Italians formally denouncing the exist-Wheat Executive agreement as from August 51st next.   This does not, eed, settle the question finally.   The existing agreement was in any e inapplicable for the futurev and it might be possible to continue h feOrtie modified control.   In the view of all those directly concerned h the matter, however, this would be undesirable.   It is urged that utmost we should do in the event of the French and Italians taking ious objection to ending the Wheat Executive, is to inform them that shall be prepared to give them all possible help through our buying organisation throughout the world to act on their behalf as agents or kers, but that we should undertake no liability ia respect either finance or of tonnage.(2) Sugar;   The French have in effect ma4e international purchasing possible by the free import of sugar into France on private account. Italian imports are negligible.   There can, therefore, b-t.no stion of the continuance of inter-allied or international purchasing sugar.   Even if thisvjere still practicable, it is far from clear it would be advantageous.(3) Meat and Fats Executive:    This body is In a state of suspended [nation.1   It never (apart from the special arrangements for frozen t carried out by the Board of Trade) undertook joint purchases on alf of the allies, but only allocated quantities/ From the point (view of food supplies for this country, inter-allied cso-operation d only be of importance in respect of bacon, hams and lard, andthen if it included hot merely the allies but neutrals and enemies, (particular, Germany.   It is hardly possible to conceive of a joint phasing agency with Germany immediately after the peace.(4) Oil Seeds Executive:    This body has only to a relatively 1 extor.tt made purc has e s on joint account.     If It were possible to to some international arrangement for consultation as to the markets jtfhich the various countries would deal and the prices they would jsr, this might be an advantage from the point of view of this as of other   Important purchasing countries.   I very much doubt, however, her such an arrangement is practicable.   I should ad^ that there\ considerable conflict of opinion as to the state of/
of supplies in the near future.    At the present moment the supplies coming forward are less than the demand and some authorities expect this condition to continue.     The general opinion among experts, owever, is that there is a surplus of supplies in the world as a bhole and that all thfcfc is required to keep down prices here is the provision Of adequate shipping.In general, in the-opinion alike of the Commissions and Supply ranches of the Ministry actually dealing with particular foods, and of the Treasury and the Ministry of Shipping, it is distinctly contrary to the economic interests of this country to continue any arrangement for international purchasing.   The gain in keeping down prices is problematicj the loss in going into partnership with relatively weaker partners is certain.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer has expressed the strongest disapproval of any attempt to continue the financial arrangements involved in inter-allied purchasings These arrangements have proved just workable during war-time with a maximum of friction. The attempt to continue them during peace would break down and inevita-bly lead to an addition to the country1s exchange burden.There is, of course, another point of view, that of our general political relations with our present allies, from which this question jsiay be regarded.   It is urged, indeed, toy some of those who have been concerned in the working of   inter-allied arrangements in the past, that the continuance of such arrangements in future is likely to produce so many occasions for friction that on the whole we should gain rather than lose even from the point of view of our general relations to France and Italy by withdrawing from any general partnership.   I am not competent to discuss the   question, however, from that point of view,    I can, as Food Controller^ on*Vy recommend that all inter-allied arrangements for food control should be terminated other than:-(a) an offer to our allies to let them use as agents any of our existing machinery for foreign purchase, in the event of such a course proving necessary through pressure from the French and Italians.(b) an offer to enter into arrangements with allies, neutrals and enemy countries alike for previous consultation in respect of markets supplying such articles as oil-seeds, which may be in short supply.I am of opinion that, assuming America to stand out, all and more than all the economic advantages that could be gained from inter-national buying can, with more certainty, be secured for this country by effective priority of shipping, and I understand that the Shipping Controller Is in a position to ensure this if we are freed from liabilities to other countries.I ask for the decision of the Cabinet accordingly^    This should be given   promptly but should not bo given without Lord Robert Cecil, as chief British Representative on the Supreme Economic Council, having an opportunity of making any observations he may wish to make from the point of view of the Council and of the League of Nations.The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Shipping Controller concur In this Memorandum.Ministry of Pood, GS0.H.ROBERTS.19th June, 1919.
