this Document is the Prooprtv of His Britannic fWa)o3ty&apos;o G-..v-,,*nmenirmWU .... a.. ..--------------- . &apos;.....iPEIBSATIHH FOR SUBSIDENCE BILL,ft^^toiROULATED BY THE HOME SECRETARY),o,This Bill provides that in any district where ^tiiffsLqoal Government Board are of opinion that damage to,houses and buildings, tramways, reservoirs or other public works belonging to or under the oontrol of a local authority, has been caused, &apos;or is likely to be caused, by subsidence-&apos; occasioned direotly or indirectly by mining or quarrying operations, the Local Government Board shall make a.h order forming a compensation district . and establishing a compensation board.    Each board is to consist of nine members.; , two-thirds appointed by. the local authorities ooncerned, ana oriu-third by the Local Government Board.     Eaoh board is to form a compensation fund for its district,. which is.to be maintained by a general levy of such rate for every. 1,0,00 tons of mineral gotton within the district as the board may find necessary to pay claims under the Aot and to establish a reserve fund.     This levy is to bo paid as to one-half by the owner, and as to the other by the worker, of the minerals.     Compensation is to be payable not only for damage happening after, but also for damage which has happened before, the passing of the Bill.    Owners, tenants and occupiers of property damaged are,, subject to certain exceptions, to be entitled to claim compensa-tion and any person whose claim is disallowed on the ground of want of title or interest is given a right of appeal to the&apos; County Court and thence to tho High   &apos;Court.    A person is not to be debarred from claiming compensation on tho ground that he has under any deed, lease or other document or by contract or otherwise agreed,not to,^laim compensation.The Bill, which is promoted by Mr. Brace and other Miners&apos; Members of Parliament, was road a second time on the 30th May,   . With the exception of Sir F&apos;. Banbury the speakers all supported the Bill,     Sir Hamar Greenwood who spoke for the Government at the Whips&apos; request, admitted the serious -grievance which the Bill is designed to meet and raised no objection to the second reading. . At the same time he .warned the House that the Bill   would require careful examination at a subsequent stage not only as regards particular previsions such as the provision for over-riding existing contraote, but also in regard to the general question whether or not the proposed system of levying &apos; compensation,  vizs contributions to be paid by every mineral owner and lessee in the distriot, whether or no damage has been causod by the particular work-ings in which ho is Interested, or-the mineral&apos; worked in suol^a way as to prevent subsidence,^   is, in fact, the best method;   and that the whole question raised by the Bill camo within the terms&apos;of reference of the Coal Commission and ought to be considered by that Coromission.**      Mr, Justice. Sankey, who had been previously consulted, informed the Home Office that   having regard to the width of our terms of reference contained in the Coal Industry Commission Act, it is probable that the subject of the&apos; Bill is one which could be considered by us.    We have not, howover, given any special consideration to it and shall not be able &quot;to do so during the present stage of our inquiry, which is upon the principle of Nationalization, and will conolude on the 20th; June.    What our programme, if any, after thatdate will be Itdo not know. - I should like, however, to say that this question of compensa-tion for damage to property, particularly in so far as it affects miners&apos; houses, is one upon which the miners feol very bitterly, and the damage done to houses without compensation is one of their great causes of complaint.
Sir Hamar Greenwood made it clear in his speech that he was speaking for the Government and not for the Home Office, and stated that &quot;if this Bill over becomes operative, in my opinion it will become operative under the Local Government Board and not under the Home. Office.&quot;     There can be no question, I think, but that the Local Government Board, (and not the home Office), is the Department which ought to deal with this Bill and, if it is adopted, undertake the functions of the Central Authority t just as under the Brine Pumping (Compensation for Subsidence) Act, 1891, which ia th^preeedent cited in the Memorandum prefixed to the Bill,    The Bill has two main objeots (l) the protection of the small householder - and to this extent is a housing measure, and (2) the protection of local authorities.    The Royal Commission on Housing in Scotland, which went very fully into the whole subject, reported strongly in favour of legislation as essential in the interests of good housing of the working people (CD. 8731 - pages 153-158).    On the other hand, the Bill does not appear to come within the Home Offioe sphere at any point.     The jurisdiction of the Home Office in respect of mines is limited to the safety and I health conditions at the mines and does not extend to the home conditions, not has the Home Offioe at present any control over the working of minerals except in so far as that affects the safety and health of the persons employed.The Bill will of course require to be considered in its relation to the general law -\n regard to compensation for damage to property, but that aspect is a matter for the Law dfficers and not the Home Office.It is important that the question as to whioh, Department is to be responsible should be settled it an early date.    The necessary financial resolution must be moved by a Cabinet Minister before the Bill can proceed further, and Mr. Brace and his friends are pressing hard for this to be done on the first day Parliament re-assembles.     The Bill has been referred to a Standing Committee and the promotors are determined to proceed with it immediately after the Recess; but the subject ought first to bo thoroughly investigated if not by the Goal Commission, then by a Select Committee.     (Of course if the Coal Commission recommended and the Government adopted proposals for the immediate nationalization of mines and minerals the whole scheme of the Bill would obviously fall to the ground).The Home Office has already many of its own Bills, in addition to the Ways and Communications and Electricity Supply Bills, on its shoulders. The Compensation for Subsidence Bill is not a Home Offioe Bill, and we have not the time or the Staff to undertake any more extra work.21st June, 1919.E. S.
