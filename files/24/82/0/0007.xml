8$8 S. : Secret. . Afghanistan. Our telegram of 15th June, $81 S., After careful analysis of Amirs letter, we regard it as satisfactory. It evinces.a sincere desire for forgiveness of past and for a renewal of friendship.for. the futiire. It offers a basis for peace negotiations, which we can. accept with dignity, and which it would be impolitic to rebuff.   Our analysis of his letter is briefly as followsPara, 1. Is studiously courteous and shows good feeling.Para. 2. Amir makes no further atteinpt(s) to defend his aggression.   More Afghans, he replies, to warning with warning by pointing &quot;to assets on his side, viz., (a) Afghanistan^ power of resistance in spite of lack of organisation which he   \ frankly admits ; (b) tho power of call to Jehad ; (c) Afghan passion&apos; for independence ;   . [d) newly awakened world revolt against &quot;oppression and domination.&quot;Para. o. He points to difficulties.in literal compliance with armistice terms.Para: 4.-He emphasises that he has already attained, -by his orders to, his General, real object, viz., cessation of hostilities,        :Para. 5.-He waives his own suggestion for meeting of delegates .ondrentier and accepts Rawalpindi &quot; in order to secure your pleasure and to safeguard dignity and honour of illustrious British Government.&apos;&apos;Para. 6. Emphasising intensified friendship, he says, &quot;Your Excellency will see signal proof of my good intentions in my acceptance of your terms of armistice in a reasonable manner. If Your Excellency will overlook past and carefully consider, you will see a bright future for both parties in the (? fair hope of) friendly relations between the two Governments.&quot; The delegates will be prepared to start after ilamzan.Now Amir&apos;s contention is correct that he has in large measure carried out spirit of armistice terras, for he has secured a cessation of hostilities since end. of May, and has openly given orders to this end. He is silent, it is true, regarding term 4, which is to us most important, and we deal with this point speciiically in our proposed reply below.We therefore propose to accept Amirs overtures, subject to proviso indicated in our draft. We are convinced this is wisest course for the following additional reasons: (1) Prolongation of campaign is open to the very grave objection(s) detailed in our telegram 837 of 9th June. Further, this would necessitate railway through Jvhyber, which would almost certainly bring Afridis in against us and with them other tribes.(2) Further paper controversy with Amir can lead to no good result.(3) The alternative of immediate resumption of hostilities would be regarded by Moslem World after hostilities had ceased on initiation of Amir, and after Aniir&apos;s friendly letter, as wanton design on our part to prosecute the war and destroy independent Moslem State.(4) It would make any return to real friendliness with Afghanistan very difficult.(;&quot;)) We are confident that Amir now realises our strength and will be grateful to us for forgiveness and saving his face before his people, and that consequently his delegates, who appear to have been chosen for their friendly connection with India, will be instructed to (? negotiate) in spirit of trust and friendliness.   We propose, therefore, to reply as follows :-&quot; After compliments. I&apos;am glad to receive your friendly letter. You say, &apos; Your Excellency will see signal proof of my good intentions in my acceptance of your terms of armistice in a reasonable manner &apos; : at the same time you have difficulty in carrying out the first and third terms literally. My friend, I appreciate those difficulties. But as regards first term, all I demanded was the removal of your regular troops from the frontier to a distance of 20 miles from the nearest British force. As regards villages and tribesmen, I did not ask you to move them from their homes, but I must ask you to issue orders against any gatherings of such tribesmen in the vicinity of our camps. Should gatherings occur threatening our forces, I have&apos;authorised my Generals?
1 %to take the necessary steps to disperse them. As regards third term, I have understood what you say regarding your difficulties. But my aeroplanes must continue to reconnoitre in order to be secure against such gatherings, and I look to you to issue strict warning to your people against molesting them, and 1 believe&apos; your orders will be effective. - If they are molested they will retaliate. You do not mention fourth term. From this L assume&apos; you agree and have done what is necessary. If not, 1 must ask you to do so without delay. You must understand it is impossible to leave tribes in a stale of doubt and excitement at a time when peace negotiations between us are pending; and it is with you &apos; who have excited them and are their co-religionist to warn them on lines laid down.&apos;&apos; &quot; On the understanding you do this, I shall be glad to issue orders for reception of your delegates at Rawalpindi.&quot; 1 have appointed Sir Hamilton Grant, the Foreign. Secretary, Government of India, to be Chief of British Delegation. I shall intimate names of the other members to be appointed by me in due course.. &quot;I on my part also look forward, please God, to a bright future in the re-establishment of friendly relations between two Governments.&quot;will realise extreme importance of earliest possible reply to Amir.
