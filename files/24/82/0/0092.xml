V   . 332FIDTTfTIAL,TRADE MASKS BILL.iThe proposals contained in this Eill may he bricf-ffe ly summarised under three heads:-1.   Proposals having for their object the provision of facilities for the registration in the Itnitcd Kingdom of Marks which although not registerable under Jauscs l-5ft     existing legislation are nevertheless common law Harks and could be protected in the form of action known as a &quot;passing off action&quot;.2,   Proposals having for their object the prevention of the abuse of the word Marks ;   such abuse consist-ing in the use by the Trade Mark owner of his word Harks not for its proper purpose of diatinguisuing the iauge 6.        goods of the Trade Hark owner from the goods of other persons, but for the purpose of giving a name to an Article; and thus under the protection of the Trade Hark law obtaining in fact a perpetual monopoly of the manufacture of the article.3lauscs 7&quot;lfl,      3o   Minor amendments to tho- principal Act.The existing Trade Hark Act defines in Section the necessary characteristics of a registrable Trade Hark, and the limitations placed by this Section on registration necessarily exclude a large number of Marks which are and will continue to be actually used in Trade and Commerce,,      Such Trade Harks so far as they in fact indicate a definite proprcitor-ship would be protected by the Common Law; and it will be a considerable advantage to the Trading Community to have these Marks collected and properly classified.        Under the proposed amendment though they will not have the special remedies accorded to Trade Marks under Section 9 of the Old Act, they will be considered as registered Marks,, and the reg-istratiorl will be regarded as prima facie evidence of ownership.   Apart -&quot;from this advantage the propos-al will, it is hoped/ facilitate registration of1 Britigh Harks in foreign Countries.Host foreign countries require as a condition of registration in their country that any person who is not a subject of their State shall as a condition precedent to registration prove that they have obtain-ed registration in their country of origin.Many very valuable marks which are in fact dis- -tinctive of a particular trader&apos;s goods cannot at present be registered as Trade Marks in the United Kingdom, as already pointed out. and cannot therefore be registered as Trade Marks by British subjects in foriegn countries.In the
/In the case of many such Harks, traders abroad (frequently traders of Gexraan origin) have actually registered suoh I-larks in foreign countries as their own Trade Maries, and have used them to, pas c; off their own coods as the  oods of the British Trader; they have even endeavoured by means of such re Istration to restrain the importation of British goods bearin^ the rarks of the true British proprietor who was responsible In the past for their creation and value.In Clauses 1 to 5 of the an attempt has beenmade to frame a complete scheme for the registration of such common law Trade Marks,Clause 1 provides that for this purpose a now part of the&quot;Trade Mark Register, to be known as part B, shall be opened wherein such Marks shall be registered.^lause^ 2 provides for the re istration of all such Harks which ITave been bona fide used in the united Kingdom for a period of not less than one year.     It is not intended that the parent  Office should undertake any search in respect of these marks, but power is reeerved to refuse re ;istration of -any&quot; I.?ark , vhich in the opinion of the Re-istrar should not be registered,     An appeal isprovided from the :ie^istrar&apos;s decision to the Court,j-Clause o applies certain provisions of the principal Act to the Harks rc-isterable under this Act.      These provisions are necessary to pro-vide machinery for opposition: and other proceedings before the Patent Office,Clause 4 provides that the entry of a mark in part&quot;B of the Register shall not be conclusive evidence that the pwner has the e::conclusion ive rif;ht to the use of the I ar&amp; but only prima facie evidence, and the only powers that the owner of such a Lark will have in the United Kingdom will be such powers as he would have had in a pas^ins off action, except that the onus of proving that the Hark has not been infringed has been placed upon the defendant.Clause J5 allows the Registrar when he is con-side rinV^an application to re ister a mark under part A of the Re ister and is of opinion that such appiica-tion should be refused, instead   of absolutely refusing to register the Park under part A of the register,,, to treat it as an application under part B and proceed accordingly.These
Clause 7 transfers from the Board of Trade and the Court to the Registrar the power to determine the distinctiveness of marks other than those referred to in paragraphs 1 to 4 of Sec-tion 9 of the Trade Marks Act. 1905,   &quot;Hitherto the Registrar has only been permitted to consider the distinctivencss of marks coming within the categories mentioned   in paragraphs 1 to 4 of the Section.     There i3 no reason why he should not be empowered to deal with all oases.    The change will simplify and cheapen the procedure.
Vnablc British Trade Hark owners to obt^ii-jp^wboctixyxv-for their Harks in foreign countries and &quot;-ill at tho same time-be 0 more or loss complete record of mar$&amp; in use in the United kingdom.     As regards cornmor-mlaw Hark.ft so registered in part B subetantially no greater rights in the United Kingdom will be acquired by registration than are at pres-ent capable of being enforced in a passing off action.Clause 6 is framed with the object of remedying the abuse of the Trade &quot;ark law referred to under the Second head above.The proper function of a Trade Hark is to indicate that the goods UDor. which it is used are the goods of a certain Tnder by virtue of -manufacture. Selection, Sole, &amp;c.      The name by which an article is commonly known -without any reference to its origin is not a proper regist-r^blc Tra.de Mark and the Courts have on many occasions r-moved such Marks from the Registor*     The evils rosul-tir.g from the possession of any monopoly in the rm ac of article, have been most cohspieuojue- in the case of drugs, and in particular drugs which,        originally protected by a patent.     It is a well- teftwn principle of law that tuc naae&apos; of a patented article cannot be protected as a Trade Hark.     Otherwise the rights -Of the public to manu-facture the article after fourteen years might be practi-cally destroyed, if they were unable to use the name by which alone t.;j.e patented article has been known and sold, A very good example of this abuse is the word &quot;Aspirin&quot;. This word &apos;&quot;a.s registered as a Trade Mark for a drug.   The owners of the \lark instead of using the word legitimately as a Trade Hark, vis,, as indicating a drug cf the manu-facturr- of a particular firm, have consistently sought to use the ^ord as the name of the article, and under the garb of a Trade 3lark, to obtain in fact a perpetual monopoly of the manufacture of the article.The Clause deals only with the more conspicuous cxanplcs of the abuse described, vizc the use of the name of a patented article as a Trade Hark after the expiration of the patent, and the use as a Trade Hark of the name or only practical description of a single chema ical substance.%Clause IK transfers the right of appeal in matters which involve legal interpretation of the Acts from the Board of Trade to the Court.     Under the oresent law t --rre is in the case of oppositions and other matters a dual jurisdiction on appeal which has obvious dieadvan-tages.     It is thought that all such appeals should be made to the Court, except appeals on unopoosed appli-cations.     It further gives the Court power to exercise the s-imc discretion m dealing with cases as is now ex-ercised by the Registrar.    Dissatisfaction has been . caused in recent years by the fact that on appeal from the Registrar the Court has in certain cases avoided a direct decision on the merits, and has rejected amocals on the ground, that the Registrar has exercised a discretion which should not be interfered with.     It seems better to give the Court the fullest power of revision and appeals l^uscLJ!! gives to the Registrar an original Juris-diction to  rectify the Register which he has not with-erto enjoyed, but which it is thought is desirable.   This will enable any Marks which have bcased to be use^ to be removed from the Register.    Many such Harks re-iain on the Resistor at oresent owing to the unwillingness of traders to incur the expense of applying ef to the Court to remove thenu
