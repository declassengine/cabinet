The Teat her and Condition of Crops .In tho Southern and Eastern Counting tho drought was broken on Friday &quot;by a steady downpour of rain which continued for about twelve hours.     Tho weather in Tales has been unsettled, but in the Midlands and tho North there have been a few light showers only, and the crops are suffering severely from the drought,Haymaking has been continued throughout the oountry; meadow hay is everywhere light and short, but in some districts the crops of seed hay are fairly good.Roots and spring corn have suffered from the drought and the corn crop generaly will V; short in the straw.     Fruit has benefited by the rain in the South and JUast, but mure rain is still required bofore an increase in the raspberry crop will result and tho &quot;premature gall of plums and apples is checked,     ffu. :,hor damage by caterpillars is reported from Northampton and Leicester.Land Division.(i)   Land Settlementions,.,for^Small.H^ldin^s.

Returns have new been received from 47 County^CouncTls showing that&quot;of 16 ,96a applicants fer small holdings 6.714 ha-ve been interviewed.     Of thrf&quot;numVr interviewed 5^221 (or 7S^) have been approved.     The approved applicants comprise,4,648 who require small holdings amounting to 97J??]? acres 575 who require cottage holdings amounting to 1/,000-h acres.I       Land Settlement through County Councils,     Owing to the difficulty of obtaining Vacant possession and of erecting dwelling houses and build?ngs, the number of applicants actually provided with holdings-is necessarily still small.     The number cf ex-Service men actually
settled on the land by County Councils up to the present 1b 466, the ^holdings provided comprising 6,451 acres.    This number, however, includes old tenants of the Councils who have returned after serving in the active forces-In addition to the; above, county officers arr- frequently in a position to assist applicants to secure holdings owned by private; land ovmers.    For example, the Board have received during the week particulars of 11 applicants, of.whom 6 are ex-service men, who have be*;n provided through the agency of the County Council with privately-owned small holdings in Radnorshire, the holdings comprising 134 acrta. il*o complete record is, however, available of the number of such men settled on privately owned small holdings.During the week the following purchases of land by County Councils under the Small Holdings and Allotments Act, 1908, mainly for providing holdings for ex-service men, were approved by the Board:-County. .

An Order for the compulsory hiring cf this land was confirmed by the Board on the 27th March, 1918.The total area of land acquired cr agreed to be acquired by county Councils since tho 20th December, 1916, with the Board&apos;s approval is 33,225 acres, of which 30,905 atree am in England and 2,320 acres in -UI03.

Of this total 95,534 acres are in England and 8,926 acre-s in -Vales.Q^^^^II^X^^LB.*     The Board have received notice of the following Orders made by County Councils for the compulsory purchase of land:-County.

The of fern received direct &quot;by the Beard in response tc the President&apos;s appeal to landownera for land suitable fcr small holdings number 196 comprising approximately 38,000 acres.     These are being dealt with as indioated below:-Acre 8.Declined without inspection   41 offers representing 395Declined after inspection      72      &quot; &quot;        &quot; 13,595Further particulars awaited   33      &quot; &quot; 7,934Referred to Commissionersfor inspection 23      M &quot; 7,970Referred by commissioners to County Councils asprima facie suitable 14      &quot; M 1,633Declined by County Councils     7      &quot; &quot; 1,797Withdrawn v6;.     &quot; &quot; .,5 ,,091196^ 33^465SBOLSettlement s,admi niatered &quot;by the Board .     The nego t i at ions for the acquisition of the two additional farm Settlements referred to in last week&apos;a report have now been concluded and further particulars of these estates can be given.     The first, situated at Berwick St. James La the County of Wiltshire, comprises 1,520 acres. It is about seven miles north-west of Salisbury, and six miles from the Amecbury farm Settlement.     It includes the village of Berwick St. James.     The price to be paid for the property is  25,000 and ^-possession will be obtained at Michaelmas next.The other Settlement is situated about 1 mile from Wantage and comprises 1,000 acres which will be purchased for the sum of  23,000.     During the present week negotiations have been concluded
T*t&apos;h another owner for the purchase of an adjoining property known a&amp; &quot;The Red House&quot; comprising about 65 acres of land, including some farm buildings,for the sum of  1,200*     The acquisition of this property was necessary because part of the main property was dependent on water supplied from a well on Red House Farm, and the rights were previously held on an annual agreement only.During the week a further estate has been acquired.     It was part of the Titchfield &quot;1state, situated near Swanwick in the strawberry growing district of Hampshire, midway between Southampton and Portsmouth.     The property comprises about 1,355 acres, and the price to be paid is  55,000.     Over 330 acres are already devoted to the growth of strawberries, and a considerable part of the remaining area can be similarly utilised.In addition land adjoining the Heath Hill 3?arm Settlement has be&apos;n purchased by auction for  3,650.     The piaporiy comprises 51 acres and include s one farmhouse, two cottages and one set of farm buildings. TVTo ..    mother cottages adjoining havo also been obtained by private treaty for  230.     Theso additions to the Hoat;Ii;.LKllI Settlement will facilitate the development of the property, as the house, cottages and buildings can be utilised both to serve the new land and some of th/ land already acquired.     Their acquisition will also reduce the cost cf adaptation of the existing Settlement, as the buildings have been acquired at a much lower coot than that cf new buildings.As scon as Treasury sanction has been obtained the above purchases will be completed, and will bring the number of Parm Settlements up to eleven, comprising in all 16,003 acres.The number of e::-service men at the Settlements is now 166, an additional 7 men having commenced work during the week.     60 m*.n have been accepted as settlers, 91 have commenced work as probationers, and 17 cth;.r e:-:-Service men are employed as wage-earners. 19 addition&apos;:! men have been accepted as probationers, but have not started work up to the pre sent time.The crops at Heath -Kill ap-oear to have suffered very much from the continued drought-and it is fear-d that the     .yield will bo much below that cf last year.     Lost of the small-holders who entered  ., on their holdings at Lady Day are making satisfactory progress and seem v. ry content with thir holdings.     One cf the most gratifying features ol the- Settlement is that the small-holders appear tc seek the assistance t;f the Director, both as to the management cf their land and also in the. selection and purchase1 of live-stock.     Some of them are taking advantage of the 7ar Department Scheme for tho loan of horses and muli s.     The fruit tre-s and bushes planted out this Spring look to11 and the nursery on the Central Parn is well stocked with young tr^cs. ,The weekly reports received from the- Directors show that at all thi; settleia-nts field work is going on satisfactorily, but at ncn   of the Settlements has much rain fallen.     At Hcath_EA.ll the drought has be.-n broken by three local showers which have just saved. t)n  o-t crops from total failure:, tho rainfall, measuring about half an inch.     At the othrr Colonies only light showers have fallen.     At .HcJ.beajch 40 acres of seeds have been cut- and carrying has commenced. y itionol stock is being obtained for the pombroy Settlement, as there is plenty of grass cn the marsh fields.     Unfortunately, fluke- has developed among tho flock at this Settlement and. some fifty sheep are sL footed, fifteen having died.     A veterinary surgeon has been called in  ,nd the affected sheep have been isolated.     At Heath Hi 11 two a iffrs have been sold to the sottie rs during the week, and at l&apos;-&quot;-trinetcn. 21 ni^s.
In February 1910 the &quot;rest Sussex A.E.C took possession of a farm of about 112 acres on the Coulhurst Estate which was in a notoriously neglected condition.     The tenancy of the land was not determined at the time of taking possession, but recently the Committee ask-d the Bo \rd to make an order determining the tenancy as they were satisfi- d that the tenant would never cultivate the land properly.     The necessary order was made and th/ tenant ex.roisod his right toroquir  a ref-rence to arbitration.     The  arbitrator has iesued his Award which supports the Committee&apos;b decision.The Ho 11 i n&quot;;hans hi re A.:*.C. were givt n authority to prosecute th- occupiers of a farm at Bawtry for refusing to relinquish possession after th- ir tenancy had been terminated under Regulation 2K, on account of the deplorable stat-  of the farm,     Under threat of proceedings being taken, the tenants have now given complete possession to the incoming tenant.Prosecution.     An occupier in Devonshire has been fined  10 and 2 guineas costs for refusing to give up possession of an empty cottage and SQpav farm buildings on a farm of which possession was taken by the Exeoutive Committee last November.(.111)   Land Drainage.0us( Dr^in-.- Sch-me .    Of the  33,000 grant from th?&apos; Development Eund &apos;r20 ,000 has been e laid out on four dredgers and a tug for use as a t&apos;-nds-r.     CetOn .oi the dredgers is exp-\ ctefi to arrive at King1 s Lynn n*.xt week and will be employed at once to cut a channel through th^  shoal at th. mouth of the river.     The constructors of a new ship-yard at 7est Lynn have agreed to take the spoil..The oth-r three dredgers on order are Priestman steam grab crane dredgers, and are constructed with detachable pontoons, so that thy can ultinntrly be used anywhere on the Ouse system.     For the or. sent th&apos;&quot;y will be employed on the portion of the Ouse. known as the Ten Liilo liv;,r, from Denver Sluice upwards.     The first is due to bo deliver d on July 31st, and th&quot; other two in September .i5.um Cultivation of Land.     The North Riding A.E.C. tookpossession of a 34 acre farm In August&apos; 1913,     The occupying owners, who-^-\I had neglected the farm, ,had &quot;been called up for Military Servioe , and&quot; there was no one in occupation. The Committee 1.1 the eatage of the grass, and saved th hay crop, and after paying expenses a balanoe of about  104 was left in their hands. The farm has now betn sold to a very good farmer, and the Committee have withdrawn from possession.Determination of Tenancies.     At the request of the Soke of CUPe t e r b o r ou ,.-;h, a he Board issued an order determining the tenancy of about 15 acres of land at Helpston held from the Trustees of aneiAlmshouse Trust.     The occupiers appealed to arbitration, and the arbitrators finding is that the land has net been cultivated according to the rules of good husbandry, but that the faot that the occupying tenant had been on Military Service since September 1916 should be taken into consideration, and that on this account tho determination order should not take effect.
Preliminary survey a have &quot;been made &quot;by the Board&apos;0 Land Drainage staff, and 17 men are at present eimoloyed on the tree-felling and hush-trimming which are necessary &quot;before the dredgers oan get to work;   the landlords concerned have   agre.d to this being done.     it will ultimately be necessary to employ about 100 men on removal of cesses and so on by hand in order to enable the dredgers to work; and arrangements for the accommodation and feeding of the men are nearing completion.    The supply of labour in Test Norfolk being scanty, tho men required will be obtained from tho Norwich Employment &quot;Exchange, where they are available as soon as arrangements can bo made for their reception.The work that will be done this summer should go far to   &apos; prevent repetition of the serious floods of last winter, and the expenses will, it is hoped, be recoverable from the new Ouse Drainage Beard when formed.Ouse Drainage Board.     The preparation of a draft Order ccn-stituting a drainage board for the whole of the area injured by the state of this river and its tributaries has been a work of some complexity;   it has now been carried out and the draft v/ill be circulated to the County Councils and the drainage authorities ooncerned. Tho proposed area extends into the nine Counties of Norfolk, Test Suffolk, the Isle of Tly, Cambridge, Huntingdon, Bedford, Hertford, Buckingham and Northampton, and copies of the map on the 1&quot; soale have been prepared for transmission to the Councils Of these Counties * As soon as maps en the 6&quot; scale have been prepared showing the precise boundaries and divisions of the area field by&quot; field, the draft Order will be deposited for the statutory period and will bo open to the receipt of objections.Tork in flssex.

( i 7)     Tithe,, Commons, Copyhold and Survey.During tho week, 36 applications affecting 25-54 tithe rent-charge were received, as compared with three applications ---afTecting  9 tithe reirtcharge in the corresponding week last year, and 13 applications affecting  29 tithe rentcharge in the corresponding week of the month cf June immediately preceding the outbreak of Var.Not only are the redemption applications more numerous, but they each involve more correspondence than under the eld procedure . For instance, one of the deductions which the Beard are required to make under the tithe Act, 1918, in arriving at the net value of tithe rentcharge is the amount of land tax paid or payable in res-pect of the tithe rentcharge during the past three years.     Section 12 of the Finance Act, 1898, provides that, where the titheowners total income does not exceed .2160, tho land tax, which otherwise would be payable in respect of his tithe rontoharge, is not to be collected, and if his total income exceeds  160 but does not exceed  400, half of the amount of land, tax which otherwise would be pay-able is not to be collected.     The Board aro advised that in making their calculation for the purposes cf the Tithe Act, 1918, they should deduct the.average amount actually collected cr collectable and not the amount assessed.    Particulars cf the amounts assessed are, however, often supplied to the Beard in error, notwithstanding explicit instructions to the contrary, and considerable corres-pondence is necessary before accurate figures can be obtained.Commercial, division,Equipment of Small, Holdings.    Negotiations are proceeding with County Councils generally with regard to the appointment of architectural-tects for the small holdings work.     The tendency of Councils seems to be to economise unduly on salaries of their architects, but to err on the side cf undue expenditure in tho accommodation provided. It is being pointed out to them that it is false economy to attempt to secure an architect at say  200 a year when he will have the responsibility of spending perhaps  30,000 a year.     There is also the tendency to throw the whole of the work of designing and super-intendence upon County Land Agents, who are already overburdened and, moreover , sometimes have somewhat imperfect architectural qualifi-cations.    Generally speaking, however, Councils arc accepting the recommendations of the Board.AnglesoxS^^Z,JlPyiVLSlil,-&apos; ^ne Superintending Architect for Wales attended a meeting cf ^he Small Holdings Committee, who took his advice as to the selection of the architect and also of the bu:&apos;.lder who wa:j to bo appointed afl Works Manager, The Board has sanctioned direct administration of works in this County as it seems unlikely that satisfactory, .or indeed any, tenders would be obtained from local builders.Flint County Council.      The Superintending Architect ha a similarly interviewed the County Surveyor and has modified the plans cf four schemes in the direction of more economical and more simple buildings.     The appointment of the County Surveyor to do the small holdings wrk will be sanctined and he is      be fu mi p. lied with tw. o:mpetent architectural assistant?.Gloucester C county C unjjl,     The Chairman of the Small H:ldings cTimaittee&quot; has discussed&quot;with the Board the architectural ^arrangements and it has been decided, in ace rdance with paragraph 5 of the Board&apos;s circular of the ISth Marsh, that the B&apos;.ard&apos;s District

A very satisfactory appointment.Huntingdon J3ountjrJ3qunoi 1,     The Superintending Architect met the Clerk to the Council and the Chairman of the Small Holdings Cor/oaittea on the 19th instability, when the question of the appointment of an architect was discussed.     A proposal will very shortly come from the Committee for the consideration of the Board,County; Council.     It is understood that the Committee are averse to appointing an architect, but some plans submitted are highly unsatisfactory and have not been sanctioned. The Committee has been invited to reconsider the matter*Warwick County Council I *   An unsatisfactory appointment was made by the Committee without reference to the Board but permission was given for the officer to be employed on designing alterations to an existing building up to June 30th.     Some &apos;* plans .    submitted wsrs, however so bad that they have bean wholly rejected and the Committee has been invited to reconsider the matter,2mergej*^&apos; Hut Housing for Farm LabourersConferenoea with the Mini soB-r oa Labour and his officers have &quot;&quot;be em attended at which the Board were requested to furnish particulars as to the legalities in which additional labour would be available for farmers if housing existed.     It appears on examination that the amount of agricultural labour unemployed in England and -vales is small, and in any case the Count;.5&apos; ll^ocutive Committees have no machinery for securing such statistics as the Ministry of Labour desire,.     It would appear that the view taken by the Board, namely, that the conversion uf army huts into vemi-permanent cottages presents serious difficulties, both financial and practical, finds suppcit in other Departments.Pcrtilissrs^    The total deliveries of Sulphate of Ammonia fer agricultural purposes in the 12 months just ended has been 269,000 tons as compared with 234.. 600 in the 1917-13 season,     Ths censumption before the war was only about 60,000 tons together with
possibly 100,000 tons of Nitrate of Soda.     The consumption of Nitrate of Soda during the past season has probably been nearly 10,000 tons so that the total consumptions of nitrogenous fertilisers has been about 280,000 tons as against, say, 160,000 5 years ago, an increase of 75 per cent.In the case of Basic Slag the total deliveries have been 538,500 tons as against 500,700 tons last season,     This fertiliser has also gained enormously in popularity during the war, the estimated home ocnsumption being formerly about 280,000 tons;   the increase is thus about 90 per cent-.    Figures for superphosphate are not yet available, but owing to the high price and restriction of supplies the total consumption is net likely to show any increase as compared with 1917-18.Lime^    One of the difficulties in grinding burnt lime is the great amount of dust produced,     This makes the work very unpleasant and labour troubles arise.     The Department&apos;s iilngineer has now suggested certain alterations in the type of plant ordinarily used with a view to overcoming this objection, and several works propose to alter their plant accordingly,    Farmers muoh prefes ground burnt lime to any other type and a large sale oould be obtained if it were more easily produced.Feeding Stuffs -   The supply of feeding stuffs during the next month or&apos;two although not equal to the demand is not likely to bevery deficient.     In the autumn, home grown fodder cf all kinds will be available, rut if the barley and oat crops are below normal, the demand for foreign supplies of feeding grain in the winter is likely to increase.      In view of the brisk demand for margarine, the total supply of oil cake (which in the main is the residue from oil seeds and nuts crushed for margarine oil) ought to be fairly good, but owing to the short crops abroad, the supply of linseed cake and cotton seed oake may be considerably below normal.     This deficiency should be made up by copra, palm kernel, and other nuts and seeds which yield valuable oil cake, although this type of cake is not so popular with farmers as linseed and ootton seed.Transport -   During recent months the Board have been in eemmunicatien with the Railway i&amp;ecutive Committee regarding the conveyance of Superphosphate cf Lime in bulk in Railway Companies * waggons.    Representations had been received from the Fertilisers Manufacturers Association that certain Companies, who had hitherto carried Superphosphate in bulk in their own trucks, were refusing to do so any longer, and this was causing serious inconvenience to some important Fertiliser Manufacturers.    The bagging of Superphosphate involved extra expense for bags and labour, and certain Manufacturers had erected machinery for loading Superphosphate in bulk whioh would become useless if the attitude of the Railway Companies concerned were persisted in,     A communication has now been received from the Railway 3xeoutive Committee that &apos;in view of the Board1s representations the Railway Companies who have hitherto especially set aside vehicles for the conveyance of Superphosphate of Lime in bulk in their own waggons would continue to do so in the future, and this decision has been communicated to the Fertilisers Manufacturers Association.
iiHorticultural Mviaitn,County Organisation.Information has been received during the ireek that the Essex Agricultural Eduoation.Committee nas farmed a Horticultural Sub-Committee.     The number of County Horticultural Sub-Committees which has now heen formed is 14,Cultivation Section.Witfc. the object cf utilising the trade experience tf the members of the Horticultural Advisory Committee, the Division has appointed a Representative to serve wn the Distribution Sub-Committee-*. The Sub-Committee at a Meeting held on June 6th was informed, that questions relating to transport would be dealt with by the Division,, which, however, proposed to consult the Committee as heretofore.West cf England Farm Orchards Committee,     This&apos; Committee formed for the purpose of renovating and extending Farm Orchards in the Western Counties, held its second meeting on June 13th, Representatives, of the Board, of the Long Ashton Experiment Station, and of the Western Counties were in attendanoe.     It was agree! that a Leaflet should be prepared by the Long Ashton Experiment Station, giving infcrmaticn on the most suitable variety of apples for planting in orchards *   Arrangements were made for a Conference to be held &quot;between representatives of the Board, cf the staff at Long Ashton, and of the County Horticultural Inspectors for the purpose of extending and unifying the trials of Orchards now being carried on at Long Ashton.Sub-Committees were appointed,    (1) To disouss with West of England Nurserymen means whereby supplies of suitable varieties of vintage apples may be put on the markets   (2) To draw up a scheme for the survey of West of England Farm Orchards with the objeot of ascertaining their condition, the varieties grown, and the customs of tenure obtaining in different localities,   Arrangements were also made for bringing about a Conference between fruit growers and Cider manufacturers in order that they may discuss together questions cf prices in general, and in particular prices for graded fruit of vintage varieties.Fruit Growing at Knedlington, Asselby and Barnby. Yorks.   A considerable number of the small growers in these districts need instruction in better methods of cultivation.

The reports received tend tt show that in Kent where Lime-Sulphur Sprays have been used, there is a marked absence of disease in many of the largo plantations. thIn Cambridge, Worcester, and other areas the disoase is prevalent,&apos;   but only in a few cases has the disease Tkeen bad on the berries.Importation of Gooseberries.    The fact that the home-grown crop of Gooseberries is light made it desirable to provide facilities for the importation of this fruit.     Arrangements have, therefore, been made for the importation of Gooseberries under Licence and after inspection.    In all some 29 Licences have been granted, and of these consignments only two have proved to be diseased.Potato Blight,     A case of Blight was reported from Wales during the week,       A Press Notice was issued warning growers that Blight may very possibly prove serious during the coming mciths, and advising them to make early preparations for spraying.
Technical and Cultivation Division.Traotor Section.     During the week ended 6th June, 2346 tractors were in the hands of Committees and 1269 of these were being operated under the new Tractor Scheme.    Of the 1077 operated by Committees directly 467 were being get ready for sale leaving 610 available.     Of theBe 362 (or 59^) were in Cv*mmissitn and were idle for only z% of the time on account of bad weather.     105 tractors were idle through lack of work, 140 were under repair and three were not being worked owing to labour shortage.In England and Wales 3371 acres were ploughed and 8259 cultivated by 691 tractors giving an average of 4.9 acres and 11.9 acres respectively.    The highest average acreage was again dealt with in Anglesey where IS tractors ploughed 95 acres and cultivated 538, average 5 and 30 acres respectively.The number of tractors to be retained by Committees is approximately 1400 out of 4200.     It is to be observed that the difference between the former figure and 2346 (the number of traotors in the hands of Committees as stated above) represents the tractors which were to be withdrawn for sale afte? the 31st !iay, which day is included in this weekly report, Certain Committees may, however, find it necessary to retain some tractors for a short time for the purpose of finishing any contracts outstanding on the 31st ult.Requirements and Disposal Section.    During the week ended June 21st returns of sales were forwarded by Montgomery, Wiltshire, Warwick, Hereford, Holland, Lindsey, Kent, Sast Riding, Forth Riding, Devon, Bast Sussex, Pembroke, Carnarvon, Bedford, Gloucester, Surrey, Dorset, Flint, Oxford and Denbigh.Returns up to and including the 21st June show that the following have been disposed of:-1589 Traotors2186 Tractor Ploughs1324 tfiBcellaneoye tractor Implements1699 Binders134 Mowers and Reapers 3757 Horse Ploughs953 Drills1478 Carts and lorries 3314 Harrows and Cultivators 1729 Rollers and Presses 165 Potato Diggers93 Spraying Machines (including 70 Knapsack) 4421 flhippletrees73 TreBhing Machines81 Ford Box Vans and CarsThe cost of the above machinery and implements to the Department was  772.379. 0. 0. and  525,882. 6.   1. has been received in reepeot of the salea.     The latter sum represents over 68jg of cost and in Mnett&quot; (all expenses of sales and auctioneers&apos; fees having been deducted).     The result is gratifying in view of the fact that much of the plant sold had had very hard wear. A great deal of credit is due to officers of the Agricultural Executive Committees who have co-operated with the Department and have given valuable assistance in every way.
Up to date 526 sales have been held for which 4615 returns have been submitted.Excellent prices have been obtained during the week of which the following are -examtflas:- Fordson Tractor  820, Titan Tractor  260, Ford Oar  320, Ford Box Van  265.Horse Section. Sales of horses have continued during the week; the total number disposed of was 400, the average price obtained being  60.The beat sales were at Brecon, Honmcuth and Lampoter, where an average of over  80 was obtained while at Durham one horse made        190.   The total number of horses disposed of up to date is 6,870 and the amount realised  447,000.Steam Tackle Section. For the week ended 21st June, reijurns have been received &quot;in&quot;respect of 231 sets of tackle, and shew the following results:- ploughed 464 acres (2 acres per set), cultivated 26,869 acres &quot;(116.31 acres per set), harrowed 1, 20 acres (5a28 acres per set), mole drained 110 acres, rolled 155 acres.   Total, 28,818 implement aeros   (124.76 acres per set).The counties returning the largest acreage were Lincolnshire, iissex, Leicestershire and Oxfordshire.Education Branch.The examination of schemes of reconstruction submitted by Colleges and Local iiducation Authorities is   proceeding. Unfortunately, the majority of the latter do not appear to be taking the matter up and there can be little question that personal interviews with the Committees will be necessary. The usual enquiries as to the educational facilities available in the country continue to be received in considerable numbers and it seems likely that the capacity of the various Colleges and Institutions will not be adequate to meet the demand.The current number of the Board&apos;s Journal contains an article givin:: an account of the position of Agricultural Education and Research ui to 31st March last.As an indication of the extent to which industries are becoming alive to tho value of rosearch it may be stated here that information has reached the Branch that in at least four cases, leading workers in agricultural research have received offers of large salaries to take up commercial work.   In two oases the offer has been accepted and the loss to two Institutions in which the Board are interested is great.publications Branch.,   The number of applications for ordinary issues of^THe &quot;1 eaiTets was 330, in response to which 1760 copies were despatched.In addition, 14,550 copies of the leaflets were despatched to applicants  for supplies in bulk for distribution.Applications were received for 348 copies of the three Bound Volumes of Leaflets, and 21 copies of the pamphlet &quot;How to Manage an Allotment&quot; were sent out.The ,June issue oi the Journal was received from the Printers and distributed. &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
Ho. 47 of the &quot;Weekly Notes for Farmers&quot; was published on Thursday, June 19th,During the week, the preparation of a new (the loth) edition of the Bound Volume of Leaflets nos.. lol-200 was completed.

A man applied for a grant for training by a farmer.     It appeared, however, from his application forms that he had obtained Priority release from the Army as a skilled agriculturist for employment by the same farmer.     The Board brought this under ihe special notice of the County Committee, who subsequently refused him a training grant.
graining- in *^re try.   The ivliiiistry of labour have aslredL, the BoarcfTo undertake The&quot; training of ez-Offioers in ^Fores-try, owing to their understanding that the Interim Forest Authority are . unable to undertake such training,   Several Conferences on the subject have.taken place, and the Interim Forest Authority have now been asked by the Board to state definitely whether they are in a position to select, and pay grants to, candidates for Forestry training,   A reply from the Interim Forest Authority is expected in a few days,It seems clearly desirable that the Interim Forest Authority and not the Board should carry out these functions.2* Training of Men.   The number of men undergoing training at Centres establisKid by the Board direct or through County Agricultural Executive Committees is as followsBois Hall Tractor school, Brentwood, 78 Shippea Hill, Lakenheath, 23Corporation Farm, Bulcote, Nottingham,     39140112 men have been placed in employment on completion of training.The number of men undergoing training at Centres which are being taken over from the Ministry of pensions is, as far as is known at present, as follows:-.Green Farm Colony, Cardiff, 45Plas Llanfair, Anglesey 14Royal Gardens, Windsor, 7Turners Court, Wallingford, 1Warley Lea, Essex, 19Swindon, 22yyol&amp;irigham, Surrey, 14Penrith, 1 Bast Midlands AgriculturalCollege, Derby 3Ringwood, Hants, 9Eollesley Bay, Suffolk, 12Birmingham Parks, Birmingham, 8Chelmsford 9164Labourl Division.I)emo&quot;bilj^atJ.on.

Women&quot;a &quot;Branch.During &quot;the past week two of the Quarterly. &quot;Meetings of the Women&apos;e ^Agricultural CoraMJ-taos have been held.   Representa * tivss? from 3.5 ocurtles have attended the meetings.   The meetings provide a us^i/l opportunity for gSviug information as to the gradual fusion of bhe men&apos;-3 and woTne.nvs organisation in each county, and the present and the future.position of the Women&quot;s Agricultural Committees.It is satisfactory to notice that in many counties members of the V/one-n&apos;8 Agricultural Committee have become co-opted members of the Wo.aonIs Agricultural Education Committee. The importance of considering&apos; ertonoed facilities for the training of women in agriculture is thereby shown.At the present time the demand for land Army workers is far in excess of the supply - this applies to unskilled, as well as to skilled women.The Central V/ages Board proposes to raise the hourly rates for women&quot;s wages in July; while in many counties overtime rates for harvest will be greatly increased.   It is likely that this decision w:Ml lead to a further dislocation of labour, and make the employment of the woman worker tempfrarily mere uncertain,   (-ret-t care has been taken to prevent the Land Army from being used as substituted labour where the men labourers are on strike, though great pressure is often brought to bear on the local women officers to allow the women to be so used.Women1a Institutes.    The Essex Federation has organisedmarket avails 11 rVile county town and market towns. Neighbouring Institutes send produce,, and the stall is giving great stimulus to local producers.   This Federation has also organised Bushel Basket-making, and has received an order for a thousand from one grower.The Norfolk Agricultural Show Committee has given the Federation a stall at the County Agricultural Show to be held at Norwich next month in token of their admiration of tho work done in the villages by &quot;Women&quot;s Institutes.12 new Institutes were started last week making a total of 1,123.
PART II. - QTfflR DIVISIONS.I) Animals Pi vision ithe number Of outbreaks of Swine- Fever is again high, namely 74, the reports of suspected cases being 286.   &quot;There were 4 outbreaks of Anthrax, and 24 reports.     19 outbreaks of Sheep-Scab were reported by the Local Authorities.Only one case of Rabies has been confirmed, and that in the county of Glamorgan.     There have been 19 reports of suspected cases.Rats Orders, 1918-1919.The following Counties have appointed Officers to supervise rat destruction:-   -Vest Suffolk, Bedfordshire, Middlesex, Lind3ey Division of Lincolnshire, and Surrey.    in the caso of Surrey, the appointment is for three months on trial.In May last attention was drawn to the losses sustained by farmers through damage to grain by rats and to the prejudicial effect that the evidenoe of this destruction was likely to have on the question of guaranteed prices.    The following extract from a Report from the Superintending Rats Officer for Hampshire affords further evidence in justification of the warning given on this point to the Central Agricultural Advisory Council on the 20th of last month:-&quot;I have now had an opportunity of looking through my roports. As you are aware, I took up my appointment only in March last and some considerable time must necessarily elapse before I can cover the whole of the area of tho Local Authority.    Moreover, it should be understood ;that any figures as to the number of rats ddstroyed with which I can supply you aro those which have been given to me by the occupiers of infested premises and that I have no means of verifying them.The approximate number of rats killed since October last upon premises I have visited between the 24th March and the 18th .Tum* as furnished to me by the occupiers is 121,500.As regards damage, one occupier who claims to have killed 16,000 rats puts his loss at  1,000, another at  450 (5,000 rats killed), another at  650 (7,000 rats killed) and another at , 800 (11,000 rats killed).I hope this information will be sufficient for your purpose. You will understand that figures arc? readily available only where a bonus per rat destroyed has been offered&quot;.Application has been made by the Army Medical Department for 7,500 copies of Notes prepared by u,s for the guidance of Rat Officers for the purpose of distributing those to each Medical Officer in all the Commands.Veterinary Department.Swinn-fever material was examined in 104 reported outbreaks.    In 73 swine-fever was found to exist.Anthrax material was examined in 5 reported outbreaks.     In 4 disease; was found to exist.Anti-swine-fevor serum.     1,000 o.c. were issued for distribution.Anti-abortion vaccine.    16,050 c.c. (321 doses) were manufactured, put up in a suitable form, and despatched for use on infected farms.
Miscellaneous sneoimens.    Post mortem examinations were made on 5 specimens. &quot;Rabiesi    11 specimens have been reoeived and examined from iuopectod outbreaks.Fisheries Division.Guaranteed price for Pickled Herrings.    lull particulars of the government scheme have now been issued to the Trade, both by the Icottish Department and by this Board.    Details have already appeared in the Aberdeen Free Press.Technical Education of Boys.    This question was brought up at the ijeccftt Inspectors&apos; Conference, and, in view of the powers possessed by iho Board under Section 3 of tho Board of Agriculture and Fisheries Act, :.903, read in conjunction with Scot ion 2 of the Board of Agriculture let, 1689, it was decided that Dr. Lystor Jameson, tho Board1 s district inspector for the Thames Estuary, should approach the Beard of Education with a view to ascertaining what action they propose to take  n connection with the future technical training cf beys desirous of entering -the fishing industry.Distribution and High Prices.    This question was also raised at the Inspectors1 Conference, and it was decided that a small Conference should be held - it has been arranged for 25th June - at which certain Representatives of the Trade should be invited to meet the Secretary of \he Y.M.C.A. with a view tc enunciating a scheme for supplying outfits %p a large number of demobilised soldiers as fish hawkers.    The purpose of this scheme is to provide a supply of fish to the coastal area immediately in the roar of sea-port towns, as well as country ((istricts near midland centres.Applications for Posts in tho Fisheries, Division.    A considerable number of applicants - chiefly demobilised officers - eontinue to apply in writing or in person for posts in the Fisheries Division.    There are no vacancies at presont, but, in the scheme for re-organising the Inspectorate, there may be a number of vacancies in the near future. The list of applicants is at present a formidable one, but a great number of the applicants are unsuitable men.    On the other hand, should vacancies arise, there are some strong candidates tc fill them.Beat Building Scheme.    The Treasury have now sanctioned the lean lor which application was made tq the Development Commissioners in connection with the Board&apos;s boat-building scheme.    This scheme has now jjeen discussed with the Board1 s District Inspectors concerned, and instructions have been issued for the scheme to be made known in the irot instance.    In view, however, ef the faot that only $ beats at the most will be available during the next five or six months, it has been impressed upon tho Inspectors that, the scheme should net be allowed to \e ventilated in the press, as a large number of applications would continue tc be received, which would only lead to disappointment,.Fishery Research.    In the course of the week, the Board allocated \he grant made tc them by the Development Commis el oners for Fishery flesoarch in respect of Local Institutions as follows:-Lancashire and Iss^ern Committee ... 1,650Dove liarine Laboratory.............. 1,000Cullercoats        &quot;............. 600Liverpool University...............

Motor Loan Committee .    Tho trials of a 100 H.P. installation at Brlxham are proceeding this week.    The work of the Committee is being disorganised at the present moment by the failure of makers to deliver certain engine parts, with the result that engines aro ntt being eempl ted &quot;by promised dates.    Installations are in progress, however, at several portsj but the disarrangement is expected to result in much delay in the immediate future,General Division.flax Production Branch.Considerable improvement is noticeable in the ercp in most tf the flax Centres as thp result of the rain laBt wec-k.In Som-.-r&amp;et the rain came too late to inorease the length the straw as much of the crop was already in bloom.Good progress is being made in the construction of most of the Ifactories.The emergency scutching plant at Peterborough is n*w in full operation and fibre of excellent quality is being produced from 24 stocks.Scutchihg operations will commence this week at Glemsford (Suffolk) and veafy shortly at Tauntfcn (Somerset).Linseed has again been placed under control and the prices formerly obtainable for crushing been   are much restricted.Kelham Estate.Meadow Lands.    Up to three weeks ago a good trop of meadow hay was anticipated.    The drought, however, has prevented this and the grass has been much burnt.Arable Land.    The fields which have been farmed during the past few years, and these sown with winter crops, held cut well against the drought, but most of the other crops have suffered.    Generally speaking, the wheat looks well, and although the winter oats and winter beans have done as well as could be expected, the trops will be cn the short side.Live Stock.    The condition of this section is most satisfactory, 22 drapes and 92 sheep having been sold since the spring at good prices.    The wool clip (which contains a very large percentage of Lincoln fleeoes) has been sold at 2/3d. per   lb.Live Stock Branch.Live Stock.No * subsidised Total new Grants     No. of new Grantsduring year ended    or renewals since   or renewals annraved 31 Bt Bar. 1919* 1 April 1919. in week endedBoars 356 C5Bulls 728 195Heavy Horses 122 117

The Establishment Branch will shortly be moved from 1, Whitehall, to 4-7 Whitehall Plaoe, Dppcrtunity is also being taken to transfer the Rats Destruction tranch and part of the   General Branch to more convenient offioes in hitehall Place.     The Flax Branch is being moved from 14 Victoria ptreet to 26 Queen Anno&apos;s Gate.These mov^mv-nts of staff from one set of offioes to inother, in the absence of suitable offices in which the whole of the oard&apos;s staff can be concentrated, cause the utmost inconvenience and leriously interfere with the work of the Department as a whole.Economics Division,Statistical Branch.The appointment of Inspectors tc check claims under the Corn Toducticn Act/1917, is now in full swing, and about 240 have now been Infinitely appointed, and certificates issued to them.     Nearly all the ounty Agricultural Committees have now replied to the Board&apos;s letter nviting nomination, and lists have now been obtained for two-thirds of he counties, and the persons recommended are being communicated with.p Some 5,000 agricultural returns have been reoeived, and morefierks have been sent to the Board&apos;s premises at Newington Causeway to leal with them.
Markets Branch.g Certificates were issued for the export of 200 cattle&quot;shorthorn) to France &quot;by the Agricultural Relief of the Allies Committee, 66 coming from northern counties, 67 from south-western counties, and 6 7 from eastern counties.     Certificates were also issued for the export of 13 horses to France, 2 sheep to &apos;-v &apos; Canada, 4 cattle and 1 pig to Argentina;   also 16 Certificates for the export Of forage to Jersey.Agricultural Wages Board.An employer was prosecuted on the 19th June at Uckfield in respect of under-payment of seven workers.. In the case of A, part cf the arrears were paid up by the employer previous to the visit of the Inspector.     The defendants solicitor had previously given the undertaking to pay up any arrears which might be shown to be due to any of the workers.     During pro-eeedings, the Bench considered that in view cf this undertaking and of the faot that most of the arrears had been paid up by the employer jprevious to the Inspector&apos;e visit, they were unable to convict land the case was accordingly dismissed.In the c-ase of B, a workman had complained to the Wages Board jef underpayment.     In reply to a letter from the &apos;7ageo Boar A to the employer asking if ho was prepared to pay any arrears due, he said he would do so if the Board would inform him as to what was due.    The Bench considered that in view of the faot that no answer had been liven to the employer&apos;s letter and of the faot that all arrears had Keen pa^d to this worker previous to the Inspector&apos;s visit, they were finable to conviot and the case was accordingly dismissed.I The oases of C, D and 33 were withdrawn as they were not so strong for the prosecution as the cases already heard.I The oases of F and G vrere those of men in respect of whomjermits for Exemption, if applied for, would have been granted.     The lather of these two men said in evidence that they were well paid at 12/- a week which they had been receiving.     It was pointed out to the-jench by the prosecution that in spite of this, an offence had been lommitted.     The Bench convicted and ordered a nominal penalty af I/- in each of these oases.An employer was summoned on Saturday the 21st June at Petworth . In respect of under-payment of one workman aged 18, and also for having liven false information to the Board.    Although this man had been tarrying out all the duties of a carter, the Bench decided that he was ply a carter1s boy, and as such was to be considered an ordinary fericultural labourer .    The Bench ordered payment of , 4 arrears and Esmissed the case with costs against defendant.     The Bench also fccided that the false information was not given knowingly and dismissed this summons also,j During the week 65 cases of complaint of non-payment of theInimnm rates were received, the largest number from a single county ling 0 in the case of Devon.     02 cases were sent to Inspectors for pit;   enquiries by correspondence were made in 402 cases;   and 42 ks( s were comploted.
