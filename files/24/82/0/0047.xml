Ministers are to discuss them and if possible settle them between themselves without occupying the time of the War Cabinet.It is probable that much time would have been saved if the Minister of Pensions had comnar&amp;communicated with the First Lord and the Secretary of State for far and Air if he thought he was n&amp;t receiving adequate assistance form their Departments*4  The reason why the Admiralty have not furnished any detailed proposals as to Post-War disability pensions is that wo have not the knowledge and experience necessary to frame such proposalSo   The procedure laid down for the Committee is defective&quot;   The Minister of Pensions is trying to get from the Service Departments a scheme which his Department and it alone is in a position to frame*T/hethor Postwar disability pensions are to be on a lowor scale than War pensions or not ? it is clear that the scales must be framed with reference to the principles that have been adopted during the war period^   Tike Admiralty are not acquainted, with these principle So   They have;been dealt with by the &quot;Ministry of Pensions and revised by it from time to time*   The Admiralty have therefore no data upon which to draw up a detailed scheme. The Ministry of Pensions have all the data*If the Ministry of Pensions will draw up a draft scheme based upon their experience during the war- the Eoard of Admiralty will give it immediate consideration from the only point of view from which they can criticise it5 viz* its bearing upon rates of service pension^As regards service Pensions? so soon as the proposal for the Committee was seen? enGjiiries were made and it v^as ascertained that the recommendation of tho Soldiers and ailors Pay Coriniittee did not refer to Service Pensions? the scales of which? both for Naval Officers and Men, have been or are being  dealt with by the Cabinet in another way.(signed)   ff.
