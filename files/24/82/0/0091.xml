His Britannic Malost/a government this Document i3 the Prpperty,oj/ 0IIPATENTS  AND DiSSIGNS BILL.I circulate herewith a draft Bill to amend the Patents and Designs Aot^ 1907, together with an explanatory memorandum,Tho Bill contains provisions for the prevention of the abuse of monopoly rights and the grant of licences Provision is also made for the extension of the term of patents from fourteen to sixteen years and also for the prolongation of patents be3rond this period where it is shown that the patentee, as such, has suffered loss or damage by reason of the war,  Various other amendments which the experience gained in working- the Act, 1907, has shown to be desirable are also proposed.I should bo glad to have Cabinet sanction for the early introduction of this Bill.A.C. Geddes. 30/6/19.
JB&amp;OTTS alt) DESIGNS BILL.The experience which the BoaTdr^iT Trade bargained in administering the Patents, Designs and^^a^-ilwx^fcs (rempo*^rry  Rules) Acts, 1914 under which licences are granted to work enemy-owned patents and designs and permission given to use enemy-owned trade marks has led the Board to consider in what respects it is desirable to amend the lav; relating to patents and designs.The object of granting patents for new inventions is to benefit the trade or industry of the United Kingdom.     For this purpose it is not enough to reward.the inventor; it is also necessary to secure that new inventions be brought into commer-cial use without undue delay.     To bring a new invention into commercial use requires in many cases the co-operation of the capitalist, and the readiest way of securing this co-operation is a grant of a monopoly.     A monopoly being contrary to coamon right can only be justified by some consideration moving to the public. The consideration justifying the grant of a monopoly for a new invention is not only the disclosure to the public of informa-tion which they can use when the period of the monopoly expires, but the benefit to trade by the new invention being brought into com aerc:ial use during that periods    The public therefore are entitled to have the monopoly so framed and guarded that they are not deprived of this consideration.    The real difficulty is tc prevent the abuse of the patent monopoly iri.th.out bo res-tricting it as to deter the capitalist frpm .financing the inventor.There are therefore various conflictfhg interests to be considered.    The inventor has to be reivarded and encouraged to exercise his inventive skill?      The financier has to be induced to assist the inventor in bringing his invention into practical use, and lastly, the public have to be protected from the abuse of the monopoly and the loss of the consideration which alone justi-satisfactory the grant.    The last consideration applies especially in the case of foreign patentees, where it is particularly necessary that the monopoly given by the Crown  n the public interest should not be ,ised to the detriment of national trade or national interests the chief abuse of the pateni monopoly may be summarised as follows:- !(l)   Preventing the us0 within the Realm of the patented invention from ulterior motives *(2)   Using the patent monopoly to encourage trade abroad and to hinder trade in the Realm.i(3)   Hindering the trade in the Realm by unfairly refusing to grant licences.Clauses 1 and 2 of the Bill are an attempt to deal with the whole question and provide a complete and comprehensive scheme for the purpose of both encouraging early manufacture within the Realm and of presenting abuse of the patent monopoly. As regards Clause 1 the procedure under Section 24 of the Patents and Designs Act 1907 has been found cumbrous and expensive and has been rarely u^ed:   and as regards Section 27 the standard of comparison between British and Foreign manufacture was one which it has been found difficult to work out in practice, as the neces--1-
sary data was not Hvrc-IJbl^    r/vcthe;-.; tliPie axe c&amp;ses whore the appropriate per^lty * m Yrr?tfrxijM\. &apos; o^hcr/n- wixrt the appropr^t*c^-remedy is a compulsory liot,i:.oe and tlier-e. would seem to be no reason for not allowing the Tribunal to order either remedy in its dis-cretion.     It 1b therefore proposed in Clause 1 to replace &quot;bath the sections referred to by a single clause amalgamating the pro-oedure as far as possible for dealing with all future abuses.   It must be borne in mind that inventions may be divided roughly into two classes, namely, those which do and those which do not require for tlieir practical development the expenditure of considerable capital,   in the case of some inventions capital to the extent of over  100,000 has been expended before any return has been received by the owners of the patents.     On the other hand there are many inventions which need but little capital to procure their commer-cial use.     The new Sections are so framed that adequate discrimination -nation in this respect can be exercised by the tribunal in deter-mining whether in any particular case there has been an abuse of the patent monopoly.    Experience has shown that it is not the case that revocation of a patent in the case of   - -        abuse of a patent monopoly is always or even most frequently the best . course to adopt in the interests of the Realm. There are no doubt cases in which the only $upishment for the abuse of the patent ^none-poly should &quot;be revocation,, . ]Vutin the majority of cases the best in-terests of the country -$$jX- ^ bablyjbe served by making the grant of compulsory- licences tfce for abuses of the monopoly. Itwould frequently be to ihti koVj&amp;tage of a foreigner that a patent -even his own patent - sheul($ 3*6* revoked if it were not being forked within the Realm, in spite of such revocation he could still import the patented article from abroad and sell it at a price which would preclude iis manufacture in the United Kingdom. This would not be possible if a compulsory licence were granted preferably to a British trader and the lieencee given power to enforce the patent monopoly.   The patentee in that case fill still receive his reward in the shape of royalty and a genuine British Trade will be assisted.    In def ault of agreement tha terms of the licence will be settled by the Comptroller or Court on principles laid down in the Bill itself - and the Comptroller may call in an arbitrator if it appears desirable in any case.In the first clause (which is to be substituted for Section 27); it is proposed to provide a simple and inexpensive means of obtaining the grant of compulsory licences and the working of patented inventions.     Any abuse of his patent rights by the patentee either by failure to work or to grant licencees on reasonable terms wherever the public interests demand, or by unfair conditions imposed on the sale or use of the patented article, will render him liable to have his patent revoked or a compulsory licence granted on reasonable terms, wherever the latter appears to be the fairer or more appropriate remedy,     As compared with the provisions of Section 24, the procedure for obtaining licences has been greatly simplified, while the grounds for aoplicr:tions have been enlarged, and more clearly expressed. Application is to be made in the first instance to the Comptroller with -in appeal to the Court.     12        In the second Clause to be substituted for Sf?ction 24 of the Act of 1907, it is proposed that the patentee should be allowed to declare his patent to be a i!licence patent&quot;, and in that case any one who wishes may claim a licence under it as of ri..ht.     This is intended as an encouragement to trie commercial working of inventions and as a possible assistance to inventors who have no means of exploiting their patents themselves, or of-2-
earning into contact, with th-o-se, who v/iah to use the invention commercially.   In deflault of agreement the termB^oi4 the lioemoe^&quot;^ are to he settled by the Comptroller or--Court.   In framing this Section care has been taken that the patentee does not evade the possibility of the revocation of his patent by converting it into a &quot;licence patent&quot;.This merely repeats Section 24 (6) of the principal Act with the necessary modifications.Representations have frequently been made that the investigations made by the Patent Office as to anticipations of inventions are not sufficiently wide; in their acope and that an attempt should be made to make the search universal.    Judging from the experience in other countries who profess to make a universal search it would appear &quot;that this is an unattainable ideal, but it was felt that in. ordey,. to guard, against the grant-of invalid patents certain additional grounds of opposition might usefully be provided under 0eotion 11 of th  let of 1907 by which the granting of patents might/be oppoa$6%&apos; l*his Section provides that opposition may be ll) on the ground that theinvention has been published pri$E! %6 application in any printed document which has been publisM&amp;f^atfd(2) in the case of convention applications wh^^^^tftrcion described in the speci-fication filed in this cot&amp;t*&amp; Htj$** from that; described in the specification filed in, thi d&amp;t$try of. origin, and when th* additional matter forms the su^dct of an application made by the opponent in the interval Tsetween the leaving of the appli-cation in the foreign State   an$ ihe leaving of the application in this country.    The remaindejf of this Section is merely re-drafting consequent upon the amen^aents proposea.In this Section it is proposed to make provision for overcoming- the difficulty which has Arisen 3,n sori^e oases where the applicant has&apos; agreed in writing to assign the patent when granted to another party or Joint applicant, and refuses \o proc$$d with the application; such oases may under this section proceed at the request of the person to whom the invention has been assigned when th$ original inventor declines to carry out his agreement.In most other oountades which are signatories to the International Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, the term of a patent is longer than that in this country^.    In this country it has remained at fourteen years, and th$ period dates from the date of application and not of the grant.,  Otyier coun-trios and among tli$m wk principal Allies have frequently urged that this term shquld -11a extended, and the. request may be said to be supported by inventors generally. .It is felt th&amp;t       opportunity should now bo taken of extending the term of patents to sixteen years instead of fourteen. This extension will bring us more into conformity with other countries, and will also be a considerable compensation - if any is required - for the somewhat wider powers over patents given by Section 1, and it will go far to meet the case of those who demand that somS extension of time should be given to patents by reason of the obstacles thrown in the way of their, use and exploitation during the period of the war.j As the sowers of the Court in this respect are not clear,this clause expressly allows the Court in determining any appli-cation for extension of the term of a Patent, to take into considera tion any loss ocaasioned by the war.
! ii 11*&apos; &apos; 1 i 1315This is to meet to some extent-the .demaia^-^t^t-^exlating I       patents should receive some extension owing to loss occasioned by -       the war.     It has already been pointed out that if Clause 6 beadopted all existing patents will be extended for a period of two years and this extension can, if desired, be given without payment of any further fee.    As at present advised the Board consider that^ the operation of the two Clauses should be sufficient to meet all real cases of hardship.    Any further general extension to meet war losses Have is not a coarse which the Board are disposed to adopt, Losses have been universal in the war, to all classes and trades, and the effect of any such proposal would be to single out inventors as a special class for special treatment.    Even if each case were to be considered on ita merits the practical difficulties would be very great, owing to the&apos;.very large number of applications that would inevitably be nade*lauso Section 29, as at present tremed,, provides for the usej_   of an invention by a GoverYcment Lepbrtment on agreed terms or on*&quot;*   terms settled by the TrOf sir^v     lr.?.s c3.ause provides that if an invention which is the 6uh;; 6\i: ti u patent was recorded in a document or tried by or ob t-fb^ll of a Government Department before the dato of the patent pjjk tblp x?c:t oemmnnicated by the applicant for the patent or patentee^ ihfe;:v option may.be used for the services of the Crown free of cuj royalty or other payment to the patentee.Jlause The Courts have fotf c. ?.or  i^me felt that the issues ina9,     a patent action aro far t-GP ru.e&apos;rcu3 and that it ought, to be pos-siblc to try the real lser.fc l-^Wen the parties cheaply and expedi-tiously.     This section (\e ss?. . attempt to simplify t&amp;e trial of a patent action by confining it ;te the claim, which it is alleged has been infringed, and exclrc&quot;.;a..g other considerations or the validity of other claims?   7*- does not -.n. fxy way alter the rights *f the parties, but simplifies procedure and saves the cost.   The results to be obtained under the proposed  wctiion can only now be obtained by two trials with an inteimVfe&amp;Mte application to amende   Provision is made to give the Court power to grant relief subject to discret-ion as to costs and termsolause    ,    This section deprives the plaintiff in an action for,1Q.   infringement of the right to an account of profits.    It is an expensive procedure and damages appear to be the proper and adequate remedy.lause This section is intended to bring the law in Great,11.   Britain into greater agreement with the laws of nearly all othercountries which curtail the rights ci patentees in the case of in-ventions -relating to food f&amp;o&quot;. medicine 0    It is felt to be in the public interest that **he*.e should be the right of free use of in-ventions so far as they p;.:e utjad for the manufacture of food and medicines; but as the patent :m,y also be of   use for other pur-poses it- is proposed only to restrain manufacture or use for food or medicines,Clause Section 39 of the Act of 1907 gives the Comptroller powergig.   to award costs in certain os,ses.     Since the passing of that Actexperience has shown that it is desirable that this power should be general in all proceedings under the Act before the Comptroller. Section 39 is therefore sepailed and the new section inserted in the &quot;general&quot; part of the Act: so as to make it applicable to all pro-ceedings relating to patents and designs.
Under the present wording of Gection 41 (2) of the Aot of 1907 it night he possible for a person to use an invention secretly for a considerable period, and when his secret was dis-covered or disclosed by an employee he could obtain a valid patent if ho at oncw applied for the grant.   It is felt that this is providing him with an unfair monopoly, and it is proposed that tho protection afforded by this section should not extend to cases where the invention has been worked commercially for more than six months prior to the publication referred to therein.ause       The only check at present on the registration of designs 14. is in the case where the complete and almost identical design is *&quot;*&quot;   found upon the register.     The consequence is that a large number of worthless and unoriginal designs are registered whioh may be used to hamper trade.    The present section has been framed there-fore to give the Comptroller power to cancel.&apos;., any any design which has been published in the United Kingdom prior to the date of regie-tration.     It is further proposed to provide for the cancellation of the registration of a design where it is applied by manufacture to any article in a foreign country and is not so applied by manu-facture in the United Kingdom to such an. extent as may be reason-ably anticipated in the circumstances of the. case and within a reasonable time,llause       This clause applies the provisions of Section 29 of the 15. principal Aot as proposed to be amended by Clause 8 of this Bill to registered designs. &apos;llause       It has been held that Section 71 of the Act of 1907 16.does not make it compulsory for an assignee, of a patent or desigc to register his title in the registers at ilie Patent Office. Con-siderable difficulties have arisen from time to time both in the office and outside in View of the fact that the name of the pro-proprietor of any particular patent or design cannot be ascertained by looking at the Register.    This seotibn has been framed to make it compulsory to register any such assignment at tht&apos; Patent Office and thus secure a complete history of any legal transactions connected with the Patent.ause       This clause amends Section 75 of the Aot of 1907 by 17. definitely stating that an appeal shall lie from the Comptroller^ &apos; decision under that section to the law officer.This amendment clerely makes statutory what has been the practice for many years past.    Hitherto it has been necessary to frame the decisions given under this Section in such &amp; form as to allow an appeal to the law officer and ^he present arnmdment dues not alter the practice in any way,     y;nuse       In consequence of the decis^sns Iglyen in the Court from IT. time to time, it has been found ifcery difficult to obtain a con-viction under section 84 of the Act of 1907, where persons have held themselves out to be Patent Agents while not describing them-selves as such by using the identical words &quot;Patent Agent&quot;.   This section is not intended to injure those who are carrying on a bona fide business but whose names are not at present upon the Register of Patent Agents.   It is merely an attempt to control those persons who are really practising aB patent agents and to exclude from practice all undesirable persons.     It will have the effect of consolidating the profess?.on of Patent Agents, and placing them all under a body which can exercise disciplinary powers similar to those exercised over solicitors by the Law Society.    The clause provides that any person not at present registered but who proves
to the satisfaction of tho BoaJd of T,:ade that prior to tho 1st day of August 1917 he has been frona fide practising as a Patent Agent shall be entitled to be registered as such if he makes the proper application for that purpose.auoe       The definition of &quot;patentee&quot; i3 amended so as to 191 harmtnise with the amendment proposed in Clause 16 thus making the person whose name appears on the Register as the proprietor of a Patent tho only person entitled to deal with it.&quot; The definition of &quot;design&quot; is amended in order to bring it more into accordance with the principles of existing legal decisions.&quot;&quot;&quot;***&quot;*,***,*&apos;,*&quot;&quot;**&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;iThe schedule of the Bill contains several minor amendments ef the Act of 1907, which the experience of working that Act has shown to be desirableMany of the amendments are by way of deletion of matter which is now obsolete or merely make statutory what is at present Office practice.The amendment of Section 5 of the Aot of 1907 extends the time for leaving a complete specification after a provisional from six to nine month so    Consequential amendments are made in Sections 6 and 12. &apos; &apos;The amendment of Section 15 of the Act of 1907 gives the Comptroller power to grant a patent in lieu of a patent which has been revoked on the ground of fraud,    Hitherto it is only the Court which has had, this power; although the Comptroller could revoke the   patent on the ground that the invention had been obtained from the applicant fce cou3&amp; not grant the applicant a fresh patent in lieu of the patent revoked.Amendment to Section 19 of tjfee AclU At present all patents of addition stand or ia^l wi nthe original patent, and in the event of the original patent being revoked any patent of addition thereon is also revoked.

DRAFTof aBILLtoAmend the Patents and Designs Acts. A.p. 1919.BE it enacted by the King&apos;s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows: 5       1. Eor section twenty-seven of the Patents and Designs Provisions Act, 1907 (hereinafter referred to as the principal Act), the for the .. . . preventionfollowing section shall be substituted:  of abuse of monopoly&quot; 27. (1) Any person interested may at any time apply rights, to the comptroller alleging in the case of any patent that there 10 has been an abuse of the monopoly rights thereunder and asking for relief under this section.(2) The monopoly rights under a patent shall be deemed to have been abused in any of the following circumstances: (a) If at any time after the expiration of four years from 15 the date of the patent, the patented invention (beingone capable of being worked in the United Kingdom), is not being worked within the United Kingdom on a commercial scale, and no satisfactory reason can be given for such non-working:20 -    Provided that if an application is presented to the comptroller on this ground, and the comptroller is of opinion that the time which has elapsed since the date of the patent has by reason of the nature of the invention or for any other cause been insufficient25 to enable the invention to be worked  within theUnited Kingdon on a commercial scale, the comptroller may adjourn the application for such period as will in his opinion be sufficient for that purpose: 116-3 A 2
a.d. 1919.        (6) If the working of the invention within the UnitedKingdom on a commercial scale is being prevented or hindered by the importation from abroad of the patented article by the patentee or persons claiming under him, or by persons directly or indirectly pur- 5 chasing from, him, or by other persons against whom the patentee is not taking or has not taken any proceedings for infringement: (c) If the demand for the patented article in the UnitedKingdom is not being met to an adequate extent 10 . and on reasonable terms: id) If, by reason of the refusal of the patentee to grant a licence or licences upon reasonable terms, the trade or industry of the United Kingdom or the trade of any person or class of persons trading in the United 15 Kingdom, or the establishment of any new trade or industry in the United Kingdom, is prejudiced, and it is in the public interest that a licence or licences should be granted: (e) If any trade or industry in the United Kingdom, or any 20 person or class of persons engaged therein, is unfairly prejudiced by the conditions attached by the patentee, whether before or after the passing of this Act, to the purchase, hire, or use of the patented article, or to the using or working of the patented process:      25 Provided that for the purpose of determining whether there has been any abuse of the monopoly rights under a patent, it shall be taken that patents for new inventions are granted not only to encourage invention but to secure that new inventions shall if possible be worked on a commercial scale in the United 30 Kingdom without undue delay.(3) On being satisfied that the allegations of any applica-tion under this section are proved, the comptroller may exercise any of the following powers as he may deem expedient in the circumstances:     . 35(a) He may order the patent to be indorsed with the words &quot;licences of right&quot; and thereupon the same rules shall apply as are provided in this Act in respect of patents so indorsed, and an exercise by the comptroller of this power shall entitle every existing licensee to 40 surrender his, licence in exchange for a licence to he settled by the comptroller in like manner as if the patent had been so indorsed at the request of
the patentee; and such an order may be made not-withstanding that there may be an agreement sub-sisting which would have precluded the indorsement of the patent at the request of the patentee:(b) He may order the grant to the applicant of a licence on such terms as the comptroller may think expedient, including a term precluding, the licensee from im-porting into the United Kingdom any goods the importation of which, if made by persons other than the patentee or persons claiming under him, would be an infringement of the patent, and in such case the patentee and all licensees. for the time being shall be deemed to have mutually covenanted against such importation. A licensee under this paragraph shall be entitled to call upon the patentee to take proceedings to prevent infringe-ment of the patent, and if the patentee refuses, or neglects to do so within two months after being so called upon, the licensee may institute proceedings for infringement in his own name, making the patentee a defendant:In settling the terms of a licence under this paragraph the comptroller shall be guided as far as may be by the same considerations as are specified in section twenty-four of this Act for his guidance in settling licences under that section:(c) If the comptroller is satisfied that the invention is not being worked on an adequate commercial scale within the United Kingdom, and is such that it cannot be so worked without the expenditure of capital for the raising of which it will be necessary to rely on the patent monopoly, he . may,&apos; unless the patentee or those claiming under him will undertake to find such capital, order the grant to the applicant or any other person or to the applicant and any other person or persons jointly able and willing to provide such capital - of an exclusive licence on such terms as the comptroller may think just, but subject as hereinafter provided:(d) If the comptroller- is satisfied that the objects of this section cannot be attained by the exercise of any of the foregoing powers, he may order the patent to be revoked, either forthwith or after such reasonable,
