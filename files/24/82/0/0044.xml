(THIS B0CJK2 ;T IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT/uWIC ieAJilSTY&apos;S GOVfiRif &quot;KaT)WAR CABINET.t    O-T. 7544.\ V RURAL housing memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland,I feel bound to submit to tho War Cabinet for decision a question of principle which has arisen in * connection with the Scottish Housing Bill.     Its provi-* sions with regard to urban housing are, I think; water-tight, and are so regarded,     But with regard to rural housing, it has been represented to me from influential quarters, and indeed it has been maintained in the Scottish Grand Committee, that the provisions of the Bill will be a dead letter if the duty of providing adequate housing in rural areas is left to Local Authoritites and Public Utility Societies ,     I cm urged to place land-owners in the same position as regards the State subsidy as Public Utility Societies.     I am assured that-, if that is done, houses for farm servants and estate workers will be duly provided, but not otherwise,On the other !-and I cannot forget that a pro-vision of a similar kind was struck, out cf the Land Settlement (Facilities) Bill in the Var Cabinet at the instance of the Prime Minister himself, and that any such proposal will provoke the hostility of tho Labour and Independent Liberal parties.I must confess that this hostility appears to me to be based largely upon prejudice.     If there is no subsidy to landlords, they may he presented by local authorities with the houses which they require, their only liability being that which they incur as ratepayers contributing to the penny rate.     If, on the other hand, they receive a subsidy, they will have to put their hands in their pockets and find the balance of the cost of the necessary houses.     It is idle to suppose that under present conditions landowners can build at a profit,     On the contrary, they will in every case incur a loss.At a recent conference assembled by me in Edin-burgh, and consisting of representatives of Local -wAuthorities, the Highland and Agricultural Society, the Chamber of Agriculture and the Farm Servants&apos; Union, *an overwhelming majority favoured the principle of grants to landowners for the purpose of rural housing. The only opposition came from the Farm Servants&apos; Union.I confess I do net like the proposal.     But I do not see that in any other way the necessary houses will be built in rural Scotland.   The conditions there1arc- of course different from most parts of England, -/here the problem is manageable in respect that the houses are largely assembled in villages instead of being scattered as isolated units over large counties.I ask for a decision of the &quot;or Cabinet on the question of principle.S (Signed) ROBERT 1&apos;UMRO.Scottish Office, 23rd June, 1919.
