It may therefore be worth while to summarise the negotiations which led to last Saturday&apos;s strike.The strike was the culmination of a series of negotiations which have been proceeding since the beginning of February. On the 1st February, a fully representative meeting of the United Textile workers Association was held at Bolton, and it was resolved to adopt the proposal of the Legislative Council of the Association for a 44-hour working week, with no resulting reduction in wages, and an adjustment of piece-rates to ensure the same wages for the reduced hours this to be the united demand of all sections of cotton opera-tives. It was pointed out at the meeting that the shorter hours movement in the cotton trade was not part of the general agitation that had developed since the armistice, but the result of the initiative taken in September, 1918, when the Operative Spinners&apos; Amal-gamation passed a resolution in favour of the institution of an 8-hour day for a 5-day&apos; week to be accompanied by an increase in the standard piece-work rates in inverse ratio to the reduction in hours, so as to secure the same wages for a 40-hour week as were thenSummary.Part I.

obtained for a 55-l-hour week. In accordance with the spirit of this resolution, the cotton workers were moving, it was stated, deliberately and constitutionally towards a great and necessary reform.The proposals adopted at the meeting on the 1st February were duly submitted to the employers, and on the 17th February a conference was held in Manchester between the parties concerned, represented by the United Textile Workers&apos; Association, on behalf of the operatives, and the Master Cotton Spinners&apos;&apos; Federation and the Cotton Spinners&apos;&apos; and Manufacturers&apos; Association on behalf of the employers. At this conference, the operatives&apos; representatives pointed out that the last three years bad been profitable for the employers, last year extraordinarily so, and that the advances of wages received by operatives had been considerably less than those obtained by other workers during the war.* They further pointed out that a general movement for shorter working hours was taking place in other industries. The employers, on the other hand, while not denying the profitableness of the last three years, pointed out that over 80 per cent, of the profits had been paid away in excess profits duty and income tax, and argued that as conditions in the industry were very variable, an average of a series of years should be taken, in order to arrive at a true view of the ability of the industry to stand a rise in wages. The employers did not object to the principle of a shorter working week, but they desired time to obtain the views of their members on the matter. In accordance with this wish, it was agreed by the conference to adjourn until the 20th March, on which date the employers promised to have ready a considered reply.The conference on the 20th March, was held at Manchester, and was presided over by Mr. Percy Ashworth, President of the Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Federation. In brief, the position of the employers amounted to the rejection of the operatives&apos; demands, and the substitution of an alternative. In detail, the Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Federation stated that the employers were almost unanimously opposed to the claim for a 44-hour week, and opposed to the claim for the same wages as was thus earned for a 55l-hour week. Their alternative proposal was as follows : That, beginning on the 9th June, the working week should be reduced from 55-1 howis to 49^, allowing 9 hours&apos; work on ordinary days and A\ on Saturdays. They stated that this proposal was subject to an agreement being come to under which some re-arranged system of working be put into operation with a view to seeing what percentage, if any, of the reduced output could be recovered, and the maximum output of the machines obtained. With a view to this, they suggested that experiment should be conducted at mutually selected mills in such a way as would be fair to both sides. With regard to wages, they declined to consider the opera-tives&apos; demands, and pointed out that if the wages agreement of December, 1918 (according to which a 50 per cent, increase on list prices was granted), were not in operation, the state of the trade would warrant a substantial reduction in rates. They were aware that other industries had secured a shorter week, the contention in some of the trades being that the output would probably be maintained.  Whether this would be so in the cotton* The following figures indicate the rates paid in August, 1914, in the cotton trade, and the advances which have been given since then..

Since that date, however, the total advance over pre-war figures has not fallen far short of that in the majority of trades, and has been greater than in a considerable number. It may be worth while noting here that a reduction in hours to 48, with compensating increase in wages rates, would require an advance of nearly 30. per cent.; a reduction to 46  hours an advance of nearly 41 per cent.; and a reduction to 44 hours an advance of over 52 per cent, on list.
trade, however, was more than doubtful. They referred, in conclusion, in the event of hours being seriously reduced, to the menace of foreign competition. The reply of the Cotton Spinners&apos; and Manufacturers&apos; Associations was framed on similar lines. Similar proposals were made, and the Association added that the whole question was an inter-national one, and before working hours were greatly reduced, they should be satisfied that similar changes were taking place in competing countries. The operatives&apos; repre-sentatives requested that the conference should be adjourned to give the operatives generally the opportunity of discussing the proposals, and this was agreed to.On the 5th April a meeting of the General Council of the United Textile Workers&apos; Association, attended by representatives of every section of the operatives, was held at Bolton. It was decided to reject the employers&apos; offer, and to maintain the original demands. The question of procedure with a view to obtaining these demands was con-sidered, and the Legislative Council was empowered to negotiate with the employers, on the understanding that no definite arrangefnent should be accepted without the approval of the General Council. In the event of no agreement being reached, the question of future action to enforce the demands would be submitted to a ballot of the whole of the Federation.A joint conference, at which both parties were represented, took place in Manchester on the 10th x4.pril. . The operatives intimated that they could not accept the employers&apos; offer, and the conference adjourned until the 16th April, when, after further negotiations, it was again adjourned until the 6th May to enable both parties to review the situation. At the conference on the 5th May, the employers made an amended offer. In addi-tion to a 48-hour week, they offered an advance in wages of 15 per cent, on standard piece-price rates. Where no standard piece-price rates were in force, an equivalent advance in wages would be paid. The Textile Workers&apos; Legislative Council decided that they could not accept this offer, but agreed to place it before a general council meeting. At the meeting of the General Council of the Textile Workers&apos; Association, which was held on the 10th May, it was decided to amend their claim to one for a 46^-hour week with a 30 per cent, increase on list prices. It was further agreed to take a ballot as to (1) accepting the employers&apos; offer of a 48-hour week and 15 per cent, advance ; (2) submitting a counter-proposal for a 461-hour week with a 30 per cent, advance; (3) whether, if the employers refused to accept the operatives&apos; counter-proposal, notices to cease work should be tendered. The result of the ballot showed 267,650 in favour of the operatives&apos; proposals as against 6,347 in favour of the employers&apos; proposals. It was also stated that there was an overwhelming majority in favour of a strike to enforce their demands.A further conference took place on the 4th June, when this decision was officially announced to the employers. At this conference the employers apparently modified still further their original offer, and suggested to the operatives&apos; representatives that they should recommend their members to accept a 48-hour week and an advance of 25 per cent, in wages. The operatives replied that they could not make such a recommendation in view of the overwhelming majority in the ballot in favour of enforcing their own claims. In view of this attitude on the part of the operatives, the employers therefore did not make a definite and official offer on the lines they had tentatively suggested. The result of this conference was that negotiations had reached an impasse, and strike notices are handed in at all the mills to take effect on the 21st June. The result of the prolonged negotiations had, however, led to a considerable rapprochement between the original claim of the operatives and the original offer of the employers. The distance that separated the two parties amounted now in effect to only 1^ hours per week and 5 per cent, in wages, and hopes were still entertained that a complete settlement might be reached. The Minister of Labour therefore invited both parties t,o a conference in London to take place on the 18th June at Montagu House.At this conference the United Textile Workers&apos; Association was represented, and the Cotton Spinners&apos; and Manufacturers&apos; Association was present, but the Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Federation declined at the last moment to attend the conference, partly on the ground that Manchester was a more suitable place for the conference to be held, and partly because the operatives&apos; delegates, they alleged, had no power either to come to an agreement or recommend one to their members. It was at once agreed at the conference not to attempt to proceed with the negotiations in the absence of the Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Federation; and after some discussion it was unanimously agreed to leave the matter of securing their attendance in the hands of the Minister, requesting him to assure the Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Federation that the operatives&apos; delegates stated that they had full power to recommend a settlement, and in view of this to repeat his invitation to them to attend the conference in London on the 19th June at 3 p.m.  The Federation(C 1817) A 2
of Master Cotton Spinners failed to respond to the Ministers invitation. As a result the conference as representing the Cotton Manufacturers&apos; and Operatives&apos; Associations decided to call a joint conference at the Town Hall, Manchester, on Friday the 20th, and agreed that the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners should be invited to attend.This conference, attended by all bodies representing the employers and the operatives, met in Manchester on the 20th June, and was presided over by Mr. Percy Ashworth. No representatives of the Ministry of Labour were present. The employers first offered five points, subject to the operatives&apos; leaders recommending their acceptance : (1) Forty-eight hour working week, times of starting and stopping to be mutually arranged by a joint committee. (2) An advance of 25 per cent, on standard piece-price list rates. (3) Equivalent alteration of rate of pay in the case of those workpeople whose wages are not covered by standard piece-price lists. (4) Terms to come into operation on a mutually arranged date. (5) Terms to remain in operation without change for a period of 18 months, and on the expiration of that period one month&apos;s notice of alteration to be given on either side. Subsequently the operatives put forward two alternative proposals, which they were prepared to recommend the members to accept: (1) An advance of 25 per cent, in wages and 46-1-hour working week. (2) An advance of 30 per cent, and a 48-hour working week. Both sides rejected the alternative proposals, and the proceedings came to a sudden close, no further meeting having been considered. At the close of the conference Mr. Gee, Chairman of the United Textile Workers&apos; Association stated, on behalf of the employees, that as the employers had not accepted their alternative proposal of a 48-hour week and 30 per cent, increase in list rates, it was withdrawn, and if a strike took place it would be on the demand for a 46 f-hour week and 30 per cent, advance on list rates. A complete deadlock was thus reached, and the strike came into operation on the 23rd June.On the 24th June, however, an unexpected movement took place. In the morning a meeting of the Cotton Reconstruction Board (successor to the Cotton Control Board) was held to discuss a matter not connected with the dispute. Representatives of both sides of the dispute were present, and at the suggestion of Mr. E. F. Stockton (president of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce), Sir Herbert Dixon (the President of the Board) approached separately the representatives of the employers&apos; and the operatives. His services as mediator were accepted by both sides, and a joint conference was arranged for the afternoon. This took place at 3 o&apos;clock and lasted four hours. Sir Herbert Dixon acted as chairman when the parties were together, and repeatedly interviewed them when they sat separately. Ultimately both sides agreed to the second of the operatives&apos; proposals of 20th June (a 30 per cent, advance and a 48-hour week), together with points (3), (4) and (5) of the employers&apos; proposals of the same date, the terms to come into operation when work was resumed. It was further agreed that the mills should re-open on the 29th June, and that another conference should be held on the 25th June to discuss the question of allocating times for starting and stopping during the new working week.The sudden agreement arrived appears to have been due largely to the personal influence of Sir Herbert Dixon with both sides. He is reported particularly to have stressed the absolute necessity in the interests of the trade as a whole workpeople as well as employers of maintaining production at the 48-hour level, and agreement having been arrived at over this point, it was only a section of the Federation of Master Spinners who happened to be in a position to face a strike with equanimity that made any difficulty over the 5 per cent, difference in wages.It was generally expected that the agreement would be endorsed by the organisations concerned, but the latest reports show that the Spinners&apos; Amalgamation has refused to accept the settlement and is calling a special meeting to discuss the matter. This develop-ment is of some interest in view of the contention as to the powers of the operatives&apos; delegates made by the Federation, as quoted above and the reply given by the operatives to it; but it does not appear likely that anything? very serious will come of it.
Part; II. Demobilisation and Resettlement.Port Labour.In this report for the 12th March, some account was given of the steps taken by the -Ministry of Labour to deal firstly with, the application of the out-of-work donation scheme to port labour in order to cope with the special difficulties arising from the casual nature of this employment, and secondly with the development of more permanent schemes, based largely on pre-war experience, for the decasualisation of port labour. It is now possible to summarise the progress which has been made in these directions.These schemes for the application of the out-of-work donation and for the decasualisa-tion of labour have been drawn up in close consultation with, and are largely carried into operation by, the Port Labour Committees, which are composed equally of representatives of employers and employed in the docks concerned. The utility of the existing Committees in the regulation of port labour has led, since&apos; March, to some further extension of the system., New Port Labour Committees have been set up, or are in process of formation, at five ports Bo&apos;ness, Grangemouth, Goole, Harwich and Dartmouth.Since March new schemes for the application of the out-of-work donation have been put in operation, or are about to be adopted, in seventeen ports, raising the total to about thirty-five. In a number of the smaller ports, as, for example, Barrow, Barry, Leven, and Maryport, it has been decided after inquiry that it is not necessary to take such measures as are required in the larger centres. In general, the schemes adopted have followed closely on the lines of the model scheme laid down by the department for the guidance of the Port Labour Committees. The necessary proof that the applicant for out-of-work donation is not employed and is genuinely seeking employment, is naturally most easily obtained in ports where a system of registration of the workers, and of surplus stands to act as a daily clearing house for unemployed labour, has been brought into existence in connection with schemes for the decasualisation of labour. Where this is not the case, the general principle followed has been to set up emergency surplus stands in close communication with the taking-on stations and to require attendance by the applicant at these stations after each call for labour, in order to furnish the necessary evidence that the man has attempted without success to obtain work. Some difficulty has been met with, in the institution of these schemes by reason of the financial outlay involved in the setting up of these premises. Treasury sanction has now, however, been obtained for the general acquisition by the Office of Works of the necessary premises at a rent not exceeding  20 per week in any one case. This authority, which expires at the end of the present year, has allowed more rapid progress to be made. In the case of the Port of London, which, was the subject of special investigation by a Committee set up under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Roche, it has been found that the cost of the premises for the special offices recommended by the Committee would be disproportionately-disproportionately high, since the number of. men claiming out-of-work donation as transport workers stands only at about 2,000. Action on the recommendations of Mr. Justice Roche&apos;s Committee has therefore been suspended, pending a systematic scrutiny of the applicants&apos; policies by the Port Labour Committee. It is anticipated that a large propor-tion will prove not to be bond fide transport workers, and that in view of the consequent establishment of the fact that unemployment among regular workers in the Port of London is not extensive, it will not be necessary to incur the expense of these special offices.In general, the schemes in operation under the Port Labour Committees are working successfully, and considerable care is shown in the administration of the out-of-work donation system. Thus, for example, in the docks at Grimsby and Hull, daily returns of labour demands are made by the employers and scrutinised by the Port Labour Committee. Applicants for donation, in addition to signing the policy in the usual manner, are required to satisfy the Committee that they have made every reasonable effort to secure employ-ment. At Bristol, again, an arrangement has been sanctioned whereby, instead of signing the policy for donation after each call, the applicant signs only once daily and in addition is called on to produce a certificate signed, as regards the Avonmouth docks, by the Port Labour Inspector, and at the Bristol docks by an official of the men&apos;s union. An additional safeguard has thus been introduced.Turning to the more permanent schemes for the decasualisation of labour, the general principles followed involve the registration of bond fide transport workers and the issue of tallies or tokens bearing the worker&apos;s registration number, which must be produced on engagement, if required. To safeguard the interests of men usually employed in the ports, these tallies or tokens are in the first place issued only to men employed in the port on the first day of the war, but provision is also generally made for a further issue of tallies(C 1817) A a
to men employed at later dates if the chances of employment of the bond fide transport workers are not prejudiced, while temporary employment tickets, available for a short period, may also be issued to meet sudden calls for additional1 workers. The main dif-ference between the schemes adopted lies, perhaps, in the method by which these tallies are issued. At Bristol, for example, the scheme for which has been adopted as a model in certain other ports, tallies are issued by the Dockers&apos; Union. In Newport, again, the scheme provides for the registration of all transport workers through the unions and the issue of quarterly cards to all men registered. Men who are not so registered may be employed only after reference to the Port Labour Officer. The system niore generally adopted, however, is the issue of the necessary certification by the Port Labour Committee itself.Some difficulty has arisen in the introduction of these schemes, as with those for out-of-work donation, in connection with the financial expenditure necessary for special premises. The Treasury sanction referred to above, however, has now removed this obstacle. A difficulty which in some quarters has proved more serious has arisen from the fact that the adoption of these schemes is purely voluntary, inasmuch as the Port Labour Committees have no compulsory powers for their enforcement. Negotiations therefore have in some cases been prolonged and difficult. Thus at Middlesbrough the introduction of a scheme was for some time delayed by a controversy over the method of registration, the workers&apos; union claiming that registration should be confined to members of the union and should be carried out by the union itself, while certain of the employers were in favour of registration by the Committee. A compromise was eventually reached on this point whereby the Port Labour Committee is responsible for all registrations, but the union will act, in respect of its members, as agent for the Committee. In Glasgow and Leith again, it has not yet been possible to introduce registration schemes which have been approved by the Port Labour Committee, owing to the fact that, although the union representative on the Committee has recommended the scheme the members of the union have not yet accepted it. The Tyne Port Labour Committee again, while accepting a scheme for the distribution of preference cards ensuring priority of employment for approved workmen, are not prepared to adopt any registration scheme excluding from the port men who are not on the register. On the whole, however, very considerable success has been attained in the introduction of these schemes. Excluding the smaller ports in which they have been judged unnecessary, registration schemes have been adopted in over two-thirds of the ports in which Port Labour Committees have been formed. The only case reported hitherto of refusal to co-operate in a scheme finally accepted by the Port Labour Committee comes from Aberdeen, and even here the refusal is confined to one employer alone.Paet III.-Press Comments.(1) Labour and Socialist Press. (A) Foreign Affairs.The Peace.The papers reviewed this week were written on the eve of the change of government in Germany : they therefore contain no reference to this event, but review the international situation as it was when the final edition of the Peace Treaty was delivered to the German Peace Delegation. There is in the papers little detailed discussion of particular modifica-tions introduced into the draft treaty, but the judgment of the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; upon the modifications as a whole is that they alter none of the fundamental objections to the treaty, and this opinion would.seem to be held by all the.writers who have been hostile to the peace. There is some repetition of the judgments which were originally passed upon the first draft. Mr. H. M. Brailsford, in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; maintains that the effective results of the peace (these are, he says, a French hegemony in Europe, while the United Kingdom and the United States have a monopoly of world trade) reveal the objects for which the war was really fought: and Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; echoes the terms of this verdict when (after denying the truth of Lord Robert Cecil&apos;s statements that the Covenant of the League of Nations provides for a true League of Peoples, and that the Covenant may be improved by amendments) he maintains that the insertion of the Covenant in the peace is a mere trick to hide the real purpose of the war. The &quot;Leeds Weekly Citizen &quot; asserts that President Wilson&apos;s &quot; Fourteen Points &quot; have been betrayed and deserted, but it is grateful for them, in view of its opinion that
they will remain a standard by which the peace documents may be judged in years to-, come. Neither the &quot; Nation &quot; nor Mr. J. H. Thomas, in his annual report to the N.U.R. (as quoted in the &quot; Railway Review &quot;), see promise of the future peace of the Avorld in the treaty, and the Labour Leader &quot; reiterates its frequently expressed opinion that the only hope of amendment lies in the International Labour Movement. Mr. Ramsay Mac-donald relates in &quot; Forward &quot; his purchase for 9d. in Berne of a copy of the first draft of the Peace Treaty, as communicated to the German Delegation. He asserts that the full details of the peace must be read in order properly to appreciate the petty vindictiveness which he alleges to characterise it, its impossibility as a working instrument and its danger to the peace of Europe. With regard to the proposed trial of the ex-Kaiser, Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; maintains that his responsibility for the war cannot be greater than that of many Allied statesmen. With, regard to the immediate past and future, the &quot;New Statesman&quot; suggests that the riot at Versailles on the departure of Count Brockdorfl-Rantzau to Versailles shows the character of the peace, which, it thus describes by the phrase &quot; Stones and broken bottles &quot; : while it maintains that it is just as impossible on moral grounds for the Allies to resume the war as it is on practical grounds for the Germans, because the moral aims of the Allies have already been achieved. &quot; The Call&quot; discusses the possibility of a counter-revolutionary coup d&apos;etat in Germany and is doubtful of the success there of any attempted Soviet Revolution.Russia.The publication of the correspondence dealing with the Allied &quot;recognition&quot; of Koltchak is the topic round which the discussion of Russian affairs in this week&apos;s papers centres. Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; does not think that Koltchak has satisfied any one of the conditions which, the Allies put forward as necessary to their recognition. In.&quot; Justice,&quot; M. Gavronsky insists on the importance of Koltchak actually fulfilling the guarantees he has given, and points out the danger there would be in allowing &quot; anti-Bolshevism&quot; to become synonymous in Russia wich &quot; counter-revolution.&quot; Colonel Wedgwood, M.P., gives detaib in &quot;Forward&quot; of alleged &quot;white&quot; atrocities in Russia. &quot; The Call&quot; maintains that the Russian problem is the supreme question now at issue : this paper outlines the achievements of the Bolsheviks and suggests that the future of the revolution, is assured.* It urges the working classes here to take effective steps to stop all attempts to crush the Russian &quot; Co-operative Commonwealth.&quot; The &quot; Leeds Weekly Citizen &quot; publishes an account of an interview with Miss Pattison (of the Society of Friends&apos; Russian Help Mission), who says that she was much impressed with the intentions of the Bolsheviks, but explains.that they were never in a position to carry out their intentions. &quot;Rob Roy&quot; in &quot;Forward&quot; says that Lenin must make peace with his Russian fellow Socialists before he is willing to sympathise with him.Japan.Japan is unfavourably mentioned on three occasions in this week&apos;s papers. Mr.. F. W. Jowett in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; alleges that both Italy and. France refuse to be associated with anti-Bolshevist measures, and the climax of his remarks is the sentence^ &quot; we share the dishonour with Japan.&quot; &quot; The Call&quot; attacks Japanese policy in China and &quot;Justice &quot; uses the attitude of reserve professed by the Japanese Foreign Minister towards International Labour Legislation (as reported in its previous issue) as an argument for some kind of Protection.The International.In view of the stress which is so frequently put upon the importance of the Inter-national Socialist Movement by some of these papers in their discussion of a possible revision of the Peace Treaty, the article by &quot; Rob Roy &quot; in &quot; Forward &quot; is of interest. He maintains that the International movement is utterly divided by the question of what, recognition is to be given to the Moscow movement. As noted above, lie thinks that Lenin must alter his policy before the recognition of Western Socialists should be given him. &quot;Justice&quot; criticises the congress held at Berne in February. It says that this was an irregular congress, and criticises the resolution it passed on the question, &quot; Who was responsible for the War ? &quot; as ambiguous, and the Labour Party&apos;s attitude at it toward the Irish question as misleading. This paper maintains that the Socialist move-ment must be consolidated within the separate countries before a strong International can be formed.  Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; criticises the proposed* Cf. the opinion of the &quot; New Statesman &quot; in Report, 11th June, p. i. (c 1817) A 4
constitution for the Berne International, which has been drafted by the so-called Acting Commission. He thinks that the T.U.C. is not a body suitable for affiliation with the International, and puts forward the argument that the double representation which would thus be secured on the International for the Trade Unions renders nugatory the provisions of the proposed constitution for the protection of Socialist minority parties.(B) Home Affairs.Finance.The new Funding Loans are the subject of much discussion. Mr. F. W. Jowett, in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; Mr. Philip Snowden and Sir Leo Chiozza Money, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; criticise the terms and the policy of the new issues. Mr. Snowden sug-gests that it will be the duty of the first Socialist Government in the reconstruction of the nation&apos;s financial system which it will be necessary for it to undertake, to consider even the repudiation of this loan. The &quot; Nation &quot; refers to the &quot; levity and recklessness &quot; of the Governments finance. &quot; Justice &quot; deals with the questions of Free Trade and Protection and puts forward the thesis that a slavish worship of the dogmas of Free Trade is of no help in adjusting our fiscal system to the changing needs of the times.Industrial Conference.The &quot; New Statesman &quot; refers to the forthcoming International Labour Congress in Washington, and confesses that it has no very great hope of this Congress proving itself a source of industrial progress. The value of the Congress in its opinion will depend upon what has previously been achieved in the great industrial countries. Therefore, it welcomes the &quot; important results &quot; which have been reached by the Industrial Conference, which it considers to be the best possible guarantee for the success of the Washington International Congress. It objects to the opinion which has been expressed (notably at the N.U.R. annual conference)* that the proposed Industrial Council will be a mere device for ensuring the continuance of the so-called capitalist system, and points out that the Council will have only advisory functions, and thus will not be able to clog the wheels of progress, and that each side in it will have the power of independent action.Coal Industry.The Duke of Northumberland is the object of many attacks in these papers for his speech delivered on the 12th June against nationalisation of the Coal Mines and against Mr. Smillie. The &quot; Clarion &quot; last weekf maintained that the policy of Nationalisation would depend for its success upon the retention in the service of the State of the present managers of the industry ; this week it adopts a slightly different position, and vigorously defends the present Civil Service against the charges of extravagance and habitual pro-crastination which have been laid against it. It is confident that the Civil Service will be able to do as well in peace as in war, and thinks the management of the Coal Industry by no means beyond its powers. Mr. William Stewart, in &quot; Forward,&quot; welcomes nationalisa-tion because he thinks nationalisation will mean a change from the present system under which wages are based on output.Labour Party and Trade Union Policy.The presidential address of Mr. Cramp to the annual meeting of the N.U.R. is com-mented upon in some papers.   The &quot; Clarion &quot; welcomes his admission that much training is yet required before the Trade Unions can hope to manage their own industries ; while&quot; Justice &quot; says that his statement that it was the object of Trade Unions to achieve such control, is &quot; mere moonshine.&quot;  The bulk of Trade Unionists, &quot; Justice &quot; maintains, haveno such object in view when they join their unions.  Mr. H. Alexander, in &quot; The Call,&quot;writes something of a rejoinder to Mr. Bryan&apos;s articles^ and argues that Soviets in Englandare not a practical proposition.  The I.L.P. journals all refer to the Labour Party Conferenceat Southport, and the opinion, would seem to be that the test questions before the Con-ference are the Russian question and the related issue of Conscription.  Mr. Philip Snowden,in the &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; in particular, urges that the Conference must respond to the franco-Italian invitation to join in a one-day general strike against intervention in Russia.The opinion of the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; is that the Labour Party will be on its trialat Southport, and that the verdict will depend upon what action is taken in this same matter. -.-* See p. 10 of the Report.f Report, 18th June, p. 7.J Cf. Report, 11th June, p. 6, and 18th June, p. 7.
On the other hand, the &quot; New Ages &quot; moralises upon the claim which has been put before th&amp; Court of Arbitration for a reduction in wages by the Engineering and Shipbuilding employers, and would seem to regret that Labour is spending so much time in passing resolutions about Russia, when there is in this claim a real and dangerous attack upon its economic power, to resist which it should keep its forces intact.Other.The &quot; Democrat &quot; deals with, the Housing Question, and suggests that the Land Tax clauses of the Finance Act, 1909, are responsible for much of the present shortage of houses. The same paper vigorously attacks the idea of land nationalisation. &quot; Justice &quot; repeats its demand for a continuance of the Food Control. Mr. Lovat Fraser explains in &quot;Forward &quot; his decision to join the Labour Party, and expresses the opinion that &quot; Tory Democracy&quot; which he thinks has owed its existence to the Disraeli tradition is nothing more than a sham.(2) The Daily Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.Unemployment of Ex-Service Men.The &quot; Daily Chronicle &quot; (24th June) considers the protests of trade unions against the failure to provide employment for disabled soldiers &quot; flagrant instances of hypocrisy.&quot; Trade unionists are largely responsible for that failure through their attitude to men trained by the Government. &quot; We do not go into the question whether the unions are justified or not in regarding them as dilutees .... but the unions have no right at one and the same time to exclude them from the skilled trades, and to create prejudice against the Government on the ground that it does not find them employment. Vastly more production will be required from industry than ever before, and it is quite practicable for the trade unions, in consultation with the Labour Ministry, to arrive at a scheme for the absorption of the trained ex-soldiers without in the least endangering the skilled trade standards.&quot;Part IV.-General Topics and District Reports. (1) General.Goal Mines Commission.The second interim report of the Coal Industry Commission was completed on the 20th June and published shortly afterwards. It consists of (a) a report by the Chairman in favour of the acquisition of all seams of coal (with fair compensation) by the State, and the immediate establishment of a hierarchy of Local, District and National Councils (representing the workers, the consumers, and the technical and commercial sides of the industry) with a view to the nationalisation of mines under a Minister of Mines (advised by a standing committee) three years hence. Arrangements are also suggested for pub-publicity of finance, research, improved safety, and for prevention of strikes by a clause in the workman&apos;s contract that he will not withhold his labour until the grievance in question has been before the Local, District and National Councils. Commercial managers and inspectors are to be retained, and the Mines Department is not to be recruited or con-ducted on ordinary Civil Service lines. Pending nationalisation, Coal Control is to be continued.(&amp;) A report by the three miners&apos; officials and the three socialist representatives, expressing substantial agreement with the Chairman&apos;s report, but making reservations on the limitation of the right to strike, the extent of representation of miners on the various councils, and (in the case of the miners&apos; officials) the payment of compensation.(c) A report by the three mineowners&apos; representatives together with two of the representatives of other industries (Mr. A. Balfour and Sir Allen Smith) recommending State acquisition of coal and the establishment of joint committees, but opposing nationalisation of mines in any form.(d) A report signed only by Sir A. Duckham agreeing broadly with (c), but propounding a scheme for the amalgamation of colliery interests in the several districts in the form of statutory companies.There is thus a unanimous opinion in favour of the acquisition of mineral rights, a majority of 10 to 3 for compensation, and of 7 to 6 for nationalisation in 1920.
Protests against the recommendations of Mr. Justice Sankey has been entered by Mr. Pausey (solicitor for the Royalty Owners&apos; Joint Committee), by the Coal Association and by a meeting held on the 23rd June, under the joint auspices of the Imperial Com-mercial Association and the Coal Association. The Parliamentary Coal Committee has asked the Prime Minister and Mr. Bonar Law to meet a deputation &quot; representative of all those opposed to the principle of nationalisation.&quot;Coal Output.Many int.:&apos;resting statements on this subject have been published during the past week. Both the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation and the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association have instituted enquiries in the pits of their respective areas as to the extent and causes of the decline in output. The consensus of the replies received so far appears to throw the blame on shortage of material, particularly trucks and trams, for which neither managers nor men are held accountable. Reports state that in a number of Derbyshire pits this shortage is at present causing short time to be worked. On the other hand, the Secretary of the South Wales and Monmouthshire Coal Owners&apos; Association estimates a loss of over 10 million tons during the last twelve months owing to avoidable absenteeism. Mr. Vernon Hartshorn, M.P., contributes frequent articles to the South Wales press urging the necessity for greater efforts in order to justify the estimates on which the Sankey report was based.Railwaymen.The Annual Delegate Meeting of the N.U.R. was continued on the 19th and 20th June. Resolutions were passed condemning the system of government at present in operation in Ireland, against the use of British troops in Russia, supporting the Triple Alliance (in particular in its attitude of aloofness from the National Industrial Conference) and protesting against the present Income Tax level. Complaints were made of the ten-dency of railway companies to employ casual labour, and of the delay in the negotiations on behalf of supervisory grades, but it is noteworthy that a more drastically-worded amendment expressing general resentment at the progress of the negotiations received only five votes. One of the subjects which was expected to give rise to the keenest debate at the conference the proposal to debar Union Officials from political positions-was referred back to a Committee. Following on the delegate meetings, the N.U.R. approved Society met on the 21st June. A resolution was passed calling for an increase of 100 per cent, in cash benefits under the Insurance Act.  .There has been at this Conference at any rate among the more vocal elements a tone approximating more closely to that of the corresponding elements in the M.F.G.B. than has usually been the case with the railwaymen, and unusual prominence has been given to general and political issues. It is possible that this may not be unconnected with the absence of Mr. Thomas in America.The 21st Annual Conference of the Railway Clerks&apos; Association was held in Nottingham on the 20th and 21st June. The presidential address (by Mr. W. E. Williams, London) contained strong criticisms of Bolshevism and syndicalist action, and a plan for the representation on the future governing body of the national transport system of the travelling and trading public as well as the workers. Unlike the N.U.R. the Railway Clerks approved by a large majority the National Industrial Council scheme, provided that guarantees were forthcoming that legislative effect would be given to its findings. Other resolutions urged the speeding up of action as regards housing, welcomed the proposed nationalisation of transport, and condemned the sale of national factories and the so-called secret military circulars. A motion to re-open negotiations with the N.U.R. with a view to fusion was disposed of by carrying the previous resolution that more urgent problems should be settled before any such change was contemplated, but it may be noted that correspondence in the current number of the &quot; Railway Review &quot; reveals that the sec-retaries of the two Unions are endeavouring to arrange a meeting with the purpose of an amicable settlement of the disputed subject of the organisation of the supervisory grades, and also that the claims of the R.C.A. in that matter are indicated in the new title it has now adopted, Railway Clerical and Admiiiistrative Staff Association of Great Britain and Ireland. It is reported that at a private session the report of the Executive Committee with regard to the negotiations on the national programme was approved, with some complaints of the delay in their progress.  Mr. T. H. Gill (York), was elected President.Miners.The Annual Conference of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation was continued at Cardiff on the 19th, 20th and 21st June.   Resolutions against conscription and the
Russian expedition, as well as the present modes of government in Ireland, India and Poland, were passed, and it was decided that if all political prisoners, &amp;c, were not released within 28 days, a conference should be called to consider industrial action, and that if all Allied forces in Russia were not withdrawn within 28 days, the Triple Alliance should be urged to call for a general strike. The payment of members of local governing bodies and increased payment of M.P.&apos;s were also demanded, and a resolution condemning profiteering in food and clothes was passed. Industrial resolutions included demands for the con-fiscation of mining royalties, the supply of house coal at 5s.&apos; a ton to workmen with families living in apartments, for the immediate erection of pit-head baths without charge on the workmen, free provision and repair of miners&apos; tools, and abolition of Sunday labour except where absolutely necessary. The national programme was re-affirmed in a resolution which declared that the increasing tendency to resort to machine-production emphasised the necessity for national ownership with a view to stricter safety regulations.- it was also decided to carry out a campaign for making the S.W.M.F. and the Colliery Officials&apos; Union the only recognised unions in the industry. To enforce this policy, the Federation refused to support miners who struck in sympathy with the colliery clerks of Messrs. Cory Bros. (Cardiff) and urged its members, if they were thrown idle through the action of the clerks, to remain out till all workmen in the coalfield had joined the Federation. As a result negotiations are now proceeding with regard to the transference of all colliery&apos; clerks in South Wales from the N.U.C. to the S. W.M.F. In this connection it ma y be added that the Derbyshire Miners&apos; Federation has entered an emphatic protest against a local strike of colliery clerks which is throwing miners idle.Labour Party Conference^A preliminary meeting to the conference at Southport was held on the 22nd June in the form of a demonstration addressed by Mr. Robert Smillie and Mr. Ramsay Mac-donald. On the 23rd June the Executive met and drafted emergency resolutions, and on the 24th a conference of women representatives was held, under the presidency of Mrs. Susan Lawrence, to discuss the work of women in the Labour Party. Housing and food control were the principal subjects discussed. In the afternoon a joint conference with Labour Party agents was presided over by Mr. Sidney Webb ; resolutions on housing, food control, old age pensions, unemployment among women, intervention in Russia, and Conscription were passed.The conference proper began on the 24th June. Mr. J. McGurk, Chairman of the Executive, delivered the presidential address, in which critical references were made to the policy of intervention in Russia, and to the &quot;unhappy compromise &quot; on which he believed the Peace and the League of Nations to be based. He also opposed the policy of direct action, remarking that the political weapon had not yet been given a lair trial  as witness the Trade Union vote in the last election. This reference to-&quot; direct action &quot; proved the storm-centre of the morning&apos;s debate.A paragraph in the report of the executive stated that &quot; if the British Labour move-ment is to institute a new precedent in our industrial history by initiating general strikes for the purpose of achieving ... a political object, it is imperative that the Trade Unions . . . should realise the responsibility which such a strike movement entails, and should themselves determine the ground plan of any such campaign.&quot;Mr. R. Williams (N.T.W.F.) spoke in defence of direct action, and Mr. Smillie moved that this paragraph be referred back. Mr. J. Sexton opposed the motion, which was seconded by Mr. J. Bromley (A.S.L. and E.F.). Mr. W. Bruce supported the motion, but on grounds of procedure. Mr. A. Henderson explained the paragraph, and persuaded Mr. Smillie .to withdraw his motion, with the understanding that the issue would be raised again at a later stage of the Conference. At the afternoon session, adverse criticism was passed on the attendances put in by Labour members in Parliament. Mr. W. Adam son, &quot;M.P., defended the Parliamentary Labour Party, and a motion to refer back its report was rejected. The fact that the question of direct action should have been prominent at this Conference is significant. The attitude of the Chairman in the matter is also worth noting. *MM. Longuet and Frossard, French delegates to the Labour Party Conference, were detained at Folkestone by the police. Other French and Italian delegates, as well as M. Branting, who came via London, reached Southport without difficulty having satisfied Scotland Yard on certain points. MM. Longuet and Frossard subsequently returned to -France.* The agenda appeared in the Weekly Report for the 14th May, 1919.
Co-operation.v The Annual Congress of the Women&apos;s Co-operative Guild was opened at Middlesbrough on the 24th June. A representative of the Joint Committee of Russian Organisations addressed the Congress, and resolutions were passed to promote active alliance between co-operative and trade union movements, protesting against Conscription and military training in schools, and urging the necessity for the development of international co-operative trade. In this latter connection it may be noted that an agreement has been made for the direct interchange of goods between the Co-operative Wholesale Society in Manchester and large groups of co-operative societies in Southern Russia, the Ail-Russian Central Union of Consumers&apos; Societies in London being accepted as guarantors. It has been decided to form a Local Advisory Committee of Trade Unionists and Co-operators for Swindon district. An interesting development in co-operative enterprise is reported from South Wales, where a union of working men&apos;s clubs has purchased a brewery (under the title of the South Wales Club Brewery Company), with a view to remedying the beer shortage by a supply of good and cheap beer to the clubs.Other Conferences.The Annual Conference of the National Federation of Blastfurnacemen was held in Keswick on the 20th and 21st June. A resolution advocating nationalisation of banks was passed.   (See also under &quot; Amalgamation.&quot;)The Annual Conference of the Operative Bakers and Confectioners of Scotland National Federal Union was held in Greenock on the 17th June and the following days. A proposal to abolish the J.I.C. for the Scottish Baking Industry was negatived by 49 votes to 36. It was resolved to press for a 44-hour week with overtime rates, to protest against the use of female labour or overtime while unemployed men were available, and to press for the raising of the Income Tax limit to  320.Conscription, &amp;c.In addition to resolutions passed at the conferences mentioned above, a number of resolutions from local labour bodies against Conscription, the use of British troops in Russia, and participation in the peace celebrations, have appeared from time to time in &apos; the press. In spite of the efforts of the Rank and File Conference, convened by the London Workers&apos; Committee on the 15th June, to promote a general strike on the 23rd June, in conjunction with France and Italy, as a demonstration against Conscription, the Blockade, intervention in Russia and Hungary, and the imprisonment of political offenders, only one body of workers a number of miners in the Doncaster district is known to have carried out that policy. The Joint Executive of the Triple Alliance has resolved to call a delegate conference of miners, railwaymen and transport workers on the 23rd July to ascertain whether it is supported by the rank and file in its proposal for industrial action against Conscription, &amp;c. It also proposes to wait on the Government to urge the raising of the Income Tax limit.bA-hour Week.A 44-hour week has recently been demanded by Scottish operative bakers and by co-operative workers at the Grangemouth Soap Works (Scotland), by employees in the furnishing trade at Manchester, and by the National Union of General Workers on behalf of its members employed by municipalities, and has been obtained as a result of a strike by Mersey lightermen and by Glasgow dressmakers. Chemical workers who are members of the National Federation of General Workers are also balloting on the question of a 44-hour week, but reports state that drastic action is not likely to be taken.Amalgamations, dc. 1The United Kingdom Society of coach makers is arranging to amalgamate with kindred unions into the National Union of Vehicle Builders. The four unions of builders&apos; : labourers affiliated to the National Building Trades Federation are considering amah gamation. It is also stated that balloting in the National Union of Journalists is running strongly in favour of affiliation with the*Printing and Kindred Trades Federation, and that the five district associations included in the National. Federation of Blastfurnacemen have agreed on the principle of complete amalgamation. On the other hand, officials of the United Textile Factory Workers&apos; Union deny the report that the cotton textile unions contemplate joining the Triple Alliance, and the council of the Friendly Society of Iron-founders is balloting its members on the question of withdrawal from the Federation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Trades, and also from the General Federation of Trade Unions.
.New Unions.The National Association of Industrial Chemists is seeking registration as a trade union. Legal, shipping, municipal, insurance, and other clerks in Liverpool and district are proposing to form a Mersey District Commercial and Technical Workers&apos; Council for the organisation of non-manual workers, and a Guild for clerks engaged in the engineering trade in London is being organised by the N.U.C. The Amalgamated Society of Pharma-cists, Drug and Chemical Workers is reported to be rapidly organising workers in the wholesale drug and chemical trade.Profit-sharmg.At the request of the Stavely Coal and Iron Company the General Secretary of the Derbyshire Miners&apos; Association has consented to make himself jointly responsible for seeing that the scheme of profit-sharing which the Company recently arranged for the employees&quot; is fairly carried out. He states, however, that he is endeavouring to ensure &quot;that the shares shall carry some controlling interest. Mr. C. H. Smithson of Bradford has announced a scheme of profit-sharing and co-partnership to his 400 textile employees and Messrs. John Mackintosh have introduced a &quot; Victory &quot; bounty scheme for the benefit of their employees at the Albion Confectionery Works, Halifax.Police.The Metropolitan branch of the Police and Prison Officers&apos; Union met on the 19th June and decided not to &quot; resign either from the union or from the service if called upon to do so.&quot; Mr. Bromley of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen is reported to have declared at the meeting that the rank and file of Trade Unionism was behind the Police movement. The Union is stated to have issued -an appeal to all Trade Unions, Trade Councils, Local Labour Parties, &amp;c, soliciting their support in its cause and resolutions to that effect have&apos;been passed by a number of these bodies.Oilfields.The recent discovery of oilfields near Chesterfield has given rise to a number of resolutions from Labour organisations against the possibility of the exploitation of the national oil resources for private profit.Trade Boards:Sugar Confectionery and Food Preserving Trade Board (Great Britain).The Minister of -Labour having given his consent thereto, the Sugar Confectionery and Food Preserving Trade Board (Great Britain), have issued a Notice of Proposal, dated 17th June, 1919, to vary the general minimum time-rates for female workers so that they shall receive the general minimum time-rates now applicable to men while employed in certain occupations in the trade which are considered men&apos;s occupations.Draft Special Orders.Statutory notice has been given of the Ministers intention to bring within the scope of the Trade Boards Acts the whole of the men&apos;s and women&apos;s clothing trades and the hat, cap and millinery trade.. Joint Industrial Councils.Cable Making. A request has been received from the National Union of General Workers to re-open negotiation for a J.I.C. The Cable Makers&apos; Association is stated to be favourable.Edge Tools. A difficulty in the formation of a J.I.C. has arisen through the objection of the Craft Union in Birmingham and District to co-operate with. General Labour Unions on a Council.Government Industrial. Departmental Joint Conferences have been held by the Admiralty and the Ministry of Munitions (on the 20th and 19th June respectively) with re-presentatives of Trade Unions having members in the respective establishments. In each, case discussion centred round bond fide Trade Union character of certain of organisations concerned as representing the employee&apos;s side on Departmental Committees or ,J.I.C.&apos;s formed in either department.Civil Service. The Report of the National Joint Committee on the application of the Whitley Report to the Civil Service has been presented to Parliament, and is now published (Cmd. 198).Welsh Plate and Sheet. An unofficial report states that at a meeting of the Council a partial agreement was reached on the operatives&apos; demands regarding hours and wages, and it was further agreed to send a joint delegation to America to study industrial conditions there.
(2) District Reports.London and South-Eastern.Unemployment. The decrease in the numbers of unemployed continues. Transport difficulties are causing manufacturers serious embarrassment both in obtaining delivery of materials and in disposing of manufactured goods.South Midlands and Eastern.Unemployment. Decreases of unemployed are reported from every Exchange in the Division. Here, too, transport conditions appear to militate against the full development of industry.Resettlement. At Northampton 96 per cent, of the demobilised men dealt with by the Local Employment Committee have been absorbed in industry.General.-The wages demands - of the enginemen and firemen in the Derby and Nottingham coal mines are in course of being settled by arbitration.South- Western.U employment.-The improvement in the unemployment figures still continues. In the Surveyors Department of the Plymouth Corporation out of 270 men employed, 100 are ex-service men. About 170 men will be discharged in the immediate future from Devonport Dockyard. The Dartmoor electrical power scheme will, if developed, involve an outlay of  1,000,000, and the promoters claim that power can be obtained equivalent to the output of 75,000 tons of coal annually.The use of railway transport instead of the pre-war coastal shipping intensifies the shortage of wagons and produces congestion at the docks. It is apparently more profitable to employ vessels in transport to the Continent.West Midlands.Unemployment. The only district showing an increase of unemployment is Dudley, where it is due chiefly to a strike of miners.   These, however, are now returning to work.In Birmingham there are three ex-soldiers unemployed to every civilian out of work. In Oswestry nine-tenths of the unemployed are demobilised men. In Smethwick un-employment among these men is increasing at the rate of about 50 per week. In Walsall 1,100 out of 1,500 on the Register are ex-service men.General. While there is no general unrest, considerable discontent is manifested in connection with food prices and delays in dealing with the housing problem.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Unemployment. Unemployment is gradually being reduced, especially among women. Investigations in the chemical, leather, wire-drawing, and rope-making industries indicate that these trades are prosperous and have sufficient work both in hand and in prospect.Complaints are made of the unsatisfactory position of the housing scheme in Notting-ham, where no application in connection with the scheme has yet been made to the Local Government Board.Larger numbers of women are entering domestic service, but there is little desire for training for this occupation.Efforts by the Emplojinent Council to further schemes of the Huddersfield manu-facturers to establish a clothing industry at Sheffield or Rotherham are having good results.General.-Industrial matters are generally fairly quiet at present. There is trouble in the Hull trawling industry as the result of a claim by the engineers that two trimmers shall be employed on all boats engaged in the Icelandic trade, irrespective of their size.The owners will not concede the demands, which it is expected will be made also by engineers on the boats engaged in the North Sea fishery.North-Western.Unemployment. The continued improvement in the cotton industry has been largely responsible for a decrease of unemployment. There has also been an important reduction of unemployment in the engineering trades, but in other industries the figures show little improvement.There is much local dissatisfaction with the delay in the housing scheme at Preston,, where, although about 2,000 houses are needed, no progress whatever seems to have been, made.
General. In addition to perhaps because of-the cotton trade dispute, labour in ;general is restless.. The Mersey lightermen have resumed work, but the dockers persist in their refusal to work overtime.Northern.Unemployment. The largest decreases of unemployment have been in Newcastle and Gateshead. The strikes in Middlesbrough are causing unemployment in the Tees-side district, rolling mills and other plants being put out of operation.The position in the hematite mining district of Cumberland is serious, and continuous discharges are taking place. The reason given for this state of affairs is the high cost of production; the present cost of winning the hematite ore is stated to be 55s., while the price offered by the blast furnaces is only 35s. Some of the smaller mines are expected to close down before long, and there appears to be a danger of the whole industry drifting towards collapse.Wales.Unemployment. Small decreases in unemployment are reported from every district. Complaints have been made of the shortage of wagons; in Wrexham this is likely to bring . a brick works to a standstill.General.-Th.e high cost of coal and coke is causing alarm in the tinplate, steel and other metal industries in South Wales. Competition with America is possible only so long as the present high cost of freightage continues. The Scandinavian market is being lost by the high prices of Welsh tinplates and black plates. A joint delegation of employers and workmen has been appointed to visit the United States to report upon the tinplate industry there. The cost of the visit will be borne to the extent of two-thirds by the employers&apos; association, and one-third by the trade unions.Scotland.Unemployment. The improvement in trade is generally maintained. The problem of absorbing ex-service men is, however, proving a difficult one.The burnt island Shipbuilding Works which are likely to lose their workers through want of housing accommodation, have asked the Admiralty to permit them to utilise H.M.S. Pharos as a hostel.Paet V.-Disputes. (a) Involving a Stoppage of Work.  .Textile Workers.For Lancashire cotton strike, see Part I of this report.The weavers employed at the Cilwendeg Mills, Henllan (Wales) are on strike owing to the reduction of hands due to the introduction of Northrop looms.Coal Miners.The strike of colliery clerks in South Wales ended on the 25th June. An agreement has been reached that all commercial staffs shall be represented on the Joint Wages Board recently set up.As a protest against the sending of British troops to Russia, the miners at five pits in the Doncaster district struck on the 24th June, for 24 hours.Ironworkers.The notices to cease work having expired, the employees at the Bromley Iron Works, Brierley Hill, are on strike against the newly fixed rates.Clothing Trades.With reference to the strike of West End tailors which was settled on the 11th June, pending arbitration, it is stated that a deadlock has occurred in the negotiations, the workers having emphatically rejected the employers&apos; offer.&quot; A strike of London Warehousemen and Packers employed by wholesale drapery firms, occurred on the 18th June, work was resumed on the 20th June. The National Warehouse and General Workers&apos; Union has been recognised by the employers, and the employees&apos; wage demands will be discussed next month.Building Trade.A strike throughout the Building and Allied Trades began at Carlisle on the 20th June. The dispute is due to dissatisfaction at the delay of the Ministry of Labour in communicating their decision as to whether the wage rate fixed by the North Western area Joint Council is applicable to Carlisle.
Dyers.The strike in the Nottingham Lace dyeing industry was settled yesterday; the wages dispute is to be referred to an arbitrator appointed by the Ministry of Labour. The strike in. the hosiery finishing trade, however, is assuming serious proportions.Agricultural.Three hundred farm labourers are on strike in Glamorgan Vale, the farmers having refused to grant wages above those fixed by the Wages Board. About 1,000 have struck in the Tarporley district of Cheshire against the wages fixed by the Wages Board.At a meeting of Yorkshire Milk Producers on the 17th June, it was resolved that every producer should gradually cut down his supplies in view of the refusal of the Food Controller to increase prices.Rent Strike.It is stated that the no-rent strike at Dudley will be settled by the Local Government Board, whose decision will be binding on both parties.Co-operative Employees.The workers at the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society&apos;s Grangemouth Soap Works have been given authority by the A.U.C.E. Executive to withdraw their labour owing to the refusal of the directors to grant the 44-hour week without reduction in wages.Other Strikes Settled.The Mersey flatmen resumed work on the 20th June. The employers have granted extra pay for navigation at night, and additional hands on larger barges.The Dublin hotel dispute has been definitely settled. Higher wages and a 72-hour week, are among the concessions.(6) Not Involving a Stoppage of WorkCoal Miners.Considerable dissatisfaction is said to exist in the Midlands over the alleged nonfulfilment of a Government pledge to make a change in the payment of horse drivers as soon as the war was over.  The Cannock Chase Miners&apos; Council threatens to take drastic action in the matter.It is reported that the introduction of double shifts with the shorter working day is not approved of by the South Wales miners.Jute Workers.The Dundee jute workers asked for a joint council to be set up to consider the question of: wages and hours. The employers have refused this request, however, on the ground that a Trade Board is to be set up in the industry.Woodworkers.At a meeting of London members of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners-and the General Union of Carpenters and Joiners on the 23rd June, the report of the ballot on the premium bonus dispute was received. It is stated that there was a large majority in favour of a general strike to enforce the demand for the withdrawal of the premium bonus system. Strikes on this matter are already in progress at Lincoln, and in the London works of Messrs. Vickers, the Handley Page Company, &amp;c.Actors.Negotiations between the Actors Association, and the Touring Managers&apos; Association and Theatrical Managers&apos; Association have broken down over the question of payment for rehearsals on provincial tours.  A further meeting is called for the 6th July.Bakers.There are complaints among the operative bakers in London that the master bakers are pressing their employees to resume night work pending the issue of the report of the Committee set up to enquire into the question. The men threaten to strike if the report is not received within the next fortnight.R. S. HORNE.All inquiries relating to this report should be addressed to :-Intelligence Division,Ministry oe Labour,Montagu House,Whitehall,London,IS.W.1,
