Jjfr Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,CONGESTION OF PORTS if] THE UNITED&apos;TIlTCtITO( 201&apos; ;\A2  MEMORANDUM BY THE POOD CONTROLLER,desire to draw the attention of the War Cabinet to the p^pSnli congested state of the    ports in this country, which is &quot;&quot;gravely embarrassing the importation and distribution of food-stuffs r   Unless some action is taken immediately I am afraid ,that there is every probability of a shortage of imported food-stuffs in general, and of bacon, meat, cereals and tea in particular0 I understand from the Port and Transit Executive Committee that the present difficulties arise from the inability of ports to discharge and despatch the large importations which are now reaching them. I am unable, of course, to- state what has brought about these difficulties which, in some quarters, are attributed to the various concessions which have been made to labour organisations, in others to the blocking of the ports by raw materials in the course of trans-shipment to European destinations, and in others to the decline of coastwise traffic.As one instance of the difficulties which are being exper-experienced, I should like to quote the case of bacon.   I had arranged&apos; with the Shipping Controller that during the next nine weeks there should be a weekly average importation of 15,50.0 tons of bacon divided amongst the ports as follows ?&apos;-Liverpool 6,500 tonsLondon 5,500   &quot;Other ports        3,500   &quot;Total 15,500   &quot;Owing to the fact that this country.is at present almost entirely dependent on North America-for its supplies of bacon,, it is . imperative that the full shipping programme should be carried out in order to meet current requirements,- and.to build up stock during August&apos;and- September when bacon&apos;is in short supply in America* Bacon is carried from North America in liner space,., and the storage and distribution facilities at ports other .than London and Liverpool are extremely limited, so that it is&apos; necessary that the great bulk   . of the importations should be landed at those two portsr   Within the last few days, however, as a result of reports from the Port and Transit Executive Committee, the&apos; Shipping Controller has cabled to New York and Montreal informing the Lines; that Liverpool and London, can only-handle 3,000 tons and 2,000 tons of bacon respectively during the next nine-weeks,, and asking them to see that this quantity is not exceeded although bookings may be made to other portsc Sir Joseph Maclay has informed me of these instructions, and also that even these small quantities of bacon cannot be landed at Liverpool and&apos; London unless certain almost impossible&apos;conditions are fulfilled.   The weekly consumption of bacon is at present approxim-ately 10,000 tons, and our reserves are.almost negligible,&apos;  It is obvious that if the Shipping Controller:s instructions are to hold good, there will be a bacon famine in this country in a very few weeks.-   I have therefore written to the Shipping Controller asking that these instructions may be cancelled; and that orders may be given to the Port Authorities at Liverpool and London that bacon up to the amount previously agreed should have absolute priority until further instructions are received from the Cabinet.The position is so serious that&apos; I suggest the holding of an immediate enquiry into the causes of the congested state of the ports with a view to such action as is necessary being taken to relieve the situation, and that in the meantime absolute priority of discharge and handling should be given to food-stuffs.   If the ports cannot handle all the food that is essential to the maintenance of the ^population as well as the other goods coming forward, then it is m&quot;clear that the other goods, and not food, must be held back.Ministry of Pood. 25th June 1919.GEO. H, ROBERTS.
