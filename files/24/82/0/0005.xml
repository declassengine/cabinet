I trust that the Cabinet will be able to come to an early and favourable decision upon them.4o- The improvements recommended are long overdue.    There has been ho general review of the pay of Officers of the Royal Navy since 1869, when the proposals subsequently embodied in Order-in-Council of 22nd February 1670 were approvedo    But even that review can hardly be said to have led to a revision of the scales of pay generally.    Tho basic rates on which the present scales are built up are of prior date^ and all that was .done in 1869 was to fill up gaps and make improvements in one direction or another * Thus the present rates of pay of Flag Officers date back to the year 1816; those of Captains to June 1864, and tho maximum rate of a Pa:/master Commander dates from 1854*    The initial rate of pay of a Lieutenant was fixed at 10/s a day in 1854, and this rate was still in existence at the outbreak of war and is now only 12/s without the bonus granted last Februaryc   The Camnanders5 rate was fixed at 20/s in 1864 and is now 23/s a day*   The scale for Chaplains and Naval Instructors laid down in 1870 Is still in existence with a few minor improvements in the lower grades .:m&amp;o. in 1917*5.   Other Branches, namely, Engineer Officers, Medical Officers and Marines, have received special consideration during the last 16 years beginning with 1903, but oven in their case in considering the revised scales regard was had to the previous rates of pay and also to the rates of pay of Executive Officers, which, as previously stated, have remained almost unchanged.6.- The same remarks apply to the scales      Half-pay.   As regards pensions, the present scales were laid down in 1870 and are practically the same as they were then, though minor improvements not affecting the main body of officers have been made from time to time*7*- It will be apparent from the above that the question of the Pay of Naval Officers has not received consideration for a very long time, and the Board of Admiralty have felt that in making their recommendations they are probably also settling the question for many years to come.(Signed..    W. H. LONG..18th June 1919.
