I 36SITUATION IN THE BALTIC-Admiralty Memorandum for the Var Cabinet.In the event of the Peace Terms being signed, theAdmiralty consider that the situation in the Baltic shouldbe reviewed- 11The Terms of Armistice, which provided for the * German forces evacuating the Baltic Provinces, have not yet been oarried out, and it is not unlikely that the   enemy will attempt to evade these particular JJerrns after the Poace has been signed in the sane manner as he has so far succeeded in doing during the seven months of Armistioe-.It is evidently the German polioy to over-run and occupy the Baltic Provinces if he can, and the question therefore arises whether the blockade should be instituted and maintained, even after Peace has been signed^until the Germans have withdrawn their forces from these Provinces.The reason for the presence of British Naval forces in the Baltic is to safeguard the flanks of our friends, but if the Germans sueoead in occupying these Provinces, the flanks will not be existent and there will be nothing for our Naval forces.to do in this direction.Under such circumstances, should our forces be withdrawn from the Baltic or should they remain there?:. If they are withdrawn, it is conueivable that the absence of the White Ensign would cause a loss of prestige and would help to encourage the Bolshevik forces; whereas, if they remain, they could only do so under the friendly auspices of the Danes, the Swedes or the Finns,, a most undesirable state of affairs.(signed)   R. E. WEMYSS. 18th June, 1919.Forwarded.(signed)!/. H. LONG 18.   VI.    19.
