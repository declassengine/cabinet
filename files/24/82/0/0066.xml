Aooording to advioes from Paris the peaoe Treaty will be signed at 2 p,m, on Saturday;   that hour will be taken by thousands of men, enlisted under the Derby Scheme, to be the moment that they oah claim demobilisation, and a very large number of the men will probably attempt to &quot;demobilise themselves&quot;.The efforts of the extremists to bring about a twenty-four hours&apos; International Strike have failed.   If it is taken to be a test of the strength of the revolutionary faotion the result is reassuring,A group cf Frenoh and extreme Sooialiats, headed by Jean Longuet have arsived in England for tho Labour Party Conferenoe at Southport. Longuet was detained at Folkestone for instruotions, but without waiting for these he returned to Paris.    Information had been reoeived by the Frenoh, from a trustworthy souroo, that Longuet was bringing to England a considerable sum .of money, supplied from German souroos. His party is reported to have been making a speoial oampaign among the Frenoh troops of inoitement tc mutiny.    The Frenoh delegates intend W return to Fronoe on Saturday.Unrest is growing ainong agricultural labourers, especially in Norfolk.The/
Ohe agitation regarding intervention in Russia, Inocme Tax, tho Housing Scheme, Conscription, and the Insufficient supply of beer continues;   these grievances, togethor with theVising cost of living are, the stools in trade of extremist agitators&apos;, wh,pvare constantly urging direct aotion.$he Peaoe Celebrations will fill tho thoughts of wcrking-m6n next week and if it were not for the trouble with the&quot;Derby sen&quot; in tho Army, there would be no oause for immediate anxiety.
The present position appears to be that the older men of the Metropolitan Forces are rather ashamed of the., notoriety they acquired by the strike last August and by the threatened strike a month ago and are withdrawing their support from the Union.   Tho younger firebrands are pleased with their newspaper fane, and the offioials of the Union are fighting for their salaries.    They are making great efforts to secure the support of other Trade Union . . branches and Trades Councils, and with that object they have been circulating.a secret pamphlet, of which a oopy has been obtained..    The Prison Warder3 appear to be pleased with the concessions made to thorn by the Treasury.There aro signs of a. recrudescence of grumbling owing to the delay in publiahing the recommendations of Lord Desborough&apos;3 Committee,     It seems very desirable that -these should be issued as early as possible.At a mass meeting of the Union held at Mile and on 19th June., attended by a.considerable number of policemen, a resolution was passed pledging the audience to refuso to leave the Union or to. resign from the service if oalled - upon to do so,. . Bromley, of the amalgamated Sooiety of  Jnginemen and Firemen, declared that the rank and file of Trade Unionism was behind the. Polioe movement.     It was also stated that during the last three weeks 1,000 new members have been enrolled., but it is believed that this in (Juite contrary to the fact..On the 22nd June, the Liverpool Labour Party passed a resolution oalling upon the Liverpool TradeiUnions to support the Police Union.    Hayes and Marston are to address a meeting there very shortly.Meanwhile there is trouble about the funds;   the older/
older members..are calling for an audit, and there are &quot;whispers that Marston has been drawing a considerable weekl^H allowance from the funds, and that if the Union breaks up the&apos; officials will claim any bank balance as.due to them &quot;i.in lieu of their promised salary.ANTMNTflRVEHTION III RUSBIA.Tom Mann has been rather active among the&apos; dock . labourers.    At 147, Sa^t India Dook Road, a&apos;room has been taken for plokets of the Communist party, who are stopping men  aid munitions from going to Russia. &apos;Strongly worded, resolutions regarding&apos;&apos;intervention were passed by the National Union of Railwaymen&apos;, by the South Wales Miners1 Federation and by the Manchester and Distriot &quot;Hands off liissia&quot; Conference&apos;*In this connection a ourioua light has been thrown upon the methods of Sylvia Pankhurst.     In the- &quot;Socialist&quot; of June 19th, appeared a notice that a special emissary from Lenin had been smuggled into this country.-&apos;   According to the : &quot;Call&quot; of June 12th the man had left Russia on May 20th and Ivii as Pankhurst informed &quot;her friends that she was maintaining him secretly in an hotel, but that no-Che else&apos; could have acooss to him.    Careful observation and enquiry leave little doubt that he is a mythical person&apos;.   1 Miss Pahkhurst1 s method is to get hold of seamen and cooks&apos; returning from Eastern Europe, and if they make unfavourable reports of the Bolsheviks to bow them out, but, if otherwise, to put into their mouths&apos; coloured reports that she has reooived from other souroes.    She has stated to friends that she has &quot; ^cess to late&apos;Bus  it an journals ,* obtained for her by someone -   the War Office&quot; on loan for&quot; a&apos; few.hours.    This is being investigated.The Russian People&apos;a Information Bureau is certainly   mdoing/
doing some misohief by the circulation of fraudulent information.BEER SHORTAGE.The beer shortage remains acute and is still a souroe of dissatisfaction.The South Wales Club Union Miners are reported to have puohased a brewery for  20,000.    This experiment is being watched by the workers with great interest.LIVERPOOL.Reports from Liverpool ar0 not very reassuring;   there is feeling about intervention in Russia, restrictions on trade development and profiteering.    race hatred is still acute in the distrlot, particularly among ex-Servioe men, who resent the employment of coloured men in the Liverpool warehouses.    They demand that if these men oannot be deported they should be segregated.NATIONAL FEDERATION OF DISCHARGED &amp; DEMOBILISED SAILORS &amp; SOLDIERS. .The finanoial position of tho Federation is reported toho precarious.    At the iianohester Conferenoe the General- ,; Secretary13 salary was fixed at  450, and the Organiserfsat  500.    There was disagreement about the politicalattitude of the Party.The Southport branoh of the Federation is now conveningan unofficial National Conference on the grounds that the manchester Conference was unrepresentative.    It isappealing especially to all the branches exoluded from theoffioial conference and to all who opposed the proposal to admit commissioned offioers to become members.-S.-\ILQR3 7

It has deoid not to amalgamate with the National.Union of ex-Servi men.    A new brenoh has boen formed at tho R.A.F. Cami Sleaford, and efforts are being made to form branoheo at Cologne, Wendover and Oxford.

Wild speeches were made&apos; loy various delegates and the whcAetone/

i ioperatives in L-Gods,&apos;to the number of 6,000, will strike from 25th - 27th June, to draw attention to the Polish pogroms.    They have placarded the distriot with mourning posters.THE COMMUNIST PARTY.It is too early to say whether this very active little party is likely to make headway; besides its progress in London,.it is reported to be gaining adherents at Nottingham .Printing for the Party is now being done by Godbolds, . 3191 Barking Road.,IRISH&apos; SOCIETIES IN ENGLAND. v &apos;  .A Iranoh cf the Irish Self-Determination League is&quot; &apos;being formad at Harrow, - The object of the-League is to give practical and financial support to Sinn Fein.,       -&apos; -;&apos;A correspondent reports that the&apos;Gaelic League -is planning a campaign, of arson after the manner of.militant -suffragettes, - ...Another correspondent reports that delegates.of.the &quot; Irish American Revolutionary Party are1in London and in touoh with the Communist Party, .&apos; ...Erskine Chllders, the author.o  &quot;The.

Scotland Sinn Feiners will take place on the 27th June atGreenook, when one or two delegates from thd DublinExecutive will be present.The Sinn Fein Exeoutive are reported to be still hopingfor definite results from the agitation in Paris and Amerioa.In oonsequenoe of this, some of the leaders stronglydeprecate any outward show of violence at the present moment,and the reoent shooting outrage in Dawson Street, Dublin, isnot approved by the Irish Volunteer Headquarters.There is still a chance of a split between the Sinn FeinExeoutive and the extreme Labour Group, whioh, if it oame off,would mean a serious division between the Irish volunteers and the Citizen Army.The sentence on Madame Marklewioz has aroused no commentor agitation in Sinn Fein or Labour oiroles, in fact theadvanoed seotion of the latter may be said to be relievedthat she is out of the way, as thoy have plenty of internaldissension of their own to look after.

Theinaugural meeting was a great success and the objeots are ,r1.    To promote a national memorial to Irish efforts in the war.2.    To protect tho interests of Irishmen who have served in the war, &apos;3.
