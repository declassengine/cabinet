From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 2dlh June 1919. (Received 30th June, 11 a.m.)Clear the line.!)54 S. Secret. Afghanistan. . Your telegram of 25th June. What we want is an early peace that will make clear to Afghans and to world generally our sense of outrage at Amir&apos;s wanton aggression, bat which at the same time will not close door to establishment hereafter of friendly relations, with Afghanistan..-. For these alone can secure all we really require of Afghanistan, namely, exclusion of foreign  especially hostile foreign-infl uence(s), coupled with friendly co-operation ,on our common border. We propose, therefore, to demand amir&apos;s acceptance of,following Treaty&quot; Following Articles for restoration of peace have been agreed upon by British Government and Amir Amanulla Khan, Amir of Afghanistan and its dependencies : &quot; Article I.-From day of signing of this Treaty there shall be peace between British Government on the one part and Amir of Afghanistan on the other.&quot;Article II. In view of wanton and unprovoked aggression of Amir which has brought about present war between British Government and Afghanistan, British Government, to mark their displeasure, withdraw privilege enjoyed by former Amirs of importing arms, ammunition, or warlike munitions through India to Afghanistan.&quot;Article iii. The arrears of late amir&apos;s subsidy are furthermore confiscated, and no subsidy is granted to Amir Amanulla Khan.&quot; Article IV. At the same time British Government are desirous of re-establishment of bid friendship that has so long existed between Afghanistan and Great Britain provided they have guarantee that Amir is contrite for the past and on his part anxious to regain friendship of British Government. The British Government are prepared, therefore, provided Amir proves this by his. acts and conduct, to receive another Afghan mission after six months for discussion and settlement of matters of common interest to the two Governments and re-establishment of old friendship on satisfactory basis. ....    -. &quot; Article V.-Until the friendship has been re-established in manner indicated in last article the British troops will remain in their present positions in Afghan territory west of uiidemarcatod frontier in vicinity of Khyber where Afghan aggression took place, both as further token of displeasure of. British Government, and as safe? guard against repetition of similar aggression. The British troops now in occupation of Spin Baldak and other portions of Afghan territory will be withdrawn forthwith.&quot;Our representatives should at the same time be given discretion to present Afghan delegates with written statement of matters in which we expect Amir to give proof of his contrition and desire for friendship during probationary period of six months.   These are :. (I) That he should dismiss from his country all hostile foreigners, in particularBolshevik missions, and Bolshevik, German, or other foreign agents. (2) That he should have no relations with foreign countries, and that he should conduct his foreign relations as heretofore through us. (&apos;6) The expulsion of Obaidullah and other named Indian seditionists. (4) Genuine co-operation in keeping peace on our common border, includingremoval of outlaws and notorious raiders, and abstention from all intrigueswith our tribes directed against us. (5) The improvement of position of British agent at Kabul and of our represen-tatives in Afghanistan admitting of their (? freer) movement and freeintercourse with Afghan officials. (6) A corresponding improvement in powers and position of Afghan envoy with government of India.We believe that to deal with the situation on these lines offers the best chance of obtaining what we want in Afghanistan. If His Majesty&apos;s Government accept these proposals in principle we trust that they will leave our representatives a free hand under our orders as regards actual tactics to be employed, on the understanding that they keep us fully informed of each stage of the proceedings, which information
we should, of course, pass on without delay to His Majesty&apos;s Government. We should&apos; propose that our representatives should give Afghans a definite time limit for acceptance of Treaty. But much must depend-on the spirit in which they come. If they come in the spirit of arrogance our attitude in response would he the firmer. If, however, they evince a becoming anxiety for the renewal of friendship our representatives might informally hold out hopes that at the end of six months, should the Ainir&apos;s conduct be satisfactory, they may expect favourable terms. We feel it right, however, to strike a note of warning regarding Article V; of the draft Treaty above. It has been included in deference to the emphatic opinion of our military advisers. We recognise, however, that this Article (especially in view of the Amir&apos;s letter of 19th June, vide my telegram of the 27th June, 915 S.) may be impossible of acceptance by Amir and lead to breakdown of negotiations. Further, there are obvious political objections to the prolonged occupation of Dakka. It will act as an irritant not only on the Afghans, but on our own Afridis and Mohrnands, possibly necessitating operations against both tribes. Should His Majesty&apos;s Government share our diffidence in the matter we. should propose following alternative to Article IV.(? m&quot; The Amir accepts Indo-Afghan frontier accepted by his late father His Majesty Amir Habibulla Khan. He further agrees to the early demarcation by a British Commission of uudemarcated portion of line west of Khyber where the recent Afghan aggression took place and to accept such boundary as the British Commission may lay down. The British troops on this side will remain in their present position until such demarcation has been effected.&quot;We suggest that if this alternative is preferred our representatives should explain to the Afghan representatives that it is merely intended to lay down a frontier on this side, which can leave no doubt as to our right to Bagh spring and Torkham and&apos; give us elbow-room generally round the western mouth of the Khyber, and that there is no intention to use this as a pretext for annexation&apos;of Dakka.We have consulted Roos-Keppel, but he had not seen the above proposals. View is that to render a sudden attack on Peshawar District practically impossible we require a railhead at Dakka with broad gauge railway either by Kabul River or through Loi Shilinan and must also occupy Lalpura. These measures would close the backdoors of the Afridis and Moliniands. They would not like it, but&apos;subjugation of these tribes would in these circumstances, he thinks, be comparatively easy task. Roos-Keppel does not suggest that these measures could he. effected amicably by negotiation with Amir or accepted by Afghans as part of peace terms, and he obyfously contemplates operations against both Afridis and Molmiands as an. inevitable consequence of proposed annexation..
