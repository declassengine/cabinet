In the Midlands, and the West, there were several hours of rain of varying intensity, while in Mid-Wales, parts of the country were flooded and the cold wind and hailstorms oauged the death of several newly shorn sheep,   In the South Eastern counties the showers were inappreciable.    On Friday,&apos;the Vright sunny weather again set in, and more rain is ;needed.Winter Wheat has suffered least from the drought, but is generally short in the straw, and the prospect for the com harvest is not good,    Roots have suffered in places from attacks by fly. Haymaking has begun in some districts, but the crop is everywhere light.The reports as to fruit vary,   , Some damage was done by the gale on Thursday;   in some districts orchards have suffered severely from insect attack;   in others there is a good crop, particularly of apples and plums, exoept in the case of one or two varieties which are very light,Land Division, ,(i) Land Settlement,Applications for Small Holdings,   The following is a summary of a return obtained by the Board showing the number of applications received by Local Authorities:-Local        .

In addition; fourteen other men were accepted as probationers, but have not yet commenced v*ork.The week!y-repeats received from the Directors show that at Patringtor.-. good pa ogre?3 is being made with the thrashing of the remaining stacks6     All the cattle oat at grass are doing well and there is a good deal of !keep: due to stock being purchased late0   A noieer of store pigs have been sola to the settlers during the week, iiuch inconvenience is being caused at this Settlement by the delay on i-he part of the Poab s Committee in clearing tho hay and straw they have purchased and they are being pressed to take delivery at once,,     Wheat is making good growth, although rust is rather prevalentAt Amesbury; the winter corn is looking well in spite of the drought,     iiangolds and spring corn have suffered, whilst hay will be a light crop..

The owner of a field at Bretton Fleming, of which possession was taken by the Devon Agricultural Executive for the purpose of providing allotments,, has been fined 25 and costs for forcibly entering upon the allotments, destroying the gates and damaging the&apos;1 crops .(iii)   . Land Drainage.Durham.    Good v/ork is being done by the Executive Committee in improving the drainage of small areas, mainly by promoting co-op3ration between landowners.     Tho River Skerne and its tributaries were reported on by one of the Board1s Inspectors, and the Committee have succeeded in persuading the Doan and Chapter of Durham, the Darlington Borough Council, and others interested to adopt the measures advocated in the report.     It is hoped to achieve the removal of ail obstructions from the River Skerne without the expenditure of. any public money.     Other areas in the County are being dealt with on similar lines.     On Saitholme Marshes (1,500 acres) the Committee have induced the Ecclesiastical&apos; Commissioners, who are the principal owners, to undertake the execution of substantial impressments if the necessary labour can be found.Cumberland.     In addition to the cleansing of numerous becks in this chanty7 which has been referred to in previous reports, 1,100 yards on Wragmire Moss out of a total of 1,400 yards have been cleaned out, with good results.     The work has now had to be stopped owing to difficulties which arose regarding the accommodation of Lite prisoners guards *Yorkshire.     In the North and West Ridings in order to avoid a duplication of Committees dealing with land drainage, the Executive Commit, tees have requested the Drainage Committees to^aot as sub-committees for the exercise of the &quot;Szeeutive Committee!s powers under the Defence of the Realm Regulations relating to Land Drainage.
i i i!        93East Hiding .    preenoah Gpit^ and Bellasize Drain have been completely cleaned, and about 5,400 acres of land materially improved thereby.    The money expended is being recovered, but in certain cases legal proceedings may be necessary .    On the Karket rreighton Canal, orders 1-ere served in November, 1917 on the Trustees to rogu-lato sluices and to cleanse tho canal and subsidiary drains.     In : June, 1918 the Executive Committee tool: over the powers cf the Trustees and commenced the work of cleansing which is still proceed-ing.     It is now reported that tho condition of adjoining land is  &apos; appreciably improved.     On tho Bi shop soil Drain, Howdcn Dyke, Hus-bandraan Drain and 7i lb o r f e s s and T horn ton level, work is being carried out by the responsible drainage authorities at the instance of the Executive Committee .(iv)   Tithe, Commons, Copyhold andJ.urvey.Tho Board have consented under Section 21 of the Light Railways Act, 1896, to the taking by the Go^er leninsula light Railway Company of 27 acres of common land from various commons in the County cf Glamorgan.     The Consent contains provisions for the protection from injury of cattle grazing on the common and for tho &apos; application cf any compensation money that may be payable to the Commoners by tho Railway Company, to one or mere cf the purposes specified in the Commcnable lights Compensation Act, 1682. or  o some other purpose for tho benefit of the Commoners approved by the Board .The Board have also approved cf a rate of 1./-   per stint to bo levied upon tho owners of stints upon Crosby Garrett Common, 7/estmorland, to meet the expenses to be incurred during the current year by the Conservators cf the Common.Among the transactions completed under the Tithe Acts is an Altered Apportionment cf a corn rent amounting to . 130 . 3s. impesed by an Award dated the 27th December, 1839, which was made under the Higham terrors (Horthants) Inclosure Act, 1838.     This is cne of the very few local Inclosure Acts containing provisions fcr the commutation &amp;f tithe which were passed after the general Tithe Commutation Act, 1836.Commercial Division.Pertillsers .     The Board are in communication with the Scottish and Irish Departments with a view to the preparation of a Bill to amend the Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act.    Then a general agreement has been reached between the three Departments as to the form of the Bill, a draft will be discussed with the various trades concerned with a view to obtaining their general support.Farina.     The Treasury have now given instructions that the responsibility for the control of   the British Carina Mills shall be transferred from the ministry of Food to the Jjoard.     The British ?arina Mills Limited is a private Company with a small share capital, wto which the Government has advanced approximately 2350,000 on debentures;    this is for the purpose of enabling tho Company to build and equip four mills, three in England and one in Scotland; cf these one at Kings Lynn is working at the present time and using about 2,000 tons of potatoes per week.     Under agreement with the Company, the Government is under an agreement to produce ?arina at the ascertained cost price.     \s this cost price is now considerably abeve the market price of the Carina, there is con-siderable liability attaching to tho Government. -   -
Seed Bill.   The draft Seed Bill has been considered by the Cereal Seeds Advisory Committee and approved by that Committee in principle.   Considerable discussion took place as to the desirability of excluding cereal seeds from the scope of the Bill, mainly on the ground th&amp;t 75$ of this class of seed is sold from farmer to farmer, and in these transactions the requirements of the existing Order are frequently evaded.   It was eventually decided that cereal seeds should remain in the Bill but that the Declaration on sale should remain the same as under the existing Order and that the Grading system should not be adopted.Hprticultural Pivision,County Organisation.So far as the Board have been informed, Horticultural Sub-Committees of tho Agricultural Bducation Committees have been formed in the following counties;-Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, East and West Kent, Bast and West Suffolk, East Sussex, Somerset, Wiltshire, Yorkshire, Brecon, Carmarthenshire and Denbigh.A meeting of a preliminary Committee was attended in Devonshire, and recommendations were made as to the necessary staff to be appointed as part of the County Horticultural Staff,Shifpea,Hill.&apos; 23 men -are now being trained at the Shippea HillTraining Centre : lectures have been ^iven by the board&apos;s Technical Inspector and also a practical demonstration in making a seed-bed and seed planting by the Principal.   The man are now in much harder condition and are learning to use the different tools and ;     generally doing &quot;better work.Arrangements are nearing completion for the training of ex-service men in Horticulture and Intensive Cultivation at Birmingham, and it is hoped to make a start at an early date.Cultivation Section.The main attention of the Sections Technical Inspectors during the past week has been given to the completion of the estimates of the crops of Strawberries, Currants, Gooseberries and Raspberries.S Vv)IStrawberries.

The British Table Rabbit society have organised a scheme lio collect surplus rabbits in different parts of the country, and they have asked the Board to assist them in obtaining assistance from the Railway Companies in this respect.. The Ovraers Risk Rate which is in force for sending live poultry by rail for consumption, does not apply to rabbits, and the Society are anxious to obtain this concession for their members.Pigs. Further eases of Local Authorities ordering pig-keepers to remove their animals, aud their sties have come to the notice of the Board.Technical and Cultivation Division.Technical Section.Trials of Phosphate Fertilisers on Permanent .GraS3landt-The Technical Committee have received a report from Dr,; Russell on experiments, which have been in progress since 1916 under the auspices of the East Anglian Institute pf Agriculture, Chelmsford, for the purpose of comparing the basic slag produced in open-hearth furnaces, and certain mineral phosphates, with high grade Bessemer Slag.   On the whole, the mineral phosphates come out nearly a3 well as the slags, and there is a notable absence of superiority of the high grade over the low grade slag.
In Dr. Russell&apos;b opinion this probably arises from the presence of a second limiting factor which comes into play as soon as the shortage of phosphate is remedied.     The results naturally invite comparison with those obtained in the Saxmundham experiments, where the high soluble slag was notably superior to the low soluble slag, and if properly worked up they could doubtless throw considerable light on the problems connected with the improvement of clay land.     It is suggested that iar. Scott Robertson, who has been supervising the 7ssex experiments, should be. invited to describe and discuss his results in the Board1s Journal as soon as the present season&apos;s weighings are available.     It would be necessary, however, to obtain more than the crop yields;   certain analytical data for the soils and herbage would be needed, besides rainfall and other statistics.     Dr. Russell has expressed his willingness to afford lir. Robertson facilities for doing this work at Rothamsted during a vacation, so that he may be able to discuss his results with various members of the Rothamsted Staff.training of ex-Sorvice men.At present there are 194 men undergoing training in agricultural work at Centres established by the Board inconjunction with County Committees. The number is made up as follows:-Bois Hall Tractor School, Brentwood 107Dunston, Staffs, 5Nottingham Corporation Farm, Bulcote 45Shippea Hill, Lakenheath 25Bredbuity, Stockport 1219451 men have been placed in employment on completion oftraining. actor Section.During the week ended Hay 30th, 2557 tractors were in the hands of Committees and; 1127 of these were being operated under the new Tractor Scheme.     Of the 1430 operated by Committees directly, 473 were being got ready for sale leaving 957 available. Of these 607 (or 63$) were in commission and were idle for only 1% of the time on account of bad weather.     122 tractcis were idle through lack of work. 218 were under repair and 10 were not being worked owing to labour shortage.In England and Wales, 5251 acres were ploughed and 15,556 cultivated by 1079 tractors giving an average of 4.9 acres and 14,4 acres respectively.     The total acreage dealt with shows a decrease over the previous week of 20% in the case of ploughing and 27f in   othe case of cultivating, but the average acreage per tractor was practically unchanged.     The highest average acreage was again dealt with in: Anglesey where 21 tractors ploughed 127 acres and cultivated 730, average 6 and 35 acres respectively.The number of tractors to be retained by Committees is approximately 1400 out of 4200.

This represents f  an increase of 27 compared with the number given in the last report on the subject.     Up to tho present there has been plenty of mill, available but dairy farmers have been hesitating to take up cheese-j  Making owing to tho indefinite action of the Ministry of Food in resnect of cheese control .During tho last week there has been a noticeable falling off in milk yield conseouent on the drought which we are now experiencing.     The co-operative cheese schools in North V?ales are making marked progress.     In the Counties of ,&apos;lint and.

In one or two instances, however, in which a Candidate had already started his studies at a University or College before the Board13 award, the Scholarship has been ante-dated and the candidate refunded ,his College fees and an allowance &quot;on account&quot; made to him, pending a settlement of the precise amount of the allowance payable to him.
The Board of Education are setting up a &quot;standard local maximum&quot; allowance at each University or College centre fgr payment under their Scheme to ordinary students, and it is proposed tft :* follow this standard in the case of Agricultural Scholarship holders also - otherwise there would he invidious differences between the standard in the payment of grants by two Government Departments to students at the one and the same University.    The Board of Education are also communicating with the Treasury as to the payment of grants at the beginning instead of at the end of eaoh term.   Until the foregoing points are settled, the precise amount to be paid to the Board&apos;s Agricultural Scholarship holders cannot be definitely settled,Applications for Agricultural Scholarships are dropping off to some extent, but still continue to be received daily.Farm Training.Herefordshire County Committee have a number of farmers willing to accept &quot;officer pupils&quot; in excess $f candidates for training in that County.

PART II. - OTHgR DIVISIONS-Animals Division.Swine-fever - 72 outbreaks, 262 reports.Anthrax - 3 outbreaks, 31 reports.Glanders - 1 case.Sheep Scab - 18 cases.The number of outbreaks of Rabies confirmed has been 4, one in each of the counties of iionmouth, Middlesex, Glamorgan and Surrey and the number of reports of suspected cases has been 29.Orders have been issued to-day imposing special restrictions in two small areas around Plymouth and Abergavenny.Rats Orders,.In January last the attention of the Army medical Department was called by us to the prevalence of rats in Military Camps and Establishments and their co-operation invited.   On the 17th April, complaint having been made to the Board that the Military Hospital at Liverpool was over-run with rats, the &quot;ar Office was informed of this and also of complaints received from-Local Authorities of the increase in the numbers of rats attributable to &quot;iviilitary Camps.   It was pointed out that more effective measures were needed especially in those camps which were about to be broken up and from which it was to be expected that there would be a wholesale dispersal of rats seeking for food elsewhere. As these Military Camps lay outside the jurisdiction of the Local Authorities a request was made that the attention of all Officers concerned might be drawn to tbe matter, in order that effective measures might be taken to secure the destruction of rats.   It appears, however, that the Officers of the Army Medical Department are hampered in their efforts to deal effectively with the destruction of rats ov/ing first to the fact that they have not got the men to do the work, and secondly no provision is made for their obtaining poisons or other material necessary for the purpose.At the request of the Sanitary Officer of the Southern Command, Mr. Read visited Hetley Hospital.on Friday last to advise as to the best means of dealing with the plague of rats which exists there. It would appear from his report (on G. 144/19) that the conditions prevailing at Hetley are as bad, if not worse, than those recently reported at the London County Council Asylum, Ilorton,   The following is an extract from his report: *&quot;The rut plague originated in a huge refuse tip weighing thousands of tons, the accumulation&apos; of 50 years.   On the far side of this tip is a terrain covered with shrubs, grasses and a wet ditch, with banks which contain the original rat burrows.   The tip is situate some 300 yards from the original Net-ley Hospital which is to a large extent rat proof.   Between the tip and the main building are a number of hutments, galvanised iron on raised foundations, in which part of the nursing staff are housed.   The space between the earth and the foundations afford the rats shelter and a means of obtaining access to the interior of the huts by gnawing through the fibrous walls.   I was informed that it was impossible to keep the rats out of the buildings by repairing the holes they gnawed, because if these repairs were carried out fresh holes were made within 24 hours.   They enter the huts to get at the food in the kitchen and larder.   The same conditions apply to the isolation huts close by.   The Red Cross and Welsh Hospitals, temporary hutments are also infested.   The Officers&apos; liess at the far end of the main building are also badly rat infested.   This
?his briefly conveys an idea of the situation generally&quot; .Sir Edward Clarke,who has been enquiring into the matter and i.as   seen the Southern Command Authorities is of opinion that unless the ^vision and Brigade Commanders receive definite instructions to assist the Army medical and Sanitary Officers in this work the latter cannot do anything very effective.Veterinary department??troonb.Swine fever material was examined in 110 reported outbreaks.

One or two serve special mention.   Two quite separate parties of Russian piculWrists have come to the Department during the week for assistance their study of agriculture in England.   One is connected with the ssian National Committee (14, Austin Friars, S.C.2), the other with ie agricultural Co-operative Societies of the region of Odessa.

Proceedings wore taken against an employer * at&apos; &quot;floleshiirrWarwiokshire,&apos; on June 11, in respect of the under-payment of several of his workers,,   Tho under-pay me nt continued after the matter had been brought to the enployefs notice, and he refused to pay the arrears of wages.   The defendant was fined  6, and ordered to pay 15 guineas costs and arrears of wages amounting to  28. 9s. on three summoisas; three other cases were dismissed as the Bench did not consider that the workers were employed in agriculture.An employer in Essex was summoned at Grays on the 13th June for under-payment of one worker in respect of overtime. The Inspector who visited reported that the employer, his son, and the worker agreed as to hours worked, etc., and on this basis there were considerable arrears due.   At the hearing of the case, the employer and his son denied any such agreement, and the worker admitted he was sometimes late and sometimes did not present himself for v/ork.   The Bench decided there was not sufficient evidence to convict.An employer in Sussex was summoned at Midhurst, on June 12th, in respect of the under-payment of a worker employed by him as a carter.   An Inspector had visited in December, 1918, and had found two workers underpaid, and the case had been settled by the payment of arrears of wages by the employer.   On a further visit by the Inspector, the carter was found still to be underpaid.   The dependant was convicted and fined  2, ordered to pay  3. 8. 0. costs, and    arrears of wages amounting to  4. 15. 0.During the week 48 cases of complaint of non-payment of the minimum rates were received, the largest number from a single county being 6 in the case of Kent, Somerset and Suffolk.

As this area comprises 500 acres cf the best strip of reclaimable foreshore, on which the Board could set 300 men to work within a short time, the Ministry of Labour is being approached, in order that they may urge upon the Air Ministry the importanoe of the Board acquiring this particular area.Huts.   16 huts are now erected for housing the workmen to bo employed on the works.
A camp at Saltfleet-has been inspected, and utility buildings, ablution sheds etc, havo been selected, and purchased for removal and re-erection.Labour,   36 men are now employed on the preliminary work. Authority to employ more men in order to commence work has been temporarily withheld.Sewage.   The new system of producing a synthetic &quot;farm yard&quot; manure by means of treating straw with sewage is about to be tried on a fairly large scale at the land reclamation &quot;village&quot; at Wainfleet.     The Chief Engineer has been assured by Lr, Hutchinson and Mr. Richards of RothamstedJ that the sewage from the village could satisfactorily be dealt with by the new method without nuisance.    The capital cost involved is less than that of filter beds.     If satisfactory arrangements with farmers for the supply of straw in return for manure can be made, the new system of sewage disposal may prove to be very inexpensive to maintain.    As the district is an arable one, it is expected that the 400 tons or so of straw that will be required for dealing with the sewage of the village during twelve months will be easily available.    Por the same reason the manure should find a ready market.     It is hoped to make arrangements with a number of farmers within carting radius of the village to supply the straw required in return for the manure into which it will be converted.The structural details of a suitable straw filter have been worked out by the Chief Engineer in collaboration with Dr. Hutchinson and Mr. Richards, based upon capacities determined experimentally at Rothamstedv.      The design will be discussed finally on the site at Wainfleet with the Resident Engineer, and construction put in hand immediately.Perth, Cardiganshire.The working out of levels, tidal obseivations etc. ta^en, by the Ordnance Survey has been completed.    A general scheme has &apos;&apos; been drawn up by the Chief Engineer.Irrigation of Light Lands,The report of Captain Tillard, who was specially commissioned to enquire into the practicability of the irrigation of light land has been received and is being considered.Secretary,18th June, 1919,
