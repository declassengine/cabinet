M, Furst.The task entrusted to the Committee of Experts was to examine the measures of &quot;productive guarantees&quot;rproposed, by Monsieur Poincare, the Prime Minister of France; at the Meeting of the 7th August and to study their financial bearing.- and the amount which they would yield, in comparison with other resources. Is        .Control by an Inter-allied Commission .of tho grant of import and export licenses;for goods entering or going from the occupied Rhine-land Territories,
This measure was&apos;not intended to produce any cash and accordingly calls for no observations from the Committee of Experts.II, ,   Exploitation and possible transfer of State ;linos and State Forests- ,(a) State Hino3.      The nines in question are the mines in the Ruhr belonging to the Prussian Stato...    The output of these mines is about 9 million tons a year..It was admitted that the exploitation of these mines by the Allies would not result in any increase in the output&apos;of coal in Germany and that consequently it would not increp.se Germany&apos;s capacity to pay,;but the Italian and Belgian delegates were of opinion that the French proposal might constitute a means of ensuring a more reliable execution of tho coal deliveries prescribed by the Reparation Commission, since the mines, which would be worked under the/control A,.
control of the Allies produce about 50% of the quantity of the coal deliverable under the decisions of the Reparation Goimissions,On the question as to whether it would be practicable for the.Allies to take control ofthese State mines, the French and Belgian delegates thought that it would be practicable to carry out such operations without undue cost*     On the other hand the Italian delegate was of the view that the Allies should not take control of the State mines hut that the Reparation-Commission should set Up, on the basis of Article 248 of the Treaty of Versailles, some other system whereby a sufficient guarantee might be obtained for the deliveries of the coal which the Germans were under obligation to send to the Allies. The Japanese delegate was of the opinion that the matter required further investigation and that It should be referred to the Reparation Commission to decide whether the operation of the State mines by the Allies was practicable.     The British delegate was of the opinion that the operation of the Ruhr State mines by the Allies was entirely impracticable; that it would be more difficult to induce the German miners to work the mines successfully under the management of the Allies than under their own system, and that such an attempt on the part of the Allies would Inevitably end in reducing production.If the alienation    of the State mines should be contemplated, that is to say the transfer of the property In them to the Reparation Commission, the capital value might.be of the order of magnitude of 400 million gold marks-) but it is impossible to say/ wha t

The &apos; British--experts were of opiu-ioi.    that sfiy such sale would be very difficult to effect,  that it would neeee-sr-artry bring in only paper mo r,ks, and that it could not be regarded as a- finaneiaIguarantee of any importance.  &apos; Tbe French delegate, again observed that the proposal Would fulfil the object which the French Government have in View, i *e . it would constitute an&apos; asset which- would be at the disposal, of the Allies in case of default by Germany in the fulfilment of her obligations,(b)        -State forests,.  Although the British representatives considered, that timber deliveries from Germany could never be regarded as being in principle, economically sound, the Committee of Experts unanimously agreed that the delivery of timber on Reparation Account was n delivery which the German Government could carry out with comparative ease and with the minimum burden on the German budget,  iri - view of the fact that a large proportion of the German torests are the property of the German StatesAlthough the question of timber deliveries was not directly submitted to the Committee, the Committee was unanimous in proposing to call t^e attention of the Reparation Commission to the quest-ion.The French delegation considered it necessary to take efficacious measures to place at the disposal of the Reparation Commission the State forests, both to ensure the full delivery to the Allied countries of the timber for which, they have asked, and. which the Reparation Commission has considered that Germany can deliver, and in addition to constitute a guarantee.The other delegation considered that the difficulties of realising the State mines applied with even greater force to the forests, and they Fere therefore of opinion that these forests could be regarded rather as a guarantee for the timber deliveries than a financial /g-u*rsartese-*^-
guarantee, the capital value of which could he realised.III. Fact cries on ,the::,lei t ;ha nk of the Rh in e .It was&apos; stated the t he for.? the War the capital invested in these factories&apos; a; -oiihtod to a total of 1 milliard gold marks.      If 605 of this capital accordingly was expropriated for the benefit of the Allies the value of the shares obtained would nominally be 600 Trillion gold marks.The British, Italian, Japanese and Belgian delegates were of opinion that as the German Government would have to indemnify the holders of these securities which would involve an expenditure of 70 milliards offt &apos;   \paper marks at the present rate of exchange,  this would have the effect of weakening the financial position Of the German Government and still further depreciating the mark and that accordingly this suggestion was in present circumstances impracticable.The French Delegation Indicated that if it obtained sufficient guarantees by -the application ofother measures proposed bv Monsieur poincare it would be able to fall in with the views of the majority on this question.IV, Colloction of Customs on the Western Frontier of Germany (left, bank of the Rhine), establishment of a Customs barriermon the Rhine and of export taxes in the Ruhr district.(a)      Goil action of Customs on the We?tern Frontier of Germany.The total of the paper marks obtained during the six months during/, which. ...
which this measure&apos;&apos;-&apos;was-^in^.:fo^ millions ^paper-roar ks which at the average rate of exchange of the year would he equal to about 58,000,000 gold marks, while the cost of the Allied control was only 29,000,000 paper marks.It is worthy of note, however, that during the last month, in which the system was In force, i.e. September, 1921, the receipts amounted to 16* million, gold marks.The Experts, with the exception of the French Representative, recognised that the control of the collection of these Customs formed part of the question of the control of the collection of the customs of Germany as a whole, provided for in the Schedule of Payments, and that it was not necessary to deal with the collection of these -particular customs separately0     The question of the collection of Customs duties Is dealt   with below9The French Representative observed on the contrary that the control by the Allies of the Rhine Customs enabled the Allies to obtain an important asset and they considered that it is impossible to disassociate the control of the Customs on the Western Frontier of Germany from the question of the proposed Customs line on tho Rhino,Cb)   Customs Frontier to be established on the RhineoThe French Experts remarked that during the last 5 months during which a special Customs system was established for the left bank of the Rhine (I.e. July, August and September, 1921) 20% of the Customs receipts came from the Customs houses established along the Rhine, being an amount of 145 million paper marks which are still in the hands of the R e par a 11 on C ormii s s 1 on.The British, Italian, Japanese and Belgian Experts were of the opinion that the institution of a Customs-5** /Frontier
Frontier in the interior of Germany would be liable to result in serious embarrassment of Germany&apos;s economic life, and that it was rather a measure of compulsion,, having consequently only a provisional character and being such as would not easily form a security for an important financial operation.(cj Installation of a Customs Ring round the Basin of the Ruhr.The French Experts stated that the establishment of Customs posts at the points of exit from the Ruhr had especially as its object the collection of taxes on the exportation of goods from the Ruhr basin (principally coal, metallurgical products, etc)     They stated that the&apos; value of the metallurgical products from the Ruhr basin amounted to about 578 milliards of paper marks so that the collection of an export tax of only about 5% on these products could realise a quantity of paper marks corresponding to several hundred million gold marks.The British, Italian, Japanese and Belgian Experts were of opinion that the application of this measure of guarantee could not be confcestlsl&amp;fcsd as a step actually to be taken In&apos;view of the present situation in regard to the payments demanded from Germany and having regard to&apos; the fact that the establishment of a special Customs line around the Ruhr basin would seriously embarrass Germany&apos;s economic life, and consequently decrease her capacity to pay reparation.The French Delegate on the contrary was of the opinion that in view of the Influence which such a measure might exercise on the large industrials of the Ruhr basin who possess an enormous influence over the German Government, the actualorganisation/
^organis at ion of this form of guarantee would- make it poss Die to obtain an Important security which would, &quot;be Bu&amp;ceptible of further. development and which might have a favourable&apos; influence over the disposition of Germany in regard&apos;to the Treaty of Peace,&quot;        Exi7orti Levy and Collect ion of Custom?^   .j . It was pointed out that the Committee of Guarantees appointed by the Reparation Commission under the Schedule of payments of Hay 1921 had already the right to take certain guarantees.In the first place it had the right to require payment to it of the produoe of all Customs and export duties collected not only in the Rhineland but at all the frontiers of Germany,   This payment had actually been effected-by the German Government from October 1921 to January 1922 and had only been suspended owin-s; to the grant of the moratorium at Cannes.   The yield from this aouroe amounted to about 1,700 million paper marks per month which was equivalent to nearly 300 million gold marks per annum,   The Committee of Guarantees still controlled the collection of these revenues and could. If necessary, exercise its right to payment without any friction or difficulties,In the second place, the Committee of Guarantees had a right to a levy of 25^ on the value of all German exg-orts, to be paid in gold or foreign current ciese   In pursuance of this provision, German exporters were required tc hand over to the Reiehsbank (against payment in paper marks) a. proportion of their foreign bills .   This had yielded in recent months over
100 ^million :g-old marks aria, . the, German Government had agreedthat these bills should he.held&apos; for the account of.theCommittee of Guarantees up- to the- amount, due,, for payment to the Reparation Commission each month,,, the balance being released for the durrent. heeds; of&apos; the-German Government...It was pointed out that the arrangement leavesthe Reparation C6mmission to decide whether these billscan be applied&apos;,  In&apos;existing&apos;circumstances,, to reparationsor not,, but&apos; these two resources,give a total of about million,500/gold marks per annum,, paid for the most part in foreign currencies&apos; which more than covers the total obligations at present prescribed for the current year,.x x x x x XXIn&apos; conclusion the Committee unanimously agreed, that the receipts already under control of the- Committee of Guarantees&apos;,, viz;- the Customs revenues.&apos; and the export levy would constitute excellent resources for the.Allied Governments if their -proceeds- were paid to. accounts In the name of the Committee of GuaranteesThe French Delegation ovserved :that the application of the two measures referred to above had been requested by Monsieur Poincare and offered assured advantages..      It considers, however, that these measures could not be can-sidered as sufficient.   - - The proposals of Monsieur Poincare must not be considered from the point of view only of their present financial yield., but from the. point of view also of the guarantees they provide in the event of ill:will on the part of Germany...    In this connexion the French Delegation pointed out that these proposals as compared with those, contemplated above, offered the: decided advantages -/ (a)/
j -    23.9(a) that they create during the continuance of a moratorium a means of securing payment *&quot;ich would be available in case of need, and would produce the best results if Germany failed to execute the reforms required of her;(b) that they place in the hands of the Allies German assets which could immediately be made to produce revenue and could ultimately be realised..The British, Italian, Japanese and Belgian Delegates, on the contrary, took the view that the alternative guarantees proposed by Monsieur Poincare were superfluous in so far as they were intended as security for the cash payments now required, and that the disad-vantages they Involved more than outweighed the value of the proceeds which might be obtained from them. These proceeds would be paper mark proceeds, the realisation of which would present difficulties whereas the export bills represent sums in foreign currencies.Treasury,9th August, 1922,- 9 -
