i^J^-^JPfo.Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government 1 ^  vc &quot; -   ----- --     - - -OP     4191    I    I Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1922. - a&quot;&apos;::^^eN&apos;FIDEN TIAL.CONFERENCE ON INTER-ALLIED DEBTS AND REPARATIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IT was decided at the Cabinet on the 7th September that the Treasury should submit to me a draft reply to M. Poincare&apos;s contentious and disagreeable note, and that I should then advise the Cabinet.The Treasury draft when it reached me appeared to contain a good deal of valuable matter and well-put argument. While accepting the substance I have revised it in certain particulars and now circulate it to my colleagues.But at the same time I strongly advise against&apos; its being sent at the present moment. Our sole chance of success in the exceedingly difficult situation which confronts us in the Near East appears to lie in our keeping France in line, and in my being able to come to some sort of agreement with M. Poincare. At such a moment, to send him a polemical reply, however thoroughly justified, and perhaps in the long run necessary, would, in my opinion, be unwise; and the ease with which we should score off him would, while gratifying to our own self-respect, possibly not improve his temper.An opportunity of escape from this situation has been provided by the receipt of a note from the Belgian Government which is confined exclusively to the question, of the proposed conference to deal with debts and reparations, and asks.our opinion upon the French proposal.I suggest that we should reply to the Belgian Government that we also have received from the French Government a suggestion that a fresh conference should be called and then continue somewhat on the lines of paragraphs 4 and 5 of the draft reply to the French. We could then simultaneously write to the French informing them that we have received this note from the Belgians and that we are answering them on those lines. We might add that in the circumstances we consider it more expedient to make no answer to the various contentious points which the French note contains, but that our silence must not be regarded as acquiescence in certain of the contentions and statements advanced in that note with many of which we are in emphatic disagreement and which, at a more opportune moment, we shall find it necessary to contest.C. of K.September 17, 1922.The Marquess Gurzon of Kedleston to Lord Hardinge (Paris).(No.      .)My Lord, Foreign Office, September    , 1922.I have received your despatch No. 2047 enclosing a copy of the answer of the French Government to Lord Balfours note of the 1st August upon inter-Allied indebtedness and kindred matters.2. The inclination of His Majesty&apos;s Government would have been to refrain from sending any reply to M. Poincare&apos;s note, certain portions of which appear to them hardly to rise to the level of the important subject now under discussion, and which they are loth to believe that the French Government can have intended to regard as a r^ serious contribution to the settlement of the case. If each note that is exchanged ImJ between our two friendly and Allied Governments is to be made the subject of reply and counter-reply there would be opened a prospect of endless correspondence, unlikely to serve any useful purpose or to lead to definite results.3. On the other hand, the nature of the French note is such as to render a reply upon certain points an obligation of duty as well as of courtesy, and upon these I will now endeavour to state the views that are held by His Majesty&apos;s Government.4.  His Majesty&apos;s   Government  are  in  complete  agreement with the French[8894] b
Government that the two problems of German reparation and inter-Allied debt cannot be satisfactorily dealt with until they have been subjected to examination together by a conference at which all the Allied Governments interested are without exception represented. It was because the Allies were not all represented at the last London Conference that His Majesty&apos;s Government considered it undesirable to undertake a discussion of those two problems in relation to each other at that gathering ; and they would regard as premature any conference intended to raise the subject of inter-Allied indebtedness until such time as all the interested. Allied Governments are fully prepared to participate.5. His Majesty&apos;s Government take this opportunity of recalling to mind that, at the meeting of the recent London Conference on the morning of the 1.4th August, certain definite proposals were put forward by Mr. Lloyd George; these included the suggestions (I) that the conference should adjourn until the return from America of the various Allied missions shortly proceeding there to discuss the- funding of the respective Allied debts to the United States, and (2) that during the interval no demands should be made for payment of interest on these debts. To these suggestions His Majesty&apos;s Government still adhere, despite the fact that M. poincare did not at the moment see his way to accepting them. Subject to the conditions formulated by Mr. Lloyd George on the 14th August, they therefore welcome the suggestion that the whole matter should, within the near future, be examined by a fresh conference, such as that specified in the fourth paragraph of M. Poincare&quot;s note.6. His Majesty&apos;s Government also accept, without reserve, M Poincares contention that no comparison is justifiable between Germany&apos;s obligation to repair the material damage which, she wrought and the debts contracted between the Allies themselves in defeating Germany s armed assault upon treaty faith and the framework of European peace. In their opinion, the Allies are entitled to claim from Germany the utmost she can pay, and every ally has an equal moral right to German reparation in the propor-tions upon which they have mutually agreed. His Majesty&apos;s Government have acted upon this principle with absolute consistency, and they stand by it no less firmly now. The alleviations recommended from time to time by the Reparation Commission in accordance with its duty under the Treaty of Versailles have been accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government, not in the interest of Germany, but in the common interest of the Allies. They desire even more keenly that the devastated regions of France should be repaired than they claim the reparation due to themselves ; and if in Lord Balfours note they suggested that in certain circumstances they would be prepared to forgo their own claim upon Germany, they did so, not only from a general regard for European stability, which is threatened by the collapse of the-exchanges, but also having in view, in particular, that the payment of reparations to France and the other Allies would thus be rendered more feasible and more certain.7. His Majesty&apos;s Government would have preferred to pass over in silence any invidious comparisons as to the moral position of the various, countries in the matter of inter-Allied indebtedness, and to avoid all reference to the burdens imposed upon their respective nationals. But their view being as explained in the preceding paragraphs, they cannot in equity accept the suggestion, which is often heard, that Britain should pay twice over for any alleviations conceded to Germany should pay, that is, not only by renouncing her own share of German reparation, but also by remitting all claims upon their Allies. The British national, whose losses in ships and cargoes alone during the war amounted respectively to 618,000,OOOZ. and 136,000,OOOL, or a total of 754,000,0001., will be making an already heavy sacrifice if he renounces his claim on German)&apos;&apos; for reparation in cash, with the result that the larger claims of France will be more fully met ; but he can hardly be expected, in addition to this sacrifice, to regard himself as liable from his own pocket for such part of his Allies&apos; claims on Germany as Germany herself may be unable to meet. His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to treat the question of inter-Allied indebtedness with the fullest regard for justice, friend-ship and the exalted common cause in which those debts were incurred ; but they cannot accept any collocation of German reparation and inter-Allied indebtedness as comparable matters to be dealt with in a single account.8. In the latter part of M. Poincare&apos;s note reference is made to a matter so trivial that His Majesty&apos;s Government would have preferred to leave any discussion of the subject, if such were required, to the experts of our two countries when once the general principle had been laid down. But as it&apos;appears to be insinuated that in certain matters of accountancy His Majesty&apos;s Government have been less liberal than were the French Government, it is necessary to state briefly and explicitly the actual facts. They are these : So far as concerns the method of computation used, in fixing the French debt to
(No. 3332.) (Translation.)My Lord, Belgian Embassy, London, September 13, 1922.The French Charge d&apos;Affaires at Brussels, acting on instructions from M. Poincare, asked M. Jaspar whether Belgium intended to summon a conference to deal in its entirety with the questions of (1) Preparations, (2) Inter-Allied Debts, (3) the International Loan.M. Jannez mentioned that, in M. Poincare&apos;s opinion, all the interested Powers should take part in this assembly, including the States of the Little Entente and Poland, but that ex-enemy Powers should be excluded from it.This suggestion of the French Government is in continuance of the project taken into consideration at the recent conference in London.My Government have instructed me to ask your Lordship to be so good as to inform me whether His Majesty&apos;s Government agree (1) as to the idea of summoning-Great Britain, no export duties were charged by the British authorities ; all material was supplied for the bare cost; the British Quartermaster-General paid at a higher rate than his French colleague for material supplied to the British forces in France. Moreover, these matters have already been adjusted between the French and British experts, and ought not now to be made the subject of public discussion with results that can only impair the memories of common action and common suffering in an identical cause.9. His M;majesty&apos;s Government note the distinction which the French Government seek to draw between the moral obligation of France&apos;s debt to the United States of America and France&apos;s debt to Great Britain. This appears to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to open the door to a particularly undesirable and invidious form of discussion, which they would desire at all costs to avoid. If, however, debts are to be weighed in the scales of sentiment -a process from which they themselves, as Lord Balfour stated, are not averse they find it strange that the measure of obligation admitted by France, to Great Britain should be reckoned in inverse proportion not only to the closeness of their- national interests as European Powers, but also to the length of their association as comrades in arms and the amount of Britain&apos;s sacrifices for their common victory. Britain does not yield to France in admiration for the spirit which brought the American pp-ople into a European war across many miles of ocean ; but in justice to the peoples of the British Empire His Majesty&apos;s Government are entitled to point out that Canada, the nearest to Europe of all the British dominions which sent their sons to France from the very first declaration of war, is geographically as remote from European interests and responsibilities as the United States, and that the other great dominions are even more distant.10. For the troops of Britain, moreover, as much as for the troops from the Dominions overseas, the European war was never a war in defence of their own soil. The soil of Britain was defended by the Iloyal Navy; and though a very large part of that navy was occupied in service elsewhere, the rampart of the navy proved entirely adequate to maintain the inviolability of the British coast from foreign invasion. From the first week of war the British peoples in Europe and overseas sprang to the defence of French and Belgian soil, because they believed the French and Belgian cause to be the cause of right. To disparage the motives which inspired that world-wide and instantaneous movement of British sentiment cannot be helpful to the continued and essential friendship of the British Empire and France.11. His Majesty&apos;s Government have already declared their intention of funding and disposing of Britain&apos;s debt to the United States. Great Britain and the United States will thus be joint creditors to the European Allies for almost equal amounts. Having funded her own debt to the United States, Great Britain cannot in equity admit that her claims upon her debtors are any less strong than those of the other great creditor Governments. On the contrary, she must, in justice to her own people, insist that the principles of settlement adopted for the debts owed by France and the other European Allies to the United States shall govern equally the debts owed by France and the other European Allies to herself. But, as stated in an earlier passage, His Majesty&apos;s Government reaffirm their readiness, when the moment is opportune, to join the French and other interested Governments in submitting the whole question to full and careful examination by a further conference.12. Your Lordship should read this despatch to M. Pomcare&quot; and hand to his Excellency the enclosed copy.
a conference ; (2) as to the programme of this Assembly (the Belgian Government regard it as important that the questions to be taken into consideration should be strictly delimited, and that the programme of the conference be definitely decided so as to avoid any difficulties or surprises later) ; (3) as to the admission of representatives of the Little Entente and of Poland, as suggested by M. Poincare ; (4) as to the exclusion of representatives of ex-enemy Powers, as the President of the French Conseil desires.I have, &amp;c.P. le TELLIER
