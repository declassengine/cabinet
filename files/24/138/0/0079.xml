In July last the Home Secretary laid before the Cabinet proposals for tightening the control of sales of arms and ammunition by the Disposals Board from surplus war stores. These proposals were the outcome of a Conference^ence convened by the Home Office, at which it appeared that in one or two recent cases firearms thus disposed of had reached undesirable hands. The question was considered by the Cabinet on 20th July, when it was decided (Cabinet 40 (22), conclusion 7) (a) That the Disposal Board should be instructed to refrain from selling any moremunitions pending further instructions ;(b) That the Service Departments should take steps to break up unserviceable armsand ammunition, whether surplus or not ;(c) That serviceable arms and ammunition should be retained.Later, at a conference of interested Departments at the Treasury on 4th August, it was agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the following interpretation should be placed on the Cabinet decision above quoted : (a) Gun ammunition. The existing procedure, by which the Disposal Board strictlysupervises its breaking down, should continue. (&amp;) Small arms ammunition. Sales of intact ammunition to be strictly confined to dominion and Indian Governments. ((-) Small arms. No further declarations of surplus to be made by the War Officewithout Cabinet authority.   Serviceable rifles to be disposed of only to theDominion or Indian Governments.2. The terms, of this Cabinet decision are, however, preventing the completion of certain negotiations with bona fide armament firms in this country for the supply of arms and ammunition to allied and other governments.I quote two such cases in detail : (a) The War Department was approached towards the end of last year by Messrs. Vickers for the supply of quantities of three types of small-arms ammunition required by the Japanese and Dutch Governments.   These were (i) S.P.G. tracer-384,000 rounds.(ii) Armour piercing 240,000 rounds.(iii) Buckingham incendiary 290,000 rounds.Vickers were informed that the first could be supplied by the Disposals Board, from stocks held by the Air Ministry. With regard to the second, the War Department undertook to manufacture the quantity required, but on terms which have not as yet been accepted by Vickers. On the strength of these negotiations, - however, the firm made contracts with the Japanese Government for supply. For the Buckingham ammunition they have as yet no contract, but have received enquiries from the Japanese and Dutch Governments for the quantities quoted above. The Dutch are also enquiring for a further 50,000 rounds of S.P.G. tracer ammunition.Vickers are, therefore, counting upon our undertaking to supply this ammunition, and their position will be a difficult one if these negotiations are rendered nugatory by the decision of the Cabinet.(b) The B.S.A. Company are negotiating for the supply of 600,000 pattern 1914 rifles to the Serbian Government. The Disposals Board can. supply only 62,000 of these rifles, and the B.S.A. company^ approached the War Department for the remainder.   The
War Department hold at present some :\ million rifles as war reserves, of which about 800,000 ai-e of the pattern Serbia would take. This reserve figure is in excess of the general basis on 1 which we are keeping reserve stores, but was approved last winter by the Cabinet, since the alternative course was to break up good arms. The B.S.A. Company have offered to manufacture for us modern pattern rifles in payment for the 600,000 pattern 1914 arms, on an approximate basis of one new rifle for every two of the old pattern, and it is probable that we could obtain a considerable portion of the payment in cash, as well as in kind by the manufacture of new rifles for old. Moreover, I am advised that, from the point of view of efficiency, the advantage lies in the possession of the fewer rifles of the latest pattern. The deal has also much to recommend it on the ground of the employment to be provided by the manufacture of the new rifles, both by the B.S.A. Company and by Government factories which would share the work.&apos; 3. I share the desire to prevent arms and ammunition from our surplus stocks getting to destinations in Russia, Afghanistan, Ireland or elsewhere where they may easily prove a danger to the peace of the Empire. But I think that the necessary degree of control can he achieved by methods which will prove easier to work in practice than will strict adherence to the terms of the decision of 20th July, which, as I have shown, not only prevents our honouring previous undertakings to armament firms, but also hinders our taking advantage of favourable opportunities for improving our reserve stocks without additional cost to the country.I ask the Cabinet to allow the responsibility for giving effect to the policy of the Cabinet in the matter of sales of warlike stores to rest upon the Departments concerned, who will exercise their discretion in referring the more important questions concerning the sale of arms to the Cabinet. I accordingly propose to act in this way unless there is any objection on the part of my colleagues.L. W.-E.The War Office,5th September, 1922. ,
