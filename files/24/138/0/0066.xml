This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.3SECRET.CP. 4165.THE CABINET.REPORT ON THE SITUATION IN IRELAND FOR THE WEEKENDING 12th AUGUST, 1922.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate the report on the Irish situation by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Ireland, for the week ending 12th August.L. W.-E.The Was Office,22nd August, 1922.Southern Ireland.Dublin. -The most important event this week has been the death from heart failure of Mr. Arthur Griffith. This took place at 10 a.m. on 12th August in a nursing home in Dublin. The funeral will take place on the morning of 16th August. The loss of Arthur Griffith at this juncture may have serious consequences. He was trusted and respected by all parties. It cannot be said that General Michael Collins is trusted by either his friends or his enemies.Alderman Cosgrove, who is dependable, and who is a man of some experience, especially in local authority finance, was appointed acting Chairman to the Provisional Government on the day when Michael Collins took to himself the position of Commander-in-Chief and the rank of General.Whether there was any direct connection between the incidents is difficult to say, but on the afternoon and evening of 10th A.ugust, following on the execution that morning in London of the murderers of Sir Henry Wilson, three different cases of attacks on British soldiers took place in the streets of Dublin. A lorry-load of British, soldiers proceeding on leave came into Dublin about 5 p.m., and when near the North Circular Road was fired on by three or four civilians from the doorway of a public house.. The fire was promptly returned by a small armed escort on the lorry. There were no casualties amongst the soldiers ; but a jarvey driver who happened to be in the line of fire was seriously wounded by a rifle bullet fired from the lorry. The civilian attackers escaped through the back of the public house. Later in the evening two cases occurred of single British soldiers being fired on by civilians with revolvers, but no one was hurt.. These incidents have been reported to the Provisional Government,, as was also the case of another lorry returning with British soldiers to Collinstown late on 13th August, when three or four shots were fired at it in the dark. Again there were no casualties on either side.Shots are heard every night in Dublin. The Provisional Government posts at Dolphin&apos;s Barn and the Four Courts Hotel appear to come in for most of the Republicans&apos; attention, and on the night of 12th August two Provisional Government soldiers were wounded at the latter place. -The Provisional Government had intended to take over Dublin Castle to-day, and of&quot; the 280 Royal Irish Constabulary there waiting disbandment, , 180 left yesterday (14th. August) ; but yesterday evening the news from Dundalk, together with the necessity for sending reinforcements to Drogheda, and the fact that Provisional Government troops were required for lining the streets for Mr. Griffiths funeral, induced the Provisional Government authorities to ask for a few days&apos; grace. This request has-been acceded to, and arrangements have been made to postpone the handing over of the
Castle until 17th August. Some 80 of the Royal Irish Constabulary garrison have volunteered to stay on till that date, and a company of British infantry was sent to the Castle this morning to act as a reserve.The Roj^al Irish Constabulary depot at Gormanstown is being handed over to the Provisional Government this week ; but the situation to the north of Drogheda mav affect this arrangement.General Michael Collins is reported to be visiting the Provisional Government troops in the south-west.Outside Dublin.  The chief event of the past week, on the military side, was. the relief of Cork city on 10th August. At daybreak on 8th August, Provisional Government troops, under Major-General J. E. Dalton (late chief liaison officer in Dubin and Officer Commanding, Eastern District appointments are changed with bewildering rapidity in these days) were landed at Youghall, Passage West (on the opposite side of the River Lee to Queenstown), and at Unionhall, an inlet near Skibbereen. The landings at Youghall and Unionhall were minor affairs, and were successful; there.was practically no opposition, and the Unionhall detachment of Provisional Government troops occupied Skibbereen. It is understood that three shiploads of troops were landed at Passage West, Dalton having his headquarters on the s.s. &quot;Arvonia,&quot; of the London and North-Western Railway Company. Dalton&apos;s main body had some considerable opposition to deal with, and a civilian eye-witness reports that 700 Republicans opposed the advance of the Provisional Government troops, by land, in the area south of the villages of Rochestown and Douglas. There was fighting south of Cork city on the evening of 8th August and all day 9th August, the National troops having some 7 killed and many wounded (so it is reported) and the Republicans 6 killed, 20 wounded and 50 prisoners. The Republicans retreated westward and northward through Cork city, setting fire, before they left, to all military and police barracks and to Government House (late residence of General Officer Commanding, 6th Division). The three bridges over the River Lee, in Cork, were also partially or totally destroyed.It is reported that the Provisional Government troops received a very warm welcome on entering the town, especially from the young ladies, whose embraces considerably delayed the pursuit of the enemy ; since 10th August, Cork has resumed its normal aspect ; but unemployment will be prevalent for some considerable time, and all railway communications near the city have been destroyed by the Republicans.Dalton&apos;s headquarters are now in Cork, and it is understood that a large number of spare rifles were taken with the expedition, with which to arm ex-soldiers and other supporters of the Provisional Government. Certain obstructions in the River Lee were removed, with the assistance of the Navy, and shipping services have now been resumed.Parties of Republicans continue to remain in and near Queenstown, during the fighting for Cork, and these men set fire to Admiralty House, the military hospital (much wanted by the inhabitants for their own use as an hospital) and Belmont hutted camp.On 12th August, however, Provisional Government troops, from Cork, were landed at Queenstown and the Republicans have left Great Island.During all these operations the assistance of British Naval and Military Wireless stations, at Dublin and Queenstown Harbour, has been given to the Provisional Government authorities for the sending and receipt of their reports.Elsewhere in the south-west the Government troops have made progress. A force from Limerick has been landed at Kenmare, and Clonmel and Buttevant have been occupied ; Killarney may be taken very shortly. The Republicans are reported to have set fire to Ballincollig and Fermoy barracks and to Moore Park. It would appear that the Provisional Government columns are gradually encircling their enemy and are driving him slowly on to the Millstreet-Mallow Macroom area. Whether- there will be a decisive battle remains to be seen ; but if the Republicans have a commander of any military experience, which is doubtful, and if their men can be handled and moved in an organized body of any respectable size, which is most doubtful, the position of some of the Provisional Government converging columns might become highly dangerous. It has been assumed that Liam Lynch, of West Cork, is in supreme command of the Republicans in the south-west ; but an interview with . Michael Collins, published in the Sunday Chronicle of 13th August, mentions one &quot; Eoin Decies &quot; as being in command. There is no record of such a person, and the reporter probably confused the name with that of Liam Deasy, who was at one time Assistant Commanding Officer of the Irish Republican Army, Southern Division, and who is probably the individual referred to by General Collins. There is no reason to believe that Liam Deasy, a young Republican extremist -and successful leader of a &quot; flying column,&quot; is likely to prove himself another Stonewall
j;: &apos;     3Outside the south-western area there has been some fighting in co. Mayo and at Sligo town, and in various parts of the centre and west there have been the usual series of guerilla incidents and damage to railways and roads.But, with the attention and main effort of the Provisional Government directed to the south-west, it was only a matter of time before more serious trouble should break out as far away as possible from- the main theatre of operations that is, if the Republicans are to show any military capacity for annoying their opponents and taking their attention away from the decisive point.It was only by chance that the attempt to cut all communications between Dublin and the outside world failed last week, owing to the lucky capture of a copy of the Republican orders for the operation on an individual in Dublin. That attempt failed, but news received yesterday from Dundalk shows that the Provisional Government troops in that town have been taken, wilfully or negligently, unawares.Information is scanty, but about 2 a.m. on 14th August the Republicans succeeded in recapturing Dundalk, and by 9 a.m. all road, railway and telegraphic communication between Dublin and the north were cut at that place. It is even reported this morning that the Republicans have moved south to near Drogheda, and that a party has been detached to the south of Drogheda and Gormanstown to ambush any Provisional Government reinforcement which may be moved up from Dublin.Northern Ireland.With the exception of two or three outrages in Belfast, there is no change in the situation within the six counties at present. The. area is quiet and there has been no case of friction on the border between the Specials and the Provisional Government troops. On the contrary, friendly feeling has been shown between them at two places. Even political opponents consider that the &quot; A &quot;- Specials are carrying out their duties in an impartial manner.But though matters appear quiet on the surface, there are indications that trouble may be expected in the future. Reports are being received that the Irish Republican Army in Ulster are reorganizing, and that there are concentrations of Republicans in the border counties. It would be unwise to prophesy that the present satisfactory state of affairs will last.C. F. N. M ACRE AD Y, General,Commanding-in-Chief, Ireland.General Headquarters, Dublin.loth August, 1922.
