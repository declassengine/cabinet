f(THIS DOCUMENT IB THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITASflUC MAJESTY * 3 GOVERN.&quot;ERNMENT) .(Circulated &quot;by the Secretary bf State for War).SOUTHERN IRELAND. DUBLI1T.It i3 reported on good authority that previous to the Dublin outbreak, the leaders of the republican &quot;Executive&quot;&quot; met at the Pour Courts to decide whether they would attack the Provisional Government or the British troopso By a majority of 8 the former course was advocated,.The last formed bodies of republicans surrendered in Upper Sackville (o&apos;Connell) Street on the evening of July 5th.0athai Brugha (Charles Burgess) refused to surrender and was shot in the thigh.as he advanced revolver in hand towards the p,Gi troops.   He died of wounds on July 7th and was buried on.July 10th*Other republican leaders arrested were Robert Barton (a signatory to the Treaty), Art 0&quot;Connorj Sean 0&apos;.Kelly (re-elected member of the Dail) and Art 0&apos;Brien.Sean 0&apos;Kelly and Art 0&apos;Brien were released very shortly a,fter their arrest, and Robert Barton escaped from Portobello Barracks (p.G.) on July loth.At the final surrender nothing was seen of De Valera, Countess Markievicz, Oscar Traynor, Austin Stack and Ernest 0&apos;Malley, who were all reported as being present in the early fighting in Upper Sackville Street..It is understood that,, when this fighting beg*n, De Valera wished to direct operations from re-publican headquarters in Suffolk Street; but under threat of being shot   by the extremists he was induced to take his place in the &quot;firing line&quot; whence however he got   away before the final scenes.Much damage has been done in Sackville Street by fires which broke out in the various buildings occupied by the rebels.   More than 25 houses, including the Y.H.C.A., and the Gresham, Hamman, GranVille and Crown hotels have been gutted.The BtG. troops made use of 18 pounder field guns and smoke bombs in their.attacks; but few risks were taken by either side.    The extent of the rebel resistance is shown by the fact that very, few of the houses on the opposite side bf the Street to those,occupied by the republicans show marks of bullets.    It is believed, that fear of mines and casualties caused the Government!s forces to rely on the burning of the buildings to bring about the rebels surrender rather than resort to direct assault.    This is borne out by the cinema    (path  Gazette).-S B G R E T.C A 3 I I 1 T..0.P. 4101*REPORT BY 5BKB5RAL OJJICBl COS^HDING-lN-.

Prom an official gourde the p J3i, casualties in the Dublin fighting up to the evening of July&apos;91;h have beer\ 19 killed and. Ill wounded.    The wounded include&apos; So cases of &quot;shall shock&quot;I:Since July 5th the life of Dublin has gradually become almost normal; but there is still some sniping at night from odd republicans scattered about the town.-   The P.G. troops continue their searches of pedestrians, vehicles and houses:&apos; for arms, and all approaches into Dublin and some of the main streets, such as Grafton Street, have guarded barricades.Owing to these improved conditions British troops were allowed again into the main thoroughfares on July 10th, and no untoward incidents have so far been reported.The company of infantry sent 10 days ago to reinforce the R.I,C. garrison at the Castle will be withdrawn to-morrow July 12th, and it it reported that the final evaeua-tion of Dublin Castle will take place next week.Kilmainham Gaol and Courthouse wa3 handed over by British to p,G, troops on July 8 th.Prom first hand inforstion it is learnt that De Valera oame into Dublin late bxi the evening of July 8th from Sutton (near Howth) where he is at present residing.   He is reported to be very despondent at the result of the Dublin fighting; but still has hopes that the South may turn out to be hie trump-card.   Apparently, as regards Dublin, he had gambled on a large portion of the Curragh troops refusing to fight for the Provisional Government.The same informant states that, at the beginning of the  our Courts fighting, the Executive leaders askedj even under threat of the revolver, that the olergy at the Catholic Pro-Cathedral should Bupply two ohaplains for the republican garrisons of the Pour   Courts and other buildings.   They stated that their men were losing their morale owing to their neglect by the clergy.   Their demands were refused, except for oases &quot;in extremis&quot;.PatheraDominic and Albert, and a Curate of St Michaels and John&apos;s Church, who all took a prominent part on. the side of the republicans in Dublin, were brought up before the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin on July 10th, with what result is not yet known,A rtstop press&quot; sheet (price 2d.) headed &quot;The Irish Republic&quot;., is printed daily in Dublin in spite of an attempt by the Provisional Government to suppress it on July 7th. This publication is full sf rebel propaganda and lies.   Efforts to sell it in the streets do not appear to be very successful-, and only one or two buyers were noticed in Upper Sackville Street on the afternoon of July loth.SOUTHERN IEBLAHD.    0TJTSID3 DUBLIN.The Blessington concentration, about 500 strong, which was composed of republican bands from Cos. Dublin, Wicklow, Carlow, Kildare and possibly Tipperary, and with which Srskine Childera was reported to be, was finally dispersed on July 8th, after losing nearly 150 prisoners.   Attempts by P.G. troops to surround the rebels failed owing, partly to the nature of the hilly oountry on the south east and partly to the wet and misty weather.    The majority of the republicans got away&apos;into the Wicklow Mts.
In Co. Donegal the rounding ixp of republican bands continues; but the government troops apparently do not find it very easy.   Bands of irregulars continue to move abdut the countryside, looting clothing and foodstuffs and holding up trains on the branch lines from Derry and Strabane. On the night of July 6th/7th the republicans attacked the  -P.G. garrison at Lifford; but were repulsed.    The P.G. troops fired t*way most of their ammunition and the Rifle Brigade at Strabane (close to Lifford) sent them over 3,000 rounds of 8.AJU to carry on with IThe P.G. authorities have asked the British Military Commander on the Donegal border to let^d them an 18pr. gun and an armoured car.Elsewherej throughout the province of Leinster, and in Cos. Roscommon. Leitrim and Sli o, the Provisional Govern-ment appears to be dealing successfully with the various republican banda, whenever these occupy definitely any building or&apos;villages.   In Boyle, -(Co. Roscommon) there appears to have been a certain amount of real fighting ana the notorious Michael Lockery, a &quot;Brigadier General&quot; in the P,G. forces, wag killed.    It is darious how retribu-tion appears to be overtaking some of the worst rebels of the 1920- 1921   fighting.   Dockery (a badly &quot;wanted1&apos; man in Co. Leitrim) was strongly suspected of being responsible for the ambush near Longford on March 23rd, 1921, when Captain Peek and Lieut. Tennant of the 9ih Lancers were killed.Dockery was captured by CrOwn forces in May, 1921, and was then in possession of a map belonging to Capt. peek; he would very probably have been convicted of several murders; but managed to escape later from military custody from Boyle,A similar case was that of &quot;Brigadier General&quot; Adamson who was killed a ten weeks ago in a street brawl in Athlone. Adamson was responsible for the murder of Colonel Commandant Lambert near Athlone on June 19th, 1921.The situation in Bundalk is Still uncertain, and during the weekend two railway bridges oh the Great Northern main line to Belfast have been blown up.Millmount Barracks, Droghedaj was taken by p,G. troops -last week, the republican garrison having evacuated the building after much rifle fire and the use of an 18 pr. gun against them.    It is reported that, in the Drogheda fighting, 80,000 rounds of rifle ammunition wore expended without a 3ingle casualty.Railway communications have &quot;been much obstructed and the normal life of the countryside has been interfered with to a Very great extent.    There is at present ho communica-tion by rail between Dublin and Munster, and between Dublin and COs. Sligo, Mayo and Galway.In the province of Munster and in Cos. Galway and Mayo the situation is not so satisfactory.   It is difficult to know, what is going on in tliHJse districts.    The, towns of Galway, Limerick and Cork are reported to be quiet; but the authority of the provisional Government in the whole of that area, except possibly Co0 Glare (where the I.R.A. are loyal), is non-existent according to the statement of Mr. Dalton, Chief Liaison Officer and now assistant to 0&apos;Duffy (Chief
of Staff, Beggars Bush)...   According to Dalton; though the I.R.A. in the above area (except Go. Clare) are against the Provisional Government, the bulk of the people are for the government.    The same informant states that about 1,000 armed republicans are collected at Limerick under Sean Hoylan, Seamus Robinson, Ernest ,0&apos;Malley and Liam Lynch.   According, to the; l*Republi6 of -ireland&apos; (referred to above) issue of July- 8th,; Liais Lynch.i3 now &quot;Chief of Staff&quot; on the -yield General Headquarters .of the Executive I fR.A. which are temporarily at Mallow^ Co.- Cork.. Again, according to Dal ton, the leaders of the P,G* troops..    -(about 500 strong) in Limerick have-compromised with the republicans, and 0*Duffy, Chief of Staff, Beggars Bush, has just gone down there to enquire into the situation.Prom Spike Island and-Kaval reports it is stated that the PoGc garrison, at Skibberreen has surrendered to the rebels; that republicans round Cork, Queenstown and Crosshaven,have been commandeering motor boats ana-vehicles, foodstuffs and clothing; and&apos;that 70 armed republicans are in control of Clifden, Co. Galway&apos;and are censoring the messages sent by the Marconi w/T station at that place.NORTHERN IRELAND&apos;.The past week has been one of marked quiet in the Six Counties.Events in the Forth East have been largely overshadowed by the offensive declared by the Provisional Government on the extreme republicans&apos; in the South..  This offensive has had a quietening effect upon all parties in ulster.   Extrome Unionists are gratified at the attacks on their worst enemies, while the I.R.A.- of the Northern Divisions once more find them-selves in the predicament of April last, when they were forced to stand fast and consider their attitude towards the split in the I.R.A. in the south. -Valuable documents have been captured in raids during the past 10 days in Belfast,. Londonderry and Banbridge, These indicate that the disorganisation in the I.R.A. caused by the action of the police since Hay 22nd has been greater than was supposed. - The majority of the I .R.Agunmen of the north have either moved out of the six counties or are in hiding.    A valuable diary of a Co. Derry I.R.A. Battalion , Commander shows that th:  leaders of units in that county have lead a very harrassed existence recently.Those working for the destruction of the Treaty and the establishment of a Republic by the furthering of strife and murder in Ulster are at the moment rendered powerless by the attack of the Provisional Government on their forces in the south and by the continued police pressure on their forces in the north.Ho change in the situation is likely while this pressure in the north and south continues.
10CONCLUSIONS.Except in Ulster and Leinator the situation in Ireland,. generally speaking,  cannot yet be said to be satisfactory. -De Valera has certainly lost caste by omitting to &quot;see things out&quot; in Sackville Street; but the armed republican movement has not yet been dealt with seriously. . That the provisional Government realise this id shown by their proclamation of July 6th In which they call for volunteers to help them, to restore order in Southern Ireland;.. Although the newspapers state, that this call is having a highly satisfactory response, other&apos; information points to there bein;: no great rush of recruits at any rate in Dublin,   preference, for political reasons, is being given to those who are, or have been, members of the&quot; IoR.A,; but ex-officers and ex-soldiers will be welcomed although these will be kept in separate units to be formed later at the Curragh.    Service will be for six months.    Up to date the Provisional Government have taken over, in addition to arms, ammunition and other stores, five Rolls Royce and two Peerless armoured cars, and one Bristol Fighter aeroplane. Their Directors.of Military and Civil Aviation arc respect-ively named McSwiney and Russell, both ex-RtA..F.. pilots and both aged about.23 years.-hether the present organisation and ability of the Beggars Bush headcuurtero will be capable of handling, training and fitting out any large number of men is very doubtful.   Experi-ence only will teach them the difficulties of forming and training a hastily enlisted force without organised resources.(Sgd.)&apos; CF.il.
