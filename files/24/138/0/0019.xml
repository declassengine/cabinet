The matter is urgent, and I hope that the Cabinet will be able to consider it at a very early date.L. W.-E.The War Office,22nd July, 1922.1. (a) Northern Ireland: So far as can be foreseen at present, it will be necessary to maintain a force of at least 16 battalions in Northern Ireland during the coming winter.The tactical situation requires that the troops shall be stationed at certain carefully selected points, from which threatened localities on the border may readily be reached in the event of emergency.The proposed distribution will necessitate the provision of hutting for the equivalent of three battalions from the end of the camping season (30th September) at an approximate cost of  66,000, and also for certain detachments of the Royal Air Force, for which the cost will be, approximately,  2,270. These estimates will be materially increased should it be necessary to provide for the actual occupation of the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State.(b) Dublin: The number of battalions at present under canvas in Dublin is six, and there is little likelihood that any reduction can be made in this force before the winter. No permanent accommodation is available, as both Wellington and Portobello Barracks have been handed over to the Provisional Government, and are, in any event, outside the area of concentration laid down by the General Officer Commanding. As billeting is not, in existing circumstances, a possible alternative, it will be necessary to provide hutting for six battalions at a cost of  170,000, to which must be added accommodation for appropriate detachments of the Royal Air Force, costing, approximately,  2,680.2. The above are rough estimates based on the assumption that the troops are to be provided with reasonably comfortable accommodation of a standard approximating to that which has been adopted for hutted camps in Great Britain and Ireland, including the usual accessories, e.g., mess, recreation and dining huts, baths, electric lighting where essential only, &amp;c, and also that cover for horses and motor transport is to be, supplied. The figures are subject to amendment on complete examination.3. In view of the shortness of the time available for making the requisite arrange-ments to ensure that the above hutting may be ready for occupation by the end of the camping season, the question is submitted for a very early decision.(B22/205)   100   7/22   W.O.P.   211
