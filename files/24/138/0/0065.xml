BE COMMUNISMLondon oommuni^rtrs and more particularly the [dieses Committee of the London and Home Counties Council are still working out the English application of Moscow1 s instructions and on August 12th a meeting was held to explain some of the changes in organisation entailed:   among the &quot;branches repre-sented were South West Earn, north Ham and East Earn, Ilrord, Poplar and Barking:    Thomas Irving was in the chair and Palme Butt gave an address on the theses, while Page Arnott and A.G.Tompkins spoke respectively on &quot;Par East London&quot; and on &quot;information required&quot;.     The discussion on these matters wa-e opened by E.W.Cant.On August 10th the following circular was sent by E.W.Cant to all oommunist branches in London and the Home Counties:the reference to the Second Report of the Party commission,extracts of which are given as an appendix : to this report,indicate the importance attached by communists to this documenti&quot;Re Second Report of Party Commission.All branches will now have tho second report of the Party Commission.    It will be obvious to all concerned that this cannot be read as correspondence to the branch in the ordinary way, because it needs careful studying, I would suggest, therefore, that the branches should . form groups of four to six members, and that each group should take the document for one week, and should arrange to meet as often as possible during the week, in order that it might receive the close and careful study that its importance warrants.Re the Party Conference in October.All branches have also had notice tHat a Party Congress will be held in London early in October.    The tergls for representation will be the same as at the last Conference.     There will be a pooling arrangement, and the average cost to the London Branches will be somewhere about  2 per branch.   Branches should immediately commence to make provision for this.     If a definite sum is set aside oaoh week it should not be difficult, but it would be an absolute disgrace if the London branches were not fully/
fully represented at a Conference held in London. Besides the matters for discussion are so important thai; the whole future of the movement may be wrapped up in them.Please do not forget to ask members who are attend-ing the Trades Union Congress to communicate immediately with Comrade Harry Yfebb at 16, King Street.    &quot;Pending the introduction of the new forms of organisation I want to ask branches to use every endeavour to maintain the existing position and reports of all activities in the labour movement should be sent to me.&quot;The Executive Committee of the Communist Party has in-structed its members in tho South Hackney division to render all possible assistance to the Labour candidate, but their help appears to have been in the nature of a hindrance and it is doubtful whether it is appreciated by the Labour Party.Inkpin is reported to have resumed his position as National Secretary of the Communist Party.Eugen Varga, acting for Zinoviev, has requested the Executive of the Communist Party of Great Britain, to send him I immediately all documents which appertain to the forthcoming conference of the Third International in Moscow.A copy of a document has come into my possession whichwas despatched on July 27th by the Central European Bureau ofthe International Propaganda Committee of Professional Workers,of which Ludvig Geisehberg is a representative.     The following is a translation of the material parts of this document, whichwas addressed to the Communist Teachers1 Section of theCommunist Party of Great Britain:- .   ...&quot;An international Propaganda. Committee of Profession-al Workers was founded at the Moscow. Congress of the Red International of labour Unions last year.   T have been commissioned by the Central European Bureau of the Red International of Labour Unions to get into touch with you... and request you to send me information regarding the present position of your teachers movement and of the opposing organisations...&quot;In the last few weeks I have learnt that the Educational International which was provisionally foundedat/
at Bordeaux in the summer of 1920 will hold ah : inaugural conference in West Germany or in Paris in August of this year,    This step is particularly desired by the French teachers.,     Fimmen, the secretary of the Amsterdam International is also trying to found an international &quot;bureau for teachers, naturally   of the Amsterdam per-suasion..   From the above you will see that it is necessary to pay the closest attention to these matters.&quot;A- Hoderoff is in touch with Sylvia PanMiurst and has offered to send her &quot;Rosta, the official agency of Soviet Russia and ... Dalta, that of the Far Eastern Republic, both endeavouring to give out the latest information about Russia to the foreign press&quot;.     Both these papers are published at Culty Chambers, Legation Quarter, Peking.*2he International Press Correspondence is now being sent from Berlin to various English trade union journals.It seems likely that the Arcos boats which are trading between Russia and this country are media for the transport of bolshevik propaganda and are links in the courier service. It will be remembei-ed that various British extremists have recently joined these boats and the Chief Constable of Middleshorough Informs me that he has received a report to the effect that when the Russian S.S.&quot;Bolshevik&quot; recently visit-ed Aberdeen and Hartlepool the master and crew were entertained by local extremists and made the most of their opportunities for propaganda.     A Middlesbcrcugh communist, a Russian Pole named leah Dersh, visited the boat at West Hartlepool and wrote a eulogistic account of her experiences in &quot;The Communist&quot; of August 12th. YOUNG COMMIJHlSg LEAGUE&apos;m&apos; The Berlin representative of the Young Communist Inter-national, wh&amp; is in London, has sent an urgent demand for money to his headquarters.     He has apparently sent a certain sum in French money to Berlin and has spent all the remaining funds
on the recent conference of the Young Communist League.     He considers the conference to have been most satisfactory and is pleased with the progress made by the League:    a new executive committee has been appointed and it is possible that James Stewart will continue his work at Grayrs Inn Load for a short time only.Copies of the following resolution have been forwarded tothe Young Communist International:-&quot;Shis first national congress of the Y.C.L. of Great Britain sends, through the Y.C.I. fraternal greet-ings to the revolutionary youth of the world.    It records with satisfaction the energetic attempts of the Y.C.I. to form a united front of the working youth of the whole world by taking the initiative in proposing to call a world congress of all proletarian youth organisations. .-:   It pledges itself to wholeheartedly support the Inter-national In its work for the speedy realisation of the objects in this countrv outlined in its Thesis and Statutes.LONG LIVE THE RE VOLUTI ON All Y YOUTH I LONG LIVE THE Y.C.I.L LONG LIVE THE WORLD REVOLUTION!&quot; &apos; The Lithuanian group of communists has not yet affiliated to the Young Communist League although it was represented at j the conference, but negotiations are in progress between James Stewart and Merkevitch. .The Moscow Executive of the Young Communist International is making arrangements to hold an international conference of &quot;leaders of children&apos;8 sections departments&quot; from September 16th - September 18th and has instructed .the English delegates to make their preparations and forward their opinion on the material sent for their consideration. THE UNEMPLOYEDAccording to the reports received the march of the group of Birmingham unemployed to London has been uneventful:   sevei meetings have been held, at which Bridgen and Ganley have-been/1
been the principal speakers and the men appear to have been hospitably received by labour, co-operative and unemployed organisations in the towns through which they passed:    they reached London yesterday and intend to hold a meeting in Hyde Park today, afterwards marching towards Whitehall, where a Birmingham deputation hopes to interview the Minister of Health and the Minister of Labour,,      The men expect to stay in Poplar for about a week.It is reported that a contingent of Newcastle unemployed is also marching to London with an object similar to that of the Birmingham men.On August 13th the London Listrict Council of the Unem-ployed Workers Committee Movement held a demonstration in Trafalgar Square, at which about 400 people were present, of whom only 100 were genuine unemployed.     Pendery was in the chair and baBishop and W.Gallaeher spoke.     The speeches call, for no comment, but an American lawyer in the audience was allowed on the plinth to answer some of Gallacherrs remarks about the United States:    he afterwards contributed  1 to the collection, which totalled  2:2:0.     The Chairman announced that some of the Birmingham marchers would speak at another meeting in tho Square on August 27th.One of the principal organisers of the Scottish unemployedhas reported to headquarters that:-.&quot;Unfortunately in Scotland, we have only been able, except in a few localities, to attract the lower strata of the Working Class.     There has not been that influx: of the artisan class, who are more or. less equipped, for   &apos;&quot; the detail work connected with an organisation such as ours,     I am confident that the months ahead of us fraught as they undoubtedly are with the direct conse-quences for all members of. the working class, will see a &quot; larger number of the more stable elements enter our ranks.&quot;
THE, &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;On August 13th one of the sub-editors of the &quot;daily herald&quot; sent a c^ra^runXoation to a foreign correspondent which contains interesting information regarding George Lanshury!spropable successor and Gerald Gould, a/former director:&quot;&apos;3!here is really nothing much to bol&quot; about the future of the D.H. beyond what has a1ready appeared in the paper.    The most interesting ite-: of news is that the new man, to take G.LJs place, will, -it is almost certain, be Hamilton Fyfe.Some of us had lunch with him last week and, so far as we could judge, he seems quite decent.   He has vague ideas of changing the character of tho paper so as to -gefc a certain r.uaber.of the news stories re-written and given a semi-propaganda turn.   But I doart think much will be don-9 on these lines at any rate for some time. Beyond that his ideas are not yot formed - naturally enough.If everything goes alright at the Trades Union Congress we go to a penny on Sept.11th and H.P. takes charge on the 10oh.    He will be floating about the office for some days before that.Thora seems to bo a lull in the rumours about any of us having to go.    They may revive but just now every-thing is quiet.  ,Of course you will have heard of the passing of Gould,   He is now simply a leader writer and has no control over the paper at all.     He has made a good job cut of it for himself, by the way he gets  600 a year and for that he is expected to write four or five lead-ers a week, review a book and do a &quot;special&quot;!    Incident-ally when the contract was made it was understood that he would review any book;   now he tells G.L. that he has a contract with the&apos; &quot;Saturday Review&quot; to review books for them - so he oanTt do them for usj   G.L. is fed to the teeth with himf...ARRESTSKeep the G.G. business to yourself, and also FyfeJ&quot;jAs a result of information regarding the movements of certain members of the underground organisation of the Communis&apos; Party, James Anderson, alias McManus, a brother of the Chairman of the Communist Party of Great Britain was arrested on lugust 10th ana charged with being in possession of a revolver without a Firearms1 Certificate and with carrying a gun else-&apos;-where/
where than In a dwelling house without a licence.     A quantity of communist literature was found in his possession:   he was remanded until today.The Ghief Constable of Birmingham informs me that on August 11th John Trotter was arrested in consequence of a speech made at a communist meeting In tho Bull Ring on August 7th:    he was remanded until August 22nd, hail being allowed on his undertaking to refrain from making public speeches in the meantime.ESH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN GREAT britain-7&apos;ob.d-nt IItha:reArthur Grii&apos;fithls. untimely death came as. a great shock to his supporters in this country, many of whom refuse to accept the official acoount of it and hint at foul play.    They regard his removal at this cx^political moment as nothing short of a calamity, a&amp;though they believe the success of the Free State to be assured.     The question of his successor is one upon which it is very difficult to get any&apos;decided opinion.Art O^rie^s followers in London, although embarrased by his absence, continue their work of propaganda on behalf of the Republicans.    They are reproducing rebel leaflets and en-endeavouring to circulate them both at home and abroad.     A   . large number have been held up In the post.The Irish Self-Betermination League is practically de-funct and its.meetings are few and far between.     Many of the branches are bping turned into social clubs and severing their connection with the League altogether.&apos;  Of the new Free State League there is.nothing worth reporting.The Irish Communists are showing increased activity. Their organ &quot;The Workers&apos;. Republic&apos;7 us its issue of the 12th August says that at all costs the machinery of the Republic
must be maintained.    It advocates the summoning of the Re-publican members of the Second and (Third Bail, together with tf Labour members and the setting up of an entirely Republican Government in the south.     The first duty would, be to formulatf a programme on the following basis. 1.     Ownership and control of all the heavy industries &quot;byf the State for the benefit of all the people.2.     Complete ownership of the transport system by the State; Railways, canals, shipping, etc.3,     State ownership of all Banks.4.     Confiscation of the large ranches and estates without compensation to the landed aristocracy and the distrif huticn of the lend amongst the landless farmers and agricultural labourers, otc. etc.5.     Establishment of an all-round eight-hour working day,l6.     Control of workshops.V.     Municipalisatlon of all public services, trams, light] heat, water, etc. and free use by the workers.G.     Compulsory rationing of housing accommodation and abolition of rents.9.     Full maintenance for the unemployed at full trade union rates,10.     Universal arming of all workers in town and country to &quot;defend their rights&quot;.Sinn Fein in Scotland is not progressing.   Some of the Republicans are anxious to break away and form new clubs but the Standing Committee oannot agree on the point and the clubs drift along aimlessly.At a meeting of the ^Connolly Club on the 11th August John Sloyne was elected President to replace James ScGrady recently resigned, while Lawrence Carty, Andrew Gallagher and Rose 0&apos;Connor were added to the Committee. A letter was read from the Central Executive Standing Committee saying that, for the present, nothing definite could be done regarding the appoint-ment of an organiser for Scotland and also advising that special care/
care should he taken in the selection of new members, obviously for the purpose of excluding supporters of the Free State.A motion by Tom Dohorty to discontinue advertising in the &quot;Glasgow Observer&quot; was carried;    Doherty said he considered the &quot;Observer&quot; as great an enemy as Michael Collins.The meeting decided to send a letter of condolence to the parents of Dunn and O&apos;1&apos;Sullivan recently executed. During the discussion there were some strong remarks made about the Prime Minister, Mr,Churchill and Lord Carson, especially the latter.A second appeal is being made on behalf of, the Republican prisoners in Dublin for underclothing and food.    They complain bitterly of their treatment at the hands of the Free State officials..&quot;The Republic of Ireland&quot; is now printed by Eirkwood and Company, 127, Stockv/ell Street, Glasgow,
appendixSECOND REPORT OF -TEE PARTY COMMISSIONJuly 29th, 1922.RAMBLEThese proposals are not yet final and are only being circulated now in their unrevised form in-order that members may have the earliest possible moment, for giving them oon-siderntion.    .Our full report to the conference and draft proposals,, in their final form for amendment cr adoption by the conferences will be circulated shortly, so as to give members time for their consideration before the conference. The general proposals here set, out should be carefully read and considered at one or more branch meetings.v.No action should be taken on the proposals in this report:at present.,     Branches should defer acting on this or any . -other scheme of reorganisation until further - instructed.&apos;. -nSince the last meeting of the Executive Committee the Party Commission has been in continuous session.; end. has now completed the main portion of its work.   -Our first report dealt with the existing position of Party Crga.nisat.-ion and the immediate question of finance to be tackled.     The present report covers the actual work .of- reorganisation...;It is necessary to be clear why we need to reorganise.Our first need today is to establish our contact with the masses.     Our Part-; is&apos; not yet an integral part of the movement; it is still only straggling on the fringe to make itself felt.     It has not yet been able to win the confidence of the workers&apos; as their expression and ohsaipiona     We have not yet been able to gi/e the leai.. but even if we had been able to give the lead we have not been organised for leadership. We are no t ye fc a party.,    We are still only scattered indI yi-dual,? Fitr &quot;wgiing he re, and there up and. down the -country. There is no sumbiniug force *     We&quot; have, still to build our general staff and  bo organise the workers under its lead. This is the object which we need to keep throughout in mind...We have to meet concrete needs.    It is only in so far aspresent methods are failing to produce results, are leading to confusion, and lack of effective activity that we need to grasp the cause, of the weakness and to look for.the methods thatwill remedy them.-.      Our guide to find those methods exists in the principles laid down in the Theses and based on the exper-te GENERAL AIMience/
ience of the International movement.     But the Theses only gives us principles and not a complete ready made machine. Our &quot;business is to understand these principles and to have a clear common understanding what in general is wrong and what in general we are aiming at...We must he prepared for one thing,     The principles of Communist organisation represent a complete revolutionary breai with the old socialist traditions of ineffectiveness in this country.    It is as great a break in methods of organisation as the break in theory from democracy to dictatorship.   This is to the good and we all welcome it in theory.   But we shall need, to remember it again and again in practice, when we find some cherished old belief or sentiment being ruthlessly scrapped. Our task is not to create some &quot;propagandist&quot; society or re-volutionary club, hut to create an efficient machine1 of the class struggle, capable of organising the entire working class movement for the struggle of confronting and battling with the complicated and centralised apparatus of the State, and events ally, of taking in hand the organisation of production itself.,The branch can never he the unit of organisation and direction.    If we wish to sum up our immediate work ahead in a single slogan, that slogan would be &quot;down with the old sty la branch&quot;.   The small local branch has no organic character as   j a unit and that is the secret of Its continual apathy and its j deedneiss.    In Its-place we need to work for the smaller unit   j of the actual working group and the large unit of the Direct- I ing District Centre.   The branch only remains (and then for a muchwlder body of membership wherever possible) as a general meeting of members at longer intervals for the explanation of important issues of Party policy and as a basis for re-gist-ration and elections.     In place of the present system of small local branches, each devising its own activities and loosely federated in divisions we need to have the new system of working groups, the aggregate meeting and the District Centre.     The District Centres and the Party Centre are organ-! Ised to direct activities of the membership.     The members are I allocated to their work in working groups each with Its speciflj task.     The tasks are fixed to produce results and only to produce results.   Results mean the demonstrable increase of thel Party1a influence in the working class, whether by increase of J membership, increase of readers of the paper, winning of sym-pathisers- and -contacts, or securing control of organisations. This is the general conception of Communist Organisation ex-plained in the Theses.The governing principles of our work are thus clearly marked out, they are:-(1)   Centralised direction, - the establishment of strong direc ing centres operating in conjunction with the- Party Centre.(2) Division of work - the allocations of members to working groups for special tasks and the drawing of every member into the work by this means.(3)   Organised influence in the working class:    the aim of conscious direction, concentrating and concentrating of ell   ; activities of our groups with a view to building up a networki of influence throughout the working class and its organisations.DISTRICT/
DlWjICT AND . IOOAIi. ORGAN IS A T IONSThe District Party -Committee divides into two sections or Bureaux (a Bureau is a small managing, or administrative &apos; commit tea; - the Organising Bureau end the. Political. Bureau, corresponding to the sa.me two Bureaus of; the Sxscutirov The OTgsmisiag Bureau deals with technical.q seVisions of or-ganisation - records, finance/ allocation ox membership to specific work, communications ana 3. i.s1ri utions0     The political bureau deals with the direct ion of Party activities (it should be remembered that all Party activities are &quot;political&quot;, s,g, our work in the unions Is political) i.o, general meetings and campaigns, work in the Unions and the workshop,., elections and local government, etc.     Each bureau is responsible for seeing tothe carrying out of the work under its - care and preparing&apos;matters for discussion by the full eoT^nitteeV     The District Party Committee as&apos; a viiola decides all important questions of principle.u?he Individual members of either Bureau take charge each of a&apos;separate department of its work, using, where -necessary, a committee to assist him.The departments cf work of the Organising Bureau are -- (1)   Register of members, with their qualifications, etc. and the work to which they are allocated..-     (2)   Subscribers and Finance.(3)    Communications - maintenance of communications between localities and between workshops.(4)   Distribution - through the distribution groups in the localities.(5)    Information - collecting of information through the local information ,groups-. &apos;(5).   Technical supplementary work.    The work of the Organising Bureau, being technical in character, would not normally need any committee or committees, but only the securing of e.ssis- -t fence&apos; oil the records works   During ,the period of re--.&apos;orgam.satioi: -however, it will prctsbjy be necessary tc have a special Organising Committee to carry out..the -actual work ox-.&apos; rs-organ! ai.Xj.Q-a     The; work of. --such a Committee will be indicated in the proposals cn Initial Steps, apart&apos; from this temporary Committee lor re-Orgarasation, the only need in ordinary . tirces will be- the appcj ntmpnt&apos; ft om time to ;tlme -of some special organisers or commissioners to carry out a special piece of organising-work,- when cccasicn arises.The departments of work of-the Political Eureau, covering all the different sections of-Party activity and:.the . direction of- the groups carrying out these activities/ which -ijWed sach its leading committees under the Chairmanship of ths Bureau member detailed for that activity, these would cover.-(1)   Elections and Municipal Committees - for the election work  parliamentary and Municipal) directions of candidates
and direction of municipal representatives.(2)   Trade Union and Workshop Committee - for direction of nuclei in the unions and in the workshops.(3)    Labour and Co-operative Committees - for direction of fractions on local Labour parties and Trades Councils, nuclei in Co-operative Sooieties and contracts in local Socialists organisations.(4)   Propaganda Committee * in charge of the Local Propaganda Committees, co-ordinating arrangements for meetings lectures and socials, organising special demonstrations and campaigns, furnishing speakers with lines to go on and arrang. ing assistance where necessary.(5)   women&apos;s Propaganda Committee - directing the woman&apos;s propaganda committees in the localities&quot; and under the leader-ship of the women&apos;8 Sect, representative and the District Party Committee.(6)   Educational Committee - dealing with the work of the training groups and special instruction courses.(7)   Political Supplementary Committee.The work of these Committees needs to.be carefully arrangs and prepared so that they cover the actual day to day work of oontaot with the groups under their charge and forwarding of instructions, and do not turn into old style discussion coin-mitteeB on policy, the decisions on which are the province of the District party Committee.     Regular minutes, agenda and reporting to the District Party Committee, to whom they are responsible, are essential on all the more important Committees A District Party Committee member must be, present.    Thus, if we suppose a District Party Committee of eight, three might form the organising bureau and five the political bureau. The five members of the Political Bureau would cover between them the first five Committees on the list, i.e. Elections and Municipal, Trade Unions and Workshop, Labour and Co-operative Propaganda and women&apos;s Propaganda.The importance of districts securing tho services of a full time organiser, if they can afford one is very great. The work of a district organiser should not be taken up with the clerical work of maintaining records (which, should be look ed after by the organising bureau with the aid. of the local comrades) or with going round on general propaganda meetings in the localities.     The main work of a district organiser is to initiate activities, build up organisation and take in hand special campaigns.     District organisers are nominated by the Executive Committee.     When it is not possible to maintain a full time organiser or even a half time organiser, it will be necessary to use several unpaid organisers.    In any case the District Party Committee will appoint as occasion arises spec lal organisers, local organisers or special commissioners to carry out particular tasks.   The District Party Committee has full right to send a special Commissioner into a locality to carry out a particular task, in the same way as the Executive Committee has full right to send a special Commissioner Into a district to carry out a particular task...
