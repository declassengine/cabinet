No to by Acting Secretary.A aopy of a Memorandum which haa been presented by the Earl of Balfour to the Council of the League of Baticns on the subject of tho Holy Places Commission tc be appointed In pursuanco of Article 14 cf tho Mandate for Palestine, is circulated herewith for information.(Signed)      THOMAS JONE3*Z Whitehall Gardens, S.T7.1. 4th September, 1922.
Memorandum by thei British Representative.Article XIV of the Mandate for Palestine provides as follows&quot;A special Commission shall he appointed by the Mandatory to study, define and determine the rights and claims in connection with the Holy Places and the rights and claims relating to the different religious communities in Palestine,     The method of nomination, the composition and the functions of this Commission shall be submitted to the Council of the League for its approval, and the Commission shall not be appointed or enter upon its functions without the approval of the Council&quot;. This provision must be read in connection with Article 13 which imposes upon the Mandatory the responsibility of preserving existing rights in connection with the Holy PlaceB, thus envisaging the maintenance of the &quot;status quo&quot;.In order to ensure that questions affecting Christians should be considered and settled by Christians without the intervention of Jews and Mahommedans, the Holy Places Commission should be divided into three sub-commissions, one Christian, one Moslem and one Jewish.     These sub-commissions 1 should each deal, to the exclusion of the other two, with questions solely affecting the religion concerned.     Each sub-commission will have its own president who will preside over its deliberations.There should be a chairman of the commission who should be an individual of high standing and judicial temper-ament, and enjoying a position which will ensure confidence in his impartiality.
4. In each sub-ocmmiseion the States and confessions moreparticularly concerned should be represented.     The Christian sub-commission might be composed of a Trench president;    three Catholio representatives (Italian, Spanish and Belgian); three Orthodox (one of whom should bo Greek and one Russian); one Armenian, and one or possibly two representatives of the Abyssinians and the Copts unless both these communities are of the same oonfession in which case one representative would bo sufficient.     The Moslem sub-commission might consist of an Italian President, together with a Palestinian, a Prench and an Indian Moslem.     The Jewish sub-commission might consist of an American President and a Palestinian, a British and a PortuguOse (or Spanish) Jew to represent the Sephardic sect.5. Unanimous reports of any one of these sub-commissionsshould be definitive in every case except where the Council of the League of Nations, under whose guarantee the Holy Places are to bo placed, refer back some particular point for further consideration.     Where no unanimity oan be achieved in a sub-commission it will be well to refer the point on which the members do not agree to the Chairman of the whole commission for decision.6. Questions or claims affecting more than one religionmight be dealt with by representatives of the two sub-commissions conoerned sitting together.     Points upon which there oan be-no agreement might in the same way be referred to the Chairman&apos;of the whole Commission for decision.7. A secretariat will be required, for the commission, and asthe expenses of the secretariat will fail upon the Administra-tion of Palestine, H.M.Government will appoint the Secretary-General.8 *   O   U
An-Am^ix^rucitt^n^rf ^ymftM^ pr^mLrtertc-e. wold., appear to be the most suitable chairman of the whoJ^*cowrtiJ9-* sion.   Such an appointment will be particularly suitable as it will enable representation to be given to the Pro-* testant communities who would not otherwise be represented in the commission.The chairman of the commission and the president of each sub-commission would be appointed by the Mandatory after consultation between H.M.Government and the Government concerned.    The representatives of the various confessions would be appointed In consultation with the heads of the religious denominations concerned,,  r where this was not possible, In c.t. ns\iltation with the Governme its concerned. These appointments would not be made until they had been approved by the Oouncil of the League.The expenses of the chairman of the commission and of the presidents of the three sub-commisslons should be borne bv the League of Nations.   The expenses of the representa-Ives of the various religions and confessions should be borne by the religious comunities whom they represent.   The expenses of the secretariat should be borne by the Administration of Palestine.If any permanent arrangements are necessary for dealing with questions which may arise in the future as.-to the interpretation of the reports and re commendations-&apos;&apos;of the commission or on new questions that may&apos;arise, it might be provided by establishing small local committees to be selected and nominated by each of the sub-commissions. For any matters with which these local/committees were unable to settle, the sub-committee concerned, or If necessary the whole Holy Places- -Coramla-s^on, might be re-assembled,( . . -
12. It must be clearly understood that thsfunctions of the Holy Places Commission cb. not include any administrative responsibility nor any interference with the right and duty of the Mandatory to maintain order and decorum.
