POINCARE Ii! reply TO &quot;SOTS PROM TILE acting secretary OF STATE eof    foreign AFFAIRS, DATED AUGUST 1st,  1922.    -Ministrjr of Foreign Affairs, Translation. paria.September 1st, 1922.Monsieur 1,Ambassadeur,Lord Balfour, on August 1st, addressed to the French Ambassador in London, as well as to the representatives of the other European States allied to Great Britain, a note in which the British Government submitted to the French Government its views on certain aspects of the situation produced by the present state of international indebtedness. His Majesty&apos;s Government consequently invited the French Government to take measures to deal to the best of their ability with the question of French debts to Great Britain, explaining at the same time that the amount of the interest and of the repayments for which it was asking did not depend so much on what France and the other Allies owed to Great Britain as on what Great 3ritain had to pay to the United States.It declared that it was so entirely convinced of the nefarious influence of the present state of things on the economic situation throughout the world that it would he disposed - subject to reservations in regard to the just claims of the other States of the British Empire - henceforth to renounce all claims to German,reparations and to repay-ment on the part of the Allies, on the condition that this renunciation were included in a general plan by means of which this important problem could he considered as a whole and solved in a satisfactory manner.
The French Government attached to this communication, the noble and. courteous terms of which- are highly appreciate the full importance which, it deserves.    The French Goyern-ment like the British Government is convinced that the Reparation problem can receive no final solution unless it is linked in some way or other with the problem of inter-Allied debts.    The French Government think: it necessary that this question should shortly be examined in all its aspects at a Conference to which should, be invited without exception all the Allied States concerned-    It might have been examined at the recent London Conference if the 3riti3h Government had not previously by its note of August 1st defined its attitude by inviting the French Government to take measures to pay in proportion as Great Britain is obliged to pay to the United States.I think it right to point out that no assimilation can be established between the war debts which the Allies contracted between themselves and Reparation debts.If the Allied Governments had not afforded one another the reciprocal financial, aid,  out of which arose the war debts,  either the war would have ended badly for them or it would have lasted longer, and in any case it is the lending countries which should have made,  either by the work of their industries or by the despatch of larger effectives, the effort which the borrowing countries made in their stead.   All these debts were contracted in the interest of the common cause.    The purchases which they helped to make all contributed to the victory.    In the course of the drafting of the peace Treaty the victoriouscountries/
countries decided to renounce for the first tine in history a claim against the defeated countries for the costs of the war.      If the payment of the war debts were demanded, part of these costs would devolve on those of the Allied countries which made in a military sense the greatest effort, and which assumed the heaviest burden of the war.As Lord half our so excellently says, the inter-Allied debts were contracted, not for the individual benefit of particular states, but for the great aim common to all, an aim which, as a whole, was realised.      Prom a moral ppint of view, suoh a realisation would justify a canoella-tion of these debts.      At the least, it cannot be contended that it does not give to these debts a character different from that of ordinary international debts.On the Contrary, the German reparation debt is the result of wilful destruction, most of which was useless, and of the payment of pensions devolving on the Allied Governments for the losses Inflicted by Germany,This necessary reparation of the damage wrought must naturally have priority over all other settlement.     As far as Prance is concerned, who of all the belligerent States was the most affected by territorial destruction, she has been compelled, owing to the fact that the payments promised by Germany have not been effected, to proceed herself to the reconstruction of her devastated provinces,      It is the advances made for this purpose which have brought about the present instability of her Budget.      There can be no question for her of contemplating any settlement of the debts she contracted during the war, so long as the outlay/made
made by her, and still to be made, for the reconstruction of her devastated regions has not been covered by Germany directly, or by means of a transaction, which would allow her to mobilise as soon as possible an adequate portion of her debt.Once Germany has acquitted herself of this obligation, which must take precedence over all others, the French Government would not be opposed to the consideration of a general settlement of international debts eFurther, when the French Government comes to consider In particular the settlement of her debt to Great Britain., certain considerations will first have to be taken into account.In the first place, the French Government, which only borrowed from the United States and from Great Britain to cover her own purchases, and without there being any question of the security of a third party, will have to draw a dis-tinction between the war debts owed by her to these two countries.     Part of the French debt to the United States was contracted after the Armistice to cover the purchase of American stocks taken over by the French Government and resold for the benefit of the French Treasury.     It is here at any rate a question of a commercial debt.     In regard to the rest of the American claim on France the same argu-ment can undoubtedly be put forward as in the case of the other inter-Allied claims.     It cannot be forgotten, how-ever, that the United States came into the War without its . existence being directly threatened, In order to defend, with Its honour, the principles which lie at the basis of civilisation, whereas Great Britain, like France, had In/addition
addition to safeguard not only her independence and her territory, hut also the life, the property, and the means of existence of her nationals-Further,  the amount of the British claim, which in fact has not yet been determined in actual figures, should in equity be subject to revision.    For instance, in the case of assignments of foodstuffs and material between Allies the Department of the British Quartermaster-General debited all delivaries at the maximum price, and added thereto, in order to cover departmental expenses, i.e,,  the general costs and the export duties received by the British Exchequer, whilst, on the contrary?  the French Intendance reckoned its assignments to tho British Army at the interior rates (t&amp;rif Interleur) paid for assignments by one French service to another, without taking into account general costs or taxes.When, therefore, the payments made for the reconstruction of the devasted regions of France allow of a settlement of Inter-Allied debts,  such settlement will have to be preceded by a minute examination, in or dor to fix the amount of the debts at an equitable figure, established on identical bases. Further, the settlement will have to be as general as possible.    The Government of the Republic in this respect asks to be treated as it itself treats our joint Allies, It does not claim payment of the sum which our Allies owe to it.     It realises that, morally and materially, such a claim would at present be inadmissable, and it has no idea of presenting it.While recognising tho spirit in which the BritishGovernment/
Government desires to discuss tho-prcJblem.....Of&apos; irrterriationaldebts, the Government of the Republic wishos to draw its attention to the above considerations *   Subject to these reservations, it considers, as does the British Government, that tho general settlement of these debts1, if brought about by mutual sacrifices,would be profitable to humanity.(Signed) . .
