[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1922.SECRET.CP. 4193.THE CUSHENDALL ENQUIRY.Report by Mr. F. T. Harrington-Ward, K.C.(Circulated by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.)To the Right Honourable Winston Spencer Churchill,His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for the Colonies.Sir,I HAVE the honour to report that, in pursuance of your appointment of the 5th August, 1922, I have enquired into the circumstances in which John Gore, James McAllister and John Hill were killed at Cushendall. County Antrim, on the 23rd June last.I left London on Monday, the 21st August, and after consultation with the Minister for Home Affairs, the Attorney-General and other responsible authorities of the Government of Northern Ireland gave notice on the 22nd August of a pre-liminary public sitting on Friday, the 25th August, at Ballymena to determine the procedure to be adopted by me in conducting the enquiry. The interval before this preliminary sitting was occupied in considering the various documents submitted to me by the Government of Northern Ireland, the Crown Forces and others.At the preliminary sitting on the 25th August at Ballymena there appeared before me Mr. E. S. Murphy, K.C., and Mr. J. C. Davison, for the Government of Northern Ireland; Lieut.-Colonel H. M. Meyler, D.S.O., M.C., Legal Adviser H.Q. Ulster Forces; Mr. J. K. Currie, Solicitor, of Ballymena, for the Special Constables concerned; and Sergeant Hanna, K.C., and Mr. T. J. Campbell, K.C. (instructed by Mr. John P. McCann, Solicitor, of Ballymena), for the next-of-kin of the deceased men; while Colonel B. H. Waters-Taylor, C.B.E., C.M.G., of the Military Adviser&apos;s Staff, watched the proceedings. I heard what was urged by Counsel and other representatives on behalf of their respective clients and con-stituents, and I decided to hold the enquiry in private, because I considered that the documents and witnesses necessary to enable me to arrive at the truth would not be forthcoming in a public investigation. I reserved to myself power to direct a public sitting or sittings later if the need should in my judgment arise. I further decided to allow the attendance of legal representatives on behalf of their various clients, but only while those clients and their witnesses were under examination, and I expressed my readiness to avail myself in my discretion of any materials for cross-examination which might be put before me. Finally, I fixed Monday, the 28th August, at Cushendall, for the first siting to hear evidence. The grounds of my decision at this preliminary sitting were reduced to writing at the time, and a copy accompanies this Report.*Between the preliminary sitting and the first sitting to hear evidence I made myself acquainted with Cushendall itself and the surrounding country. I heard the evidence of witnesses at Kilmore, and later at Cushendall, on the 28th, 29th and 30th August, and of witnesses at Belfast on the 31st August, 1st 2nd and 4th September.Before dealing with the events of the 23rd June, 1922, I desire to refer to the general situation in County Antrim at that date. During the month of May a campaign of outrage murders, raids and burnings had been prosecuted with vigour in Northern Ireland by persons in rebellion against the established Govern-ment. In County Antrim alone, between the 17th and 23rd May, twenty-six outrages took place. These outrages included an attack on Cushendall Police Barracks, the robbery and burning of a bank there and the burning of houses and other property in and near the village.   In these circumstances the Government of Northern Ireland[8926]* Mot printed.b
action. It is not suggested by any of the witnesses, except Sergeant Humphreys, hereafter referred to, that the police or military were fired on by the party on the plateau. Both police and military observed a further body of men on the ridge of the hills behind the plateau in the neighbourhood of the spur known as Lurigethan. Major Moss-Blundell saw at least fifty people there. The men and boys who&apos; were among the party on the plateau were called before me, and their evidence was that they had been cutting one another&apos;s hair in a neighbouring farmhouse, and at the time when the tenders arrived were amusing themselves in playing or watching a game called &quot; duck on the table &quot; on the plateau. I am satisfied upon the evidence that they were innocently occupied, but it is clear that in the circumstances they were properly called upon by the police to halt and should have obeyed the order. I am of opinion that, having regard to the known facts about this particular locality, the police were fully justified in requiring the party to halt and in firing upon them when they failed to do so. After this affray the military and police returned to their tenders. Major Moss-Blundell decided, in view of what had happened and of the concentration observed upon the hills, to modify his plan, and, to use his own words, &quot; to lay a trap &quot; in Cushendall. His plan was based apparently on the assumption that there would be a concentration of some part at least of the hostile forces in Cushendall itself, and he was anxious to be ready to surprise them from whatever direction they might attempt to leave the village. He therefore ordered the police tender to go into Cushendall and halt in the centre of the village; Lieut. Hawkins&apos;s tender to go 400 yards down Shore Street; Lieut. Bulfin&apos;s tender to go 400 yards down Mill Street; while he himself was to halt at the E.U.C. Police Barracks in Bridge Street. A reference to the map marked &quot;D &quot; sent with this report* will show these places.Before the party resumed their journey after the Foriff episode, James McAllister came round the corner from the Cushendall direction on a bicycle. He was stopped, interrogated by Sergeant McLean, and taken up into the police tender with his bicycle. I am satisfied that Sergeant McLean was amply justified in taking the lad up into the tender; indeed, it was his duty to do so. I am on the other hand equally satisfied that McAllister was engaged on an innocent journey at the time. Sergeant McLean admitted that he gave the name McAllister at once, though the Sergeant is not sure about the Christian name. The rest of the evidence satisfies me that McAllister had been to Waterf oot in order to buy a paper and some cigarettes (which were found on him by the police), and was returning to his home, which is situated in a by-road just beyond For iff on the far side from Waterf oot: he had been advised by friends in Waterfoot to wait because of the firing, but went on because he thought that it was not so near as in fact it was, and in order that his mother might, not be worried by his failure to return. The tenders, after picking up McAllister, proceeded to Cushendall.The two last tenders can be dismissed at once. The fourth under Major Moss-Blundell halted as arranged at the .R.U.C. Barracks : the third, under Lieut. Bulfin, owing to a mistake, turned to the left down the Ballyeamon Road before reaching the bridge, and only arrived at the Diamond after the firing was over. The police tender passed through the Diamond up High Street, stopped and came back slightly down the hill, halting finally about opposite the Post Office on the Curfew Tower side. Sergeant McLean at once jumped down to direct the next two tenders. Before the police tender arrived there had been a small concourse of men and girls at the Diamond; it was just before 11 P.M., the Curfew hour, and it was the custom of the inhabitants to collect and gossip at the Diamond each night at this time, running to their houses when they heard the step of the Curfew patrol approaching along Bridge Street from the R.U.C. Barracks. As the police tender came into the Diamond, the inhabitants there assembled began to scatter. Firing broke out at once, and there is the sharpest possible conflict of evidence as to who began it and as to whether anyone, except the police and the soldiers, ever fired at all. The evidence of the inhabitants of Cushendall given by witnesses who were in the Diamond or were at their doors or windows in the High Street and in Shore Street  is overwhelmingly in favour of the view that there was no firing until the police, jumping immediately from their tender, began it, and that throughout no person except the police and the military fired. The police, on the other hand, state that two or four shots were fired on them, and that they then dismounted, took cover and fired in reply along Shore Street and up High Street, the direction from which they were fired on.[8926]* Not printed.E 2
I have weighed carefully and with much deliberation the evidence on both sides. My conclusion is that no one except the police and the military ever fired at all. I accept the evidence of the main body of the civilian witnesses : in particular, I was impressed by the testimony and demeanour of Miss Macauley, the postmistress, and Mrs. Hamill. Mr. Foster, and Mr. Allen, the Bank Manager, who were in the Temperance Hotel together, overlooking the Diamond, spoke of two or more shots before the police opened fire, but they were judging solely by ear, and it is to be noted that Mr. Allen in his statement to D. I. Silcock on the day following the incident, did not say that the first shots were fired by persons other than the police, but simply that, after he had retired into a back passage, he heard a number of shots being fired, and then machine-gun shots. The only other civilian witnesses who suggest that there was firing by persons other than the police are Mrs. Ryall and her maid, Miss Wallace. Both were, in my judgment, honest witnesses; but Mrs. Ryalhs evidence was exclusively hearsay, while Miss Wallace has, in my opinion, allowed her imagination to get the better of&quot; her memory.Except as to part of the evidence of Constable Carruthers, referred to below, I am unable to accept the evidence of the special constables from Ballymena. Having regard to the position of the military tenders, when firing began, I cannot obtain much assistance from the officers or Sergeant Humphreys of the Green Howards as to how it began. The two bullets which Lieut. Bulfin heard when his tender was by the R.TJ.C. Barracks were, according to his evidence, not fired from the direction of the village itself, but from the high ground to the south of the village. Firing had already broken out when Lieut. Hawkins came through the Diamond into Shore Street to take up his allotted post, and his tender at once came under fire from the police. But he and his sergeant (Sergeant Humphreys) assert positively that they saw civilians turning and firing revolvers as they ran into their houses in Shore Street. Sergeant Humphreys, indeed, says that lie saw eight or nine men firing in the Diamond at the police at five yards range from their tender, some three civilians using rifles and the remainder revolvers. I am satisfied that Lieut. Hawkins like Lieut. Bulfin, was endeavouring to tell me all that he observed to the best of his recollection; but it is to be noted that shortly after the occurrence he was unable to say who began the firing, while, as to the subsequent shooting I am of opinion that in the confusion, inevitable when firing takes place in a village, he was mistaken in stating that he saw men firing at him, though no doubt some of the civilians turned to look behind them as they ran into their houses. I cannot attach any weight to the evidence of Sergeant Humphreys. He alone suggests, and indeed asserts positively, that the police were fired on in the Foriff episode, and in face of. the rest of the evidence I cannot accept as accurate his story of the close range firing by civilians in the Diamond. I am assisted in reaching my conclusion on this question by the evidence of Constable Carruthers of the Ballymena Special Police : he jumped down from the first tender when firing began and went to the corner of Shore Street. There he saw some of the inhabitants standing in their shirt-sleeves at the doors of their houses. He took them for law-abiding citizens, ordered them indoors, and fired a few rounds into the air.. He then assumed a. kneeling position and waited in readiness facing down Shore Street, but did not fire another shot. It is further to be observed that no arms or ammunition were discovered by the military or police, that apart from a very slight wound received by Lieut. Hawkins from the splash of a bullet (which might quite well have been fired by the police) there was no casualty among the military or the police, and that there was no sign of any bullet mark upon any of the tenders. Moreover, the only bullet marks to which my attention was directed were upon the wall coloured pink at the top of High Street, in the alley-way running from Shore Street between McGonnelhs and McAllisters shops, and on houses in Shore Street almost opposite the Glens of Antrim Hotel: it is obvious that these marks must have been the result of firing by the military or police. Further it is not probable that fire would be opened from the top of High Street or from Shore Street against forces in the Diamond when sympathisers with the fixers were collected there.I think that the civilian witnesses probably exaggerated the duration of the firing and that it only lasted some five minutes. I cannot accept the view that there may not have been some few stray shots after the main firing was over : the evidence of Sergeant Lunney of the local R.U.C. confirms me in this opinion. ^I have now stated my conclusions as to the circumstances in which firing took place at Cushendall on the night of the 23rd June, 1922, and it becomes necessary to consider in detail the manner in which James McAllister, John Hill and John Gore met their deaths.  My findings are as follows : 
James McAllister was left in the first tender when the police jumped down to fire. In my opinion, at some time during the next five minutes, he was dragged down from the tender by two special constables, and to- use the language of one of the witnesses, &quot;trailed along &quot; across the Diamond into Shore Street screaming (again in the words of several of the witnesses), &quot; For God&apos;s sake not to shoot him.&quot; dragged up the alley-way between McGonnelPs and McAllister&apos;s shops and there shot through the mouth at or near the doorway into McMullan&apos;s premises. The evidence of Sergeant Lunney, Dan Rowan and Dr. 0&apos;Kane satisfies me that McAllister was shot at very close range, and this circumstance makes it the more extraordinary that no special constable could give me any real assistance as to McAllister&apos;s movements from the time when he was left in the lorry at the Diamond until his death.Earlier in the evening John Gore, his&apos; brother Pat Gore, Lily McGonnell (a girl of 15), Pat McAllister (the blacksmith&apos;s son, not related to the lad McAllister who was killed), and a girl named Maggie Macdonald had been dancing on the beach to a mouth-organ. They returned about 10-30 up Shore Street in the direction of the Diamond. When the firing began, they had reached the burnt bank, which is almost opposite McGonnelfs shop. Pat Gore ran up the alley-way between McGonnelFs and McAllister&apos;s shops, turned to the left through the side door into the kitchen of McGonneLFs shop and ran upstairs to a bedroom, Lily McGonnell ran through the front of the same shop into the kitchen, John Gore ran into the shop and remained there. John Hill, who had been talking to James McAllister, the blacksmith, at the Diamond, ran after Lily through the shop into the kitchen, James McAllister ran into the shop where he and John Gore hid behind the counter on the left side. John Hill and Lily McGonnell ran out to the coalhouse at the&apos; back. As to what followed I accept the evidence of Pat Gore, Lily McGonnell and James McAllister. Before accepting their evidence I have paid careful regard to what was said by some of the local police as to their credibility. Two special constables entered the shop. One went up stairs and brought Pat Gore- down to the kitchen, the other went to the coalhouse and fetched Lily McGonnell and John Hill from the coalhouse to the kitchen. The constable who&quot;had brought Pat Gore down left him with the other two in charge of the second constable, and went out through the side door into the alley-way, but re-entered the shop by the front door. In the shop he called out : &quot; Is anyone here ? &apos;&apos; He repeated this several times. The blacksmith squeezed John Gore&apos;s legs as he laid beside him to induce him not to move, but the lad became nervous, jumped up with his hands over his head, and said, &quot;I am here.&quot; The constable then shot him with his revolver across the counter, the bullet passing through the left breast and coming out at the back of the right shoulder blade. The blacksmith lay still, and the constable went up the three stairs through the glass doors leading into the kitchen. Meantime, the other constable had been interrogating John Hill, Lily McGonnell and Pat Gore. They all admitted that they were Catholics. John Hill explained that he was a motor driver, where he worked and lived, and that he had come into the shop&apos; when the lorries arrived. The special constable who had shot John Gore, on coming into the kitchen searched Pat Gore putting his revolver against Gore&apos;s teeth; Gore explained that he was an ex-soldier. The same constable then took John Hill out through the side door into the alley-way and shot him in the chest, the bullet passing through the body and coming out in a large exit wound at the back.It is unnecessary here to pursue the story of Pat Gore&apos;s identification of his brother and of his own escape. But I would observe that his evidence gains considerably in weight by reason of the fact that it is supported in important particulars by the independent evidence of Thomas McConnell, one of the local R.U.C., and by an admission made by Lieutenant Hawkins. McConnell agrees that Gore is correct in saying that when he came out of the shop a special constable pointed a revolver at him, and. McConnell intervened, saying: &quot;Don&apos;t shoot that man he is not long out of the army ! &quot; whereupon the special constable said that he &quot;would not think damned much of shooting&quot; McConnell. Lieutenant Hawkins admits that when Pat Gore gave his brothers name and. address he did say (as Gore told me in his evidence): &quot;John Gore of Ashbrook that&apos;s good.&quot; (Lieut. Hawkins thought erroneously that this was an identification of a man known to be disaffected.)i was invited, on behalf of the special constables, to take the view that Gore was shot either in the doorway of the shop or through the window, when he was standing behind the counter, by someone firing from the street; that McAllister was trying to escape from the tender and was shot as he ran through the door in the alley-way between the two shops referred to and that both he and Hill were shot as they tried
to escape into the yard by police or military firing up the alley-way.   But except inthe case of Carruthers to the extent already mentioned, I am unable to accept theevidence of the special constables from Ballymena.   I am satisfied that they did nottell me all that they knew about the circumstances in which these three men died,and, in view of the reports made by the military officers at the time, and of the        jevidence given by them before me, I do not believe that none of the police entered any      v&apos;)?of the houses.Apart from the three men who were killed, two young men, Daniel 0&apos;Loan and John McCullum, were wounded by rifle bullets. 0&apos;Loan was hit as he was running down Shore Street away from the Diamond towards his house almost opposite the Glens of Antrim Hotel and badly injured in the thigh, but is recovering now. McCullum was more slightly wounded in the arm as he ran up High Street towards his home. Both these young men (like those who were killed) do not seem to have been connected with any active Sinn Fein organisation and are given by the local police the reputation of being well-conducted, quiet lads. If I had been satisfied that there was sufficient justification for any firing by the Crown Forces, I should also have found that no blame for these men&apos;s wounds attached to any of the police or military, but that they had suffered as a result of the inevitable danger of street fighting.I do not regard myself as either charged with the duty or in possession of sufficient powers or materials to ascertain the responsibility of any individual. In my opinion, there is no evidence that the military forces were in any way to blame. Major Moss-Blundell was ready to assume responsibility for the acts of the special constables temporarily under his command; but I am bound to say that I do not see how any steps could have been taken by him to prevent what occurred. I also desire to make it plain that, in my opinion, no reflection can justly be made upon the conduct of any of the officers or other ranks of the 2nd Battalion of the Green Howards, who were under Major Moss-BlundelFs command. It is a matter of regret though I am satisfied in the circumstances that it was inevitable that neither Captain Porter nor Captain Anderson of the 52nd Platoon was able to proceed with the police in charge of the first tender. Both these officers gave evidence before me, and I feel confident that if either of them had been present he would have been capable of maintaining discipline among the men under him and of preventing the unjustified firing and the excesses which occurred in his absence.I desire to place on record my appreciation of the ungrudging manner in which every department of the Northern Government carried out their undertaking to give me all possible facilities for conducting the enquiry. It was made abundantly plain to me that they desired to assist me in arriving at the truth, whatever I might find the truth to be. Both the civil and military authorities readily disclosed to me all relevant documents, however secret and confidential in character. &quot;Without their generous assistance it would have been wholly impossible for me to have made any adequate investigation.I also desire to express my thanks to my secretary, Mr. Walter Monckton, barrister-at-law, and to the shorthand writer, Mr. J. W. Porter, for the capable and unremitting assistance that they have afforded me in the conduct of the enquiry and in the preparation of this report.I have the honour to be. Sir,Your most obedient servant,F. T. BARRINGTON-WARD.September 9, 1922.o
