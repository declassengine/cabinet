[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty.&apos;s GrovernmentJPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1922. SECRET. 8CP. 4185.CABINET.SPECIAL REPORT  ON   UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 74.     Period ended September 1, 1922.THE SITUATION.Very little change is shown &apos; in the engineering industry; suspensions of workpeople have taken place in the motor trade in the Midlands Division.The iron and steel industry still remains generally slack, but signs of improve-ment continue in the Midlands Division.In the coal-mining industry a tendency for the better is shown, both in Scotland and Wales. The improvement in the North-Eastern Division previously reported is maintained.Shipbuilding and ship repairing is still quiet; in the North-Eastern Division orders are becoming increasingly scarce; a slight revival is, however, apparent in London, owing to the return to work of men unemployed on account of a recent trade dispute.Employment in the cotton and textile industry is good in Scotland; many mills in the North-Western Division, however, have extended the annual holidays. The mills in this Division controlled by the Fine Spinners&apos; Association continue to maintain full production.In Scotland Division and the Midlands Division the position of the hosiery trade is very favourable. The woollen and worsted industries in the North-Eastern Division appear to maintain the improvement previously reported.The building industry appears generally to be becoming quieter with the approach of winter; in the South-Western Division, however, it continues brisk, and some demand for painters and decorators is reported from London.The depression in the linen trade in Scotland continues, with no indication of any improvement. The jute industry in this Division is also showing signs of further slackening off.There is no general resumption of work among pottery workers in the Midlands since the annual holidays, owing to shortage of orders. The lace trade in this Division is also very depressed.Unemployment in the glass trade in the North-Eastern Division is increasing. Some revival of the brick-making industry is reported from the South-Western Division, chiefly on account of materials required for the Halwill-Torrington Light Railway.T. J.

NOTE ON UNEMPLOYMENT  SITUATION IN GREAT BRITAIN ANDIRELAND ON SEPTEMBER 1, 1922.1. The Trade Union figure of unemployment for July 1914 was 2-8 per cent.The average for the ten years prior to the war, according to Trade Union unemployment figures, was 4-7 per cent. It was as high as 7-8 per cent, in 1908 and 7-7 per cent, in 1909.During 1919 it ranged between 1-6 per cent, in September and 3-2 per cent, in December, and averaged 2-4 per cent, for the year.During 1920 it ranged between 0-9 per cent, in April and 60 per cent, in December, and averaged 2-4 per cent, for the year.The figures for 1921 were:To the end of January ...

Workpeople who are unable so to comply are excluded.L-SUMMARY OF ACTION TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT.[From Autumn 1920 onwards.] Cabinet Unemployment Committee.The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, there was a special discussion at a meeting of the Cabinet, when the Cabinet Unemployment Committee was appointed to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the 8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit, extended the periods of benefit and increased the contributions. As from November 1921 the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision for grants in respect of wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed a special levy to provide for these grants. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, which operates as from the 6th April, 1922, amalgamates the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment Insurance contributions, and extends until June 1923 the special periods during which &quot;&apos; uncovenanted &quot; benefit may be drawn. The authority to borrow money from the Treasury is increased to  30,000,000 for Great Britain.Table showing&quot; amount paid out in Unemployment Benefit (including Benefit in respect of Dependants) and the Contributions during the period November 8, 1920, to August 26, 1922.

(B.) Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Report. At least 250,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 88,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits and Trade Facilities Act schemes (see table below).SUMMARY SHOWING THE LABOUR EMPLOYED IN GREAT BRITAIN AT AUGUST 25, 1922, ON CERTAIN OF THE SCHEMES REFERRED TO ABOVE.Scheme.
