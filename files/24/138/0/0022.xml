HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.SUMMARY JURISDICTION  (SEPARATION AND MAINTENANCE) BILL,Memorandum by the Home Secretary.A Bill introduced by Sir Robert Newman to amend the law relating to separation and maintenance orders obtained a Second Reading without a division on Friday, 26th May.    The Bill contains several useful amendments of the existing law, but It also would effect a number of mischievous changes - some of which were evidently not foreseen by the promoters.    The Bill purported to amend the law by repealing the Act of 1895 and re-enaoting its provisions with certain amendments.    By this procedure some of the most drastic changes which would result were obscured.    For example the Bill does not re-enact the provision in the 1895 Aot which imposes a limit on the amount the Court may order to be paid by way of maintenance and thus - without any explicit provision on the subject --upsets  the whole of the existing arrangements for division of jurisdiction between the Divorce Court and the Courts of Summary Jurisdiction and enables the applications for separation whioh are now dealt with in the Divorce Court to be brought before a Court of Summary Jurisdiction,,     Again, the Bill does not re-enact Sections 6 and 7 of the 1895 Act, with the result that adultery would be no bar to a separation order and a wife would be able to commit adultery, get an order against her husband, and live with her paramour at her husband.&apos;s expense.    There are numerous other objections to the Bill, and after careful examination I oame to the conclusion that it was impossible to mahe it satisfactory by amendments in Committee.
iThe amendments required would be so extensive as to convert iti(into a different Bill from that to which a Second Reading ha^Sjbeen given..These difficulties have been pointed out to the promoters ind ultimately they have agreed that they will not proceed with tae Bill, provided the Government will introduce a Bill to effect such amendments of the law as are generally recognized to be desirable.    In order to oarry out this arrangement I ask leave to introduce at onoe the draft Bill attached.The most important provision is that in Clause 1 enabling a wife to apply for an order for separation and maintenance, -although she is still living with the husband&apos;.    The Chief Magistrate, whom I have consulted^agrees with the supporters of Sir Robert Newman&apos;s Bill that the law as It at present stands, undoubtedly inflicts hardship in many oases,  since a &quot; large number of women are unable to leave their offending Husbands because they have no place to go to;    and yet, unless and until a woman leaves her husband, the law can afford her ho protection.Clause 2 will give a court discretion not to discharge an Order despite adultery if,  in the opinion of the Court the adultery was conduced to by the husband&apos;s failure to pay maintenanceClause 3.    By Section.  of the Licensing Act,  1902, tho tact that the husband is a &quot;habitual drunkard&quot;  is made a ground tor a separation order.    The effect of this Clause is to put tiacitual drug-taking on the same footing as habitual drunkenness.Clauses 4, 5 and 6, contain provisions to facilitate the j&amp;iforcement of Orders.    It is well known that hardship is causedii a great many cases by the difficulty of enforcing maintenance ord&apos;All these provisions are taken from the private member&apos;s Billhi oh has already obtained Second Reading and will, I think?Iimmand general assent.
