THIS DOCUMENT  IS THS PROPERTY OF HIS britannic MAJESTY !S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.L.0.35.SCHEME FOR THE BELIEF OF UNEIvLFLO YMEST. MEMORfeSDTTH BY THE MINISTER OF HKALTH.Proposals have from time to time been put before the Unemployment Committee for using money from the Unemployment Insurance Fund for financing schemes of work in preference to the payment of mere cash   benefits.     These schemes have been examined, and one and all rejected for reasons which I need notrecapitulate *I now circulate for the information of my colleagues a scheme which I have   evolved on the basis of suggestions made to me by Captain Donald Simson, of the British Legion, which I think overcomes the most numerous and. most important objections that have been raised against previous schemes.The essence of my proposal is to enable workmen receiving unemployment cash benefits voluntarily to surrender their benefits in return for definite employment at trade wages for a fixed period   the benefits surrendered being paid to employers to enable them to produce cormodities at a lower price and so bridge the already narrow gulf which separates buyers&apos; prices from sellers&apos;prices.The main elements of the scheme are:*1.    Employers would notify the Employment Exchanges of the number of new hands they are prepared to take, on full time,for, a -definite period (six months I in excess of the number employedan the &quot;appointed day&quot;,     (This would presumably have to &quot;be the ate on which the scheme was first made public).2.     In respect of 75$ of such men actually engaged the 15/- per week Unemployment Benefit would be hanaed over to the employer.3.     The 15/- would only be paid in respect of men who had been unemployed for three out of the preceding six months. The cards of such men would be stamped by the Employment Exchange with an indication that the men were eligible for employment under the scheme.The last two conditions taken together go far to meet the objections commonly raised to s chemes of this sort that employers would naturally discharge men at present employed by them in order that they may re-engage them and get the advantage of their Unemployment Benefit;   and that it is undesirable to have workmen working side by side, some of whom are subsidised and others not.    Under this scheme it would be impossible to say which of the new hands taken on were subsidised and which were not.4.     Hew firms set up after the scheme has been made public would, with the exception of bona fide schemes for the employment of unemployed ex-service men. receive the Subsidy &quot; only in respect- of 75% of half the total number of men employed by them.     They would have to be arbl&amp; to prove commitments before the public announcement of the scheme, and would have to start work within, say, three months of the scheme coming   into operation.     Firms proposing fro start new works after the publication of the scheme would be required to give, say, 3 months4135.
notice of their Intention and of the number of men they propose to employ.     This would check the competition of new firms set up merely to take advantage of the scheme.5.     In order that the scheme may come automatically to an end when the need for it has vanished I should propose that every 6 -months after the Appointed day&apos; the percentage of men in respect of whom employers were receiving the Subsidy should, be reduced by a percentage greater then the percentage reduction in total unemployment since, the date when the scheme first began to operate;   the number of men employed under the scheme would, for the purposes of the calculation, have to be Included in the total number of unemployed.     The percentage would be calculated so as to brirg the scheme automatically to an end when the unemployment figures reach whatever is regarded as the normal say, 600,000 adult males.,include al^terlalfco^^^ &apos;\public utility undertakings, in fact every class of employer of labour.I have heard three serious objections to the scheme to which I wish to refer briefly.1.     It would stimulate production by one employer at  he cost of decreasing employment given by other employers.Briefly I think the answer to this is $-hat the objeet of the scheme is to increase the amount of commodities sold. I do not see how this could have any other result than an increase in the total amount of employment.     Whether works&apos;, if any such there be, which are now producing up to their full capacity would be prejudiced by proposals which will have the effect of reducing the price of the commodities they produce depends on many factors, such as the elasticity of demand for the article and the possibility of extensions and improvements of existing works which T have not the necessary data to enable me to discuss.2.     That the scheme would be inequitable as between firm and firm, because on the appointed day one firm might be relatively fully employed on current contracts and temporary orders while another firm through the completion of contracts would have much less than its average number of employees on it a wages list.     The 15% of new hands in the case of the former would necessarily be a much smaller number carrying a proportionately smaller subsidy than the 75% in the case of the latter.     I recognise that this is a difficulty but I should hope   it might be possible to mitigate it on detailed consideration of the scheme;   but whether this is the case or not I think the risk of some inequity as between employers must be traken.     The ideal scheme which shall operate with perfect Justice to everybody is unattainable.3.     The scheme will riot be accepted by the Labour Party. This does not strike me as a serious objection for the following reasons :(a) I am informed that the British Legion would be prepared to support the scheme whole-hea^ifcoiadly.   If it is taken up by the individual workman it is a matter of relatively small Importance whether the Labour Party blessit or damn it.
(b) If the Labour Party decline to bless it, politically they will be In the position of having to suggest an alternative.     This they have not done, and will not, in my judgment, be able to do.(cj The scheme is, in essence, voluntary.     No man can be compelled under it to relinquish his cash benefit In return for work.     The response ma.de to the scheme will be a test of how far the plea of labour for work, not doles,is genuine.     I myself think that It,Is genuine and that the response to these proposals will be proportionately hearty.In any event the scheme can cost nothing and is entirely on a voluntary basis.     If It breaks down at any rate no harm will be done,while, if it succeeds, it will Ipso facto be justified.Finally, I would urge upon my colleagues that the crisis is too serious for schemes for its relief to be looked at mainly from the point of view of finance and economics.Unemployment has been so serious and so continuous that we ave becoming, I will not say callous, but hardened to it, and liable to overlook the demoralisation and hardship to which the unemployed have for many months been subjected?,     The demoralisation may well become a canker sapping the vitals of our Industrial population.I suggest, therefore, that a small Sub-Committee should be immediately set up to report at at. early date to the Cabinet on the measures neceasary to give effect to these proposals oA.
