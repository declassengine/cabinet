Sta?&apos;fT&apos;While we consider it desirable that the Commander-in-Ohlef H    in India and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff should keepconstant and intimate touch with one another by direct correspondence,SECRET. C.P0 4141,
it is essential that the constitutional responsibility and control of the Government of India should be adequately &apos;safe-guarded,..   &quot;&apos;Te accordingly suggest that it should be definitely laid down that direct communications between the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and Commander-in-Chief should be limited to correspondence regarding questions of intelligence, training and preparations for war, and to routine matters and minor questions of organisation and equipment.    It should not extend to questions of principle or policy,, bxit should include any military information required by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff to: enable him to discharge his duties to His His Majesty&apos;s Government.    Executive action should not be taken on such correspondencec      Proposals or final Instructions to the Government of India affecting military policy and the distribu-tion, organisation and equipment of Indian troops or their employment outside India must earaaate from the Secretary of State for India alone.    Copies of all direct commtmi cat ions between the Commander-in-Chief and Chief of the Imperial General Staff should be furnished to the Government of India, the India Office and the lar Office,.Appointment of Lthe Co mm ande r -in-Chief.,*?e suggest that the practice by which the Commander-in-Chief has always been recommended by the Secretary of State for &apos;7ar for appointment by the King, after consultation with the Secre-tary of State for India, might be improved constitutionally if the actual recommendation to the King were made by the Secretary of State for India with the concutrence of the Secretary of State for War*Appointment of ^ecretmry, Military Depovtment,India^Office.(a) The Secretary, Military Department, India Office, should be the adviser of the Secretary of State for India on local military questions.    It is his duty to keep in close touch with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and to keep him thoroughly informed  in regard to all matters that may concern him(b) To enable him to advise the Secretary of State for India on administrative and on local strategic questions,  it is essential that the Secretary, Military Department,  should be an officer of Indian experience, and that he should have recently served on the General Staff at Army Headquarters In India.-.,(c) In order that he may be fully possessed of th - views of the Government of India and the Commander-in-chief^, and in order that he may not lose touch with current developments; &quot;Q recommend that he should visit India during his term of office.Appointment of Military Member of India Oouno110I?.&apos;e recommend that In order to maintain the representative character of the Secretary of Staters Council, the appointment of a military officer of high rank as a Member of the India Council should be continued^,High Command in India,We do not recommend that any change should be made at present, but we consider that as soon as the financial situa-tion permits the question of creating a new appointment of a Civil Army Member should he reconsidered9
Statusi of the Air-Force in India..While we are of opinion that&apos; existing arrangements have not proved satisfactory, we consider that a decision.on this point should be deferred until a Report has boon received from the senior Air Off icer,. who wo recommend should be sent to India to 3tudy under the general direction Of the Commander-in-Chief the use of the Air Force in Indian warfare.Organisation and Administration of the Army in India;(a)   As tho scheme was approved in principle by the Secretary of State for India in his telegram of the 29th September 1920, we have not thought it necessary to study it in detail.     The principles on which their proposals are based are clearly set forth in the despatch of the Government of India, and we consider that the scheme of organisation in four commands is well adapted to the local conditions of India.(&quot;fa)    In the Interests of economy, tho Army should be organised with strict regard to tho limited nature of the duties that it may bo called upon to discharge.     We understand that that principle has been applied to tho troops allotted to internal security duties, the organisation of which, both tactically and admlnistra-tivoly, has been reduced to its simplest form.     It may be that a simpler organisation for the higher tactical formations of the Field Army would meet the requirements of frontier defence. Wo recommend that the Government of India should consider the possibility of effecting economics by that means.(c) We do not consider that we can usefully express an opinion as to tho proposed terms of enlistment, rates of pay and conditions of service.-     Such matters must be dealt with by the Government of India,.(d) We are of opinion that the equipment of the Army in India should be thoroughly modern, and, with due regard to Indian conditions, should be in accordance with the present-day patterns and standards of the British Army, so that when the Army In India has to co-operate with the British Army there may be no avoidable dissimilaritiesVPurpose for vhich the Army in India is Maintained,To consider that the resolution of the Legislative Assembly which Is, in substance, that &amp;he purposes for which the Army is maintained in India are -(a)    The defence of India against external aggression?    and(to)    Tho maintenance of internal order* states concisely and accurately the objects for which tho Army in India exists^Employment of tho Army in India Overseas.(a) We recognise that the Indian Army cannot be treated as if it were absolutely at the disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government-for service outside India.(b) We consider that the principle should be generally accep-ted that, except In the gravest emergency, the Indian Army should be employed outside the Indian Empire only after consultation with the Governor-Gencral-in-Council.Provision of Overseas Garrisons In Time of Peace.We share tho view of the Government of India that the Indian Army should not be required permanently to provide large
oversea garrisons.     ^o re cowmen d that units required for such purposes should he maintained in addition to the establishment laid down for the Indian Army, and that the whole cost, direct and indirect, of ^recruiting and maintaining, such units should be borne by Eis Kajesty :c Government, or by the dependency or colcsay requiring their services.Forces required for Maintenance of Internal Order,In the face of the evidence given by the official *7itnesse3 who are responsible for the government of India, as woll as by certain unofficial witnesses, we do not feel justified in recommending any reduction cither in tho oggregato number of troops allotted to internal security or in the proportion of   -British troops British troops assigned to that duty.yrflpqajtffi-&apos;,.,fro..yeise Armed Police in the Provinces tq replace..    fio^lja^Trpo^l^Fe recognise that the Government of India must be the judge as to tho practicability of establishing such forces %   but we suggest that this proposal requireb -further  aid detailed consicU oration by the Secretary of State for India and the Government of IndianSj^?stitut?:.on of the Territorial Fox^ce for Regular T-v^pn ^?ro do not desire to discourage the legitimate aspirations &quot;of Indians to take an active part in tho defence of their country. Fc therefore recommend that the experiment of creating a Territorial Force should be continued, in selected localities, but that the number of units  should be limited to twenty battalions with ,ancillary services, and that the maximum strength of the Force     &apos;. should not exceed 20,000 of all ranks.      The movement f4iou.ld.be kept under close supervision, and if there are any indications of en attempt to use the force for political purposes, or If a reasonable standard of military efficiency is not maintained, the units affected should at once be disbanded.Substitution of the Auxiliary Force for Regular Troops^Fc  chare the view of Loi^d Rawlinson*s Committee that from the nature of its: terms of service the Auxiliary Force cannot replace regular troops for internal sec\irity- duties, but we think that in   time of internal disorder it-1fill have considerable military value. ^Policy in regard to Fagiristan.(a)   ?re are of opinion that at the present time it would not bo safe to relax our control over Waziristan.
^b) As at present advised;, ^e are unable to recommend for acceptance the latest pro:op,s,Als of the Government of India,      &quot;Ye should like to seS/p^1/ adhered to and the pro-gramme of roads construction recommended by the General Staff completed; hut, as communications.are still passing between the Government of India and the Secretary of State on the subject,, and. other possibilities have, we understand, been suggested, we make no definite recommendations.Proportion of British to Indian Troops.We recommend that no change should at present he made in the proportion of British to Indian troops,Co-operation of Air Force.We recommend that the use of the Air Force in Indian warfare be further studied under the direction of the Commander-in-Chief by an an Air *Offleer of high rank selected by the Secretary of State for Air on the advice of the Chief of the Air Staff; for we believe that this arm contains the possibility of great developments and should eventually render possible considerable economies.Proposed He-establishment of Punjab Frontier ForceaThe question of the re-establishment of the Punjab Frontier Force is an administrative question which requires intimate knowledge of the Indian Army and familiarity with local conditions to enable an opinion to he formed in regard to it.    &apos;Ve do not therefore offer any advice on the subject.,&quot;   The Government of India will, 6&apos;f course, consider the views expressed by Lord Rawllnson^s Committee.Possibility of Reduetion of^Troops in consequence of Tmpfoverents in Military&apos; Equipment, &amp;c0We share the view of Lord Rawlinson1s Committee that there is at present no possibility of reducing the troops in consequence of Improvements in arms and military equipment.Strength of Army in India,We are of opinion that no further deduction of the armed forces of the Crown, whether British or Indian, is immediately possible.    We accept the recommendation of the Government of India, contained in their despatches No,13 of February 1921 and No%70 o^ August 1921, as to the establishment of the Army in India.&apos;* reinforce or cement 3^ from hhgland,we recommend that the requirements of India for reihforce-ments ,frp.m England should be reviewed.     We. suggest that they. riight perhaps more appropriately be calculated in numbers of regiments and battalions rather than in numbers of divisions, *n view of the unmartial character of many of the races of India, battalions composed of ex-service officers and men specially raised for the purpose might he equal to all the demands that fould he made upon our troops in suppressing a rebellion.
D i sb andment of Ineffloi on t Bat tali onsHaving regard to the views expressed by the Government of India,,  we are unwilling to make a definite recommendation for the immediate disbandment of these battalions; but in view of the urgent need for economy in military expenditure; we recommend that the question should be reviewed again as soon as the poli-tical situation In India improves.fndiani s at ion o f the Indian Army.(a) &apos;5?e are unable to approve the latest scheme of the Government of India,    The most that we  can recommend is thatan experiment sh-uld be made by selecting four units of cavalry or infantry, to be officered by Indians, and no promise should be made of further Indianisation unless and until that experiment has proved successful(b) &quot;!e concur in the proposal of the Government of India that a military college should be established in India for the training of Indian  cadets destined for service in the Indian Army, in view of the admittedly unsatisfactory results of the experiment of admitting Indian cadets to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, without previous trainingsContr ibi t tion from Native St a tes ..yWe consider that the States cannot fairly be asked to make any further contribution towards the maintenance of the Army in British India.,2.
