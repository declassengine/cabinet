THIS gOCpi-aMj IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE, Third Session, Gevena 1921. Proposed action on draft Conventions and Recommendations.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.Jocret    1.     As the Cabinet are aware, the Third Session of the Interna-117.      tional Labour Conference, established by Part XIIT of the Treaty of Versailles, adopted in October--November last , seven draft conventions and eight recommendations relating to the following sub jects :-DRAFT CONVE NT IONS.(1(3(4 (5(6(7Draft Convention concerning the age for the admission of children to employment in agriculture.Draft Convention concerning the rights of association and combination of agricultural workers.Draft Convention concerning.workmen&apos;s compensation in agriculture.Draft Convention concerning the use of White Lead in painting.Draft Convention concerning the application of the weekly rest day In industrial undertakings.Draft Convention fixing the minimum age for the admission of young persons to employment as trimmers and stokers.Draft Convention concerning the compulsory medical examination of children and young persons employed at sea.RECOMMENDATIONS.(1) Recommendation concerning the prevention of unemployment in agriculture.(2) Recommendation concerning the protection before and after childbirth of women wage-earners in agriculture.(3) Recommendation concerning night work of women in agriculture.(4) Recommendation concerning night work of children and young persons in agriculture.(5) Recommendation concerning the development of technical agricultural education.(6) Recommendation concerning the living-in conditions of agricultural workers.(7) Recommendation concerning social insurance in agriculture.(8) Recommendation concerning the application of the weekly rest day in commercial establishments.
The draft Conventions and Recommendations have been printed as a Command Paper Mo. 1612 of 1922.2.     Under Article 405 of the Treaty of Versailles, the Members of the International Labour Organisation are required to bring the draft Conventions and Recommendations before their respective competent authorities for legislation or, other action within a period of 12 months o^ at most, a period of eighteen months from the close of the Session of the Conference.     The period of twelve months expires on 19th November,and, even if exceptional circumstances may be held to have prevailed to prevent the re-quisite action being taken under the Treaty before that date , any necessary action must be taken by 19th. May at the latest. 3.     It is not necessary to enter into the question as to who is the competent authority for the purpose of Article 405.     It is anticipated that no difficulty in this respect will arise if the course adopted with respect to the draft conventions and recom-mendations of the Washington and Genoa Conferences of 1919 and 1920 is followed and a Motion is presented to the House of Commons, as follows&quot;That this House approves the policy of H.M. Government respecting the several draft conventions and Recommenda-tion3 of the International Labour Conference at Geneva in 1921.&quot;4.     We are being pressed to give an opportunity for a discussion in Parliament, and it would&apos;appear desirable that, in anticipation of a debate, I should -obtain the approval of the Cabinet to the policy which I suggest should be adopted in regard to the draft Conventions and Recommendations in question.5.     The policy for which I now ask the approval of the Cabinet is based mainly on decisions of the Interdepartmental International Labour Committee which met at Montagu House on Tuesday, 27th June, under the Chairmanship of Sir MontagueBarlow, when the draft Conventions and Recommendations of the Geneva
Conference were considered in detail.     In certain instances, however,   where the Committee were unable to arrive at a unanimous decision, I have Indicated the course which, in my view, should be followed.6,     Conventions.     Dealing with the Conventions seriatim, I make the following proposals:-(l) Draft Convention concerning the age for admission of children to employment in &quot;agricultu.re.This draft Convention prohibits the employment of children under the age of 14 years during hours fixed for school attend-ance;   employment at other times must not be such as to prejudice their attendance at school.     Exceptions are made in the case of practical vocational instruction, provided the total annual period .of school attendance is not.^reduced.     Work done by children in technical schools is also excepted under certain conditions.     The Government Delegates  (Sir Montague Bar low and Sir Daniel Hall) voted for the draft Convention.So far as concerns England, legislation which gives effect to the draft Convention is now in force, because, since 1st July^ Section 8 (1) of the Education Act, 1918, has come Into operation. Further examination of the question since the voting took place has shown that in Scotland, on the other hand, exceptions exist&apos; in the case of children between 13 and 14 years of age who have been exempted by the Local Authorities from the obligation to attend school, and In a lesser degree In the case of children under 13.     Under existing Scottish law, it is thus within the discretion of the Local Authorities in Scotland, and not of the Executive, as to whether the requirements of the draft Convention.--shall be observed.     To give complete effect to the draft Convention in Scotland the introduction of new legislation would&quot; be necessary and the whole question of the operation of the Education Act in England would be liable to be reopened.     This
danger more than outweighs the advantage of introducing such legislation.H.M. Government might, in these circumstances, ratify the Convention,but make a reservation In respect of the position In Scotland.     There are, however, many obvious objections to a policy of ratification with exceptions, and I believe the Cabinet to be opposed in principle to this method of dealing with the difficulty.I therefore propose that the House of Commons should be informed that the Government are in agreement with the provisions of the draft Convention, which represents the existing law in England, and would be in favour of its ultimate ratification.     The enforcement of the law in Scotland is, however, in the hands of the Local Authorities. The Government are unwilling to adopt the policy of ratifi-cation with reservations,and accordingly they oannot rat ify the draft Convention as it at present stands.     They there-fore propose to invite the International Labour Organisation to consider the possibility of amending the draft Convention In order to bring it into stricter conformity with the existing provisions of British lag.(2) Draft Convention concerning the rights of association and combination of agricultural workers.&quot;This draft Convention is intended to secure to workers engaged in agriculture the same rights of association and combina-tion as are enjoyed by industrial workers.     The Government Delegates voted for the draft Convention.As existing legislation makes no distinction between agri-cultural and industrial workers and no new legislation would be required -I propose that H.M. Government should announce their intention to ratify.
(3 ) flp&amp;ft Convention concerninr, Workmen &apos; a Cornpens at ion in Agriculture&quot;.Members of the International Labour Organisation who ratify this draft Convention undertake to extend to agricultural wage earners their lajts and regulations which provide for the compen-sation of workers for personal injury by accident arising out of or in the course of their employment. The Government Delegates voted for the draft Convention.The words &quot;accident arising out of or in the course of their employment&quot; follow the text of the workmen&apos;s Compensation Act, 1906,except that &quot;or&quot; has been substituted for &quot;and&quot;.It is not perfectly clear whether this change was inten-national  or whether it is merely a drafting error.     The Deputy Director of the International Labour Office - and the head of its Diplomatic Division, say that the International Labour Office meant in preparing the Draft to follow the existing English law verb at inuH.M. Government should, therefore, in my view, announce that they consider that the words Inquestion &quot;accident arising out of or in the course of their employment&quot; contain a verbal error.     On this basis they are prepared to ratify the draft Convention,but be foreieffecting ratification it is necessary that the drafting error should be amended at a future Session of the International Labour Conference. I ask authority to make the above announcement.(4 ) Draft Convention concerning the use of White Lead in painting. This draft Convention Is intended to:-(a) Prohibit, with certain exceptions, the use of white lead,or sulphate of lead or other products containing these pigmentsin the internal painting of buildings.
(b) Prohibit, with certain exceptions, the employment of males under eighteen years of r.ge and all females in any painting work of an industrial character involving the use of white lead, or sulphate of lead or other products containing these pigments, (c ) Regulate the use of these pigments by a series of provisions which prescribe the conditions under which the work shall be done .(d) Provide that statistics with regard to lead-poisoning., among working painters shall be kept.The provisions in (a) and (b ) come into operation on 20th November, 1927, while those in  (c ) and (d) become operative not later than 1st January, 1924.      The Government Delegates voted for the draft Convention, but on the basis that, and in so far as, it was an agreed compromise.On the draft Convention as a whole the Home Office state that legislation will be required should It be decided to ratify the draft Convention.     They would prefer that no announcement be made as to the policy of H.M. Government until they have received the report of the Departmental Committee which is at present examining the question of the use of white lead in buildings.     It is expected that the Departmental Committee will report before the end of the present session, and will not be opposed to the general conclusions of the Conference.I therefore suggest that His Majestyrs Government should announce that the Departmental Committee is expected to   &apos; 2 i before the end of the present session and that a further statement will be. made as soon as circumstances permit.(5) Pgggt Convention concerning the application of the Weekly Rest in Industrial Undertakings.&apos;   .This draft Convention is intended, subject to certain
total or partial exceptions, to secure to workers In industrial undertakings one day of rest of 24 hours in every period of seven days.When the draft Convention was adopted, the British Govern-ment delegates voted against it because inter alia it introduced a clause providing for compensatory rest periods.    I still retain my strong objection to the draft Convention on this ground, as the question of compensatory rest periods is bound to re-open wage difficulties, e.g,, on the railways.    The definition clause is also highly unsatisfactory.    Apart from these points, however, I think that the time is highly inopportune for a suggestion that the Government contemplate the introduction either in the present session or in the near future, of industrial legislation which would affect the conditions of employment as already agreed upon between representatives of employers and workpeople, especially as there has been absolutely no general demand for such action either from workpeople or employers in this country.Subject to the concurrence of the Home Secretary, I therefore propose to say that the Senior Government Delegate, Sir Montague Barlow (who was the Chairman of^ the Committee dealing with this subject), had made it clear during the discussion on the draft Convention both in Committee and in the Conference that the British Government anticipated difficulties if certain clauses were incorporated, and when, in spite of his objection, the clauses had been inserted, had voted against the draft Convention.    These difficulties especially at the present time, are as formidable as before, and as there is and has been no general demand from repre-sentatives organisations whether of employers or workpeopie in this country for Governmental interference with the agreed conditions of employment on the lines suggested in the Con-vent ion. H.M.Government regret that, at any rate at present,
they cannot ratify the draft Convention in its existing form.(-6,) Draft Convention fixing the minimum age for the admission of young persons to employment as trimmers&apos; and stokers.(7) Draft Convention concerning the compulsory medical examination., of chilHren and&apos; young persons employed at sea.The first of these draft Conventions prohibits the employmentof any person under the age of 18 years as trimmer or stoker, whilethe second makes compulsory, except in urgent cases, the medical examination of all children or young persons under 18 years of ageemployed on board ship, such medical examination to be repeated atleast once a year.    The Government Delegates voted for both draftConventions.On their merits I am of opinion that both draft Conventionscan he ratified, but that the present moment is inopportune forthe introduction of the necessary legislation.      The. Board of Tradereport, however, that they propose to introduce next year ageneral Merchant Shipping Bill in which clauses to give effect tothese draft Conventions might find a place.It is suggested accordingly that H.M. Governmentshould announce that they are prepared to ratify bothdraft Conventions and that legislation to give effectthereto will be introduced when a general MerchantShipping Bill is introduced next year.Summarising the position as regards the draft Conventions it willbe seen that I ask Cabinet authority -for ratification of three draft Conventionsrelating respectively to -i, rights of association of agricultural workers:ii. fixing the minimum age for the admission of young persons to employment as trimmers and stokers:iii. concerning the compulsory medical examination of children and young persons employed at sea.
B. for the rejeotion of one draft ConventionRelating to the application of the Weekly Rest in industrial undertakings.c* .^0. ^Qserve a decision^ on one dxaft Convention.relating to the use of white lead in painting;    and d. to refer back to the International Labour Organisation for amendments two draft donvenTlons-relating respectively to -1.   the age for admission of children to employment in agriculture.2.   Workmen&apos;s compensation in agriculture. 8.     RBCOMMENDATIOHS.     As s/tatad above, eight Recommendations were adopted at the last Session of the International Labour Conference.   The Government are not required to ratify Recommendations;   a aeo o mine nd&amp;t ion is submitted to the Members for consideration with a view to effeot being given to it by national legislation or otherwise,but it is generally accepted that a greater latitude is permissible for Heoommendationsthan In the case of draft conventions.Dealing with the Recommendations seriatim I make the following proposals;-(i)   Recommendation concerning the prevention of unemployment in&apos;agricultureTThis Recommendation asks Members of the International Labour Organisation to oonsidar certain measures for providing against unemployment amongst agricultural workers and to examine particularly the advisability of adopting, e.g.,modern technical methods of cultivation, intensified cultivation, schemes of land settlement, schemes for temporary work, supplementary work and creation of Agricultural Yorkers&apos; Co-operative Societies.     The Government Delegates voted for the Recommendation.
There would he no difficulty in accepting the recommendation to consider each and all of the suggested methods of dealing with unemployment and to report to the International Labour Office any action which it may ba found possible to take.      The preamble to the Recommendation, however, contains the phrase &quot;consider-ing that the draft Oonvontions and Recommendations concerning unemployment adopted at Washington are in principle applicable to agricultural workers&quot;, and the reference thus indirectly made to unemployment insurance gives rise to a difficulty.As the Cabinet are aware, agriculture is one of the industries excepted from the scope of the various statutory provisions for unemployment insurance, and there is no present intention of extending those measures to cover agriculture.      This was made clear to the Geneva Conference by Sir Daniel Hall, who was Chairman of the Commission concerned in the preparation of the Recommendation.     On the other hand, the Covern-ment, on the strength of existing legislation, and without making any express reservation in favour of agriculture, accepted in 19S1 three out of the four articles of the very general Washington Recommendation of 1919.    Two of the Articles so accepted,  fa.g., as to the provision of Employment Exchanges and the co-ordination of public work) are applicable to agriculture, while the third provides that &quot;each Member of the International labour Organisation establish an effective system of Unemployment Insurance&quot;.      In the Conference Sir Daniel Hall referred
to those Washington provisions as to unemployment which clearly apply to agriculture and which GreatBritain had already accepted:    and said that thisbrought agriculture within tho ambit of theWashington Rooommendation, but so far as the partlcu-lar question of insurance against unemployment was concerned, the application of that to agrioulture mustbe considered by each state on Its merits.In the oiroumstanoes I propose not to accept this Recommendation until it has been made clearthat while it may apply in principle to agri-oulture, It does not apply in detail to theinsurance against unemployment of agricultural workers.    If the Gonferenoe agree that by accepting it H.M.Go?ornment are not committed toextending to agricultural workers the existing provisions of British law relating to unemploy-ment insuranoe, I see no objection to ultimateacceptance.    If the Cabinet concur in this view,I will instruct the Government Delegates to raisethe matter at a future Session of the Conference.(II) Recommendation concerning the protection before and after childbirth of women wage earners In agrioulture.This Recommendation asks Members of the Interna-national  labour Organisation to take measures to ensure to women agricultural wage-oarners protection similar to that provided by the Washington Maternity Convention. The Government Delegates abstained from voting on this Recommendation.   For reasons already given in the House and elsewhere, H.M. Government have declined to ratify the fashington Convention and cannot, therefore, accept this Recammandation.
It is suggested accordinglythat,.H.M. Government.ahould announce that while existing legislation makes no distinction between agricultural and industrialwage-earners and ensures to women wage-earners a com-parable degree of protection, it does not follow the1 ine of the Washington Draft Convention or the Recommenda-tion under reference.    They propose accordingly not toaccept the Recommendation.(i i i ) Re comm. e ndation concerning night work of women in agricuTture.This Recommendation asks Meabers of the InternationalLabour Organisation to take steps to regulate the employmentof women wage-earners during the night in such a way as toensure to them a period of cessation- of employment compatible with their physical necessities, and - consisting of not lessthan nine hours which shall if possible be consecutive.    TheGovernment Delegates voted for the Recommendation.The provisions of this Recommendation are covered substan-tially by existing custom.    Certain exceptions exist, however,which would render legislation necessary to give completeeffect to the Recommendation.     Such legislation would be controversial and troublesome and no demand exists for legisla-tion,and the exceptions are not sufficiently important tojustify its introduction.It is suggested accordingly that H.M.Governmentshould announce that, they are prepared to accept theRecommendation, because, subject to a few unimportantexceptions, its provisions are already carried out by existing custom.(iv) Recommendation concerning night work of children and young persons in agriculture.This Recommendation consists of two parts, the first dealing with children, the second with young persons.
The first part deals with the employment of children under the age of fourteen years ,and recommends that steps be taken to regulate their employment during the night in such a way as to ensure them a period of abstention from work compatible with their physical necessities and con-sisting of not less than ten consecutive hours.The second part contains an analogous provision with respect to the employment of young persons between the ages of fourteen and. eighteen years, recommending in this case a period of rest consisting of not less than nine consecutive-tive hours.In view of the difficulty, referred to below, with regard to the second part, the Government Delegates ab-stained from voting.No difficulty, however, arises in the case of the first part of the Recommendation dealing with the employ-ment of children under fourteen years of age.    In this case, as in that relating to night work for women in agriculture, existing custom is generally in accord with the provisions of the Recommendation.The second part, dealing with the employment of young persons between the ages of 14 and 18 years, is intended to secure to them a period of rest not less than nine consecutive hours.    Here existing custom, at any rate so far as youths between the ages of 14 and 18 are concerned, is probably not so rigid as the rule laid down in the Recommendation.    The need for regulation of this kind is not felt in this country, and acceptance of the Recammendia-tion would involve the Introduction of legislation for which there is no demand,w* jL 5 ***
I suggest accordingly that H.M. Government should announce that they are prepared to accept this Recora-mendation in so far as it applies to children of either sex or to female young persons.   In.view of the diffi-culty referred to in the previous paragraph, they do . not propose to accept the Recommendation in so far as it applies to male young persons between 14 and 18 years of age.(v) Recommendation concerning the development of technical agricultural education.This Recommendation provides that each Member of the International Labour Organisation shall endeavour to develop vocational agricultural education and in particular to make such education available to agricultural wage earners on tho same conditions as to other persons engaged in agriculture.The British Delegates voted  Or? this Recommendation.The acceptance of this Recommendation will not involve any additional legislation or expenditure, as it is sufficiently covered by the existing provision for technical agricultural education.    The second clause of the Recommendation is speci-fically met by Section 3 of the Corn Production Acts (Repeal) Act 1921, which sets up a fund for promoting agricultural development &quot;including the establishment of scholarships and maintenance grants for the sons and daughters of agricultural workmen and others&quot;.It is suggested accordingly that H.M.Governmentshould announce that they propose to accept this Recora-mendstior. having    already made provision along the linesit follows.(vi) Recommendation concerning the living-in conditions of agricultural workers * &quot;This Recommendation asks Members of the International Labour Organisation to take statutory or other measures to regulate the living-in conditions of agricultural workers.-14-
Such,, me-aeur-es- -shall apply to all housing a^xKimmodation provided by employers, and. shall oorrtadn provisions regarding the heating of rooms, provision of separate beds, facilities for ensuring persorial^cleanliness , eto.These provisions could not be accepted in this country without the introduction of fresh legislation and there is no demand for suoh legislation.     In view of these difficulties the Government Delegates voted against the Recommendation.I propose accordingly that EPMCGovernment shouldannounoe that they do not propose to accept the Recommen-dation.(viij   Reoommendation concerning Social Insurance in Agriculture.This Reoommendation requests each Member of the Interna-tional Labour Organisation to extend its laws and regulations establishing systems of insurance against sickness, invalidity, old age and other similar social risks to agricultural wage earners.     So far as sickness, invalidity and old age are concerned, existing legislation is sufficient to enable H.M. Government to accept the Recommendation, but the ambiguity in the phrase &quot;other similar social risks&quot; raises a difficulty, particularly with reference to the extension to agriculture ftf any fixed legislation bearing on this point.     In view of this difficulty, the British Government Delegates abstained from voting at the Conference.&apos;I suggest accordingly that H.M.Government should announce that in view of the ambiguity of the phrase &quot;other similar social risks&quot; they do not propose to accept the Recommendation, making it clear at the same time that so far as siokness, invalidity and old age are concerned, existing legislation makes no distinction between agricultural and other workers, and meets the requirements of the Recommendation.
(viii)     Recommendation flonoernlng the application of the. Weekly Rest in Commercial Establishments.This Recommendation requests each Member of the Interna-tional labour Organisation to take measures to provide thatthe whole of the staff employed in any oommeroial establish-ment should enjoy in every period of seven days a period of24 hours consecutive rest.     Members have power to make excep-tions.     In view of the attitude adopted with regard to thedraft Convention relating to the weekly rest in industrial undertakings and the difficulty that the question of Sundaytrading could not be raised in Parliament without arousingserious controversy, the British Government Delegatesabstained from voting on this Recommendation at the Conference.I propose accordingly that H.M.Goyernment should announce that as the question of Sunday trading would arouse serious controversy, no action by the government can be contemplated at present.9.     Summarising the position as regards Recommendations, I ask Cabinet authority -A. fori the acceptance of two Recommendations *- viz., those concerning -(i) night work of women in agriculture; (Ii ) the development of technical agricultural educstion.B. for the partial aooeptance of one Recommendation - viz.,that concerning ,aight. work of children in agricul-ture, in so far as it applies to children and female young persons.C. for the rejection of four Recommendations - viz. \ those concerning -(i) the protection before and after childbirth of women wage earners in agriculture;(ii) the living-in conditions of agricultural workers;(iii) social insurance in agriculture;
(iv)    the application of the weekly rest day in commercial establishments.D.    for the reference back to the International Labour Organisation of one Recommendation - viz.,that concerning the prevention of unemployment in agriculture.ID.   For convenience of reference I attach a tabular statement showing the action taken by the Government Delegates (Sir Montague Barlow and Sir Daniel Hall) at Geneva when the seven draft Conventions and eight Recommendations were put to the vote, and the proposals which I now make in the matter.21st July, 1922.
