j[This &quot;Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty X Q^vermnent.]&amp; 350 ^Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1922.SECRET. CP. 4168.CANADIAN  CATTLE  EMBARGO.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, correspondence with the Prime Minister of Canada on the subject of the cattle embargo.w. s. c.August 1922.Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to theGovernor-General of Canada.August 15. Please communicate to your Prime Minister following message from me.   Begins : Canadian cattle embargo. You will have seen the result of the recent debates in both Houses of Parliament on this question, and I thank you for the message about them which you have been good enough to send me through Mr. Robb. Owing to my departure on a brief holiday, I very much regret that I have been prevented from, meeting him personally, but I hope to do so on my return.Although the raising of embargo was carried by a majority of 76 in the House of Commons, the opposition to its removal was most formidable, the whole of the landed interests being genuinely perturbed and their influence on the Conservative Party is most powerful. There was great feeling of resentment that pledges should have been given by the Government during the war without consulting Parliament in any way. There was a genuine desire in the House of Lords to meet the Canadian case, but equally to insist upon certain safeguards. In the House of Lords there is an undoubted large majority which could be marshalled against any Bill that did not contain adequate safeguards. In my opinion there is no prospect, except by friendly agreement, of getting a Bill through this Parliament. But I believe that an agreement can be reached which would effectually remove the slur from the Canadian herds and would promote a substantial and immediate importation.The Minister of Agriculture informed the Cabinet that he accepted the mandate of Parliament which he was determined to give effect to, and that no safeguards which were introduced would be devised in an obstructive spirit. I have asked the Minister of Agriculture to set out in a memorandum the ideas which he has at present, and in a separate telegram I have telegraphed a summary of them to you. If you are of opinion that a basis of agreement can be reached by discussion on these lines, will you consider what should be the next step. For instance, would it be a good thing for representatives of Canadian Government or representatives of Canadian, agricultural interests, or both, to come over here, arriving end of September, to meet British Ministers and representatives of British agriculture ? Difficulties would in this way be faced in common and a good scheme worked out in a friendly spirit. The result would probably be an agreed Bill which would slip through quite easily before Christmas. In this matter I have done the very best I could to help, and if you would let me know what your views are I should be very glad.   Ends. Churchill.[3810]
Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to theGovernor-General of - Canada,.August 15. Please communicate following to your Prime Minister.   Begins : Canadian cattle. My telegram of to-day. A Bill is proposed by Minister of Agriculture to remove the statutory prohibition of the importation, except for slaughter, as regards cattle sent direct from any British Dominion subject to such restrictions as. the Ministry may consider necessary for protection against disease and the preservation of the. purity of blood of home-bred stock. Steers would, in the case of Canada,, be admitted into Great Britain as store cattle, subject to seven days&apos; observation in Canada before shipment and a short period of detention for inspection after arrival on this side not exceeding forty-eight hours. Heifers, cows and bulls would be admitted subject to thirty days&apos; observation in Canada and to undergoing tuberculin test before shipment. Subject to slaughter, at the port of landing, fat cattle would be admitted as at present. As regards the three classes of steers, breeding cattle and fat cattle, it would be necessary that, they should be shipped separately and kept separate during observation period before shipment. A small fee not exceeding Is. an animal, and which might be considerably less, would be charged on this side to cover expenses of examination, &amp;c. In the event of outbreak of disease or grave suspicion, it must be understood that British Government retains power to lengthen period of observation or to impose quarantine on this side or temporarily to stop importation altogether.Ends. C.h u kg hill.Paraphrase Telegram from the Governor-General of Canada to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated 21st August.Following message for Secretary of State for the Colonies from my Prime Minister.   Begins : -Your telegrams of 15th instant. My colleagues desire to associate themselves with me in expressing appreciation of your action and of action of His Majesty&apos;s Government regarding the cattle embargo. Without desiring to confine ourselves, as regards any or all of provisions suggested, we believe basis of agreement can be reached by discussion on lines proposed. We concur gladly in suggested meeting to be arranged end of September, but think it preferable for purposes of discussion to confine meeting on both sides to Ministers and officials of, or persons designated by, Government Departments of Agriculture, and, as regards representations of agricultural interests, not to go beyond this. Two Ministers Messrs. Fielding and Lapointe leave to-day to represent Canada at League of Nations Assembly. They could arrange to be in London end of September, and two representatives of Canadian Department of Agriculture, who will be familiar with point of view of Canadian agricultural interests, could join them there. If agreeable, they could at that time meet British Ministers and expert advisers with a view to facing difficulties in common and working out a good scheme in friendly spirit as mentioned in your telegram. Please advise if this course likely to prove acceptable, or do you propose any alternative course&apos;? Mackenzie King.Ends. Byng.
