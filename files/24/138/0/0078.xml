[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government;).Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1922.SECRET.CP. 4179.CABINET.SHORTAGE OF EQUIPMENT OF THE ROYAL AIR FORCE IN INDIA.Memorandum by the Secretary oe State eor Air.1. THE serious disclosures in regard to the condition of the Royal Air Force squadrons in India which have recently appeared in the press make it desirable that I should acquaint the Cabinet with the circumstances which led to the scandalous state of affairs which has undoubtedly existed.2. The dissatisfaction and sense of grievance which the letters to the press reveal have not come as a surprise to the Air Ministry. We had been aware that the financial provision by the Government of India for maintaining the equipment of the Royal Air Force squadrons serving in that country was inadequate, and considerable correspondence, official and unofficial, has taken place on the matter. Moreover, as a result of the ventilation of the subject by the Cabinet Committee on Indian Military Requirements, Sir John Salmond was recently sent to India to study, among other questions, the organisation and administration of the Royal Air Force in India.   His report will shortly be to hand.3. The difficulties originate from a decision by the Government of India, and. notified by telegram on the 27th September, 1920, that all shipments of aeroplanes and engines to India should be suspended. This, of course, meant that the Royal Air Force would have to live upon its reserve stocks until the embargo was lifted. These stocks were then considerable, and the action of the Government of India was, in fact, taken at a time when correspondence initiated by the Air Ministry was proceeding with the India Office proposing a revision in the scale of reserves and replacements for wastage, the ultimate effect of wdiich would be a considerable reduction in the scale of replacements by India. In these circumstances a temporary deferment of further shipments was not open to any grave objection.4. The Air Ministry, however, by a letter of the 13th October, 1920, to the India Office (by whom it was transmitted to the Government of India) pointed out that it was &quot; absolutely essential that all modifications which could in anyway affect safety should be introduced at once.&quot; It was added that these modifications were known as Class 1 modifications, and that when once a particular modification had been approved, Royal Air Force orders prohibited the use of machines affected thereby until it had been incorporated. A further letter was sent on the 4th November, 1920, with detailed suggestions as to the financial provision which should be made in estimates for modifications in the various types of machines.&quot;5. After considerable correspondence, the Air Ministry on the 2nd April, 1921, received an intimation that the Government of India had, on the 10th February, accepted the new7 scales of reserve, but with the proviso that no aeroplanes, engines or spare parts- even for maintenance on the agreed scale should be supplied to India unless specifically indented for by India.6. In point of fact, a complete embargo upon all new supplies was still maintained and the squadrons had to do the best they could on such reserves as they held. The inevitable result was a, decreasing standard of efficiency. The Air Ministry viewed the situation with growing disquiet, but the only source of information open io them were unofficial reports from officers returned from India and private correspondence. I felt, however, that the situation was so unsatisfactory that I decided in December 1921 to communicate in the matter personally with the then Secretary of State for India (Mr. Montagu). . He telegraphed to. the Government of India on the 11th January putting to them specific questions as to the equipment of the Force. The answer received from, the Government of India, (dated the 22nd February) made it clear that the representations of the Air 18857]
Ministry were more than justified. It was admitted that the supply of general stores was only adequate for two weeks&apos; operations with all Squadrons. Information came to hand from another source that certain Class 1 modifications, affecting the safety of machines, had not been incorporated owing to the absence of supplies.,7. The Secretary of State for India telegraphed to the Indian Government on. the 3rd March expressing his alarm at the state of affairs thus disclosed, and asking to be informed what steps had been taken to put air end to a situation which was uneconomical and dangerous. The condition of the Royal Air Force in India had also come before the notice of the India Military Requirements Committee.These representations at length brought the responsible authorities of India to an appreciation of the position of the Air units in that country and we were notified on the 14th April, by telegram dated the 13th April, that the embargo on supplies had been withdrawn and that a cable of indents was being sent of stores most urgently required. Information was also received that provision was being made in the India Budget 1922-23 to bring supplies and reserves up to the authorised standard.8. It cannot, of course, be expected that the unhappy results of a shortage of essential stores will at once be remedied by the measures which have now been taken. The recovery of morale and efficiency cannot be accomplished until the effect of these measures has matured. Nor do I feel that the present system of administration of the Air Force in India affords sufficient safeguard against the recurrence of similar shortages in the future. At present the Air Officer Commanding has no right of access to the Viceroy and is entirely under military authority. Until the Air Officer Commanding is in a position to represent with adequate authority to the highest authorities in India the requirements of the Air Force and to communicate with the Air Ministry in the same way as does the Commander-in-chief in India with the. War Office, it is impossible to ensure either efficiency or safety. The financial departments (whose difficulties in India are, as I appreciate, of the gravest kind) not unnaturally believe that the possibilities of economy in the provision, and of improvisation in the. use, of aeronautical equipment have no limits.Even at the present time, in spite of the disclosures to which I have just referred, the Government of India have refused to sanction an addition to the establislt-ment of personnel of the Aircraft Depot in India which is considered by the Air authorities to be of urgency and second in importance only to the question of deficiencies in technical equipment. These increases were originally accepted by the Government of India itself and sanctioned by the Secretary of State for India in October 1921. Later, the Government of India reversed this decision and the matter still remains unsettled.9. The whole of this unfortunate episode illustrates the danger to aerial efficiency and to the lives of the pilots which arises when a Service of this peculiar complexity is controlled and administered by persons who have no expert knowledge of its special conditions and are too often inclined to regard it with an unsympathetic, or even a jealous, eye. This moral will be emphasised with every addition to the ever-increasing complexity of the Air Service and of the art of flying.10. I may add for the reassurance of the Cabinet that there is no ground for the suggestion which has been made in the press that the types of machines and armament in use in India are unsatisfactory. They are the same as those in use by Royal Air Force squadrons in Iraq, Egypt and at home and are perfectly suitable for the work required of them.It may also be added that the finding of the Court of Enquiry pn the regrettable death of Flying Officer Luard (whose 1&apos;ather&apos;s letter to &quot; The Times &quot; started the correspondence under notice5, which has just come to hand, is that the accident was due to an error of flying judgment on his part and there was no fault in the machine or its fittings which could have contributed to it.F. E. G.Air Ministry,September 1922.
