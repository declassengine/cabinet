I circulate to the Cabinet an appreciation of the situation in Iraq.L. W.-E.The War Office,bth October, 1922.1. The events of the last few weeks in Kurdistan, as depicted in recent telegrams from the High Commissioner and the General Officer Commanding, Iraq, have made it necessary to consider not only the position in Southern Kurdistan, but also the situation of the Imperial troops in Mosul and on the line of communications between Bagdad and Mosul.From the General Officer Commanding&apos;s telegram, No. X. 4828, dated 5th September, 1922, which is reproduced in the Appendix to this memorandum, it is plain that the recent operations have demonstrated conclusively that the Iraq levies, even when stiffened by some Imperial troops and assisted by the Royal Air Force, cannot be relied upon either to punish recalcitrant tribesmen or to meet their attacks when assisted by Turkish personnel and advice. In view of this experience and the impossibility of providing any more Imperial troops to assist the levies, the immediate decision arrived at by the High Commissioner, m consultation with the General Officer Commanding, to withdraw from the Sulaimanieh division and to hold as his most advanced point the line Erbil Kirkuk- Kifri, is the only one possible.2. The effect of this decision, however, on the general military situation at and south of Mosul demands urgent consideration. According to the latest information received from Iraq, the position of Imperial troops and Iraq levies north of Bagdad is as follows : Imperial Troops. Levies.Zakho     ...       ...       ...       ...       ____      ...   2 Companies.Dohuk    ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...   x Battalion (less 2 companies).Mirtdan   ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...   1 Battalion (less 2 companies).Aqra       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...   2 Companies.Erbil -2 Companies Indian Battalion      ...       ...   1 Cavalry Regiment (less ] squadron).Mosul 1 Armoured Car Company (less 2 sections)    1 Cavalry Regiment.1 Squadron Royal Air Force        ...       ...   1 Pack Battery.1 Indian Pack Battery.1 Indian Battalion.

General state,War Office.The line of communication to Baghdad along the Tigris, which is altogether 230 miles long by road and rail, is vital, and the result of the withdrawal from Sulaimanieh and Halebja, now to be carried out, will be to reduce the distance between the covering troops, composed almost entirely of levies, and the Tigris from over 100 miles to some 50 miles.This not only means that the levies will be holding the last position in the hills east of the Tigris which will make the Tigris line of communications safe and give the covering troops sufficient depth in which to fight, bnt also that early information of hostile concentrations and movements, wiu].e still at a distance, will probably not be forthcoming.The withdrawal will remove any influence we may have exerted over the tribes east of the line Kirkuk Erbil Kifri, and we must assume that they will throw in their lot with any hostile bodies which may advance from the east. This aspect of the situation is emphasized in a letter, written by the General Officer Commanding before the recent operations took place, in which he says that a Turko-Kurd success at Rania, such as has actuallj7 occurred, would be very serious.In view of the victory of the Turks in Anatolia, we must also expect the detachments of Turks on the Mesopotamian border to increase their activity, whether the Angora Government wishes it or not.3. The General Staff have throughout objected, to ihe retention of Imperial troops in the Mosul Vilayet, and only agreed to their retention reluctantly on the- express understanding that the conditions outlined at the Cairo Conference came about. None of those conditions have in fact been fulfilled, and the General Staff emphasize once again that the recent events have proved that the retention of Imperial troops in the Mosul Vilayet is unjustifiable unless they are immediately and strongly reinforced, which they know to be impossible.4. It is clear that the levies, on which we were relying to keep the country quiet, are unequal to their task, and that the Royal Air Force, which has worked so hard and done so much to assist the General Officer Commanding in the past, cannot dominate the country single-handed. They may check in the bud individual i*isings, but cannot deal alone with any trouble on a large scale. As the General Officer Commanding has stated, the final decision in war must lie on the ground.If there were sufficient troops to do so, the General Staff, knowing the importance of prestige in the East, would advise the immediate re-taking of Rania ; but, as this is out of the question, and there is a distinct possibility ot the outbreak of a serious rising in Kurdistan at any time, they consider that there is no alternative but to withdraw from the Vilavet of Mosul.,5. They do not, however, advocate that the Cabinet should direct the High Commissioner and the General Officer Commanding to withdraw immediately. An immediate withdrawal at this moment would be likely to encourage the enemy and to precipitate not only a serious state of affairs in Southern Kurdistan, but also cause immediate trouble in Baghdad and even Lower Mesopotamia.At present the instructions are that the troops at Mosul are not to withdraw until attacked, i.e., they are to act as a rearguard. But the present threat to Mosul, by reason of the advance on Altua Kuri, would, if it, developes, be more dangerous than an attack at Mosul, and therefore instructions should be issued leaving the date of withdrawal to the judgment of the High Commissioner and General Officer Commanding in consultation, having due regard to the paramount necessity of not jeopardizing the retirement of the more northern detachments.
APPENDIX.(No. X 4828.) 5th September, 1922.Following are details of Rania incident : On 29th August section Pack Artillery Battery (?) and company 15th Sikhs also Lieut.-Colonel Hughes commanding Ranicol and Staff arrived at Derbend. At 0400 hours, 31st August, Sikh picket south o  Derbend on left bank of Zab was overwhelmed. This accounts for bulk of Sikh casualties. During 31st August Derbend was reinforced by Hughes with whole of levies from Rania. Following then composed his column at Derbend : 1 section Pack Artillery Battery, &quot;C&quot; Company, 15th Sikhs, 4th Bn. Kurdish Levies, less 1 company, Assyrian machine gun platoon and wireless pack set. That night at 2030 hours he started (5 groups omitted) Rania by moonlight and at about 2200 hours column came under hostile fire. The Kurdish levies then got entirely out of hand and with result that there was considerable confusion. Some order was established by daybreak on 1st September and column moved on Rania but found enemy holding it. Hughes then decided to go straight across country to Koi Sa-njak with regrettable result that in the rice fields his (?) mules became badly bogged.This accounts for casualties in 120th Pack Artillery Battery (?) which lost 52 animals and parts of (?) both its guns. There was practically a stampede on the part of the Kurdish levies, and nearly whole burden of withdrawal was borne by Sikhs who gave fine display of steadfastness, and on more than one occasion used the bayonet. During morning of (?) 1st September, enemy attacked from all sides with vigour, riding close up to column. Later, great assistance was rendered by our aeroplanes in covering the withdrawal, and enemy appear to have stopped as soon as he saw he had definitely failed in his attempt to surround column. The column (?) reached ridge immediately north-east of- Koi Sanjak, 2nd September. Lieut.-Colonel Hughes reports that heavy casualties were inflicted on enemy. Following are our casualties :   Regular troops killed-Indian other ranks, 14. Wounded- British officers, 2; Indian officers, 1 ; Indian other ranks, 11. Missing Indian other ranks, 7. Levies, killed and missing 13 ; wounded 19. Horses, killed 11 ; wounded, 3. Mules, killed 64; wounded-9. Evacuation of all wounded being; carried out via Altun Kumob.One company and (?) Machine-Gun Section of 15th Sikhs from Baiji on 1st September reached Koi Saniak. The morale of regulars very high, Kurdish levies quite unreliable. Aeroplanes have daily bombed the enemy, who, however, offers few targets and shows no sign of activity.   At Rania the Turkish flag is flying.
was compelled to increase the Special Constabulary and to arrest and intern over 300 persons suspected of instigating crime. As a result, conditions began to improve, but serious outrages still continued to be committed.On the 22nd June Field-Marshal Sir Henry Wilson was murdered in London. The news of this murder was well known in County Antrim before the evening of the 23rd June, and its effect upon loyalist feeling can readily be realised. It is quite plain that on that evening the situation in and about the Glens of Antrim was tense and charged with political feeling.Cushendall is a village close to the sea at Limerick Point on the north shore of New Bay. It lies on the main road from Larne to Ballycastle and the Giants Causeway at the foot of the hills close to the Glens of Antrim. The Glen country is wild, hilly, well wooded and sparsely inhabited, and would afford ample opportunity for the concealed concentration of considerable forces. The population of Cushendall and the surrounding country for the most part professes the Roman Catholic faith and is in sympathy with the political views indicated respectively by the terms Nationalism and Sinn Fein. The centre of the village itself is the Curfew Tower, and the little square outside is known as the Diamond, where four roads meet : High Street from the north-west, Shore Street from the north-east, Bridge Street from the south-east and Mill Street from the south-west; the Shore Street-Mill Street road is practically level, but the approach from Bridge Street to the Diamond is slightly uphill, while from the Diamond up High Street is a short, fairly steep hill the crest of which is reached in about 150 yards. On the right of the High Street about 80 yards up is a shrubbery inside a wall coloured with pink from which the Diamond and part of Bridge Street could be covered.At 8 p.m. on the 23rd June, 1922, a party of three officers and twenty-four other ranks of the 2nd Battalion, the Green Howards under the command of Major B. S. Moss-Blundell, D.S.O., O.B.E., left Aldergrove in three Crossley tenders with orders from the Officer Commanding the Battalion to proceed to Ballymena and Cushendall up the Antrim Glen returning via Garron Point to Ballymena. This party was sent out inconsequence of a report that there was a concentration of I.R.A. in the Glens of Antrim. This report had been received by the 18th Infantry Brigade from the police, who informed the military that they believed the source of the information to be fairly reliable. The 18th Infantry Brigade transmitted it to the 15th Infantry Brigade, and the latter communicated it to the 2nd Battalion the Green Howards with orders to investigate in conjunction with the police, and report. Having regard&apos; to the facts set out above and the general situation to which I have referred, it appears to me plain that this operation was properly undertaken.It was not improbable that in the course of the investigation ordered it might become necessary to search houses in one or more of the villages of the Glen for arms, and. it was accordingly desirable that police should accompany the party, since, though under &quot;The Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland), 1922,&quot; power was given to the troops to search premises on suspicion that they were being, had been, or were about to be, used in a manner prejudicial to the preservation of the peace or the maintenance of order, the policy adopted wherever possible had been for the troops to form a cordon outside a house which was to be searched, but for the actual search to be conducted by the police.Major Moss-Blundell, in accordance with his instructions, called at the various police stations on his route. At Ballymena a party of ten Special Police under Sergeant McLean was detailed by Captain Anderson, the Second-in-Command of the 52nd Platoon, to go with the military party in a Crossley tender for the purpose of acting as guides. This tender, therefore, went in front from Blallymena, the military following with Lieut. Hawkins in command of the first military tender, Lieut. Bulfin of the second, and Major Moss-Blundell in the last. Fifty yards&apos; interval was maintained between the tenders. After leaving Ballymena trie party proceeded towards Cushendall without incident until after passing Kilmore, but between Kilmore. and Glenariff a body of men, estimated at twelve, to thirty in number, were observed on the left-hand side on a plateau, on one of the lower hills overlooking the road at a place called Foriff. The police tender was stopped, the constables dismounted and the party on the plateau was.called on to halt; they ran away immediately, scattering among the hedges and ditches, which afforded ample cover behind the plateau. The police opened fire and advanced up to the platea/u and, to the ground behind it, sweeping the adjacent ground with rifle and Lewis-gun fire; they did not, however, make any prisoners or cause any casualties. The military had meantime dismounted and held a lane leading up to the plateau, but apart from the fact that Lieut. Bulfin and his corporal fired a few rounds, they did not corhe into
