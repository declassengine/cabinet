this document, IS IKS PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC , MAJESTY&apos;S&apos;&quot; GQVBRNh&amp;hf.CABINET.H, 31.H.DUS I KG.122,807 55,971 17,222Memorandum by - the Minister of Health, 1,     A year ago the Cabinet decided that the State commitment under the local authorities&apos; housing scheme should be stopped at 176,000 houses and that the subsidy to private builders should be limited to existing commitments,Work under the private builders&apos; scheme in England and Wales is now completed, though certain payments remain to be made for which there Is provision in ray current estimates.    Uiis scheme has resulted in the building of approximately 40,000 houses.On the 1st July the local authorities&apos; scheme in England and Wales stood thus:*.- Completed,Under construction, Not started,176,000Of the 17,222 not started, all but some 2,000 had been allocated to authorities and will follow on as the houses in hand are completed.   It Is estimated that about 153,000 will be finished by 1st December, leaving a total of 23,000 hotises in various stages of construction to be-carried over into the next calendar year. Throughout the last Session of Parliament, I have been under constant pressure to state v;hat the future policy of the Government is to be as regards housing, and I have recently, with the Secretary for Scotland, received a very strong deputation organised by the National Housing Council, which made urgent representations in the same sense.    The local authorities are also very anxious for information and guidance on the subject.    In the circumstances, I am compelled to bring the matter before my colleagues,2.     The 216,000 houses provided or to be provided under the two State schemes above mentioned represent a very substantial-1-r^-rrrrrsrrrr.rnrr.-*7ry,----&quot;T&quot;&quot;-&quot;T&quot; &quot;.....
cont, ribut ion&quot; towar-cLa,-the--short-age- caused-by the cessation of building during the war, but it cannot be contended that the shortage of working clash hcuseo has been wholly relieved.      The statement made by His Majesty in 1919 in a speech to a deputation of local authorities that he was informed that 500,000 additional houses were required i3 commonly quoted, and this figure of 500,000 i3 generally adopted by the advanced housing reformers as a starting point, representing a conservative estimate of the need in 1919, to which must now be added for each succeeding year the average annual number of houses built before the war.This io undoubtedly a very greatly exaggerated estimate of the present effective need.      There is no real basis for the commencing figure of 500,000, which was nc doubt rather a rhetorical expression for a very large number than a considered estimate.     There was in fact before the war a very large margin of empty houses.    The war resulted in a considerable reduction In the rate of increase of the population, and the statistics of the 1921 Census do not disclose a condition as regards overcrowding materially different from that indicated by the Census of 1911.     Nevertheless, it is notorious that there is at the present time a considerable unsatisfied demand for houses of every kind, and most of the large local authorities have long-waiting lists of applicants for working class houses whom they are unable to satisfy.The extent of the real shortage at the present time is almost impossible of estimation; but it may not unfairly be conjectured that somewhere in the neighbourhood of 100,*000 houses would need to be added in the near future to the pool of working class houses in order to start the freedom of movement necessary to relieve the acuteneas of the present situation.
5.      It is almost, certain that with the pressure of the present house shortage public opinion will not tolerate the immediate removal of all rent control, but will compel the continuance of the Rent Restriction Act in some form for at least another year, and that consequently free trade in houses will be deferred until at least June 1924.    The continuance of this restrictive legislation, although It does not apply to new houses, must unfortunately Inhibit in some degree the revival of house building by private enterprise, and must lead to a demand for some supplement to the houses which unaided private enterprise can supply.4.      In announcing the Government policy on housing a yearago,  the Prime Minister used the following words:-&quot;We are now only crying a halt - not to stop buildings.  There will not be a single house the less built.    On the contrary there will be more houses built - because we know that by pulling up now, by liquidating this gigantic obligation vre have got upon us of 176,000 houses,, and  then by meeting the building trade on equal terms, there will be more houses, cheaper ...a. I say this, is simply an effort - and I ii3e the phrase which I used before - not to stop house building, but to put it on a better and more business-like footing&quot;.5.     A further factor in the situation to which weight mustbe attached i3 the unemployment in the building trade.    Hiecomparative figures for the first six months of 1913, 1914 and1922, are as follows:-	1913.	1914.	J.922^January,	8.8	8,6	22.3February,	7.3	6 .3	21.7March,	5.2	4.6	18.2April,	3.8	3.8	16.9May,	3.4	3.5	15.5June,	3.5	3.8	15.1The seasonal tendency towards decrease in spring and summer, has been maintained this year, but nevertheless the percentage is
i2i9ibetween four and five times what it was in 1913 and 1914.The figures for labour employed on Government -housing schemes in trie first six months of 1922 are as follows:-	Skilled .	Unskilled.  .	Total,January,	66,807	49,792	116,599February,	58,529	42/706	101,235hiarch,	54,911	3 9, 923	94.834April,	53,027	39,319	92, 346May,	49,032	37., 645	86,677June,	44,849	33,930    ,	78,779The highest number employed in any month was 79,900skilled, 69,946 unskilled - total 149,854 in July,   1921...I think it necessary to quote the above figures, having regard to the general difficulties which *m are experiencing in dealing with unemployment.   As matters now stand,  the amount of building labour employed on the housing scheme will he reduced to comparatively small figures by the end of this calendar year. But there are now 116,325 unemployed in the building trade..6.     A strong case can be made out against continuing any form of subs id y in aid of house buildings   During the past year the aggregate commitment for houses under the local authorities1 scheme has not been increased, and now contracts have only been made to the limited extent to which it has been practicable to get rid of old commitments and redistribute the houses ,    The building trade and the public generally have come to the conclusion that the policy in the legislation of 1919 which was in effect an unlimited State subsidy for house building is at an end.    This has been one material factor in the enormous drop in prices.    There is cons id er-able activity in the sale of land for building purposes., and there has been a definite beginning of building by private enterprise. In a few cases  (and  the number is likely to increase as prices continue to fall) local authorities are prepared to build without
financial assistance; in one notable case an association of colliery owners have - embarked-Unaided on a large scheme for the housing of miners and other similar schemes are under -cons idera-tioa^there is good ground for apprehension that any new-State aided schemes unless most carefully safeguarded may arrest this development.     Private enterprise will, as it is, hang back on the probability of the continuance of the Rent Restriction Act;      The prospect of continued State subsidy may act as a further deterrent to private enterprise and there will be a tendency for prices to rise.If I saw any real prospect cf any general resumption of the building of true working class houseo by private enter-prise,    I should not consider any prolongation of State assistance or any modification of the present policy.      We have, however, to face the fact that private enterprise did not nearly solve this problem before the war, and will not solve it in the near future.   Private enterprise operates only where it sees a chance of profit.      It is already beginning to provide the lower middle class house and within a short time this class of house may be expected to be built in fair numbers,     But although we are certainly getting much closer to economic conditions;, we are still some distance from the level of price at which working class houses can be produced freely in the ordinary coarse cf trade, and I do not think we shall reach that level for a considerable time.Reviewing all the factors in the situation, the undoubted shortage of working class houses which still exists, the pledges to ex-service men, the probable necessity for some prolongation of the Rent Restriction Act, the improbability of private enterprise making any effective contribution to the supply of real working class houses in the near future, and the terms cf the Prime Minister&apos;s statement last year, I have been reluctantly forced to the conclusion that seme further State assistance is necessary to bridge the transition period before ordinary economic conditions are restored.
2 5 j.I do not consider that the local authorities can be left to deal with the-s Ituat ion unaided..   Some few of them are shewing a tendency to do so, but these do not inclu.de the large centres of population.9,     What I contemplate is a scheme for a definite number of houses to be built within a definite period, say two years.    The number taken should nearly approximate to the provision of working class houses nsde in a normal period of two years before  the war -     I in the present financial circumstances cf the country we cannot [&quot;afford to think about large schemes devkjed make good the shortcomings of severs 1 genera tions, Tne scheme should be justified fjf as a step gap scheme devised to bridge over the period during which 1 we anticipate a return to economic conditions and the elimination of W; scarcity values - the most obvious test of this would be the repeal m of the Rent Restriction Act.    The scheme should be so framed as torgive the local authorities the fullest possible financial incentive to economy and central control should be cut down to the absolute&apos; Iminimum.    The last condition involves amendment of the existingIhousing legislation with its limitation of the liability of  the local IIauthority to the penny rate.The number of houses I have in mind is 80,. 000 to be built in the two calendar years 1923 and 1924.   When this is added to the 23,000 houses carried over into 1923 in various stages of construction there will be a programme of about 100,000 houses in two years, which is about the normal provision of working class houses in a normal period of two years in pre-war days.It is difficult to forecast the covirse of prices, but on thebest estimate which my Department can supply, it would seem that theprobable all-in cost of houses may be :-T rovinc e s. Loud o n.Class.A. 400 475Glass B. 450 525This would mean an annual loss of  7 and  6 on class A, houses inthe Provinces and London respectively and of  6.10 and  4 on Class B.houses.
9 ST OLt t3 h,%I should propose- to-ofTer---contrlbxrti.crr^^ theannual loss on houses built by local authorities under the new arrangements representing in the aggregate an. av-erage--anmxaX-grarrt. of  3 per house.    The contribution in each case would be a fixed sum per house, and local authorit3.es would be left with full responsibility for meeting any loss  (whether anticipated, or not) In excess of this sum.    This would give thera a very considerable financial Interest and would materially facilitate the control of prices.    The offer might, in the first instance, be in respect of houses authorised during a period of one year, and could then be reconsidered in the event of a closer approximation to economic conditions being attained.On the full 80,000 houses the State charge at  3 a house will be  240,000; against this, however, there will, as a result of the fall in the rate of interest, be a reduction in the annual charge in respect of the existing scheme.    It was recently estimated, that the reduction in the rate of interest on money borrowed after the beginning of the present year would result in a saving of  ISO,000 per annum and, If, as seems probable, still lower rates are secured by local authorities for some part of the money still remaining to be borrowed to complete the present scheme,  this saving of  150,000 will be increased;I am particularly anxious, to get off the percentage basis and on to the basis of a fixed sum and a defined liability. A flat rate contribution may not, however, be generally acceptable to local authorities, and it may be necessary to provide for a simple sliding scale which will make some general allowance for local circumstances.Legislation will be necessary to give effect to the proposal, and this, I suggest, might be secured by a simple modification of Clause 14 of the Economy Bill.    The consideration
of this  ill ie deferred until the Autumn Session and I should defer any announcement of this proposal until the Bill is proceeded with, while in-the--meantime informally sounding the large urban authorities as to it and ascertaining their views before the House raeetB.V/hlle I do not propose any new plan of subsidising private enterprise, I think that every effort should be made to induce private builders to take over for building purposes surplus lands acquired by local authorities for housing schemes.1 propose, therefore, to encourage local authorities to offer surplus lands for sale or lease on attractive terms, so long as such terns do net involve subsidy but will decrease the charge failing upon the Ex hequer and secure the erection of further houses.     Where a local authority is ready to take over land and use it for housing purposes on its own responsibility and without charge to the State, I should be prepared to agree.(Sgd.)
