This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s GovernmentSECRET.CP. 4128.THE CABINET.USE OF GAS GRENADES IN IRELAND.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.On 4th July, the Cabinet decided that if, after examination, it appeared that the terms of the Washington Resolution did not forbid the use of lachrymatory and other similar gas, steps might be taken to supply ammunition containing such gas to the Irish Free State Government for use against the rebels.    (Cabinet XXXVII./22/6.)This decision was consequent upon the request of the Colonial Secretary that the Disposal and Liquidation Commission should provide lachrymatory gas grenades to the Provisional Government of Ireland. I understand that the Admiralty despatched these grenades, which were on the charge of the Disposal and Liquidation Commission, by torpedo boat from Holyhead to Dublin on 5th July. In order that they should be in safe hands, General Macready was ordered by the War Office to take charge of the consignment. Owing, however, to the terms of the Washington Treaty, he was informed that the gas grenades were not to be issued to anyone and that neither the Provisional Government officials nor anyone else should be informed of the presence of these grenades in Dublin,,The technical description of the gas grenades in question is shown in the Appendix, and in my opinion their use is ruled out by the Washington Treaty.The Colonial Office have informed me, however, that in the opinion of the Foreign Office, who were consulted semi-officially, the Washington Treaty does not affect in any way the use of the gas grenades which have been sent to Dublin.The Foreign Office point out that the Washington Treaty is not yet in force because it has not been ratified.Though we may not be legally bound because the Washington Treaty has not been ratified, yet we were signatories to the Declaration endorsing the general opinion of the civilised world, which condemns the use in war of poisonous or other gases. There is, therefore, upon us a very strong moral, if not a legal, obligation not to use such gases.The Foreign Office further take the point that the Washington Treaty refers only to the use of poisonous gases in war, and that what has been going on in Dublin is not war; but in my opinion if the use of poison gas is condemned in war, its use is all the more to be condemned in peace between people who are not at war with each other.I am, accordingly, of opinion that we are bound as clearly as we can be not to use such devices as lachrymatory gas grenades.These grenades are at present in Dublin, under the charge of General Macready, and I think that they should be thrown into the sea.L. W.-E.The War Office,2$ih July, 1922.A154
APPENDIX,The only lachrymatory bombs or grenades used during the war by the British A.rmy contained&apos; the liquid ethyl iodoacetate, known under the code name of S.K. or K.S.K. The following is a brief summary of the physiological data regarding this compound :-&quot; The substance is a strong lachrymator and a respiratory irritant. In high concentrations it causes acute hsemorrhagic conjunctivitis of such severity that permanent effects on the eyes, in the shape of corneal opacity, may result. The substance may also cause acute septic inflammation of the whole organ.Inhalation of  large  doses of the compound may lead to death from asphyxia, owing toinflammation  of   the  air passages and   their   obstruction   by  inflammatory   products.Inflammation and oedema of the larynx have been observed, becoming more marked inthe trachea, bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli. It is possible that the vapour of the substance has a toxic effect on the kidneys, since in severe-and fatal cases inflammatory changes in those organs have been observed. The vapours have an irritant action on the skin and cause blistering in sufficient concentration ;.abrasions of the skin, if exposed to the vapours of ethyl iodoacetate, almost invariablybecome septic.&quot;In other words, while ethyl iodoacetate is employed mainly on account of its lachrymatory properties, it becomes lethal in high concentration.. The Washington Resolution prohibits &quot;the use in war, of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and all analogous liquids, materials or devices,&quot; and ethyl iodoacetate must undoubtedly be considered, in. view of the above physiological data, as falling within this category. Its employment in war would, therefore, be a breach of the Washington Resolution.
