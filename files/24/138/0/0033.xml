[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] 171Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1922.SECRET.CP. 4133.CABINET.SPECIAL   EEPORT   ON    UNEMPLOYMENT. No. 71.   WEEK  ENDED  JULY 21, 1922.Please see Chart on page 9 of this issue showing the trend of Unemployment in this and other European Countries since January 1921.Although isolated improvements have been recorded in the engineering industry, employment is still far below normal. In the North-Western Division the textile section of the industry is very brisk. Wages disputes hamper trade, and there is no hope of an extensive improvement until the cost of production is lowered.The iron and steel industry has improved slightly in the Midlands and in Wales, and the prospects are not unfavourable. In the North-Eastern and Scotland Divisions work is intermittent, and there is no marked improvement to record.In the North-Western, Scotland and Wales Divisions the coal-mining industry is very depressed, and prospects of revival are very remote, but in the Midlands and in the North-Eastern Division some slight improvement has been recorded at certain centres.The shipbuilding and ship-repairing industries are very depressed in the South-Western, Scotland and Wales Divisions. In the North-Western Division work is intermittent.There are no signs of improvement in the lace industry in the South-Western Division, but the glove trade is better. In the Midlands depression exists in the levers section, but some improvement is evident in the curtain branch. In the textile and hosiery trades employment is good in the Midlands and in Scotland, where a brighter outlook is anticipated. In the silk industry in the North-Western Division prospects are not bright, the unsettled weather having resulted in the curtailment of orders. There is increased activity and greater confidence in the cotton trade in the North-Western Division. The clothing industry in the South-Eastern Division is experiencing a slackness, particularly in tailoring, which affects both men and women. In the South-Western Division the slackness is not so evident. Some improvement in the boot and shoe industry has been observed at Bristol, but short-time is being worked at Yeovil. In the Midlands the industry is fairly steady in the leading centres, and a slight improvement has been noticed in the number of hours worked.THE SITUATION.[P.T.0.
Unemployment in the building industry in the South-Eastern Division has increased, and in the South-Western and North-Western Divisions trade is stagnant. The cement, brick and tile trades are slack, but trade is brisk in Portland stone. In the transport services some slackness is apparent at Tilbury Docks, but at the Welsh Docks the position remains firm, and trade may be expected to improve.There has been some improvement in the Devon Paper Mills. Depression still exists in the pottery, china and earthenware trades in the Midlands. In Scotland there are no signs of improvement in the fishing industry, while in Wales the slate and tinplate industries may be said to be fair.T. J. MACNAMARA,Ministry of LabourNOTE ON UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION IN GREAT BRITAIN ANDIRELAND ON JULY 21, 1922.1. The Trade Union figure of unemployment for July 1914 was 2-8 per cent.The average for the ten years prior to the war, according to Trade Union unemployment figures, was 4-7 per cent. It was as high as 7-8 per cent, in 1908 and 7-7 per cent, in 1909.During 1919 it ranged between 1-6 per cent, in September and 3-2 per cent, in December, and averaged 2-4 per cent, for the year.During 1920 it ranged between 0-9 per cent, in April and 6 0 per cent, in December, and averaged 2-4 per cent, for the year.The figures for 1921 were: To the end of  January .. February March April May June July August September October   ... November DecemberThe figures for 1922 are : To the end of-January   ...FebruaryMarchAprilMayJunePer cent. 6-9 8-5 100 17-6 22-2 231 16-7 16-3 14-8 15-6 159 16-5Hi-8 16-3 16-3 17-0 16-4 15-note. In some items in the Report the figures given relate to Great Britain and Ireland, in others to Great Britain only. In each instance the scope of the figures shown is clearly stated. Where figures relate to works financed partially by the Government, of to other expenditure from Government funds, they have in all cases been given for the area (Great Britain only, or Great Britain and Ireland together, as the case may be), the expenditure in respect of which is met by theBritish Government.

SUMMARY OF ACTION TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT.[From Autumn 1920 onwards.]Cabinet Unemployment Committee,The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, there was a special discussion at a meeting of the Cabinet, when the Cabinet Unemployment Committee was appointed to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the 8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit, extended the periods of benefit and increased the contributions. As from November 1921 the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision for grants in respect of wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed a special levy to provide for these grants. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, which operates as from the 6th April, 1922, amalgamates the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment Insurance contributions, and extends until June 1923 the special periods during which &apos;&apos; uncovenanted &quot; benefit may be drawn. The authority to borrow money from the Treasury is increased to  30,000,000 for Great Britain.Table showing amount paid out in Unemployment Benefit (including Benefit in respect of Dependants) and the Contributions during the period November 8, 1920, to July 15, 1922.

(B.) Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Report. At least 250,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 97,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits and Trade Facilities Act schemes (see table below).SUMMARY SHOWING THE LABOUR EMPLOYED IN GREAT BRITAIN AT JULY 14, 1922, ON CERTAIN OF THE SCHEMES REFERRED TO ABO YE.Scheme.

But in so far as the data are reasonably representative, and are consistently maintained throughout the period under review, the direction of the curves shown in the chart can be accepted as a guide in an international comparison of the trend): of unemployment during that period.The practical disappearance of unemployment in Germany is to be attributed mainly to the abnormal stimulus given by a greatly depreciated exchange to the export trade of an industrious debtor country. This is not an indication, far less a proof, of real and permanent prosperity, or of a greater ability and success in over-coming the same difficulties as those with which this country is confronted.No figures analogous to &quot;those on which the Chart is based exist for France or Italy. There is, however, far less unemployment^ment in France than in this country. The diminution of male labour supply by war losses, the absorption of labour in reconstruction of the devastated areas, the maintenance of a large standing Army, the close inter-dependence of rural and urban workers, and above all, the small extent to which the prosperity of. the country is determined by the state of foreign markets these have -been the main factors to which France owes her relative Immunity from the effects of the general economic crisis.(&amp;.)
