0 0 his hi it this DQOUliEKT IS THE .JPROPERTY OF HIS BBITABNIO.-MAJESTYS -GOVlSRKLENTyCABINET. ^SECRET, ^GEBliAN PAYMENTS IN RESPECT OF PRE-WAR DEBTS AND COMPENSATION (p. 4147. UNDER THE ECONOMIC CLAUSES OF THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I should like to suggest to the Cabinet the line which as it appears to me should be taken in regard to this matter.I am fully in a.ccord with the instructions, which I understand the Treasury have sent to the British Delegate on the Reparation Commission, that this question is not one to be dealt with by the Commission, but that it Bhould be discussed with our Allies at the forthcoming meeting in London in conjunction with the question of reparation payments. The argument, based on the French Governments pledge of the 11th April, 1920, to be used with M. Polncare in regard to the separate action taken by the French Government in refusing on their own responsibility to agree to any moratorium for debts and compensation payments is discussed in the Foreign Office memorandum of July 29th.    Assuming that the French Government can be induced to modify their attitude, I agree that if a partial moratorium is given to Germany in respect of reparation payments, the same course should be followed in regard to debts and compensation payments, v^hioh fall into two classes!  (l) the payments of two million pounds a month in respect of pre-war debts, and (2) the payment of amounts of compensation awarded to Allied nationals whose property has been damaged in Germany, so far as monies are not available from the liquidation of German property in the Allied countries to meet them.    A considerable proportion of the payments under (l) would come to this country, but we do not expect to call upon Germany for any payments under (2).    The French Government would share in the payments under-1-
(l), and may have large - though at present, indefinite -claims to make under (2).   So far as we are concerned, we oould, I think, agree that the payments to the Allies under (1) in respect of pre-war debts should be reduced, during the period that a substantial reduction is made in reparation payments, from two millions to one million.   With this reduction should go a moratorium for compensation payments under (2).   A complete postponement of debts payments by Germany might result in serious looses to British claimants in respect of claims with which German property in this country is charged, and I should be very reluotant to reduce the monthly debts payment below one million sterlings,. Die total debts balances still remaining to bo paid to the Allies are estimated at some  35,000,000 of which  12,500,000 are due to this country.It should perhaps be pointed out that the Foreign Office memorandum above referred to is Inaoourate in stating in the second paragraph that the Anglo-German Agreement of November, 1921, affected in any way the British share of the monthly payments of two millions in respoct of debts.   The memorandum also omits to point out that the difficulty of the German. Government In meeting the monthly payments in respect of pre-war debts has been accentuated owing to the fact that It has omitted to collect the debts in full from its subjects,(intd.)
