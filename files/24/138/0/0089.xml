the London Theses Committee.   He spoke first of the need for re-organisation in the Party, which was to he, net merely a propagandist body;like ah ordinary socialist party, but the actual instrument of revolutionary changes in society.   For this purpose there.were required a strong directing central executive and the detailed organisation of the work of every member of the party.    He explained the inadequacy of the existing branch in the. Party., whose only basis of cohesion was a territorial one, and showed how a new form of organisation must he set up in which groups of members.concentrated their work each on some particular party function.   The work of the .party, directed&quot; centrally by the executive, would be carried down through the district to the local areas and the working groups for detailed attention,,    At the base there would be the small &quot;area&quot; group covering a small district like a single street or a block of houses;    such a group would have its leader, who ?/ould organise the work of party members for day to day party contact in the area with non-members.    Each member would also belong to a working group for specific duties,, and the groups would he organised either by the Local Party Committee j. the. District Committee or the national Executive according to their type.   For such a re-organisation to work success!&apos;uliy, a large local unit of membership we,s necessary ii*i order thai the necessary sub-division of work might assume a real character.    In applying the scheme to London, therefore, it. was,, necessary to group branches&apos; and the initial step in Far East London covered &quot;the- old brari.ch.es of Bow, Poplar, $.WV Ham, S.W. Ham, E. Hams Barking and Ilf-ord.&quot;A general discussion and questions, followed Butt1^ address.&quot;Ad?ms (2l.WoHam) asked if- the old branches were to be regarded as defunct as from-to-day.&apos;   Cant, replied that the old machinery must he kept intact until the new was in proper operation. &apos; Lutt explained more fully the &apos;.ToreaTT group to which he had referred.    It must not be regarded as replacing the old branchy but as covering a. much smaller area in the immediate vicinity of the members home.&quot;Irving (Croydon) raised the question of groups reporting to the appropriate bodyJ and Butt elaborated the subject, explaining the importance of this feature of the new form of work in order to make the party machine a united whole.&quot;Workman fllford) asked why the Far East London area had been selected for the first application cf the scheme.   Cant replied that the main reasons were that it was an area with clear, and simple lines of crmm^communication and one in which, in the main, one . industry predominated -(transport).&quot;Cant then spoke urging the members to enter the new scheme with every possible intention of making it a success.&quot;Foster,(SoWcHam) spoke in favour of scheme, advocating a spirit of dogged determination, to make it a success.&quot;Crawley (S*-Y,Ham) was anxious to-get the Local Party Committee working. without delay and to wind up the old branches at once.       .  . &quot; ..&quot;The meeting. the^a proceeded to consider the constitution of the Far Bast ItohA&amp;i Area,    It was moved by Sturrock and seconded by Parrlah -G2ast 5&quot;This/
&quot;This meeting decides to &amp;d.opt the recommendation endorsed hy the Sub-Executive Committee and the London Divisional Executive ;of the party that the Party members at present belonging &quot;tc the branches Bow, Poplar, Worth West Ham; South West Horn, Eastia Ham, Barking and Ilford be re-orgonised under the direction of a Local Party Committee in accordance with the principles for the application of the Theses on organisation as worked out by the party Commission.&quot;&quot;Deaoon then spoke on the inclusion of Ilford in the scheme, reading five resolutions&quot;passed by that Branch on the subject, in which the branch, having expressed approve of the principle of re-organisatlon on the lines suggested took the view that Ilford should not be included in the present scheme, but should form the centre of another Local Party area to be called the South Essex Local party Area, so soon as it was found possible to establish this. Bull (Ilford) moved to delete from the resolution the words &quot;Barking and Ilford&quot;, and. sapper ted his proposal on the ground that Ilford was geographically outside the area of the Far East London branch, &quot;Martin (&amp;? the late Barking branch) seconded the amendment mainly on the grounds of the political unity of Iliord and Barking and their separation from the o&quot;Cher arsas.   Foster (S.W.Ham) opposed, particularly as regards Barking, which he regarded as part of the present area,    He pointed out that if the possibility arose of setting up a South Essex Committee later on, there would, be no difficulty in making the necessary transfer of members.&quot;Wiltshire (East Ham) opvossd the amendment.   He said that the distance was not serious, and that Barking, in particular, ought to come into the present scheme.   Smith (Barking) supported the amendment on the grounds of the politioal unity of Ilford and Barking, and the fact that they fringed the agricultural areas in which Party activity was beginning to extend.    Cant spoke of the desirability of setting up a South Essex Committee, but pointed out the necessity, from the point of view of crumbers, of including the branches under discussion, in tbj P.E.L. area.   He reminded the meeting that the new branch meetings would be held only once a month, so that attendance for remote members would not be onerous. Crawley (S.W.Ham) opposed, saying that the inclusion of the branch would be no bar to the extension of work in rural parts nor to ultimate establishment of a South Essex area.   Martin (Barking) spoke again, stressing the value of the work that was being done in the agricultural parts. Tyler&apos;(E. Ham) opposed the spirit of local patriotism which, he considered, lay behind the amendment.    Workman (Ilford) compared the fusion of Ilford with the F.E.L. area to the mixing of oil with water.   He elaborated the different economic situation of Ilford and the rest of the area.    He saw, however, no reason for removing Barking from the area,    CP. Putt opposed the inclusion of Ilford against ^their will but wanted Barking to come in.    Deacon spoke in fawur of leaving ILfL-rd out.&quot;After a considerable debate, the amendment was put ^ and was lost by a big majority.    It was then moved and seconded to    amend the resolution by leaving out the words &quot;and Ilford&quot;.   This was carried.   The resolution, as amended, was then put and oarried.&quot;The nee ting then proosodac! to the nomination of &quot;the new Local Part? Ocisiittoe to consist of seven, members,having/
- 5 -having first aocepted the ;fioljjo^ng^^of the Thoe^s-^mrj^ttee as to officers &quot;That these^lye^elected by the L...cal Party Committee, the secretary and Treasurer to be from their own number, theorganising secretary from the general membership ifdesirable&quot;The following were then nominated for the Party Committee, and after an exhaustive vote, the first seven on the list were elected.&quot;Poster (S.W.Ham): Smith (Poplar); Wilson (East Ham); Pearman (N.W.Ham): Wiltshire (E.Ham); Sturrock (S.W.Ham); Parrish (Bow).   NOT ELECTED:-   Crawley (S,W,Ham); Hopwood (Bow); Mohan (N.W.Ham).&quot;Arnot spoke on the functions of the auditors who were to be elected, explaining that they were to exercise a general supervision over the Committees work, reporting thereon to the aggregate meeting, and not to confine themselves to -financial matters.&quot;There were then nominated for the position of auditors Nellie lansbury (Bow) and Ruderman (N.W,Ham1. No others being nominated, these were declared to be elected.&quot;The ninth item on the agenda, a discussion of Party Policy in connection with the Fourth Congress of the International, was not dealt with, owing to lack of time.    The chaxrman. exnlained that it was inserted in the&apos;agenda&apos;as an example of the type of thing that would be dealt with by the monthly aggregate meeting, ih the new area,&quot; iThe Chief Constable of Liverpool informs me that, oh September 5th, the committee appointed to analyse the Party Commission Report attempted to explain it to a meeting of the Liverpool Central branch of the Communist Party.   A communist present stated that &quot;if members sat there for a week they could not understand or get to the bottom of suoh a complicated report.&quot;   Prom what he could gather the uneducated members, although good rebels, would be left in the lower groups and have little knowledge of what the higher or educated groups were doing, which would result in members leaving and the breaking up of the Communist Party.The report was also considered at a special meeting
of Glasgoc: Central Branch on September 3rd.    During the discussion on the part of the report dealing with education it was agrood that the secretary write to the Scottish organiseg); with a view to setting in motion machinery for the &quot;carrying oa of communist schools&quot;:    the Glasgow Communist Branch is of opinion that the Scottish Labour College should be &quot;stimulated i into action&quot; as soon as possible.About 3,000 copies of the Party Commission Report are being printed.The Chief Constable of Liverpool has sent me the following-; information: -&quot;A special meeting was hold at 52, Byrom Street on tb 2nd inst., when instructions from headquarters regarding the transmission of dispatches by cyclists were read. They were to the effect tnat, commencing as soon as possTo^ a cycle corps would be formed in each town and that when : that was done, all letters be passed on by members of the corps, i.e.; in the case of a message from Liverpool to Manchester the Liverpool dispatch rider would tales it to Warrington and hand it to a comrade there who would pass is on a stage further, and so on, until it was delivered.   All dispatch riders to wear-the Soviet Star and produce membership certificates before being given the dispatch. In the case of a message to headquarters, a telegram is to be sent saying a message is on the road.&quot;From the same source I am informed that, on September 3rd,; at a communist and unemployed meeting held in Islington Square, a resolution was carried to the effect that all members of the Communist Party should attend a meeting held under the auspices of the Liverpool Trades and Labour Council in the Stadium.    The;: object of the meeting was to invoice the aid of Liverpool Trade Unions to assist miners threatened with wage reductions.-  .    . - ;Considerable interruptions were made during the speeches:    a member of the audience asked that a communist be allowed to address the meeting from the platform and threatened that if *5 request were refused, the Communist Party would create such a position as would make it impossible for the meeting to he continued.    J. Cook, an organiser of the national UnemployedWorkers1 Committee Movement, occupied the platform for fiveminutes/
. - 7 - % o i*      minutes and made- a scathing attack on trade u*ion officials. Mr. Stephen Walsh, M.-P.:,&apos; had hardly commenced to speak before several of the audience shouted &quot;What about Black Friday?&quot;. m,       The hall was soon in turmoil and-the chairman closed the meeting but several communists who engaged in making speeches all over the hall, were only induced to leave when the lights were partly switched off by the management.A Women1s Group is being formed in South Wales;.,the nucleus consists of three women, Mrs. Earl, Herbert Terrace, Plymouth; Mrs. Thomas, Barryport and Mrs. Ohappell, Cardiff. - The &quot;instructor&quot; for this group is said to be T. Watkins,On September 6th at the Central Criminal Court the case was heard&apos;of of Lilian Mary Thring and Thomas Redman, who were chargec with&apos; being in possession of parts ,of machine guns   with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property.    After,a lengthy deliberation the Jury returned a verdict of &quot;Hot Guilty&quot;,-COMMUNISTS AND THE TRADE UNION congress the 54th Annual meeting of the Trade Union Congress was held in Southport from September 4th --9th inclusive and was attended by 717 delegates representing a membership of 5,127,308, a decrease of 1,290,602 on the previous year,The chair was taken by R.B.Walker, of the Agricultural Worktrs1 Union.There were nearly seventy resolutions on the agenda, most of which differed but slightly from those passed perennially.as foreshadowed in last week&apos;s report the communists con-, centrated on the proposal to extend the powers of the General Council, &quot;No More War&quot; and Unemployment.The Congress resolution regarding the General Council proposed to amend the standing orders and provided that the Council should be kept informed of all disputes by the affiliated unions, but- that the Council should not intervene so long as there was a prospect of the differences being amicably settled by negotiation.    In the event of a breakdown or of large bodies of work people being involved in a stoppage of work, or oistandard/
standard wages or hours and conditions of work being imperilled,   ^&quot; Ehthe General Council, it was proposed, should take the initiative t;, calling representatives of the unions into consultation and shoulfl use its influence to bring about a just settlement.The scheme further provided that where.the Council intervened and the unions concerned accepted their assistance, and, despite ; their efforts the policy of the enrployers enforced a stoppage of work by strike or lock-out.r the Council should organize all such moral and material support as the circumstances of the dispute justified. Por this purpose the General Council should, if deemed necessary, raise funds by a call upon the affiliated unions pro-portionatcly to membership to meet expenditure in relation to the dispute. Where the difference was between unions, the facts were to be submitted to the Disputes Committee of the Council.Harry Pollitt supported the proposals in the above resolution, not, because, he believed in the members of tho General Counoil, but beaauso the sheer necessities of the present position compelled the change.   Pointing to the General Council Pollitt said:&quot;Those people won&apos;t always be there,   There will be people there one day &apos;.ho will use their power for what we are -here- for, if we are honest:    to build up a constitution that shall dostroy Capitalism.   And you will do that only when the whole of your forces are fighting under one banner.&quot;He urged that the duty of such typical general secretaries as hasspoken there, and who were more readily listened to than suchmilitants as himself should be to stump the country popularisingCentral leadership, so that the General Council should becometransformed into an efficient general staff, bent on the destructionof Gapitalism and the conquest of power.The &quot;previous Question&quot; was moved and carried on a card vote by S,576,000 to 1,205,000.little attention was paid to the communist agitation fregarding &quot;No fctore War&quot;.On September 7th the Congress discussed unemployment when adeputation/
deputation, which included J. Cook5 H.G. Bewbold, Jackson, Campbell, Hughes and Halstead, arrived to put before the delegates the demands of the national Unemployed Workers1 Committee Movement/  halstead acted as spokesman,   A sympathetic hearing was aocordec him and then the Congress passed their own resolution condemning the government&apos;s failure to take effective action against unemployment and the &quot;inhuman treatment&quot; involved in reduction of benefits. The resolution also &quot;called upon the Government to provide schemes of national employment, adequate maintenance;, and to make the cost a national charge instead of throwing the burden upon the local&apos;rates&quot;.    &quot;During the conference a discussion took place on the reason why the British miners had not refused to  send coal to America, during the strike.   Harry Pollitt asked whether Mr. Herbert Smith, the .president of the Miners&apos; Federation bf Great Britain, had not, when in America, given the American Co event ion a pledge..that every effort would be made by the British Trade Unions- to help the American miners in their struggle with the ooal owners and to prevent British coal going tp..America. Pollitt declared that it was the amount of British, coal which had been sent to America that had.undermined the position of the jiwerican miners.After denying.the truth of the last statement * of.Pollitfs, Smith said:    -   \.:&apos; .   &apos; -   1&quot;We have sent  10,000 to these people.    if is&apos; easy for communists to &apos;get on the platform and say what they would do-, but if they would&apos; take responsibility they would understand.    I want to ask Pollitt and this Congress what more we could have done.    Our men were, down and out.    When we sit round a table with..Transport Workers, and Railwaymen to consider this matter we find more difficulty than oommunists&quot;realise in their speeches in the Market Place.    It is true that I told the Americans wewould/
would do what we could, &quot;but would I have been justified in asking our men-, struggling as they are, to prevent men working here for coal which has not in fact affected the American miners?&quot;0Pollitt has reported to headquarters that he is &quot;satisfied with the show our people have put up on theserious items.&quot;The following is an extract from an &quot;Appeal from the Youth-&apos;, which the Young Communist League of Great British state that they have sent to &quot;every Trade Union and every Trades Council, as well as to all parties in this country, and all members of the Communist Party and the Young Communist League as well.&quot;&quot;The Young Coraraunist League makes the followingdemands on behalf of all young workers and urges their endorsement by this Congress and their immediate operation:1,     AdG(.uato Minimum Wage.2.     Abolition of night work and work in dangerous industries for young workers under 18 years of age.3.     Pour week&apos;a animal vacation with full pay. 4.     A six-hour day for all under 16.5.     Abolition of individual apprenticeship indentures.6.     Pree Saturday afternoons and Sundays.7.     Squal Unemployment &quot;doles&quot; for young and old.&quot;We the Young Communist League of Great Britain submit bo the Trades Uuion Congress the. following resolution, hoping that in the interests of the whole working&apos; ilass/it will receive the support of the Congress.,Resolution:     This Congress, having discussed the economic position of&apos;the working youth, has come to the conclusion that the young workers should be organised in tho mass organisations of the working class, namely the Trade Unions, and therefore calls upon the various sections of adult workers represented at this Congress to throw open the doors of the Trado Unions to the young workers, allowing them the full rights and privileges of Trade iUnionists.&quot; &quot;THE/
THE REE LNTERHATIQWAX OF LABOUR UNIONSThe International Propaganda Committee of Miners has written through Krebs to the British Bureau of the Red Inter-national of Labour Unions:&quot;There will be in Germany, an international congress of the Miners1 International /Propaganda Committee on September 25th. ; Therefore, we ask you to immediately communicate, with: the - South , Wales Miners1 Section and have them appoint, or elect.a delegate to this congress.

What can you expect from this congress?     Your hours of toil have been lengjfchened and your wages slashed below a living standard.    Therefore we ask: will it bring more idle tali?     Can we expect a sincere attempt at formulating a program of International Action?&quot;Simultaneous with the convening of the congress . of the International Transport Pederatiofa on October 2nd: the dockers of Great Britain must suffer a reduction of one shilling a day.     And a further reduction has been decided upon for June 1923.     This reduction was accepted by the officials of the International Transport Federation:   Robert Williams, Gosling mind Bevan are signatories to these attacks upon wa-gss.&quot;On August 10th, Ernest Bevan, the pleader of the dockers1 wrote to Frank Hodges of the Miners1 .

The cut in wages is a general one, thus for the present out contribution towards your weekly . wage will be  1 per week instead of  2 as previously...    The most advisable course for you to pur site would be to initiate a mining minority movement (in Sootland ) which could be linked up,to the existing movement in South Wales and assiime a national character.11TEE YOUNG- COlvlMUNIST LEAGUEThe following notice regarding &quot;The international conference of the Children&apos;s Group Leaders&quot; appears in the&quot;International Press Correspondence&quot;:-&quot;The Executive Committee of the Communist Youth International has decided to call an international conference of the children&apos;s group leaders, to take place in Berlin on September 16th to 18th.      The importance of this conference may be seen from the following agenda;&apos; 1.     Report of the Executive Committee. -2. .   The principles of Communist educational work (speaker:    Hoornls).3.      The methods Of the Communist work among the Children (speaker;    Ziegler).4.

(b)   Hostile organisations.5.      The press and agitation    (speaker:    Reussner).&quot;This conference will offer en opportunity for an important exchange of experiences in the work carried on in the various countries, and will prove valuable in the future development of the Communist children&apos;s movement.&quot; &apos;&quot;...The Berlin Bureau wish comrades who have had &quot;experience in the children^ movement&quot; to be sent from England.. Delegates expenses must either be paid individually or by the Young Communist League.C-Redfern, the recently appointed national secretary,has/
has askea the  &quot;Rankpelnis&quot; group at Bellshill for an estimate for printing 5,250 copies of &quot;The Young Communist&quot; as a monthly or weekly periodical.......    Foreign influence is apparent in the recent &quot;Militarism^Commission Report&quot; of the Young Communist League, as will heseen from the following extracts:&quot;It is naturally young workers who are forced and compelled B&apos;ither by an open system of military eonweription or as in this ,country a concealed one of voluntary compulsion through unemployment and consequent starvation to become capitalist mercenaries.    Unemploy-ment is the greatest recruiting agent of the capitalist class,&quot;Therefore the Y.C.L. must strain all energies to combat the jingoe propaganda and the recruiting of White Guards among the young workers.    Wherever, however,&apos; any genuine proletarian element is enrolled in the capitalist Army, there must be our propaganda.    There must we&apos;be.    We are out to win the leadership of the youthful working class.   Any program that leaves the member of the working class in the capitalist Army out of account is foredoomed to failure.&quot;Therefore the T.C.L. absolutely repudiates the individual evasion or the desertion of the Army as a means of combatting        bourgeois militarism.    This only leaves to the tender mercies; of the Bourgeoisie the very element without whom the revolution is an impossibility, and simply strengthens the hand of the bourgeoisie,and their military commanders.      Our action in any particular situation or crisis must be determined by particular circumstances and by them alone..&quot;General guiding lines, however, must be laid down in keeping with our programme and the object of our organisation.       -&apos; -&quot;These are active participation in the struggle of every section of the working class including the -military struggle.&quot;Usia-^e of the soldiers and sailors grievances as a means of assuring their support (we must not only however, advocate petty alleviations or amelioration in military or naval conditions but a clear cut abolition^ of capitalist control and the .introduction in its place of a workers system of army administration).&quot;Commenting on an article on &quot;Floggings in the Navy&quot;,which is said to have appeared in &quot;John Bull&quot;, the Septemberissue of the. &quot;Young Communist&quot; states that the only hope of     ^the    &quot;ill-treatea youngsters of the working class lies in the class to which they belong and will sweep away not only thebrutal forms of punishment employed in the Army and Navy,&apos; but will sweep away the \idiole rotten system which tolerates suchbrutalities/
