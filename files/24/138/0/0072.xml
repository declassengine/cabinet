W.-E.The War Office,30th August, 1922.Southern Ireland.Dublin. The funeral of Arthur Griffith took place in Dublin on Wednesday, 16th August. Large numbers of people visited the City Hall on the two days preceding the ceremony, and paid their respects to the remains of the late President of the Dail. Many thousands lined the streets whilst the funeral cortege was passing, and no note of discord to mar the proceedings has been reported. The population of Dublin would certainly appear to have realized what effect the loss of this steadying influence may have on their political future.It is understood that the new Parliament will be further postponed from 26th August, but possibly for only a short period. The threat of the Labour trade delegates made at the Irish Labour Congress the week before last, to resign if the Dail is again postponed, is unlikely to have much effect, as the consequences of this move will probably be greater in their own eyes than in actual fact. Although some of the militarily active members of the Republican party may be absent when Parliament does meet, the debate on.the Constitution may be a stormy one. The Labour members have given an indication at their congress that they intend to oppose certain articles, and the change from a strict censorship of the Press to an open debate freely reported may have many surprises in store.The almost daily ambushes of parties of Provisional Government officers and men in and round Dublin continue, whilst sniping and outbreaks of rifle and machine-gun fire are of nightly occurrence in the city. Drawing fire from a Provisional Government post or barrack appears to be the great amusement of the Republican sniper. Instead of keeping quiet, and instead of sending out patrols to stalk their opponents and give them a touch of the bayonet, the Provisional Government garrisons waste ammunition for hours by firing wildly into the darkness. Whether in ambush or in night firing the casualties, if any, are usually amongst inoffensive civilians who are either walking in the streets or cowering in their beds. ,Last Saturday evening, 19th August, the Provisional Government authorities publicly announced that they had information that attacks would be made by Republicans that night on certain places in Dublin, and that in consequence they advised the public to remain within doors. Naturally enough no attacks took place, though some firing was heard during the night in the southern part of the town. It is understood that the information was to the effect that attempts would be made on Westland Row Station, Ringsend Gasworks, and the Government Offices in Merrion Street. The Dublin Horse Show, shorn of much of its former success in spite of the efforts of the Press to write it
up, took place last week. A guard of Provisional Government troops was in attendance as it was rumoured that the Republicans would attempt to. set fire to the show-ground buildings. Some such attempt may have been made one night, as considerable firing by the guard was heard.The car belonging to General Collins was ambushed on the afternoon of l^th August, whilst returning from Greystones to Dublin. The driver was wounded, and the car was damaged by rifle fire and bombs. It is understood that Collins was not in the car at the time. This attack was probably intended to avenge the death of Harry Boland, Michael Collins being held personally responsible by Republican propagandists lor the so-called murder of the former Secretary to De Valera.As stated in last week&quot;s report the final evacuation of Dublin Castle had been delayed for two days. On 17th August the defences of the Castle were handed over to the Civic Guard by a detachment of the 2nd Battalion of the King&apos;s Shropshire Light Infantry, under Major Torin, and the tricolour is now flying over the main gate. An account, by Major Torin, of the proceedings is attached. There still remains the depot at Gormanstown, where 400 Royal Irish Constabulary are awaiting disbandment ; it is now expected that this wall be taken over by the Provisional Government authorities on 24th August.A disgraceful incident took place one night la-t week on the Dublin quays. A British officer, in plain clothes, whilst walking past tbe Provisional Government guard at the Four Courts Hotel, at about 11 p.m., was held up by their sentries and roughly handled, in spite of his attempts to explain his identity. He was hit in the face and over the head several times, even by an &quot; officer &quot; of the guard. Most abusive language against the British was also used, and further ill-treatment was only stopped by the arrival of the senior Provisional Government officer of the post. The attention of the Provisional Government has been drawn to this gross and unprovoked attack, and the drastic punishment of the offenders has been demanded.Orders have been received to &apos;the effect that the Royal Hibernian Military School is to be transferred to Shorncliffe within the next few weeks.Outside Dublin.- The predictions of certain individuals, including Major-General Dalton (in command of the Provisional Government forces which landed at Cork, Youghal and Unionhall), that the Republicans would really offer battle to their opponents in West Cork has not been fulfilled. Liam Lynch, or Liam Deasy, whichever may have been in command in the south-west, has not been able to imbue his followers with the real fighting spirit. Any undisciplined force which relies on organized looting and destruction to assist in gaining its object, and thereby incurs the unpopularity of the population, as has been the case, cannot expect to preserve its morale. It would appear that the Republican leaders have realized this state of affairs ; the riff-raff, who joined up for purely selfish motives, have been disbanded, or allowed to slink back to their homes, whilst the more trustworthy and fanatical men are to be formed into small flying columns, of some 35 men each, organized on the lines of 1921, to carry on the guerilla warfare of those days. The converging advance of the Provisional Government -columns has been slow, and the main tactical success has been the occupation of town after town, everywhere received with enthusiasm by the local population. The delays caused by the destruction by the Republicans of roads and railways, have induced the Provisional Government authorities to make use of sea transport and landings at all important harbours on the southern and western coasts. Dalton&apos;s columns, from Cork and Skibbereen, have now met the troops of Daly from Tralee, and Duffy from . Limerick, in the vicinity of Macroom ; the line of the Blackwater was reached early last week. Prout&apos;s column, from Waterford, has still to deal with some Republican bands between Dungarvan and Clonmel in Co. Waterford, whilst the remnants of Liam Lynch&apos;s main forces, with whom are believed to be De Valera and Erskine Childers, have still to be dispersed from the mountains on the border, between Co. Cork and Co. Kerry.Unemployment is still serious in Cork City and the railways leading out of that town have not yet been repaired. Railway communication with the south-west from Dublin has now been restored as far as Mallow, hut the Dublin Cork telegraph service is still interrupted.The Dundalk situation, as reported last week, appears to have been dealt with satisfactorily. The Republican attack was made probably wdth the main object of capturing arms and of releasing their comrades in Dundalk Gaol. It is said that, after the capture of the Provisional Government garrison in the barracks, the Republicans sent an ultimatum to the Provisional Government guard at the gaol stating that no medical assistance would be given to the Provisional Government wounded at the barracks until the gaol was handed over.   This preposterous demand was acceded to.   The remnants of
the Republican force is now being rounded up in the hills between Carlingford Lough and the Armagh border. It is stated that some of these armed rebels are escaping across the border into Northern Ireland. The General Officer Commanding, Ulster District, has been instructed to be on the look-out.There is still considerable Republican activity in Cos. Monaghan and Sligo, and the next effort of the Provisional Government authorities will probably be made in the latter county, where 300-500 armed men are reported to have concentrated.On 10th August, Provisional Government troops, sent by sea from Gal way, landed near Clifden and drove the Republicans from that town. The Marconi wireless telegraph station is again working.Periodical outrages are being reported all over the country. These are all of the usual guerilla warfare type, mixed up with ordinary murder, robbery and the senseless destruction of historical country houses, such as Michelstown and Macroom Castles. Currygrane House, Co. Longford, the property of Sir Henry Wilson&apos;s elder brother, has also been burnt.The new Civic Guard, 300 of whom are now quartered in Dublin Castle, are a fine body of men. They have a smart blue uniform. They are enlisted from the same class as the Royal Irish Constabulary, i.e., the sons of small farmers. At present they are only armed with revolvers for guard duties and other special occasions. Eventually it is intended that they shall be distributed throughout the country towns and districts as an. unarmed police force. Their establishment is to be 4,000, but at the moment they are only 1,000 strong.For some unknown reason the Provisional Government guard at Carlisle Pier, Kingstown, was removed on 18th August ; there is therefore no armed protection for the pier or mail steamers. The look-out sentry on the Royal Marine Hotel tower at Kingstown has also been withdrawn.Northern Ireland.Within the Six Counties there has been no noticeable change in the situation during the past week, but from intercepted correspondence it appears that further developments . are taking place amongst the Irish Republican Army of the North. Some of the men of the northern divisions, known to have been in training at the Curragh and elsewhere, have returned to the North again. At the Curragh, from an address given, it appears that a &quot; 6th Northern Division&quot; has been formed, though with what object and with what territory is not known. Several intercepted letters from various origins give the impression that a revival of activity in the North is expected by the writers. In Belfast, on 13th inst., the police captured &quot; C &quot; Company, 1st Bn. Belfast Brigade, Irish Republican Army, complete whilst assembled on parade. Thirty men were taken. From a document found on the premises, of which copies addressed to &quot; B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; companies were discovered, it would appear that Republicans are gaining a greater control of the Belfast Irish Republican Army than was the case at the end Oi June, when documents showed that only two companies in Belfast were obeying the irregulars.There are decided indications of developments on the borders of Monaghan. On the one hand, the Fermanagh police have received information from various sources showing that concentrations of troops, alleged to be Free Staters, have taken place very recently at Cavan, Belturbet, Ballyconnell, Clones, Kells, Killashandra, and that others are expected at Blacklion and Doura. Hogan, lately promoted from Officer Commanding oth Northern Division to a command in the south, is reported to have returned to Clones on 12th instant. The R.U.S.C. post near Castle-Sanderson, Co. Fermanagh, was attacked in the early hours of the 14th, some 300 shots being fired at it The fire was returned.At the same time, interesting intercepted letters speak of a force of neutral Irish Republican Army collected at Castleshane in Co. Monaghan. This is confirmed by a, brigade report of a body of about 100 &quot;neutrals&quot; at Castleshane House, east of Monaghan. This section of the Irish Republican Army are fed and supplied by th-.&apos; Free State forces, but are equally friendly with the irregulars, and appear to contain, a number of refugees from the Six Counties. The third force operating, namely, the irregulars, have achieved a success at Dimdalk.It is probable that the Free State concentrations reported are intended to deal with the serious situation arising in the Dundalk area, and that Hogan has returned to take -charge of his native area.Conclusions.All  indications   now point to the adoption of guerilla warfare tactics by the Republicans  throughout  the  26 counties.    The methods will be the same as those
carried out against the Crown forces in 1921. The destruction of public buildings, roads, railways and Communications, the ambushing of Provisional Government troops, and the commandeering of money and supplies.But though this policy may cause a great deal of trouble to the Provisional Government authorities, and. much financial loss to the country, the Government will have one great advantage which should eventually lead to.success, and that is the receipt of information from a friendly population. .C. F. N. MACREADY, General,Commaridlng-in-Chief\ Ireland.General Headquarters, Dublin.22nd August, 1922.REPORT   ON  THE  HANDING  OVER   OF  DUBLIN  CASTLE,17th AUGUST, 1922.At 8 a.m., under arrangements made with the Commandant of the Royal Irish Constabulary, the whole of the guards on the Castle, which up to then had been furnished by the Royal Irish Constabulary, were relieved by personnel of the Detachment under my command.On relief, the former, together with their remaining personnel formed up in the vicinity of the headquarters of the Dublin Metropolitan Police and marched to Ship Street Barracks, which adjoin the Castle.A Guard of Honour, under an officer, was mounted in. front of the Old Dublin District Headquarters, and presented arms to the Royal Irish Constabulary, which compliment they returned. The &quot; Last Post&quot; was sounded as they marched away to their Barracks ; this being done as a final compliment to the Force on its disbandment.On arrival at Ship Street Barracks, the Royal Irish Constabulary handed in their arms, equipment, ammunition and clothing and put on mufti.During the morning the men of the Royal Irish Constabulary were employed loading lorries with all the arms, &amp;c, for return to Ordnance. This operation had only just been completed, when the original orders were cancelled and instructions received that the majority of these stores were to be handed over to the Civic Guard. This necessitated the unloading, re-checking and re-loading of the lorries, wdiich was not finally completed till after 11 a.m. I would like to mention that the whole of this work was carried out by the Royal Irish Constabulary in spite of the fact that a large number had already loaded their personal baggage on vehicles ready for departure.The personnel of my detachment was employed returning barrack stores and loading up lorries with these and other stores for evacuation to Royal Barracks. Escorts were also furnished for the lorries containing the arms, &amp;c, of the Royal Irish Constabulary.. The personnel of the detachment not on guard were all concentrated in Upper Castle Yard by 12 noon, at which time they had their dinners.Large crowds assembled outside, and a considerable number inside the main gate (with special permission) at about 11.30 a.m., but the Civic Guard did not arrive till 1.80 p.m.On admittance they formed up and were photographed inside the main gate ; they were unarmed.The men of the Civic Guard detailed for guard duties then marched to Ship Street Barracks to draw revolvers and ammunition, and proceeded to take over my guards. The last guard, that on the main gate, being handed over at about 2.40 p.m. No compliments were paid by the guards of my detachment, to the relieving guards.The men of the British guards, on relief, proceeded to the Upper Castle Yard where they had their dinners. The personnel of the Tank Corps and Royal Army Service-Corps had been sent back to their barracks at 12 noon under escort of one armoured car for their dinners, with instructions to return by 1.30 pan.My detachment finally embussecl at 3.15/ p.m., leaving by the old Dublin District Gate, and returned to Richmond Barracks without incident.The tricolour was hoisted over the main gate as my convoy left the Castle.L.
