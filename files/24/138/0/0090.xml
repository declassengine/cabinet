W.-E.The War. Office,15th September, 1922.,:    Southern Ireland. &apos;&quot; -&apos; .-. (a) Dublin.-The situation in Dublin has, from a military point of view, remained unchanged during the week.The &quot;Dail&quot; assembled on Saturday,. 9th - September,, and selected. Mr. W. T. Cosgrave -as its President, and the various Ministers were appointed. No anti-treaty members attended with the exception of Mr. Lawrence Ginnell. whose behaviour led to his early ejection. The&apos; statements&apos; of Mr.! Cosgrave. and Mr. Richard Mulcahy were satisfactory, and1 Mr. Cosgrave&apos;s enunciation of his policy could hardly have been more concise or definite. -He informed&apos;the Dail that the - lines on which his new government proposed to act were :  -  1 -&quot; It is my intention.to implement this Treaty as sanctioned by the vote of the Dail, and the electorate so &apos; far as it was free to express an opinion; t - enact the Constitution ; to assert the authority and supremacy of Parliament ; to support and assist the National Army in asserting the people&apos;s rights ; to ask Parliament, if necessary, for such powers as may be deemed essential for the purpose of restoring order and repressing crime ; to expedite, as far as lies in the power of the Govern-ment, the return of normal conditions ; and, having established Saorstat on a constitutional basis, to speed up the work of reconstruction and reparation. &quot;*Those words will have given considerable comfort to the more law-abiding section of the community, many of whom, though they are longing for peace, realize that no permanently satisfactory result can ever be achieved while the &apos;&apos; gunman &quot; retains his weapons. ......About noon on 10th September a British despatch rider, with escort in motor side-car, was fired on by 3 civilians, armed with revolvers, at Whitehall, when proceeding to Collinstown. Lance-Corporal G-aughan, 1st Bn. The Cameronians, the escort, was seriously wounded.Ambushes of parties of Provisional Government troops and despatch riders in Dublin and on the outskirts continue.   The type of operations carried out by the Republicans* Since the above was drafted Mr. Cosgrave has made the following satisfactory statement : &quot; There must not be, and will not be, an arined body in the community without the sanction of Parliament (cheers) ; and. Parliament must have control of all arms (renewed cheers); and armed opposition to its will will not be permitted.&quot;(B22/23S)   100   9/22   W.O.P.   325
can be gauged by the &quot; Official report of the activities of the Dublin Brigade, Irish Republican Army,&quot; which is given in Appendix A.The threatened strike of postal employees came into force on Sunday evening, 10th September. The military mail service will, however, not be affected, and it is hoped to be able to maintain a restricted telephone communication between Dublin and Belfast and also between Dublin and London.(b) Outside Dublin. -Reports as to the actual conditions in the outlying districts of Southern Ireland are meagre.An intercepted wireless message (vide Appendix B) from the officer commanding the Provisional Government forces at Waterville (Co. Kerry) discloses a reverse involving the loss of a considerable number of arms, details ot which will probably never find their way into the press.Attacks are also reported to have been made on the Provisional Governments posts at Martyr Castle and Kelleagh (Co. Cork).   The result of these attacks is not known.The Senior Naval Officer at Haulbowline reports that a private fishing ketch, armed with 2 machine guns and 12 rifles, is preying on coasting craft in the area Valentia  Bandcn. Also that H.M.S. &quot; Waterhen &quot; was fired on from the shore on the morning of 10th September while searching a vessel off Dingle Bay (Co. Kerry). Fire was returned : the result is not known.   There were no British casualties.(c) Ulster. The situation has on the whole remained outwardly peaceful, but there are undoubted signs of prejmrations on the part of the Irish Rejrablican Army for a re-commencement of hostilities. In Belfast further disturbances have occurred, but from the casualties it would appear that Protestants have up to the present been the aggressors. Information from one source states that the Catholics do not intend to take any action in the way of reprisals for the present, but are biding their time. This may point to a plan for concerted action both in the city and throughout the counties as soon as the flying columns, which are known to be getting ready, are fully prepared.It is also well known that for economic reasons a number of &quot; B &quot; and &quot; C &quot; Specials are to be disbanded shortly, and it is possible that aggressive action by the Irish Republican Army is not intended to take place until the reduction of the constabulary has been carried out.Along the border the situation has remained normal. In Co. Donegal National troops are reported to have rounded up a complete irregular flying column, and to have captured a quantity of ammunition and documents. The so-called &quot; Neutral &quot; force at Castleshane, on the Monaghan Armagh border, has also been rounded up by National troops, who found arms and ammunition on the premises. A fierce attack, according to press reports, was made on the National garrison of Carrickmacross, Co. Monaghan, early on Tuesday morning, 5th instant, lasting for lj hours. Of the National forces one was killed and two wounded, while one civilian sleeping in a house near by was so seriously hit that he subsequently succumbed.   The irregular casualties are not known.From several sources it is reported that a large number of the forces in Donegal, composed largely of Irish Republican Army trom Counties Tyrone and Derry, are being transferred to the Curragh.G.
