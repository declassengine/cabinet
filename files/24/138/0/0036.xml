Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government)SECRET.Copy no cp.4136CABINET.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The recommendations of the Cabinet Committee on Unemployment, although full Estimates of cost are not given, would, if the precedents of last year were followed, involve the presentation of a further Supplementary Estimate for  1,500,000 (Land Drainage, and Forestry  1,000,000 and scheme of Government Grant of 60$ pf Wages Bill  500,000).Furthermore the Cftmmittee propose that next year&apos;? Estimates should be saddled with (l) a provision of  500,000 for continuing the grant of 60% of ,;wages Bill and (2) an average annual charge of  420,000 for a period of about 16 years.   For the critical year of 1923-24 the charg?.-- will be far greater than  420,000 and will be approximately  750,000. This  750,000 will be In addition to the Exchequer&apos;s existing commitment in respect of Local Authorities Schemes already carried out, for which a provision of about  850,000 will have to be made In the 1923-24 Estimates.Before I deal in more detail with the specific proposals, I feel bound to make the general observation that the task imposed on the Treasury of securing a balance between revenue and expenditure Is rendered virtually impossible if schemes are adoptedinvolving
involving further--heavy-expend!ture unless fresh sources of revenue can also be discovered or other expenditure is greatly curtailed.     The task imposed on the two Economy Committees of/the Cabinet ie that of reducing expenditure next year by sixty millions!As the Cabinet is aware a Supplementary Estimate for  500,000 for Unemployment Relief has been presented. This amount was arrived at after a careful review of the Exchequer&apos;s resources and after consideration of the report of the Inter-departmental Committee on Unemployment Relief.       The report recommended that a sum of  400,000 should be provided and this, after consultation with the Ministry of Health, was increased to  500,000.In this sum of  500,000 there is no provision for fresh schemes of Land Drainage and Afforestation.     Provision for such schemes was deliberately omitted as the Inter-departmental Committee&apos;s Report made no recommendation in favour of suclv schemes.The following considerations should also be kept in mind:-(1)   Although unemployment among agriculturists may be serious, it is spread oveayiaany localities and Poor Law assistance can be afforded without the excessive strain irhich is involved In many urban areas, where unemployment is rife.(2)    An expenditure of  400,000 gave employment to $ of the total number of agricultural labourers.   This seems to impose a burthen on the Exchequer disproportionate to results .(3)    There ie nothing to indicate that agricultural labourers cannot participate in the St. David&apos;s Committee Relief schemes and in the various road schemes.
(4)   Most of the settlers under the Overseas Settlement Act will &quot;be taken from among members of the agricultural community.It is perhaps not fully realised how much is being done this year to mitigate the hardships arising from unemployment and it may be useful to recapitulate some of the measures -(i) Over  3,500,000 has been provided as additional Government contribution to Unemployment Insurance.(ii) The gap periods up to October have been eliminated which will probably involve the borrowing of  2,750,000.(iii) Between  12,000,000 and  15,000,000 will be ex-pended on Roads during 1922-23.(iv) The effect of the Trade Facilities Act will begin to be felt during the ooming autumn and winter and it may well be that employment for over 100,000 men will be found thereby.(v) A Supplementary Estimate for over  650,000 is being taken for Overseas Settlement.(vi) Charges on loans to Local Authorities have cost the Exchequer  520,000.(vii) In the original 1922-23 Estimates,  3,870,000 has been provided in connection with Unemployment Relief Schemes.An important point to be borne in mind is that the rates at which Local Authorities and industry canborrow
i ill !i , -       1,84:--*^borrow are now-markedly lower than a year ago.    It was largely the consideration of the high rate for borrowing which led the Government a year ago to undertake a share of the loan charges in connection with Local Authorities&apos; Relief Schemes.It must of course be recognised that no Government measures of assistance can really affect the Unemployment problem, which can only be solved by a genuine trade revival. The numbers employed under Government aided schemes are but a fraction of the numbers unemployed, and the main justifica-tion for such schemes is the psychological effect which they produce.   Such an effect can be bought 46 too dear a price if the equilibrium of the country&apos;s finances Is upset by excessive burthens being imposed   on the Exchequer.My general view of the situation is therefore that no further Supplementaries for Unemployment Relief should be fh^reduced this year if they can be avoided. Consequently fresh schemes for Land Drainage and Afforestation should not be authorised and the 60% of Wages Bill scheme should not be revived.     On the other hand I agree that we cannot refuse authority for the continuance of Local Authorities1 Schemes, to which the Exchequer contributes a portion of the loan charges, and I would not oppose an increase in the existing capital limit of such schemes from its present amount of  20,000,000 to  25 000,000.     This will give the St.David&apos;3 Committee power to approve fresh schemes of between  6,000,000 and  7,000,000 in value.R *S *H *TREASURY, S.W.31st July, 1922.
