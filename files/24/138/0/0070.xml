Reply from the Swiss , Government..,.JSLAIIOH)BSEM,July 8th, 1922.Sir: -In your- letter of June 7th last, you asked us to inform you what effect the Swiss Government thought it would be able to give to the resolution of the second assembly of the League of flat ions, with regard to the limitation of military, naval and air expenditure, during two sucoesslve financial years.On September 14th, 1921, the Head of the &quot;Swiss Delegation toj the Assembly of the League of Nations had the honour to acquaint you with the reasons whioh prevented the Federal Government from adopting, as the limit of Swiss military expenditure during thej    years 19S2 and 1923, the total of its expenditure in 1921,    Cn this occasion he pointed out among other things, that the 1921 Budget was an abnormal oaor and that, since it was calculated on a quite exceptional basis,  it did not even   allow for the carrying put of certain essential provisions in the owiss Military legislation.This purely temporary state of affairs is being gradually replaced by the only system adapted to Switzerland.&apos;s noimal require-raents,. the system established by the laws whioh regulate her military organisation.    Although prepared in a broad spirit ofI   economy,, the military estimates for 1922 nevertheless enable1I   Switzerland to provide for the most pressing needs of her nationalI   defence.    Consequently, the federal Council, whioh,  in its sincere1I   desire to ooll&amp;borate, as far as passible,  in promoting the League&apos;sideal of peaoe, had welcomed with profound sympathy the spirit which inspired the recommendation of the Geneva assembly, believes thatsame) to undertake not to exceed, during 1923 and 1924, tho totalmilitary expenditure for the financial period 1922,I have the honowr, etc.,(Sgd.)

Our national factories and other industrial concerns have for a long time ceased to be operative.   To-day,, in order to ensure proper sanitary conditions for- ? ...
!for our eoldiersj  suitable accowmbdation satisfying all sanitary jrequirement s has to be provided for. them, and they have to be furnished with the necessary equipment and sufficient foode Most of these needs cannot be supplied by our national ^industries, and everything that is bought abroad is exceedingly dear on account of the rise in foreign bills of exchangeeIt must also be remembered that the value of our natio.ua! currency is continuously falling, so that all supplies of foreign jgoods ahd food-stuffs destined for the army become dearer day by lay ;    In spite of our desire to do so, these facts make it most : difficult for ue to meet the appeal made by the league of Uations,All that the royal Government has been able to do.,   is to &apos; reduce the numerical strength of our army to the minimum j compatible with the defence of our country&apos;s interests^,The Eoyal Government will do iis utmost to comply in the !future with the League of Hations&apos; recommendation,  being entirely I in agreement with the spirit which animated the Assembly when i it passed that recommendation.I have the honour^ etc(&amp;gd. ) M.
