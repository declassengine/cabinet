Allies out of Constantinople and in particular and above all to secure firmly the Gallipoli Peninsula In order to&apos;maintain the freedom of the Straits.     We have received a notification.from the French Government that they are in agreement.with us in informing Mustapha Kemal that he must not violate the neutral zone which protects Constantinople and the Straits and that their,High Commissioner at Constantinopi has been instructed according!yc. .-   The Italians also are.acting in general concert with use     We licpe to secure the military participation of Greece, Roumania and Serbia in the defence of the deep water line between Europe ,and Asia and we are addressing them accordingly.     All the aforesaid Powers are being notified of our intention to make exertions., and that British division is to be placed under orders to reinforce the Allied. Commander-in-Chief, Sir Charles Harington,      The co-operation of the British. Navy will also be forthcoming to the, fullest extent&apos; necessary.,SECRET.
The object of these-axra;a5emexite is -to ^over-trie period which must, elapse before it is possible to secure a stable peace with Turkey.    Proposals are being made to hold a Conference for this purpose probably at Venice, but possibly at paris and the essential&apos;point is that we  should have sufficient strength to maintain.our position round the Straits and in Constantinople, until&apos; this peace has been achieved.      It seems improbable that if a firm front is shown by a large number of Powers acting together, the forces of Mustapha Kemal will attack.     His armies:. which have so far not had any serious re-sis tance to encounter from the. disheartened Greeks, are estimated at between sixty;and seventy thousand men.      But timely precautions are -imperative..     Very grave consequences in India and among other Mohammedan populations for which we are responsible might result from a defeat or a humiliating exodus of the Allies from Constantinople.I should be glad- to know&apos; whether the Government of the wish to associate themselves with our action andwhether .&quot;:they desire to be represented by a contingent.     Hotonly does the freedom of the Straits for which such ir.nen.se sacrifices were made in the vfar involve vital Imperial and world wide interests, but we cannot forget that there are 20,000 British and Anzac graves in the Gallipoli Peninsula and that it would he an abiding source of grief to the Empire if these were to fall into the ruthless hands of the Kemallsts *The announcement of an offer from all or any .of the Dominions to send contingents even of moderate s ise would undoubtedly exercise in itself a most favourable influence on the situation and might conceivably be a potent factor in prevent-ing actual hostilities.-,This telegram has also been sent to - the Governors General

Secret and personali    Begins.The message from the prime Minister which-I trans-mifeted to you on the 15th September is not suitable for textual publication^    There would be no objection to the substance being given to the public as has been done . in Australia, but I send you on behalf of the Prime Minister a further telegram separately in case you want a message the actual text of which can be laid before your parliament.,It was in view of the special associations which they have with Gallipoli that we have communicated with Australia, ana i:&apos;ew Zealand and we felt bound to make the message common to all the Dominionsc    There is no probability of a serious war, but it is essential to prevent the Kemalists from crossing the Straits and entering Constantinople except in accordance with the. decision of a peace Conference which will, among other things,  effectively secure the freedom of the Straits probably under some international arrangement.    The main factor on which we rely    is of course the British Navy and we think it-unlikely that hostilities will occur if the allies continue to act together in for- &apos; bidding the Eemalists to Invade the neutral zone now guarded by allied troops.    However, it is extremely important that Greet Britain, should adopt a firm, attitude,, and anything that your Government can contribute towards the
sense of Empire solidarity would be of the utmost value. At trie juncture a statement to the effect that the Dominion of Canada associates itself with the general position of the Allied power in insisting upon the freedom of the Straits and would be represented by a contingent if the need, arose, would be quite sufficient. That the actual need for despatching the contingent will arise Beems most improbable and in any case it is con-temp la ted that it would be only -of a very moderate size. Australia and Slew Zealand have already replied in a favourable sense.It is a matter of great regret to me that it was not possible to give you longer notice,   out the crisis developed too suddenly.

British reinforcements have been placed under orders to join the Allied Commander-in-Chief at Constantinople Sir Charles Harington and the British Navy will co-operate to the fullest extent.    These arrangements are Intended, to secure the situation pending the meeting of a Conference the aims of which will be to secure a stable peace with Turkey and timely-precautions are imperative.His Majesty&apos;s Government trust that in view of the vital Imperial and world-wide interests involved in the freedom of the Straits for which such immense sacrifices were made by the Empire during the war the -Dominion of Canada will associate themselves with the proposed action and the evidence of united purpose which would be afforded by the- despatch of a contingent should circumstances render it necessary would exercise a most favourable influence upon the situation.

 10.  17 .PARAPHRASE telegram from tho Governor-General of Commonwealth of Australia dated 80th September, received at the Colonial Office 20th September, at 6.27 a.m.Following from my Prime Minister for Prime Minister.    Begins.Your telegram was not received till late in the afternoon on Sunday and after arrival in Australia of pros messages giving substantially same information given to press by yourself.     This in a matter of such grave import anoe Is most unfortunate as it precludes that  full and judicial consideration of the position by Commonwealth which is its clear right as a national Government.     It is not right that a Dominion should be stampeded into action by premature statements in the press disclosing a position which even admitting its gravity is not set out in detail and upon which no information had been previously received by the Commonwealth Government suggesting the probability of the Empire being involved in hostilities.     Foreign Office despatches many weeks old relating to Greco-Turkish position have no doubt been received from time to time. But no information has come to hand suggesting that the Empire was likely to be involved in hostilities and no telegrams have been communicated to us bearing upon recent developments in the Kear Bast.Thus your telegram informing us that the british cabinet had decided to take prompt action against the kemalists came as a bolt from the blue.     And we have notbeen told even now by what action of the Zemalists thisdeoision has been necessitated.     And as it would appearthat the press was notified before your telegram reachedme of the fact that you contemplated hostilities,, ana thatthe Dominions were asked to associate themselves withBrits.in and send contingents, the Commonwealth Governmentfound/- 1 -
found itself in cost embarrassing position of being asked -td decide not between peace and war,  for Britain had already determined that issue without consultation with the Common-wealth, but whether after Britain had decided to go to war and had notified the press that she had asked the Dominions whether they wished to join her, it was possible for us in all the circumstances&apos;, to say that we could not do so.      The point the Commonwealth Government desires to emphasise most strongly is th    ,  that consultation with the Dominions ought to take place before any action is taken or irrecoverable decision is made by Britain, as then and then only can our voices be hoard and our counsels heeded.     Either the Empire is one and indivisible or it is nothing-      If it is only another name for Britain, and the Dominions are to be told that things are done after they have boon done, and that Britain has decided upon war,  and are then to be asked whether they wish to be associated vrith her and to stand by her side,  when they have in fact no other alternative,  then, It is perfectly clear, the relations between the Dominions and Britain being what they are, that all talk about the Dominions having a real share in deciding foreign and imperial policy is empty ail&quot;.I feel that I ought to speak quite frankly and say that tho unity of the Empire is gravely imperilled by such action.. size&apos; Australian people are sick of war.In their view war,  except in defence of vital national interests is not only a blunder hut a crime.     While theyfully recognise the importance cf tho freedom of the starits and would be -grieved and angry If the sanctity of Anzac gravesin Oallipoli were violated,  they havo no. sympathy whateverwith King Constantino&apos;sambitious projects.     They Oo not understand why the-.Dominions were net consulted before Britaintook action,  end before the situation had developed,  and theydo not- understand why the Allies did.not restrain the Greeks2:ong/
Greeks long ago from such a-ction -as - it rnow^-appe^rs^lias-ied^ up tothe present deplorable situation.     That situation is the&quot;nartuxalr^.and indeed inevitable result of the polioy of action or inactionwhich tho Allies have pursued in regard to Greece and Turkey.Australians have seen war raging for many months, great armiesarrayed against one another almost within gunshot of Gewova,  and bring war to an end been doing to they ask themselves what has the League of Nat! ons that was to/bring about peace.     Towards the upkeep of the League Australia has paid and is paying&apos; very large sums of money.     Por a very long time war has been raging at its very doofs.&apos;  It now threatens to spread over the whole world.     What is the League doing? Apparently it is fiddling with unimportant matters while the world is once more in danger of a general conflagration.      Australia, must ask that the League of Nations should actively Interfere in this struggle;    it was established to maintain peace, lot it do so;  if it cannot or will not, let it acknowledge itself help-less and make &quot;way for some more effective means.      In order to make it clear to the world the position of Australia stands In this grave matter, her representatives at Assembly now sitting at Geneva have been requested to urge the League to take immediate action.I hope that I have made it clear that believing in the unity of the Empire as wo do,  and notwithstanding it has not been consulted until the Empire was by the declaration of the British Government committed to action,     Australia will associate itself with Britain   in retaining tho Galiipdll peninsula, and in maintain ing tho freedom of the Straits.     But we think that we are clearly entitled to be told precisely what is the polasy of Britain and her Allies in the Hear East and to have set out in most definite farms just how far Britain desires and intends to go.     And we want to know (corrupt group) what is the policy, of Franco and Itcly and the other powers who are allied with Britain,First as to the policy of Britain,, pr rather of the British Empire,, the Commonwealth Government fully recognise the most important bearing of the situation in the pear East
upon ?, Arabia, Egypt, India and upon the Empire as a whole. This being so what we desire to know is what is the policy of Britain towards Turkey in Europe and in Asia, and what it proposes to do towards affecting a ?. Mention is made of a Conference; well, what is to be done there? What are you prepared to concede? Anything? nothing? The Empire is a world in itself composed of many countries peopled with different races holding widely different religious and other opinions. Is Brittain&apos;s policy satisfactory to the ? in Turkey and throughout the British Empire? If not, is any modification compatible with vital Imperial interest possible and contemplated? We are prepared to back Britain in frustrating the ambitious projects of ?, with which ? have, of course, no sympathy whatever. On the other hand Australia is not prepared to risk one soldier&apos;s life in furthering the schemes of Constantino. Aggression loads to counter-aggression: violence to further violence: and unless the cause for which we fight is just and the military objective is laid down in the most ? and definite way we are not prepared to participate ? in a war. We are not for example to be dragged behind the chariot of French intrigues and ambitions in the Near East. Australia will not be a party to ? Turkey unjustly because it is weak. Are we asked for example to associate ourselves in an enterprise whose object is to maintain the status under the Sevres Treaty? What we want to know is are we to defend the neutral zone, ensure the inviolability of the Gallipoli Peninsula and the freedom of the Straits, but go no ?

further no matter how much France, Greece of the Bulkan States may urge us to take advantage of the superior naval and military strength of the allied forces? Is it the settled and deliberate conviction of the British Government that the provisions of the Treaty of Sevres are fair to Turkey and to the ? world and that no/
further concessions can be or ought to be made?      If not, then to what extent and in what direction ought Treaty tc be modified in Order to meet the legitimate demands cf Turkey? The Commonwealth Government, while expressing no opinion cn the provisions of the Treaty of Sevres relating to Turkey,  ; strongly urges that if it is possible to make any modifications likely to render it more acceptable to Turkey, they ought tc be offered now.before hostilities commence *     Every effort ought to be made to avoid war.      In the unsettled state cf the world, war is like going with, a lighted torch into a powder magazine, The Empire must set; an example to the world.    It must net go to war to gain more territory for Itself or its allies or do anything incompatible, with Its solemn declarations during the Great War and since the Armistice.      It ought not to go to war unless in defence of Its clear rights and unless these are vital to Empire. And the League of Nations must be appealed to and be compelled to shoulder its responsibilities and either prove its worth or confess its futility.     Australia wants also a plain and detailed statement on the policy of Prance in regard to Thracetv. Smyrna and the Near East generally0      To what extent is the Treaty of Sevres or its attitude, or its policy towards Kemal., Gallipoli and the Straits affected or impaired by the Franklin-^ Bouillon Treaty?     Was the Angora Government financed or supported by France against Constantine?     Did Britain or any other of her allies support Constantine in his campaign in Thrace and Angora? What is the general policy of France or Italy?     What troops if any have they agreed or are they likely to supply?The Commonwealth Government hopes this frank expression cf its views will net be misunderstood by the British Government, Frankness on a matter cf such grave importance is Imperatively demanded,      The Empire ought&apos;not to be pushed into a.war.     The Dominions ought not to be asked whether they will associate themselves  with Britain after Britain has in effect committedthem.,/&apos;
them,     And above all they should not be asked to join in an unnecessary or unjust war.      Once the war is begun, no one can say where it will end.     We are a peace-loving democracy., We have been JS:\:.&apos;ojgh a dreadful ordeal in which we hope that you and the world wrli agree we played our part worthily.      In a good cause we are prepared&apos;to venture our all;  in a bad one, not a single man.      In our own defence and in that of the Empire we are quite ready to fight, but we must know where we are go ing c      End.ScGovernor Generals
I Iraq Uuiy)(No.  540).I send you at the request of the Prime Minister for your information though not for publication or textual quotation the following review of the position to date.Begins,    The following is the situation.    The evacuation of Asia Minor by the Greeks is now complete and what remains to be settled is the future of the Straits and the disposition of European Turkey and Constantinople.    The British Government while they are quite prepared to discuss the settlement with every regard for Turkish as well as other interests, consider the following conditions essential to any lasting arrangementn First.    The neutrality of Gallipoli and the freedom of the Straits must be guaranteed for all time.    Second.,    Any modification of the existing Treaties must be brought about not by force of arms but by conference.    Third.    Mustapha Zemal must in the meantime respect the terms of the Armistice concluded with the Allies by Turkey In 1918.    Any breach of the terms of the armistice which at the moment governs our legal position and any invasion of the Neutral Zone will be resisted if necessary by force.    No reply has yet been received to an enquiry addressed to Zeinal as to whether he proposes to respect the Armistice pending a Conference or not.In the meantime we regard it ac most important clearly to show the reality of our determination that the Neutral Zone shall be respected and that the solution shall be reached by Conference. Prom this standpoint two things are specially important. First.    It is necessary immediately to reinforce our Naval, Military and Air forces in the Gallipoli area in order to showthatPi^RAPHKASE TELEGRAM from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governors General of Canada, Commonwealth of Australia, Sew Zealand,  union of South Africa, the Ofiicer A&amp;miniStering the Government of Newfoundland and the High Gommiseioner for Iraq.(Sent 1,45 a.m. 20th September,  192S).   -
that v.&apos;e can stop any sudden breach of the Armistice.    We are doing this with good effect.    cecpndU     We must make it absolutely clear that the position of the&quot;empire if challenged will be maintained firmly against any Turkish forces which can be mobilised against us:    From this point of view &quot;the moral support of the Dominions and the undertaking to send contingents should the necessity arise is of the utmost value not only in impressing the Turks but in keeping our allies sound.    Although there is a general tendency to loss of morale among the Christian lowers in regard to the Eastern Question a quiet demonstration Of firmness on eur part supported by the Dominion Governments should be decisive.    We are confident that any immediate attack can be resisted by the forces which we new have oh the spot with the assistance of the Navy.and the Air Force and the Admiralty has declared its ability to ; prevent the passage of troops from the Asiatic to the European shore whether in the Bosphorus or the Marmora or the Dardadell&apos;&quot;&apos; From the above it Will be seen that there is in our opinion no Immediate need for the organisation of Dominion      , contingents except as a means of showing the solidarity of the Empire In Safeguarding the results bf the War in the Basted theatre,,    At present the French attitude is unsatisfactory but in -spite of their fear of   standing up to the Turks they are unlikely to leave us in sole control - of the Gallipoli Peninsula because it is a standing terror with them that Gallipoli may become another Gibraltar in the Aast of the Mediterranean.    Lord Curzon accompanied by Admiral Beatty has just lefu for Paris to discuss the position with the French Government, and.; we are not by. any means unhopeful of a satisfactory agreement.    In/thi^ respect the attitude of the Balkan nations who were,-all signatories to the Treaty of Sevres   is important since&quot; France has to consider her:, ,; obligations
obligations to them as well as her desire to stand well with the Turks.    The Balkan allies are naturally opposed to the return of the Turk to iiiurope since this would make inevitable another Balkan war in the near future,   Assistance has been promised, by Bouraanla if necessary at once and the Se^b-Oroat-Slovene Government, although it has as yet come to no decision, is not likely to adopt a very different attitude0; We hope therefore&apos; to be able to keep the l,llles\with us in resisting an appeal to foroe and in demanding a solution by Conference.    By bo Dseans are we averse&apos; to the League of Pat ion intervening in the settlement when the time oaaefl, but the first necessity id to ensure that the Turks respect, the nexitral zone just as we insisted on the Greeks &quot;respecting it when they threatened ConstantInople last. ;&amp;*nth, u&amp;&amp; t&amp;ai the Leaoe Conference should aeet in confidence that pending a settlement the Armistice will not be broken.In taking up this- attitude we are putting &quot;forward--&apos;no new claims or fresh obstacles in the way of peace.    We are on the contrary standing by our engagements sad we&apos; are absolutely convinced that muoh trouble will, fce saved In the future with the whole Mahomedan world by a quiet but decisive demonstration that the British. Eiapire is not to &quot;be threatened or bluffed.    To be weak, on the contrary, may.&quot;lead to wide-spread disorder amongst Mahoaedan populations everywhere. There is no question at ^ottr ability to deal with Mustapha Eena3. should this become inevitable as he commands only a force of 60,000 rifles but ou?i- desire is to prevent ^hostilities by an immediate&apos; ehow of flrtsnees, and the effect of the promise of UominIon contingents has already been most valuable from this stand point*&apos;     &apos; ;   - - -      CEIJKCHLLL.&quot;Whitehall Gardens,  S.Vi.1., .20th September, 1922*
