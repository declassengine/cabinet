MS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. JsSCRET.TRAMWAY CHARGING POWERS. ;c,p.4150.Memorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport.In the autumn of .1921,  in order to relieve Tramway, Harbour and Canal Undertakings of the necessity for introducing during the present Session of Parliament Private Bills regulating their charging powers, an undertaking was given with the authority of the Prime Minister that the temporary power to authorise in* creased charges would be extended from February 1923 to 1924. The Cabinet will remember that whereas the Acts which have been passed this session for canals and harbours have the effect of extending the power to authorise increased charges in respect of those undertakings to 1925 and so obviate the necessity for lntro-ducing Bills during the next session of Parliament, the tramway charging powers are to be dealt with in the Expiring   Laws (Continuance) Bill and so will be continued for a further one year only instead of for the two years secured to the other classes of undertakings.If the matter is left where It is tramway undertakings will be under the necessity of introducing Private Bills during next session;    but the circumstances do not afford any sufficient justification for thus differentiating against tramway undertakings. I, therefore, ask the Cabinet to atithorise me if necessary to give an undertaking to the tramway undertakings that their temporary charging powers will be continued to December 31st, 1924, by the Expiring Laws (Continuance) Bill of 1923 unless the question is otherwise dealt with by Parliament.If this extension Is not granted, notices for Private Bills will have to be given in October or November, and prepara-tions will have to be made before that date.     I shall, therefore, be glad to have a decision before the Cabinet rises for the summer holidays.(Signed)    ARTHUR NEAL.August 3rd, 1922. ,I concur in the foregoing,(Signed) Crawford &amp; Balcarres.- - -
