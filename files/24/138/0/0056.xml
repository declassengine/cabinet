SHE COMMUNISTS   -       &quot; &apos;! *&apos; &quot;Ike annual oonference of the Communist Party is to be held in London on October 8th and 9th:   a preliminary notice states that the Executive Committee will assist branches to finance delegates but that efforts should be made locally to provide the necessary money.On July 29th, 30th and 31st the Executive Committeeof the Coraaunist Party debated the question of affiliationto the Labour Party:   the result is embodied in a circularfrom -which the following extracts are taken:-&quot;While we still hold that affiliation to the . Labour Party is our right as a Vona fide working class organisation and that those who oppose us, do so in order to prevent a revolutionary organisation such as ours from having its due influence in directing the Labour Party as a working class organisation against the organised forces of Capitalism we agree   that any further application at the present time would be inadvisable and futile.   But the new amendments to the Labour Party constitution and the knowledge we have that these amendments are to be used to drive the Communist delegate out of the Working Class bodies made it imperative that we should immediately deoide on a course of action to be pursued by our members if and when an effort was made to force them out of any delegate position they may hold,   .&quot;The Exeoutive Committee is unanimously of opinion that our connection with the local organisations should be maintained.   Khis must be taken as a definite instruction by all Party members. IPight in the local Labour Party for the right to sit: fight in the Trades Union branches for the right to act as a delegate.&quot;It will be understood from this that all Party members acting as delegates must accept the Labour Party constitution.   Ail members affected must immediately comply with this.&quot;At the Edinburgh conference arising out of an appeal by the Miners? secretary, a pledge war? given by the Communist Party members who wera delegates that we would support the Labour Party at the coming election.    This pledge which was in confirmation with : the Party policy, was endorsed by the Executive Committee and as an earnest of our decision for a United Working Class 3Pront, it was agreed to withdraw the candidates from Coventry ana Gorton where Labour candidates were also standing.&quot;Comrades:   make no mistake about the united front.   It is of the most urgent moment and the mere fact that the bourgeois leaders of the Labour Party will not work for it does not relieve us of theresponsibility/
responsibility of straining every possibility of securing it.&quot;The decision to withdraw the two candidates referred to in addition to our acceptance of the Labour Tarty constitution will be a powerful weapon in the hands of our delegates on Local Labour Parties and must be used to drive home the lesson to the organised workers, that not we, but the bourgeois leaders, are the disrupters of the Labour movement, v.&quot;We do not appeal for affiliation we demand it as a right and having been refused by those Wbo have oontrol of the Labour Party machine we must, if necessary, face the new situation.&quot;Your Executive Committee have dealt with this situation.;-laner history of this committee meeting isdetailed in a secret document drawn up by Harry Webb:&quot;2he Session of th* Executive Committee over week-end were of urofound value to the Revolutionary capable of learning.   The discussions on the Labour Party and the implications of its amended constitutions were of a very high character. Gallacher, Bell, Mao (MacManus), Brown. Brain, Hodgson were in fine form. Comrade Braddock took up a die-hard position along with Bird of Scotland.&quot;On gunday, in spite of a great contribution by Brown, a vote was taken which registered 6-5 against withdrawal of candidates from Openshaw and Coventry. It was then agreed by the Executive Committee that two from each side with Butt as chairman meet early on Monday and try to come to an agreement.   I was on this Committee, so was Braddock.   The Committee was Brain, Fletcher, Bird and myself with Butt in the oheir.     An agreement was reached.   In this important discussion we asked the following questions and answered them:(1)     &quot;To retain contact with local Labour Parties and Trades Council, or contest Gorton and Coventry? Answer (The former).(2)     &quot;To give our comrades the Initiative by enabling them to declare that we would withdraw our Candidates opposing the organised movement?   (Yes).(3)     &quot;Bid the presence of pollitt and Bookie in the field give the Executive Committee of the Labour Party and the national Executive Committee of Unions the opportunity of saying that we were disrupters of the organised movement? (Yes).(4)     &quot;In the event of advising our Local branches and comrades to get the local unions to fight the local labour parties and trade councils would a majority of such unions affected be persuaded by us or by Henderson and his local followers?   (By Henderson &amp; Co.)(5)     &quot;Would this course enable the Labour Party Leaders to pu$t,, on the,, defensive in a charge of splitting ,thQ,V;Labour Ho^eisent ?   (Yes).
(6)     &quot;In view of Henderson^ statement at Edinburghthat the amendments were not Si^fS^6^^^^1^!11^^-Com^Xst^Irty as such.   Wouia it not be of first importance to make the reactionaries on the LabourParty nlaee a more rigid inte^reiiauxon upon thetwo amendments,    (i; thousand, times Yes). -(7)     &quot;Would this give ue the initiative and place Henderson. McDonald &amp; Co. on the defensive before the whole working class. &quot; (Yes).&quot;In brackets you will find the answer/er as finally agreed to by the whole Executive Committee.     Therefore TuTdul&apos;(T&quot;be a &apos;beTr^/al &apos;6Tiixecutlve .uommiftee responsibility -if any Executive Committee member either s-ooke in opposition or refused to-operate the decision&quot; finally reached..&quot;The second report of the Party commission, which explains the general lines of organisation, was consideredby the Executive Committee at the end of July:   a copy of this document is in iny possession and will be included in a future report..&apos;&apos;  The commission s full report and draft proposals for amendment or adoption by the annual conference are to be circulated shortly:   in this connection the secretary of the Cormaission has asked the Scottish organiser for a memorandum on local Government in Scotland showing, 1.     The main objects of communist work in Local Government;2.     Powers and procedure of the principal of localgoverning bodies and how communists may use them.3.     The dangers in the work of Local Government and how communists should counteract them.The Commission requires this material as its final report will include &quot;short memoranda of practical instruction!. on communist work in different directions.&quot;There are indications that an effort will be made bycommunists in Scotland to secure autonomy in finance and organisation:   the Govan branch appears to he taking the lead In this matter.The &quot;Notes for Speakers&quot; issued by the Communist Party and dated August 5th deal with the Hague Conference and with wages reductions.The following summary of the communist position has been received from an exceptionally well-informed correspondent:
1&quot;All organisations are now passing-through a phase of de-pression and the Coammis-t&apos; Party is no exception to this. &quot; Thi b, however, should not lead us to suppose that, if the re-organisation&apos; of the Communist Party is continued unharrroerec it. will remain static in the future,   ill tendencies point inffj an opposite direction.   From their ambitious plans of re-organisation aided by the undoubtedly severe economic conditif that will in all likelihood prevail, they hope to harness theiL discontent arising therefrom, for their own revolutionary end if&quot;The greatest strength and influence (not necessarily numerically) which is likely to come to the Gommunlst party will be from the organised labour movement.   And it is upon this movement that the Communist p&amp;.rty is concentrating all its efforts.   One of the chief aims in the re-organisation of the Communist Party is to build up within the existing trade   I unions their own nuclei of Communist Party members and sympathisers, and to make possible, by co-ordinated work between the various Communist Party Industrial Groups and strc: centralised direction, to capture as much of the trade union I machinery as possible.    The South Vales Miners1 Federation caiji be taken as a* typical example of the effect of this &apos;boring from within&apos; process, which-the Communist Piiiy members in South Wales have been instructed to concentrate upon.&quot;There are about 350 - 400 communists (members of the Party) in the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, mainly because of the activities of these members, and the sympathy which they have enlisted amongst the non-Communist P^rty members by continual propaganda in the MinersT Lodges, the bouth \&apos;fcles Miners&apos; Federation has twice votea in favour of affiliation to the Bed International of Labour Unions.    It has only been through the strategy of the South Wales Miners&apos; I Federation (most of whom are anti-Rod International of Labour Unions affiliation) Ghat these decisions to affiliate have not yet operated,    axthe forthcoming conference of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation this question will be finally decided.    It is probable that some of the present officials of /the South Wales Miners1 Federation will resign when affiliation to the Red International of Labour Unions is finally carried out by the communists, and their places filled by the latter.  I Plans are now in hand by which the Communist P*:rty members (who are also members of the South, Wales Miners1 Federation)    I may be even better utilised for the   P*.rty&apos;s ends.&quot;Similar attempts of establishing communist nuclei are now in progress in other sections of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, as well as-in all-other&apos; trade unions where they can possibly gain a foothold.   The Communist party is fairly strong inside the Amalgamated Engineering Union.     This is especially the case in London.    The London District Council of the Electrical Trades Union Is fairly well influenced by the Communist Party members on it, and it is communists, who control its official organ in London, *The Electron&apos;.   Bxaet number of members of the Communist party who are in irade unions (with names and addresses and official posts inside the unions) are now being compiled.,.;&quot;The Red International of Labour Unions, although nominally separate from the Communist party, is, however, an organisation set up by the latter body, is completely dominated I by them, with its international headquarters in the same place - Moscow.   Where the Communist ^International can gain no   ) influence they hope to attain the same ends over the workers when they are (through their trade unions) insifie the Red International of Labour Unions.    In effect the Red International of Labour Unions is simply a subsidiary organisation of the Communist International, carrying out the latter&apos;s behests in every way.
&quot;The connection of the Coraraunlst Party with the unemployed movement is very close.   Although in outward appearance the two organisations are distinctly separate, yet the overwhelming majority of the 350 committees comprising the National. Unemployed v/orkers&apos; Committee Movement, are under the control of Communist Party members, whilst the office of the Unemnloyed Organisation in Queen1a Square, W.C.&apos; is being upkept by&quot; the Communist Party and until quite recently their National Secretary and NtiVional organiser (P. Haye and w&quot;. Hannington) had been getting their wages paid by the Communist Party.&quot;The Unemployed, although far from &quot;being at all lively at present, will, I think, revive during the winter and the Communists, being in control of the organisation will of course, strive to direct whatever disoontent there is, into revolutionary ohannels.    The Communist ?i:rty will be prepared to back the Unemployed Organisation financially as soon as there is a sign of a revival on the part of the unemployed.&quot;Now it is obvious that the Communist Pirty cannot possibly meet its financial obligations, and give subsidies to other organisations, solely out of the dues and donations etc. which It receives from its members or sympathisers. And, therefore, like other Communist Parties in other countries who are not on a self-supporting basis, the Communist Party receives financial&quot;aid from the Communist International,  (The Communist International is of course subsidised by the Soviet   Government), for administrative purposes, subsidies for its various publications, including TThe communist, etc.    The amount required from the International is usually submitted by the Communist Party when its delegation is at the annual congress in Moscow.&quot;The Fourth Congress of the Communist International takes place on November 7th, 1922, at Moscow.    The Communist Party has not yet chosen its delegates.&quot;Recently the Executive Committee of the Communist International sent tc England a representative, Borodin, His object is:-1.     &quot;To gain a first hand knowledge of the Communist Party of Great Britain for the guidance of the Executive Committee of the Communist International.(a) Its numerical strength.(b) Its influence in other working class organisations.2.     &quot;To report baok to Moscow the exact financial requirements of the Communist Party,3.     &quot;To advise on, and see that correct tactics are -oursued by the Communist^Party as laid down in the Theses of the Third Congress o:T the Communist International.&quot;During the Miners&quot; Conference recently held in Blackpool, Borodin was instrumental In getting a number of miners&apos; delegates (both officials and rank and filers) to institute a Minority Movement inside the Miners1 Federation, its aim being to rally round it all rebels in the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain and co-ordinate their efforts for the purpose of getting sections and finally the whole Federation to&apos; affiliate to the Red International of Labour Unions.   Nurcerous Lodges, especially in South Wales have already joined the Minority Movement.
&apos;&quot;2he Minority will send a fielegate to the forthcoming World Congress of the Red International of Labour Unions which will be held at about the same time as the Communist Congress, also in Moscow.&quot;Brown is continually travelling about the country At -oreeent ha is somewhere in London.    He has frequent meetings with Communist Party officials either at King Street, 3, Wellington Street (the offices of the Red International of labour Unions) or at the private residence, of J. T. Murphy (an official of the Rod International of Labour Unions.&quot;&apos;Bxe average figures for &quot;The   Communist&quot; during the last 8 weeks were:Printed 24,175Distributed 23,257Returned 5,^-84Cash received    91.10.10.2he debt on the paper has been reduced, during the same period, by  219 and at the end of June was  2,010. 4. 11.THE RED IIVJSJPd&apos;k/f IQHAL OF LABOUR UHIOITS .&quot;She British Bureau of this organisation continues to devote special attention to the coalfields and has arranged to hold a conference of &quot;Mining Uuclei&quot; in the South Wtvlesdivision in the Trades Hall, Cardiff, on August 12th:reports will be made on the work already done and theapplication of the new form of Party organisation to themining industry will be discussed:   consideration will alsobe given to methods of procuring affiliation to.the Red     ;International of labour Unions of lodges end districts aswell as of the South wales Miners&apos; Federation and theMiners&apos; Federation of Great Britain.On August 2nd the T^est Europe an Bureau sent to Hat.Wat kins conies of comrauni oat ions regarding the Britishminers which it had received from Moscow:    ore of these,dated July 7th was from Sudic, secretary of the central committee of the -all Russian Union of Miners to Frank Hodgesand contained the following passages:&quot;Vie have written to you not long ago that the All Russian Union of Miners considers it its duty to enter the International Federation and we have asked to be accepted as a member with full rights.   We considerthat/
that the present moment of the united v/orld attack of Capital against the working class during which the workers are being deprived of their attainments oi the recent years, economic as well as political, imperatively demands the unification of all forces independent of the ideas which the advancec elements of the workers of this or that country may hold.&quot;In view of the fact that the International Congress of Miners will take place in the nearest future, according to our information in august, which may be of great consequences for the general struggle, we insist to be admitted in the ranks of the international     deration. &quot;A second- letter from the same man was addressed to theannual conference of the Miners&apos; federation of GreatBritain at Blackpool and called upon the miners to join the fed International of labour Unions as &quot;the time has arrived that the workers take the power in their own hands, form Labour governments and appropriate for the worker the mines, the factories and the works and do away with exploitation for ever&quot;.A third communication informed Watkins that his presence at the Blackpool Conference was &quot;most urgent&quot; and that he should greet the conference on behalf of the , International Committee for Action and Propaganda of the Revolutionary Miners Union.INTERNATIONAL SYNDICALIST conference the current issue of &quot;The Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; contains a report of the recent international syndicalist conferencein Berlin, at \*/hich various sections of the Fourth International were represented:    the resolutions passed express the opinion that &quot;free communism&quot; can only be obtained by economic organisation of the proletariat, as opposed to the political methods of orthodox Labour Parties, repudiate all Parliamentary action and participation in Government bodies and recognise as the methods of revolutionary syndicalism &quot;the strike, the boycott, sabotage etc.&quot;, as well as &quot;violence as a means of defence against the methods of violence of the ruling classes&quot;.
The conference decided to create an International Bureau, which Is to carry out the decisions of the Berlin conference and to summon a world congress of revolutionary syndicalist organisations for November 12th - 19th, 1922, One resolution declared that the Red International of labour unions &quot;neither from the point of principles nor on the ground of its statutes, represents an International organisation that could combine the revolutionaryproletariat of the whole world into one militant, fighting organisation&apos;1 and expressed the hope that the affiliated unions would participate in the November congress.THE YOUflG OOffiOTIST LB AGUEThe first annual conference of the Young Communist League was held in London on August 5th and 6th and was attended by some 46 delegates from London and provincial branches:     commissions of five accordingly set up and drafted slightly different proposals from the suggested constitution and these were accepted by the conference but will probably be held in abeyance until the annual conference of the Communist Party:    only one copy of these documents is so far in existence but it is hoped that others will be available later. ;It is intended, when the Young Communist League is properly organised, to place some members in the Navy and the Air Force, for propaganda purposes.    Ways and means of entering the Boy Scouts and Girl Guides were discussed as also were schemes1 for obtaining control of the Socialist Sunday School movement.    The Berlin representative of the Young Communist International was present, but made no remarks, neither did he interfere in any way with the proceedings,   -among the delegates were:Joseph/

The defoated and betrayed employed workers and the Unemployed have to all appearances sunk into apathy.   But to those who are of the workers, who know and understand the moods of the English worker, this relaxation is not so much apathy as the sullen mood of a wronged man meditating upon his betrayal and defeat and thirsting for revenge.    The coming winter will indeed be a winter of discontent in England.&quot;Unemployed, headed by George Ebury, are reported to have taken forcible possession of the Plymouth Guardians Board Zoom on August 8th.arrests/
ARRESTSOn August 7th at Clerkenwell Police Court Mrs. Taring, the communist, arid Thomas Redman were charged with &quot;being unlawfully in possession of machine-guns:    they were remandec&quot; for eight days, bail being refused.IRISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES Iff GREAT BRITAINOwing possibly to the holidays there has &quot;been very little happening in Irish Revolutionary circles during the week.    In the London area leading Republicans have been busy with the petition for the reprieve of Dunn and 0&apos;Sullivan,    Copies were prepared in McDonnell&apos;s Office and hawked about for signature bj the leading lights of the Cumann-na-mBan, including Miss Kitty Burrows - Mrs. Sadie&apos;8 friend -.and Mrs. Brady.of Clapham.A short religious service was hold outside Vandsworth Prison on Sunday evening (5th August) and -was attended by 40 or 50 sympathisers who, at its conclusion, sang revolutionary songs.   A similar service was planned for the morning of the execution.     &quot;The Republic of Ireland&quot;, now being printed &apos;by Socialists in Scotland, in its last issue, sayd &quot;Republicans should see that such brave sons of Ireland are not sent to the scaffold without determined - effort being made to save them&quot;.Art 0&apos;Brien&apos;.e. enforced absence from the scene of activiti is embarrassing, his friends, particularly as it allows McDonnell, the Solicitor, to assume a leading role in Irish affairs.    0&apos;Brien&apos;s popularity is diminishing rapidly, many of his former admirers complain of his autocratic pose and say the days.of a &quot;one man&quot; show are gone and cannot be revived.    They prefer to follow the advice of P. J. Kelly whs although a Republican, condemns Art 0&apos;Brien&apos;s tactics as being likely to lead to disaster,   &apos;
In Liverpool the Republican leaders-are reported to be much hampered by want of funds.&quot; Patrick Fleming, who is second in command of the local Irregular Irish Republic .&apos;rmy, denies that the men arrested for the bank robbery at Prestwich are members of that organisation.    The,only place, he says, where it is their policy to rob Panics is in Ireland.    Great Britain still holds full control of Irish money lodged in Irish Banks and by taking such they are striking at the Provisional Government financed by England.In extremist circles it is freely stated that a member of the Provisional Government will be &quot;executed&quot; for the &quot;murder&quot; of Harry Boland.ii pivotal;o State demonstration in Durham, on August 5th, ended in a free fight.     Republicans from the surrounding district organised by J. Flynn of 12, Lawson Street, South Shields, and J. King of 9, Clayton Street, iJewcastle-on-&apos;JPyne, turned up in force and caused considerable disorder.&quot;The Workers.11 Republic&quot;, organ of the Irish communists, is being printed at 10-.., D&amp;wes Road, Fulham, to avoid control by the Free State Censor.Many of the active Republicans in Scotland are on holiday in Ireland, Cissie C.lien, treasurer of the Connolly Club, has been in Dublin for the past month and attended the funeral of Harry Boland on the 4th August.   Hare and there a few Republican clubs are springing up.A new Const j trt5.cn for the Re-publican organisation is said to be under consideration anc. a man named -07DonnelI, who was in charge of the Irregulars at Pettigo, will probably be appointed organiser to replace J:,\ck 0&apos;Sheehan.Robert Mnguire ef Watson Stjeet, Uddingston, is still active and In constant communication with Republicans both in Scotland and Ireland on the question of war material.-   Michael CCcllaghan and  James Luggan are quarrelling over the present attitude of the Sinn Fein officials towards menwho/
who, like himself, risked everything for the cause in the past, and are now thrown over "because they do not see eye to eye with the Standing Committee of Sinn Fein on the question of a Republic or Free State,
