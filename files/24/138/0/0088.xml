3?0H?1AST,QM. OF AN,, Wen?;.Ll^;, air EOROIS&quot;, Mote by the Secretary ox State for Air,1.     The Cabinet approved on &quot;August 2nd the scheme prepared by the Air Ministry providing for an addition of 20 squadrons tp the Royal Air l;force for home defence, The soheme provided that 15 of the new squadrons should be formed on a regular basis and the remaining 5 should he units of an Auxiliary or &quot;&quot;Territorial&quot; Air I-&apos;orce. 2.*      In order to implement the Cabinet&apos;s decision and to proceed with the establishment of the Auxiliary Air ivorce., I am advised that legislation is necessary, A short draft Bill has accordingly been prepared by the Parliamentary Counsel and agreed with the War Office,, A copy of the Bill is appended to this note (Appendix IK 3.      I should explain that statutory authority for the raising and maintaining of an Auxiliary Air Force is already partially provided by Section 6 of the Afir Force (Constitution) Act 1917 which also provides for the application by Order in Oouncil to the Auxiliary Air Force of any enactments relating to the Territorial Army* I was however advised that to rely on these existing powers would be unsatisfactory in two important respects(1)    It would be necessary on legal grounds to set up new local Associations to administer the Auxiliary Air Force instead of utilising, as we desire to do, the machinery already provided by the local Territorial Associations.1-.    These Associations are in fact willing anddesirous
ing the Auxiliary iir    orce, an? the scheme has been drawn up in consultation with them anc  ox course with the Territorial Porce authorities at the &quot;/ar Office&apos;, (s).    Application Toy Order in Council of existing enactments would not enable us to require all officers and men ox the auxiliary Air Porce to accept a liability to be called out for home defence in advance of the mobilisation of the Jirmy Reserve or the embodiment of the Territorial Army.      It is essential that this liability should be imposed in view of the probability that in any future war of magnitude aerial action would be the first form of hostilities and would break out well in advance of any encounters between the naval or land forces,,4.    In other respects the organisation, conditions of service, period of training, rate of allowances, and method of administration will in general follow those of the Territorial Army.      I attach to this note a summary of the scheme (Appendix II).5.      The estimated cost of the Auxiliary Air Lbrce is as follows :-(i) Preliminary expenses 1922-23 (on the assumption that a Skeleton organisation will begin to form on December 1st 1922 with a view to recruiting beginning in April 1923). *    20,000(ii) Initial Cost 1923-4.Initial cost of raising and equipping head-quarters and units including technical equipment on unit charge and motor transport ...........    142,000Upkeep of equipment and transport, petrol,  oil and accommodation,  courses of instruction, periodical flying.desirous 58,000 200,000
(iii ).*   Ultimate Annual .Becurring Cost,. Provision for upkeep of te chnical equipment and transport, petrol, oil, accommodation,-periodical flying, annual camp etc.,  119,000.These figures do not take account of non-effective charges for permanent staff which are estimated at  2,500 annually or of compensation for injuries for members of the Auxiliary Air Sorce, nor do they take account of cost of equipment for annual training.     This equipment will be provide&apos;, from the stocks held by parent regular squadrons to which the auxiliary squadrons will be atta.ched,This expenditure (as well as the cost of mobilisation equipment)&apos; will be met out of the  2,000,000 lately authorised.Sir Ministry.4th September, 1922.

APPENDIX II b SUGARY OP SCFHME FOR AUXILIARY AIR FORCE,1.       It Is intended that the Auxiliary Air Force should assume part of the responsibility for. the aerial defence of the United Kingdom from aerial attack in case of war,      Its specific function In the organisation of this defence would be to be formed into bombing squadrons to assist an aerial counter offensives against enemy forces and establishments in hostile territory.     Such an offensive would he essential to any scheme for the defence of Great Britain against attack from the air.      The work of bombing squadrons calls for less highly specialised training than does the second essential, namely, the attack and destruction of the enemy&apos;s raiding aircraft which would be performed by regular squadrons.A secondary role of the Auxiliary Air Force would be the reinforcement of the Royal Air Force in the field abroad if the necessities of home  defence permit. 2.        It is advisable to restrict the Auxiliary Air Force to small dimensions at its inception and until the efficiency for air work of squadrons raised on an auxiliary &quot;basis has been practically tested.3. It Is therefore proposed to raise five squadrons only in tho first Instance,. Three factors govern the location of these squadrons, namely: -(a) The existence of an engineering population from whom skilled mechanics can be enlistedj(b) The availability of an aerodrome.(c) The propinquity of a regular squadron as parent squadron to the auxiliary squadron..4.       The following have been tentatively selected asfulfilling the above conditions:-(1)
LondonBi rminghamSheffieldLincoln2 square-do-gng^All these fulfil    conditions (a) and (c), but it is not yet certain that they will fulfil    condition (b)ttOther possible localities are Manchester, Bristol and Glasgow; but the two latter do not at present fulfil condition5.     Squadrons are to have a small permanent staff of Royal Air Force personnel and are to hold sxifficient aeroplanes and equipment to enable pilots to obtain flying practice and mechanics to learn to apply their civil trade to the maintenance of aircraft,The Royal Air Force will hold the mobilisation equipment of Auxiliary Air Force Squadrons and the latter will do their annual 15 days   training at a Royal Air Force station under the auspices of their parent squadrona6.      In addition to the five squadrons it is proposed to raise 5 small depot sections to reinforce Royal Air Force Depots on the embodiment of the Auxiliary Air Force,,     These will be located in the vicinity of the -Royal Air Force Depots at which they will carry out their annual training,, 7,     The raising and a&amp;ministration of Auxiliary Air Force squadrons will be entrusted to the County Associations which already exist for administering the Territorial Army,The Air Officer Commanding; Inland Area, Royal Air Force, will, under the Air Ministry, be responsible for the training of Auxiliary Air Force squadrons and will be assisted by a senior Royal Air Force officer with a small staff whose sole work it will he,.So     The approximate strength of the Auxiliary Air Force &quot;&apos;&apos; on the above basis will be 150 officers and 1,300 other ranks.
4 5 59*    Terms of Service, - Of fj oeyg,.In the Initial formation of the Auxiliary Air Force the Commanding Officers of each unit will be appointed by the Air Ministry after consultation with the Territorial Force Association concerned.     The Commander Officer after consultation with the local territorial Force Association will nominate to the Air Ministry gentlemen to fill theremaining vacancies on the establishment of his unit0 Subsequent nominations for commissions will be made to the Air Ministry by the President of the Territorial Force Association, Annual TrainingsThe annual training required will consist of (a) instructional parades (b) periodical flying (not lessthan 12 hours annually)(o) annual camp.     In addition officers will be required to attend certain obligatory courses at Royal Air Force schoolss,     Annual training will take place at .a Royal Air Force station which will provide additionalmachines as necessary.      The officer commanding the stacion will be in general charge of the training. 10, Terms of Service - Other Ranks^The normal period of engagement will bo 4 years0. Men for technical duties trill be required to pass a test before acceptances     Annual training will consist (a) instructional parades (b) annual carap, 11. Permanent Staff of Units,,Each squadron will be provided with (a) a regular Royal Air Force officer as adjutant (b) two non-Gommissioned officer instructors (c) Aircraftsmen on the scale of one fitter and one rigger for every two machines on charge whoseprimary duty till be the mainterance in flying trim of the machines allotted to the squadron for flying training,
A small permanent... -staf f &apos;V5.ill.^als.o- -be-^ro&quot;Vid.ad f or theDepot seotion. &apos;12, Technical Bq-ulpmentEach squadron will be provided (a) for periodical flying with two training&apos; machtn-es and two service machines with spare parts to scale,  (b) with instructional equipment for ground training&apos; (c) with 1 workshop lorry, 1 light tender,  1 trailer. 13. County Assopiations^The responsibilities and duties of County Associations and grants made to them by the Air Council as regards the Auxiliary Air Force will be substantially on the same basis as those in the  case of the Territorial Army,
