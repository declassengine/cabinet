THE COMMUNISTS&apos; &quot;.... It is reliably reported from a foreign source that the moscow Government is now insisting upon a considerable changein the methods of the Comintern.   The main changes are;-nli   The national parties must carry out their work with.their own funds.B,   Offence to other revolutionary organisations should be avoided.3,   The Comintern muat use special agents and funds funds in its efforts to bring about a unity of revolutionary front in &apos;&apos;such a way that nobody shall suspect the Comintfem as the wire-pulling force.4.   The greatest secrecy as to names of agents and all details connected with this work is to be insisted upon and enforced.&quot;1:Informatien has been received tp the effect that onabout July.20th the Third International sent to the Commxua--IsV Party of Great Britain instructions-tions to organise aboycott by all available means of the transport of coal tothe United. States of America.   British communists have en-deavoured, unsuccessfully, to carry eut this order.There are reports fromtwe reliable sources that theOammunist Party *f Great Britain received a considerable financial subsidy in the latter half of July:   one putsthe sum at  10,000 and the other states that Mr.Thomas&quot;libel dan ages were paid rut of this money.An interesting communication regarding the dependence of the Communist Party of Great Britain on Moscow has comeinto my possession:   this document was written by a Scottishcommunist and the &quot;Mr.Brov.*n&quot; mentioned therein is Borodin,who attended a Glasgow communist meeting on August 9th andto whom, reference is made in another part of this report:
- g -&quot;I hadnxt time to wait to hear the particulars of the meeting from Stewart, but I went down St Vincent Street.in company with Tommy Clark and heard enotigh from him to realise what the real purpose of the.meeting . had been: of course,^ 1 am not surprised at anything at all now so much has Wpolitical wangling permeated the -whole organisation,,    It Ts simply a case of money talking.    The Par Vis in the economi grip of Moscow and nobody in the Executive, least of all the paid officials at Headquarters, has sufficient backbone to tell the   Mr.Brown, of.&quot;the Third, that they are not going to obey the dietates of the Comintern, when it means walking over a precipice with oners eyes open.     I also strongly object to these so-called representative meetings at Glasgo^J -whenever it suits the representatives of Moscow to put in an appearance at Glasgow.    Ix the agents of the convention have anything to put before the Party let them face the branches instead of haying these semi-theatrical semi-secrei&quot;gatherings which overpower the average rank and filer presei because of the appearance of a mystery man from the Third. Itrs all a game of getting at the most influential members of the branches for the purpose of talking them over and then getting them to talk the branches over to every new&apos; step taken, &quot;  Brown surely reial&amp;sed that he was in charge off a very ppor case when he told you that during a revolution ary crisis you (they?) would have your head for your in-discdpline.     You ought, to have -told, him that if his case  ff were good, arguments and not threats were the best way of  j proving it and also of converting others,   I wish I hcd beej present to hack you up and am glad although I don&apos;t care    J much for him, that you received some assistance from Leckiejf&apos;..,So far as my own attitude .is concerned, I am not prepared to hand over my thinking faculties to the Third, Fourth;- or,any other International and will leave the Partyrather than do so;   besides it is hot only a question of &apos;-\ the dictation.of Moscow, hut matters.are made worse by the namhy pamby people at Headquarters who have no backbone fo: fighting, and are* prepared tp; r.ecommend that all orders shofg he obeyed provided that they get their money all right. We may make, up our minds that ave will never have an honest and clean Party as long as money from an outside source is spreading its. corrupt!veinfluence.  . In my opinion the tij has now come when we should consider the advisability of breaking off the,connection with London and McManus &amp; Oo.,jj and establishing a separate organisation in Scotland.    I a1! heartily,sick of the-wibple dirty business and am feeling  l&quot;\ like J.S.Clarke that the game is not worth the candle.     iff don&apos;t want to leave the Party with you and the others left to carry on the fight in a growing minority, but the only alternative to that is to try and build up, a separate or-If ganisation in Scotland and to refuse to fall in with Mo self views unless they, agree with our own reason.       ,&quot;...Tommy Clarke told me that there was a possibility of Brown visiting the different districts in Scotland especially where there was strong opposition to Labour Pa&apos; affiliation.     Do you know anything about this?     I belief he is in South Wales at present.     Perhaps there is a strong anti-,Labour Party crowd,&quot;1 PAbani/  I
Abani Hukher;jeef whose communication to Selslatvala re-gar ding the communist funds alleged to have been appropriated &quot;by Mrs.Evelyn Boy, wife of the Indian revolutionary, was quoted in Report Ho. 164, sent on August 17th the following communication to Saklatvala, via Palme Dtftt pnd Whitehead:-&quot;I em in receipt of the reply of my letter to you dated 13th July ia-at.    The affair is not at all surprising to us.   We took it to he something like that.

We here are also anxious to kno?; about her arrest affair in detail.   You as the foremost of the Indian party members I am directed by our group to request you to furnish us written documents all that you know about this affair.     We are in way pleased to learn that your valuable name has been mis-used and in such a ?/ay.   Our nsme also has been misused: specially that of mine and I am deputed by our group to go through the matter and collect all possible material.   Wo have definite proves that they have saved up over $ 100,000 gold since 1915 in the name of Indian revolution,   if you are interested in it I am also in-struoted to furnish you all other documents that I possess.    It has been circulated all over that this  300 has been cheated by the 3n(British) Party and this has   -caused a great disturbances about working with the B.0, P. (British Communist Party).    It has also been ru-moured that in 1920  50 more was given to comrade Maclaino who vr^s then in Moscow for purchasing hooks which money ho pocketed.   You understand by this way how^ they are actually spoiling our work and prospect.   I hope you will take the matter.- seriously and will furnish the wholo affair in writing that steps could be taken,    Be careful of Borodin wo are in trace of a clik who has made their business to get rich at our expenses. i&quot;&apos;or introducing me I beg to inform you that I vta a member of the German party card number 17123 and organ-iser of the Indian Group   party card number l.nThe London Theses Coaaittee appas-rs to be carrying out its programme - in some detail, for at the Eo.ut Ham branchmeeting on August 16th the secretary took particulars ofeach member, as requested in a circular letter:   in additionto the ordinary questions regarding political and industrial activity, members were asked if they could drive a car or a motor oyole and what military knowledge they had.

The preparations to the Congress must take a great time in the work of the British Bureau because it would be very sad if there would be no repre-sentatives on the Congress besides the delegates of our Bureaus,.   Cur comrades- in the British Bureau represent-ing the opposition in the British labour movement de facto, have nevertheless naturally not formally the right to represent the opposition.-   The English workers ercc as you know, great formalists, so the question of the &quot;repre-sentation Is treated by them from the standpoint of * the forms and not from that of facts.&quot;.

appendixSECOND REPORT OE THE PARTY COMMISSION July 89th, 1922. (continued)OCAL organisation the Local Area.What is the local Party area?   Every town or village or administrative district of a town, where our members exist, constitutes a local Party area.     Boundaries follow existing administrative or electoral lines.At the present moment., howevex, the membership of our Party is small and scattered,   On the other hand only a good sized membership can maintain local rooms, keep going the various groups, eleet a capable and responsible Party Committee and hsld good monthly meetings.    OonseqtLsntly, until the Party grows stronger we shall be compelled to make temporary combinations of present branches wherever possible in order to secure sufficient members-.    In the larger towns where our members are mainly concentx-ated, such combinations can be easily affected with general advantage, and the aggregations of membership so obtained should stimulate a more vigorous life and sense of strength in place of the backwater atmosphere-phere of the existing small branches.    In the smaller towns and country or special areas such as mining areas, different arrangements will have to be made;   but even there, much can be done in the way of combination, since the general meeting only happens once a month and should be developed into something of an event, to which members are prepared to come in from a neighbouring locality.. The combi-niag of areas, would, of course, be a temporary measure:    it is not our aim to have larger areas than we can help...The Area Groups.The members in the locality are in the first place all combined in small local groups.    These small local groups which we may for the moment call area groups for convenience (they correspond to the German &quot;Tens&quot; but the figure name is misleading in English) are composed of members living within easy walking distance of one another.-     In localities where&apos; We are strong these area groups may cover a street or a block, in othersa ward but in any case the members must be able to he in easy to-ach with.each other, even though this may mean groups as small as three members in the beginning.Every/
- 2 -Every member belcngs to his area group; this is his immedit unit for small loe^al work and daily contact. House to house propaganda, distribution of the paper, and collection of infoa ation for the area are carried through tho area groups. Sub so tions are collected by the Group&apos; Leader, and forwarded to the Local Party Committeea The area Group Leader has a special responsibility towards the members of his group; he maintains contact with &quot;them and with, the Local Party. Committee, passes on instructions* supplies members whan wanted for some special worJt3 sees that his members are getting tha Party literature paying their subscriptions ana following Party affairs with und standing, gives special attention to new recruits, eto.Other Groups.Besides these area Groups, every member will have some special task,. He may be on the speakers Group, or working in the Local Labour Party Fraction or serving, on the Local Party Committee, or doing some special communication work directly under the Districts In any case he is allotted to some special group, committee, nucleus or fraction according to his qualifie ties and interest&apos;&quot;and this allocation is done by the Local Part Committee workiog under - the &quot;District;. Party -Committee (vvhieb has to sanction all groups, and may at any time revise their conpo tioc. transfer membersIractivities or call&quot;for the creation of special groups).Examples of working groups for general Party work in a locality will be:-- 1) the speakers Group &apos;.-&apos;:.-2) the Instructors1 Group -&apos;3) the Stewards Group-&quot;  4) the Literature Sellers&apos; Group -These groups are not in&quot; charge of en activity;    but meet regu-larly to exchange notes and discuss methods of work.The principal-committees in charge of some&apos; special side o: general Party work in a locality will be:-        v-WV1)     The Propaganda.Committee, consisting&apos;of the group leaders of the -Speakers-&apos; Group,, the Stewards&apos;-&quot; Group and the Literature tellers5-&apos; Group,  together with &amp; member of the Local Party Committee, - and working under the District Propaganda Committee.&quot; This deals with meetings, house to house prfopagandff. lectures, etc2)     The Organising Committee, including the local Organ-! ising Secretary, and Treasurer.   This (which will probably coa-fi slot of three members of the local Party Committee) -deals with finance and subscription, the maintenance&quot;of the register of members and candidates, the management of the local rooms and library (with a special Rooms Committee and Library Committee, if necessary) and hospitality.3) . The Election Work Committee, acting under the Distri Elections Committee and maintaining the necessary Ward Elector Committees.I;i &apos; WM fr M 111
a   S   *4)     The Education Committee, which is responsible for the training of new recruits, and the general organisation of instructions tion groups, Btudy circles and classes for workers outside the Party.     Recruits are brought into a training group as rapidly as possible (five are sufficient to constitute a training group, and adjoining localities may cooperate in this to prevent waiting - fresh training groups ought: to be started every month.) and placed under a suitable instructor; this forms the first special work of the new recruit,The nature of groups, nuolei, fi-actions, etc maybe de-fined as follows:-A Group is a local Party Organisation working uncer the direction of a local Party Committee, District Party Committee, a Special Committee or the Executive Committee.A Nucleus is a Party Organisation working inside an organisation.&apos;fne*&quot; tern caxi bo used for an organisation of all Party members and candidates working inside an organisation,,, or only Of full members directing activities inside the crgani sation,,    (A nucleus is. not. constituted by the mere presence end - activity of (Jon-nnmiKts within- an organisation/   The Communist members within -an organisation must be first definitely enrol To c as a nucleus by the directing authority - the District - they must be report-ed /regularly and receiving instructions;   only then can they call &quot;themselves a nucloi*A Fraction is a Party organisation inside a representative ox Selegate^jody&apos;e    It Is also used fOr a grouping, of all the Gom-munists and their followers inside a trade union or similar organisation)* -All these terms (and &quot;Committee&quot; could be included with them) cover; forms of working Party organisation.    They are units of Party organisation;    they have to bo enrolled by a proper Party authority;    they hold their regular meetings, elect a secretary, have agenda and minutes, report to their directing authority, and-receive instructions.Confereneges Of pxo^^jtej&amp;ejra^ are held regularly under the auspices of &quot;vhe&quot; :&amp;7;aI&quot;&quot;Par% GcmifSee for the .purpose&apos; Of exchanging experiences ^maintaining contact and the- transmission of general instructions.,     These conferences, comprising the responsible workers in the locality, play an important part in the /local life of the Party,      In addition, joint meetings of particular groups are held when their work is closely related or it is de-sired to combine their work in a particular campaign.let us suppose a locality with 100 members.    These will be grouped, let us-say, in ten area groups of 10*   The majority of members will also be in their union branch nucleus and work-shop nucleus^    In addition each member can have his special activity.    These might run: .4 MembersLocal Party Committee             - ;.- 5                        1Assistant to the Local Party Committee &apos; &apos;--(clerical, message etc. ) 2                        IArea group leaders 10Speakers group 9Stewards group 5                        1Literature sellers group 10Instruotors/f

Instead of attempting to. carry through an ; ambitious scheme of re-organ! &apos; - &apos; for the whole division which would make little real differen to the facts of the case the committee has begun by getting work personally over a selected area. The area selected nfai east London&quot; contains at present 6 branches- Poplar, B^w, South-East Ham, North-West Ham, East Ham and- Barking,&apos; The \ step has been to study the area and get into touch with&apos;the more active members of the branches concerned&apos; in order to sei- their understanding and co-operation.     The next step arran ,   is after-sufficient preliminary preparing of the/ground to oi; an aggregate meeting of the members-in the six branches to vii the general, scheme will be explained and who will then const! tuts the new organisation and elect.their-loc-ai party committ! The next step will he gradually to build up the work of the&apos; workers into groups until the working groups will have replacj the old form of organisation. During the period of transitio! the old branches will continue to operate. .This example may prove, of value as illustrating the kind of work which every division will have presently to be doing the ORGANISATION OP THE CSNTHBThe centralisation of a Communist Party throws on the Pa: centre a responsibility wholly unlike that of other parties organisations.    If an analogy were wanted to the. position of .  Communist Party centre, it would have to be found in the orgsl sation which it is created to combat - the capitalist State. I In the face of all the other dissimilarities there are the s basic principles of centralisation and specialisation - of man threads leading up to a departmentalised Executive.The Party Centre consists of (I)   the Executive Committee and secretariat    (II) the Departments with their leading com mittees.
The Executive. .The Executive (kffiimittee is the leading body of the Party. It must contain the ablest directing forces in the Party. It mast be able to meet continuously at the Party Centre.Tho essential qualifications at onoe raise a very roal practical problem.   On the one hand tho Executive must be chosen from the whole membership of the Party on the sole grounf of personal qualifications, and It must be chosen by the high-est body of the Party, the Party Congress, from nominations made to the Party Congress.    On this point the Theses are ex-plicit.On the other hand, the Executive Committee must be able tq meet&apos;continuously at the Party centre and must therefore reside in the immediate neighbourhood of the Party Centre.    This raises two problems.    In the first place, how is it to. be se-&apos; cured that all Exeoutive members should be able to reside at the Party centre?   In the next place, how iB contaot to be maintained with tho country as a whole?On this point the Theses make the following suggestions. There should be a smaller body and a larger body together con-stituting the Central Lead.    The smaller body should be on the spot continuously directing the Party.    The larger body should&apos;. ,; be chosen with a view to securing representation from the dif- &quot;&apos;&quot; ferent parts of the country, and should be summoned by the smaller body for consultation   when important issues arise&quot;&apos;.These proposals would work out as follows:-The Executive Committee, that is to say, the directing body of the Party, consisting of some seven or nine members (the number being determined by the Congress) would need to be on the spot and reside in the neighbourhood of the Party Centre.    The position here wouia be the same as with the Lis-trict Party Committee:    every effort should be made to secure that a suitable person living away from the centi-e should be ablo to live at the Party Centre by flndingr work for him or arranging his work at the Party Centre.     But- if this cannot be arranged, candidates must be chosen who can so reside,&quot; until &apos; the Party is strong enough to be able to make arrangements for any candidate chosen, and that situation has franily tn be faced.On the other hand, the larger body, which we may term the &quot;Party Council&quot; would be elected by the Congress with a view tQ securing widespread representation from the different parts of the country and different tendencies in the Party.   The election might actually take place either as a whole or in part from panels of candidates on a district or divisional basis.    The Party Council would be summoned by the Executive when questions of major importance arise to bo decided.    The actual directing responsibility rests with the Executive.The Party Council could act for the purpose of placing sub-stitute members, when necessary on the Executive : and would also in extraordinary cases, when&quot; extreme technical difficulties pre-vent the holding of a Congress, assume the functions of a Congresr.....   - -..... &apos;&apos; ;C      - To/
To perform its work tho Executive Committee, as has already &quot;Tseim^oocplain-ed In the case of the District Party Committees, di, vides into two bureaux, Orgeoxlsing and Political., Each bureau covers a series of Departments- Each member of tho Executive a has in charge a principal. Department or Departments with a Com! mittee to assist him. . All;&apos;activities of&apos;the Party are&apos; organise! by Departments under the charge of a responsible Executive men., ber and/or a Leading Committee.The two secretaries of the Party, the Political Secretary and the Organising Secretary, act as secretaries to the Politi-cal Bureau, and the Organising Bureau of the Executive- respective, ly, and aro together responsible, for the, preparation of the . agenda and necessary materials for the meetings of the full Exei. executive and also for the work of the various Departments...-The Political Secretary deals in particular With the busi-noss of the Executive Committee j   he signs on behalf of the Executive Coiamitteo.. and he coraauots the Partyxs relations with other Parties and the International,,..&apos; He handles, the material . received from the various political Departments, and ho takes the initiative in bringing forward and working out quontlons of Party Policy.

Ho -receives all correspondence and distributes it- to the differ, ent Departments,:.   He deals with relations with the Districts and other organisations of the Party,,    In addition., he acts as chief of tho Trade Union and V?orkshop Department.Besides- the two regular Party Secretaries, each Department has its .separate organising Secretary .(unpaid) appointed from the commit too in charge..    These organising&apos; secretaries attend Executive meetings in an advisory capacity... when required, and report&apos; weekly (unless- this is done by the E..Cs member) to the Organising or Political Bureau...   .ORGANISATION OP WORK IN TRADE UNIONS AND THE WORKSHOP.The dorirj.natj.7ig importance of our work in the Unions and the workshops5 arid the complicated character of this field of aetivi - makes necessary special consideration of the method or organise-tion....&quot;A very carefully worked out scheme for the centralised organisation of our work in the unions and the workshops.has &quot;bee prepared by a,comrade with considerable experience, and is now under tho consideration of the Executive Committee,    This scheme lays down a system of organisation towards which we need: to woriThe general principles of this scheme may be briefly in&amp;i-l communicated..   An -Industrial Department is established at headquarters^ under the direction of an Industrial Committee.containing the   1 best workers in &quot;the party available for this important -task,,. This Industrial Committee reports direct to the Executive, and must contain at least one Executive member in order to have the necessary authority for its works    The Industrial Committee is divided into sections to cover the different aspects of its worB(1)/ IThis document was written by Ruth Morgan and is in the possession of this Department.
(1) the trade unions; (2) the workshop; (3) trades councils and local labour parties;    (4) pross and publicity.Around this Industrial Committoo are grouped Unions Central Committees for each important union or group of unions.   EachUnion Ooatral Committee is composed of our best members in the union and sitting at the headquarters of the Party of the union. To the Union Central Committee come in the reports of our nuclei in the union in question.    The nuclei in the tranches of a given union in a locality unite to form a Union Local Committee and this; Union Local Committee reports to the Union Central Committee and transmits tho instructions received to the local nuclei.,Committees are advisory bodies:    they prepare policy to be followed in their union; but the be taken by the Industrial Department as a whole or the Exeoutive, and go out from them.     District and national Officials of the Union, and also our members on the District Committees or Executives of the Unions also report to thoir Union Central Committee,The Union Central tho programme and decisions have to for purposes of local co-ordination the nuclei or their representatives in a locality can be combined to form a local Industrial Committee of all unions in an industry in the locality and a Union General Committee at headquarters can combine to form a joint oommittee for their industry.To develop this work we shall need very great care in or-ganising our nuclei in the first place, seeing that they have the proper instructions on how to work, and working out the pro-gramme and line of campaign in each union,     A start is now being made with this work.lATION.The presont available opportunities for members, such as the labour College Economic and Industrial- History classes, do not provide for the needs of the Party,    Our members need to be trained in an understanding of the principles and policy of our Party, in tho history and tactics of the international Communist, struggle and in our own work and method of organisation.    The Labour College classes, even where thoy are not actually hostile or indifferent to the Party, do not provide for these needs. Their-teaching of economics and industrial history lacks the revolutionary political application which finds its realisation in the tk)mcnmist Party,   Wo cannot allow members to bo trained hmder alien influences, and we must be prepared to assume- our lovm responsibilities., *
