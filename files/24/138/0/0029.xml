-f 7[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1922.SECRET.CP. 4129.3CABINET.OVERSEA SETTLEMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary op State for the Colonies.I CIRCULATE for the consideration of my colleagues the attached memorandum, which embodies the observations of the Oversea Settlement Committee upon the recent note of the Minister of Labour (OP. 4062).w. s. c.July 28, 1922.The Oversea Settlement Commitcee recognise that the cessation of migration during the war period and the existing shortage of employment in the United Kingdom create so exceptional a position as to justify any measures tending effectively to its relief. They, therefore, attach the greatest importance to the question raised by the Minister of Labour, and are in favour of any action which will accelerate the new policy of State-aided Empire Settlement.They desire, however, to invite attention to the following considerations: 1. By securing the acceptance by Parliament of the Empire Settlement Act, His Majesty&apos;s Government have fulfilled their obligations under the Resolution of the Conference of Prime Ministers (Cmd. 1474), and are in a position to co-opei&apos;ate effectively with the Dominion Governments in State-aided Empire Settlement.2. Various schemes of financial co-operation under the new Act, e.g., for tbe settlement within three years of 75,000 people in Western Australia and a scheme for assisting the passages of migrants to all parts of Australia, have already been put forward and are at present the subject of negotiation. It is expected that other schemes will materialise at an early date.&apos;3. In these circumstances there is some danger lest the summoning of an immediate conference with Dominion representatives, who could do little without detailed correspondence with their Governments, might lead the various Oversea Governments to delay the negotiations which are at present in progress until the recommendations of the conference were known to them.4. There is also some danger that if the Dominion Governments are approached at the present stage with a pressing appeal for help, some of those Governments may see in the needs of this country a chance of obtaining terms which would favour their own taxpayers at the expense of the taxpayers in this country. Furthermore, political and economic difficulties might arise which would prejudice the even and continuous development of the new policy.5. Generally speaking, the Oversea Settlement Committee regard it as doubtful whether it is possible to accelerate the flow of migration more rapidly than if the schemes above referred to can be set in motion. The Oversea Settlement Committee are convinced that the development of the new policy would be greatly accelerated if a responsible representative of His Majesty&apos;s Government were deputed to visit the Dominions as the Minister of Labour suggests. The passing of the Empire Settlement Act makes such a visit specially opportune. The Committee consider that the negotiations which any representa-tive of His Majesty&apos;s Government would have to undertake with the Dominion Governments in connection with the new Act are so important that they could not, in the opinion of the Oversea Settlement Committee, be carried out satisfactorily except by a member of the Government.July 1922.
