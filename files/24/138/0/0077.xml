(Circulated by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.)(1.)Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissionerfor Iraq.(Personal and Private.) April 6, 1922.Cabinet to-day fully considered Treaty Mandate question and were unanimously of opinion that it would be impossible for us to escape from the Mandate position imposed upon us by League of Nations except by abandoning Mandate altogether and consequently quitting Iraq. I shall telegraph next week a formal statement of our views for communication to Feisal and also a personal message from myself. I. shall be glad to hear from you forthwith whether it is not possible to leave the whole matter in suspense for one, two or three months and carry on as we are doing without either ratified Mandate or a Treaty. Cabinet would be willing to concede point about foreign representation, i:e.. to accept Colonial Office version of Article 5, referred to in your secret and personal telegram of the 19th March, if other matters were satisfactorily adjusted. You had better make no formal communication to Eeisal on this message until you hear further at length from me. This is sent purely for your personal information.Secondly, I am astonished that Eeisal should have dismissed four Ministers without consulting you. Such action was surely not in accordance with the spirit of his personal undertakings about taking your advice in important matters. I should be very sorry if Sassoon Effendi insists on going. You may, if you like, tell him I have telegraphed personally about him. It seems doubly important to temporise over the Treaty, as departure of Naqib would be very bad when so many others are going for different reasons. Please advise me at once whether (a) either a formal communication should not be made by you to Feisal. on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government about his precipitate action, or (5) whether I should not refer to it in personal message I am going to send. Churchill.(2.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(Secret.   Private and Personal.) April 7, 1922.Your private and personal telegram of 6th.As regards the Mandate question, I propose to defer communicating conclusions of Cabinet to Feisal until Kerbala gathering is over. The unfavourable news would only provide agitators with fresh stimulus.The alternative in the last resort to carry on for a few months longer as we are has been envisaged in discussion between Feisal and myself, but not recently, and only with misgiving.There is,first, the consideration that we cannot indefinitely postpone the elections for the Constituent Assembly, and, secondly, the probability that the patience of the British personnel in regard to the settlement of their terms of service would be exhausted, and that a number of resignations would follow announcement of fresh postponement of negotiations. But I would wish to defer my final views on this suggestion until we have seen the result of the Kerbala gathering and matter has been[8804] . b
discussed with Feisal and Naqib; that is, supposing that your present telegram is the last word on the question of the Mandate.I recommend that you also defer your personal communication to Feisal until after the Kerbala meeting for reasons above indicated.As regards the Ministers., Feisal seems now to realise that he was too hasty, and inclined to seek means to make it possible for one or two to return after a short interval if he can do so without loss of dignity. I think your communication to him on that point had better be a personal one, expressing disappointment that he had taken such a disturbing course without consultation with me or his own natural advisers. Message had perhaps better await conclusion of Kerbala episode, so that if necessary both can be dealt with together.My point of view is that it is not the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government nor my personal inclination to destroy his prestige as King and oblige him to abdicate by compelling him to undo hasty or ill-advised acts which he has taken without consultation, but that, if he shows an. undue tendency in that direction, my remedy is to ask to be relieved and to make known the reason.As regards Sassoon, he is coming to see me this evening. I will give him your message and hope we may be able to find a solution which will satisfy him. Cox.(3.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 294.   Secret.) April 15, 1922.My telegram No. 175 of 3rd March (not printed).I had a long personal talk with Feisal yesterday on the situation in general, the occasion being the fortunate outcome of the Kerbala conference, regarding which see my immediately preceding telegram. After discussing the above and observing in conclusion that, at any rate, he hoped that His Majesty&apos;s Government would appreciate the advantage of his having secured a formal resolution of loyalty and support from the Shia hierarchy, he turned to the question of Treaty negotiations, and asked if there was no news yet from London. I replied that I had not yet received an answer to my last communication, owing, no doubt, to your other great pre-occupations at this juncture; but, I continued, from the tenor of a private letter which I received by the last air mail, I very much feared that the chances of His Ma.jesty&apos;s Government being internationally able to abandon the mandatory relation were very remote, and that, in case a final reply should come in an unfavourable sense, it would be well for us to contemplate what our position wrould then be here and what would be our best course of action.Feisal replied promptly that he had intended to tell me at this interview that the situation would not admit of the matter remaining in suspense much longer, and that, if I had not received or did not expect to receive a reply within the next two or three days, he proposed to address me officially, pointing out the difficulty of his position after ten months in Iraq and the danger and impossibility of carrying on much longer on the present indeterminate lines.You are aware of the great risk from a British point of view involved in the postponement of Treaty negotiations, namely, its effect upon the British personnel and upon the Constituent Assembly when it meets. The public are aware that the negotiations have come to a halt over the Mandate question, and I agree with Feisal that delay is dangerous and that the position would deteriorate quickly if the matter were left in the air.The people of Iraq no doubt are mainly inarticulate,, and whether a majority of them at all appreciate the portent of the mandatory relation or actively wish the termination of it I am not prepared to say. But I am certain that the young Iraqis, the newspapers and the articulate elements in the towns are out against it, and I am convinced that Feisal personally cannot now make good under the mandatory relation, and that a Treaty on that basis will not go through on its merits.But what I feel is that our difficulty in this connection are in a great measure questions of terminology and international technicality, and that, as regards the wishes and intentions of the parties concerned, there is not really much divergence. Consequently I earnestly recommend that every possible avenue for solution be explored before a final unfavourable answer is sent to Feisal, which it might be difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Government to recede from.
3-93To this end I respectfully offer the suggestion that Feisal and I should pay a short visit to London by air in the hope of reaching a solution by personal discussion. I do not think the purpose would be served by either of us coming alone. His going alone would be interpreted to mean that he was not coming back. My going alone would suggest that I had been called home to be squared. On the other hand, if we go together and the public are frankly informed that one or two difficulties have arisen in connection with the Treaty negotiations which it is considered could be best adjusted by personal discussion, I am sure we could come without risk of complica-tions, especially after the clearing of the atmosphere resulting from the Kefbala meeting.I beg that this suggestion be deliberately considered before final conclusions are taken. Cox.(4.)Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissionerfor Iraq.(No. 244.) April 20, 1922.We see serious difficulties in you and Feisal leaving the country at the present time. We do not exclude this at a later stage if you are convinced that it offers a real prospect of a solution. Meanwhile, our position must be taken as fully defined by our previous communications. We thought we were meeting Feisal&apos;s wish in placing our relations with Iraq upon a Treaty basis. But if the King does not like the form which the Treaty has now reached after these long negotiations, it is out of our power to depart from the attitude adopted, and the Treaty must remain in suspense.We should be very glad to receive from him in the course of the next few weeks any counter-suggestions which he may care to make, and you are fully entitled to aid him in any way. It is no use repeating the same arguments over and over again We have taken up the only position possible to us, having regard to international obligations by which we are bound.I am quite ready to send him a direct message from the Cabinet explaining the situation. I send you a draft of the sort of thing that may finally have to be said, on which you should let me have jout observations at leisure. But, for the present, I think it better to temporise. Please inform me what course you think events will follow in the next few months if Treaty deadlock is prolonged, and what inconveniences are we to face. I am sure that if trouble arises in Iraq involving the prospect of additional expense, the Cabinet will order immediate and complete evacuation. Feisal should be under no delusions in this matter. He will be a long time looking for a third throne.Draft follows (begins) : The British Government have no power to abrogate or terminate the Mandate for Iraq which they hold from the League of Nations, except by resigning once and for all their special position in the country. The other Great Powers on the Council of the League of Nations would not agree to Britain having a special position in Iraq unless controlled by the Mandate. America, though not a member of the League, would also refuse consent. There is no possibility, therefore, of Britain freeing herself from the Mandate otherwise than by washing her hands altogether oi responsibilities towards Iraq.The meaning of the Mandate and its whole purpose was to restrain Britain and not to restrain Iraq. The Mandate regulates and restricts the action of the mandatory Power, and is intended solely to safeguard the interests of Iraq. The other great Powers would never allow Britain to have special treaty relations with Iraq while escaping from the Mandate. If we were to ask the League of Nations to release us from the Mandate, they would refuse; and the only course open to us would be either to bow to their decision or to quit the country altogether.Of course, when Iraq becomes strong enough in our opinion to stand alone, we shall be in a position to state that our task has been fulfilled, and that Iraq is in fact as well as in status an independent sovereign State. But this cannot be said with any respect for truth and fact while we are forced year after year to spend very large sums of money on helping the Iraq Government &quot;to defend itself and to maintain order.[8804]
We therefore are unable at the present time to alter the position which has been reached in the negotiations for the Treaty. If there is to be a Treaty it must be on this basis and no other. If the King or his Cabinet or the Assembly cannot agree to a Treaty on this basis, then it will be impossible to frame a form of agreement regulating the relations of Britain and Iraq. These are facts which do not depend upon the wish of the British Government, but on powers and laws to which they must bow.The King will therefore see that if the Treaty, which was his idea and not ours, cannot be agreed, there is nothing for us but to go forward on the present indeterminate basis until Iraq is strong enough to stand alone. There really is no use searching for vain formulas which disguise the fact that Britain has to obey the League of Nations, and that Iraq must accept our guidance whilst it requires our aid.The question which the King should now address himself to is the following : Does he desire us to quit Iraq forthwith? We have installed him and his Govern-ment in power, and the country is at present in an orderly state. We could begin the evacuation immediately after the hot weather, and all British troops and civilians could be out of the country before the end of the Christian year. If this is the King&apos;s wish, he should say so, with the knowledge that the responsibility for what follows will rest upon him. I will then bring his wish to the notice of the Cabinet, who alone can take the final decision. The British nation would rejoice to be relieved from a burdensome charge devoid of the slightest advantage to them, but which they have carried thus far from a sense of duty to the people of Iraq, whose Turkish Government they overturned in the war, and out of loyalty to the King, who they believed wished to continue for himself and the Shereefian family the friendly relationships established in the Great War. Churchill.  Ends.(5.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 312.  Secret.) April 22, 1922.Your telegram No. 244, received 21st April.As regards proposed message to Feisal. The position of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment internationally being what you describe, the sooner we clear the air by stating it authoritatively the better for all parties. The text of your message as a whole seems to meet the case, but I would advocate allusion to the alternative of retirement to Basra as well as to that of complete evacuation. Closer scrutiny of draft may suggest observations in regard to some other detail; meanwhile, please consider following suggestions, and, if j)possible, let me know immediately whether the course proposed is prima facie feasible.My telegram No. 299 of 18th April suggesting a possible interpolation in the Treaty, and my telegram No. 302 regarding effect of Kerbela episode, probably 1&apos;reached you after despatch of your telegram under reply.FeisaFs undoubted personal association, if not his direct initiative in encouraging Ulema to interfere in matters which concern the Government, and the evident disposition of himself and his extremist adherents to exaggerate the Akhwan incident and use it for their own ends, is now evoking much unfavourable comment among the best people, especially among the tribal Sheikhs; and a considerable body of the latter have spontaneously gathered in Baghdad with the intention of presenting a written memorial or of going in a body to Feisal to remonstrate at recent happenings, and to remind him of the condition of their oath of allegiance. FeisaFs stock is consequently somewhat low at this juncture, and the moment is a psychological one for an announcement from His Majesty&apos;s Government. It would, however, have very much greater value and effect if it could be made in a form which can be given prompt publicity throughout Iraq, instead of being communicated to Feisal personally. Could it not be arranged that someone should ask a question in the House of Commons saying that he understood that there was a hitch in the Treaty negotiations with Iraq over the question of the duration or continuance of the mandatory relation, and asking that the House should be informed what the position was, and, if possible, of the purport of the Treaty under negotiation ?In reply you would explain the situation as far as possible in the terms of j^our
(6.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies,(No. 318.   Secret.) April 25, 1922.My telegram No. 312 of 22nd April.Impressed, I think, of the trend of public opinion since the Kerbela Conference and by the attitude of the number of Sheikhs who have assembled here, Feisal sent for me to-day urgently to discuss the general situation, Cornwallis being present.Speaking at considerable length, he said he felt that for the past month his relations with us have been clouded, and that the resulting situation was unsatisfactory and disquieting, and he felt it was urgent to clear the air. He emphasised his irrevocable attachment to the British connection, and continued that he realised that he had perhaps made mistakes, but that anything that he had done, had been done in the belief that he was promoting the success of the policy, of which his coming out at our invitation was the essential, feature. He had to bear always in mind that we had expressed our inability to help him with money and troops outside the reduction programme, and he had to depend on his own exertions as far as possible.I replied that as far as he and His Majesty&apos;s Government were concerned, the question of the abrogation of the Mandate was the essential question at issue. As regards him and myself, he was aware that I thought his judgment bad been wrong in the matter of the dismissal of the Ministers and the encouragement of the Kerbela Conference. That, in my opinion, what was needed to clear the air was an announce-$tent of the final decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the Mandate question, and a full exposition of policy in that connection which could be imparted to the public. I had expressed that view- to you and hoped for a reply at any moment. Having got it, I thought Ave should give time to see what impression it made on the public mind, and that he and I and the Naqib should then take stock of the position and decide what course of action to recommend or to follow.He was in general agreement, and entirely agreed as to the great need for a public announcement of policy. Cox.proposed message to Feisal, and if it is not considered feasible to insert in the Treaty some clause on the lines suggested in my telegram No. 299, perhaps you could include an authoritative observation to an equivalent effect in your reply. If you could also communicate to the House the text of our final draft of the Treaty, and authorise me to make it known here, it would be more advantageous. It would then be arranged with Renter to telegraph your reply in extenso, and if received in this form it would furnish valuable propaganda at the present moment. It will no doubt arouse controversjr, but the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government being what you state, We had better face it frankly now. The announcement will, I think, be well received by the Sheikhs in their present temper, and by the people of Basra, while the Extremists will lose the opportunity that they now enjoy of discrediting a Treaty of which the generous terms are not known to the public.My suggestion that allusion should be specifically made to the alternative of retiring to the Basra Vilayet is made with two objects. It will help to ensure and strengthen the staunch adherence of Basra to the British connection, and will remind the Extremists of Baghdad of the risk they run of losing Basra if they push things too far.Anything in your draft message to Feisal which could not be included in your replying to the House could be telegraphed to Feisal simultaneously with the despatch of Reuter.I do not fully understand the reasons for which you favour a temporising course. I wall think the matter out, but I have explained the effect which such an expedient will have on the Constituent Assembly, and on the British personnel, and it seems to me full of dangerous possibilities. Cox.
(8.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 324.)There is no doubt that recent events have had an excellent effect both in strengthening moderates and chastening Feisal.He came to see me to-day to beg me not to let His Majesty &quot;s Government get impression that he would under any circumstances work against them or oppose their policy. If he found that he had undertaken a task which he could not bring to a successful issue he would retire into private life in England, but he would never forfeit our friendship.We then got down to business. He had now come to recognise strength and importance of moderate elements, and agreed that, when, final announcement of His Majesty s Government came, if it made clear the real portent of Mandate and real inability of Great Britain to divest herself of it, we (that is. he, myself and Naqib) should not throw up the sponge, but should labour to influence electorate to accept Treaty without abrogation of Mandate, provided that apart from that clauses of Treaty were generously fair.This is a great advance, and I think it well to inform you without delay. Cox..(9.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(Secret and Personal.) April 30, 1922.Your Personal and Secret, 29th April, which crossed my official telegram No. 324.General Officer Commanding is at Basra to-day, 30th April, considering on the spot question of defence of Basra, and I will submit our views in a day or two.As regards Treaty, owing to salutary effect caused by recent episodes, I feel pretty confident that omission of mention of Mandate in preamble and an interpola-tion on lines suggested in my telegram No. 299 would now satisfy Feisal and Naqib as far as Mandate question is concerned, and that they would sign Treaty if we can compose differences of view still prevailing regarding one or two articles. I still advocate dictation of proposed question and answer in House of Commons and publication of Treaty before we resume Treaty negotiations.   We must consider,Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissionerfor Iraq.(Secret and Personal.) April 27, 1922.I am carefully considering both the proposed question and answer in Parlia-ment, and at the same time, as an alternative, the new words suggested by you, and I will telegraph to you again in a day or two. Meanwhile, please clear up this point about Basra. We have always been told that it would take more troops to hold Basra without holding the interior of the country than to hold Baghdad as we are doing now. I have frequently used this argument, and I must be careful not to stultify myself in regard to it. What do you think you could hold Basra with 1 You might discuss this with the General. I agree with you in seeing great advantages in threatening to withdraw to Basra rather than retiring from the whole country, but it is necessary that there should be a practical military scheme behind it, even though we do not happen to expect to give effect to the threat.I am really very much obliged to you for the great assistance you are giving me in every aspect of these difficulties. I am far from giving up hope of getting through successfully, but I think Feisal must be brought to reason, and I never like to make a threat which one has not the power in a practical way to carry out if forced. If you think the psychological moment for bringing matters to a head has come, I will certainly not delay you beyond the middle of next week. Churchill.
therefore, precisely what draft Treaty to publish. In this connection please see my telegram No. 175 of 3rd March. Apart from Mandate question, which has been separately dealt with, the present position is&apos; as follows : Article 1. Feisal has so far adhered to his request for insertion,of words &quot; at the request of,&quot; which your draft omits. Can you not concede this&apos;? It does not seem crucial, and it certainly seems that position can be safeguarded by his obliga-tion to be guided by our advice in important matters.Article 3. Your draft adds words &quot; which shall be in conformity with present Treaty,&quot; which they have hitherto objected to. I suggest they might be given choice eitherjaf saying &quot; shall be drafted in consultation with High Commissioner (or with His Majesty&apos;s Government),&quot; or, &quot; shall be in conformity (or harmony) with present Treaty.&quot;Article 4. This is the one remaining article in regard to which I anticipate serious difficulty. They regard your wording as very severe. Can it not be eased a little?Article 5. I understand Colonial Office draft has been accepted by Cabinet. It will be accepted here.The other articles need no comment.With these remarks I respectfully leave to you precise text of Treaty for publication. Perhaps you could say Article 4 and question of Mandate were only important points on which final agreement had not been reached, and explain in what way it was hoped to adjust them.In referring to Feisal in your reply in House, I hope you will allude sympathe-tically to difficulty of his task in endeavouring to satisfy extremes of opinion rather than express annoyance or impatience at his recent excursion off the rails. I am sure you will agree that it is important not to let it appear that there has been anv rift between us and him Cox.(10.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.-(No. 329.) May 4, 1922.Reference to current correspondence. First : Feisal to-day invited me to resume Treaty negotiations, leaving the question of Mandate alone, and endeavouring to come to an agreement regarding other clauses. I replied that apart from the Mandate question financial clauses were only ones in regard to which much difference, of view still existed, and I would be prepared, if he wished, to discuss any possible modifications.Secondly : It is clear that result of Kerbela meeting has been to bring people into open and divide them into pro-British or pro-Mandate, and converse. Divisional advisers are being importuned for advice or a hint as to how cat is likely to jump, and ask urgently for an announcement of policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government which should not be delayed longer. Cox.(11.)Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissionerfor Iraq.(Personal and Private.) May 5, 1922.I do not like plan of making announcement in Parliament. Any indication that negotiations were breaking down would revive strong public opposition to our spending money on Iraq. Your telegram No. 324 of the 28th April and private telegrams of 30th April and 1st May give impression that all that is necessary now is an official statement of our views to Feisal on lines already indicated to you. I see no objection to your informing him at the same time that if he cannot see his way to sign Treaty, public statement will have to be made, but that, in present temper of British public result will almost certainly be demand for reduction of British commitments in Iraq.With regard to specific points raised in your telegram of the 30th April, I am prepared to give way on Article I; to accept either of alternatives now suggested by you for Article III; to accept Colonial Office draft for Article V; and to include
interpolation on lines suggested in your telegram No. 299. All mention of Mandate may also be omitted from Preamble. I am not quite clear what is wanted as regards Article IV. If our draft is too severe, FeisaFs original draft is not sufficiently precise.   Can you and he not arrive at alternative wording ? Churchill.(12.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 342.) May 11, 1922.Your telegram of 5th May.I addressed Feisal in the terms prescribed on 7th May, sending at the same time fresh draft of the Treaty brought up to date.   Copies by air mail.Feisal sent copies to the Prime Minister for discussion in Council one day this week. Meanwhile, he has sent me the ad interim reply in which he asks me to inform, you that he vehemently disclaims any idea, much less any wish, that the British should abandon Iraq, and that it is very painful to him to think that His Majesty&apos;s Government should have thought for a moment that he could entertain such feelings. If we went he would go, and his attitude in regard to the Mandate had been based on the sincere belief that a free Treaty was the surest way of cementing the British and Arab friendship.I saw him yesterday. He is highly strung as you know, and appeared genuinely upset in above connection. 1 replied that I did not suppose that you really thought that he personally wished us to go any more than I did, but that it was very real and lively contingency, and matters had come to a pass at which it was necessary to put the case plainly to him and have a plain answer.I think that it would be good, thing if you could send him short personal message, saying you could hardly doubt what his personal feelings would be. but it was necessary to speak plainly, and you are glad to have his personal disclaimer.  Cox.(13.)Telegram, from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissionerfor Iraq.May 13, 1922.Your telegram No. 342 of 11th May.Before considering despatch of personal message to Feisal I should be glad to learn exact terms of your communication to him.   Please report by telegraph.(14.)Decypher of a Telegram from, High Commissioner, Iraq.Telegram, from, the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 357.)Your telegram No. 281.My communication to Feisal, copies by air mail have gone to you, was practically transcription of draft communicated in your telegram No. 244 of 20th April.Particular passage which upset the King was (begins) : &apos;&apos; The question which the King should now address to himself,&quot; &amp;c, to end of telegram.Since the despatch of my telegram No. 342 of 11th May, I have had further lengthy discussions with the King and with the Naqib, and text of the Treaty has been discussed in principle.Feisal is now personally ready to come in over the Mandate question provided that we agree to one or two consequent adjustments in the wording of the other articles.   This I have little doubt we shall be able to do.Result of very intimate talk with the Naqib is that he admits as an Iraq land-owner prospect of some measure of Mandate is by no means unwelcome to him. On the other hand, he points out that by signing the Treaty placing Muslim State under
the Mandate of a Christian State he stands to gain nothing from the worldly point of view, while he thereby incurs great risk of damaging his spiritual prestige and influence in Islam. He has, however, given me his personal assurance that he is most anxious not to fail His Majesty&apos;s Government, and that if it should prove convenient, as an alternative to his resignation (which he is quite ready to place in our hands), he would agree to remain in office and accept situation loyally if another Minister were selected to act as plenipotentiary for the signing of the Treaty.This may provide a solution in last resort, but it will make Feisal&apos;s position more difficult. I would much prefer, if possible, to get the Treaty into a form which the Naqib will sign himself.Council have not finished the examination of the Treaty. I do not anticipate much trouble from them. It is a little difficult to prevent new hares being started and to get them to leave well alone, but I hope to telegraph recommendations at end of week. Cox.(15.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 370.)My telegram No. 357.  Last sentence.No further progress yet. Council have had several meetings but without specific result. It appeared that members of the Council hesitated to express their individual views without some definite indication of policy from Naqib, and latter hesitated to give any because he could get none from the King, whom he still understands to demand abrogation of the Mandate. On my pointing this out to the King and suggesting that he should now come into the open and give the Cabinet a line, he says that he cannot until he has secured the Treaty draft which he can produce, and says (begins) : &quot;We must accept Great britain&apos;s assurance that she cannot abrogate the Mandate; but our own relations with her are on the basis of this Treaty, which is the best we can expect in the circumstances, and safeguards our interests as well as hers.&quot;   (Ends.)Accordingly, we resume discussion of the draft on 26th May. Meanwhile, there is great deal of mischievous anti-Mandate propaganda going on, based in great measure on ignorance of what Mandate portends. In view of the decision in your telegram of 5th May, that any publicity at home would be imprudent at this juncture, I am doing what I can in way of counter-propaganda here, otherwise extremists who shout loudest will have it all their own way and queer pitch in advance. Cox.06.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 378.  Confidential.)Treaty negotiations have reached following stage. King asks for following modifications on following lines, and expresses confidence that if conceded he can count on Naqib&apos;s signature. Modifications are subject to confirmation in one or two details, but as Bairan Festival is at hand, I think it advisable communicate present position with reference to draft sent with my endorsement of the 11th May.Preamble.Retain clause 1, omit clauses 2, 3 and 4.

As an alternative wording I suggested that after words &quot; subject to provisions of this Treaty,&quot; we should insert words &quot; and- with due respect to the rights inseparable from national independence.&quot;   Thejr prefer their own wording, however.Article 3. Reason given for alteration proposed is that contents of organic law had no bearing on the greater part of the Treaty, and consequently it would be more logical to refer to the specific Articles rather than the Treaty as a whole. If you do not see reason to object in principle, please consider whether reference to four Articles mentioned suffices or not.   I am also considering this point.Article 4. Reason given, for omission of reference to the last sentence of Article 3. is that new wording provides for due consideration of our advice &quot; in all important matters,&quot; &amp;c, and this covers among other important matters those mentioned in Article 3.The King&apos;s draft refers &quot;His Britannic Majesty&quot; instead of &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government,&quot; and omits reference to our &quot;interests.&quot; King supports recom-mendation on the ground that extremist elements will criticise word and suggest we may have predominant interests, and that it is not right that Iraq should be required to accept guidance or advice which may be &quot; interested.&quot; If you find difficulty in agreeing to its omission, I suggest qualification by prefix of adjective &quot;legitimate&quot; or &quot;recognised.&quot;It will be noted that second part of Article 4 has been recast and provides for consultation with the High Commissioner instead of with His Britannic Majesty. Motive for this is to safeguard Iraq Government against interference or criticism by His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to detailed expenditure in estimates. It is contended that in this respect His Majesty&apos;s Government must rely on vigilance and cohesion of their men on the spot. Sassoon has strong convictions on this point. Slater Smallwood and I entirety support him in that attitude. Feisal asks for specific assurances on this point.

Article 3.In order to meet the King half-way, I had. previously suggested, in consultation with Financial Adviser, stipulation, that there should be nothing in Organic Law to impede the clue performance of the provisions of the Treaty.FeisaFs draft referring only to particular Articles after careful examination appears to us insufficient unless we can be quite sure that the Organic Law accepted by Feisal and ourselves will be passed by the Assembly. This, however, cannot be guaranteed, and it is possible that occasion might arise when Iraq Government would say: &quot;We cannot perform our obligations under a certain Article because the Constitution does not give us the power.&quot;Article 4.

Following for Shuckburgh :  I live in hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government will feel able to agree to Treaty in such a form that the publication of it will in itself sterilise present campaign of anti-Mandate propaganda and enable all our friends and Moderate elements to rally to it openly.Meanwhile, I must repeat my warning that extremists are having field to them-selves, and until they know final decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government neither King nor Naqib have courage to come into the open. The longer decision is delayed the more difficult does local situation become.Should His Majesty&apos;s Government not be able to meet aspirations of King entirely as regards terms of Treaty, I strongly recommend a public announcement by the Secretary of State on lines previously suggested, and saying that this is the utmost limit to which we can go, and, if Feisal or the people of Iraq do not like it, we shall retire to Basrah, or altogether, as may best suit us. In fact, I would like that said publicly in any case, if possible, as I am sure it will strengthen the hands of the Moderates&quot;.-Cox.(20.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 424.)

Secondly, party feeling between Extremists and Moderates is running high and displays itself in issue of manifestos and counter-manifestos, which must develop into breaches of peace.In hope that final announcement is imminent, I am loath to embitter feeling and create martyrs by resort to measures of suppression, but I must do so if further delay probable.

I presume word &quot;independent&quot; inadvertently retained both here and in Article 16.   Subject to its excision, I concur in draft preamble. Article 1. No objection.Article 3. You should press for retention of words &apos;&apos; shall be in conformity with provisions of present Treaty.&quot; There are many other Articles besides those quoted which might be stultified by a badly-framed Organic Law.Article 4. You may agree to wording given in my immediately following telegram. Article referred to should presumably have been 18 not 17, but as these Articles will now be inverted no correction is necessary. See my telegram No. 339 containing message to Feisal.Article 5. No objection.In view of contemplated Treaty with America, following should be inserted after &quot;League of Nations&quot; in Article 11 (begins) : &quot;or of any State to which His Britannic Majesty has agreed by Treaty that the same rights should be ensured as it would enjojr if it were a member of the said League.&quot;Article 9. For &quot; abrogation &quot; we must in deference to America substitute either &quot; suspension &quot; or &quot; non-application,&quot; since America claims that capitulatory rights should automatically revive on termination of Mandate unless she then agrees to their abrogation.Article 17. Insert following sentence between words &quot; twenty years &quot; and words &quot;nothing shall prevent&quot; in substitution for sentence to which exception is taken (begins) : &quot;at the end of which period the situation shall be examined, and, if the High Contracting Parties are of opinion that the Treaty is no longer required, it shall, subject to assent of the League of Nations, be terminated&quot; (ends).

His Majesty the King of Iraq will fully consult (or pay due regard to the advice of) the High Commissioner on what is conducive to a sound financial and fiscal policy, and will ensure the permanence and good organisation of the finances of the Iraq Government so long as that Government is under financial obligations to the Government of His Britannic Majesty.
13 (23.)Telegram, from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissionerfor Iraq.(No. 338.) June 15, 1922.I trust that my telegram No. 336 will finally solve outstanding difficulties and that you will be able to proceed to signature of Treaty.We could not possibly agree to phrase &quot; agrees to accord all due consideration to &apos;&apos; in Article 4. Feisal must surely realise that this is a meaningless undertaking since he could always assert that our arguments had been duly considered, but regret-fully rejected. Nor can we accept deletion of word &quot; interests,&quot; since &quot; obligations &quot; alone, whether international or financial, are not sufficiently comprehensive. I do not fully understand argument that substitution of High Commissioner for His Britannic Majesty involves any diminution of control by His Majesty&apos;s Government. Though I have accepted proposed modifications for local consumption, the High Commissioner will of course be responsible to His Majesty&apos;s Government in this as in all matters. If Feisal prefers that new Article 18 should be so drafted as to provide for possible disagreement between High Contracting Parties, you may agree to wording (begins) : &quot; and if either or both of the High Contracting Parties are of opinion &quot; (ends) instead of &quot; if the flight Contracting Parties are of opinion,&quot; and if he objects to &quot; assent of &quot; you may, in last resort, agree to &quot;confirmation by.&quot; Explanation of references to America is being sent by air-mail.The English and Arabic texts as finally signed should be sent by the first air-mail. Iam sending by next air-mail the English draft as finally approved here, but you need not await it if you are satisfied that our intentions are clear and delay is objectionable. The Treaty should not be published until I have had sufficient warning to arrange simultaneous publication here.You are authorised to give Feisal personal message in my immediately following telegram.(24.)Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissionerfor Iraq.(No. 339.) June 15, 1922.Following is message referred to in my immediately preceding telegram : (Begins) : 1 have never doubted your sincerity and am confident that you will work in closest friendship and co-operation with flight Commissioner in future as you have in the past. You will recognise that it was with reluctance that I felt bound to point out to you that insistence upon cancellation of Mandate, which merely defines our self-imposed responsibility to League of Nations, would have been incom-patible with continuance of our advice and support. I rely upon you now not merely to accept the Treaty for yourself, but to use every effort to carry the country with you when National Assembly meets to discuss it. Do not think that I have not realised your local difficulties. I fully realise them, and to the extent that we are free ourselves we have done our best to meet them. I trust that signature of this Treaty will mark commencement of a long period of prosperity and progress in Iraq.(25.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 432.) &apos;..

Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissionerfor Iraq.(No. 354.) June 23, 1922.Your telegram No. 432. You may refer to the provisions of Articles 17 and 18 as suggested.I still do not clearly understand position with regard to fiscal and financial control. It would be improper for Feisal to imagine that the High Commissioner had any status in Iraq other than that of representative of His Britannic Majesty or that he was in a position to offer advice independently of His Majesty&apos;s Government. If wording sanctioned by me in my telegram No. 338 confirms or gives rise to any such impression second half of Article should be worded in conformity with first half and should refer to advice of His Britannic Majesty tendered through High Commissioner. If, on the other hand, intention is merely that comment and criticism should ostensibly emanate from Pligh Commissioner, you may adopt wording given in that telegram.(27.)Telegram from, the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 458.)

Matter has since developed as follows : Fresh draft resulting from above telegrams was delivered to Feisal simul-taneously with your personal message, and I then had two interviews with him. At the second he acceptecl in principle, and in so far as he personally was concerned, that this draft was the final offer of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and that no further concession was to be expected. He then proceeded to make the following comments or requests :  Article 3. He did not like words &quot; in conformity with &quot; on the ground that it was not logical to refer to a permanent instrument like the Organic Law as being &quot; in conformity with &quot; a temporary document such as this Treaty. He decided that he would either leave this point to the Council of Ministers to settle or make the point academically in an. exchange of notes with me. He eventually took former course.Article 4. He accepted your draft, preferring the alternative &quot; will fully consult the High Commissioner &quot; in the second paragraph thereof.Article 9. Change of word &apos;&quot; abrogation &quot; disappointing to him, but he under-stood the difficulty and accepted &quot; non-application.&quot;Article 11. He acceptecl additional words desired by you.Article 18 (formerly 17). He did not like dependence on will of League of Nations and objected to word &quot; assent.&quot; but accepted &quot; confirmation.&quot;Subject to the foregoing,, he accepted Treaty for himself and proposed to send it to the Prime Minister for the views of the Council. I pressed him in doing so to give them a clear written direction of policy, as in the absence thereof they had hitherto been too timid either to accept or reject. He first said he would, but ulti-mately sent it without comment.Council have since had four meetings, during progress of which I have inter-viewed Naqib and various Ministers. I have now received copy of resolution signed by all Ministers accepting terms of Treaty subject to modifications indicated in my next following telegram. Cox..

Comment follows in my next telegram.(29.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 462.) June 28, 1922.My telegram No. 459 of the 27th June. I offer such comments as seem necessary.Preamble. Word &quot; constitutional &quot; was inserted at instance of Naqib, and i recommend its acceptance. Words &quot; state of &quot; were omitted by me, as I found that if inserted the addition of word &quot; independent &quot; would be pressed for.Article 3. There was strong opposition to the words &quot; in conformity with.&quot; 1 do not myself see what objection there is to alternative proposed.Article 4. Wording sanctioned in your telegram No. 338 and referred to lii No. 354 is retained. I do not consider that any wrong impression does or can exist as to the status of His Majesty&apos;s&apos; representative here or his position in relation to His Majesty&apos;s Government.Article 5. I presume there is no objection to insertion of word &quot; foreign.&quot; The insertion of full stop after word &quot; representation &quot; is a somewhat important and ingenious alteration. It was apparently an afterthought, as it was added in a supplementary communication from the Prime Minister. Article as modified will, of course, please the public enormously, and for that reason I recommend its acceptance if at all possible. Omission of words &quot;the interests of &quot; is. I think, unintentional and appears to be of no importance, and may be accepted. Similarly, omission of last sentence of Article is by oversight, but, as King and Council have accepted Article without it, it seems hardly worth while reopening question now unless we wish it ourselves.Article 7. Insertion of words &quot; Council of the &quot; in this Article and Article 18 is simply for the sake of symmetry with other Articles.Article 18. Insertion of words &quot; after its acceptance by Constituent Assembly &apos; is important.   But we have all along contemplated that Treaty had to be submitted to the Assembly for approval or otherwise, and without this measure of mitigation of their responsibility to the country, neither Naqib nor Ministers would have.had courage to sign to acceptance of Treaty.   Comment ends.
I am sending you a separate appreciation of political situation. It is most urgent that Treaty should be published at earliest possible moment, as the extremists depend for propaganda mainly on. misrepresentation of its supposed contents and of the mandatory position. All I await now is your final decision on these last modifications and your authority to sign and publish.(30.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 463.) - June 28, 1922.Political situation has become sharply defined during the past fortnight. Telegrams of protest against the Mandate engineered by Khalisi and company have been received from provinces by myself and Naqib, followed by counter-telegrams and memorials definitely asking for Mandate from leading Sheikhs, who since Kerbela meeting have been definitely and fearlessly opposed to extremists&apos; antics. This stand on their part has been very remarkable, a!nd it should be added that while religious leaders in Najaf and Kerbela are known to have been urged by extremists to pronounce a fatwa against Treaty nothing has yet resulted, and many of the Ulama are generally believed to be in tacit opposition to Khalisi. During last few days extremists have brought great pressure to bear on Naqib personally, organising small groups of protestors to visit him and threaten him with alarming consequences if Treaty is signed without definite repudiation of Mandate. They have also summoned to Baghdad a party of anti-Mandate Sheikhs and Saiyids of Euphrates to join in their demonstrations, but these have been sharply dealt with by King who has extracted from them oaths on Quran that they will leave guidance of affairs to him, and implicitly obey his orders. Pro-Mandate Sheikhs and Saiyids are now gathering in Baghdad and are being well received by King. Ja&apos;far Abu Timman has resigned his post as Minister of Commerce after recording a minute of dissent from his colleagues in regard to certain passages in Treaty. It is popularly under-stood that he resigned by order of King and had no other course, especially as he knew that his Ministry had been recommended for suppression by our geddes Committee. Extremists are snarling and threatening demonstrations in Baghdad, but it is doubtful whether these will materialise, and in any case Government are fully prepared to arrest instigators. An attempted hartal of Shi&apos;ah shopkeepers, arranged by Khalisi for 24th, was effectively nipped in the bud. Baghdad Sunni notables without exception are rejoiced that agreement has been reached over Treaty, including those who took part in agitations of 1920. It is everywhere rumoured that terms of Treaty are eminently satisfactory, and great desire &quot;for its immediate publication is expressed. Once it is out the notables and pro-Treaty Sheikhs are prepared to form a strong combine through country for purpose of securing election of suitable candidates to Congress. I have informed Prime Minister that I agree to commencement of election business as soon as Treaty is signed and published,, but not before. Cox.(31.)Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissionerfor Iraq.(No. 361.) &apos; June 29, 1922.I saw General Haddad recently. He left with me a note on the Mandate in. Iraq, of which a copy is being sent by air-mail, in which the extremist arguments are recapitulated. He definitely stated that this note represented Feisal&apos;s personal views, and in subsequent conversation with Department he said that if Treaty did. not abrogate Mandate Feisal would make it clear locally that he had signed under compulsion. I do not attach undue importance to this statement, but I feel that you and Feisal should know what Haddad is saying, and that you should ascertain without question that Feisal will support any Treaty he may eventually sign. Your telegram No. 458 just received confirms my view.
Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissionerfor Iraq.(No. 363.) June 30, 1922.Your telegrams No. 462, &amp;c., Iraq Treaty. Progress you have achieved is most gratifying, and report on general situation in your No. 463 strikes me as very satisfactory. Please convey to Peisal and his Council my appreciation of accommodating spirit shown by them. I am anxious to meet them in similar spirit, and gladly accept all amendments proposed in your telegram No. 459 with single exception of those relating to Article 5. Text of that Article in draft of 13th June was result of decision taken in Cabinet following upon protracted interdepartmental discussion. It would be useless to reopen question with Cabinet, particularly as Feisal himself accepted our draft and modifications suggested by Council do not seem to have been very carefully thought out. You should explain to Feisal and his Government that on this one point His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot give way. If our Article 5 is accepted you may sign Treaty forthwith. As regards date of publication, I will arrange to publish on 6th July unless I hear to contrary. Yod should telegraph &quot;clear line &quot; as soon as you have signed.(33.)Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissionerfor Iraq.(No. 376.) July 5, 1922.My telegram No. 361. Haddad now reports receipt of telegram from Feisal dated 26th June, stating that Council have decided to &quot; leave Mandate question under protest&quot; while approving Treaty. Feisal is represented as sincerely regretting conflict of British and Arab influence in administration, alleged pro-Mandate propaganda by British adviser, Nasiriyeb, his own lack of information regarding Kurdistan and danger involved in Wahabi pilgrimage to Mecca. Note referred to in mv telegram under reference is said to be in FeisaFs possession. You should obtain copy since I cannot furnish one until next air-mail. Feisal is alleged to fear precedent of Anglo-Persian Agreement. I suggest you should point Out to him once more that we expect him to associate himself, if not with Mandate as such, at least with demand for British assistance which His Majesty &quot;s Government can only give in Mandatory capacity. Refusal by Assembly to ratify Treaty would not modify decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and if he really wishes for our help he and his Government must use every effort to secure acceptance. It would be interesting to know whether communications to Haddad are seen and approved by Feisal personally.(34.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 480.) July 5, 1922.I much regret to tax your patience with a further Treaty telegram, but, in making final comparison between English and Arabic versions, we have been unable to-agree upon a rendering of following words of Article 18 : &quot; Subject to confirmation by League of Nations,&quot; and, as His Majesty informs me that he had not fully appreciated the meaning of the English, I do not feel justified in refusing his request (supported as it is by Prime Minister and Council) for a further reference to you on the explicit condition that no further point will be raised.Foregoing was communicated to and accepted by His Majesty and Council of State before despatch.They now earnestly request that His Majesty&apos;s Government will agree to the following wording : &quot;And if High Contracting Parties are then of opinion that the Treaty is no longer required, it shall be terminated and their decision communicated to Council of.the League of Nations.&quot;[8804] d

(35-)   . .     .Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State [forthe Colonies,(No. 486.) July 8, 1922.Your telegram No. 376. It was not true on 26th June when Feisal telegraphed, and it is still not true, that Council, while approving Treaty, &apos;&apos; have decided to leave Mandate question under protest,&quot; but it is true that considerable pressure has been exercised upon them from the Palace to induce them to record such a resolution. As I was not sure whether pressure came from King himself or only from his entourage, and as Naqib and the majority of Council appreciated inappropriateness and impracticability of such a resolution, I had contented myself with asking Naqib not to agree to any resolution without consulting me and by informing him that if the resolution in those terms came to me as usual for concurrence I should send it back and suspend Treaty negotiations pending consultation with you.I hoped the proposal would come to nothing. As, however, your telegram No. 376 made it quite clear that it was the deliberate purpose of the King. I confronted him with telegram this morning in the presence of Cornwallis. I pointed out that his statement that Council &quot;had decided&quot; was not true up to date. I reminded him that three weeks ago, understanding some members of Council were in difficulty on this point, I had myself suggested to him and Naqib a formula which seemed to me innocuous and that, if that had not seemed to suffice, the straight course to take was to consult me again and not to put pressure on Council by indirect means. I continued that I had already drafted a telegram to you asking you to meet their difficulty of accepting in your public announcement in connection with Treaty, but had held it up pending this interview with him. After he had expressed contrition for his want of candour, conversation followed of which following is gist: He urged that however generous terms of the Treaty were, and notwithstanding Mandate was not mentioned in it, yet all thinking people were aware that Mandate was behind it, and that Iraq&apos;s position was in. fact that of a Mandated State. From that position Iraq hoped, with the sympathy and co-operation of Great Britain (which they all wanted), to escape long before the expiry of twenty years. What he now feared was that if in recording acceptance of Treaty, Iraq did not record something to preserve her right in the future to plead for abolition of the status of &quot; Mandated State,&quot; you might go to League of Nations next week and say : &quot;In the form of this Treaty Iraq has accepted. Mandate.&quot; I replied that I appreciated his point of view and, as above mentioned, had intended asking you to try and meet their difficulty in. your Treatjr announcement. Finally, he agreed to drop his present pressure on Council and seek, in consultation with me, a formula for a resolution of the Council which I thought would be unobjectionable. We then went on to the question of the election policy, which I. am dealing with in a separate message. Cox.(36.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State &quot;for .. &apos; the Colonies.(No. 487.) July 9, 1922.My telegram immediately preceding. It was agreed that, having got Treaty, we heed to come to an agreement as to the platform on which elections were to go forward.  Feisal asked my views on this point.I replied that it had been my confident hope that, on seeing terms of Treaty, public would realise that we had really gone to utmost limit to content them and that the pro-Mandate and anti-Mandate parties now in such heated controversy would become merged into predominant pro-Treaty party. I continued that it was essential that election issue should be acceptance and support of the Treaty and not acceptance or rejection of the Mandate.    I was sorry to see, however, that, owing to now
(37.)Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissionerfor Iraq.(Private and Personal.) * July 13, 1922.It is clear from your telegrams Nos. 486 and 487 that Feisal does not appreciate full significance of Article 6 of draft Treaty, which in effect gives the undertaking which you now propose should be given by a special announcement. I fully appreciate motives which animate Feisal, though I am gravely disappointed at the methods which he has seen fit to adopt to secure his objects. Debate yesterday on Middle Eastern services gave me opportunity to make statement on general lines suggested by you (see my telegram No. 396). I have also secured Foreign Office assent to an addition being made to Article 18, which will tend to emphasise the point that admission of Iraq to League of Nations within Treaty period is regarded by us as bv no means improbable contingency. Proposed addition will also make it clear that even if Mandatory relation comes to an end with admission of Iraq to League, Treaty will still remain in operation.[8804]undisguised support of them, anti-Mandate extremists, instead of discussing suitability or unsuitability of the Treaty, persistently ignored Treaty and still propaganded violently against Mandate. As soon as Treaty was signed, I looked to His Majesty to keep his promise and come out into open support of Treaty boldly and stop all this extremist propaganda. To this end it was essential that he should make a. public announcement of his policy simultaneously with publication of Treaty for the guidance of the people during the elections. I added that the ideal course would be that you (Mr. Churchill) should make an announcement in the House of Commons which would come here through Reuter&apos;s, and that Feisal should follow it up with one here.Feisal entirely agreed, with above in principle. He went on to say, however; that we must face fact (already referred to in my last telegram) that a considerable and articulate element in the country resented being in the position of a Mandate State and would continue to agitate against it unless they could be given some hope of early escape from it. If the elections were to be successfully run on the Treaty issue and not on the Mandate question, some step must be taken to quiet anti-Mandate cry. He had hoped to do this to some extent by the resolution of the Council indicated in my last message, but he must also do so, if possible, in his Treaty announ cement.I told him that I appreciated fact that thanks to his support of it anti-Mandate party was not dead and that I would ask you to consider this point of view and assist us if possible in your own Treaty announcement.I recognise that vis-a-vis Allies and the League of Nations it may be very difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Government to make any announcement which as it were seeks to explain aw^ay Mandate principle. If we wish to avoid trouble here, however, something has to be done to appease or disarm anti-Mandate element. Perhaps you could say something on these lines :  &quot; In the course of these Treaty negotiations, which have been in progress several months, His Majesty&apos;s Government have realised firstly to what an extraordinary extent the term &apos;&apos;Mandate &apos; has come to be misunderstood and misapplied, and secondly that the vigorous national sentiments which have been aroused in Eastern countries as a result of the world war show strong disinclination to accept in principle status of Mandated State. In drawing up Treaty, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have done their utmost to take sympathetic account of these phenomena, and the people of Iraq may rest assured that Great Britain will give them full co-operation in gaining admittance to League of Nations, before which as occasion arose Iraq could plead her own cause.&quot;If you could say something like this, Feisal could make it a basis for urging his people not to exercise their minds about the Mandate, but to rally to the Treaty.His statement regarding the action of the Adviser, Nasiriyah, was disproved and settled by telegram of confidence in. the name of the King and Government of Iraq to Major Yetts.Kurdish question I have not had time to touch briefly on, but he was reassured bv your reference to the subject as reported in Reuter wdiich had just arrived.

(39.)Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissionerfor Iraq.(No. 401.) July 13, 1922.My telegram No. 400.(Begins) : &quot; This Treaty shall come into force as soon as it has been ratified by the High Contracting Parties after its acceptance by the Constituent Assembly and shall remain in force for twenty years, at the end of which period the situation shall be examined, and if the High Contracting Parties are of opinion that the Treaty is no longer required it shall be terminated. Termination shall be subject to confirma-tion by the League of Nations, unless before that date Article 6 of this Treaty has come into effect, in which case notice of termination shall be communicated to the Council of the League of Nations &quot; (ends).(40.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(Private and Personal.) July 12, 1922.The following is the sort of resolution which His Majesty&apos;s Government will probably be asked to consider. First sentence is what I originally expressed my&apos; &apos;primd facie readiness to accept as sufficient and harmless. Second sentence is new as a result of recent developments :  Council resolves that the terms of the Treaty with Great Britain as set forth in eighteen articles laid before them to-day be accepted, on the hypothesis that as between Great Britain and Iraq it is the sole document defining the relations between the two countries.&quot; In recording this resolution Iraq Government request His Britannic Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner to make known to His Majesty&apos;s Government on their behalf, with reference to the special responsibility which Great Britain has accepted from the League of Nations in regard to Iraq, that recent developments have convinced the Government of Iraq that the whole Mandatory idea as at present understood is repugnant to the feelings of the majority of the inhabitants, and the said Govern-ment therefore begs His Majesty&apos;s Government, in anticipation of their own entry into the League, to appeal to the League on their behalf to abandon or reconsider their Mandatory policy and to recognise joint responsibility of the two States under the Treaty now approved.&quot;Is something of this sort possible? Cox.(41.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(Private.) July 13, 1922.Your telegram No. 361 of the 5th July. I have received to-day, the 13th July, from Feisal copy of note by Haddad on mandate enclosing the opinion of Dr. PearceTelegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissionerfor Iraq.(No. 400.) July 13, 1922.Your telegram No. 480. His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot agree that terminal tion of Treaty shall merely be communicated to Council of League of Nations unless by that time Iraq is herself a member in accordance with Article 6. They cannot, therefore, agree to alternative wording proposed, but are prepared to accept that first clause of Article 18 should read as given in my immediately succeeding telegram. Second clause of Article to remain unchanged.
Higgins. I presume that this is the document to which your telegrams Nos. 361 and 376 refer.It no doubt accounts for Feisal&apos;s recent activity in regard to the Mandate -question. At a recent interview I reminded him that I had given him ail support that I properly could in regard to this question up to the moment when we got a definite answer from His Majesty&apos;s Government. Having received that reply, I had accepted it as final, and thought he had. He replied that, from what he heard from England or read in the home papers, public opinion in England did not agree with opinion of the Colonial Office. He was no doubt thinking of the note which he must have recently received from Haddad. Cox.(42.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 503.   Secret.) July 16, 1922.I have reason to think that Feisal is playing for time in the belief or hope that at the present sitting of the Council of the League of Nations something may transpire in connection with the Mandate question which he and the extremists can take advantage of. It would therefore be useful if Renter could telegraph somewhat as follows :  &quot; It is understood that at the present meeting of the Council of the League no question re Iraq or the Iraq Mandate will come up for discussion.&quot; Cox.(43.)Telegram, from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissionerfor Iraq.(No. 405.) . July 18, 1922.Your telegram No. 503.Lord Balfour informed Council of League to-day that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment were not ready for discussion of Iraq Mandate. It is understood that Reuter has telegraphed this.References to Treaty of Peace with Turkey are being eliminated from all &quot; A &quot; Mandates, since it is considered undesirable to refer to unratified document. Only exception is Article dealing with antiquities, where reference to Annex to Article 421 must necessarily be preserved. This affects Article 14 of Treaty with Feisal, which should now be redrafted, as in my immediately following telegram. Presume Feisal has no objection to new wording or to addition providing for inclusion of America, as in case of Article 11 (eleven).(44.)Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissionerfor Iraq.(No. 406.) &apos; July 18, 1922.His Majesty the King of Iraq undertakes to secure within twelve months of the coming into force of this Treaty the enactment of a Law of Antiquities based on the rules annexed to Article 421 of the Treaty of Peace signed at Sevres on the 10th August, 1920, and to ensure its execution. The former Ottoman Law of Antiquities by this law shall be replaced, which shall ensure equality of treatment to the nationals of all States members of the League of Nations in the matter of archaeological research, and also to the nationals of any State to which by Treaty His Britannic Majesty has agreed that the same rights should be ensured as if it wrere a member of the said League it would enjoy.
(45.)Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies- to the High Commissionerfor Iraq.(Private and Personal.) July 18, 1922.Your private telegrams of 12th and 13th July.Feisal is quite mistaken in thinking that public opinion here supports his plea for abrogation of Mandate. House of Commons supported policy of Government by large majority on occasion referred to in my telegram No. 396. Parliament and the public would, of course, be delighted at any proposal to quit the country at once and avoid all further expense. A very bad impression is created when Feisal is seen repeating in Iraq the same unreasonable behaviour that led to his expulsion from Syria. Nothing would be easier than for me to carry a policy of an immediate and total withdrawal of all help of any kind.In view of suggested addition to Article 18 and of decision of Parliament, Feisal will no doubt realise that second sentence of draft Council resolution is unnecessary and undesirable. If any addition to first sentence is considered necessary it should take form of unqualified approval of Treaty and grateful recognition of Articles 6 and 18 as now amended. Any official encouragement of extremists would lead to undesirable consequences during elections. Churchill.(46.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 512.) July 21, 1922.Feisal has raised certain &quot;questions of working interpretation of passages in Treaty. Signature of Treaty does not depend on them in any way, and I have referred them by despatch. One point, however, is of lively urgency, and I therefore refer it by telegraph at feisal&apos;s request.Article 11. Words &quot;of other than Iraq nationality.&quot; Feisal raised the point when Young and I were discussing Articles of the Treaty with him, and I think that&apos; we remarked that presumably embargo would not be applied to &quot; Arabs,&quot; e.g., Fladdad; but that again as a definition would need some amplification. Would it cover Egyptians 1 I should be glad to know in the first instance what was in the mind of the drafter of the Article and to receive your views or instructions. Cox.(47.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe ^Colonies.(No. 522.) ^ July 26, 1922.King and Government of Iraq have accepted the conclusion of Article 18 and tail of Treaty as indicated in your telegram No. 399.They have also accepted the revision of Article 18 and tail of Treaty in terms of your telegram No. 401 after receiving assurance from me that operationof Article 6 would in no way be prejudiced thereby.They have also accepted the revised version of Article 14 as desired in your telegram No. 406.As regards the text of the Treaty, therefore, there is no point of difference now outstanding, but question of the terms of Council resolution for purposes of publication is still the subject of lively discussion, and I am dealing with it in a separate telegram.Meanwhile the air-mail has brought the printed copy of the draft Treaty corrected in manuscript by Major Young.One or two verbal discrepancies are apparent which I am repeating en clair in. my telegram following.I request that your draft may be altered accordingly.

My telegram IVo. 363 explicitly stated that draft of 13th June must stand. Foreign Office have, however, agreed to deletion of words &quot;the interests of.&quot; They cannot agree to omission of last sentence, which gives Plis Majesty&apos;s Government deciding voice in appointment of foreign representatives.

In any case, past experience of appointment of Iraqis in Syria and Syrians in Transjordania emphasises need of strict adherence to letter of Treaty.(51-)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 528.) - July 28, 1922.My separate telegrams have informed you that text of Treaty is now complete and only awaits signature. Question of proposed Council resolution, however, referred&apos; to in your telegram of 18th July, is still an obstacle to its conclusion, and I have been unable to bring King to your point of view. Pie tells me that he had hoped that Treaty omitting as it does all reference to Mandate might be signed and brought&quot; into operation, but that, nevertheless, he and the elements of his people who hold same strong views would be free to work by constitutional methods for the abrogation or specific termination .of Mandate. I informed him that in these circumstances I should neither feel justified as His Britannic Majesty&apos;s representative in signing the Treaty without first explaining position fully to you, nor in any case would I personally be prepared to face the worries which I was convinced would result from conclusion of Treaty followed by continuance of present agitation against Mandate, and that in my judgment we must get to grips regarding this question once for all, and settle it before Treaty was signed.   His Majesty said that he would consider the matter deliberately, and put
me in possession of his conclusions. He has now asked me to present his views to you as follows :  He, personally, has always been frankly and fundamentally opposed to Mandatory system. He now fears that if this Treaty is concluded without any reservation being publicly recorded by himself or Government of Iraq, which will leave door open for appeal against Mandate, His Majesty&apos;s Government (notwith-standing British public is said not to be least keen on the Mandatory relationship) will go to League of Nations and say, &quot; Here is the Mandate as originally drafted, and accompanying it is the Treaty by which we propose to carry it out. Iraq has accepted position and we ask you to approve both documents.&quot; Thus Iraq would be estopped from freeing herself from the position of Mandated State indefinitely. In his opinion, if he or Government of Iraq at present epoch became parties to arrangement which placed Iraq in that fettered position country- would turn upon him and them directly they understood what had been done. At the present time Iraq is surrounded by enemies or restless neighbours, and unless the people are contented and united and unless their understanding with Great Britain is frank and complete the country will have no rest and there will be no escape from ultimate disaster. It is his unalterable opinion that by means of some formula, some resolution of Council, or some declaration on the part of himself or His Majesty&apos;s Government, it must be made plain to people of Iraq that the door of escape from Mandatory position is not closed upon them by the conclusion of Treaty, and that while abiding loyally by the terms of it, it will be open to them to work by constitutional methods for the termination of Mandate. If that possibility is definitely denied to them he feels that Treaty, if signed, will have no chance of success. He therefore appeals to the broad sentiments of British freedom and the high statesmanship of His Majesty&apos;s Government in urging them to go the whole way in their treatment of Iraq, and indeed Arab world in general, by making Iraq&apos;s case their own, and by asking League of Nations when presenting Treaty not to approve it as an instrument and part of Mhndate, but as replacing latter altogether. His Majesty makes this appeal after reading all that has passed on the subject, including your latest observations in Parliament, and he is aware of your difficulties, but he is convinced that if England has the will to do so she can find a formula either for a resolution by Govern-ment of Iraq or for a, communication to League of Nations which will meet requirements of international politics, and at the same time satisfy aspirations of Iraq. If he can convince his people that the cloor of. escape from Mandate is not closed by the conclusion of Treaty, and tell them that they may rely on him (it is hoped with the co-operation of Great Britain) to pursue matter constitutionally before the League of Nations, he is confident that he can stop all the anti-Mandate agitation in this country, and that he will have a united people behind him in concentrating his efforts on the successful working of the Treaty. He says in conclusion that he must declare frankly and once for all that he and those who think with him will at all times and in all places continue in legitimate ways to demand removal of Mandate.End of King feisal&apos;s representation.Point at issue is of course a fundamental one, but the difficulty involved in its solution seems to me to lie not so much in any divergence of sentiment or motive between His Majesty&apos;s Government and Feisai&apos;s, but rather in the task of getting our Allies and the League of Nations to a solution which may stultify or affect other Mandatory arrangements adversely by comparison. Yet the success of our policy in this country will be so vitally affected by nature of arrangements that we arrive at now, that I earnestly hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government will leave no channel unexplored to find magic formula. Cox.(52.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(Secret and Personal.) July 29, 1922.I fear problem presented to you in my telegram No. 528 of the 28th July is full of difficulties, not the least of which lies in the character of the King whom we have set up. Apart from the merits or demerits of the aims which he has in view, the tactics which he has employed in the pursuit of them have undoubtedly been insincere and
crooked, and it is difficult to place any trust in him. Only hope is that if we can find-a solution of the present difficulty he will start a fresh chapter and play the game. In case His Majesty&apos;s Government come to the conclusion that it is out of the question for them to take action before the League of Nations in the direction desired, I venture to revert to the suggestion that Feisal and I should proceed to London by air in the hope that agreement may be reached by personal discussion.(53.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 531.) July 31, 1922.Your telegrams Nos. 433 and 436 of 28th and 29th July.Necessary action is being taken. I regret misunderstanding about Article 5. I was misled by words in your telegram No. 363 &quot; modifications suggested by Council &quot; and &quot; one point &quot; in the sentence following. I understand you accepted &quot; omissions &quot; which has not been intentional and had no special significance at this end. Cox.(54.)Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissionerfor Iraq.(Personal and Secret.) August 3, 1922.Your telegram of 29th July.After carefully considering all the circumstances, I think it will be advantageous if Feisal and yourself could be in England during the first three weeks of September. No further progress can be made by telegraphic discussions, and I should like to have the opportunity of meeting the King again and reviewing the wdiole situation with him. Would he be willing to come? Would the Iraq position be safe in his absence and yours ? Presumably he can travel via, Trieste and Germany to avoid irritating the French.   Telegraph what you advise. Churchill.(55.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretanj of State forthe Colonies.(No. 554.   Secret and Personal.) August 10, 1922.Your secret and personal telegram of 3rd August.Idea of visiting England at the present juncture does not commend itself to King unless he is assured of a successful issue as regards Mandate question, and unless he could be permitted to make an announcement before leaving that the principle of emancipation from the Mandate was conceded and that he was going home to arrange the precise, method of achieving it. Your telegram gives no indica-tion that His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared or able to alter their attitude regarding the Mandate.Official telegram follows. Cox.(56.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 555.) August 10, 1922.Assuming that His Majesty&apos;s Government have considered contents of my tele-gram of 27th July, No. 528, and are not able to recede from position last taken up,, following alternative solution is suggested after consultation between King, Corn-wallis and myself : Position is that as regards the Treaty we have arrived at agree-merit in regard to all details, and it only awaits signature, but this is rendered impossible by the failure of the parties to come to an understanding in regard to the Mandate. This being so, it is suggested that His Majesty&apos;s Government should now make a formal announcement to the people of Iraq, publishing the text of the Treaty [8804] &apos; &apos; &quot; e
and explaining our international difficulties regarding the Mandate question, and emphasising the great difference, to the advantage of Iraq, existing between the arrangement first contemplated and that now reached in the Treaty. In continuation the announcement would say in effect: &quot; These are the best terms that we can arrange because we are not entirely free. You must take them or leave them. We wish to stay and help you because it is a point of honour, but we do not wish to force our help upon you. It is for you to decide not as to whether Mandate is a good or a bad thing, but whether the terms which we have been able to offer are better than the anarchy which will probably result if we go. If you decide not to accept the arrangement, then we will evacuate, but will still be ready to remain your friends. Elections for the General Assembly will take place shortly, and will not be interfered with in any way by any British official. If a majority in the Assembly decide that arrangement offered is not acceptable, evacuation will be begun forthwith.&quot;Alternative of allowing the elections to take place while Feisal backs the anti-Mandate and we back moderates is to my mind an impossible solution and undignified from the point of view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and it would almost surely result in armed turmoil in the country, of which it is impossible to see the end.In regard to the solution above suggested King Feisal gave me his solemn word of honour in the presence of Cornwallis that if British personnel stood aside during the elections he would punctiliously do the same and would take no action calculated to influence the people against the offered terms and assured me that he fully recog-nised that he must accept the decision of the Assembly whether in favour or in reject-tion of our offer, and that if the Assembly accepted the Treaty with the Mandate he would work loyally on that policy and subordinate to it his personal objections to the Mandatory principle.  This solution will have the following advantages : It will put us right with the public and with Islam and greatly ease our position and that of the King. It will take the wind out of the extremist sails and force all who care for the country to take a definite line. In the eA&quot;ent of a vote in favour of acceptance of the offer, which I confidently expect, it will enable us to combine Avith the people of Iraq on terms of stable friendship. If this solution commends itself to His Majesty&apos;s Government I strongly urge that it be inaugurated at once, as the situation here is becoming daily more unsatisfactory. Extremists are endeavouring to make the people believe that the Treaty and the Mandate are to be forced upon them, and that the only thing that will prevent this movement is organised agitation. Cox.(57.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(Secret and Personal.) August 10, 1922.Draft of my telegram No. 555 Avas shown to and accepted by Feisal. I have private information that suggestion that he should proceed to London at this juncture alarmed Feisal and that he suspected that he Avould be asked to resign. For this reason, I am pretty confident that if solution now recommended is adopted he will do his best to see that terms are accepted by Assembly.As I have suggested on several occasions, it would give point to public announce-ment proposed if allusion Avere made to possibility of our retaining Basrah. In any case, in the event of our deciding on evacuation, Basrah Avould in all probability demand special treatment as a Protectorate or Crown Colony. If you could say that special consideration would be given to the wishes of the inhabitants of Basrah it would be quite enough.

Reference to sentence re non-interference of British officers in elections. If you could add that we had asked King&apos;s assurance that the same non-interference should be observed by Iraq officials, it would be
salutary. Failing that, I would propose to address Council of State and ask them to cause circular orders to be issued and published forbidding officials from attempting to influence elections, Cox.(59.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 561.) August 12, 1922.I beg to report the following for information of His Majesty&apos;s Government. In the discussions of past few months regarding Mandate, one of main of the anti-Mandate arguments has been that Great Britain might at any time be tempted to imitate action of France in regard to Cilicia by restoring an integral part of Iraq, such as whole or part of Mosul vilayet, to the Turks. Feisal has repeatedly alluded to this possibility. I have always replied that once the Anglo-Iraq Treaty is concluded such action would, thereafter be a specific violation, of it, in my opinion. The imminent reopening of negotiations between the Powers and. Turkey has revived this talk in a lively way, and the fear is now being widely expressed that Great Britain may surrender vilayet of Mosul or the Kurdish portions of it.As it is important not to provide electors with any plank of this sort, it would be very convenient if you could dispel suspicion or authorise me to. Cox.(60.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of Stale forthe Colonies.(No. 566.) August 14, 1922.My telegram No. 555 of 10th August.   Last sentence.August 23rd will be anniversary of the King&apos;s coronation, and in absence of any announcement to clear the air before that, might be seized upon as a suitable occasion for demonstration against the Mandate or Treaty or King, I hope, therefore, that announcement or conclusions of His Majestv&apos;s G-overnment mav reach me before that......-Cox. &apos;:l&apos;WA(61.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 574.) August 16, 1922.During the past few days numerous mazbatas or letters addressed to the news-papers, the King and myself have been coming from different sections of extremists factions, principally from Shamiyeh division, making such demands as (1) declaration of the abrogation of the Mandate by Great Britain; (2) rejection of the Treaty in its present form; (3) dismissal of present Cabinet for having pusillanimously agreed to the terms of the Treaty; (4) transfer of management of Anglo-Iraq relations from the Colonial Office to the Foreign Office; (5) dismissal of British personnel, removal of the censorship.I do not take these too seriously, and regard them as bluff on the part of extremists, fortified by the knowledge that their demands for the most part have the sympathy of the King; but if given time they may carry their bluff to a point when active disturbance may seem so imminent that repressive measures may be indicated, not by Government of Iraq, but by the High Commissioner and Imperial troops. It is of the highest importance to avoid such a development if possible. I very much&quot; hope, therefore, that you can soon give me something to clear the rdr. I may mention that some versions of the Treaty (probably incorrect ones) are being circulated privately among the extremists for purposes of hostile criticism, so that it is the more desirable to give out a correct one.

28 (62.)Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissionerfor Iraq.(No. 485.   Private and Personal.) August 16, 1922.Following from Masterton Smith : Your telegram No. 571 of 16th August. Questions raised in your telegram No. 550 and connected telegrams have been referred to Secretary of State, who is in France. Hope decision can be communicated in five or six days. Meanwhile, please telegraph urgently whether Feisal realises danger of delay, and would sign Treaty at once if we insisted that he should do so by given date without further argument, alternative being no Treaty at all. What do you anticipate would result from signature so obtained or alternatively from continuance of present undefined regime if ultimatum not complied with ?(63.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies..(No. 576.)   , August 17, 1922.Your telegram No. 465 of 16th August.   Following for Masterton Smith :-(Private and Personal.)I doubt if we shall be able to maintain position for five or six days longer without occurrence of some unfavourable development involving either application of forcible measures to suppress or surrender in some direction to agitation. Yesterday, at interview with Feisal, before receipt of your telegram alluding to delay in receipt of reply from Secretary of State, I reminded him that principal signatories of manifestos that were coming in were persons known to be under his influence, and that it should consequently be easy for him to keep them quiet for a few days pending announcement from London. In point of fact, however, it was easier for him to set the ball rolling than it now is for him to stop it even if he wished to. Feisal wTas prepared, and no doubt still is, for signature of Treaty provided Iraq Government are allowed to attach to it a resolution indicating non-acceptance of Mandate and provided that he is not debarred from continuing to propagand against it.Simplest solution no doubt is to let him record that resolution for what it is worth, then get Treaty signed and: trust to good sense of moderate majority gradually to suppress extremist agitation against Mandate. It is not a satisfactory solution, and I was not prepared to be a party to it without a full explanation to His Majesty&apos;s Government, but if His Majesty&apos;s Government with their eyes open wish it I am prepared to sign. Thereafter, if Feisal still persevered in or continued to allow anti-Mandate agitation I should ask to be relieved in protest. Ultimatum to Feisal, in. my opinion, is out of the question. It would merely make a martyr of him, and provide a fresh stimulus to extremists. Only possible ultimatum is one to people of Iraq as indicated in my telegram No. 555. Nor can we possibly defer Treaty and continue present regime    Tension has already reached breaking point.A conceivable alternative is that we should make a public announcement that as King Feisafs Government have not been able to satisfy us we are no longer prepared to interpret Mandate by a Treaty, and propose to revert to pre-Feisal temporary Government until peace had been reached with Turkey. This would involve lifting King and several of his pawns off chessboard. Cox.(64.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 577.)

Suggestion that Feisal should come home was yours not ours. There can be no question of giving him the under-taking he seeks as a condition. Treaty also was Feisal&apos;s suggestion not ours. It is for him to suggest methods of escaping from deadlock he has created. Meanwhile, I agree that in view of his attitude the general question of putting to the Iraq Assembly issue of our remaining in Iraq must be submitted to Cabinet, which will resume its meetings early in September.

Churchill.; (67.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 593.) August 23, 1922.Following for your information :  As already reported one of the recent demands of the extremist manifestos and newspapers has been dismissal of the present Cabinet on the grounds, firstly, that they have accepted the Treaty, and secondly, that they have no clear policy. Meaning of latter accusation is that as a whole Cabinet is moderate and not extremist and that extremists realise that as long as Naqib remains in power they cannot hope to control the coming elections and provincial appointments.Simultaneously and probably in co-operation with above movement Feisal has been recently complaining to me that the Ministers were no use to him and that he was tired of the Naqib&apos;s regime and would like to oust him. I urged upon him very strongly that until the Treaty was concluded it was most, important that Naqib and his Cabinet should, remain, and reminded him that in getting rid of Naqib now he was playing into the hands of extremists. Feisal outwardly deferred to my view, but forthwith began to behave in such a way towards the Cabinet that a few days ago at a Cabinet Council it was resolved that the Prime Minister should wrrite to the King and express the hope that at this difficult juncture they might rely upon his support and co-operation. Feisal sent an ambiguous reply which was taken by the Cabinet to be a refusal of support, and all Ministers but one asked the Prime Minister to accept their resignations. Prime Minister refused until he had asked the King if his words were really intended to mean that the Cabinet did not possess his confidence. I then intervened and urged the King to reply that he had. not meant any want of confidence and approved of Naqib&apos;s not accepting the resignations : he hoped that they would continue to function, but would be glad to confer with a &apos;Committee of them in order to frame more definite lines of policy on which to work. He gave me to understand that he Avould proceed on. these lines, but failed to do so, and later argued that as most of Naqib&apos;s Ministers had resigned it was necessary from the constitutional standpoint that the Naqib should resign too, but that in accepting his resignation he would in the same communication ask him to form a new Cabinet.   Having induced Naqib to resign on solemn assurance to above effect
he has now shifted his ground again and having accepted resignation asks Naqib to answer a number of questions as to the policy he proposes to pursue in various connections.Meanwhile Naqib&apos;s resignation is nublished, and Feisal has successfully played extremists&apos; game and at the present moment there is no Cabinet. I shall do my utmost to secure that the Naqib returns to office, but I suspect that he hopes to trap Naqib into some declaration of pro-treaty or pro-British policy which will enable Feisal to say that public clamour prevents him from reappointing Naqib as he had hoped. If the Naqib finally goes I doubt if any acceptable individual could be induced to form a Cabinet under existing conditions. All the good men are disgusted with FeisaFs vagaries.- Cox.(88.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 594.) August 23, 1922.On 21st August I received a personal letter from Feisal saying that he had several times in the past pressed for the pursuit of a clearer line of policy and the fixation of responsibility in regard to internal administration. Owing to the delay in the conclusion of the Treaty which would define the status of the country the internal situation had reached a stage which gave grave cause for anxiety.Accordingly in order to free himself from liability to His Majesty&apos;s Government and to the British personnel, whose lives he was in honour bound to safeguard, he felt constrained to ask me to inform His Majesty&apos;s Government that should any outbreak fraught with serious risks result from the present situation [ ? group corrupt] either that I as British representative should assume full responsibility for maintenance of security or that responsibility should be left with him and he should be given a free hand to direct affairs as he might deem best. He asked me to make a reference and obtain a definite reply as soon as possible (ends).That the King should be given a free hand to manage the affairs of the country is one of the demands in all the recent manifestos. It simply means that as long as the High Commissioner can exercise any check on what goes on, the King and extremists cannot sweep the board, and meanwhile the moderate elements are ccn-consolidating and becoming daily stronger. Rightly or wrongly I regard FeisaFs letter as pure bluff, and following is summary of my reply :  (Begins): It is not clear to me whether the policy which he wants to be mure clearly defined is the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government or the policy of the Govern-ment of Iraq, but no doubt latter hangs on former. Policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government is that in view of progress made in Iraq since the armistice they have felt justified in interpreting the Mandate by a Treaty with Iraq while retaining their responsibility to the League of Nations. Agreement had now been reached as regards details of Treaty, but signature was delayed owing to the inability of His-Majesty&apos;s Government to comply with the King&apos;s wishes that the Mandate should be abrogated. His Majesty&apos;s Government have been asked to take a final decision and make a final and public offer to Iraq, but that British Cabinet would not meet-before early in September and it was our duty to await their decision patiently.As to the question of responsibility, as I have informed him before there is no doubt about it. Pending conclusion of Treaty which will no doubt modify question responsibility is a joint one shared between the Government of Iraq, of which His Majesty is the head, and myself as British representative. There can be no question of his divesting himself of his share or I of mine and I see no necessity to refer it to His Majesty&apos;s Government. It is for his Government and me to devise measures in concert to meet the necessities of the situation. I agree with him that it is disquieting, but am constrained to tell him as I have already told him verbally that the persons principally responsible for the unrest are individuals who enjoy his sympathy and support, and only a clear indication from him is needed to stop it all. I continued that in my opinion a grave personal responsibility devolves upon himself for the present situation. In any case the proper course is for the Government of Iraq to confer with me as to steps to be taken, and if advice was neglected I was prepared in consultation with General Officer Commanding to take such action as might be necessary, but I was very loath to do that and warned His Majesty that if it became-
necessary the responsibility for it and consequences thereof would rest on his shoulders.    (End of summary.)As there is no Government at the moment I have arranged for regular aerial patrols and think that will suffice. Cox.(69.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 597.   Confidential.) August 25, 1922.Following for your information :  August 23, being anniversary of FeisaFs accession, was observed as a holiday and King had official reception at the Serai. I attended with my staff punctually at hour fixed for my visit. On entering the Serai yard I found crowd of some hundred people collected round the King&apos;s building. They made way for my cars and as I got to the steps noticed that the crowd was apparently listening to someone speaking from among a knot of Arab gentlemen standing in the back balcony of the King&apos;s reception rooms As I passed the threshold the crowd applauded some remark made by someone in the crowd which we did not hear. On my departure a few minutes later the crowd had dispersed and I then caused enquiries to be made as to what they had been doing. I found that just before he received me the King had received the extremist political party and wT.hen they left his presence they adjourned to the back verandah overlooking the square, where one of their number, a blind demagogue and agitator, Saiyidmehdi alal Basir al Hilli, addressed to the crowd a speech directed against British policy and British Colonial [ ? Governments]. Remark which called forth the clapping was a shout by one of the [ ?] &quot; Down with the Mandate!&quot; On receiving this report I at once wrote a vehement protest to Feisal demanding immediate apology for the gross affront to His Majesty&apos;s representative and the instant dismissal of the King&apos;s Chamberlain Fehmi al Mudarris who directed or permitted the demagogue to make his speech and stood beside him while he was making it. I asked also for a list of the King&apos;s household for scrutiny. Feisal has taken to his bed to-day ostensibly with a. severe, pain in his stomach, but I have received a frank apology and acceptance of my demands.I do not think Feisal can have been privy to the incident, but there can be no doubt that it was carefully arranged by members of his staff. I shall now discuss with the King action to be taken against other individuals concerned.(70.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 598.) August 25, 1922.My telegram immediately before. FeisaFs indisposition proves to be return of appendicitis symptoms.He is to be operated on to-day, 25th August.(71.)Telegram from the High Commissioner of Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 604.) August 26, 1922.FeisaFs attack of appendicitis recurred on the 24th. An operation was performed 25th August. Perforation of appendix with commencing abscess formation discovered. Appendix was removed. King stood the operation well, and although his condition is somewhat serious he is progressing as [ ?] as can be expected. Cox.
(72.)Telegram from the High Commissioner of Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 605.) August 26. 1922.My telegram 24th August, No. 597, last sentence. With consent of King&apos;s medical adviser, Cornwallis and I visited him early this morning 25th two hours before the operation. We explained, to him that we appeared, to me to have reached parting of ways. By the speech made from veranda of his rooms at moment of my visit he had become personally identified with and responsible for anti-British vapourings of the extreme nationalist party, which had now been repeated to two of local papers. He must now in my opinion either publicly disassociate himself from these agitators and definitely come in with us or take consequences, which as far as we could see might be end of his Kingship. I had accordingly now come to inform him that after consultation with Cornwallis and Inspector-General of Police, seditious activities of his party had now passed all bounds, and that if prompt action was not taken it would not be possible to maintain public ceace. We asked him in the absence of any Cabinet to order the arrest of seven ringleaders, including demagogue who read harangue from his balcony. We spent hour endeavouring to convince him that this was his opportunity to save himself and get out. of hands of these agitators, but I am sorry to say that we failed to induce him to do&apos; so.His argument was that in his opinion such, action, would produce revolution and not stop one, and he could not take responsibility on his shoulders. Personally T am convinced that he is so tied up with these extremists and obsessed by their overrated power that he simply is afraid to round on them.With the Government non-existent at the moment and King on sick list and unwilling to act I felt it necessary to take action myself. Accordingly arrangements were made for carrying out arrests this morning. Four most important were bagged and are being sent to Basrah to military custody. Four others less important went to earth and have not yet been dug out. Extremist party has been temporarily suppressed and its office closed, and two papers which published material have also been suppressed and the editors arrested or are about to be. City is quiet and the police have not found it necessary to ask for military assistance. I trust that this action will result in maintenance of stability pending final decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government. ,This evening 26th August I am issuing announcement to the Iraq public. I begin by explaining how it is that owing to Parliament not being in session and Cabinet Ministers being in recess His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot make their final announce-ment or offer until early in September. It is accordingly duty of all to await their decision patiently. Pending conclusion of treaty responsibility of maintenance of order is a joint one between the Government of Iraq and the High Commissioner. Unfortunately no Cabinet is functioning.at present and the Kinc has suddenly been incapacitated by serious illness. High Commissioner had accordingly taken respon-sibility which, he cannot take himself for action necessary to maintain security, and has decided upon following steps, &amp;c. Action taken meant no change of policy, but all law-abiding persons who have interests of country at heart and are anxious to preserve friendly relations with Great Britain are called upon to stand together to maintain order and to prevent irresponsible agitators from disturbing &quot;peace or the happy relations between the two countries.  (Ends.)It is possible that two of Ulema in Kadhimain may give trouble, but I am hopeful action taken will have desired effect on them.(73.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(Secret and Personal.) August 24, 1922.I realise that success or failure of Feisal as King of Iraq and of our policy involved therewith is a matter of much more than local import, and that collapse of project in pursuance of which we brought him here, besides being humiliating to us vis-a-vis France, would probably involve recasting of our Arabian policy as a whole.
, ... At the same time, I think that I should acquaint you personally with the disappointing conclusions which I have been brought to as a result of a year associa-tion with Feisal.Never having met him before, I accepted him when he came as the desirable person which your advisers portrayed. I have endeavoured to work with him in all sincerity and straightforwardness, but by degrees I have been completely disillusioned. He has charm of manner in ordinary human intercourse and is a kind and unaffected host, but apart from that he does not appear to me to possess any of necessary qualities to make a good. King. Fie is morally weak and unstable; he readily gives his word and as readily evades fulfilment of it. He is a subtle and accomplished schemer and a very bad judge of men. I do not believe he has the least idea of acting as a constitutional monarch, but with help of his [ ?] aspires rather to be an irresponsible:autocrat.In administration areas which have been immune from insidious meddling of Feisal and his suite, such as Basra, Amarah and Kut, administration has proceeded during the past year quite smoothly and with complete good-will and co-operation between British and Arab officials. On the contrary, in the Hillah and Nasiriyah divisions, which, being nearer home and more fruitful soil for politics, have been his special field of interest, his bad selection of Arab officials and injudicious meddling have had their inevitable result.Chauvinist officials, in direct communication with the Palace and taking the cue from [?] instead of from the Ministry of Interior, have acted behind the backs of their advisers and neglected their proper duties in order to indulge in propaganda and party politics. Result is that payment of revenue has ceased, and the acutest animosity prevails among sections of the communities. Extremists, encouraged by support of the King and of the provincial official selected by him, are rampant, while the moderate elements are sullen and resentful of restraint put upon them by the British advisers and myself.Again, Feisal readily listens to backbiters and quickly develops personal animosity against any British adviser or official whom his extremist adherents vilify merely because his personal influence is too strong.   Thus, he refused to have Nalderback; lie did his best to bring about the removal of--- s, and he will undoubtedlynot retain Dickson, simply because they have held their own and done their duty fearlessly- Cornwallis has worked patiently and devotedly, but scales have gradually fallen from his eyes, and he informs me that his association with Feisal in Syria gave him no conception of the qualities which he has displayed here, especially his lack of judgment.In Baghdad he is regarded with profound mistrust by the Naqib and Sassoon and others of that calibre, while in the country he is looked upon with contempt and resentment by all solid and moderate men, and in my intercourse with the latter I now continually feel ashamed when asked why we inflicted on them such a paltry character as King. He has certainly not made good, and very much doubt if he ever will.I quite recognise that, having put up Feisal and Iraq having accepted him, it may not be possible for us or worth the candle to contemplate any change and that Feisal and Iraq must take their chance; but, as the Cabinet will not meet for a fortnight or more, I have thought- it desirable to inform you personally of my own conclusions.   Please treat them as you think best. Cox.(74.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 607.) August 27, 1922.According to this morning5s report action reported in my cypher telegram No. 605 and announcement issued in the evening have had an excellent effect, and have been received by the best people with feelings of relief.Meanwhile, Feisal is convalescing quickly from his operation and in a few days visitors will be allowed to see him. His political position and future are necessarily affected by my independent action, and before Cornwallis or I discuss the situation with him we must decide on line which we propose to take. On the one hand, it is obvious that if he dissociates himself from the action which I have taken, either he or I must retire from the stage.   On the other hand, if he publicly endorses my actionT8804] -   - -    P    -
and comes into the open on the side of the moderates, such action would in theory put him right with us. As yet, as far as I am concerned, none but the senior British officers whom it was necessary to take into confidence are aware of his refusal to agree to steps proposed to him, and in my public announcement I merely referred to His Majesty&apos;s inability, owing to sickness, to take his share in the direction of affairs. If removal of medical embargo against his receiving visitors obliges us to .interview him before I have received any indication of the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government, I propose to speak to him as follows : (Begins) : The public are not awrare of his refusal to co-operate with me. If he now refuses to publicly endorse my action, either he or I must retire. He noAv has a last opportunity to change his attitude and come out into the open on our side by making a public announcement that he entirely approves and endorses the steps taken by me as High Commissioner to maintain order during his illness, and [ ?] I have said in my public announcement yesterday. He calls upon the people to realise that the hopes and salvation of Iraq [?1 independent State depend entirely on the mainten-ance of close friendship with Great Britain; that they must realise that Great Britain is prepared to give them all that she can without prejudice to her international obligations and responsibilities, and that he and the Cabinet which is about to form will devote their utmost efforts to find a happ)^ solution, and that meanwhile people must remain calm and patient.   (Message ends.)It is believed that any announcement by him now while extremists are at discount would rally almost the whole community on to moderate lines, provided that the King also changes his tactics in certain other directions. For example, we should demand the clearance of the objectionable portion of his entourage, and in this connection we are of opinion that the selection of the principal members of his secretariat and household should rest with Government of Iraq. He should also be required to give written assurances that he will abstain from interference in regard to appointments and other details of internal administration which it is not the business of a constitutional monarch to meddle with. Also I should personally insist that he should be guided by my advice in selection of new&quot; Cabinet.Although I think we must recognise that in. Feisal we have a very unstable character, yet his sudden illness has given us the opportunity of repatching situation for him in spite of himself, and if he takes warning and really comes over, we may still make something of him. In the alternative involved, by his abdication or resignation I find it very difficult to see the daylight. Cox(75.)Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissionerfor Iraq.(Personal.) August 28, 1922.Your telegram No. 598. I have drafted a whole series of telegrams dealing with the situation, but in view of fact that Feisal is now on sick list I content myself with a cordial expression of approval of your action. It seems important to take advan-tage of FeisaFs condition to secure reinstatement of a Ministry under the Naqib of a pronouncedly moderate character. Pet me know what you propose to do.  Churchill.(76.)Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissionerfor Iraq.(Personal.) &apos; August 28, 1922.Your telegram No. 605. Your action is approved. As it turned out, the Cabinet has quite unexpectedly been brought together to discuss reparations and unemployment, and I could have brought Iraq issue before it. But in view of Feisal&apos;s appendicitis, I think it better to wait for a meeting in September. Meanwhile, I will send you a long telegram on whole situation, to which I should like to have your reply before I place issue before Cabinet.In principle, my suggestion is to take advantage of present situation to reduce Feisal to a strictly limited and constitutional role and to establish the Naqib and Ministry in a position of far greater strength than they have hitherto occupied.  Churchill. &quot;.
Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissionerfor Iraq.August 28, 1922.I showed Cabinet your telegram No. 607 and preceding telegrams to-day. They entirely approved language you propose to hold to Feisal and action you have taken. I will telegraph further to you to-morrow. Cabinet expressed great confidence in your judgment and in skill and firmness with which you are handling a difficult situation.   Do not get entangled in Kurdistan. Churchill.(78.)Tcleg:rain from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 608.)(Private.) August 28, 1922.As Feisal&apos;s political future is hanging in the balance, it is more fair to him and satisfactory to myself that I should inform you in Cornwallis&apos;s own words of the attitude which the latter has been brought to in regard to His Majesty by the experience of the last few months.   He expresses himself as follows : &apos;&apos; I originally came here almost entirely because of my personal affection for Feisal. I knew that he had the highest ideals about the future of the Arabs, and i was convinced that he believed that their future was dependent on friendship with us. I have no doubt that at heart lie feels the same to-day, but he has lost himself in a maze of intrigues and has failed to act up to his principles. The long delay in reaching finality on the question of the mandate and the treaty has no doubt contributed to this, but his character is, I think, more to blame than anything. He has allowed himself to be surrounded by a number of extremists who have only their own interests at heart, and he has readily imbibed all their lies until he is firmly convinced that a majority in the country is with them. In administrative matters he has been, most tiresome, continually interfering with appointments and other matters, and. making my position very difficult. He has chafed against any restraint, and T am sure has been continually egged on by his staff to assert himself to a point of sometimes refusing sincere advice given by the High Commisisoner. I have lost no opportunity of remonstrating with him. In fact, our meetings during the last four months have been, one long series of criticism and chidings on my part, and had we not been genuinely fond of each other we would have reached breaking-point long since. I fear I must confess failure in my attempt to keep him within bounds. I think that his nature is too   Tl for anyone to be able to succeed in that.&quot; But though weak and misguided, I am certain that he is as desirous of our friendship and a treaty with us as the day he came. My opinion is that he must be saved from himself and his so-called friends, and that now, after what has passed, we have an opportunity, by insisting on changes in his entourage, by making him come-in to the open on the side of moderation and submit to certain constitutional shackles, greatly to alter his point of view and improve the situation. On the other hand, I think that an almost hopeless situation would be created if we try to get rid of him. We can only recognise with regret that he has been a disappointment and try to improve him, if necessary in spite of himself. Although I have criticised him fully in the foregoing, 1 should like to make it clear my affection for him is unchanged, and that I believe that his shortcomings are due to weakness of character and faulty judgment, and not to any innate badness.&quot; Cox.(79.)Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissionerfor Iraq.(No. 492.   Private and Personal.) August 29, 1922.My telegram of yesterday. I entirely agree that Feisal should be given another chance&apos;on the lines you suggest, but I am inclined to think you should go a little further to force his hand.  I presume you will be able without difficulty to keep him[8804] f 2
entirely out of action on medical grounds until after Cabinet decision has been communicated to you next week. Meanwhile, you have a free hand. I suggest that as first step you should induce Naqib to form Moderate Government ostensibly to carry on routine work of administration, subject to King&apos;s subsequent approval. I am prepared to recommend to Cabinet that Treaty should be published forthwith, and steps taken to convene Constituent Assembly to decide whether it should be accepted as it stands. It could be pointed out that Article 6 affords constitutional method for escape from Mandate, since admission of Iraq to Membership of League will automatically &quot;terminate Mandatory relation. We are not bound to support application until Treaty is signed and Article 6 comes into effect. Nor has applica-tion any chance of success until Constitution has been established under Article 3. Recent resolution of League prevents admission of new Member unless frontiers are defined. This being so, I personally see no reason why we should not undertake to support application as soon as Treaty and subsidiary agreements have been ratified, Organic Law passed, and frontiers defined. We cannot be expected to move faster than this. It appears to me that there can be little doubt of success if issue is stated by you or by Naqib on these lines. If this is so, could we not proceed with or without FeisaFs consent while he is still out of action? He would then have to face alterna-tives of supporting you and Naqib in all action taken or being deposed. It should, I think, be made clear to him that we will not allow our whole policy to be wrecked by his obstinacy. Nor should he suppose that he will be allowed freely to retire to the Hedjaz. We have not brought him to Iraq to play the autocrat, but to settle down into a sober constitutional monarch, friendly to us. Let me have your views to lay before the Cabinet. If we decide to go on with the elections, the Naqib&apos;s Government would, of course, instruct all Arab and British officials to use their influence as far as is proper to secure acceptance of the Treaty.(80.)Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissionerfor Iraq.(Personal and Secret.) August 30, 1922.Everything turns on FeisaFs answer to your forthcoming communication. If he submits or acquiesces and identifies himself with you, you should if possible tele-graph home the form of the various announcements that would be necessary. If he refuses, there should also be time for reference home, and in this case I shall be glad if you will indicate what course you recommend. You will, I presume, point out to him that a final breach with him Avill very likely involve a complete change in our Arabian policy.. At the present time we are with great difficulty and at considerable expense holding Ibn Saud back from attacking the ITedjaz. If we distinterest ourselves in these regions, as well we may. Feisal will have accomplished his own downfall for the second time and also the ruin of his house.(81.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 611.) August 30, 1922.My telegram No. 604 of 26th August. I understand that when his operation was imminent Feisal telegraphed for his brother Zaid. Operation was completely successful and Feisal is out of danger so that need on that account has passed, but I understand that Feisal still desires his brother to come. If he comes, please let me know by what ship and what are his ports of call so that I can ask for facilities. Addressed Jeddah.  Repeated to Colonial Office. Cox.
37 (82.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 612.   Private and Personal.) August 31, 1922.Your telegram No. 492 and connected messages. I am much fortified by your support and the knowledge that action taken meets with your approval.The two divines referred to in my telegram No. 605 accepted a hint from me and migrated to Persia 28th August. Result of action has been excellent everywhere and (except in Kurdistan) general situation is quite satisfactory.As regards your present proposals. Recommendations which you contemplate making to the Cabinet, namely, the publication of the treaty, convening of the Constituent Assembly, explanation of [?] membership of the League of Nations coupled- with the reservation regarding the conclusion of subsidiary agreements, establishment of constitution and delimitation of the frontiers seem to me to meet the case and I have no doubt that they will satisfy Iraq public.Your suggestions as to reinstatement of Ministry, are, however, beyond the practical possibilities here. Although the British Medical Officers in attendance on Peisal are professionally requiring that His Majesty should not be allowed to do serious official business before the end of next week, yet Feisal is quite wrell mentally and out of all physical danger and is already receiving numbers of his private friends, who are taken into him by the private physician. I had already some days ago asked the Naqib if he would accept a call from me to resume his duties with such members of his Cabinet as he could induce to return, but he did not like the idea. T have again put it to him from the point of view indicated in your telegram, but he argues that the state of the King&apos;s health is so good as to deprive us of adequate excuse for such action and that the arrangement would have the appearance of flouting King and would prejudice his future usefulness by putting the King permanently against him. There is force in what he says and I do not feel able to press the proposal. Another consideration is that Cornwallis, pending the appoint-ment, of a new Cabinet, is able to do a good deal on his own initiative in the direction of clearing out unsuitable employees in the interior, and the longer he remains without a Minister the better from his point of view. T think, therefore, that we must depend on what we can get from. Feisal. himself. I can without difficulty avoid. discussion with him until I receive decision of Cabinet next week. But Cornwallis daily finds it more difficult to abstain from visiting him and cannot avoid it any longer. If he does we fear that Feisal may be got at again. Feisal wall certainly broach to Cornwallis subject of events which have taken place since our interview with him on 25th August. In reply Cornwallis will inform him that you had entirely approved of my action in the circumstances and are awaiting a meeting of the Cabinet next week to talk out the whole situation and announce the views of His Majesty&apos;s government-ment to him both as regards the Treaty and the Mandate and recent events. So far as the Mandate question is conce7-ned Cornwallis would say that indications of a solution seem hopeful. He would add that the High Commissioner daily asked after His Majesty and now sent kind enquiries, but would prefer not to discuss any-business with him until the doctors announce him officially off the sick list and until the final views of His Majesty&apos;s Government are received. Should Feisal broach with Cornwallis the question, of the reformation of Cabinet, the latter will reply on my behalf that if the King is prepared without further argument to ask Naqib and those of his colleagues who will rejoin him to resume their portfolios temporarily pending his complete convalescence well and good. Otherwise High Commissioner requests he will defer all action in the direction of the formation of a new Cabinet until the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government have been received and communicated to His Majesty.T clo not know if you have any special views as to the conditions to be imposed upon Feisal Avith a vieAv to curbing his autocratic instincts and placing the Cabinet in a stronger position. Will you kindly make any suggestions that occur to you? Meanwhile I will endeavour to formulate same in consultation with parties here.As regards the penultimate paragraph of your telegram I think that the initial sine qua non to Feisal being given another chance must be that he should endorse action taken during his illness and agree to accept and support the very reasonable solution Avhich you have now devised. In the event of his refusing to come in I will of.course refer to you before taking further action. Cox.
(84.)Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissioner.for Iraq.(No. 503.) September 2, 1922.There are two separate issues. First, the personal issue with Feisal. Second, the mandate difficulty.So far as Feisal is concerned, I am of opinion that you should at the earliest moment demand from him : (1) The endorsement of the action taken during his illness. (2) That he will undertake to consult the High Commissioner and to act upon his advice in the formation of his Cabinet and the selection of individual Ministers. (3) That he will make no appointments in any Department or to his own household except through the Ministry concerned. In view of the financial situation disclosed in News Summary of 18th August, you should also demand (4) that he will agree to the immediate appointment of a Settlement Commission to investigate revenue conditions on the Euphrates. The recommendations of this commission, which should, I think, be presided over by a British officer, must be accepted. (5) That he must appoint a similar commission to investigate expenditure upon military and police services, with a view to ensuring that Iraq is doing its full share in a really economical manner and within the limits of its own resources towards the preservation of order in the country. (6) That he must immediately dismiss those officials in the Euphrates area whose activities have been directed in such a way as to canse disaffection among the tribes and the falling off of revenue.The whole of this issue should, in my opinion, be put plainly to the King in order that his answer and action in regard to it may be before the Cabinet at the time of their taking the general decisions which may be required. Tell him that his answer to these demands will be laid before the Cabinet.On the second issue you may say that you have little doubt that if the Cabinet were reassured by satisfactory answers from Feisal on the points above mentioned, they would assent to proposals about the treaty, the mandate, &amp;c, on the lines of. my telegram No. 492. But he can expect no promise of any kind until he has satisfied them on the above points, and he will of course realise that His Majesty&apos;s Government can in no case undertake that the League will accept their recommendation. If, on the other hand, FeisaFs answer was unsatisfactory, I think the Cabinet should be free either to remove Feisal or to throw the whole burden upon him and quit the country forthwith, availing themselves of the wish expressed in so many quarters in Iraq that the King should have a free hand to rule the country,, and of his own evident wish to undertake plenary responsibility.Meanwhile, it seems to me important that you should see Feisal at the earliest moment. Is there not the danger of his falling under bad influences in the absence of you and Cornwallis. and is there not a further clanger of his taking some action contrary to your policy which will definitely commit him ?

September 3, 1922.M.y telegram of the 2nd September, No. 503.I am much concerned to learn that there may he difficulties in the repayment-by Iraq of the 30 lakhs overpaid in respect of the period up to 31st March, 1922. I need scarcely tell you that a supplementary estimate of this kind for purposes entirely outside any parliamentary approval would be a very serious matter indeed. It is perfectly clear that this money must be repaid by Iraq, profitless or undueTelegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.August 31, 1922,.My telegram No. 612 was under despatch when [ ? your] secret and personal telegram of 30th August reached me.

expenditure on the Arab army and King feisal&apos;s Court being cut down to the point necessary. Mr. Vernon, our financial adviser, also warns me that there will be a further civil deficit this year on Iraq accounts, as the Government is overspending its revenue from day to day. I am afraid I cannot see my way to finding any additional sums from British sources in any circumstances whatever to relieve this deficit. Colonel Slater considers that the main cause of the failure of revenue on the Euphrates is the incompetent Arab officials jobbed in by Feisal, If this is so, it seems to me that as a part of your forthcoming announcement to the King, this financial situation should be bluntly presented.Please let me have your latest figures of revenue and expenditure as soon as possible. I sympathise very much with you in these gathering difficulties with which you are contending, and am very sorry to add to them, Churchill.(86.) &apos;Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of Slate forthe Colonies.(No. 622.) September 6, 1922.Your telegram of 2nd September, No. 503. As 1 may use material in your telegram No. 492 to the extent you now indicate, there is no difficulty in modifying programme as you suggest.Position as regards Feisal is that he and his household would have one believe that Feisal as yet [ ?] knows nothing of action taken since his illness. He has altogether eschewed politics when visited by Cornwallis and Miss Bell except to say to the former that he had not felt himself at our last meeting; that he feared that he had behaved foolishly, incurring High Commissioners anger. The portents therefore seem good. Yesterday, I asked, his secretary to let him know that I would like to see him as soon as possible, and Cornwallis at his visit to-day, 6th September, will tell him what has passed during his illness: the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government and. the [ ?] necessity for him to endorse [ ?] my action, &amp;c. I hope then to see him.   Meanwhile, I submit some preliminary observations on your suggestions.(1) and (2). I agree. (3.) I agree as regards Departments, but as regards his own household, it is proposed that posts &quot;Head of Diwan&quot; [ ?] and Chamberlain [ V\ should be Government posts and the present incumbents changed. As regards small appointments, I shall ask for dismissal of certain individuals and reconstruction of his household, but it is hardly possible to demand that they should all be subject to the approval of Government as rule.(4) and. (6). The three chief offenders have already been withdrawn [ ?] and an enquiry made hy a specially selected British officer into revenue collection on Euphrates with result that our allegations;- are fully substantiated and chief offender will, either be criminally prosecuted or dismissed the service. Subordinate offenders also have been or are being dismissed or transferred. What is wanted is a thorough investigation by a senior and expert officer, with a view to settlement of agrarian question in Nasiriyah division and. examination of working of the present system of revenue administration in general.(5.) Both military and police expenditure has just been [ ?] investigated by the Economies Committee and substantial economies made in their respective budgets. Slater&apos;s proposal that all local organisations should, be amalgamated into a gendarmerie has already been gone into some months ago and was rejected as unsound and impracticable, but we will explore field again. Meanwhile, my primd facie view is that solution is either conscription or reduction of total strength agreed to at the Cairo Conference and consequent increase in risks taken, but I will communicate separately on this subject.As regards rest of your telegram, I will be guided hy your instructions. At the first interview with Feisal I should endeavour to arrange his endorsement of my action, and if he agrees, say that in those circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to give him another opportunity, and it is hoped that he will agree to proceed on the basis of your personal proposals as regards [ ?&apos;] mandate and the [ ? ] treaty. But in order to guard against a repetition of recent events and for his own protection, we require him to agree to regulate his personal conduct on certain approved lines which will now be formulated in consultation with you and presented to him.(You will realise that negotiations are likely to be complicated by recent events in Kurdistan).

(87.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(No. 627.) September 7, 1922.Following for your ad interim information :Cornwallis saw Feisal yesterday, and with my permission informed him of all action taken, and, in general terms, that if his attitude was satisfactory, reply re-treaty and mandate were likely to be helpful, but that he would have to submit to certain restrictions or safeguards on his future conduct as King.Feisal replied he would Have no difficulty in endorsing my action, and that in principle he was prepared to accept reasonable safeguards for his conduct provided that they did not destroy his &quot; sharaf &quot; (prestige).Naqib expresses the opinion that in so far as Iraq proper is concerned, he considers position of Central Government is stronger to-day and the situation in the provinces more satisfactory than it has been at any time since the installation of national government, and that a favourable reply from His Majesty&apos;s Government to the mandate and treatv would meet with cordial response from the whole country. -Cox.o
