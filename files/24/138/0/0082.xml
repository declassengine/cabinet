THE C0MMTO?I8Tb&apos;&apos; - &apos;-The manner in which the Communist Prrty obeys Moscow*ainstructions is well illustrated in an extract from theofficial minutes of the meeting of the sub-Executive ofthe Party which was held on August 25th:;&quot;In ^letter from the Comintern enclosing an appeal to the workers of England in connection with&apos;  the American Coal strike, and asking for publicity to be given to it, with special endeavours to get It .    inserted in the 1 Daily- Herald&apos;, secretary (Inkpin)reported that he had sent&apos;&apos;the appeal to *She Comunist&quot; 1 The worker&apos; and the &quot;Dally Herald&apos;.    Reply had also been sent to the Comintern pointing out that efforts had been made in recent issues of &quot;The Communist&apos; to secure affective positive action by the British Workers in support of the American miners, also.. mentioning that, it was becoming more ana more difficult to secure publicity for&quot; Communist, declarations in the . &quot;D^ily Herald&quot;.    Secretaryrs action was endorsed.   A further letter was also received,from the Comintern stating that comrade;&apos;Rw.de2c had been authorised to write a pamphlet on the significance and development of the Labour Party, and asking for a detailed report of the p.:.rty anc. its activity since the Edinburgh Conference of the Labour Party.

The other Question of importance is unemployment and here we snail insist upon,the demands of the Unemployed Committee receiving the fullest support.&quot;  -In this connection it is not without interest to note that the following leaflet, which bears the imprint of aman who does most of the printing for the Communist.

Long, Printer,  (T.U.) 104, Dawes Rd., Fulham, S.W.6.On August 24th George Deacon and Ernest Cant held an examination for the members of the Central Training Group and extracts from their report show the linesr on which they worked:-&quot;Before /
- a -&quot;BexQre eatering into details of the Exam we wish to make known one or two considerations which have influenced our decisions.    The first involves the purpose for which the Central Training Group,was established.     This we understand to be for the Training of Trainers or Group headers for future Party Training Groups.   We felt then that the position of a Trainer or Leader of a Training Group was a very important one, and that certificates of qualification for this work should not be issued indiscriminately...&quot;Bearing this in mind, therefore, we had preliminary conversation on the form which the examination should take, and we decided that it should embrace at least three methods of judging - first by verbal exam to be judged in the light of concept embodied in reply and degree of expression;    second by a written exam which would afford a greater scope for displaying detailed grasp of subject;    thirdly by each member of the Group conducting another group with a view to ascertaining his general adaptability for the work of leading.&quot;The following questions we put for verbal examination:-I. How many working class parties are there?2.     Bo we want immediate demands in our programme?3.     If someone were to say to you that Communism was a Dream, how would you answer?4.     What happens when production gets larger under Capitalism?5.     What is the use of the State to Capitalism?-6.     What is our task towards the Capitalist State?8.     How does Communism differ from the old Ideal States that used to be put forward?9.     How would we distribute under Communism?10.   Why is the Dictatorship of the Proletariat necessary?II. What is the difference between Scientific and Utopian Socialism?12.    Is the Labour Party a Y/orking Class Party?13.   What is its value to the working class movement?14. What is our object in taking part in the Trade Union Work?15. What is the importance of the Workshop?16. What is the importance of Working in Parliament?17. Why did the Second International break down?18. What is meant by the &quot;United Front&quot;?19. What do we mean by a Mass Party?- 20 /
20.   Are there limitations to the use of local bodies to the Communist party?21.   We talk abou.t Capitalism and Imperialism.   What ^ Imperialism?The following have b&amp;nn set for written reply:-1.     What can a Communist do on a Board of Guardians?2.     What will he the functions of the Industrial Unions when the Working Class have captured Political and Economic power?3. .   Why must Capitalism break down?&quot;Of the students who were examined Casey, Hill, Eines, HO^tr, Springhall &quot;passed well&quot;; Taylor &quot;passed&quot;; Lambe was &quot;uncertain&quot; -and Anning. was &quot;not suitable for leader&quot;.Mary Moorhouse, the secretary of the London ThesesCommittee, and Ernest Cant, Divisional organiser, have sent the following communication to certain&apos; London Communists&quot;Communist Party of Great Britain, London Divisional Council Theses Committee.&quot;Dear Comrade,&quot;Under the instructions of the Party Sub-executive and of the London Divisional Executive a &quot;meeting of Comrades from the Barking, Bow, East Ham, N.W. Ham, S.W. Hem, pop]ar and IIford branches was called by the Theses Committee on August 12th.    Tho changes in organisation, entailed by the org-arisation Theses were explained and a scheme for initiating these changes in the area- covered by tha above branches was discussed and approved by the meeting.   The work of gathering information as to always members in the area was undertaken by the Comrades present, and it was agreed that the Theses committee should &quot;report to a further special meeting (to be held on Saturday September 2nd) as a preliminary to an agregate meeting of the members of the area.&quot;The agenda of this special meeting is enclosed.., You are particularly requested to attend.&quot;Agenda1.

The Edinburgh branch does not agree that &quot;it is henceforward the duty of members of the Communist Party to apply for membership of the individual section of their respective Labour Parties&quot;.     The Edinburgh Branch considers that the Sub-Executive Committee before such decisive instructions upon problematical or disputable questions,  should first take sounding of the branches, decisions being arrived at by conference on rexereudum:    the branches being bound by them.&quot;In the present case the Party has not been given the opportunity to decide for or against.    This being so, the Edinburgh Branch is not prepared to abide by your latest instructions, being convinced that your instructions would not be endorsed by the Communist Party of Great Britain.    It is the expression of the Gntire membership that counts.upon this cuestion, not the expression of a fey/ individuals in committee who seemingly are unaware of the ferment they are causing within the Party by adopting an attitude of conciliation and compromise towards the Labour Party for reasons which only they themselves know.&apos;&quot;In rejecting your instructions, the Edinburgh Branch has taken a serious step.   This is recognised by the Branch.&quot;Tha seoomfrom the Sprlngburn branch, also bearsquotation:-
K I a&quot;I append a copy ot a letter reoeived from ;Secretary of the Bridgeton Branch:!At a special meeting our branch unanimously rejected the recommendations of the E.C. on the grounds that the rank end.file, got no opportunity to propers themselves for or against the surrender to the Labour Party .    We claim that^ now is the time to fight.    Do .,ou agree with us? If so let us knew as soon as possible what position your Branch is taking up on this matter.1&apos;iours EratV, .W. McICean.&quot;In laying the above before the Central Branch after a short discussion I v?e&amp;--instructed to forward this copy to you. for the consideration of Central Committee of the Scottish District and at the same time to draw their attention to the vmoonstitu.tion.al method of the Bridgeton Branch in. submit ting &quot;the same to the Branches,    it being the opinion of the Central Branch that same should have been submitted first to the H.E.C. and from that source to the Branches.&quot;The Sub-Executive of the Communist Party has decided that &quot;Since the members of the Bridgeton Branch have voted for their own expulsion from the Part;;, we take st^ps to remove their names from our register, and you are advised to gather together tbe loyal members of the branch and merge then into the Central.&quot;The underground organisation of the Party still shows signs of activity and It is reported that at a recent meeting of the sub-executive of the Communist Party, a machine was inspected which, when completed, will enable the Party to print and stamp passports for any country in the world.   En uiry is being made into this report.As a result of the arrest of Borodin, Jackson, the editor of &quot;The Communist&quot; has been provisionally appointed to act as intermediary between the Conmrunist Party and Mo scow,Last week, Ered Peet opened a shop for the sale of furs and it is thought by fairly well-informed communists that * his premises will be used as a &quot;secret place&quot;,John S, Clarke, who was formerly editor of &quot;The Worker&quot; and an active communist, has BSir^el from the Party.SYLVIA/
SYLVIA PimUBST &amp; satisfactory FOURTH INTE11NATIONALTho following information Las been sent by SylviaPankhurst to the Bussian members of the Fourth International,at present in Germany:w...As for the Communist Workers1 Party.     We have now three good groups actively at work.     One in Willesden, London.     One in Portsmouth, and One in Sheffield.     Also we have scattered comrades, and small groups in many partsa&quot;In South Africa there is a branch of the Communist Workers Party 4.-th International which uses the Workers Dreadnought as its organ...-&apos;&quot;They use this o tloe, though it is so far away, as a centre for information and look to us to keep them supplied with news, literature and so on.    We have done what we can to advise them of the 4th Inter-national, end they are good workers.&quot;THE YOUNG COMMON 1ST LTDAGUf/The new secretary of the Young Communist League hascomplained to the Berlin Bureau of the Young Communist Leagueof the treatment meted out to the Young Communist representa-tive by the Executive of the Communist Party:&quot;We are having some little difficulty, with the adult Party In respect of mutual representation.&quot;Comrade HaYoung was elected as our represents-tive, and only after a long struggle, was he allowed to attend the Executive meeting of the CP.     He is now allowed only to  .ttend the full B.B.C. meetings of the Party,, in a cou-rcl attire capacity.    They will not allow him to attend any or! the Sub-Executivs meetings in any capacity whatsoever.&quot;Comrade Young attended a raeeting on August 25th to which he was suTuionod, ho went prepared to give a full report of our national Conference... When he arrived, the Party N.E.C.. put forward some very weak excuses, and rofused at first to give him a hearings&quot;It was only after great argument, that they eventually allowed him a few. minutes speech, and then told him to depart.   &quot;One orccuoo they offered was that they had little time, and &quot;shdy had more important business to deal withi,    Wo protest to, and appeal to you, that there is not many more important subjects than the relationship/
relationship between the adults and the youth, and -unless the Party in this country are made to realise        i] this, there will he small hopes of our ever accomplish-ing great progress.&quot;I have personally asked for the insertion in the Party*s paper, of an announcement of Youth Day, but there is not even one worG mentioned of this im** portant event.     We young comrades, although disappoint-dissapointed ato going to continue to &quot;Knock at the door&quot; of the adult Party,&apos;until they recognise the importance of our meeting the Party continuously, and working in the closest co-operation possible, if the Party do not realise the responsibilities witn which we are burdened then It will not be owing to any lack on our part.&quot;The main object in writing to you, is that we know the Party will take more notice of correspondence from you than they would, of mountains cf letters and interviews, from us*     The Young Communist league bears no animosity or ill, feeling to the adult Party,, all we wish for is that the Party recognise the importance snd the necessity of our young movement in this country,&quot;During the   weekend Horace Young was in Barrow-in-*Furness and reported as follows to the Berlin representativeof the Young Communist International who Is at present inEngland.&quot;Going,great guns.   First meeting last night (Sept 2nd), two thousand pcrcsetvt, no questions, grand reception.&quot;ITm negotiating for a comrade to take us to Southport T.U.C. by motor boat for nothing, otherwise it will cost about 3 quid for three or four of ua5,. 1*11 arrange for you to come up later*    I wish you were here, it would do your heart good,    The whole town is absolutely rod.    They are. patting up-fiva hundred youth day posters tonight.,   Even little girls of 14 years volunteor for the job.,   Keep the boys up to the scratch^   Donvt givothem a moment:s rest.   Above all keep Jimmy (Stewart) working donJt let him go to sleep. Write ms on all developments:,    I*m addressing local branch tomorrow night and joint meeting fl,P0 and Y,-C.L. Sunday, night and the material here is grand, but of course they have not got beyond tie old 0.-P. concept.    They^ve mainly worked along 0.K lines.    I think they1II make a new departure after my views get through,    Shertj is a strong Y.C*1. here under pseudo Cornmunlst controls    The controlling influence i3 held by CPs members who are apparently not toeing the line in the Party,    They are considering their expulsion now,    I think they can easilyDI make the branch a hundred strong here with correct methods.&quot;The English Young Communist League has sent greetings to the &quot;revolutionary Youth of Ireland on the birth of their or garni sat ion&quot;.bed/
 3D LNTERNATIOIUL 0? LABOUR U1II0HS.The nIntoixnationalPress Correspondence&quot; of August25th contains an article by J.T.MEurphy entitled &quot;The GreatRed Drive into the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain&quot;.Extracts front this article, which Is obviously for consump-tion in Moscow, &quot;bear repetition:-&quot;Blackpool saw more than the casting of 118,000 votes in our favour.    It saw the beginning of the first real attempt to organize the strength of the Red Inter-national of Labour Unions1 influence in,:&quot;the Miners1 SJederation, in the form of a powerful minority move-ment within the Federation...&quot;...0ur influence has &quot;been rapidly growing, but was lacking in organized expression and leadership, The Red International of Labour Unions1 Bureau and the Communist Party recognized this ^akness and only two months ago set the paoe for a campaign right through the organization, setting up special committees to conduct the work of agitation.&quot;Many of the districts had already elected their delegates to the conference &quot;by the time these districts were, reached.     Hot-withstanding this fact the results have been excellent.     The Blackpool Conference re-gistered the beginning of a great Red International of Labour Unions victory.   Arising directly from the con-ference and the agitation we have conducted, a new militant leadership has sprung up, rihich challenges the old bureaucratic gang;   an organized leadership from amongst the miners, which will mobilize the present minority forces with a view of winning the Miners&apos; Bade ration completely to the Red International of Labour Unions.     An organized minority movement has thus been set into motion.&quot;The lead comes at the moment from South Wales. Comrades Daviss and Cook, who led the Conference on the Red International resolution along with Comrades Ablett, J,Thomas and Dagger, all of whom are prominent official leaders of the South Wales Miners1 Federation, have led the way with a clarion call to the whole Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain.&quot;Great discontent exists throughout the Federation.-.. The great downward push in wages since the lock-out of 1921, the bitter suffering of the miners ana their families throughout the length and breadth of Britain, the refusal of the leaders to face the demands arising from these terrible conditions, all these are contribution-ing daily to inspire the miners to look for a new lead.&quot;The new lead has come and it cannot help but gather strength in face of the utter incapacity of the present leaders to measure up to $he great task of sav-ihg the miners from complete starvation conditions.
m 10 m&quot;The minority movement of tSe miners requires the complete re-organization of the Miners1 Federation, the fusion of the county organizations into a single irtcms-trial union; the elimination of non-unionism from the coal fie las, the repudiation of the Amsterdam Internatior^ and the taokling of the miners1 problems on an inter-national seals &quot;by the building of the Red International ef Labour Unions, the admission of the Russian miners into the International Miners1 Federation and its affiliation to the Bed International...&quot;The 1922 Blackpool conference marks the beginning of the fight of the revolutionary miners1 minority against sueh cowardly and treacherous leadership.     1923 will see that minority near to becoming a majority.   Look outl She great red drive has begun in the Miners1 Federation of Great Britain and nothing can stop it!&quot;The interview whioh Borodin and Wwtkins had with Oook,Afclett and Davies of the South Wales Miners1 (vide Report 169)is now hearing fruit.    A special manifesto &quot;To the Miners ofSouth Wales&quot; is published in the current issue of &quot;All Power&quot;over the signatures of S.0.Daviss, A.J.Oook, Noah Ablett,J.Thomas, George Dagger and D.L.Davies:   it appeals to theminers to &quot;haste, &quot;to avoid the impending curse of slavery and let our slogan&apos; heir- &quot;Vthe mh3erbvfotiaiBRATioN ofJsreatBRITAIN- for TfcB RED INTERNATIONAL OF LABOUR UNIONS:    and THE RED ,      INTERNATIONAL FOR THE WORKERS OF THE WORLD I&quot;&apos;Interesting light is thrown by 8.0.Davies on the publloa-tion of this appeal and on the &quot;minority&quot; movement in wales in a letter to a leading representative of the British bureau of the Red International of Labour Unions&quot;We were pleased to see Murphy last evening, and I hope that the Bureau agreed this morning to postpone the proposed Cardiff conference of September 16th to at least October 14th.     We donJt want our first conference to turn out a fiasco.   Notwithstanding the splendid re-eeption of our Leaflet, we realise that a strong body of Delegates can&quot;t get to Cardiff on enthusiasm alone. Further, as you are aware, our South Wales Miners1 -Federation Lodges are very largely bankrupt, and it is hopeless and dangerous at the inception of this campaign  f to &amp;sk;for any financial assistance;   this as you\texow wouidahe creating opposition.   It is our intention to rely on the nuclei, formed in different parts of the Coalfield, for the necessary finance to enable Delegates to attend
our first Conference.     By the way I saw yesterday with Murphy the proof of this week18 *A11 Bower1, and that you have printed the Manifesto.     You have the names of Dagger and D,. LcD&amp;vies as signatories of it.   Neither of these signed the leaflet;   Dagger refused, and Da vies was not. asked to do so.   Do please cor root this as soon as possible;   add on the names of Sydney Jones, Gwiiym Blchards, and Ted Williams.     Daggor has repented, and now states that ho refused under a misapprehension-   We are getting along very well in S.Wales.   Don*t worryl We will pull it off in this Coalfield.&quot;The Chief Constable of Morthyr Tydfil informs me that 50,000 copies of this appeal in leaflet form with the amended list of signatures have been delivered at the offices of S.0.Davios for distribution in the South Wales CoalfieldeThere has been an alteration in tho names of speakers for the Newcastle and Barrow oonferonceo of the Bed International of Labour Unions:   Pollitt will speak at Barrow and Mann at Newcastle.TBE unemployed on August 28th the wholly unemployed on the live registers totalled 1,331,400, a decrease of 2,289 on the previous week: on the same date the number working short time and drawing benefit for Intervals of unemployment was 63,400 as compared with 65,105 on August 21st.The Chief Constable of Liverpool informs me that there has been a recrudescence of activity among the unemployed in his aroa since the West Derby Board of Guardians issued a notice en August 13th to the effect that able-bodied men in receipt of out-door relief would be required to perform certain relief work, road-making eto.f for at least three days a weeH, without wages, and that whilst men who appeared anxious to work and were suitable, might be employed permanently and struck off the out-door relief scale, anyone who refused to do the work would leave themselves liable to disqualification from outdoor relief.Meetings of protest against the test scheme have been held a*iiy/
daily and on August 25th H.G.Nowbold, organiser of No.4 division Burton from &amp;lossop4 Cook of Altrincham and Hetherington of Openshaw arrlvoa in Liverpool and stated that they would remain there for ah.indefinite period with a view to organising a scheme to defeat the proposal of the Guardians:    about 150 men who have been ordered to perform test work are stated to have refused and some have had their outdoor relief stopped in consequence. .-:v -I am informed by the Chief Constable of Birmingham that the unemployed marchers returned from London to Birmingham on September 3rd,     Seven to eight hundred men., -women and&apos;-jQhi&amp;* dren assembled in the Bull Ring and Leaded by two bands $ ,   ... Councillor Shurmer ana Charles Mann, a member&apos;of the local Board of Guardians, marohed in procession&apos;to Small Heath Bark, where they were met by the London marchers.     The pr^oession-ists then returned to the Bull Ring, led by the bands and London marchers.     After the: latter had been entertained to tea, meetings were held in the Bull Ring and speeches delivered from four platforms by a number of speakers.The Chief Constable of Coventry informs me that a meeting of the unemployed in his area on September 2nd was addressed by some of the marchers who gave grossly exaggerated accounts of their success in London ecu on the march,,.The Chief. Constable of .Eainbxxrgh informs me that a new local unemployed committee was. formed cn August 31st:   Robert ?oulisff who was appointed chairman,.stated that he intended to demonstrate before the Town Council, Parish Council, Educational Authorities and Board of Health.   At the same meeting the offer of two Edinburgh fishmongers to supply the unemployed with from&quot;&apos; fourteen to twenty boxes of fresh fish daily free of charge was refused by 65 votes to 32 on the grounds that no charity be re-ceived by the unemployed.THE/
