German Government has, since the Armistice, balanced its 3udgets by the issue of Treasury Bills and covered its payments by the increase of the fiduciary circulation, thus depreciating the mark and destroying its gold value.   Meanwhile, it has incurred large expenditure on subsidies, which it has only recently taken steps to abolish.The Allied Governments will.only agree to the grant of a further moratorium to the German Government, if effective guarantees are secured that these conditions will not recur.These guarantees are as follows:-1.    The German Government Shall proceed to the exectition of all measures required by the Reparation Commission to ensure the full autonomy of the Reichsbank and shall give the Reparation Commission the fullest power of scrutiny to ensure the efficacy of these measures.2.

If at any time the Commission 1* not satisfied that this is the case the Committee of Guarantees shall have the.right to take over the sums standing to the credit of this account and to secure the payment to it of the produce of these duties thereafter.5.    The German Government shall carry into affect the arrangement? made with the Committee of Guarantees for the supervision both of the receipts and of the expenditure of the Budget and shall give tho representatives of that Committee the fullest facilities for investigating and reporting on all proposals affecting either side of the Budget.
6V        The German Government shall proceed to carry into effect the .proposed legislation agreed upon with the Committee of Guarantees with a view to preventing the export of capital and shall give the representatives .of the Committee of Guarantees the fullest facilities for observing and reporting:on the execution of this measure.,7.

Subject to the acceptance by the German Government of these guarantees the Reparation-Commission will grant a moratorium in respect of all,cash payments remaining due from Germany up to the. 31st December, 1922 and further the Commission shall as soon as possible fix the annual payments in cash in respect of all Peace Treaty charges for the succeeding period at such an amount not exceeding 26$ of the value of German exports as they may find to be proper with a view to the early
flotation of a loan by the German Government, the major portion of which loan shall be devoted to the payment of reparation. 2?he Committee of Guarantees shall during the period of the moratorium and to the extent decided upon by the Reparation Commission transfer each week to the &quot;German.
