s g 0 RET. O.P. No.4143.CABINET. REPORT   OF    CO^ITTEEo nGROWN   AND   GOY^-KENT   LANDS; Meraorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.The Report of Sir Howard Frank&apos;s Committee has been carefully considered at the Admiralty, and as requested by the Chancellor of the Exchequer In his Memorandum CP. 4037 I forward the foil erring remarks on the Coirrolttee s recommen-dations.Briefly, the Actedralty position is that they are entirely satisfied with the present system under which they have their own Lands Branch as part of the Department of the Civil Engp.neer-in-Chief, which deals under that Officer with the multifarious questions relating to Admiralty property, ri$its and obligations, most of which have a special naval and technical aspect -with which ordinary lands surveyors are wholly unfamiliar.For the purpose, however, of the purchase and sale of land and advice on valuation questions, such as arise in dealing with property taken by the Admiralty under the Prerogative and the Defence of the Realm Act, the services of the Valuation Department of the Board of Inland Revenue are used, and have always given complete satisfaction.If anything like the bulk of the work of the Lands Branch consisted merely of property valuations and negotiations, as in the ordinary conduct of private estates, It follows that I should feel little or no objection to the whole being placed in the hands of a Central body.    But so far is this from being the case, and so wide &apos;are the ramifications of the Branch, and so peculiar to the requirements of the Naval Service, that the Admiralty are convinced that the application of the Cortmittee&apos; s recommendations would only result ih circumlocution, delay, and inconvenience, and would certainly bring about no financial sav-ing.    On this general question, I cannot do better than circu-late, as an Appendix to this Memorandum, a copy of an official letter which the Admiralty addressed to the Committee on March 22nd last.I observe, further, that the Committee, in paragraphs 14 and 15 of their Report, in recommending that the proposed central organisation should second to the War Department the staff necessary to carry out the local work of the Commands, consider that &quot;treatment on the same lines will meet the corres-ponding difficulties of the Admiralty.     With regard to this, I would point out that the staff of the Admiralty Lands Branch is employed entirely at Headquarters, and that the Admiralty possess no local Land Agents; the local work is done by the Officers In charge of works as incidental to their general duties; valuation, purchase, and sale being carried out, as already /
already stated, by Officers of the Valuation Department of the Board, of Inland Revenue.    If the Committee intend that a similar seconding of staff should take place at Headquarters, and that the seconded unit should, work entirely with, the Admiralty, under the sole control of the Admiralty Board, the Admiralty objections to the Corn-nit tee s Report would no doubt to a large extent be met, although, they can see no advantage -whatever in the change from the point of view of economy or sotind administration.It is not clear, moreover, whether the Committee pro-pose that the new authority shall be responsible for adminis-tration of lands abroad, although * very large part of the work of the Admiralty Lands branch relates to property outside the United Kingdom.To sum up, the Admiralty view is, therefore, that their present Lands Branch should be left as it is, but they have no objection to the work of valuation, -purchase, and sale of land etc., being performed by the Valuation Department, which is the course at present followed, and it is immaterial whether that Department is continued under the Board, of Inland. Revenue or transferred to some other organization.ADMIRALTY, S.w*.l. 1st August, 1922.(Bitd.)   L of F.A P P H! N D I X.C.E.in C.33163/21 (Pt)/l8A.5x1With reference to the mee-ADMIRALTY,  S.77.1.22nd March, 1922,of the Committee on government Lands etc., held on the 2nd instant, when a,repre-sentative attended on behalf of the Admiralty,  I am commanded by Itfr Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to communicate, for &quot;the information of the Cqmnd.tt.ee, the following observations-2.       The question of concentrating Government Lands work in a centralised Department has on various occasions been the subject of the most careful consideration by their Lordships, with the result that they feel that such a proposal is to be strongly deprecated as calculated to result in delays, loss of efficiency and. to affect adversely economy in administration, both directly and indirectly.    Owing to the Committee&apos;s pro-ceedings on the 2nd instant being confined to a series of interrogatories, it was not possible for the Admiralty witness to put before the Committee the Admiralty points of view to the extent that had been contemplated.3.       It is of course rot known in what direction the minds of the Committee may be moving, whether towards the formationThe Secretary,&apos;.ttee on Government Lands, etci TREASURY,    S.W.I.of
o* . o^t^i body, presumably absorbing: the hulk, if not all, oj        wewnt personnel W dealing-dth lands matters in the v1Trioyo&quot; n^nn^allotments, or Aether it is intended to leave in each Department at least a &quot;liaison&quot;  st^ff, the central body confining itself mainly or wholly to purchasessnd sales and other matters directly&quot; involving valuation work.4.       Dealing with the latter first, I an to state that the Admiralty work relating to purchases and sales, involving valuation and negotiations, in normal years ahsorts hut a very small portion of the activities of the staff.    Such work, while being snail, is also variable in its periodical incidence and geographical distribution.     Any work that arises requires the assistance of expert local knowledge, and, as the Com-eiittee are already aware, the Admiralty have in recent years had the benefit of the assistance of the looal staff of the Valuation Department with completely satisfactory results. My Lords do not suppose that such work performed for them by the Valuation Department would in normal years involve any addition to the Valuation Staff over that required by its other dutie s.5.       Should a complete transfer of the whole of the Lands -work   of the Department and the severance of its personnel be in contemplation, My Lords wish to express the strongest dissent against such a proposal.    They feel that such a move in the direction of further centralisation would be retrogressive and have a deplorable effect upon the irrork.6.       The Lands work of each Government Department presents special features, being governed by various Acts of Parliament, and by precedents and practices which have become recognised as necessary in the public interest through generations of manage-ment.    For such reasons It 4 s held that the work, if centralised, would, become too complex and unwieldy to be carried out with the maximum degree of expedition and the minimum, of clrcurolo-cutlon.    Such co-ordination as is necessary in regard to the Lands work of the various Government Departments, is, it is considered, already performed efficiently by the system of Treasury instructions ,and control hitherto in vogue.7.       The Memorandum showing the scope of the duties of the Admiralty Lands Branch, which has already been furnished to the Committee, may be taken as an index to the wider ramifications of the work of the Branch and is evidence that much of it is peculiar to the requirements of the Naval Service; at the same time it does not bring out what is in fact the case that the efficient performance of the duties of the Branch requires a very considerable and varied knowledge of work connected vrith land and marine structures, water supply, drainage, work etc. scarcely deemed to fall within the training of men engaged exclusively or mainly on Estate valuation work,    such structural questions are dealt with locally by the Admiralty Civil Engineer-ing Staff, v,.ho work in collaboration with the Lands Branch&quot; under the supervision of the Civil Engineer in Chief.8.       Apart from the foregoing considerations, My Lords   most serious objection to a centralised hands Department, assuming that it would mean an absorption or dispersion of the present Lands personnel, is due to the interruption which would occur in the direct personal contact and relations with the membersof
of the other Admiralty Departments served by the Lands Branch; such epmtact at present i-s a very real one. throuphout the whole &quot;of the working hours, grid. Ify Lords scarcely care to contemplate the delays and circumlocution which would: he inevitable If the Lands work, in which other Department-s of the Admiralty are invariably interested, was carried on under a centralised body away from the Admiralty.    These, remarks are founded on experience because the Lands work -was in, former years carried on in an isolated building; and the &quot;benefit of its absorption under the Admiralty roof has &quot;been very fully realised,9.       Apart from the detachment of the Lands Staff from the other Departments of the Admiralty, Which is so ranch to he deprecated for the reasons given, My Lords would be deeply concerned if they thought it probable that the Admiralty Lands work would become part of another adminis--tration, and their present control over that work, and the authority to give direct instructions and to ensure prompt action, were to disappear.10.       Looked at from the standpoint of economy alone, experience suggests that the -joining up of Departments into &quot;big centralised organisations results in increased staffs and expenditure., the mere size of the Department generally necessitating great charges for adTiLni strati on Which are not counterbalanced by any appreciable saving in the Depart-raent from Whioh &apos; the work and staff have been collected.;; but this is no doubt more a consideration for H.M.Treasury, and My Lords base their very strong objections to such cohcen-tration mainly on the ground of the general delay and decreased efficiency In the performance of the work which they are con-confident would, he the inevitable result.11.       In conclusion, I am to point out that the Admiralty Lands Administration is based mainl:/- on certain statutes in which the powers and duties are vested in the Lords Commission-ers, amongst which may he citedOoast Guard Service Act, 1856. Harbours Transfer Act,     1862. Admiralty Lands and Works Act, 1854. - do. - - do. - 1865.Dockyard Ports Regulations Act,1865.The Act of 1864 explicitly defines the extent and limitations of the Admiralty pavers relating to the acquisition and dis-posal of lands (under Treasury super?! si on) and vests and places the management of same in the Lords Commissioners, and it is presumed that any change in this respect would, require to be the subject of fresh legislation.12.       Seven copies of this letter are transmitted in accord-anoe with the request of the Committee In the case of the pre-vious documents furnished.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd.)
