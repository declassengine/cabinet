summaryThere is at present little political activity in communist circles, but the industrial policy is being developed as rapidly as possible:   there are indications that every effort will be made toy exploit real and imaginary grievances among miners, railwaymen and engineers.The annual conference of the Miners&quot; federation of Great Britain opens at Blackpool on July 18th and will review the operation of the national agreement:   as a result of the executive meeting in London last week, the National Board will meet in London on July 28th to discuss the position in the coalfields.   On July 11th miners on strike at South Shields came into conflict with the police and arrests were made.The engineering trade unions are to ballot on the employers1 proposals for a reduction of the war bonus, the papers being returnable on July 26th.   The membership of the Amalgamated&apos; Engineering Union had dropped to 393,043 at the eud of June* 98,000 being unemployed.The recent conference of the National Union of Railwaymen defeated by 76 to 3 votes a resolution calling upon Mr. J.H. Thomas to resign his position of Privy Councillor:   the conference decided to refer back to branches the proposal to affiliate to the National Federation of Transport Workers.V Extracts from the first report of the Commission set up by theCommuasst Party to examine the Party organisation and make recommendations for the application of the Theses of the Third International are given as an appends to this report.The Young Communist League has drawn up a draft constitution which, if ratified by the national conference, w* 1 commit it to a militant policy.Communists in load on are in touch with Irish extremists.It is requested that this document may be &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;    treated as highly confidential.Ihis document is the property of His Majesty^ Government.Report..$0,, 163aSpecial Branch,New Scotland Yard, S.W.1,REPORT ON RSVOLUT IOBARY ORGANISATIONS IN THE UNITED 1CIMGDOMTHE COMMUNISTS.............................. .Page 1THE UNEMPLOYED............................... &quot; 5&quot;NO MORE WAR&quot;MO movement....................... &quot; 6THE YOUNG COMMUNIST LEAGUE................... &quot; 6ARREST...................................... &quot; 7THE COMMUNISTS AND IRELAND................... &quot; irish REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN GREA3!BRITAIN................................ &quot; 8APPENDIX...........July 13 tlx. 19 8 ,
THE COMITUKISTSOn June 7th a special meeting of the -PI enary Pxecutive Committee of the Comintern was held in Mosoov;: some 56 delegates were present including Tom Bell:   the main object of the.meeting was to . discuss-  the general situation in Western Europe, where the danger of splits . between Left and Bight communist wings has produced considerable difficulties for the Comintern-     The situation is further complicated by the inability of the Soviet Go\*emment to make the same financial grants as hitherto and the whole position was more or less shelved until the -fourth Congress of the Third International, which is to be held shortly.     Extremists such as Radek, Bukharin and Kuusinen favour an active -policy but Zinoviev is reported to have proposed a policy of compromise based upon the necessity for forming united labour-socialist governments:   the left communists are strongly opposed to the latter proposal.The re-organisation of the Communist Party in this country is proceeding under the direction of the Commission whose first report is now being considered by branches:   extracts from this important document are given as an appendix.The sub-executive of th^ Party decided at a secret meeting in London on June 23rd:(a) that all the work of the New Joint Industrial Committee should be done through arrangements with divisional organisers;(b) that organisers should be allocated a certain amount each ??eek;(o)   that the sub-executive should control all finance in connection therewith;(a)/
(d) that the Joint Industrial Committee should from time to time prepare a budget to be submitted to the sub-executive, outlining work to be done and expenditure necessitated.Recommendations of the Commission regarding the Joint Industrial Committee were considered and adopted by the sub-executive:   these divided the work into the following seotions:(1)   Press and Publicity.(2)   Trade Unions.    :(S)   Trades Counoils, Trade Union Congress, etc. i4)   Workshops.The adopted recommendations further laid down that the Joint Industrial Committee should -&quot;appoint advisory committees for the principal unions to be covered, consisting of Party members of influence in a given Union, which will continuously advise on the detailed policy to be followed in a particular union,&quot;The personnel of the Joint Industrial Committee appearsto overlap that of the &quot;Industrial. Department&quot;,   as thefollowing were present at the first meeting of the latterbody on July 4th:   H, Webb, W. McLaine, J.T. Murphy, F, Peetand H, Pollitt (in the chair).     The minutes of this meeting as under, are of considerable interest:&quot;Letters were read and explanations given as to the absence of members of the Department.    After arrangements had been made all members nominated would be able to attend except Eime, who was doubtful.   Webb as Aatiag Organiser of the Party was elected as pro.tern, secretary pending the return of Bell.&quot;The relation of special Industrial Committee to the department was disoussed and it was decided that Murphy report activities of Industrial Committee to Department.   Peet, who was present to report on behalf of the Sub-Executive Committee submitted memorandum on Terms of Reference,   Murphy urged that care be taken    m* not to. overburden the new Department with too many       xj issues.    It was decided that secretary act as sub-Executive representativs to the Department and to report to sub-Executive Committee.&quot;Consideration was given to immediate work and itwas/
&apos; ...    13was decided that special attention &quot;be given to the National Union of Railwayman.     Secretary was instructed to forward circular to Party members of the National Union of Railwayman urging them to forward suggestions and material for use of Department.&quot;Articles to he written for the &quot;Railway Review8 and assistance secured to get publication of same.   The first of these articles to show why railwaymen have become the new aristocracy of Labour giving the economics of the case, and combatting the motion that the Railwaymen&apos;3 status is due to leadership.   This article to be followed&apos;by.one on Policy relating the position and needs of railwaymen to the Industrial movement generally.   Comrades Murphy and Newbold were deputed to write the articles.&quot;Secretary was instructed to write to Sub-Executive Committee urging the need for a statement in JIhe Communist&apos; refuting the charges that it is   the Party&apos;s policy to disrupt the unions.   It was agreed that absent members of committee be supplied with terms of referenoe and report of meeting.&quot;It was agreed that Department meet weekly on Tuesday 7 p.m.&quot;That the communists are getting down to business asregards their industrial policy is proved by a circular sentto divisional organisers by Harry Webb on July 5th!&quot;It is exceedingly important that you should take immediate measures to become acquainted with the party members who are delegates in your division to the Conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, to be held on July 18th in Blackpool.&apos; A meeting of such delegates between now and that day. for the purpose&quot;of considering the Agenda and the policy to be pursued, would be desirable.   Please convene such a meeting at once if possible.&quot;If such a meeting is impossible, then copies of the enclosed memoranda on the most important issues should be sent to them, with instructions to be in Blackpool for a meeting of Communist delegates, on Monday evening, July 17th.   Particulars as to time and place will be notified.&quot;The resolution on the Agenda for the National Conference reads as follows;-*That the Miners&apos; Federation of Great&apos; Britain be urged to affiliate and actively identify itself with the Third International.&apos;&quot;At the moment we do not know whether this was the actual resolution submitted by South Wales, or whether it has been perverted, for obviously it should read:-&apos;That the Miners&apos;  federation affiliate to the Red International of Labour Unions as the best means of securing the real international solidarity of labour.1&quot;The/
&quot;The best spe:akers you can get from the delegates should, be speoially prepared to participate in the debate, and. at the meeting in Blackpool prior to the Conference, the best arrangements possible should be devised for successful team work by the supporters of our motion.&quot;We axe sending you, herewith, data and resolutions    * that we have just issued, a Theses and material on our case for affiliation to the Red International of Labour Unions which should be followed closely by our delegate .-. members. &quot;/    &quot;If there are any Miners1 Lodge meetings in your -   .   Division between now and the Miners&apos; Conference, theresolution on affiliation should be ra 3ed and every effort made to 3end the delegate chosen to the Conference with a mandate.&quot;Where we have suggested amendments the delegates whom yoxi bring together should consider how best these amendments can be woven into the agenda in view of their greater familiarity with the Standing Orders procedure of the Conference.&quot;The memorandum mentioned in this circular is a lengthy statement on points which speakers advocating affiliation to the Bed International of Labour Unions should make:   the -following passage bears quotation:&quot;Relation with the Communist International-    &quot;It will be said that it means joining the Communist International and being subject to dictatorship from the Communist International.   That is untrue.   The two internationals are separate.   Having their own conferences, their own offices, their own constitutions.   Conditions of admission&apos;to the Communist International are entirely different to those governing the Red International of Labour Unions.&quot;Prank Smith is in charge of the propaganda campaign in    -connection with the forthcoming conference of the Miners1 Federation of Great Britain and, after distributing large quantities of leaflets, still has IS.&apos;,000 on order from the printers:   he has urged Mat Watkins, the secretary of the Red International of Labour Unions, to come back to London from Doncaster as the situation needs his personal attention.&quot;Alec Geddes. who was for some time in charge of the underground organisation of the Communist Party, has been investigating revolutionary possibilities among the life miners: he reports that there &quot;never has been such a strong rebelelement&quot;/
element", but that it is fighting shy of the party and is concentrating on the struggle with the union.

The current issue of "The Communist" is to be "a special miners&apos; number".

The decision of the Labour Party to refuse communist affiliation may result in difficult situations in some Trades and Labour Councils: in East Ham, for instance, the communists have a majority and, if pressed, intend to pass a resolution recommending their own expulsion: the idea is then to set up a Red International of Labour Unions&apos; Council.

Communist headquarters have informed Yorkshire branches that Bishop and Squair will visit their area shortly and should be given every assistance: these two men have recently addressed meetings in Derby and Nottingham but their tour has so far not proved successful, although they took part in a demonstration to the houses of two Derby Guardians on July 4th.

Guy Aldred, who is still in London, intends to start a newspaper which may be called "The Red" and will doubtless voice the views of the Anti-Parliamentary Communist Group. 

W.P. Earsman, the Australian communist, has been in consultation with the sub-Executive of the Communist Party and has proposed "that London should be the medium of communications between the Centre and Australia".



THE UNEMPLOYED

On July 3rd the wholly unemployed on the live registers totalled approximately 1,389,000, a decrease of 15,393 on the previous week.

Unemployed meetings continue to be held in London and the provinces but interest in them has waned although speakers have made as much capital as possible out of the unemployment benefit regulations.

The/


The Birmingham unemployed are contemplating a march to London and propose to pass through the following places; Coventry, Rugby, Borthampton, Bedford, Luton, St, Albans:   the Chief Constable of Birmingham is doubtful If the organisers will carry out their plans.&quot;HO MORE WAR&quot; MOVEMENT ,   ,On July 29th demonstrations in oonneotion with the &quot;lie More War&quot; movement will be held In London, in the provinces and in various towns in Europe:   the movement in this country is not communist although, in some oases, communists will participate in the demonstrations.THE YQUNS COMMUNIST LEAGUEThe current issue of &quot;The Young Communist&quot; contains theproposed constitution of the League which will be submitted tothe forthcoming national conference:   if, as is possible, this be ratified the League will be definitely bound to a militantprogramme since it is laid down in the constitution that:&quot;The Young Oommuniat League accepts without reserve the Theses of the Young Communist International,   and bases the structure of the organisation, its entire work. Economic, Political, and Educational on those Theses.&quot;On June 83rd, 1922, the Executive Committee of the YoungCommunist International in Moscow issued the following secretcircular regarding the establishment of a Central PropagandaCommittee;   copies of this document have been sent to theEnglish, organiser;&quot;A long standing need of the Executive Committee and of the individual Leagues should be fulfilled by the formation of the Propaganda Central Committee.   For the formation ef this Central Propaganda Committee the co-operation of the Leagues is necessary.   We give here an     \ outline of the tasks of this O.P.O. and the tasks of the national Executive Committees with regard to this.&quot;One of the principal factors for the formation of the C.P.C. is the centralisation of the propaganda methods in the individual Leagues.   The application of agitation and propaganda material for the whole International, to provide further forms and material to place our common propagandaon/t
on a broader basis and to avoid monotony through greater variety in this direotion.&apos; The CP.0. has the further task of providing drawings, photographs and carricatures for pictorial representation in their press.   The production ana collection of lantern slide series for agitation and educational work is one of the main tasks of the C.P.C. and bhe individual Leagties partaking in this work.   Further we-wish with-the help of the C.P.C. to facilitate the organisation of propaganda trips to which international speakers will be sent.   The O.P.O. will produce all kinds of recruiting material, placards, postcards which the Leagues may order and use for the various occasions which may arise. The early organisation for the most significant days of the working class movement is of the utmost importance, together with the provision and representation of the necessary material,&quot;A further factor will be the preparation and provision of propaganda for our international and national literature..&quot;All your organisations must be informed of our need of such material and its early dispatch required.     We ask you to do this as soon as xoossible that we may commence the wor k imme d i at ely.&quot;ARRESTOn July 6th Ex-Inspector Syme was found guilty at Bow Street Police Oourt of using language likely to create a breach of the peace and was bound over to be of good behaviour in two -sureties of  100 each and in his own recognizances of  200:   in default Syme was eentenoed to three months&apos; imprisonment:   he said that he would -serve the sentence.   The charge arose from the speech made by Syme in Trafalgar Square on July 2ftd in which he said, &quot;I have been fighting now for 13 years and I am about sick of it and if I get a chance next week the King and gxeen are going through it, so if the King gets hurt next week he has only himself to blame because he has cowardly refused to do his duty.&quot;THE OQMMUHISTs M3 IRELANDLight is thrown on the relations between the Communist Party and Irish extremists by a letter recently written by Fred Peet to Willie Gallacher in which he says;&quot;We/
&quot;we carefully informed Jackson (editor of &quot;The communist) of the Terms of Reference for the article on the front page, which was to consist of a carefully written article, the main theme of which was to call upon the British Government not to send arms to the Free Staters, hut hold our hand as to our exact position. i.e., whom we were supporting, until we could have consulted with you and the others who are coming over.   We felt that as delegates were coming over we could tread warily and at the same time have a bit of a slashing article. He then proceeds to write in italics and to give particular prominenoe to the sentiment that we, if we had the choioe would be behind de Valera and 0&apos;Connor because they are fighting the British Empire.&quot;In this connection it may be mentioned that Herman Ewer, foreign editor of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, invited C. 01Sullivan * an Irish communist in London, to visit him this week, as he had received a communication from Cork.Sylvia Pankhurst is also in touch with Irish extremists, though with the Fourth International section and not with the Communist Party of Ireland,   a member of the &quot;Economic Section (Section Industrial Workers of the World)&quot; has expressed the hope that his group will be backed by the Fourth International as &quot;our fight is your fight and this country is the key to the world&quot;, and has sent her an article for insertion in the &quot;Workers1 Dreadnought&quot;.IRISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES 1X1 GREAT BRITAINThe Irish in Great Britain remain remarkably cuiet, considering the extraordinary happenings in their native land. Here and there a few individuals are crossing to Ireland to fight on one side or the other but the majority are by no means keen to join the fray.The Irregulars have agents touring the country whipping uprecruits - one of them visited the Tyne-side recently andinduced a few men, including &quot;Commandant&quot; Murray, to go over. ^He was not, however, very successful as the local leaders,Furcell and Connolly, who have great influence, are supporters of/
of the Free State. . Murray was liberated from prison in Newcastle early this year, having been convicted for offences in Belfast:   he called himself an engineer and sometimes wore an Irish Republican Army uniform.The bad feeling between Art 0&apos;Brien and J.H. McDonnell, referred to in a previous report, has increased owing to the latter having been appointed Solicitor in London to the FreeState Government.The London Republicans are now seeking to hide their activities under the cloa^ of the Gaelic League, so as to escape much of the attention bestowed by the authorities on the Irish Self-Betermination League, their former camouflage.In Irish circles favourable to the Treaty the view is expressed that the task of the Provisional Government is greater than the English press would lead one to believe., Big Republican forces are said to be in Cork, Kerry and part of Limerick.   Their commanders issue orders which are printed in the local newspapers and are generally obeyed by the people who have no choice, although the majority are sick and tired of the situation and aocious to see law and order restored.At a recent meeting of the Manchester District Committee of the Irish Self-Determination League, Advantage was taken by the Republicans of the absence of Free State supporters to pass a resolution expressing regret that Collins and the Provisional Government &quot;at the bidding of the English Government should wage a cruel, ruthless and bloody warfare against the men who have, during the last few years, fought so strenuously for the freedom of Ireland&quot;.A meeting of the Scottish Sinn Fein Executive was held in Senfield Street, Glasgow, on the 8th July when a vote was taken regarding the attitude of the various clubs on the questionof/
mmof the Treaty.   Out of about 100 delegatea present 51 voted against the Treaty, If were in favour and the balance remained neutral, ^John Martin, Provision Merchant, Gallowgate, lectured in the Connolly Club, on July 9th on &quot;The one Bite.ok Spot in Ireland&quot; which he described as Griffith and Collins: Martin is m uncompromising Republican:   Michael 0&apos;Leary, Vioe President of the Club, was in the chair.   The Hall was well filled, many of those present being business people andover  4 was taken at the collection!   Martin appealed to the people to stand united and assured them that there will never be peace in Ireland till the last vestige of Britishauthority is cleared out.
APPENDIX17: : THE COMMUNIST PARTY COMMISSIOJS FIRST REPORT   \,. &apos;&apos;: j&quot;A copy of this document, to which reference was mad$ ^ in last week&apos;s report, has.been procured:   in view of itsImpartanoe,.the following extracts seem worth quotation although many of the points have been covered in previous reports.&quot;Terms of Reference .,,&quot;To review the^organisation of the Party in the light of the Theses, and to make detailed recommendations to the Executive and to the Annual Conference for the     ; application of the Theses.&quot;In particular it ahall be the function of the Commission:(1)   To draft such revisions of the Constitution as may seem necessary to bring it into accord with the &quot;&quot;&apos; Theses.&apos;( 8)   W examine sad report oh the exist lag divisions, areas and other units.(5)   To draw up a full scheme for the co-ordination and direction of groups and nuclei in the Trade Unions and other working class,organisations and to make recommendations as to the first steps to be taken in the practical operation of this scheme.(4)   To consider the organisation of the Party oentre and make recommendations.(5)   To bring under review the Party Press and other forms of propaganda in order to make possible a more effective fulfillment of the Theses in these respects,&quot;The commission shall be empowered to call for reports from any and every section of the Party organisation, anil shall have access to all necessary documents for the purpose of conducting its enquiries, but shall have no   ?; executive powers*&quot;The Commission shall issue a first report not more than one month after the date of its appointment, and shall present a complete report to the Annual Conference.Wherever advisable or possible the Executive shall put into operation interim recommendations without delay.&quot;&quot;Financial SituationWe very soon found that our immediate urgency work was of a very much more exhaustive character than we had anticipated, owing particularly to the; financial situation.. We found the position of the Party compelled very drastic remedies in order to get things straight, and a considerable proportion of our first six weeks1 work was taken up.with the working out;detailed measures to meet% this/
this situation in cutting down Headquarters expenses etc. We are now in a position to report to members that the financial situation has been definitely dealt with, though., at a very heavy cost.   The permanent staff at Headquarters.......is now down to 0Ge Secretary, one Organiser, and two ,clerical workers.   Branches are already aware Of the very&quot;7 heavy burdens thrown 0$ Divisions, ,which have risen to the occasion with a spirit of self-sacrifice and effort that has exceeded all anticipation.   We believe that once we can get ottjf work going&apos; on the new basis the position is certain to improve.nA further aspect of our urgency work has been the question of subscriptions.../.   . 1    &apos; ;   -  .  0,.&quot;..&apos;-&quot;We went into ^&apos;he whole of this question in detail arid pre-pared a revised.scheme for the Executive on the: basis of -a flat rate of a shilling per month per member. This scheme the details of which will have been received by branches, was adopted by the Executive to be put into-operation on July 1st,&quot;Present position of tho Party&quot;We believe that the present position of the Party calls for serious oonsidei-ation by every member.   The Party has now been in existence for nearly two years. They have been two years,of.tremendous happenings, of great revolutionary significance, and of a world wide Communist impetus.   Yet in these two years with all their opportunities the Party has made no real progress. Despite&apos; any: fluctuations that have taken place, it is &quot;     true bo say that generally, over the.two years&apos; -Shore has, been no appreciable increase of membership, and wicihin the period for which we have records, there ban even been a downward tendency.    It has not established ths tufluenqe, that j.&apos;G should have, done in the Unions and the working.....cla&apos;33 movement,,   Despite the tireless activity ofiadivj-lual members, the &quot;Party, as the Pa.&apos;.- by, &quot;ha,i not rtiipac. advantage.   There have been campaigns, but they: havo yielded no lasting results,   Bujid^ads of m&quot;irbc:.*s have drifted &quot;in and drifted out;;aga in &quot;bec aurse &quot;shay have found nothing to&apos; hold them.    At the pre Bent time branches on every sile are having a hard fight to maintain activity and . enthusiasm in the face of apparent lack of results and .. .... waning Interest.      &apos;     -&quot;We believe that, the present weakness of our position is due to lack of proper methods in our work and policy. We have been following the lines of the old Socialist ,. -parties:.   though in name ,a. Communist Par cy, wo have not yet grasped how to carry on revolutionary Communist organisation and policy... . ,&quot;It is perhaps the most hopeful feature of the situation that &quot;the cause, in our judgment, lies, not in any lack of enthusiasm in our members or sympathy outside, but in lack of knowledge of how-to harness that enthusiasm , and sympathy for concerted- action-, fur positive results    ^&apos; and policies-which would make the maximum &quot;ceo of our membership and build up the influence of the Party,   This point, it is necessary to explain by actual examples:,. WHAT :cbMMUMIST: ORGAN I SAT IOE. HE AW S.. .&quot;A/
18&apos; v * &apos; &apos; - 3 -   ; &quot;:&quot;A communist party is the, leading party of the working class:   it exists hot ^&quot;&quot;&quot;propagate a certain theory or doctrine, but to give a lead to the working class, and all its work is organised for this purpose.   Its objeot is hot simply to spread general propaganda1 but to establish a systematic organised influence throughout the Working olass movement.   Until this is achieved,Communist manifestoes will only sound like phrasemongering without-backing-. &apos;&quot;For this purpose it is not enough for individuals . -   to be active in their sphere;   their work must be part af a common campaign directed by the Party as.a whole.    It is , not enough&quot;for the Centre of; Division to issue manifestoes     f and circulars;   they must actively direct the daily work .:. of the membership..,&quot;The method to carry this out Is explained in the Theses on Organisation.   Th?ee great principles are set put which are all new to this country!-ft I   Srouu Work.   The method of sharing out the work and responsibility is by making every asmber a, member of a   I Working group:   that is to say, either of a special committee in charge of some special&apos;&quot;adtivity under the direction of the district or centre, or of a nucleus which is carrying out the Party policy in seme working Glass organisation.   The branch becomes the registering centre for common meetings of members and for distribute ing the wo rk.(&amp;)   Reports.   To give unity to the work of those groups it is1 necessary-ts have a system of regular reports each group reporting regularly to the directing authority in charge of its work...(3)   Instructions.   Every ad tivity has its leading committee*  or &quot;directing authority: appointed by and subject to the  j &apos; Exeoutive Committee, which supervises the actual work . -    and gives day to day instructions (not generalinstructions) &quot;on what to da and what is the correct \       -&apos; Party line to follow..   Without such specif io ( instructionss -groups-and;members will either be inactive;r,.-.&apos;-&amp;c else will act individually, without combined force , and with possibly conflicting policies, \&quot;Present Weaknesses&quot;At the present time we are hampered from performing effective work by a variety of causes, of which the following may be suggested as the most import ant:-. (lj   Lack of organisation at the Centre.(2)   Weakness of. local organisation.   -Z)   Obsolete character of the Constitution. ... Absence of direction of activities.-&quot;5) . Lack of Party Frogramme*;  , t. t6)   Lack &quot;of, regular Party training,,. 7)   Weakness qf Preps and propaganda. &apos;;. :, . (81. Lack of. Communist understanding of the-   obligations&apos; of, a member.V
The work at Headquarters Is too much of an official and paid character;   the outside members are not brought in.   The Party Headquarters are an insurmountable fortress to the ordinary member.   Tnere is no regular --organisation of voluntary work.   There is no system of -committees to heipltbj. guidje thWwprk and v  $re pare the policy for the sub-Eiecut;ive.; The&apos; day-to-day work is left fn&apos;;the:;hands; of a few; paid,,officiais, who/find it iuipossiblei to . cope with; the..details involve^,   Thus, on   1 the other hand, necessary work is left uncovered or&quot;is dealt&apos;::with. $00:hastily^ t^:imm&amp; . prepayaH^a;   on the other hand a;sense:of separation, wholly opposed to the Communist spirit, becomes visible, between members at Headquarters and those outside, ,,- VTha present-system, of branch organisation needs careful consideration. Fifty per cent of the present branches&apos; have- under&apos; 20 members, and a -goodf&quot;property on of-these&quot;&apos;-under 10. &quot; Under these conditions it&apos;is difficult to maintain effective branch activity, hold good meetings, keep up,interesttand work, and it is next to Impossible for;--&apos;mo-Bt brfenche^,, tb&apos;-maintain fooms;%here , llteratur e can:&apos; be ; sold-;;,: and but si ders&apos; drop-; in, &apos;-&apos;that. mig&amp;fc&apos;;serve as a centre -Cof:spr6paganaa for&apos; the- neighbourhoods   The average &quot;branch, is no$ em^ll and compact enough to .make a working &apos;local/group, &apos; and not large enough to.....make a strong branch,and&apos; is consequently in many cases in a half-alive,condition.   This position is not inevitable;   in many of&apos;the big^centres there are several separate branches of varying wealtnesB;&apos;,,which might be more effective as a single strong branchy based., on. local groups.   To this guestioh&quot;we,, shall have, to! cb^e in;;detail in our next Report,   it;,&apos;, pre sent one third.-of &quot;the.branches are reported&apos;by the orgaMser as * inactive1, &apos;biid&quot;, \ indifferentI,. &apos;weak&quot;,.... etc.   This position is not satisfactory, and is, we are;qphvinced, in many cases a reflection on,the conditions., of. local organisation.&quot;Bo less important is the question of the present divisions, ;if we are in the future.to have active directing districts, based on the leading industrial centres, such as are outlined in the Theses.   The present divisions take their origin from circumstances attached to the formation of the party which no longer hold good. They are geographical in character, and rather represent lines drawn on a map than the necessarily best massing of our actual membership, for effective directions.   This question will receive pur very careful attention in consultation with the present Divisions,&quot;The present Constitution follows traditional socialist lines f and is -put ofi harmony with the new needs. It is throughout federal in character and does not allow for the development of strong directing bodies, national or district. In accordance with our Terms of Reference, we shall present to the Annual Conference such proposals as may seem necessary for the new Constitution,&quot;Absence of Direction of ActIvities reaohes its height with regard to work in Trade ;U.nions - probably the&apos; principal work before the Party in this oountry at present and so far absolutely unorganised by the Party as a whole. Districts have done good work in many bases, but it is impossible for the districts to take the place of the Centre and give a national lead.   Communists in the same union indifferent parts of the country are not in touch with what one another are doing, and so are unable to combine their forces; and examples could be quoted of
the disastrous results of this-.    It is clear that this situation must be remedied, if; the: Party is to make headway, The only solution is a system of working committees for the Trade Unions, as for other activities, both nationally and by districts to ensure that the. work ,1s covered.&quot;At the present time there is a very widespread lack of understanding of our policy and methods of organisation on the part of many members of the Party.   No future organisation will be successful.; if, it is not based on a , .  real conscious under standing, among; our members.   This will not be achieVad&apos; by&apos; the exist ingi: economies and industrial history classes.   We need regular training in Party Policy and methods of work and - organisation for all new members. When hew, developments of Party Policy take place, instruction throughout the Party should be equally organised.&quot;The first necessity of a Party is a powerful press, &apos;  &quot;VEhV communist despite incidental bril3Jance has not yet , , , . really served the purpose of a Party Organ.   Despiteits large circulation it has not been able to build up the - Party, or to convert -its non-Par ty readers into members...&apos; &quot;The Party organ has not been treated as a separate ..... business enterprise, and its genuine sales circulation has never baen investigated.   The proportion of excess copies printed, and of returns, is very large:   and in addition, a large number of the copies which are hot, returned are not paid for, since :,the money&apos;owing for *Communists&apos; reaches the&apos; endrmous&apos;figure of  2,400.: (March i92 ).   We. wish to call the attention of every branch to this figure whioh is a disgrace to the Party. , , f &quot;&quot;The propaganda of the Party has been left, in the main, to the individual speaker.    It is an essential part of the campaign force of the Party that the principal contents of our propaganda-from day to day and in&apos;each type of activity should be always carefully worked out, so that every speaker speaks with the full authority of the Party,&quot;future Heeds;&quot;From the above considerations it is clear what is the work before us.(ll   We need to strengthen the local units of organisation,(S)   We need to settle the best districts for effective district direction.(3)   We need to settle the best method of election of the Exeoutive to secure a national directing body.(4)   We need to re-organise Headquarters so as to make it a directing centre of all the party&apos;s activities.(5)   We need to work out the methods of organising our activities (on the lines of group and nucleus work) and seeing to their direction.(6)   We need a revised Constitution and a Party Programme.(7)   We need to organise Party training,
(8)   We need to brings the Party Press and propaganda into Closer organised contact with the Party.&quot;These points will he the subject matter of our future reports.   In our first Report we hare cleared the ground.   We have Secured the agreement of , the Bxecutive to our oritioisms, which will form the basis of., future . proposals.   We have dealt with the financial situation. And we have made some beginnings with minor, administrative changes at Headquarters,; and the; introduction of voluntary help and controlling committees subject to the sub-E. C.&quot;In conclusion we wish to appeal to members to beware of letting their present energies slacken in view of future re-organising,   The essential thing now is to maintain the Party active in the present difficult periods Re-organisation is bound to be. a&apos;slow process:   and it should come to help present work, not to impede it.   We would warn branches and divisions against casual and separate schemes of ro-organisation, pending the adoption  , of a uniform plan.     We would also warn them against letting criticism and discussion of present methods diminish our energies on present activities.   Whatever criticism or changes may have to be made, the present need is for the fullest and most loyal co-operation of all members in the immediate work.   We are confident that if we all put our best energies into the task before us, then, with our past experience to guide and help us and the clearer conception we are now reaching of Communism &apos; and Communist practice, we shall in the very hear future, make a great drive forward, to develop the power, influence and leadership of the Party in this, country, and to justify, the high hopes that have been held-by the Communist International.n
