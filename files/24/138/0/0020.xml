(THIS VOCUMjSST IS&apos;THS PROPERTY OF HIS BHITAHMIO MAJSSTTS GOvTSRNMBIflT). S E C. 5 U,o,p. 4120. o 11 inn.IRELAMP   COMPEKS ATI OH POP MALICIOUSiKJURISS: TO HTCPPRTT: ..ftraft letter, to the Provisional Government.(Circulated at the roguest of the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies).Sir,His Majesty&apos;s Government have lately given anxious consideration to certain insistent questions of difficulty arising out of the arrangements made for the payment of compensation to persons who havo suffered in Southern Ireland injuries that would normally have entitled them to compensation under the Criminal injuries Acts. They faol sure that the same urgent problems must havo forced themselves upon the attention of the Provisional Government.     They desire me, therefore, to oommunioate with you fully on the subject.As the cutoome of an agreement betwoen the two Governments in January last, the Compensation (Ireland) Commission has been established under the Chairmanship of Lord Shaw of Dunfermllne to deal with cases of malicious injury to property sustained between January 21st   1919, and July 11th, 1921. His Majesty&apos;s Government understand that nino caseg of considerable variety have been heard and decided by this Commission,..and that these have created precedents which should lead to the settlement, without difficulty and probably without formal hearing, of a much greater number.      They understand also that steps have already been taken by the Commission, with the help of the Provisional Government, for the appointment of agents who will investigate outstanding cases locally, and will be empowered to settle them without delay in so far as the compensation to be awarded may be agreed.      This procedure is entirely in accord   with the   understanding reached in January last.        On   the   other   hand the
inevitable delay in starting to dispose of claims on this agreed system has naturally oaused apprehension and some-times hardship amongst those whose claims await settlement. While the two Governments share the ultimate responsibility for meeting the financial charge involved, the immediate power of resolving those anxieties must in the circumstances rest primarily with the Provisional Government.     They have under-taken to pay in the first instance awards made by the-Commission or arising out of decrees previously given by the Courts in defended cases, and they alone can&apos; seoure to the Officers of the Crown facilities for the prompt and unhampered performance of their duties.     His Majesty&apos;s Government believe that the fullest assistance is being given to the Compensation Commission by the Provisional Government.     They desire, however, to be in a position authoritatively to relieve the anxiety of those who from time to time approach them as jointly responsible with tho Provisional Government for the performance of the January agreement.     They vsould,, therefore, welcome an early official assurance that payment has actually been made in all oases that have matured for payment and,will be made in outstanding-cases, as these are determined or agreed. They, would also be glad of a likS assuranoe as to the progress of the ?;ork of local investigation,,It waa also agreed in January last that claims in respeot of malicious injuries, whether to person or pr opertyj sustained after, July 11th, 1921,-should be dealt with in the usual way by the County Courts and discharged by the local authorities.   That decision was reached in the hope that a resumption of normal civil life in Ireland would allow such claims to be readily&apos; presented by the individual,- heard in the course of ordinary business by the  iourt and paid by the local authorities within whoso areas the injuries, had been committed.    In practice thisresumption
resumption ox peaceful life has been delayed by persons acting in defiance of the Provisional Government, v/hose challenge to its authority has recently, after long forbearance, been met by force of arms.     froia this delay have followed two consequences vitally affecting the arrangement made in January for the compensation of persons who have sustained injuries since the uTude of &quot;July 11th of last year.The most striking of these consequences has lain in the v^hosesale destruction of Irish prq^arty, the numerous , injuries to Irish citizens, which have been inflicted during the fighting which began a month ago, and is in progress at the date of this despatch.     His Majesty^ Government observe that an official notice was published in the Dublin Gazette of July 11th, inviting those, who have sustained loss to their&apos;-property on or since June 27th in the course of the military operations of the Hational Army, to lodge with the Provisional Government particulars of their claims,-     They infer from this notice that the Provisional Governmant have been moved,to contemplate the settlement of this largo body of claims on a national rather than on a.-local basis.     V/hile, however, the responsibility for meeting these claims to compensation must rest upon the Irish Government, ri&apos;is Majestyrs Government cannot divest themselves,, of a duty to see that such claims are met-equitably &apos;and as promptly as inevitable difficulties allow.     They would, therefore, be glad if the Provisional Government would inform them fully and authoritative-ly of the measures which they are adopting to meet these exceptional claims in,respect of injuries whether to person or property.A second consequence ox.the delay in the return
to normal conditions in Southern Ireland has also engagedthe anxious consideration of His Majesty1 s Government.,A number of oases have como to their notico of personswho have suffered malicious injury to person and propertysince July 11th of last year, but who have been deterred    orprevented by the very causes which led up to the recent fighting from prosecuting their lawful claims in the normal suchway.     In some/cases, though notices have been lodged, tho Courts have been unable to sit and deal with them*    In others, the injured party has been deterred from giving notice of claim for fear of prejudicing thereby, before order should be restored, the welfare or safety of Li&amp;celx&apos; or of kinsmen who have remained in Ireland,    prominent &amp;mcr.g these latter cases are those of men lately serving in the Royal Irish Constabulary who. have been, murdered or otherwise injured in person or property by criminals inspired by motives of revenge towards their victims and ill-will towards the provisional Government.    In this matter also His Majesty&apos;s Government feel that they have a like in-alienable responsibility.    Iphoy are led to believe, by the indication of policy contained in the published notice of July 11th as well as by the prompt and. considerate answer made to their representations of May 13th on behalf of persons who had boon compelled to floe from Ireland, that the Provisional Government will not have boon slow to take such cases into account and to considor whether it may not be neoessary to devise some special procedure for dealing with them, in order to secure the end upon Which the two Covsm-ments reached agreement last January.    They hope that the Provisional Government may, therefore, already be in a position to indicate to them some special and affective measure for dealing with such cases, so that they may in their turn been abled...
enabled to reassure those who have appealed to them in respect of injuries suffered since the Truce but otherwise than in the course of the recent open fightingsI am to add that His Majesby-s Government will be happy to consult immediately with representatives of the Provisional Government should it appear that such consultation would accelerate a solution of these urgeab difficulties.    They propose to lay the terms of thta letter-before parliament in due course as an indication of their policy in reply to the many petitioners who have urgentlyapproached them and to whose losses and sufferings lt3 &quot; e n qu i r i es re la te.     The y ho p e to re c e i ve the r ep ly of t he Provisional Government    in a form which will enable it to be laid before Parliament.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Whitehall Gardens, S.W.
