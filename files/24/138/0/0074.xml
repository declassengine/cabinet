This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.3SECRET.CP. 4174.THE CABINET.REPORT ON THE SITUATION IN IRELAND FOR THE WEEKENDING 26th AUGUST, 1922.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate the report on the Irish situation by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Ireland, for the week ending 26th August, 1922.L. W.-E.The Wis Office,2nd September, 1922.Southern Ireland.(a) Dublin. The preliminary funeral ceremonies for General Collins have attracted many thousands of people both to the City Hall for the lying-in-state and along the route taken by the procession at the different moves of the body.The further postponement of the meeting of the Dail till 9th September has caused no surprise.On 24th August a lorry containing British troops, with its escort consisting of a Rolls Royce armoured car, was ambushed on the outskirts of Dublin on its way to Collinstown. Two bombs were thrown by the attackers, who also employed revolver and gun fire. Fire was returned, with what result is not known ; there were no British casualties. The armoured car received slight injuries. The matter has been fully reported to the Provisional Government.Considerable firing continues to take place at night in Dublin, the causes being &quot; attacks &quot; by Republicans on the barracks, posts and sundry guards of the Provisional Government troops.The policy of the Republicans appears to be one of harassing their oj)components by occasional shots, thereby creating an atmosphere of tension and allowing the guards and sentries no rest, as from the noise it appears that frequently the whole guard turns out to reply to the &quot; occasional&apos;&apos; shot.On the evening of the 26th August two civilians wei*e conveyed in a large car outside the town limits and shot by the roadside. A third who was also seen in another car has since been found shot beside the road in another neighbourhood.(&amp;) Outside Dublin. On 22nd August. General Collins, while travelling in Co: Cork, was ambushed by Republicans at Bealnablatha, about 8 miles north of Ban don. The General and the escort left their lorries, lined the ditches and replied to the (ire of the attackers. The fight lasted over an hour. General Collins was shot through the forehead near its conclusion and died immediately. There was only one other casualty amongst the Provisional Government troops.On 24th August, Provisional Government troops effected a landing at Kinsale and met with only slight resistance.On 25th August two British officers and their escort were attacked while drawing pay for the Berehaven garrison from the bank at Castletown, the attackers numbered between &quot;40 and 30. Fire was returned, one officer Lieutenant Symons, R.G.A. was wounded and one of the attackers Commandant Dwyer is believed seriously wounded. Later, when the party were leaving the shore, they were again fired on and a bombardier
was wounded and the mate of the launch &quot; Cambridge.&quot; Fire was returnee! and due attacker was hit. No money was lost, though one revolver was dropped when the officer was wounded, and the revolver of one of the attackers was captured. Canon Hays, parish priest of Castletown who was passing at the time, was wounded in the arm by a stray bullet.Several ambushes of and attacks on Provisional Government troops and convoys are reported from the south-western area.On 25th August, H.M.S. &quot; Truro &quot; was fired on by rifles when in Killary Bay, Co. Mayo ; fire was returned with Lewis gun and two rounds 12-pounder. There were no British casualties.The rounding-up and dispersal of the Republicans north and north-east of Dundalk by the Provisional Government iOrces continues.Individual Republicans are returning over the border into Ulster, but until they reach their homes, where they are known to the police, it is unlikely that any action can be taken. No leaders or prominent men have yet been recognized as recently returned to their homes in Ulster, though a number of strange men have been observed in and around Belfast.Northern Ireland. The situation in the Six Counties remains imchanged.In Belfast, during the period under review, there has been one case of bomb throwing and an outbreak.of firing in the Marrowbone, Ballymacarret and Grosvenor road areas on 27th August.   No casualties are reported.The inquiry into the ambush of the police and military at Cushendall is now being held.Of the men removed from the Six Counties into Southern Ireland, only seven now remain detained, one Royal Ulster constable and six civilians.Conclusion.In conclusion, apart from purely military aspects, I think it right to place before you my opinion in regard to the general state of Ireland.At the present moment, the situation, so far as it can be seen, both politically and from the military standpoint of the Provisional Government, does not show much improvement.Information is difficult to get on account of the absence of an organized Intelli-gence Service, and the news published in the Press, being heavily censored, in no way represents the actual condition of affairs. At the same time, with the assistance of private information from all over the country that at times comes into my possession,-I am convinced that the Provisional Government&apos;s plan of campaign is making little if any progress. Their troops certainly occupy villages and towns, and the rebel forces, as a rule, put up little or no defence, but disperse only to ambush the Provisional Government troops when pursued, while the canqoaign of well-conceived assassination is becoming daily more marked, and, in my opinion, may, during the next few weeks, increase beyond anything that has happened yet in this country.In the capital itself heavy firing goes on nightly, though no great damage is clone ; murders are committed in and about the town, reminiscent of those which used to be perpetrated upon the police and military until more severe measures were taken in the early part of 1921 ; roads and railways are daiby blown up and disorganized throughout the country, and, up to the present, there is not the least indication, although a great deal of talk, of any active assistance by the population on behalf of the Provisional Government troops.It is quite true that the Provisional Government have been in a better position than were the British troops, on account of the information which has been more freely given to them, but during the last few weeks a series of assassinations have taken place which point strongly to the fact that the rebels are. emulating the former methods of terrifying all sections of the population in order to prevent information being given.In several conversations I had with the late General Collins I impressed upon him the necessity for stern and drastic action against those who used methods of assassination towards his Government and troops ; but he appeared to hold the view that in Ireland such methods only lead to the creation of martyrs and - further increase of strength to the opposing side. This theory may be true up to a certain point ; but that point has now been passed, as is evident in the cases of Boland and Cathal Brugha, who memory is practically effaced at the present moment, and who, except in the extreme rebel Press, are forgotten.
The policy of de Valera at the present moment is quite evident, i.e., to press to the utmost the advantage his Party have gained by the disappearance of Arthur Griffith and Michael Collins, and thus reduce the whole country to a state of terrified impotence. Unless I am very much mistaken, a wave of assassinations may take place in the near future which will probably have the result of making the Provisional Government come to terms with certain of their political opponents who are even, for reasons of their own, more strongly opposed to drastic measures, and the chaos that at present exists in Ireland will become greater.It is well. to bear one important factor clearly in mind when dealing with the inhabitants of Southern Ireland, and that is that under no conditions whatever will they do anything to assert themselves where danger is involved. They will talk, they will write to the papers, but they will not physically assert themselves to support the forces of their Government. The action which is taken by these forces, in spite of the often absurd accounts that appear daily in the Press, is feeble in the extreme. Accounts appear daily of encounters lasting many hours, of dashing gallantry on the part of the Provisional Government troops : but the result is always the same possibly one or two killed or wounded and the escape of the rebels without leaving any trace of casualties. By comparison with the experience of the British troops before the truce, one is able to gauge fairly well what actually occurs on such occasions. Time and again, when small parties of British troops encountered the rebels, considerable authenticated casualties were suffered by the latter, and a determined attitude by even the smallest parties of British troops invariably settled the matter in a comparatively short time. Again, from the experience gained before July, 1921, one fact came prominently to notice, and that was that as soon as really drastic measures were taken, such as the strict imposition of martial law and the application of drumhead courts-martial, the rebel activities crumbled away. Unfortunately, for various reasons these activities were limited to the last two months before the Truce.I mention this merely for the purpose of pointing out that until and unless the Provisional Government are prepared to take equally drastic measures they will not only never overcome the campaign of intensive guerilla warfare and studied assassination, but they will lose what little confidence the public now has in them, and the country will be reduced to such a state as to be far beyond the powers of the Provisional Government to remedy.The jDossible entry of the Labour Party and men like Larry 0&apos;Neill, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, into the political arena will be a danger of the first magnitude, as their presence will weaken the Government and lead them to a policy of accommodation and conciliation which will only serve to strengthen the hands of the extremists and encourage them to increase the methods of terrorism on which they rely.As regards the. British troops now in Dublin, although at the moment they are on good terms with the well-clisposed portion of the population, there are clear indications that attacks upon them are part of the programme of the rebel extremists in the hope that if they become embroiled in the struggle the adherents of the Provisional Government will join the extremists against a common enemy. Unfortunately, the discipline and lo3&apos;alty of a large percentage of the Provisional Government troops, and the hopeless ignorance of their officers, give good grounds to the extremists for thinking that this policy may be successful.Finally, I would impress upon the Government that the position is one which at any moment may require far more firm and drastic measures than those now being taken to cope with it.C. F. jST. MACREADY, General,Commanding-in - Chief, Ireland.General Headquarters, Dublin.29th August, 1922.
