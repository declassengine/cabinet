SECRET.C.P.-4138.CABINS T*THE    irish situation,I oirculate a Memorandum which I havo reoeivedfrom a responsible source.(Initialled)      WVS0CCOLONIAL OS1?ICS, 31st July, 1922.MEMORANDUM CM IRSLiSD.,The history of all revolutions is repeating itself In Ireland and the leaders who were united to obtain a common objective are now ready to rend each other in order tp secure power.The Government have a vague war policy but absolutely no oivil polioy.     The departmental functions of Government have ceased and the excuse is made rwa are too busy helping in the war&apos; ,     No one knows when the Tail will assemble and I think it can bo taken for granted that tho opening will be delayed as long as possible.   .The Government have ma.de a g/aite unnecessary rupture with Labour whioh has completely undermined the strong position they held after the elections.     All the Labour members elected were pro-Treaty as also Were the Independents.     The position of the Parties then was 92 pro-Treaty, 36 Anti-Treaty.    The position to-day is -Against the Government For the Govomment.36 Republicans 58 Free Staters17 Labour53Balance of power ** 17 Independents.Alt bo ugh...
Although I have stated the number of Government supporters at 58 I think it will be found when the Dail assembles that at least 10 and probably 20 will have loft them for the sole reason that they realise the Government is incapable of forming a construct!vo policy.     I am, however, d-oing all I can to secure the support both of Labour and independents to keep the Government in power until the Treaty and Constitution are ratified.     The next election should sweep them from power providing a suffioient number of business candidates come forward.prdminan&apos; members Of the Republican Party realise that the Irish people do not want a Republic, and some will not stand at the no ct election.     They hold that Republicans have not a. chance of winning and having made their protest should now abandon the struggle.     While most of the Republican members of the Dail now with the rebels share this view their loyalty to De Valera prevents them giving up the struggle until he says the word.      Tho: Lord Mayor of Cork, a strong Republican, went to de Valera on -27th inst., but has no hope of success.All the Ministers of the Government blocks a point of calling at a house in Ely place,&apos;st* Stephen1s Green, every evening..       They discuss matters without reserves     This has been the custom for over a year.     I had a long talk with their host on the 24th Inst., and asked him to tell me quite frankly what Ms opinion was after the, unique opportunity he had had of observing the members of the Cabinet individually and collectively.       Ho summed it up in the ono sentence &quot;They arc a hopeless crowd&quot;. -.I find it quite impossible to get the members of the Provisional Government to concentrate their minds on anyconstructive.,.,
construetivo projects.     Mr. Desmond FitzGerald,&apos;who is Director of Publicity and Propaganda for the provisional Government, realised that it sight load to an earlier cassation Of hostilities if instead of concentrating on War Progress Bulletins, an endeavour was made to prepare civilian.cii.cb for public worts of national and. Municipal importance that could employ many thousands of men for soeial yearsv giving, publicity to the fact that these enterprises are he 3d up sololy through hostilities and, that they will be put in operation when peace is declared.      I pointed out to him that it was not bullets or bayonets that, made a ccuntry-great, but industry send trade.,     But ho could think of nothing except propaganda, and although Mr. Griffith at a subsequent inter-view at which tho Deputy lord Mayor of Cork was, present said the advice was sound and an endeavour would bo made to carry it out, I faal that, like many previous promises, nothing will bo done.Individual Members of the administration all wait on Mr. Collins,.. who, besides being Chairman of tho provisional . Government, is Minister of Finance and Commander-in-Chief of tho Army.     Mr* Cosgravo, who is acting as Chairman of the Provisional Government in his absence, when asked to push forward so ma constructive questions, replied pathetically &quot;I havo had two telaphono calls, within an hour from the Commander-in-chief.   How can one give attention to son-struotivo matters under such conditions.&quot;     Tho Ministers resent all advice as interference.     They think themselves quite competent to daal with all matters that&apos; arise.;    but in point of fact nothing, is being done.      I am unable, to understand how such, a big movement as Sinn Foin can ba led by suoh small men. ...Substantial people in Dublin and elsewhere realise that there can bo no pea eve under the existing regime and that unless.. . .
unless there is s one - intervention of fofco the Country willbo bled white..     A member of the Ball said last week-&quot;The English had the&apos; capacity to govern us but not the will. We have the will but not the&apos; -capacity.&quot;
