THE COMMUNISTSThe Fourth Congress of the Third International is to be opened in Moscow on November 7th:     the Secretary of the - Executive&apos; Council:. hag &apos; invited&apos; ten delegates, including representatives,.of..the^Toung Communist League and the Women1s Section, to attend from England &quot;if possible with legal passports&quot;.Cant has. reported to He ad quarters that there is &quot;a steady increase.in membership throughout the London and Home Counties Division in spite of continued unemployment&quot;.On July 15th the London Divisional Council considered its relationship with the unemployed and decidea that Where branches were doing good &quot;work there should be no cessation in1 this sphere of their&apos;activity:   on the other hand the number of party members engaged in.Work among the unemployed was out of proportion to the results so far obtained anS the organiser was instructed to transfer certain members to other departments of communist work.The Communist party has restarted the issue of fortnightly &quot;points for Speakers&quot;: these are &quot;designed not only to convey information of matters of immediate and general interest but also to assist propagandists In the presentation of the Party case&quot;.

more intellectual communists are prepared to go for propaganda material:&quot;SCHEME OF INVEST IGiT ION INTO COLONIAL&quot;la the discussion of the Programme Commission Comrade Bukharln stressed the great importance of the 0.1. classifying the countries of the world as:-Agrarian,     Industrial,     Colonial,     etc.and studying them by groups at the several phases of their development within, the capitalist economy.     The CI. has been very much concerned with what they oall the &apos;Colonial Question&apos; and one of the themes for special consideration at the Fourth Congress is&apos; &apos; The Eastern&apos;Que sti on&quot;Now, there is no country in the whole world where these two questions can be so thoroughly examine as in Great Britain where, in London, are the acc-umula archives of the Empire - the Colonies, the Dependencies and the Indian Empire.     Here, and at the Universities and in the great libraries of Manchester, Liverpool. Edinburgh and Glsgow, - there Is an immense volume of material in- documents, government papers, learned and trade publications ana books from which, given a corps of trained investigators and adequate resources, in a few years&apos; time, could be abstracted the most invaluable statistical and other economic and historlo&amp;l data concerning the whole trend:, of British, French, American, Japanese.&quot;Imperial Expansion.   There is available in:&apos;   The Registry of Wills,The Registry of Joint Stock Companies,-   The Government Libraries,The Record Office,The Imperial Institute,The British Muse-urn,The Institutions of the Learned Societies,documentary and published material oovering the whole period of capitalist expansion.&quot;To explore capitalist imperialism in a systemati manner, we must employ the Marxian method of histories enquiry.     We must divide the world up into spheres and put men to work upon those areas.&quot;In the Registry of the Joint Stock Companies, alone, there are the annual returns of all the limited liability companies registered in. Great Britain and   Ireland, operating at home and abroad, \   within the last 65 years. -   Often I find it necessary to search a share list of the early seventies when writing an article on some phase of Imperialism.&quot;Some of our less well-known comrades could easily be set to work in Government offices, libraries to which their university conneotions would give them/
them ready access/    Others could and should he sent to Washington, to Harvard. Columbia and other great economic research schools of the United States there, to do the work nominally as graduates preparing for further degrees, but, really to do work for the Comintern.&quot;There ere certain aspects of capitalism at home and abroad which the Comintern should empower and instruct the CP. of G.B. to have under taken:-X.     &quot;There Is the&apos; organisation, the development up-to-date and the future tendencies in certain great industries such as:-(&amp;)-&apos; The Grain Trade and Growing, fbj   The Goal Industry. )   The Petroleum Supply. Sea Transport/-&apos;     ; Land   Transport, etc., etc.(elS.     &quot;There are the opening up by capital methods of employing that capital, Interests in which that capital is employed, conflict of capital, assistance by national governments to competing capitals in certain important, spheres of ^imperial - eatpioitabioh. v.- . &apos;&quot;Kotably, these areas need systematic historical *,* v and contemporary study:-ip&apos;     (a)   India, Burma, Ceylon, Malay States (we may call theses * Greater India1 ). &apos;(b) The Ottoman Empire (as it was in the middle ;   of the 19th century);   its provinces in I   disintegration (Balkan States, Greece. Asia; f   Minor Provinces, Syria, ;1 Egypt. Arabia)..(c) Persia and the Border Territories of Afghanistan, Baluohistan, etc(d) China.&apos;e) The Ihitch and other Fast Indian Islands.( Central and Bast Africa,g) South Africa and Rhodesia.rhj West Africa.i) French and Italian Colonies In Africa.$ Argentina and Brazil.:k) The Negro States, Liberia, West India Isles,f 1) Mexico and Central America.&quot;As nearly all these are zones - very important Stones of British capitalist investment, we have here in our great cities the essential facts! about their economic potentialities, their economic and political history, their real Owners.&quot;I urge particularly that (1) those industries vital to the economic diplomacy and statecraft of Soviet Russia - the grain, timber, foodstuffs and oil and machinery industries - should be investigated.    (2)   those industries vital to the rationing of the European proletariat.   (3)   those areas such as   The Near Fast, China, India, Argentina, about which the capitalist powers are already or about to quarrel or from which, asin/
in the case of India or Algeria, one or other of them draws the wealth on which its eoonomio power is built.&quot;I urge the CP. of G.B. to recognise its responsibility in these matters to the C.I. to realis that Great Britain is the economic and political centre of a system of devastating exploitation, increasingly menaoing to its own proletariat as well ae degrading to: tbe peasantry and, tribal peoples of the Bast and of Africa;   to ask the C.I. to be instructed and given the facilities to undertake its task of exploring the intricacies and thoroughly examining int* the power of British. American and Japanese capital.&quot;THE YOUMO COMMUHIST LEAGtTBfhe first annual conference of the Young Communist league of Great Britain is to be held in London on August 5th:   Moscow ics particularly interested in this meeting and on July  Oth and 22hd the Executive Committee of the Young Communist International sent, over the signature of Ziegler, detailed instructions, a draft programme and a manifesto. From these documents it appears that there will be more thanfc one Moscow delegate at the conference who will see that it follows the required lines.Tho following extracts are translated from the General Inetructions&quot;Every year many tens of thousands of young workeri don the naval and military uniform of His Majesty the King.     Why do young workers join the Forces?   They give.health and life to fight for the interests of the Kingdom.   They help the factory owners to earn more by lowering the standard of the workers in India, Afrioa and many other Colonies, and even attack their comrades on strike in Great Britain with naked weapons at the wJJ of the industrialists and tho royal government.     They are induced ,.by false , representations to * fight against their own, class.   Yqu must open-the eyes of your young comrades;in the Forces and teach them that now the proletariat must carry arms &quot;but only for one fight * the fight against exploiters and oppressors, against capitalists...     Look across to Ireland, where thousands of young proletarians are sacrificing their possessions and their lives in the fight for freedom of the Irish revolutionaries.     Stretch out the hand of brotherhood 1 to those young comrades. &quot; Organise,them and teach them that there is only one way in which their freedom, lise yours, can be attained * the overthrow of capitalist domination and the establishment of proletarian rule.Look/
Look across to South Africa, to India and to Egypt, where young natives in communist groups are combining with revolutionaries ana fighting against English imperialism.   They also are your brothers and comrades and with them also you must work hand in hand... England is one of the chief stronghoias of international capitalism.     You-, young English comrades, are living in the heart of the English Colossus whose grasping arms are stretched over the whole earth.    You can work your way    \ into factories, regiments and ships, in short, into the arteries of the great Empire and prepare to break asunder the chains with which English imperialism has bound millions of workers throughout the world.&quot;The draft programme does not contain much new matterbut one quotation will serve to emphasise the detailedinterest which Moscow is taking in the Young CommunistLeague:&quot;Anti-militarist struggle - Bnglish militarism and ^arinismus&apos; - Soldiers&apos; Councils, class and imperial war, the arming of the proletariat - communist propaganda amongst conscripts inside and outside barracks.&quot; ; .James Stewart has asked the Youth Section of the Lithuanian Communist 1*0deration of Great Britain to send a delegate to the conference and has. offered to pay the fare.The circulation of &quot;Tho Young Communist&quot; is at present about 4,500 a month.TEE RED IHTEillLiTlOiTAL Off LABOUR &apos; PHIQMSThe British Bureau of the Rea International of Labour Unions is making extensive preparations for the provincial conferences in September,     Invitations are to be sent to branches of mining, railv/ay, engineering, transport, shop assistants&apos;, furnishing traaes&apos;, sailors&apos;, electricians&apos;, builders&apos;, dock, distributive and general workers&apos; unions..Harry Webb has reported that a good response has been made to the circular sent recently to members of the National Union of Railwaymen and that a meeting of selected party members in that Union is being held.Harry Pollitt has returned to this country and is takingan active interest in &quot;The worker&quot;, which is now beingsubsidised:   efforts are being made to increase Itscirculation/

Liam MacGille, Ioea of the Scots National League, is active in the- matter and has sent copies of the petition to brano of the League in Scotland.A *Daily Herald&quot; report says that Radek and Bucharin, the Communist International Executive Delegates at the Berlin Conference of the Three Internationale, have sent an open letter t Messrs.
