[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.jPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1922.SECRET.CP. 4154.CABINET,SPECIAL   KEPORT   ON    UNEMPLOYMENT,-No. 72.   WEEK  ENDED  AUGUST 4,  1922.THE SITUATION. Some slight improvement in the engineering industry is reported from the Midlands and North-Eastern Divisions, although generally there would appear to be no material change for the better.In the iron and steel industry there is a further slight improvement in the Midlands, but unemployment in the industry has increased in the North-Eastern Division. The improvement previously reported in Wales is not likely to be great for many months to come.Coal mining remains at a very low ebb, although some increased activity is reported from certain centres, notably the North-Eastern Division, in consequence of the present demand for British coal in the United States. A small improvement is reported in the Midlands Division.There is no material change in the position of the shipbuilding industry generally, but slightly increased activity is apparent in the North-Eastern Division,Improvement in the woollen and worsted industry is maintained, especially in the North-Eastern Division. Employment in the cotton and textile industry remains good in Scotland, but in the North-Western Division the outlook at present, except in the fine spinning section of the industry, is not so good as was expected.Some slight improvement in the building trade is shown in the South-Western Division, but great depression is still maintained generally.Employment in the confectionery trade in the North-Eastern Division is very good.   A general slump is, however, reported in the clothing trade.Increased unemployment in the brick and cement trade is reported from the South-Western Division and in the London Division.In the South-Western Division there is an improvement in the boot and shoe industry, which also continues fairly steady in the Midlands.Unemployment has increased in the glass trade in the North-Eastern Division.The tinplate trade in South Wales has shown some slight improvement, but the copper and spelter industry in that Division still remains at a very low ebb.A great improvement in the fishing industry is reported from the Stornoway District, where all the curers are working fully staffed.
In the rubber, hatting and slipper manufacturing trades in the North-Western Division, all the workpeople are fully employed.The lace trade in the South-Western Division is in a very precarious state,and further discharges are expected. Division is, however, slightly better.The position of this industry in the MidlandsT. J. MACNAMARA,Ministry of LabourNOTE ON UNEMPLOYMENT  SITUATION IN GREAT BRITAIN ANDIRELAND ON AUGUST 4, 1922.1. The Trade Union figure of unemployment for July 1914 was 2-8 per cent.The average for the ten years prior to the war, according to Trade Union unemployment figures, was 4-7 per cent. It was as high as 7-8 per cent, in 1908 and 7-7 per cent, in 1909.During 1919 it ranged between 1-6 per cent, in September and 3-2 per cent, in December, and averaged 2-4 per cent, for the year.During 1920 it ranged between 0-9 per cent, in April and 6-0 per cent, in December, and averaged 2-4 per cent, for the year.The figures for 1921 wereTo the end of January ...

Workpeople who are unable so to comply are excluded.I.-SUMMARY OF ACTION TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT.[From Autumn 1920 onwards.]Cabinet Unemployment Committee.The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, there was a special discussion at a meeting of the Cabinet, when the Cabinet Unemployment Committee was appointed to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the 8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit, extended the periods of benefit and increased the contributions. As from November 1921 the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision for grants in respect of wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed a special levy to provide for these grants. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, which operates as from the 6th April, 1922, amalgamates the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment Insurance contributions, and extends until June 1923 the special periods during which &quot; uncovenanted &quot; benefit may be drawn. The authority to borrow money from the Treasury is increased to  30,000,000 for Great Britain.Table showing amount paid out in Unemployment Benefit (including Benefit in respect of Dependants) and the Contributions during the period November 8, 1920, to July 29, 1922.

Numbers receiving Unemployment Benefit and Numbers on Short Time inGreat Britain.The number of persons paid benefit during the week ended the 31st July was 937,459* wholly unemployed and 26,404 on part-time.
(B.) Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Report. At least 250,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 92,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits and Trade Facilities Act schemes (see table below).SUMMARY SHOWING THE LABOUR EMPLOYED IN GREAT BRITAIM AT JULY 28, 1922, ON CERTAIN OF THE SCHEMES REFERRED TO ABOVE.Scheme.
