attacked the towns of Bantry and Macroom. The attacks failed in both cises. Several conflicts between Provisional Government troops and irregulars are reported in the press, in which the former are said to have inflicted casualties on and captured arms from the irregulars.Ulster. In Belfast there has been a recrudescence of shooting and bomb throwing, the casualties for the week being Killed.    Wounded.Protestants    ...       ...       ...       ...       ...... 2Roman Catholics       ...       ...       ...       ...     2 10Soldiers ...       ...       ...       ...       ...   ... 1Total      ...       ...      ...     2 13On 27th August three men of the 1st Bn. Norfolk Regiment were held up by two armed men. One of the soldiers was fired at and wounded in the wrist. No political importance is attached to this occurrence, which is attributed to individual spite against the soldier shot.It is difficult to draw any definite conclusions from the present confused state of affairs. There is no doubt that both sides are suffering considerably more casualties than was the case 6 weeks ago, and the number of unaccountable shootings is on the increase.It is important to bear in mind that the dividing line between the adherents of the Provisional Government and the irregulars is by no means clearly defined. &quot; Free Staters &quot; and &quot; Republicans &quot; are misnomers, and no effort is spared to avoid using these terms by the Provisional Government, who refer to their own troops as National Forces and their opponents as irregulars.Among the prominent leaders it is probable that Arthur Griffith was the only genuine Free Stater ; the remainder, and the bulk of that section of the Irish Republican Army who proved loyal to the Provisional Government, merely accept the treaty as a stepping-stone to the realization of their full ideal of a republic, and in response to the almost universal desire of the general public for peace, together with, in some cases, the advance of personal interests.That the leaders of the Provisional Government and &quot; National Forces &quot; have in no way abandoned their full ideal is shown not only in the news sheets published almost daily by the republican propagandists, but in the utterances and actions of the members of the Provisional Government themselves. In a speech to the Provisional Government troops at Limerick after requiem mass for Michael Collins, Eoin 0&apos;DufFy, the Commander of the Southern and Western Commands, scouted the idea that their dead Commander-in-Chief was other than a republican, and referred to him as the &quot; greatest republican of them all(vide Appendix I (A)). A letter from Rory 0&apos;Connor (which apparently evaded the prison censors) throws an interesting light on the attitude adopted by Richard Mulcahy during the negotiations between the leaders of the &quot; National Forces &quot; and of the irregulars, during the efforts made for &quot; unity of the army &quot; prior to the recent elections. It shows also the attitude adopted by both sections in relation to Ulster (vide Appendix I (B)).This letter was published in &quot; Freedom,&quot; one of the many republican news sheets sold openly in the streets of Dublin. In spite of the rigorous censorship of the legitimate press, particularly the English press, no attempt is apparently made by the Provisional Government to suppress or stop the sale of these news sheets. It is impossible to believe that those directing the policy of the Provisional Government are so blind or stupid as not to see the effect of this unrestricted distribution of republican propaganda. With every desire on the part of British officers to trust in the policy of the Government, they cannot read these things without doubting the genuineness of the Provisional Government to give effect to that policy.Again, Michael Staines, the commander of the Civic Guard, the future police force of Southern Ireland, voluntarily appeared at the inquest on the murders of two young men who held important posts in the Fianna Eireann, a republican organization, approximating to Boy Scouts, and stated that he knew and liked one of the victims, and was aware that he was an irregular. No steps however appear to have been taken to arrest this young man, who was in a position to instil republican ideals into the minds of a large number of the adolescent youth of Dublin.In Appendix I (D) and (E) are given other extracts which show that the national forces owing allegiance to the Provisional Government still claim to be at the same time
the Irish Republican Army. Republican news sheets have also made, it quite clear that many of the Supreme Council of the Irish Republican Brotherhood hold appointments in, or directly under, the Provisional Government.    during the past 2 months many cases of outrages and assaults on British troops have taken place and have been reported to the Provisional Government. A summary of these incidents is given in Appendix II. In no single instance have the perpetrators of these outrages been brought to book.J. BRIND, Colonel, for General,Commanding-in-Chief, Ireland.

APPENDIX I.(A.)ADDRESS TO THE TROOPS AND CROWD BY GENERAL 0&apos;DUFFY AFTER REQUIEM MASS FOR MICHAEL COLLINS, IN LIMERICK CATHEDRAL, ON 28th AUGUST, 1922.&quot; Freeman&apos;s Journal,&quot; 29th August, 1922.The Man England Feared.&quot; Here, in the shadow of death, I am not going to say anything hard, but I feel this tragedy of the Irish nation in my very soul. They who murdered Mick Collins say they were Republicans. Republicans, my God ! He was the best Republican of them all,&quot; said General 0&apos;Duffy. amid tremendous applause. &quot; He was the only man that England feared. He was the only man that could and would secure the absolute independence of Ireland. He worked for it, he fought for it, and he died for it. The hand that slew Michael Collins has deprived Ireland of her only strength. It has accomplished in one foul blow what the Greenwoods and the Macreadys and others couldn&apos;t&apos;t do. &apos;Tis sad to think, &apos;tis hard indeed to think, that it should be the hand of one of his own countrymen, perhaps one of his own countrymen, and perhaps the hand of someone he rescued from death in a British dungeon. &apos;Tis hard to think that such a person should be responsible for the death of Michael Collins. The dead that died for Ireland will hold him responsible. The living will hold him responsible, and the generations yet unborn will hold him responsible.&quot;(B.)EXTRACT FROM A LETTER FROM RORY 0&apos;CONNOR.&quot; Freedom.&quot;The lies and hypocrisy of the Free State leaders are astounding, especially to those of us here who took part in the Army negotiations to unity, and know the whole inner history of these negotiations.We were never requested to evacuate the Four Courts. On the contrary, at one meeting of the Coalition Army Council, at which Mulcahy, 0&apos;Dnffy, Mellows, Lynch and I were present, we were asked to evacuate the Ballast Office, Kildare Street Club, the Masonic Hall and Lever Brothers premises only, which we agreed to do on condition that the Free State evacuated certain positions they held. At that stage we actually discussed co-ordinated military action against North-East Ulster, and had agreed on an officer to command both Republican and Free State troops in the area. We were also to send from the south some hundreds of our rifles for use in that area. The reason given was, that it would never do if rifles which had been handed to the &quot; Government &quot; for use against the Republic and which of course could be identified were found in use against Craig. An exchange of rifles was effected. It should be remembered that at this time &quot; the Government&quot; was publicly declaring that it was the &quot; mutineer &quot; section of the army which was fighting the Ulster people.At this meeting I have referred to, someone suggested the evacuation of the Four Courts and Mulcahy laughingly said that as long as we held that place, the war against North-East Ulster would be attributed to us. We, of course, had no objection. From this you see the real reason why we were not asked to evacuate the Four Courts.   (We subsequently got 25 minutes to do so.)You see also the double-faced policy of these even towards the people of &quot; Southern Ireland,&quot; &quot; Northern Ireland,&quot; and their allies the British.&apos; (0.)STATEMENT BY ALDERMAM M. STAINE3, T.D., ON 29th AUGUST, 1922, AT THE INQUEST ON JAMES COLE AND LEO COLLEY, MURDERED NEAR THE THATCH, ON 26th AUGUST, 1922.&quot; Irish Independent,&quot; SOth August, 1922.Aid. M. Staines, T.D., intimated that he wished to make&apos;a statement, and on being sworn said he knew young Cole, who was a very bright boy, and witness liked him very much. He knew he was an irregular. Witness was proceeding to say that about a fortnight ago his brother Vincent, who was a comrade of deceased&apos;s, said to witness that young Cole had told him that he was leaving the irregulars, when Mr. Comyn objected that that was not evidence.

Things are much changed since you left here. Then we were fighting the common enemy. Now we are fighting amongst ourselves . . . Weil, Johnny, you over there seem to think, this is a Free State Army that is trying to control Ireland at present, but I say, No ! When we joined tbe army in Drumboe in March we told Joe Sweeney (Commandant, 1st Northern Division) that we were not going to serve in a Free State Army, but the same army under the same G.H.Q , and that was before there was any word of a split in the army.&quot; Then there came into Donegal a band of blackguards from Derry and the south of Ireland, and started to ambush our fellows . . . they killed four of our fellows in Newtowncunningkam (1.H.11), they shot the Captain we had in Buncrana and two in Drumkeen, two in Letterkenny (.1.J.9.) and two in Glenties (3.d.8).&quot; Two months ago we fought the Specials in Belleek and Pettigoe . . . We would have had Derry only for those fools outside our County.&quot; There was only one man in Donegal leading them, that was Peter 0&apos;Donnell, but he said that when the Treaty was signed he was going to start a Communist movement . . . Well, John, do you really think we would fight against a Republic alchough we are in the National Army? . . See if we don&apos;t get a well equipped army and then break out and tell England to go to hell.&quot;Officers and Soldiers Killed, Wounded and Assaulted in Southern Ireland Reported to Provisional Government.Name.Result of action taken by Provisional Government.Private A.
