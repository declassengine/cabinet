(This document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.) SECRET. CABINET.OA  4108. SPECIAL POLICE PROTECTION.Memorandum fey the Home Secretary.I desire to &quot;bring to the notice of the Cabinet the position that has arisen as a result of the decision taken after the assassination of Sir Henry Wilson that special Police protection should be given not only to Ministers but to numerous other persons.Apart from Ministers and persons holding official positions special protection has been given to about a dozen other individuals, and at the present time it has been necessary for the Commissioner to withdraw about 150 men from the Uniform Branch and attach them to the Special Branch for &quot;special protection&quot; duties,Moreover, requests or suggestions with regard to protection are still being received, and numerous so-called &quot;warnings&quot; are being sent to Scotland Yardc    These &quot;warnings&quot; are almost invariably in the shape of anonymous letters from Ireland, and the police have no means of discovering their source or of ascertaining what value should be attached to thenu    The Assistant Commissioner in charge of the Special Branch points out that while anonymous letter-writers abound in ordinary times, in times of crisis they redouble their energy; &quot;and it is common knowledge that anonymous letter writing and anonymous warnings are some of the most primitive methods of antagonistic organizations to &apos;stampede&apos; the police and exhaust their energies in fruitless work, thereby ensuring   better facilities for carrying out some serious attacks.&quot;In these circum^tanoe^ the Commissioner has asked
for instructions as to the amount of protection, if any0 he is to give to persons other than Ministers and persons holding official positions, as if he has to protect all persons whose names may he mentioned to him as in possible danger there would be a risk of undue diversion-of the&apos; Policefrom their proper and raormal duties0It is clear that the special protection of individuals if carried to any length involves an uneconomical distribution of force, and I propose to instruct the Commissioner (l)  to disregard anonymous &quot;warnings&quot; except so far as they may call attention to facts which might have been overlooked and which in themselves constitute a ground for special protection?   (2)  to obtain my special instructions before adding to the list of persons to whom special protection is now being given.I do not propose to give special protection in any more cases unless there is reasonable evidence that the person in question is in danger.    It seems to me clearly impracticable to give special protection to any and every prominent politician or writer who may draw upon himself Irish hostility.17th July, 1922.
