CABINET.SecretM.H.49.C .P .4104 ,Mental Treatment Bill. Memorandum by the Minister of Health.Much public attention has recently been drawn to theproblems of Lunacy Law and administration, and I have been pressed to appoint a Royal Commission to go into the whole question.of ma I--administration were&apos;made by Dr. Montagu Lomax in a published book and I have had these investigated by a Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir Cyril Cobb which Is about to report-. I have other Committees investigating nursing and diet.no present case for a Roysl Commission.     The whole ground was covered by a Roysl Commission, which reported some ten years ago, and a Commission now would be simply a cause of considerable expense and delay in effecting improvement,so far as  I can judge,  there is practical unanimity in favour of amendment.     Such points are -(!)   the advisability of making it obligatory to include women on the Visiting Committees who practically administer the Lunacy Acts.(2) the giving of power to the local authorities which appoint the Committees to include on them a proportion of specially qualified persons not members of the local authorities,(3) the giving of power to a Visiting Committee to exercise its power and duties in combination by agreement with any other Visiting Committee.Tnere is further a strong demand that definite legal provision should be made whereby persons suffering from mentalAs regards lunacy administration, serious allegationsAs regards  the lunacy law, I have thought that there is there are certain points in the lunacy laws on which,
&apos; .    23disorder but not certified under the Lunacy Acts may receive out-patient and in-patient treatment without such certification in public institutions.     Provision of this kind has been legal in.Scotland for fifty years but does not exist In England and Wales except that &quot;voluntary boarders&quot; can be received in registered hospitals and houses licensed under the Lunacy Acts. There is sound reason, for thinking that If 2rair law in England and 7/wales Is brought up to the. Scottish standard, the effect in reducing the number of persons whom it is necessary; to certify will be considerable and on medical, humanitarian and economic grounds alike, the argument for an amendment in the law is. very cogent.I propose accordingly -(1)  that Visiting Committees shall be empowered; to receive, maintain and treat In their ins titutions persons desirous of voluntarily submitting-themselves for the purposej(2)   that they shall be empowered to provide or arrange for out-patient treatment of persons suffering from mental disorder.(3)  that they (or the Committee of a hospital registered under the Lunacy Acts or the proprietor of a house licensed under those Acts) may, with the approval of the Board of Control., receive In their institutions, or arrange with voluntary hospitals, to receive , persons suffering from mental disorder.A draft Bill carrying out the above proposals Is attached - to this memorandum.I should draw attention to three points which requirenotice.First as to departmental responsibility under this Bill. There is one body of opinion which maintains that the sphere of the Board of Control should be limited strictly to certified lunacy and that the persons referred to In the Bill, not being certified lunatics, should.be outside the sphere of the Visiting    i Committees . and&apos;the Board of Control and under the responsibility of the Minis try.of Health and the local au-.tr yr..-ti.-e&quot;.., as distinct
24from the Visiting Committees.      This point is one of difficulty, but I have come to the conclusion that the arguments in favour of placing this work under  the Visiting Committees and the Board of Control are conclusive.      The other solution means  the setting up of duplicate machinery in the areas and at headquarters for dealing with two classes of persons who often ai-.e very difficult to distinguish - there would be extra expense and great confusion of functions.      The Board of Control, as it is now constituted and operates, is keenly desirous of assuming the new duties, and its desire was strongly supported at a numerously attended conference of medical superintendents and representatives of Visiting Committees early this year.      If responsibility for mental disorder is taken away from the Board, its aspirations towards improvement and modernisation ox1 treatment would receive a very regrettable ,setback..    .1 think the Board is quite capable of doing the work and should have the responsibility for it.The second, question is the question of *&apos;safeguards against improper or illegal detention of ln-pat^itrts ,     One safeguard will be the ordinary machinery of visiting and inspection by the . Board of Control which&apos; is preserved by the Bill, But I propose further -(1)  that a person received as a patient suffering from mental disorder must be received on a recommendation signed by two medical practitioners, one of whom will be a person nominated for this work by the Board of Control, (2)   that such a person cannot be received aixl maintained for a period exceeding six months subject, in suitable cases, to extension for a further period of six months either with the approval of the Board of Control or upon a further recommendation    (3)   that he may leave at any time on 48 hours notice to a responsible person of his intention to do so,    (4)   that the Board or the medical superin-tendent or any person entitled under the Lunacy Acts  to direct the discharge of a private patient from an ins titution may at any time direct the discharge of a person received under the Bill,
25It will further be seen that I am proposing that powers in regard to persons treated under the Bill shall be restricted to public authorities,) except as regards  the Committee of a registered hospital or the proprietors of licensed houses.     Licensed houses are really private asylums for the well-to-do and subject to special and very frequent inspection by the Board of Control.     Their number is limited by Section 207 of the Act of 1890, and I am proposing to maln* tain that limitation in this Bill.     Registered hospitals are few in number and do not increase - they are mostly charitable foundations undor special and frequent inspection.     If it appears that public opinion demands  that the powers conferred by this Bill be exercised by public authorities only, I should have no objection to such a course.The third point is the question of inspection.     This Bill may throw, at all events at the outset, extra inspection on the Board of Control, and the number of Commissioners is now inadequate to carry out the inspections provided by Statute and has been so since the economies effected during the War.     Many of the inspections can well be carried out by inspectors and not by Comniissionera-f and I propose to meet this point by giving a general power of using inspectors at the discretion of the Board of Control.I desire the authority of the Cabinet for the Bill. I realise that further progress this Session will be impracticable-able , but I think it very desirable to introduce it filth a view to a full public discussion of its provisions.A.
