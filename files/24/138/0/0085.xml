[This Document is the Property of His Britannic majesty is ^Government. ]Printed for the Cabinet.       September 1922.SECRET.   .CP. 418(5.CABINET. ,    &apos;I circulate the following telegram which has been received from India, as I think that my colleagues will be interested to see the view of the situation taken by the Government of India.PEEL13th September 1922.From -Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of State for India,I lilt September 1922.1124 8. Greco-Turkish crisis must be expected to cause violent repercussion throughout the Islamic world, and may add considerably to our difficulties in India, on North-West Frontier - and Afghanistan. We therefore earnestly beg that His Majesty&apos;s Government will give every possible weight to India&apos;s interest before reaching their decision. We recognise the immensity and complexity of the problem and the limited area of our own knowledge of the international situation, but Indians interests, internally and externally, are so deeply involved that we dare not let this deter us from pressing! our views. From India&apos;s standpoint, the essential thing is the restoration of the old cordial relations between Great Britain and Turkey, and fact that Greek debacle was preceded by Greek demand for Allies&apos; evacuation of Constantinople seems to us to afford an opportunity. Whether our own proposals last February would still suffice seems very doubtful, they are at all events absolute minimum. In any case we earnestly beg that His lViajesty&apos;s Government, whilst taking steps for adequate protection of minorities, will assume the leading role amongst Allies with which she is credited throughout the East, and will not suffer France and Italy to reap credit of taking the initiative in recognising fundamental change in   . position.   Restoration of our old relations with Turkey wotddmean :-(1) Immediate reconciliation with Muslem India as a whole, and crippling, if notextinguishing, of non-co-operation movement. (2) Material strengthening of our position in Afghanistan and consequent easingof our frontier difficulties. (8) Detachment of Turkey from Russia, and consequent set-back of Bolshevism.Even if it should involve readjustment in our general Arabian policy, this would be compensated for by increased stability, the cutting down of our own commitments and eventual restoration of our general prestige and. influence throughout the East. On the other hand, any attempt to rob the Turks of the legitimate fruits of their victory would awaken a storm much greater than before throughout Islam, and might, probably would, involve serious consequences to India.5718       100   9/22
