paoviaioHAL mi-toes11th Meeting (Private)Held at St. JamesTs Palace at 11 a.m. on July 22nd, 19 22.All the representatives of the members of the Council and the Secretary-General were present.735.    THE IdANIATES QUEST 1013.    ,The PRESIDENT informed his colleagues that he had received a visit from Consignor Ceretti, the nuncio of the Pope at Paris, who had come  to London to be at the disposal of the Council and to explain the views of the. iioly See.M. VIVIAN I proposed that the council Should take note of the mission with which the nuncio had been entrusted.     The continuation of their discussion would show whether it were necessary to hear the nuncio, but it  should  be realised that there were other interested parties who might also  ask to be heard .lord BALi-OTIh agreed that the Council could not say as yet whether it would be&apos;necessary to hear representatives of any of the religious communiti es .The Council decided to post no one its decision as to the hearing of    assign or Cerotti.The HAtuJUIS IilPERIALI informed ths Council that the Italian Government was ready to assent to the mandate for Syria under reserve of certain explanations and assurances for which the prench Government had been asked and which were similar to those which the Italian government had. asked and obtained from the British Government .     The assurances in question were at present under discussion between the French and Italian Governments .
i i   ! m -    132LORD BALPOUB said it was understood that the fate of the i lea date for Syria was bound up with that of the Mandate for Palestine.    Pending a settlement of the questions of detail concerning the mandate for Syria- as between the Prench and Italian Governments the oouncil -might perhaps enter upon a discussion of Article 14 of the mandate for Palestine seeing that agreement on the Mandate for Palestine appeared to be complete except for the Artiele in question.Mo  VIVIALM supported this proposal.   The Council might discuss the terns of the mandate, reserving its approval for a public meeting on Monday .THE MAS&apos;,iUI3 HIPSRIALI assumed that the discussion would be confined to th e articles ojg the mandates until he had received the Authorisation which would shortly arrive to   prove simultaneously the mandates for Palestine and j-yria.The council entered upon a discussion of the terms of the mandate for Palestine.Mo  VIVI Ail A said he wished to make certain observations on Article 14 which was bound up with Article 13.Article 14 of the draft mandate was based upon Article 95 of the Treaty of Sevres.    Article 95 of the Treaty of Sevres stipulated in its second paragraph that the mandatory power should appoint as soon as   vossible a special Co Emission to study any question or any com flaint concerning the various religious communities, and to establish rules for their administration. Account must be taken in the composition of this Commission of the religious interests involvedo    Tho Chairman of tho Commission was to be nominated by the Council of the League of nations in accordance with the provisions of this Article, Article 14 of the Mandate, para; 1, had been drafted as fallows:-
&quot;In order to determine the exist in:: rights- in the Holy places and religious buildings or sites- in Palestine,&apos; which the mandatory is pledged under the preceding article to maintain, a Commission consisting of not less than seven -members shall be appointed by the mandatory, subject to the approval -of the Council of the. League of Nations.    The duty of the Commission will be to frame a report to define these - rights,. including rights of ownership,, user and access.    The report shall- be laid before the Council of the League of Nations for confirmation, and when confirmed shall be &quot;binding on the mandatory.&quot;There were two objections to this article...  Although the number of the members of the Commission was not of great importanc it was necessary to determine how the majority on the Commission should be composed.    Should it be cachelie or not ?Secondly, there was the question of the competence of the Commission.   As he understood the British proposals, Article 14 was intended to set up a provisional Commission whose ddty it would be to substitute a new regime for tho status quo.Article 95 of the Treaty of Sevres did not bear out this interpretation, for even if Article Qii did not exist, it was impossible to contemplate the sudden change of a position which had lasted for centuries.    A    small and purely provisional Corn-mission could not regulate &quot;any question or any complaint&quot; which might be presented.    The British Government fully realised the position and had agreed that an exceptional arrangement should be made in regard to its mandate by constituting a special Com^ mission to deal with, the question of the Holy Places *Article 13 of the mandate asserted the principle of the sovereignty of the mandatory power who was entrusted with maintaining order and public welfare and assuming entire r-esppn-sibility for the Holy places .   Under this article the mandatory was responsible for the ; Pslem and the Christian sanctuaries. It was therefore for the sanctuaries of Jerusalem and Bethlehem alone that it had been nsce-s nary to draft the article 14.
Lord BALFOUR said that the British Government so far as the various religious and national parties were concerned, was in an entirely impartial and independent position.    It had no other interests beyond the interests of jnetice and order and it would he only too happy if the text of Article 14 could he improved from this point of view.As regards the number of the members of the Commission, there were two possibilities..    The Commission mi flit have a purely judicial character...    In that case there would be no necessity to take account of the political or religious views of its members.    It might, on the other hand,  seem prefer a-ble that the Commission should be composed of representa-tlvea of the various religious and national parties, and in that case the number of seven members would have to be increasedo    The former solution seemed perhaps preferable at first sight, but the events of the last months had shown that it might he difficult to apply it in practice,    on the other hand, a Commission with too many members would have m-&quot; ry disadvantages.It had never heen the intention of the British Govern-ment to substitute an entirely new regime for the status quo.    Certain ri.--h.ts had undoubtedly been definitely acquired and there were man:/ questions on which no dispute could possibly arise.    The decisions of the Commission would only be concerned with questions at the moment in content:&apos;, on * As soon as the Commission had. come to a decision on the questionr:, submitted to it, it would have nothing further to do.    It would suffice to lay down that the Commission should meet in case of need,  since if it sat preminently,  the League of Nations would be involved, in considerable and unnecessary expense.It was in any case desirable to avoid the appointment of a permanent Corur&amp;Bsion which would involve creating
a kind of executive power.by the side of the mandatory power, which must be sovereign.    The British Government under this reserve was prepared to agree that.the Commission should meet whenever it appeared to be necessary.... The J ARQHI3 IEP3R1ALI thought that the members of the Council were in agreement- on the.two following points:  first, that there, would not be an entirely new regime j but that vested rights- should be respected; secondly, that the Coord s si on shou.1 be permanent in the sense that without actually being in session it would continue to exist, so to speak, morally.As regards the composition of the Commissiisp, it would be of advantage for it to be composed of representatives of the powers which had most interest in the countryQ    These powers were In point of fact Catholic powers.M, VIVTABT said he did not propose that the permanent Commission should meet every day.   He had wished to show that Article 14 of the draft mandate did not carry out as it should the intention of Article. 95 of the Treaty of Sevres, and that it was impossible for the Commission to have a pro-visional character.    The important question of the majority on the Commission remained.    It did not seem probable that the Council could decide this point at once.Lore1 BAI1?CUR drew attention to the terms of paragraph 11 of the note addressed on \Tuly 1st, to the Secretary-General of the League of Fat ions, &quot;in reply to the letter of &quot;&quot;Cardinal Gasparri of the 15th Hay.    The article was in the following terras, :*11.   As a further means towards ensuring absolute impartiality His Majesty1a Government would be pre-pared, if the Council of the League approved this course, to select nominees for the Commission from a panel put forward in the first place under some International procedure., whether by the Assembly or Council of the League of Nations, or by the
-    1311President of the Court of international Justice, while reserving to themselves the right to submit additional names for stated reasons to the Council of the League for approval.    The panel, should in their&apos; opinion be composed of person&quot; of world, wide reputation,  to bo selected in such a way that the Commission would be a thoroughly representative body,  on which none of the three confessions, namely Christain, Mohammedan and Jew would be without representation.    His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would also invite the Council of tho League to appoint one of the members of the Commission as its first Chairman, by whatever procedure commends itself to the Council,-This paragraph showed how the British Government proposed that the members of the Commission should be chosen,M-. VIVIAIiT said that this text did not cox^rect the dis-crepancy which existed between Article 14 of the draft mandate and. Article 95 of the- Treaty of Sevres,Lord BALFOUR said he was happy to note that id. Viviani recognised that Article 13 embodied the principle of the sovereignty of the mandatory -power.   As agreement seemed almost complete the Council mi gat- now decide to approve the mandates for Syria and Palestine, ptJ-pu.bating that they should entersimultaneously into force as soon as the French and Italian Governments had reached an agreement on the points which they were discussing, and reserving Article 14 of tho mandate for Palestine which would, be finally drafted at a later stage,M. VTVIANI said he was ready to accept the proposal of Lord. Balfour,    There was an agreement in principle on the sub-stance of the two mandates which could only enter into force at the same.time.    It wag therefore opportune to examine their articles.    The Council would be in a position to draft Article 14 of the mandate for Palestine at its next session.,. Meanwhile an agreement of the French and Italian Governments on the quest under discussion would, oaune the two -mandates automatically to come into force.
The MARQUIS 2MP31R1ALI agreed that the mandate for Syria might he considered as approved and coming into force as soon as the French and Italian Governments had come to an underst.and.ing He doubted however whether it was possible to adopt the Palestine Mandate and to put it into operation if Article 13 14 remained in suspense.M. VIVIANI represented that if agreement between France and Italy were reached as to the Syrian mandate,  the Palestine mandate might at once be regarded as operative.,, even though Article 14 had not yot been finally drafted,   pending the drafting of the final text for Article 14,  the status quo in regard to the Holy places would persist.TIIS MARQUIS IMPPRIALI said that Article 14 was one of the most important provisions of the mandate,   &quot;dithout it the Mandate could hardly be regarded as a final measure.Mo VIVTALT said that in that case it would be necessary to postpone the approval&quot;of both mandates,,   He asked that Lord Blafourfa proposal should be put to the vote.,H. HYKAHS ashed what woulf&quot; be the effect on public opinion if the Palestine Ile.nc-.ate were adopted with reservations as to the final text of Article 14..    What explanation would the Council be able to give to the public of the delay in finally deterrinln-&apos;&quot; the text of this article ?Lord balfour thought it would not be difficult to explain to the public the position of the Council in regard to Article 14. This article did not affect directly the welfare of the people who- would be required to live under the mandate.    It was of interest mainly to people outside Palestine and in so far as the mandate was concerned might be regarded as of &quot;secondary importance The system of mandates had been conceived in the interests of the populations living in the mandated territories.    The Council could inform the public that it had approved the substanice of the mandate, but that it had deferred for a fey/ weeks certain difficult questions which deeply interested the religious
communities of the world,   public opinion would realise that the- religious questions arising under Article 14 required a good deal of difficult discussion, and would applaud thecommonsenee of the Council in refusing to delay its approvalof the mandates until these difficult but subsidiary matters had been thoroughly settled.       He suggested that theCouncil should decide at once that all the other Articlesof the Palestine mandate were approved and might come into force *so far as the Council was concerned.M. VIVIAN! agreed that it would be quite practicable for the Council to announce to the public that it had approved the mandates but that Article 14, wasjreserved in order that a final draft might be agreed upon,,the Council adjourned further consideration of the matter until the afternoon meeting.
Council 19-th Session P..V.12.POT I SI OH AL MINUTdS,.lBth Meeting. (Private),held at 3,250 p.m., Saturday,  July 22nd, at St. James&apos;s Palace.Present:   All the Mean hers of the Council and theSoore tary General.736.      THE PALES TIKE AND SYRIAN MANDATES ,(Continua tion).The PRESIDENT submitted tho following draft text:-&quot;The Council will determine before the next Assembly of the League of Nations the terms of Article 14 which provides fo* the application of Article 13 of the Present mandate dealing with the Holy Places..     The new Articlo will, fix the composition, the competence and the method -of chbico of the Members of a special. Commission to be appointed for this purpose.&quot;Tho MARQUIS IMPERIAL I said, he was prepared to accept aproposal of this kind.     He desired, however, to suggest that a text should be drafted recognising that an.. agreement ht d beenreached on most of the points dealt with In Article 14.       TheCouncil were, for oxaciple, agreed on the question of competence,.and the traditional /rights involved.     The only point remaining wasthe question of a major:&quot;ty on the Commission.Lord BAIFOUR enquired whether  the Council were quite as near&apos; to..a general agreement as the Marquis Imperial! supposed...M. VIVIAN I said the Cornell had so far agreed upon;- the-necessity of a Commission, but a legal text was required.       The article as at present drafted was not sufficiently explicit.The MARQUIS IM^ErtlALI said that if ArtrcLa 14 were reserved,, he was har.M:y in a position to approve the mandate.   He was prepared to vote for the article as it stood, or to consider
modifications, but if Article 14 ware to be reserved for dis-cussion at the next session of the Cornell, the mandate also should be reserved.The PRESIDENT stated that a new draft of Article 14 was being prepared for discussion at the end of the meeting.VISCOUNT ISHII suggested that the drafting committee which had revised the texts of the B. Mandates in order to bring them into textual conformity with the C. Mandates,  should also be entrusted with a similar revision of the texts of the A. Mandates.ICED BAIPOUR and M. VIVIAlfl said there was no objection to this arrangement, provided it was understood that only   drafting alterations were made.VISCOUNT ISHII drew attention to en important discrepancy be-tween the. texts, of the Mandate for Syria and the B.Mandates. It was provided in the B. mandates that alterations in the mandates opuld only be effected by a unanimous vote on the Council.     In the Syria mandate, however, a majority of tho Council sufficed;M RAP ARB explained that in all the mandates, as . originally drafted alterations in the mandates might be effected by a majority. The Council, however, in discussing the C. Mandates decided that the rule of unanimity should apply.     He presumed that,the same pro-vision, would be necessary in tho A. Mandates, and pointed out that this amendment had already been made in the case of the B Mandates.The Council agreed that unanimity should be required.Tho SECRETARY GENERAL pointed out that Artiole S8 Of the Palestine Mandate imposed on the league a new guarantee which was of a financial character.   He felt it his duty to point out that the League had not hitherto accepted a guarantee of -this kind.The MARQUIS IMPSEIALI thought it was a serious matter for the Council to engage the financial responsibility of all the States Members of the League in a matter of this kind.
LORD BALFOUR thought it was impossible to insert in the Palestine mandate a provision which Was not in the Syrian and the other mandates.     Ho could not defend the text as it stood, but felt it was desirable ihat the moral obligation of the Council should be in some way asserted.After sane discussion it was decided to amend the Article to road that tho Council would &quot;use its ixif&amp;uenoo bo guarantee&quot; that the Government of Palestine would fully honour the financial obligations legitimately incurred by the adminis bration of the country.     ii was understood that the text of all the A, mandates should In this respect be brought Into conformity.THE SECRETARY GENERAL raised the question of the procedure to be followed In dealing with petitions from the inhabitants of the mandated territories.     He represented that it would be convenient to follbw the practice in force in the territory of the Saar, where all petitions wore forwarded to the Council through the Governing Commission.After seme discussion it was agreed that the Council would decide the procedure to be followed whan it came to consider a letter which was being1 ad dressed to it 6n the subject by the British representative.     It was agrood that tho procedure would have to be uniform for all the mandates.THE PRE8IDEBT then presented to the Council the following draft for a suggested revision of Article 14:-,TA special commission shall be appointed by the mandatory to &quot;study and define tho rights and claims in connection with the Holy &quot;Placos and the rights and claims rolatlng to the different &quot;religious communitios ir. Palestine.     The method of nomination, &quot;tho composition and the functions of this commission shall be &quot;submitted to the Council of the League for its approval and the &quot;commission shall rot be appointed or enter upon its functions &quot;until approved by tho Council.&quot;
M. VIVIAN I ana the MARQUIS IMPERIAL I said they were prepared to accept the, revised draft.The Council approved the als^ve Draft of Article 14.THE PRESILiUT rear the following declaration on &quot;behalf ofthe Spanish Goverxument: -&quot;The special position of Spain in the Holy Land is consecrated &quot;by s-sntury-old tradition and the Spanish Goverlament feels itself obliged to draw attention to   . the rights and privileges conferred upon it by this . state of affairs. &quot;&quot;I have therefore received instructions to declare on behalf of the Spanish Government, that even should the Counoil oonsider.it desirable to postpone its decision as regards the organisation of&apos;the Commission for the holy Places, it oonsiders the presence of a Spanish Member upon this Commission as indispensable.&quot;M. YITIAHI and the MARQUIS IMPERIA1I supported the declaration of the representative of Spain.The Pronoh, Italian, Belgian and Brazilian representatives on the Council desired to make the same declaration in the name of their reopeotive Governments.The PRESIDENT on behalf of the Spanish Government saidthat Spain aooepted the mandate for Palestine,    He was instructed   :,to make the following declaration to this effeot:-&quot;The Spanish Government aooepted the allocation to Great Britain of the mandate for Palestine, but the speoiai position of Spain in tho Holy Land, acknowledged for many centuries, obliges It to make an express reservation of the rights and privileges to which it is entitled by this traditional position, particularly as regards the . Spanish nationality of one member of the &apos;Siscretionnaire&apos; and of the &quot;proautjour de la Oustadio&apos; and the election of tho superiors of the various Convents and religious establishments.&quot;M. VIVIANI and.the MARQUIS IMPERIAL I supported the declaration of the President.The Council decides that the Mandate for Palestine was approved with the revised text for Article 14, and that the mandate for Syria would oomo automatically into foroe as soon as the. negotiations between the French and Italian Governments had resulted in a final agreement.   ; It was further understood that the two mandates should come into force -simultaneously.
P H 0 V I S I 0 N A L       M I $ U T B S.&apos;- &apos;- &apos;   -ISIKCB3SSHTH   MBHOTG(Public)-   He la at 3 o^olock on July 24th,, 1983..All the representatives oi* the members of the Council &apos; and the Secretary-General were present.737.    THB MAID AT BS FOR SYRIA AND PALS ST 1MB.r M. vTYTMI thanked the British Government for its welcome and paid a tribute to Lord Balfour for the way in which he had, in a moral sonso, directed their discussions.     He said he wished, in&apos; addressing the representatives of tho press of thoworld, to remove a misunderstanding. .   It was a mistake to reproach tho Council on tho ground that it withdrew from the publicity which was.necessary.     It was in practice essential to distinguish between the secret diplomacy which was a crime, and the discretion which was necessary in diplomatic pi-ocedure, The members of the Council were not always in agreement, as was only natural in representatives of free peoples. Prudence was therefore necessary; and it was not dangerous, as sooner or later the Council had to give an aecount of its proceedings.It was a&apos; great day for the League of Nations on which, after having already accomplished such great tasks, it completed the application in practise of the principle of the mandates. When the war came to an end the Great Powers had not wished, as in the past violently to. annex territories and to Oppress their inhabitants.     Th^mandatory would take the inhabitants under its protection;&apos; it would avdminlstor tho territories in the Interests of all; and it would be responsible to theCouncil
Council and tho -&quot;iSSombly until tho so young peoples were able to conduct their affairs without further assistance.,France had considered and Groat Britain agreed that the mandates for Syria and Palestine should be taken together, Negotiations concerning the Syrian mandate were proceeding between the Italian and French Governments similar to those which had taken place between the Italian and British Govern-iiLents for Palestine.     Tho political crisis in Italy which had Just occurred might delay the negotiations but it might be taken for granted that an agreement would be reached before long.The League of Nations had made in less than three years considerable progress&apos;.      Its committees were at. work; the Brussels Conference had enunciated useful economic and financial principles; the Court of Justice had been set up; the question of Upper Silesia had been peacefully settled.    All this work had. been accomplished in a situation, which was without, precedent in history.LOFtD .BALF0UR wished to endorse what M. VIviani had said concerning the work of tho League.     The League had been in existence for only a short while, but it had already done agreat work which he found was too often ignored by the public.Passing to the particular business for which the present Council of the League had been called, Lord Balfour said that the mandate for Palestine was settled so far as the League of Nations was concerned.      It had boon agreed that the mandate for Palestine and the mandate for Syria should go together. The solidarity of the two mandates which had boon urged by the French Government   at a previous meeting of the Council In Paris was recognised by the British Government.     He did not think there was likely to bo any disagreement or difficultybetween
between tho \rench and Italian Governments in settling the points wMen wera under discussion between thorn with regard to the Syrian mandate.      In any event the difficulty and delay which had orison in connection with the Syrian raandabo owing to tho political crisis in Italy would have no effect on the policy or application of tho mandates as a&quot; whole&apos;3 So far as the Council of tho league of Nations was concerned, tho long period of delay in defining and approving the mandates was now at an end, and neither the Council nor the Assembly would again be required to consider them.There wore two parts to the &quot;Palestine mandate?    Cne was concerned with Palestine and its inhabitants; the other was concerned with the E oly Places.     Concerning the Holy Plaices there would be further discussion.     Long historical controversies were involved in the consideration&apos; of this part of the mandate which necessarily required careful and jealous consideration.      Article 14 as contained in the mandate gives security that tho policy favoured, by the British Government would be fully carried out.     Tho British Government only dosirod to administer historic justice as between tho communities o once mod.     Thore was no desire to deprive any community of Its ancient rights or to ignore any of tho religious interests involved.There had also been controversies with regard to the part of the mandate which c oncornod Palestine itself, andthose contr by or 31.as had been encouraged by tho long delay in settling the mandates.     It had been represented that the interests of tho Arabs wore not sufficiently safe-guarded, but the most anxious attention had been paid to&apos; the position and interests of tho Arab populations by tho British Government, and there was no wish or intention thatthe
the provision of a Jewish home in Palestine should in any way injure tho best interests of the Arabs0     Every pro-caution had boon taken that tho provision of a Jewish homo should not enoroaoh upon the interests or susceptibilities of any section of the population^     The material prosperity and moral interests of all the people concerned could not fail to be advanced by the course which the British Government Intar-:-dod to pursueo     Ho would address an earnest appeal to alllegitimate while the scheme was under construction, but now that the mandate was settled, it would be a great crime for any one in any way to attempt to feed animosities in Palestine and all over the world by emphasising the racial, religious and historical divergencies whioh had been revealed in the course of the negotiations aThe British Government,, as the mandatory power, would firmly pursue the policy which it had publicly advocated.I-CED B ALP OUR, in conclusion, thanked M. YivianI for his references to the hospitality of the British Government,   Tho British people wore proud to have the Council of the league in their midst and he felt that cn this occasion it could be claimed for tho Council that it had not fallen behind a tradition   which, though short, was one of permanent and fruitful achievementoTHE MARQUIS IMPERIAL! thought it his duty to do fine thfy point of view of the Italian Government in order to avoid misunderstanding.     The Italian Government  a&amp; always thought that the A mandates should be basod on the Treaty of Sevres out of which they had arisen.     This also had been the opinion of the second Assembly.     For some time nothing had been done in the matter, as it. was necessary to leave the Governments time to negotiate with   the United States, In May, 192S, tho Italian Government had asked the British Government for certain assuranoes with regard to thepartiesPise ass ion and dls&quot;ipute had been inevitable andmandate
mandate for Palestine.    The same request had  just been addressed to the French Government with regard to tho Syrianmandate.      This request was at the present moment thesubject of negotiation.      It might be taken for grands-? ,that a satisfactory agreement would soOn be reaches. whichwould allow the ma-Mate for Syria to enter automaticallyinto force.As the representative of a Catholic country he attached the greatest importance to a settlement of the questions lelsvnrg to the Holy Places mentioned in Article 14- of the mandate for Palestinec      It was essential that an agreement should be reached between the Meubers of the Council before the nez-ct session of the Anncmblye     In conclusion he desired to pay a tribute to lord Ealfom&apos; and te congratulate him in the name of the Council on his 75th birthdaysTHE PHBSIPBN-T read the following declaration: &quot;In view of the declarations which have just been made, and of the agreement reached by all the Members of the Counc.il, the articles of the mandates for Palestine and Syria are approved,.     The mandates will enter into force, autDmatically and at the same time, as soon as the Governments of trance and Italy have notified the President of the Council of tho -League of Nations that they have reached an agreement on certain particular points in regard to the latter of these mandates,,The present negotiations will be resumed at Geneva on August 30th before the meeting of the next assembly, eapressly to solve the questions submitted for its decision under Article14 of the mandate for Pales tinenaThe Council approved this Declaration-, 738* CLCgf CP T.dTV SESSION.TBS PPESIPMT emphasised the importance of the work&apos;accomplished during the present session.     He joined hiscolleagues in the tribute and in the congratulations whichhad been addressed to Lord BaIfour.
Ho reminded the Council that in principle it should, as far as possible, hold its meetings at Geneva, but useful exceptions might be made to &apos;this rule.
