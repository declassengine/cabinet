4rThis document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. SECRET. fe  -CP. 4158.THE CABINET. :REPORT ON THE SITUATION IN IRELAND FOR THE WEEKENDING 5th AUGUST, 1922.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.      &apos;!I circulate the report on the Irish situation by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Ireland, for the week ending 5th August. ,L. W.-E.The Wae Office,12th August, 1922.Southern Ireland.Dublin. There has been a slight increase of activity on the part of the armed forces of both political parties in and round Dublin during the week.Occasional ambushes of Provisional Government troops in lorries and cars usually take place between 5 p.m. and 10 pan., after which the nightly sniping of Provisional Government posts and barracks by Republicans begins. This spasmodic firing and resultant exchange of shots increased to more than ordinary severity on the night of 5th/6th August. An official statement issued by the Government on the morning of 7th August explained this. Apparently a large number of men from Cork reached Dublin via Liverpool, and, fully equipped with explosives, intended to destroyi many bridges on roads and railways radiating from Dublin. The Provisional Government appears to have had full knowledge of the plan to cut off Dublin, and their counter-measures, which were well carried out, resulted, it is stated, in the capture of 160 of these men and the prevention of any damage to communications. The rumours lately current that further trouble was to be expected in Dublin were probably due to some leakage ..pf information regarding the extremists&apos; plan of action. What further hostile action was planned is not known. - .The hostile feeling between both parties is growing, and it is believed that attempts will be made on the lives of General Michael Collins, Arthur Griffith and other leading-members of the Provisional Government and Army Headquarter Staff.Harry Boland, an extremist and Secretary to De Valera, died of the wound he received when attempting to evade arrest. His funeral took place in Dublin last, week. Of the 30 priests who attended the funeral, only two belonged to Dublin parishes. Of the remainder, the majority were priests over from America on a holiday, and the notorious Father Albert of the Four Courts Garrison was also present.The Catholic clergy is gaining increasing unpopularity with the Republicans, and religious ministrations are being refused except in extremis.The bitter feelings between the two parties is resulting in a good deal of &quot; give away.&apos;&apos; The important leaders of the Provisional Government Army are all members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, and there is apparently a definite split in Ireland in this secret organization. This split has been reproduced in America in the affiliated society of the Clan na gael.In the Republican propaganda sheet &quot; Poblacht na h-Eireaim &quot; of 3rd August, a statement appears charging Lieut.-General J. J. 0&apos;Connell (now General Officer Commanding, Southern. Command, Provisional Government Forces) with being responsible for planning the murders of British officers in Dublin on 21st November, 1920. &apos;     &apos;    KV&quot;Outside Dublin. The Provisional Government forces, having now cleared all important towns and villages (except Clifden, Co. Galway) in the centre and west, have now reached a general line running from Tralee in Co. Kerry to Waterford. Brigadier-General Daly with 500 men of the Dublin Guards landed at Fenit near Tralee on 2nd August with but little opposition.   This force has now got touch with 0&apos;Duffy&apos;s018321
columns, moving south and south-west from Limerick.   Prout&apos;s column from Waterford has occupied Carrick-on-Suir and should by now be near Clonmel. &apos; Republican headquarters are believed to be at Fermoy.A reliable person who has lately returned from Cork gives the following information about that area : Cork City is, to all outward appearances, normal ; but the labour situation is acute owing to the closing down of factories, and shopkeepers who deal in clothing and other articles required by the Republican troops are suffering severely from the commandeering of their stocks.It is reported that the Republicans have seized in Cork cash to the amount of  100,000, taken from excise and customs dues and from income and other taxes. Agents and friends in Cork of the Provisional Government have repeatedly asked that the banks in Cork should be closed by order from Dublin ; but so far without result.Cork and Queenstown districts are quiet, as apparently most of the armed Republicans in these areas have been sent to the fighting zone further north.Eighty to ninety per cent, of the population of Cork City are said to be for the Provisional Government, and are sick to death of the methods of the Republicans. Owing to shortage of petrol, motor cars and lorries are of little use to the rebels, and therefore horses and bicycles are being commandeered freely. The seizing of horses (200-300 are stated to have been taken in the Ballincollig district) is not adding to the popularity of the Republicans with the local farmers.Interesting developments are expected hi the Cork and Queenstown area within the next day or two.In connection with the affair between H.M.S. &quot; Badminton &quot; and armed Republicans (mentioned in last week&apos;s report) off Lackeen Coast Guard Station, Co. Kerry, an interesting document has been captured lately by the Provisional Government troops. It is an order signed by Officer Commanding, Kerry No. 1 Brigade, dated 10th July, and a/a extract reads as follows :  &quot; If an English destroyer or sloop comes within rifle shot of your shore, snipe it,, and, if possible, have a rifle grenade dropped on deck. Possibly then they may shell the coast or make a landing the very thing which we want them to do. Then we have the old enemy back, and that will clear the whole aspect of the present war.&quot;.  . Northern Ireland.There has been a slight increase in the number of shooting cases and bomb outrages in Belfast during the past week ; but on the whole the city is quiet, and it is reported that Catholics are returning to their work in the shipyards and other places.The border has remained peaceful, and the commander of the Provisional Government post on the southern side of the border at Black Lion (near Belcoo, Co. Fermanagh) and the officer commanding platoon of &quot; A&quot; specials at Belcoo are on friendly terms.It is understood, that the inhabitants of Pettigoe are sending in shortly an appeal to Mr. Lloyd George to allow the British military control of that place to continue. The petition will extol the comfort of living under a benevolent military despotism a strange and unexpected development of life in Ireland !Conclusions.The reply, dated 4th August, by General Collins to the recent effort of the &quot; Peoples&apos; Rights Association,&quot; of Cork, to bring about an armistice and, eventually, peace, is satisfactory. Briefly, it is to the effect that the Republicans must surrender unconditionally ; that they must surrender all arms and war materials to the &quot; national armoury,&quot; and that all property and moneys seized must be restored.The military authorities of the Provisional Government realize that the discipline of their troops is not of the best, and that there is considerable jealousy between members of the late Irish Republican Army and those who have never served in it.There still exists a very strong feeling of comradeship between many men of the Provisional Government forces and the Republicans. But the Provisional Government is also beginning to realize that if military progress is to continue at a reasonable rate in the south-west, their men will have to &quot; shoot to kill.&quot;C. F. N. MACREADY, General,commanding-in-Chief, Ireland.General Headquarters, Ireland.8th August, 1922.
