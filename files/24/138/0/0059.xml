((THIS 2JOCUMB13T IS THE property  OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEBBMSNT) SECRET. CAB I M B T.CP. 4159. THAIS POLICY COMMITTEE.        - fA     IINTERIM Pi3PORT TO THE CABINET.1. Tho Committee was appointed &quot;by the Cabinet onJuly 24th 1922 (Cabinet 41 (22) Conclusion 2), to examine the question of British trade in all its bearings, with a view to the alleviation of unemployment. various proposals have been made to the Committee for the direct relief of unemployment as distinct from proposals for indirect relief by means of the stimulation of trade. As these proposals required immediate consideration if they were to have any effect in the forthcoming winter, and as they had already been before the Unemployment Committee, the Trade Policy Committee thought it desirable to consi der them.IRIM 2.       The Committee have held three meetings and d3sireJIMSNBA-4 OF THE In this Interim Report to make certain recommend a oions ITTSE.to the Cabinet which will, in their opinion, help to alleviate the unemployment situation.   These recommendations are as follows:-1 *     Land Drainage and Improvement.The Committee have had befofe them the recommendation of the Unemployment Committee set forth in a Memorandum by the Minister of Health datod July 25th, 1922 (C.P.4126) that the scheme of land drainage and improvement whioh was undertaken in relief of unemployment last winter should be continued through the next winter in excess of present commitments for which provision has been made in the estimates and in the/
and in the Supplementary Estimates made on July 19th, and that financial provision should bo made for them&apos; by a supplementary estimate to&apos; be presented in the Autumn,    The -Committeeunderstand that last winter tho land drainage --and improvementschemes were well administered, and produced most successful results.     They-employea on tho average 5,000 to 6,000 mena- week (including Scotland) and nearly 90 per cent, of themoney used I 355,000 which includes a Government contribution of  9,700 to Water Supply schemes) was expended1 in wages. Thetotal- of men-weeks accounted for by the so homes was 148,500.The schemes carried out during last winter were closed down at the end of May since it was considered that agricultural labour would- absorb rural employed&quot;.during the summer. Similar schemes should therefore be started at-latest by the end&quot;of October to deal with rural unemployment-which is expected to be severe during&apos; the next winter.Schemes of this kind are particularly important since theyare practically the only &quot;measures for relieving &quot;rural unemploy-insnt. &apos;; &apos;s :. &apos;--;v&quot;i : &quot;&apos;:y/[:- The Committee therefore recommend :-That- the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Scottish Office should be authorised by the Cabinet to carry out during the next winter schemes of land drainage and improvement sMj Ler to those carried out dur ing &quot;last winter, and that the following financial provision should bo aaue for -these schemes by a Supplementary Estimate to be presented in-the Autumn :-England and Pales  3-00,000     &quot;-Scotland (llths of 41, 25080      300,000.) &quot; &quot;.. 34:1.:  50The- Committee .60 not desire to recommend at present that financial provision should be made for the carrying&apos;-&quot;-&apos;- &apos;   &quot; out of/
out of Forestry schemes during the next winter, as suggested by the Unemployment Committeei2.    Local Authorities Schemes.&apos;By direction of the Unemployment Committee and withthe approval of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, a circularwas issued on the 1st June, 1922,  to Local Authorities^requesting particulars of the public works which they wouldbe prepared to carry out in relief of unemployment onoondition that a Government contribution on the same terms as before were made towards interest and sinking fund.    Schemesestimated to oost   0,000,000 are likely to be submitted by december 31st 1922, and it is thought that the St. Davia&apos;sCommittee will approve 75fo of these..Tbe Committee recommend :-That the Cabinet should approve the recommendation of the Unemployment Committee (CP.4126 para: 2 (a)  ) that provision should be made for continuing the scheme for assisting Local Authorities in carrying out works of public.-utility in relief of unemployment, by a contribution towards interest and sinking fund, on the same terms as before, to lie extent of 75$ of tbe number of applications received up to December 31st, -IS22,      It is estimated that this would involve an average annual charge of approximately  420,000 for a period of 16 years.     The total capital cost of the works would be  15,000,000,  of which the State would bear 65$ of the Interest and sinking fund for a period of not more than 15 years on non-revenue producing schemes, and 50$ of the interest only for a period of 5 years on revenue producing schemes.     Do provision for this expenditure is necessary in the present financial year, since oven if work begins on the schemes by October 1st, 1922,  Government liability for interest and sinking fund will not accrue until the next financial year.
2 0 $TheCommittee have discussed emigration arid have been informed that various-;-schemes are...now being negotiated by the Oversea Settlement Office with Dominion Governments;   Until these negotiations are complete farther-action by the British Government would be superfluous.    It. has, however, been suggested that Training Centres should be established both in this country and in the Dominions for the purpose of giving elementary instruction in agricultural work to emigrants.    The Committee understand that the best training is&quot;that given in the Dominions,., and a recommendation has been made by the Oversea Settlement Committee that Dominion Governments should be urged to establish farm training centres overseas.&apos;The Committee recommend inThat the Cabinet should authorise the Oversea Settlement Committee to urge Dominion Governments to establish farm training centres overseas, but should take no steps at present to establish training centres in Great Britain,4*.       Trade ffac. 11 it ie s Ac tThe Committee have been furnished with full details of the operation of the Trade Facilities Act and the work of the Advisory Committee nominated by the Treasury.Section 1 of the Act which enables the Treasury, subject to a total limit of  25,000,000, to guarantee the payment of interest and/or principal of a loan,the
the application of which is calculated to promote employment in the United Zingdom., has served a purpose of substantial utility.Up to &apos;;june: 30th, 1922, guarantees were approved to the amount of&apos;  17 Million sterling and it is estimated that&apos;employment amounting to 879,000 men -months will be given on work set going under the Act. It appears, however, that owing to the change of financial conditions which has taken place in the last year the powers granted by the Act are not sufficient nbw to Stimulate the carrying out of works likely to produce employment.    The only power which the Act granted was to guarantee loans, the inducement&apos;held out being the saving of the difference between the higher rate at&quot;which capital could be;gOt.on the unsupported credit of the undertaking;and the lower rate at which it could be got with a Government guarantee. Money is now cheap and this inducemerit amounts to little.    The Committee accordingly appointed a .Sub-Committee to consider how the scope of the Act should, be extended in order to deal with the present, situation, and the relative, sections of the.Sup-Committee 1s Eeport are appended hereto. It will be seen that the Sub-Committee&apos;s recommendations are as follows that

2 7 25.    Enlargement of Trade Commissioner.and CommercialDiplomatic Services.In order to promote British, exports various proposals have been put forward by the Secretary to the Overseas Trade Department which will, if adopted, strengthen the Trade Commissioner and the Commercial Diplomatic Services.     These proposals are as follows: - &apos;Proposal.Canada&apos;.Establishment of a Trade Commissioner&apos;^ Office at Vancouver.Increase of travelling and office allowances ofCana di an Tra de C ommi a s i one rs .Publicity, mainly in Canada.Despatch of Trade Experts to Canada for one yearParticipation in Canadian Agricultural Shows,India.Establishment of a Trade Commissioner&apos;3 Office at Bombay.Appointment of a Second Oracle Trade Commissioner at Calcutta.Retention of Trade Commissioner&apos;s Office.Increase in travelling and office allowances.Additional clerical Assistance.British East Africa.Australia.Argentina.Brazil.Appointment of a Third Grade Secretary to staff of Embassy.Estimated Cost. 3,700 per annum. 1,700 per annum.  1,500   - 7,800 1,000 .3,900 per annum.  1,800 per annum. 4,500 per annum.. 250 per annum.&amp;O.00 &apos; 1,300 per annum.
Proposal. Persia. Estimated, Cost.Retention of CommercialSecretary at Tehran.      - i  2,570 per annum.Portugal. &apos;   &apos;- -:Retention of CommercialSecretary at Lisbon.  1,900 per annum.The Secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade also states that he is considering what steps - should &quot;be taken to increase the absorption of&apos; British manufactures by the United States,  and has informed the Committee that a sum of  3,000 may be required either for strengthening the consular service in the United States, or for sending out a special Investigator. He also suggests that a Commercial Secretary may shortly have to be appointed at Mexico City at an estimated cost of  3,100 per annum with a non-recurring expenditure of  825.     He there-fore proposes the provisional inclusion of a sum of  2,000 in the&quot;Supplementary Estimate for the current year.As regards Chili,  it is suggested that as soon as trade . revives&apos; the poat of Commercial Secretary in Chili should be restored at a cost of  3,150 per annum, the- non-recurring : expenditure Of re-establishment being an additional  1,300.The Committee are informed that the total&quot;&apos;-Cost of theproposals made by-the Secretary to the Department of OverseasTrade would in 1922-23&apos;amount to  25,230 and in .1923-24. ,    38,170.     The grounds for these proposals have been fully explained to the Committee, and they afe much impressed withthe relative smallness of the expenditure as compared with.      the magnitude of the return which may be anticipated.They therefore recommend:-(1) That the Cabinet should approve as a temporary expedient for two years the. proposals made by&apos; the Secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade for the Increase of the.Trade Commissioner and Commercial Diplomatic Services:(2) That the proposals in question and their recom-mendation, should be brought, to the notice of the Economy Committee presided over by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.(Sgd).

X X XX X X X5.   The propositions put before the Advisory Committee for assistance under the Act fall into three main divisions(a) Public utility propositions put forward by Statutory Authorities and Compaaiies (Transport., power, light-,, water irrigation, drainage),(b) Propositions from ordinary competitive profit earning Companies (typically manufacturing . concerns),(c) Propositions for loans to Foreign and Colonial Governments.6.    With class (b), the Advisory Committee has experienced considerable difficulty in dealing.      The number of- applications has been disappointing and for the most part they have been for undesirable speculative ventures,  -   Inherent difficulties have also disclosed themselves in Including such undertakings under the Act. The difficulty of securing continuous good management gravely affects the security.     The guarantee of a concern, the profits of which, are not limited, involves in substance making a present to private interests0 This provokes criticism and opposition from competitors and the general public which has already made Itself heard in Parliamentc71,    On the other hand-, assistance to classes (a) and (c) is free from these disadvantagesc      Their profits are often limited;, their continuity is assured] and. the public benefits more directly from the help given.     With few exceptions, it is in these.last two classes of under-taking that the larger propositions are to.he found which&quot; would, be of most direct benefit to employment,/ItExtract from Report  of the Sub-Committee appointed, to no one-ider the operation of Section 1 of the Trade Pacilitics Act, 1921.
8. It seems therefore desirable that any greater facilities than those hitherto provided under the Act should be confine! to classes (a) and (c).       To give further help such as that described below to class (b) would be criticised on the grounds th*s t undue benefits were being conferred on private interests.     Experience of the working of the Act suggests that what is needed for classes (a) and (c) is that the Government should be prepared to meet whole or part of the interest charges on the loans to be raised for the first few years (say three, or at most five) of the career of the undertaking.      Conditions might be imposed requiring ro-lf&amp;fmont of such interest out of profits in excess of some substantial amount.      Tt is usual, no doubt, to add such charges to capital end thus to spread their incidence.     But the contribution of such interest charges,  which might amount to say 10$ or 15$ of free capital,  &quot;jould nevertheless be a sub-stantial bonus, and might be expected to bring to the birth a considerable number of largo undertakings,  and especially of colonial undertakings.9. .as regards undertakings of Local Authorities, the form of assistance suggested above should be treated as an alternative to the present scheme for assisting the revenue-producing works of Local Authorities with part of interest charges.10. Further, the Act provides, a s said, for guarantee only.     This financial machinery has not been found sufficiently elastic to fulfil the purposes of the Act, Further powers are need 3d to adapt the form of the help to be given to the needs of the case.     In particular, sememethod/
method is required to meet the case of undertakings for which a public issue is unsuitable.      That could be met by giving power to proceed, not only by guarantee, but by a direct advance of the capital required.11.(b)    The work of the Advisory Committee, which is responsible for passing applications under the Act; has been performed with the greatest ability and. assiduityc But it is proved to be more arduous and to require a greater sacrifice of time than any voluntary organisationcan fairly be expected to give.     Further, a voluntary Committee has neither the staff nor the authority necessary to take the initiative in stimulating schemes.12. For these reasons it appears desirable that the administration of the Act,  in so far as classes (a) and (c) are concerned.,  should be transferred to executive departments.     No single department is in a position to cover the whole field.      The most efficient method of administration would be as follows :-       That each of the following Departments, the India Office, the Colonial Office, the Board of Trade, the Department of Overseas Trade, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Transport should accept responsibility for surveying its own part of the field , for stimulating applications, and for recommending them to the Treasury, if approved,     The function of the Treasury as regards the recommendations from the Departments would he the same as that which it now exercises as regards recommendations from the Advisory Committee.     In order to facilitate applications by the public they might be made in the first case, as at present, to the Secretary of the Advisory Committee.As/
13 b As&apos; regards Class , (b&apos;.It does not seora desirable to make any change-either In the.. existing powers under the Ago or in the- machinery   J which those powers are exercised.  &apos; &apos;Both economically and politically there would be objections to extending to this -class the new facilities suggested above for classes (a) and (c)j and the retention of administration as regards this class in the hands of an outside bsdy with a semi-judicial position is very desirable in order to prevent any suspicion of partiality.3 ....   -14o The Act confined the amount of the loans to be guaranteed t-; 25 million sterling and. the time, during which guarantees might be&apos;given tc 12 months (expiring 10th November 1922),      If a fresh impetus Is to be given to the work in the particulars suggested above, it will be necessary to enlarge these limits.      It is suggested that the limit of amount for guarantees and loans should be Increased to 50 million and the time extended for another year.-15. It appears desirable that power should be taken (which does not at present exist), by charging a premium or other^se, to create an Insurance Fund to compensate for possible losses.2.
