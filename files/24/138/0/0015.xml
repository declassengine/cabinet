Page 1YOUNG COMMUNIST LEAGUE....................... &quot;   7DISTURBANCES AT SOUTH SHIELDS................ &quot;   8CONVICTIONS.................................. &quot; 10THE &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;.,......................... &quot; 10IRISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IB GREATBRITAIN................................ &quot; 11summaryOn July 10th the wholly unemployed on the live registers totalled approximately 1,371,600, a decrease of 18,363 on the previous week:   short time workers on the same date numbered 93,000 as compared with 98,521 on July 3rd.Communist activity in connection with the annual conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain failed to secure a vote in favour of affiliation with the Red International of Labour Unions, the voting 883 against 118, the latter figure representing the South Wales Federation which moved the resolution.Increasing attention is being devoted to the railwaymen and communist propagandists are trying to awaken them to the &quot;dar/ger of their position&quot;,, a settlement of the dockers^ dispute has not, so far, been reached: communists are making plans for the exploitation of a stoppage.There is evidence that the Third International is taking &amp; lively interest in British affairs:   important emissaries connected with branches of the movement are in this oountry:   Indian seditionists in Berlin are working up a closer connection with extremists in this country and trying to arrange for the help of English communists in the distribution of propaganda in India.Members of the Socialist Sunday School movement are considering the possibility of collaboration with the Young Communist League.
THE OOMMURISTSa report has been received to the effeot that at thd last meeting of the Executive Council of the Third International it was generally recognises that Great Britain had been the chief stumbling block in the Russian schemes for a world revolution:   clumsy propaganda was declared to be the cause of the British workers&apos; attitude to the Soviet system:   it was resolved that more attention must be paid to careful propaganda in the Scottish trade unions and that propaganda for Western Europe must be modifies in such a way as to make it more acceptable to the workers of the countries concerned.The current issue of &quot;The communist , vvhioh is devoted almost exclusively to the mining industry, is a good example of the policy which the Communist Party intends to pursue in regard to the trade unions:   Walton ITewbould deals with&apos;&quot;Capitalism and Coal&quot; and J.T. Murphy with &quot;The Miners at the Cross Roads&quot;:   articles on the situation in the North ,3a. at ,   Yorkshire, Hottiogham and Derby r Lanarkshire and Fife are contributed by George Harvey, G. Shiilito, OwehFora, Alexander Ritchie and John 3ird. Hat Watkins went to Blackpool for the annual conference of the Miners1 Federation of Great Britain and engaged a room in the Trades Ball for three days &quot;to meet all sympathetic delegations and discuss saich problems as arise at the conference from day to day&quot;.The miners&apos;1 leaflet, to which reference was made last week, is an appeal for affiliation with the Red International of labour Unions and is entitled &quot;Our Call to the Miners of -Great Britain&quot;:    on July 15th twelve quires of these leaflets were/
were sent to the Lancashire Divisional organiser for distribution.The Communist Party has begun an active campaign among the railwaymen:   on July 11th a letter was read at the London^ Distriot Council of the national Union of Railwaymen in which the Party pointed out &quot;the danger&quot; of the railwaymen^ position and a-ked leave for a speaker to address members: the speaker is to be given half an hour at the next meeting on August 8th and W.O. Loeber, of Hornsey, who engineered the matter, has suggested that J.T. waiton Newbould is the best speaker:   the standing orders at a meeting of the Stratford Ho.l. branch were suspended in order that Sewbould might address that meeting also.   A list of communist members of the National Union of Railwaymen in London has been drawn up and the twenty-nine men concerned have been instructed to send reports on their present working condition^ to King Street:   they have also been ordered to form mucleiI in order that, in the event of a strike, they may be in a position to carry out the policy of the Communist Party.Sylvia Parikhurst&apos;s group is reported to be working in conjunction with the Red International of Labour Unions in   I order to &quot;assist&quot; the dockers and railwaymen:   JJorah Smythe &apos; said recently:   &quot;We have two hundred men who are sufficiently class conscious to join us in our endeavour to excite the class-struggle:   these men will he under our orders:   we are trying a new stunt - if there is a strike our men will offer themselves for employment&quot;.It is reported that Thompson and Puttock (London .organisers of the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union) will j endeavour to have the communists, Soderberg and Blackmore, put on to the Central Lock-out Committee in the event of a   Idockers&apos; strike:   the idea is to embroil the unemployed and 1raid/i
raid warehouses in the neighbourhood of the docks: Soderberg is, however, at present, said to be in.hospital.H. Pollitt attended the annual general council meeting of the General Federation of Trade Unions in Dumfries lest week and opposed Appleton wherever possible:   he was supported to some extent by John Hill of the Boilermakers,A   Bolshevik named G.J. Voz is coming to this country with a &quot;particular message&quot; from the Jesfcsrn Juropean 3eo^etitcriafc of the Comintern:    this message is to be delivered personally and every assistance is to be rendered him by communists on this side as his &quot;business is of great value for our work&quot;,An extract from the minutes of the sub-executive committee meeting held on Juiie 30th states that:&quot;INDIA   -   The National Organiser submitted draft letTer which it was proposed should be sent to the chairman and members of the Committee of the Indian National Congress.   Letter was endorsed and secretary was instructed to forward it.    Copies of the &apos;Vangaard of. Indian Independence1 were to be placed in the Lands&apos; of the sub-executive committee for their consideration, and the question of organising the Indians&apos; in the coimtry was referred, to a later meeting.&quot;In this connection it ia of. interest that Mahandra Nath Roy, the Indian seditionist, in Berlin, is in close touch with extremists in this country and with a man whose identity is not yet known, but who is believed to be a representative of the Third International, to whom he wrote on July 12th:&quot;I write this to acknowledge the receipt of the document and inform you of the faat that your mar, duly came in touch with me.    I will turn over the document as well as him to the old lady who has already x^omised to dispose of him as soon as possible.   But I have another idea about him, and will like to know what do you think of it and what does his employers say?   I will meanwhile sound him on general principle without entering any detail.    I must tell you that the old lady is very cautious in sending any body over.   He told me that there are several waiting here.   None without a definite purpose should be sent     this seems to be the order.   Since, ^ou left our business here has gone on developing, until it has become essential to establish a firm in the home country.    I wonder if your incumbent can be used for the purpose...In/
In order to intensify our work and to organise the ship-ment of our merchandise which is very much in demand, it is necessary to send at least,   two persons, from this end with complete instructions about the technical work they will have to perform^    They will find local collaboration, but this collaboration will not be expert in the beginning.    These two me.a ars to be jotted one at Bombay and the other at Calcutta.    Their principal business will be to look after the landing of the gods and -despatch, thtsia on to the customers. The shipping from European ports is not difficult provided there is somebody to tak$ the delivery.    Then local collabora. tors will have to be trained in and sent out with the purpose of buying the required goods from indicated markets in the European countries.    I hava tried to find such persons among our eoutrymen here, but to no avails    You cannot expect any-&apos; thing from these demoralized emigrants.    Even the energetic father of Abaiavitoh has shown his true colours which are very ugly.    So. if the British firm can be made to do something in giving us a helping hand, this is the time.   We need two good men to go out and organise the Verbindung.   You know our financial state.   These volunteers must find some job which is easily available, all we can offer is perhaps the passage...We have received news about the arrival of the first nos of the paper which has been enthusiastically received by many although disliked by net a few,   More of it is demardsd and the same with other goods of the similar nature.   Bub you understand how sc.oh a good market will be lost unless setter shipping arrangements are made.,    The presect means canaob be relied upon for any length of time.     Different methods have to be found and developed.     This is a very important problem and our British friends can help us solve it by finding two men, above described.,    I hope you will exert your influence in this respect.     Fnat do you think of employing the men here for this purpose and what is the opinion of the party...Now, about the paper,,.. Por India we do not need much more than a thousand at present, but we intend to increase the size (6 pages).     Do you need all the 500 for England or does the number include those to be sent to India from there? How many subscriptions can we expect from England?     Consider-ing the type of the Indians in England, I think it is necessary to be a bit discriminating in the circulation of the paper among them.     Of course, there is no need of any restriction if subscriptions are available...I am waiting for your opinion about the book and the paper.    I have written another manifesto and propose to write two pamphlets in the next two months.    Ho article has, as yet come from England.   A manifesto of the British Party to the Indian People will be of muoh moral and political worth.   In it the att:vu&quot;.Tde of the laboar Party can be taken up and the relation of the British working class with the revolutionary movement for National liberation in the Colonies oan be laid down.    If well written if will be historic doewnent.   P.D. oai be asked to draft it.    I will write him about it.    I am also  willing to undertake the job.   But would rather make the Englishmen&apos; do it themselves.   This manifesto can be published! in leaflet in England and in our paper.    Meanwhile let us havl some article with punch not watery stuff.&quot; f
On the same date Roy wrote to &quot;Jack&quot; (presumably J.T.Murphy) asking him to get into touch with B.G.Horniman andlink him up with Roy:     the letter.continued:-&quot;...You know of Ohaman L*il. He is. at present the correspondent of the Herald in India. Can you get his address from the Herald and send it to me?Can you undertake to find, with the. help of Saklatvala and P.D. some Indian in England who oan be &apos;   .       Bent baok to India for technical work in relation to transportation of literature eto?We will be very glad to have some article from you. Can you let us have something about the &quot;Egypt Affair&quot; -the decision of replacing the Lasoars by ex-service men -the attitude of Havelook Wilson Union, etc., etc.   The exposition of the ease from the point of view of the British. Coranunist?&quot; .Abani Mukherjee has sent, via Palrae Jtatt and Whitehead,the following interesting.communication to Saklatvala:.&quot;last-year when Mre.Evelin Roy went over to England she was entrusted with some work and money.   On her return, she gave an indirect account where both she and her husband stated that during her stay in London she has given you  300/- to carry out certain work.   I, on behalf of the group that are interested in knowing the truth of this statement enquired indirectly from the representa-tives of the B.party in Moscow who knows nothing about it. It was not definitely said that the money was given cash down to yovz. or for you to the party.&quot;The General Federation of Labour of Japan is in touch with the &quot;Hiands Off Russia&quot; Committee and has promised to support the policy outlined in the Committee*s &quot;The Jap In Siberia&quot; pamphlet to the greatest possible extent;   the Committee also has-contact with the Special Trade Delegation of the Ftir Eastern Republic to the United States of America In Washington. &apos; /. -On July 7th a secret. meetings of ithe sub-executive of the Communist Party discussed the Labour P&amp;rty question and decided that MacManus, Palme Dutt ,and Brown draw up a thesis:   the issue of &quot;The Communist&quot; for July 22nd is to be a special Labour Party number.   The secretary was instructed to clrcular-ise branches regarding the recent amendments to the LabourParty/    ^
Earty constitution, instrxusting communist delegates on Trade Councils and other local bodies to remain at their posts pending further orders:   nothing is to be a one to raise the question until action is taken by the Labour Party when in-formation must be sent immediately to ocmmunist headquarters.At tho recent &quot;speakers conference&quot; of the London District Council of the Confaunist Party Bonar Thompson and Pools were appointed to investigate the prevailing methods: it is hoped that the result wl 11 he a greater variety and number of speakers at London meetings.On July 13th S.T.TWiiteheaa landed at Harwioh,     Tom Bell and Patrick Lavin have also returned to this country.On July 2Sna J.R.Carapbell will take over the editorship of &quot;The Worker&quot; in succession to J.S.Clarke.Guy Aldrea has sent the following information regarding his activities to &quot;Rosta Wien&quot;:&quot;I have &quot;been released now since June 21st and have resumed my platform and publishing activity. I am establishing a new Communist Monthly, T2he Red1.     Also I am setting up up-to-date Communist Office organisation in both Glasgow ana London sad can produce aB from August 3st complete printed oifr culare and correspondence papers printed on one side for reproduction by journals of the movement. I can also do efficient and complete world circu^ larising, producing at a rapid rate, In the most efficient office style*     My attitude is well-known but I shall be quite prepared to plaoe my services at your disposal and those of our comrades in Russia.     I am raising  500 in all to equip these Communist headquarters with efficient services. I hope to succeed inthis   and with a limited but hard-working staff buiia up a powerful press organ! sation.&quot;YOUWG/
YOUNG COMMUNIST LEiGUB ,On.July 7 th the sub-executive of the Communist Party received deputations from the National Union of -British Socialist Sunday Schools (Mayne, Fleming, Podding and Poscer) and from the Young Communist League (J.Stewart Yadnai, McPeirmott and Valentine).     The members of the Socialist; Sunday School deputation said that they wished to come to some arrangement &quot;whereby they could use the machinery&apos;of the &quot;Communist Party for extending their organisation and maintaining complete unity among the young movement&quot;:   members of the Young Coimnunist League deputation stated that they were quite prepared to work in the Socialist Sunday Schools provided that they would -       be allowed to carry out their work in line with the Young Communist International:   in: districts where there were no Socialist Sunday Schools the Young Communist League wouia claim the right to set up.its own schools.   Stanley Mayne, the secretary of the National.Council of British Socialist Sunday Schools has arranged, for a regular inter-c change of publications with George Brown , the. Young Communist International representative, from Berlin, who has just come to England, presumably in connection with the forthcoming national conference of the Young Communist League.The above information is the first definite inaica-.tion of a rapprochement between, the socialist Sunday School movement and the Young Communist League and It is doubtful whether it would meet with the approval of the majority of the members of the first body.DISTUSBANCES/
DISTURBS cbs. AT SOUTH SHIELDSI have received the following aooount of the recent dis-turbances from the Chief Constable of South Shields:-&quot;The first conflict which took place with the miners, was on the morning of the 11th inst,,    It practically commenced on the Sunday night the 9th. inst.., when a large number of men and boys congregated at, the entrance of the St.Hilda Colliery, where they were agitated by-      members of the local Communist Party, viz: James Beedham, ....   18, Osbome Avenue; Will Pearson, 118, Westoe Road,&quot;.:    and George Linney, 6, Readhead Avenue.     likewise on the...   Monday night the 10th instant, Pearson was making&quot;him-self extremely busy in,a crowd of ^proximately 3,000 which had congregated at 10.30 p.m. and at tines he was /advising all of them who were miners, to go to the Miners&quot; Hall, Imeary Street, where they would receive, instructions*     These instructions were no doubt to prevent the peaceful section of the Miners - The St.-    Hilda Miners. - from going to work.     About 12.15 a.m. on the 11th instant, everything appeared to have gainedv.-  normal conditions, as a large contingent of Hartonminers had left tjie Miners1 Hall, Droeafy Street, to go;  &apos; fito their own Hall in Bede-Street.   At about 2*30 a.m. the same date about 1,000 men and boys returned march-ing-in military;formation, with so-called leaders, and the man Pearson was again seen amongst the crowd.&quot;At this time, I called upon the men ana boys to- proceed to their homes in. a peaceful and quiet manner, but thoy expressed a desire that they wanted to go to. the St.Hilda Colliery; this. I refused and called upon my men to clear the streets, they were dispersed and the so-called leaders took to their heels, 13 of the de-monstrators were arrested, and at the Police Court the. same date, were each fined  2, for Police Obstruction,The accused were:      &quot;   U: :     :Gilbert Moody, 19, miner, 4, Isaacs Court. John James Monaghan, 19, miner, l ,Baok Boldon&apos; Lane. James Lee, 22, riveter, 4,Lancaster St.,East Jarrow, George Foster Colawe11 Peacock,  1, labourer, 74,Brunswick Street..     -&apos;. -   &apos;r.L;    &apos; .&quot;j John Reay, 32, miner, 21, Harold Street. Edward Boag, 20, miners 18, Union Street. George Downs, 22, miner, 110, John Williamson Street. ;    -   :Thomas Nichols,- 27, miner, 87,. Stoddart- Street. Harrison Brand, 18, miner, 82, Nora Street.- John Bullock, l&apos;-7,;. min*er.,il71^ Mareden Street. Eobert Hogg, 18, miner,&apos;28, Peel Street.-Henry Calrns,&apos;27;j miner; 13Crawford Street. George Foster, 18, miner, 9, Lemon Street.For some tfcae past the Jarrow and Hebburn section of unemployed have been dissatisfied by the amount of re-lief: given by the x*uardiaus - these two districts are included in the district of the South Shields Board of Guardians - and frequently large bodies of unemployed have been brought from these districts to the Boardmeetings/
meetings of the South Shields Guardians for the purpose of deputations interviewing the Guardians.   George Linney, of 6, Eeadhead Avenue, has acted as one of the deputation.   (These unemployed attended the Guardians1 office, on the 6th instant, hut there was not a Board Meeting on that day, they had to go away dissatisfied, with the result they stated that it was their intention to return on the 13th instant.M0n July 12th a meeting was held under the auspices of the National Union of Workers at the Pit Heap, Jarrow, at which the chairman was J.Dickson, 171, High Street, Jarrow: he urged the demonstrators to he orderly the next day and stated that a new branch committee had been formed, consisting of:Harewood or Haywood of Percy Street, Jarrow, Baylor of Gateshead (?) Thoriue of Jarrow.J.Dickson of 171, High Street, Jarrow. Ivey or Ivory of Stoddart Street, Jarrow. To Smith.George Wheeler, the Newcastle communist, also addressed the meeting.&quot;On July 13th, 1922, a contingent of about 1,000 persons attended the Guardians Offices, Barrington St,, South Shields, as intimated, and was headed by a drum, bugle and mouth organ band.    The Guardians would net receive a: cksputoion, and a man named Dickson, who was supposed to be in charge of the men, was requested to convey to the crowd, the result of the Guardians1 de-cisicne    He was reluctant to convey the message, and when he did so, it was in an agitating manner, with the result, the men stated they were not going away until they got what they wanted.&quot;When some of the Guardians were leaving the hall, the men in the crowd acted in a very disorderly manner. They were allowed to stay until all the Guardians had. leftj when i gave orders for them to leave and go away in a peaceful manner.   They at first defied the Police, until I gave orders for the streets to be cleared. Fifteen arrests were made, one of the prisoners being a member of the local Communist party.The accused, who were remanded until this week,were:Janes Meehan, 34, labourer,    Spencer St. Jarrow. John WnuHutchinson, 37, miner, 48,Wawn St. Joseph Abbott, 26, labourer. 36.Cambrian St., Jarrow. George Scott, IS, riveter, 62. Queen*s Road, Jarrow. Wilfred Gill, 35, pllaters1 helper, 89.Clayton St.Jarrow. Samuel CKennsdy3 3C;. labourer. 113,Grange Rd., Jarrow. William Cai-men, 32. ship^s carpenter, 9,Moon Street. Patrick Cunniughams 18.    7,Albion Road, Jarrow. William Calvert, 33, joiner. Heugh Street. Prank Varsahar, 33,engineer, a Belgian,9,Maxell Street. Wilfred George Brow:?. 28. labourer, 141,Sglesfield Road. Joseph Tweedy, 28, hoJder-i-p. 4,Ferry Street, Jarrow. Pa-crick Ctragan, 39, labourer, 76,Charles St., Jarrow. Anrncny Prowse, 36, labourer 23, West Walnole Street. Caragan and Prowse were also charged with having assaulted the police.These/
These distujrbanoes, in my opinion, are the work of the - Communists and Extremists.&quot; , &quot;convictions on July 11th at Tower Bridge Police Court, Stanley Ernest Dallas was sentenced to three months&quot; hard labour and William Rust to two months1 imprisonment in the Second Division as a result of the raid on Woodbine Cottages. Ormslde Street on June 26th.     Both men are communists and members of the Camberwell organised unemployed:   they were charged with wil-fully damaging doers and windows at the cottages and a barrel of machine oil, all the property of William Crook, owner of the cottages and of the Manor Motor Works, Ormside Street. Clara Gilbert Cole pleaded guilty to the same charges on June 2?th and was fined 40/- or sentenced in default to twenty-eight days&apos; imprisonment.    It will be remembered that the Manor Motor Works were raided by the organised unemployed in May last and the woman cashier robbed.The Chief Const&amp;ible of Birmingham informs me that on July 13th Forbes William Robertson and Arthur Edward Swain     j were charged at the Victoria Courts, Birmingham, with &quot;being I disturbers of the peaoe and inoiters of others to commit        f crimes and misdemeanours&quot;:   Robertson was ordered to find two! sureties of  25 each to be of good behaviour for 12 months am Swain was ordered to find two sureties of  20:   the alternate sentences were respectively 3 and 2 months&apos; imprisonment.      I The charges arose out of speeches made by Robertson on June  I 19th and by Swain on June 20th. fTHE &quot;DAILY HSRALD&quot; 1The question of the financial position of the &quot;Dully I Herald&quot; was discussed recently at a meeting of the London I District Council of the National Union of Railwaymen when a Irequest/ m
request that holders of debentures should write them off as bed debts was discussed:   this suggestion did not meet with approval:    a circular, signed by Arthur Henderson, J.H.Thomas and J.Twomey, was then read In which the signatories asked for the attendance of a delegate at the Lecture Hall, Blackpool, when a scheme would bo considered regarding the oxohange of debenture, for preference shares in the new company at the rate of ZJ- per  1 share:   when someone present protested that the Council^ holding of  100 would thereby be reduced to  10 it was bluntly stated that the alternative was the compulsory liquidation of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; Ltd.:   in short the share-holders would loso everything and would be called upon to subscribe capital for the new venture:   it was therefore de-oided to support this scheme which will, of oourse, entail considerable loss to unions such as the Miners1 Federation of Great Britain, which has nearly  50,000 invested in the paper.The &quot;Post&quot;, the organ of the postal workers, has published at the request of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; a suggestion that every executive member and every official organiser and official of Trade Unions should contribute l/6d. per week to the paper for 80 weeks:    it is stated that the sum of  800 a week is needed to carry on the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; until September and that of this sum the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; staff contributes  300 weekly from wages.IRISH FvBVOLUTIONaRY ACTIVITIES IN GREAT BRITAINThe Sinn Fein leaders in Great Britain are very much at variance and are slowly but surely drifting into opposite oamps.     Since the signing of the Treaty the Republicans have looked to Art 0!Brien for guidance but his followers are fall-ing away very rapidly owing, in a measure, to his autocraticand/
and dictatorial methods.   The recent police raids worried many of his followers and some of them fear further polioe action.At a meeting of the Roger Casement Sinn Fein Club at 184, Blackfriars Road on July 12th Art CBrien, the President told the meeting that things are not going well and it is out of the question to try and accomplish much just now as the Irish people in Great Britain were never more divided.   Martin Mcloney, another prominent member of the Club, said the Irish were fast losing the sympathy of the general public here and he would not be surprised to see very soon notices to the effect that &quot;no Irish need apply&quot;.Since this meeting the London Organiser of the Irish Self Determination League, Councillor purcell of Woolwich, has severed his conneotion with the movement.   No man, he says, could stand the domineering manner of Art 0TBrien who endeavo to make a one man show of the League regardless of the opinio of either leaders or members.It is expected that at the next General Convention of the League to &quot;be held shortly, an attempt will be made to make its policy harmonise with the Treaty and this, our cor-respondents think, will be resisted by Art CBrien and h s followers.     Many Irishmen, some of them not entirely in love with the Treaty, are anxious to preserve the machinery of the League for the furtherance of Irish interests In the time to oome.   A re-organisation scheme is therefore talked of but is not likely to meet with much success until Republicans and Free Staters part oompany.So far as Scotland is concerned Joseph Robinson and his followers continue to be as active as ever, although one of our correspondents thinks there are indications of a falling off/
off In the number of his supporters.   He returned, via England, from Blessington, Co. Dublin, on July 8th, having reported to Osoar Traynor how things were progressing on this side.Robinson went to Falkirk on July 10th and met the looal I.R.A. Commandant, a man named Sweeney, ana 30 other repre-sentatives of the looal Battalion at the Catholic Institute who intimatea their willingness to join the Glasgow Irregulars. During the progress of the meeting differences of opinion arose and ended in something like a free fight.It is reported that Captain McHugh of Cambuslang, who went to Dublin on July 1st to fight with the Irregulars, is a prisoner in the hands of the Free State Troops.John Gorman or 0&apos;Gorman, 87, shore street, Greenock, and John McLaren, 10, Hope Street, Greenock, President ana Treasurer, respectively,&apos; of the looal Roger Casement Sinn Fein Club, attended the Executive Meeting at Renfieia street, Glasgow, on July 8th, and voted for the resolution re-affirming allegianoe to the Irish Republic.   These men had no mandate from their club and as most of the members are supporters of the Free State, trouble is expectea at the first meeting of the Club.A big Free State meeting after the local July holddays is spoken of in Glasgow.
