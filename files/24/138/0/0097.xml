C A 3 1 H E :T /      y SECRET. &quot; &quot;.&quot;7   war ,  4198. IRAQ . AIT 33&apos; THE EAR BAST SI TO AT I Oil,Paraphrase Telegram from the High Commissioner of Iraq to the Secretary of State for the ColoniesDated 18th September-(Received Colonial Office 9.34 a.m0, 18th September,19 22).(Circulated hy the Secretary of State for the Colonies).Ho.662 of 18th September,Feisal and I naturally spoke of the stirring news from Smyrna and Constantinople at interview to which my immediately preceding telegram refers.     According to public opinionMustapha Zemal would move against Iraq at once If the Dardanelles question led to a state of war between Great Britain and Turkey.Peisal begged to be kept in our confidence as regards possibility of the Turks undertaking movement against Iraq and any other developments of the situation.      I? el sal sold that in such a contingency as Turkish advance on Iraq Greet Britain must inform the Government of Iraq in what way latter could best co-operate in resistance to the Turks.    All available men of Iraq local forces should in bis opinion be concentrated in &apos; .osul..It seems to me that wo should, take advantage of the present situation to let Iraq Government introduce conscription as soon as the treaty is signed.    National instinct of self-preservation would-make it possible and the policy would itselfstimulate that instinct and at the seme time ease our financial difficulties end dissipate doubts regarding our intentions.    I should be glad to know whether at first sight above proposals commend themselves to you.COX.
