(THIS DOggM&amp;CTJCS THE^ PROPERTY OFi HIS BRITANiilC MJSSTY/ SJ^OVERMI/IEIff ) L4140.1 COpy No. _-C.A B -I; MIT.5.1?^?59. JiEj-^^MP-if 5,. STORE^ CATTLE L Memorandum, by t.b.3 Mh.il3hso of %rj. culture and Fisheries, In view of the voie in the House of Commons on the 24th July and the resolution passed by the House of Lords on the 26th July, it is desirable that the Cabinet should consider the question of the Canadian cattle embargo.     So far as I am personally concerned, I am prepared to accept the verdict of the House of Commons and to carry it out subject to such conditions and restrictions as are necessary for ;tbe protection of our livestock from the risk of disease and for the maintenance of the purity ci the blood of cur herds.    I Sully recog-nise, however, that the restrictions imposed mast not he of such a character as to render the trade Impossible, and that the decision of the House must be carried out in the spirit as well as in the letter-I have discussed this matter with leading representatives of he agricultural industry and I find that there is a great disposition to get the question settled if possible by an agreed Bill.-    It is most desirable, moreover, that this should be done at the earliest possible so,rent;  i,e. in the autumn session, but it is obvious that this could be ^accomplished only If there were general agreement.   A Bill Which Pimply admitted Canadian cattle without any proper regulations would be lighly controversial and would very likely not pass .the House of Jommons at all,  since many Members voted in the majority on the 24th July merely on account of &quot;the pledge&quot; *    Such a Bill would certainly never pass through, the Upper Chamber.The lines upon which T propose that a settlement should proceed P* as follows      (1) We should remove the embargo so far as legislation Is concerned not only in the case of Canada,but of all British Dominions
and place the matter upon an Imperial basis.     Unless this is done, . there are sure to be demands and complaints from other Dominions and we should really be giving a preference to Canada which would be unjustifiable and would impose a slur on the rest of the Empire.   In practice a store trade could not be built up at present in any Dominion other than Canada, but there is no reason why breeding animals should not be admitted subject to proper regulations, (2)   It must be borne in mind that there are three classes of cattle which will have to be dealt with.     These can be divided into (a) store cattle, (b) breeding cattle, and (o) fat cattle for immediate slaughter at the ports.     With regard to (c), the present law could stand, but it would be important that fat cattle should be kept quite separate from store cattle for the obvious reason that as we admit fat cattle from other countries, e,g,, the United States of America, and probably in the near future from the Argentine, to mix the store cattle which are to be distributed through the country with such animals would cause grave risk of the importation of disease.t?ith regard to (a) - store cattle,these should be defined as steers, i.e,, castrated males, since otherwise we run the risk of interfering with our schemes of livestock improvement which have been so beneficial in the past, and with the character of our dairy herds.       Breeding animals should not be excluded, but should come in subject to different regulations.     With regard to stores, the imposition of quarantine on this side would ho very costly in view of the congestion at our ports and would practically prohibit the building up of the store trade, but in view of the 3,COO-mile land frontier of Canada, agricultural opinion will insist that there must be a short period of quarantine or observation. After consultation with the veterinary experts of the Ministry, I suggest that it should take the form of seven days observation in Canada previous to embarkation and 24 hours detention on this side for veterinary examination.     Since the voyage lasts about 10 days,
this would give a period of observation of 18 days, which my veterinary staff regard as desirable, since the period of incubation of foot-and-mouth disease may be as long as a fortnight or even longer.     This minimum period should be put into the Bill, since otherwise the Ministry would be subjected to every kind of pressure to remove any period of observation which it prescribed by administrative order and there would be no guarantee as to the action of future Ministersa     Besides this, the Ministry must retain full powers to lengthen the period if necessary and in the case of some of tho Dominions, eeg,, South African, where at present there is p3.euro-pneumonia., a much longer period would bo essential; the actual terms must be decided by the Ministry in each case.     It is prCposed, however, that not more than the 18 days should in ordinary circumstances be the rulo as regards Canada. The Ministry must also, of course, retain its powers to lengthen the period and stop the trade altogether in the event of an outbreak of disease or grave suspicion of it.With regard to (b) - breeding amtaials, these should be admitted subject to a minimum period of 30 days observation in the country of origin,, durli^ which a tuberculin test should take place. I do not think that Canada could possibly object to this since in the case of breeding&apos; animals sent from this country to her she imposes a period of 30 days quarantine over and above the voyage with the tuberculin test.     Here again, the period would have to be longer in the case of other Dominions, but we need only put the minimum period in the BilleThe Ministry will have to. have full power to prescribe the routes by which animals cross the sea and the ports at which they might be accepted on this side9     It is obvious that direct shipment of stores from the Dominion to this country would be necessary.   For example, it would not do to allow a vessel carrying Canadian stores to call at a U,S.A* port,,     All these matters, however, could bo carried out by regulation and not by Act of Parliaments
19 8.The question of Irish animals will also have to Ije-oonslderedVit pres-ent they are admitted under the Act of 1896 because by that fcct they were defined as British and not as &quot;foreign&quot; animals. Since he south of Ireland is now a Dominion this definition is clearly inapplicable.   At one time I thought that it would be possible to ,eal with the matter by imposing a period of quarantine on all Irish animals, but two great difficulties .arise.    Irish animals are essential to our feeding farmers here, and to impose quarantine ifould be to wreck the trade.   Secondly, Ulster is not a Dominion and she is a great exporter of animals to this country.   Ab$ut 45$ of the cattle coming here from Ireland come from Ulster ports, and although no doubt a considerable number of these originate in the Free State, the six northern counties are great breeding districts and a large percentage of the animals are undoubtedly of Ulster origin.   I think, therefore, that any direct interference with the Irish trade would be very inadvisable, and it must be further borne in mind that Ireland enjoys the island position of Isolation which Canada with her 3,000-mile land frontier cannot possibly enjoy.    The difficulty which arises is that we have no longer any direct control over the Free State Government, but I think a clause might be Inserted in the Bill to the effect that Irish animals will be admitted as at present so long as the Ministry of Agriculture is&apos; satisfied that both the Irish Governments are tarrying out all the laws and regulations which are applicable to cattle in Great Britain.     In the event of the Ministry&apos;s not being so satisfied, the trade could be stopped at once.   Having regard, however, to the fact that Ireland Is a great breeding country, it is not probable that she would become an importerof&quot; cattle;   on the other hand, it is manifestly to her interest toI Ilake every possible step to protect her herds from disease in order fo enjoy the benefit of the British market.These neiw regulations will certainly make it necessary tec increase our inspectorate at a time when the Treasury are most desirous that we should reduce our expenditure.     This difficulty I think can be got over by imposing a small fee for inspection this
side on all animals landed, whether from Canada or any other Dominion or from Ireland,.     I am informed that something in the neighbourhood of 3d per animal (though I do not bind myself to this figure J would probably meet the new cost involved,     A clause to this effect should be placed in the Bill,There is one further question.     The Colonial Secretary in his speech at the Canada. Club Dinner on the 30th June and in his speech in the House of Commons clearly showed that he felt that agriculture, which is being damaged to some, extent by1 the removal of the embargo, should have other means found to sustain it.    I suggest that there should be a definite understanding that if a bill to remove the embargo Is passed in the autumn session, the Government should undertake to introduce legislation early next session to deal with the vexed question of the rating of agricultural land, and that this should be part of the arrangement. In view of the present state of agricultural opinion and the great hardship that the occupiers of land suffer in the matter of rating, I am bound to bring this prominently before the Cabinet.If - the Cabinet generally approves of these proposals, I suggest that it would be advisable that the Secretary of State for the Colonies and myself should consult together with a view to trying to arrange an agreed Bill.     He, of course, can speak from the Dominions standpoint, and I shall be in a position to voice the views of the agricultural community.1st August, 1922,A.Q.B.
