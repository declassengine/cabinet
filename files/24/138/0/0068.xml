[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s(government, jPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1922.SECRET.CP. 4167.CABINET.SPECIAL  REPORT  ON   UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 73.   WEEK ENDED AUGUST 13,  1922.SITUATION.In most Divisions the coal-mining industry continues depressed, but the improvements recently recorded in the Midlands and North-Eastern Divisions have been maintained, while prospects in Scotland are a little brighter.In the engineering industry there Ts no appreciable change to report, except that in the North-Western Division the textile and electrical machinery branches are busy.The iron and steel industry remains quiet generally, but improvements have been observed at some centres in the Midlands. The expected revival in Scotland has not materialised.Apart from activity at isolated centres, there is no change to report in the position of the shipbuilding industry.The Devonshire lace-making industry continues to improve slightly, and silk manufacturers in the North-Western Division are busy. The fine spinning section of the cotton industry continues to be fully employed, but the medium and coarse spinning sections are very slack. The cotton and general textile industries in Scotland continue good. In the North-Eastern Division the woollen and worsted trades maintain the improvement recorded in the last report.The slight improvement registered in the building industry at certain centres in the South-Western Division has been maintained, but the general depression continues.In the boot and shoe industry the activity previously reported in the South-Western Division continues.Disquieting reports have been received from the North-Western Division regarding the prospects in the glass manufacturing industry.Employment in the Welsh tinplate industry continues to be fairly regular, but the copper and spelter industries are still very depressed.The principal jute and flax factories in Scotland are still closed down, and there is very little hope of an early revival in these industries.T.

Workpeople who are unable so to comply are excluded.I.-SUMMARY OF ACTION TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT. [From Autumn 1920 onwards.]Cabinet Unemployment Committee.The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, there was a special discussion at a meeting of the Cabinet, when the Cabinet Unemployment Committee was appointed to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the 8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit, extended the periods of benefit and increased the contributions. As from November 1921 the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision for grants in respect of wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed a special levy to provide for these grants. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, which operates as from the 6th April, 1922, amalgamates the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment Insurance contributions, and extends until June 1923 the special periods during which &quot; uncovenanted &quot; benefit may be drawn. The authority to borrow money from the Treasury is increased to  30,000,000 for Great Britain.Table showing amount paid out in Unemployment Benefit (including Benefit in respect of Dependants) and the Contributions during the period November 8, 1920, to August 12, 1922.

(B.) Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Report. At least 250,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 91,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits and Trade Facilities Act schemes (see table below).SUMMARY SHOWING THE LABOUR EMPLOYED IN GREAT BRITAIN AT AUGUST 11, 1922, ON CERTAIN OF THE SCHEMES REFERRED TO ABOVE.Scheme.
