EMBARGO ON  CANADIAN  STORE  CATTLE.Transcript of Shorthand Notes of Interview by Deputation appointed at tlie Guildhall Conference  on   14th June,  1922,   with   Sir Arthur  Grijfith-Boscawen,   Minister  of Agriculture and Fisheries, at the Offices of the Ministry, Whitehall Place, on Friday, \ 7th July, 1922.MEMBERS   OF   THE   DEPUTATION.Mr. Deputy W. PHENE NEAL, Mover of the- Resolution, City of London.Mr. Bailie J. WALKER, Seconder, City of Glasgw. Mr. MARSHALL T. PIKE, London County Council. Mr. Councillor D. ROSE, junr., City of Birming-ham. Mr. Alderman HORNBY, City of Manchester.; Mr. Alderman WILLIAM OWEN, the Mayor of Swansea.Mr. H. D. McCOMBIE, County of Aberdeen.Mr. D. CARMICHAEL (London Trades Council).Mr. A. V. ALEXANDER (Parliamentary Committee of the Co-operative Congress).Mr. JAMES DICKINSON (National Federation of Meat Traders).Mr. WILLIAM HENDERSON (Free Importation of Canadian Cattle Association).The MINISTER :, Well, gentlemen, there arc, one or two preliminary things I should like to say. One is about the report of these pro-ceedings. It is very unusual to have the Press present, and I feel the better plan is to agree to issue an agreed report bo the Press after-wards.Mr. Deputy NEAL: As a preliminary.The MINISTER: How do you mean, &quot;as a preliminary &quot; ?Mr. Deputy NEAT: We U have a full shorthand note taken, and we shall be printing that. Therefore, it will be open to anybody to mako use of that if they choose.The MINISTER: Later on, certainly; but I imagine you would want something put in the newspapers to-morrow. You- think that is de-siraible?Mr. Deputy NEAL: My idea is to have the transcript made immediately, and handed to the Press.The MINISTER: I think it should be an agreed report.Mr. Deputy NEAL: Very well-, we bad better see what can be done.The MINISTER: We have the shorthand writer with us officially, and we can agree something after the Deputation.Mr. Deputy NEAL: Yes.The MINISTER: Perhaps you and I, or you and one of my officers, could agree on the report.Mr. Deputy NEAL: Quite. The   MINISTER:   The other thing is,  1 hope&apos; I have not inconvenienced you in sug-suggesting that the Deputation- should oome rather sooner than you suggested.   I think you said the 10th or 11th, but I was under the impres-sion that the debate in the House would be on the 10th, and I thought you would wish to :\have the Deputation, before the  10th.    The ptlebate is postponed now, and we might have &apos; had this meeting on the 10th, but I did not know that at the time.Mr. Deputy NEAL: Sir Arthur Boscawen. as Chairman of. the Conference held at the Guildhall on the l^th June and as a member of the City Corporation, representing the Obr-poration here to-day, the privilege devolves upon me of introducing to you the various members of the Deputation, and I therefore have pleasure in introducing you to Mr. Bailie Walker, of the &quot;City of Glasgow;   Mr.&apos; Pike,representing the London County Council; Mr. Councillor Rose, jun., representing the City of Birmingham; Alderman Hornby, representing the City of Manchester; Mr. Owen, the Mayor of Swansea; Mr. McCombie, representing the County of Aberdeen; Mr. Carnridhael, repre-senting the London^ Trades Council; Mr. Alexander, representing the Parliamentary Committee of the Co-operative Congress; Mr. James Dickinson, of the National- Federation of Meat Traders; and Mr. William Henderson, of the Free Importation of Canadian Cattle Association.Well, Sir, on behalf of these gentlemen f orm-ing this Deputation, I thank you for receiving us, but I am sure you will not be surprised when I say that we very greatly regret the fact that the Prime Minister has been unable to receive us personally. i We thouightt that, representing the largest cities and the great mass of the population of the kingdom, perhaps even so busy a man as the Prime Minister would have found it possible to have devoted hlalf-an-hour at least to receiving us here. (Hear, hear.) But be that as it may, we come to you because we understand we are to-day not only addressing you in your - official- oapa-oity as the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, but also because you have been spe-cially desired by the Prime Minister himself to receive us. I think it desirable, perhaps, that we should to-day limit the question that we have to deal, with; it is comprised- in what is known as &quot; the pledge.&quot;&apos;   In the first place, let me point out that 1&apos; disagree with what you said at the Constitu-tional Club with regard to the capacity in which Mr. Walter Long now Lord Long.  acted in receiving the Imperial^ Conference. It\ seems   to me that, the Imperial   Conference&apos;being summoned by the Government at a period in the midst&apos; of war, and therefore at; a time of great danger to those who required to cross the sea, the Government must have had, and did no doubt have, very great rea-- sons for asking the representatives of the great Dominions to come across and attend that Con-^ference. (Hear, hear.) I feel that before, those invitations were forwarded, the Government had come to a decision upon all the subjects and those gentlemen were required to oome, and I cannot help thinking that when Lord Long was asked to become the Chairman of the Conference, he was asked by the Cabinet, in his capacity as Secretary of State for the Colonies, and- he took that chair with tho consent and approbation of &apos;Ms colleagues m the Cabinet.   To all intents and purposes, hewas the mouthpiece of the Cabinet at that Conference. Therefore, when I read the re-port in the White Paper of the conversations that took place between Lord Long, as Chair-man, Mr. Prothero now Lord Entile as Minister of Agriculture, Sir Robert Borden, as Premier of Canada, supported by Mr. Rogers and Mr. Hazen, I come to the conclusion that those five gentlemen arrived! at a decision which, without doubt or question, was in their&apos; minds at the time it was made, -absolutely final-Now, I need hardly refer to the White Paper you are well conversant with it ibut I would refer you to one sentence in it, in whioh the Chairman, towards the close of the Conference, said, &quot; Mr. Protnero accepts that, and there is an end of it.&quot; And then Mr. Hazen points out that, as the Minister has undertaken to carry out the matter, there is no necessity to pursue it further. To my mind, and tho mind of any ordinary business man, that amounts to an agreement, an agreement made on the one side by the representatives of the British Government, and on the other side By the representatives of the Government of Canada, and I think, when they left that room, they were certainly of opinion as Sir Robert Borden intimated a little earlier-tibat a long, troublesome, and vexed question had at last been brought to a satisfactory conclu-sion.Now, Sir, if there is any doubt on that sub-ject, I would refer you to a letter which the Town Clerk of London received from Sir George Perley. Sir George Perley, the High Commissioner for Canada, was in-invited to come to the Conference on the 9th March, 1921, which was opened by the Right Hon. the Lord Mayor, and over which I had the honour to preside, and Sir George Perley wrote under date 8th March the previous day : to the Town Clerk. It is a long letter, and I will&apos; only read short extracts of it. He said:&quot; The matter is one in- which- the Oana-dian Government is specially interested, and which I have on their behalf repeatedly ; pressed and will- continue to press upom the , British Government. As, however, your Oon-feren.ce has been called to consider this question from tho point of view of domestic policy, I hope .you will excuse mo from being present.&quot;At a later stage he said:&quot; Mr. Walter Long, who was the Colonial -Secretary at that time, was in the chair at
the meeting, and, at the conclusion of the discussion, said &apos;. . . mow the position is that the restriction is to be removed, and the Board of Agriculture will take such steps as are necessary for this purpose.   .   . Iwas present on that occasion and understood this as a definite promise. In fact, all the Canadian representatives felt assured that this question, which had been the subject of agitation for so many years, -was finally dis-posed of, and that the emibargo&quot;against Cana-dian live cattle -would be raised at the end of the War. This has, however, not yet been done, but I i hope that in the interests of Empire relations and in justice to Canada the British Government will find it possible to remove this source of controversy in the immediate future.&quot;Now, Sir, following that came an interview in the private room of the Prime Minister at the House of Commons on, the 16th March, 1921, six days after the holding of the Confer-ence at tho Guildhall, and he received the Hon. Edward Fitzroy, who headed a deputa-tion of the agricultural Members of the House, and it is.reported that the Prime Minister, in reply, pointed out that what amounted to a pledge had been giver, by Lord Ernie and Mr. Wjalter Long to the Canadian Government at the last Imperial Conference in 1917. The Prime Minister continued&apos;:. &quot; The question, however, had to be con-sidered as to whether the proposal would lie injurious to British agriculturists, which was a vital national interest, and wThether there-fore, the pledge should be carried out or not. He thought, therefore, that the best plan by far would be to have an. impartial enquiry into the matter, and to consider such ques-tions as whether the importation of live stock otherwise than for immediate slaugh-ter at the ports would increase and cheapen the meat supply or not, and-, if so, to what extent, and whether such a step would be odivisaible, having regard \to roe necessity of protecting the live stock bred in this country from disease, and of restoring their numbers after the losses to which they were subjected during the War. He thought that agriculturists should be prepared to prove their case before an impartial inquiry of this sort, and that if they did, the Canadian Government would not press for the removal of the embargo. The matter must, however, be considered quite impartially in the in-rterests of the nation as a whole.&quot; And you, Sir, are reported to have stated, on behalf of the Farmers&apos; Union, &quot; that they were prepared to accept such an inquiry,&quot; and the Prime Minister undertook &quot; to appoint a Royal Commission on the lines suggested.&quot;So far, we have tho original White Paper, we have.the views of Sir George Perley, who at that time was High Commissioner, and sub. sequently we have the views   of   the   Prime Minister himself.    On the following day the Prime  Minister  had certain questions put to him  in  the  House,   wihich  corroborated  and supported the. statement he had made on the 15th March,   1001.       Therefore, there is no doubt in my mind and I do not think there can  he any doubt in any  ordinary  business man&apos;.s mind that the pledge   was   definitely given.   But, Sir, at that wellJknowm meeting at the Constitutional Club, which I had tho honour of attending and when I had the plea-sure of listening to you, you are reported in &quot;The Times&quot; of 31st May, 1922, as follows: &quot; Then they were told,  and this was far more serious, that a definite pledge had been given to Canada. . If he thoughlt a definito pledge had been given he should honour the pledge. . He was one of   those   who   w-as always in favour of drawing closer the rela-tions between the great Dominions and the Mother Country.   He was a supporter of Mr. Ohamberlain&apos;s policy at a time when many of those people wKo were arguing on Im-peria.1 lines for the removal of the embargo to-day were his bitterest opponents.&quot;Then you go on to describe what, in your view, was that pledge, but there again, as you know, I greatly differ from your view. In my. speech at Guildhall on 14th June last I referred to the significant fact that if Lord Long had agreed with you and Lord Ernie, he would most certainly   not   have   maintainedi   silence from the 26th April, 1917, until then.&apos; Well, Sir, it is curious that on tho 1st July Lord Long broke that great silence, and at the Dominion Day Dinner on 30th June, in a speech which he gave responding to the toast of &quot; Our Guests,&quot; he said, referring to the pledge:&quot; We arrived at a clear understanding at that Conference, and tho pledge we gave then has got to be kept.&quot; When I read those words, I felt we were up against a very serious proposition, and I therefore went to &quot; The Times&quot; office, and asked for an interview with the Editor, and I had confirmation from the Editor that that was a correct report of the proceedings. S-tili, 6o important did I feel this matter to be, that I gave instructions for a letter to be prepared at Guildhall and addressed to Lord Long, to ask whether he approved of the report in &quot; The Times &quot; newspaper. On the Sth July, the Acting Secretary wrote: &quot; Dear Sir,&quot; Viscount Long of Wraxall has asked me to reply to your letter of 3rd July, and to say that, although the report in &apos; The Times &apos; of his speech at the Canadian Dinner was abridged, that it conveyed his meanmg; and that you may quote his words. &quot; Yours faithfully,&quot; (Sd.) Thomas Chaloner, Act. Sec.&quot;Now, Sir, in the face of the evidence 1 have put before you, I am going to ask you personally here to say that you are at length convinced that the pledge was given and must be kept. I think an answer is due from you to this Deputation on that point, and I press you to say that you are absolutely convinced that the pledge was given, and as an honour-able man and a member of His Majesty&apos;s Gov-ernment, you are prepared to fulfil to the very letter the promise which you gave at the Constitutional Qlub.Now, Sir, if you do that, I call upon you to do something else. I call upon you, as the Minister of Agriculture, and in fulfilment of the promise you gave, that you will not carry out, and you cannot carry out, that wihich you are reported to have said in &quot; Lloyd&apos;s Newspaper&quot; on Sunday last you intended to do, namely, tq, speak in the House of Com-mons against the removal, of the embargo and subsequently to vote against it. I suggest to you very strongly, very respectfully, and with all possible courtesy, that, occupying the re-sponsible position which you do to-day, you most certainly cannot take the course which you have suggested in the public Press it is your intention to take; and I honestly believe that, when you come to reply to the question which I have put to you to-day, you will see as an honourable man, occupying the high position you do, that you must fulfil the pro-inise you gave at the Constitutional club, no matter what the consequences may be. That is the cardinal point I desire to put to you to-day.There is one other matter which I have to refer to.    I have   to ask  you to accept on beihalE  of  the Prime Minister the   resolution which, was come to on  the 14th  June.   No doubt you have  seen it, but it is my cuty formally to offer it to you for acceptance, so that you may pass it on to the Prime Minister. Note. The resolution was   us   follows: &quot; That    this   Conference   of   specially   ap-pointed delegates from .the principal nmni-cipalities in Great Britain, representing large masses  of the. population and societies and associations   concerned in the question,   as affecting the interests of consumers through-out  the   country,  urgently  calls upon  Kis Majesty&apos;s  Government forthwith to honour the unqualified undertaking given   to   the Prime Minister of the Dominion of Canada toy the President of the Board of Agricul-turo and Fisheries, at the Imperial War Con-reference in April, 1917, and to let upon the unanimous  conclusions of the Royal  Com-piission on the Importation of  tore Cattle in favour, of the admission into this country of Canadian stores.&quot;There is also one other matter, which I am asked to refer to on this occasion, I happen to be a member of the Central Markets Com-mittee, of which my friend Col. Wlhitaker is Chairman, and this short document has been put into my hand, which I am asked to read to you.&quot; Before I close, I have been asked by resolution of the Central Markets Commit-tee of the Corporation, of which I am a member, to take advantage of this oppor-tunity to refer to your letter, which appeared in &apos; The Times &apos; of 6th June, and subsequent questions asked thereon in the House of Commons on 22nd June, and the allegation that there is a conspiracy in tile meat trade I ,  to sell meat billed in Holland and Denmarkas &apos; home killed &apos; to the confiding public, and that misrepresentation to this end is prac-used in Smithfiold Market. The Central Markets Committee, as representing the Markets Authority, have felt it necessax-y to inquire into the statement so seriously reflecting on the conduct of tho market business, and have fully satisfied themselves that all meat sold by wholesale in the London Central Markets is disposed of according to its origin. Reference is made in your letter to the Union of London Meat Traders. The correct title is the Union of London Retail Meat Traders, Incorporated. The omission of the word &apos; Retail&apos; is alljimportant, as the wholesalers in Smithfield. have no connection whatever with any retail organisation, and accept no responsibility for practices that may be common in the retail trade. The Committee feel sure that as the mis-state-ments cast a reflection1 on the conduct of business by tenants in the London Central Markets, it is only necessary to call your attention to the facts to ensure correction beinsr. made by you personally.&quot;The MINISTER:  Who is that letter from?Mr. Deputy NEAL: It is not a letter, it is a resolution passed, asking me to bring it to your notice. I shall be happy to give you this if you like. [Document handed in.] Now Sir, this matter of the embargo has been before us a very long time. I -want to point out to you, as representing the great municipalities of tho kingdom, that it is by no means a political question with us. We believe it is a national and imperial question. The great meeting at Guildhall on 14*th June affirmed absolutely the determination of the people who were repre-sented by specially appointed representatives, that they intended to press on until tho em-embargo was removed. I deliberately and em-phatically say now that, this Deputation will continue its work, and we hope within, the term of the present Government that the Gov-ernment will see its way to. remove the era-embargo. Of course, so far as we, representing the great municipalities of the kingdom,, arc ooncerned, we can take no part as municipali-ties in any election, but. that would not pre-vent individuals from taking such part as they might individually feel- necessary in the interests of the whole country. And I put it to you to put to the Prime Minister that, in the&apos; interests of the whole country, before the dissolution of Parliament comes and come it must within a very short time this question ought to be settled once and for all. Thank you, Sir, for the courtesy and attention with which, you have listened to me.   (Applause.)Mr. Bailie J. WALKER (City of Glasgow): I think in the first place wo have got to thank Sir Arthur Bosoawen for his readiness to meet us on this particular occasion. There is onie thing that has struck me in connection! with this question, and that is that, although Sir Arthur- Boscawen is an avowed! opponent of our eause, ho is always ready to meet us att -ainiy time we desire. (Hear, hear.) I do not know whether that arises from a desire for the pleasure of out company, or a desire to prevent us meeting- some other person on- whom, we might have more influence than we have had in the past on Sir Arthur.   (Laughter.)Tho MINISTER: It is owing to tho former, I should think.Mr. Bailie WALKER: Be that as it may, we certainly have a feeling- very strongly that on such a very important question, andl having regard to the laot that ijhe Gruilldlhall Conifer-ence was a very representative Conference, re-presenting publio authorities from one end of tho country to the other, the Prime Minister at least might have fourjicl a,s much time to receive nis as ho did to receive the Deputation from, Lanloaisiliii.ro-; because, although, glbvo fabrics and1 the removal of the embargo on Canadian, cattle seem to be widely different subjects, yet, ini view of your attitude on this question, they are very closely related, because I think you, Sir, are the first Minister of Agriculture. I may bo wrong, but, so far as my memory serves me, I think I am righifc-who has defended the rotcm-1 tion of the embargo on purely Protectionist grounds. Other Ministers in the past havo de-fended it on- the ground&apos; that there was a dsui-ger of disease, and I think it was Earl Car-rington in 1906, the then Minister of Agricul-tiure, who said something that is very opposito to the views held, by you, Sir Arthur, and that is this. itlhalt, if he -thought thio embargo was being rotainod on the ground of keeping up tho price of stores in this country,. or in any way on a protective basis, he would at onioo go to . the Cabinet and have the embargo removed.
And right throughout the whole history of tlhis question, tho question of Probeotion- has never arisen. Might &apos;I suggest to you, Sir Arthur, that until the people of this country declare in favour of a Protectionist policy, to be applied to Fall the industries of the country, no one Dc-parbmcnlt of tho Government has any right to uso a worn-out tag, such as the fear of disease from Canadian&apos; hards, in order to bolster up a farm of protection for any one part or  cotion of the oammriuniby. (Hear, hear.) That is the feeling that wo, who, after all, are reprcsenta-tivo of the communities interested in this miat-tor, have in dealing with this question.:. Thie.ro-fon-e, we should lileo that you would convey to iho Prime Mjiiniiistor our strong feeling that the Governiment are to-day deliberately delaying this question (hoar, hear)-in order to defeat it, not by argument, but because they believe that repeated delays will dishearten the pepplo who air moving in support of the removail of the embargo.When Wo brought this question to tho front through political action, we did not deal with it for the first time. For many years wo had been meeting Ministers of the Government amd dealing with the question from the point of yiew of diseaeo. We found we oould make no impression, because there seemed&apos; to bo some influence behind the scenes ; that, irrespective of what was the painty of the Minister who might be in charge for tllio moment, there was a more powerful influence somewhere that prevented this question being dealt with. At first we wore told it was the presence of the Irish Mem-bers in tho House of Commons. Borne of us believed that for some lime, but the Irish mom-berns relieved you of that because they dcKlber-atefiy stayed away. Still, oven with the absence of the Irish Members, the question seemed to remain in the background, so that wo ore forced to tho conclusion that there was same-thing more powerful than the Irish Members in the House, and wo suggest thialt it was tho land-owning and breeding interests of England that were more powerful in keeping the eirri-embargo up. My firionld: mentioned thei Meat Trust. Welly I should not like to think that British pollitiios were influenced! by tho meat packers of Chicago.Wo air in this position, that we brought the question prominanltly before tho Government, and we did not say to the Government, &quot; We tbimlk this is a. question which you ought to in-vestigabo.&quot; Wo said to the GovOiinimenfc that a wrong has been committed, and we think that you. ought, as tho responsible Government of this country, to reimiovo the wrong that has been dbnle, to Oa.uiodia amldl the comimiunitics of Groat Britain iflheotr, boor); amd the Government said: &quot; Wei, it is a long time afro, and there may bo same doubt in our minds mow as to exactly what happened in 1892. so we will aip-polnt a Royal Commission.&quot; The Government selected tho memibeirs of tho Royal Commission, and! they were very careful to state in the House that the Commission was going to be impartiaKhear, hear)-mind that the Corntmis-sioni would have no section&apos; represented! on either sidk\ and fait this Commission would be as im-partial as the Judges in tho Law Courts of Great Britain. It was said they would take evidence for and against, and, having heard1 the evidence for and against, they would come to a decision. What would thoy come to a rjeeisioni far? Not merely for the good of their health, nor for fun. They would, come to that dlcoi-sion for tho purpose of guiding the Govennimient and guiding the legislature of this country on that particular question&apos;.The Royal Commission was appointed, and I moke bold to say this, Sir Ai-thinr, that the case against tho removal of the embargo was put up by the ablest men you could got in this country. As a matter of fact, your 06-partmcnt amid the Irish Department of Agrioul-tu.ro-, out of Gavcrmnrent money, assisted! in; put-ting the case against the removerl of the cm-embargo. (Hear, hear.) On tile side for tho ro-irtovnl of the ombairgo wore a few people with   no funds boihiind them, because, as you are aware, those who advocate puiblic i-cqui rein emits have generally mover mulch foundation behind them. Wo had to depend as witnesses for the removal of the embargo entirely on voluntary support. We had to get up ouir case apart firomi the point of view of counsel, because wa were not aware that counsel were going to be pcr-mitted until the last moment. We had to get counsel at the last moment and&apos; gather funds in order to pay counsel, and brief him in the shortest possible time. The Oommiission sat and listened to both sides boing presented, and thoy have decided the very thing the PrimeMinister asked them to decide as an, impartial h-ibuiiai. They hatve said&apos; that the embargo ought to bo removed in tho interests of the courrnuniiby of this country, and they have answered the question- &quot; Yes,&quot; so fur as they were asked by the Government. We expeoted, Sir, naturally   because, perhaps, wo may ibe simple-minded in this mat-tcir   that a Government which appointed a Royal Commission on its own indtia-tilve, in ordter to prevent it acting without in-fonnatiom wo expected that once tho Govern-in cnt got the decision of the Commission, lcgis-latiian. would have followed as a natural oousc-q nonce,. We- do- not know what it is, but there seems to be something existing in tho House of Commons, or the Governmienlt atmosphere gene-rally, that prevents the findings of these Com-missions, which aro set up to guide the Goy-ortnnient, being adopted. All the expense is in-ournred, and, still nothing is done alt tho finish as the result of their conclusions. We were then informed, after digging it out by question and answer in the House of Commons, that we were going to get, a free day^s debate in the House, with the Government Whips off. That, again, has been postponed from time to time, -and-, so far as we are concerned to-diay, wo do ntot know whether it will bo taken&apos; this ycair or not.Tho, MINISTER: Tho date is fixed.Mr. Bailie WALKER: Tho date was fixed before.The MINISTER: No, never. It was never definitely fixed.Mr. Bailie -WALKER: As a matter of fact, we had&apos; diefinilbo information, and I was recently up in London because of that very fact, that it Was definitely announced.A DELElGATE: It was fixed for the lftth.Mr. Bailie WAI/KER: That is the position we wore talking up; wo were prepared! for it then. Delay has again taken place. Now we are here on behalf of the people of this coun-try, as represented at that Guildhall Confer-einco, and, after all, every main who atteindlodi that Guildhall! Conference was a man who had&apos; to face the puiblic for election. They were alii duly elected people, just like youirsdllf. They have to go more often to the public for olec-tion probably than the Government do. They have to go at certain stated periods, amid they came to that Conference representing the views of thoiiir constituents, and their constituents -taking the number of them represented&apos; at that Confcirenbc, tire largo majority of the popula-tion of this country aro surely entitled to some-thing bettor from the present Government than, metre procrastination on this particular q-ues-tion.   (Hear, hear.)Tho Chairman: of tho Guildhall Conference has deallt very effcetiveily and very strongly with tho question of tho pledge that was given. I for the life of me cannot see how the Gavcmr menit oain resist our demand. I foe] although, perhaps, you will nob accept it but I do feel that you have been placed in an unfortunate position. You aro against the removal of tho embargo because of the principles you hiolidl, but you halve&apos; inherited, from, people who do-not hold the same views as you, probably, a pledge which you must onrry out. The Govern-mcnt must carry out its pledges, and&apos; you must carry out the undertaking of previous Govern-monts soleonnlly cnitared iinlbo, otherwise govern^ mcnt cannot be carried on as between, the Dominions and tho nation.. It is a necessity to do that in the field of international politics. That is the one thing that is being llaidi -down at the Genoa Conference, and all the. rest of them will nob be a success until the Govern-monts of the various oounitries agree that they will! carry out their pledges, mode either by tho Governments of the day or by Governments that have preceded them.We are here to-day, insisting onlce again, Sir Arthur, on your carrying out the. pledge. It maty be that we do so with wearisome reriibeipa-bion to you, having heard the oaso for the re-moral of the ombairgo put, so often, and&apos; having such strong views on the apposite side. Still, as reipiiesenfing tho people who have olbeteldl us in this country, we come, to you again, to-dlay, and ask you to- carry out the pledges given, not anllly to Canada, but the pledges given whan the Royal Commission was appointed&apos;, to remove the embargo. We also ask that, instead of having its free day, the Government shall las it is in d-rMy onid honour bounidto do take part in the debate in favour otf the removal of the em-baingo.We hope&apos;, Sir Arthur, that what has happened ninioe our previous interviews with you will have had some effect in deciding yoti that, if you cannot see your way bo take part in the debate in favour of the removal, at least in, view of tho pledge given you are not free to speak against it. I should like to refer to another point before I sit down. Wo notice that, while the dctbate in the House of Commons has been postponed, a debate is to take place on this question in tlio House of Lords. We should like to know what it means. It has struck somo of us that it is rather a move an tho part of those againsb the removal of the cm-embargo to try and engineer a decision against tho removal in the House of Lords before the debate bakes place in the House of Commons. I hope you, Sir Arthur, as a Minister, are against having any connection, with such a move.Mr. H. D. McCOMBIE (County of Abor-deen): Will you allow me to say, Sir, that I agree with every word that has been said by tho two previous speakers. More ospeoially miaiy I impress upon you,, as a responsible Minister of this gnoat country, tho fooling of UTibation and resentment, common to no political party, which the Govornmonfs action lias produced. I moot it every dlay down, even to women a feeling of resentment, indignation, and shame, that more than three years after tho War a solemn pledge has jvot been honoured by this country. As Bailie Walker has said so plainly, time and again every subterfuge, every device&apos;, every artifice has been used bo dickey discussion of this question, on grounds that to outsiders seem almost inexplioablo.Allow me this afternoon in a word or two to draw attention to a phase of this question which has not been sufficiently made plain to the puiblic. It is this, Sir. We are told that the embargo does not hinder the introduction of Canadian cattle into this country. That is partly true, but it is partly false. In evidence given by Mr. Hodge it is on page 276 on-wards in the Report of the Commission, Sir -you will find an important sbabemenb made by that gentleman before Lord Pin&apos;lay&apos;s Corn-mission, that Canada is not suitable as a feed-ing country, although they can feed a few. Mr. Hodge brought it out that if we did not bake them, then, at the finish if a severe winter came along in Canada many of those animals would die out, because it is a question of tho survival of the fittest. If there is no hay, or it may be there is a partial failure owing to the climate, they die out. Mr. Hodge brought it clearly out that the Western States especially is a breeding country, not a feeding country. He also brought out this veiy important fact, that feeding cattle is an industry for a settled old country such as ours, not for a new country such as Canada. It requires expert managers and men, expert farmers and men, to handle it and handle it profitably.But, more than that, the dlimatic conditions are against the whole business in Canada. Hero we have the best winter stock climate in the world. We have the soil, the farmers, and the men with experience. We have tho natural feeding ground; they have the natural breeding ground. If we do not take their cattle in the raw state to finish them here, we do not get them in the same volume, and they will have to find some other market. As reasoning citizens of this country, is it not better to bake them in the raw state than the finished state, and get the profit from the feed-ing in a country so suited to cattle feeding as Great Britain is?Mr. WILLIAM HENDERSON (Free Impor-tabion of Canadian Cattle Association): It only wish to support briefly what has been said by the Chairman of the Guildhall Conference, Mr. Bailie Walker, and Mr. MoOomibie. I wish also to say one word in support of the argu-ment that a definite pledge was given, which I think has been omitted. That is that. the Departmental Committee appointed by Sir Auckland Geddes refers to it specially in the Report, and says that, in view of the pledge given to Canada at the Imperial Conference, they report in favour of the removal of the embargo. That is additional evidence which I think has not been given. I also wish bo make this point. The pledge was - given, not only to bho Canadian Ministers, but to the Canadian farmers and the British farmers. We have been agitating for the removal of this embargo for thirty years. I carried a resolu-tion against the Corn Production Act^ the only one carriedi, I think, in Great Britain. But we did not got the removal of the Corn Production Act till all the arguments I used against that Act were the arguments the Gov-ernment used when they struck the measure, off.
I     inI notice that Professor Wallace made some reference to a reduction in the price of meat here following the- imposition&apos; of the embargo on Canadian cattle in 1892. I would not put any weight on. ^ that whatever. Inhere are market fluctuations every day, and at that time wages were so low that people could not afford to pay. They are running round now to every -village on account of the depression in trade and the in-creased! supplies of imported meat, and that may have reduced the average price. In any ease, the statement was wrong. It was only reduced by one-tenth of a penny.It has been said that 200,000 cattle would be only a 3 per cent, increase on our stocks. The people who say that do not know what tfiey are talking&quot; about. Our annual kills are two million cattle. Two hundred thousand cattle is an augmentation of our annual output, and is a 10 per cent, increase. It has been found in the case of other commodities, such as sugar and butter, that an increased or de-creased supply of a far less percentage has given rise to a very much greater difference in the price than the equivalent of od. a pound in the price of meat. i think, there-fore, it comes very ill to talk of the &quot; six-penny lie,&quot; when their whole case is based on a lie. They admit it was a He. May-be it was a mis take at the ti me, b ut when they continue to work on it, it is a lie. They are arguing that no pledge was given. It was the Earl of Crowe, Lord Bledisloe, and a Mr. German. He said the price Of stores does not affect the price of meat. He might just as well tell you that a reduction in raw mate-rial did not affect the price of the finished article. The National Farmers&apos; Union, have said that they are supported&apos; by 100,000 farmers in England and 70,000- in Ireland. But we know they are not unanimous. I addressed a meeting in Nor-with of 600 farmers, and only six hands were held up &quot;against me. At Newcastle I addressed 400 or 500 farmers. Only four hands were held up against me, and they had not the courage to move a resolution. If they claim that they have 100,000 farmers in England and 70,000 iii Ireland. 200,000 in round figures  I think we shall find not one of those men has frozen meat in his own house1. No single Irishman eats frozen meat. They fed theni-selves on the best during the War, and&apos; they always do.I should like to point out in conclusion that the Farmers&apos; Union representative, Mr. Robins, said at the Royal Commission that if Canada took our cattle on the same conditions as she asks us to take hers, he had no objec-tion, so that the whole objection to- Canadian cattle was based on the fact that Canada sub-jects the few animals she imports to .a tuber-culine test. That is the whole objection. Why should Canadian cattle be treated differently from Irish cattle? Other countries tax and put heavy import duties on our goods, but we are a free trade country, - and we do not re-taliate. That is no argument against the im-portation of Canadian cattle on the same con-ditions as Irish cattle are admitted to this country, and also Canadian cattle before the false diagnosis in 1892. No matter if the&apos; Gov-erniment try to avoid the issue by delays, those of us who have fought this thing for thirty years will not be thwarted by that, and the fight will have to be won. We will join .with any section of the community that will join in forcing a fulfilment of the pledge given by the Government as definitely as any pledge was ever given.The MINISTER: Mr. Neal and Gentlemen, I should like to say, first of all, I am very gplad to receive you, I am so,rry the Prime Minister could not, but yon realise, I am sure, how extraordinarily busy he is with all kinds of big questions. He asked me, therefore, as the Minister most closely connected with the subject, to receive you on his behalf, which I have been very glad to do, and I will as I. have done on previous occasions faithfully report to him and to my colleagues what has been stated. In fact, I&apos; will forward the full report to the Cabinet.Mr. Dcpuity NEAL: I am much obliged.The MINISTER: Because I realise. thiatt it does not oome to me merely as Miniiistcir of A gricu&apos;] t uarej but as representing the G ovorn-ment geoerally.Mr. Deputy NEAL: That is right.The MINISTER,: But, having said that, I think it is only right I should say -at once that, as far as I am personallv concerned!, i do  not agree &quot;with   you.    The   Governmentare leaving it to a free vote, and there will be great division of opinion and voting amongst the Members of the Gov-e^nmemt. As far as I am concerned, I do not hope that anything I shall say to-day will per-persuade you, nor that what you- have said this&apos; afternoon will persuade me. As far as I am in-dividually concerned, I adhere entirely to my previous attitude, and&apos;, if you will allow me, I will give you my reasons for that. That, I may say by way of parenthesis, will not im any way afreet my giving a full! report of. the. De-putation to my colleagues, &apos; and laying- your views before them.Now, before I go inito the witoolo question, I should like to brush, aside two small points on which there may have been some misundor-standing. I also have seen in the Press) that there is to be a debate in the House of Lords. T know absolutely nothing about that, except what has appeared in the Press. The House of Lords have a right to debate this question, or any other question, and they made their own arrangements, I hope you will understand it has not been done by the suggestion of the Government.-mernt or anybody else; it is a pure acdidonft, and nothing else. We have no influence over the conduct of their business, and if Noble Lords like to put a motion down, they have their ahianJce like anybody else.Mr. Deputy NEAL: But you see the opeira-tibin of at, do you not? Of course, I fully ac-Gept what you say.The MINISTEiR: I am not certain, from my point 6f view, tibat it&quot; will be an advantage.Mr. Deputy NEAL: I do not say it will, but it is very peculiar.The MINISTER: At all events, I have had nothing- whatever to do with it. 1 wash you to understand -that. The other thing is the small point you brought forward1, Mr. Neal, about the question of home-killed meat at SmitihfielM.Mr. Deputy NEAL: That is a much more serious question  than  perhaps   youi realise.The MINISTER: The statement was not miine; it was made by Mr. John Edwards. I have extracts from his evidence hero Mr. John Edwards, -President of the Union, oif London Meat Traders.Mr. Deputy NEAL: You have the mis-stato-ment there.   The word &quot; Retail &quot; is loft out.The MINISTER: If that is so, that is a mis-take.Mr. Deputy NEAL: It is vital to the whole point. Alii I mm concerned about is the Central Market Authority. You see the difference, do you not?The MINISTER: No. 11,317 is the particular question.Mr. Dcpuity NEAL: It is very vital, and I want it partioutarily cleared vip.The MINISTER.: How is he descniibed? Ho is described in the alllplhabeifcioal iniclex of wit-ncssos as Edwards, Mr. J., President of Union of London Meat Traders. You say these wit-nesiscis were inaccurately described in the Re-port. mr.. J. Edwards1 as President of the Na-tionail Moat Traders&apos; Assopiaition. and his pro-per title is President of the Union of London. Meat Traders. You realise, that mistake is not mine ?Mr. Dcpuity NEAL: I am sure you will take steps immediately to rectify that. That is my anxiety to-day. You have made the statement, and it is only you wibo. can put it straiighit. You did it in&quot; good, faith, I agree, but now I have pointed out that there is a mistake, I look to&apos; you to write to &quot; The Times &quot; or any paper you choose.The MINISTER: Did I use that particular title?Mr. deputy NEAL: President df the Union of London Meat Traders, Ltd.The MINISTER: Ho. is Presideinlt of tbe Union of London Retailers?Mr. Deputy NEAL: Wo want the word &quot; Retailers.3&apos;, The MINISTER: &quot;President of the Union oif London Meat Traders&quot; is the description given in this Report. We can take some steps to make that clear. May I point out that I did nothing but describe him as he is de-soribed, and-quote wihiat he said.Mr. Deputy NEAL: WiH you accept, it from me that that is so; that you took it from the paper, and all you have to say now is&quot; that there was a clerical error? . &apos; The MINISTER: Yes, but I shoulH lake to -point-out that,  in so far as Smithfield was brought in at all, it was Mr. Edwards&apos; owii sitatomenfc. The Chairman asked whether aniimals coming from Holland or Denmark, wfluioh had-- been slaughtered in Holland or Denmark, wore sold as English meat,-.&apos; and the Chtairmain went on, &quot; provided! iw is killed in this country.&quot; Mr. Edwards said, not in London, but that previous to the War they would, have as many as 20,000 freslh-kililod pigs from Holland per week, which pigs- Wad been killed at Rotterdam.Mr. Bailie WAiLKER: That does not say they are sold as English, but killed at Rotter-dam.The MINISTER: Oh, yes, it does.Mr. Deputy NEAL: May I point out that Mi*. Edwards, first of ail, is not one of our tenants, and, therefore, he doesi not speak for us. All I represent to-day is the groat wikdle-sale meat market at Smitinfield, and I ask you to notify the fact that a clerical error has been made, that you took it from the Report of the Royal Commission, and that you find, on rc-presonlbation  ram tb e C ity Corp oration, that thero has been a slight mistake, and tiho proper title should include the word &quot; Reta.id..&quot;The MINISTER: We moist correct the- title. There is no doubt as to Mr. Edwards&apos; stato-menifc.(Mir. Deputy NEAL: I do not care about tJhat.   He is not our tenant.The MINISTER: As regards the -statement? Sir DANIEL HALL:   You  want  to  add &quot;Retail&quot;?Mr. Deputy NEAL : I do not want to add anything more than is in the title. The title is the Union of London Retail Meat Traders, Incorporated.m The MINISTER: Now, on the general question-tion, I think Mr. Walker said what is perfectly true, as far as I am concerned1, that I in-herited this question&apos;. I was in no way oon-neoted with the Ministry of Agriculture when the Imperial Conferemce leforiredl to took plaice.Mr. Deputy NEAL:  That is right.The MINISTER: At that time I was in another Government office altogether, and I in-horited this very vexed question, which has troubled practically all my predecessors, amid every one of my predecessors Liberal, Coneer-vative, and Coalition alike has taken precisely the same view that I am taking now.Mr. HENDERSON: No, Sir.The MINISTER: May&apos; I ask you not to in-terrupt? I have listened to all of you without any iriterruption ; I think it is ondy fair thiait I should be allowed to state my oase. If you wish to say anything afterwards, I shall be glad to liisfcon- to you. I say every one af my pre-dceesisors has resisted the removal1 of the em-embargo. It was first of all imposed by Mr. Her-bert Gardiner; ho was a Liberal President of the Board! of Agrioulitture. It was made perana-nemt by Act of Parliament by Mr. Walter T^ong. All his Conservative successors, Mr. Hanbury and the resit, continued the policy. Then tihere was a dhange of Goveiraiment in 1906,( and great pressure was brought on Lord Oarrinigton. Hei retained the emlbargio1, and Mr. Runiciman dlid tine same. He madie a strong speech lately-in tHe last thiree or four months  ^somewhere in Northumbea-llaind, mainitaiiniiinig lias attitude cowcorwinig the embargo. Whan we had a Ooalttiion Government, the same line was taken, and aid the Hast three Mmieters-(Lord Emnile, Lord Lee, who sueceedeidi hini, aindi mysellf  harvo taken pi*ectsely tJlie same Itinc. lord Ernie was President of the Board! for 2  years after the Imperial Coniferenbe, and for niino months after the Armistice. I-ord Lee was Pre-sideint for li years, and he followed on the same limes. Therefore, it is true that I not only inherited the question, but yet I am held up  as I sometiimes am -as the obstinate person-who has taken up a speeiial line on this question-tion, although I have only followed; in the foot-steps df every one of my predecessors.Well, now, my reasons for; that aroi fairly obvious. I will take the wordls that Mr. Neal quoted from a speech made by the Priimo Minister, in reply to the Deputation.introduced by Cap!;. Fiteroy last year, when the Royal Commission was promised. He said-I am quoting from memory wow that the question was that of tlie inlterests of agriculture, which, 1 tihink he said was our most important infdlus-try, and, in my judgment, agriculture will suffer very badly;Mr. Deputy. NEAL: Would you like to have the exact quotation? &quot; The question, however, had to be considered as to whether tihe pro-
33posal would bo injurious to British agricultural-iste, which wins a vital national interest.&quot;Tho MINISTER: And it goes an at the end-guMr. Deputy NEAL:   Yes,   &quot; and   whether, &apos;lbrcyforo,  the pledge could be carried out or Sfot.&quot;Tho MINISTER: .&quot; Whether, therefore, the pledgo could be carried out or not.&quot;Mr. Deputy NEAL: And that the inquiry must be considered with regaird to the national interests.The MINISTER: Certainly. I take it the interests of agriculture are am importo-nt con-sidei-atlon. In my judgment, the national in-tercsts are identical with the interests of aigri-eullbtipo. I think if we- allow agr-idiTturo to go . to pieces altogether, we shall certainly suffer as a nation. I think we have gone, far enough in that o5i.DOdt.ion in sacrificing agriculture in the past, and we have, now a braine-h of agri-culture which is exceedingly successful, and hlas become a great oredit to the country I mean, livestock. We have become the greatest live-stock country in the world. We. export the best pedigree animals to our Dominions and foreign countries, acid they come back to replenish thait stock, and the value of our flooks amd herds is exceedingly great. Some years ago, before the effects of the removal of the Corn Laws were felt, we were a large corn-growing country. We are not now. We do grow a cer-taan amounit of wheat, but. except in certain districts, wheat-growing is not an economical proposition. The farmer has had! to turn, in other&apos; directions, mind he has been so successful in the matter of livestock tho breeding, rear-ing, and fattening of livestock, and the sale of livestock abroad that it has become the sheet anchor of agriculture. It is the first duty of any Minister to look after the livestock of this country, and see they come to no harm. In the development of livestock in this country we had great difficulties. One of the principal difficulties was disease. If you llook at agrioul-tuirul history, you will find that between. 1860 and 1890 we had   tremendous set-backs owing to disease. We htad the cattle plague, pleuro-pnoumonia, and constant attacks of foot-and-mouth.Mr. Deputy. NEAL: Wo have not boon alto-gcther free lately.The MINISTER,: Wo have had no pnieu-moni-a and no cattle plague, and we. have been remarkably free from foot-and-inouth up to this year. For 30 years we have kept the country free of foot-and-mouth, at an average cost in compensation of  9,000 a year. It has been costly this year, but we had an outbreak. We have taken vigorous measures to sl^anap it out, but wo had to suffer before, and that was the reason the so-ealled embargo was originally im-posed. Parliament armed, first Sic Privy Council, and then the Board of Agriculture, with very big. powers of stamping out disease alt home, but it naturally said, &quot;It is no good stamping out disease at homo if you ruin the risk oE importation of disease from outside.&quot; Therefore, aifter a time, the embargo was made universal We said, &quot; We have this island posi-tion in Great Britain and Ireland. We are isolated. Let us take advantage of that, and have absolute security,&quot; and that was the origin of the embargo, and&apos; we have enjoyed, as I have just said, wonderful security since. We havo suffered up to this year scarcely at all from disease. Therefore, it is a very serious matter to reverse this poliloy, which has been dcMoer-atcly adopted and maintained for this very long period. Not only that, but the embargo has bean very successful in the matter of the in-crcase of our livestock. There has been a steady growtlh of the number of animals in this country. T am speaking of cattle onilly, but I can say the same in reference to sheep &quot;and pigs. There has been a continuous growth since the embargo Was imposed in 1892 to the year 1919. It is ir.ue that War conditions and control, and other things I need not go inlto in cWta-il, did cause for a short time an excessive -^laughter of calves, and there was in 1920 some jdhng-off in tho number of our livestock, duo i!o tomiporary conditions which have now gone, but there is now a recovery. Last year we had 200.000 more young animate, that Ss to say, animals of under one year olldl, in Great Britain alone, than in the vear 1920, so that this conitiniuous growth thanks to the sseurirtiy afforded by the emlbairgo though temporarily upset by War conditions, has been resumed, and1 there is no reason whatever why it should not continue. Therefore, I say there is a very strong case from the agricultural. point of view for maintaining this policy of absolute safety.Well, now, I should require very strong airgu-ments to induce me to alter it willingly. You have stated your case, if I may say so, with the greatest fairness to-day. I havo no quarrel with what you havo said to-dlay, but a great many of tho arguments used are very fallacious Bind based on wrong figures. For example, the Other day Mr. Ncoil who I havo no doubt was perfectly accurate-quoted figures to show the excessive amount of imported frozen or chilled meat brought into Smithfield Market. I have no doubt, Mr. Neal, your figures for Sraith-fieild are quite accurate. - Mr. Deputy NEAL: They are official.The MINISTER: But &quot; The Times &quot; news-paper wrote this: &quot; At the present moment, between 80 and 90 per cent, of tho meat con-sumed in Great Britain is. imported, and&apos; the immense majority of the population have to be content with, it because they can get no other.&quot; .Mr. Deputy NEAL: If they had put &quot; Groat London,&quot; it would have been all right.The MINISTER: Yes, but they put &quot; United Kingdom.&quot; That figure is entirely wrong. I am afraid London comes off rather badly in this matter.Mr. Deputy NEAL: The other day it was 92.5 per cent, imported.Tho MINISTER: That may be in Smithfield, but it is not the case in the country generally. I am giving you figures now which include meat and animals coming from Ireland&apos; as im-ported. It is only on such an assumption that you can come anywhere near &quot; The Times &quot; estimate, and I do that because &quot; The Times &quot; says &quot; Great Britain.&quot; In. the case of beef and veal in the year ending May, 1921, the imported was not anything like 80 to 90 per cent., but 68 per cent., oven including the Irish.Mr. Deputy NEAL: I think roughly the consumption is 60 per cent.The MINISTER: Well, if that is admitted, well and good!Mr. Deputy NEAL: I said just now that the words &quot;Greater London&quot; should have been put in.   I am not responsible for that.The MINISTER: I do not say you are, but that is the sort of argument put forward, which makes the discussion of this case exceedingly j difficult. Mutton and lamb, 68 per cent., pig meat 65 per cent.Now, what is tho abject of this kind of argument? The object is to try and prove that the removal of the embargo will remedy this state of affairs. It has been said, though, that the Canadians themselves only say they could send 2OO,&apos;0OO cattle a year.Mr. MoCOMBiEE: To begin, with.The MINISTER: I do not know about that, but let us assume that those cattle are addi-tions to our present supply. I do not believe they would be. In my opinion, you will so . destroy the confidence of British breeders that thiey would not be additions. In my opinion, there might be some additions, there might be none, or there might be a loss. But assume they are additions; they are only 5 per cenr&apos;. of the beef supply and 2-  per cent, of the total moat, supply, and how are you going to remedy this grievance by such an extraordi-narily small addition, if indeed there would be any addition at all, whioh I douibt. Then an-other argument has been used, and I mention it because Mr. Duncan Carmichael is present. It was not anything ho said, but a statement made by a gentleman in the debate at the Labour Party Conference at Edinburgh the other day, when a motion- was carried- con-demning the embargo. Mr. Oariniohael, I think you moved the resolution.Mr. OARMICHAEL (London Trades Coun-cil): I did.The MINISTER: And Mr. MoLeillan, of Birkenhead, seconded. In seconding, Mr. MoLellan spoke of the need of replenishing our own stock. Fifty per cent, of our milkers, ^he said, wore diseased, but before we could slaughter them we must have cattle from over-seas to take their place. We wanted free fresh meat, and not the cheap rubbish that was now being imported.Mr. . CARMICHAEL: The London Trades Council had one resolution on the paper, deal-ing with Canadian cattle only. The Birkenhead Trades Council put down one on opening of the ports for all foreign cattle, and I got him to withdraw that and second my resolution; but he went on, as he usually does, dealingwith the opening of the ports for all foreign, cattle. He is desirous of cows coming, spec-i-ally because he is interested in the milk ques-tioo, but it had nothing to do with the oni-embargo when he dealt with that point.Tho MINISTER: I am afraid you were rather unfortunate in your seconder. We all are sometimes, but that statement is a very wrong statement. It is a great pity such a statement has been made in print, but w*? know we have tuberculosis in cattle here, and we are taking steps to put an end to it. It is an- outrageous statement to say there is 50 per cent, of disease, but on the strength of it the &quot; Daily Express &quot;has a great heading, &quot; Cattle Ban Peril to Babies.&quot; Is there no tuberculosis in Canada among tho dairy cattle?Mr. Deputy NEAL: A very low one.The MINISTER: No, no, gentlemen, please ! Allow me. I have listened to you, and I ask you to listen to my answer. . I am not bring-ing any special charge against Canada, but they know and admit that they have tuber-culosl-s among their cattle. I have the report of the ^Veterinary Director General of Canada for March, 1921. I will give you one figure. the-y test certain accredited herds; they are really selected- herds. In that year they tested 10,712 animals. Of these there were 1,702 who reacted to the tuberculinetest. That is tuber-culine testing of. accredited and supervised herds. Number tested 10,712, reactors 1,702. percentage of reactors 15.88. Sir Sltewart, Stockman points out to me that these are Be-, leoted herds that have been tested before, and this is the second time of going through. These are milking cows. Now, I want this thing to bo argued on a fair and proper basis. Is it not nonsense to talk about replenishing diseased cattle here by importing from a coun-try which admits and there is no question of casting a slur it has tuberculosis in its milking herds, and quite properly is taking steps to stamp it out?Mr. Deputy NEAL: Are the ages given of the cows?The MINISTER: I do not think they are. You see how difficult this question has be-come on account of the extraordinary mis-statements whioh are constantly made. Then Mr. Henderson has referred to what he calls &quot; the sixpenny lie.&quot; I have never called it the sixpenny lie.Mr. HENDERSON: Your supporters have.&apos;The MINISTER: I think my supporters-have pretty good reason to be somewhat an-noyed by the things said at the Dudley elec--tion. However, the faof is the Royal- Oom-mission absolutely refused to admit that any-thiing in the nature of 6d. per- pound could be taken off.- They flatly refused to believe it.-, And really, in my huniHe judgment, the prico of stores does not affect the price of home-killed meat in the least. Let me give you some examples. Mr. Henderson, I think, has quoted the fact that after the embargo was* imposed1 the price of beef was  &amp; per lb. on an average I think you disputed the figure, but that is the official figure less than before the embargo was imposed. That was not on a. temporary basis. We do not take in get-ting out figures one particular year, but an average of five years.Take another case. By universal consent, in the spring of last year, stores were suddenly, dear. That did not in the least mean that meat was dear in tho autumn. On the con-trary, there was a tremendous fall in the price of fat animals-, and.meat was cheaper in tho autumn. The fact is and this is what I am trying to bring home to you and other people  that one of the great difficulties of the British farmer is that, unlike some other people, ho. cannot pass on the cost of production. The price he gets for his produce is not governed by the cost of production, it is governed by the cost of the imported, article. We are a free trade country, and we do import a tremendous amount of corn, meat, and other things.Mr. HENDERSON: Everything but store cattle.; The MINISTER: That does not affect the&apos; argument.Mr. HENDERSON: It is the whole key to it.Mr. Deputy NEAL: It is the root of it.The MINISTER:. Not at all! If you can show me that by importing store oattle- you decrease the price of meat, I should say there is something, in- it. Take wheat. - The price of wheat does not depend on the cost of pro-
 faction of wheat. It may be very high one year, but you do not get any more for your wheat, because the price is fixed, not here but in New York or somewhere. The- price of meat does not depend on the cost of produc-indication; it depends on the cost of production, of the imported article. I have studied these figures with great care.A DELEGATE: Not as a farmer!ANOTHER. DELEGATE: As a politician. . The MINISTER: I really think if you come to a Deputation, you might be civil. I have tried to meet you in the matter of courtesy, and I resent the remark I heard&apos;. It ought not to be made.Mr. HENDERSON: I apologise.The MINISTER: - Of course, I accept-your apology. I say these figures show that over a long period of years the price of home-killed meat will always be slightly above the price of imported meat.Mr. Bailie WALKER:  Frozen meat.The MINISTER: Yes; I am speaking of frozen mieat, frozen or chilled.Mr, Deputy NEAL: May I intervene for one moment- as a member . of the Central Markets Committee? Last week American beef was sold at  d. per lb. more than the, British beef.The MINDSTEtR: Yes, there are exceptional fluctuations, but if you take the averages it is different. You must take averages; you cannot deal with an exceptional fluctuation at one particular time. You will find that as the imported chilled meat goes up in price, so the home killed will go up in proportion. As it goes down, the home killed will go down in like proportion, the fact being that the im-ported meat dictates tho price.A DELEGATE: Limits the price; it does not dictate- it.The MINISTER: If you do not like the word &quot; dictate,&quot; I say that in my opinion, it makes the price, or influences the price, and the price of home lulled does not depend on cost of production; it depends on the price of the imported- article, and not for a single moment do I believe that the existence of the embargo makes meat dearer, or that its re-moval would have any effect whatever on the price. Nor do I think it would have any ap-preciable effect on the amount of home-killed meat for the consumers of this country. If you could shlow me that it would, I should be prepared-Mr. DICKINSON: May I ask a. question? Is there any hope from what you have said tins afternoon of the consumer getting cheaper home killed meat in the near future?&apos;The MINISTER: Yes.Mr. DICKINSON: You told us our stocks have favourably increased. Our cattle ate much about the same as for. some years, per-haps as .good as for some years, but you must admit that our sheep supply for the last thirty years are in a different position. Is there any hope of the British consumer getting cheaper home killed meat, because in face of what you said this afternoon the faot remains that Eng-lish meat to-day is costing&apos; twice as much as imported, and. you told us a minute ago that it is always the case for fresh killed meat to be slightly in advance of imported. If such is the case, I say it is a poor look-out for the consuming public who want English meat. They are not getting English meat now, and that is what the cry is. If you go into the London better-class shops to-day, or at the- sea-side resorts, you will find the principal article on sale in the butchers&apos; shops is imported moat.The MINISTER: I have given you the figure. I have told you about 68 per cent, is imported. Then you ask if we are likely to have more English meat in the future? That will depend on one thing only, and that is the amount of confidence in the breeders of this country, and one of the chief reasons I am opposed to the removal of the embargo is that I feel perfectly certain it will shake the confidence of the breeders.Mr. Deputy NEAL:  I disagree.The MINISTER: I began, I.think, by say-ing that I knew we disagreed. However, I have listened to your point of view, and I want to state mine, but if you have- any views about that you have only to read the evidence of Lord Ernie before the Royal Commission. He gave strong evidence before lite Royal Commission, and he said that the farmers are strongly opposed to the removal of  the em-embargo and that it would shake the confidence of the breeders.Mr. Deputy NEAL: That is only partially true.The MINISTER: And here is the point which I think is important. You have quite rightly called attention to the fact that the Royal Commission, generally speaking, re-ported in favour of removing the emibargo. .Mr. Deputy NEAL:  That is  so.The MINISTER: I. have not the time to criticise the Royal Commission at length, but may I point out one thing in passing; that is, that they never answered the question we asked them. We asked the, question as to how the embargo was affecting live stock of all kinds coming from any part of the. world. For some reason or another, they deliberately limited: their inquiry into the case of cattle only, to the exclusion of sheep and pigs, and only to Canada.-Mr. Bailie WALKER: I think it wag ac-cepted at the time that the controversy raged around Canada, not around Germany and Hol-land.Tho MINISTER:  That is not the point.Mr. Deputy NEAL: Are we&apos; not getting rather away from the point, Sir? We are here simply to draw your attention to the de-liberate pledge which has been given.The MINISTER: I am coming to that, but there are one or two other things I want to say first. The Royal Commission was specially asked to deal with the whole question of live stock coming from any part of the world, and that is very important, because you cannot limit this matter to Canada.Mr. Deputy NEAL: There again w;e dis-agree.The MINISTER: There is no question about that. We have had many enquiries from other parts of the British Empire and other Domi-nions.A DELEGATE: -They did it before. Mi\. B&amp;iMe WALKER: Ireland is a foreign State to-day, in a sense.The MINISTER: I really camnot answer you, gentlemen, if I am not allowed to x^ooeed on my own lines.   1 do not know why there should be this interruption:.   You said many thiangs I did not agree with, but I did mot interrupt you. What I was sayinig was that you oaniraot limit this matter to Canada.   We have plemlty of evi-denoo of that, and that opens to door very wide, and&apos; the only criticism I will make of the Royal Commission here is that they did  not answer the quostioin we asked them.   But, in so far ais they made a Report, they inserted words which fully justified the Government in not taking action&quot; at the present time.   I think that passage in the Report has always been overlooked by you.   Shall I read it to you? &quot; The true question seems to us to bo what the facts really are, while we fully reoognlisc that what the farmers think may be a reason for some delay in takinig   action   if   Your Ma.iosty&apos;e Govoriniroeint think that this is do-siraiblo.&quot;I never hear that passage quoted. If there is meed of justification, you need, go no fuir-tber than that to find complete justification of the Govommenltfs action in not doing anything at the pretseinrt; time.Mr. Bailie WALKER: Whom did the Govern-ment discover that passage ?The MINISTER: Really, how caw you ask mie that? I read the Report before it was issued to the public, and it is embodied in the Report itsellf. Now, I will oome to what is called (( the pledge.&quot; Anybody who reads the White Paper can see perfectly clearly that no definite pledge was given at all.Mr. DcpuJty NEAL:   I dissent.The MINISTER: You have road it, but I will call your attention to certain passages. In the first rJlace, Lord Ernie was moist careful to say that he had! not consulted the Irish, Depart-ment.Mr. Deputy NEAL: I agree.Tho MINISTER: Very well! Tho Irish Department was vitally affected, and he said the ifiraish, Deportmeint Would have to be consulted, implying that no definite pledge- could be given umltil the Irish Department had been/ com-suHlted.Mr. Deputy NEiAJL: I do not thinik he said it had to be consulted. &quot; I am afraid1 I ought to consult.&quot;Mr. HENDERSON: We are not asking for the importation of Canadian cattle into&apos; Ireland.The MINISTER: But this was an Imperial Conforonico in 1917, when Ireland was part of the &quot;United Kingdom, and obviously no single Minister, whoso jurisdiotion only oxtonded over part of the United Kingdom, could pledge tibatel United Kimgdom as a whole, and he specifica^/ ) calls attention to the fact that he has not con-&apos; suited the Irish Department. But that is not all. A month after the Imperial Conference was hetlid I call your attention especially to these dates, the Imperial Conference was on the 26th April, 1917 in the House of Commons on May 25tih, 1917, which was just four weeks aftor, Lord Eraile answered a question by Sir Hamar Greenwood, and I know he answered&apos; it witlh that Conference fully in his mind. Ho said :*&apos;I cannot say whether or under what cou-cBtions Canadian cattle, as defined above, might hereafter bo. poTimdtted to enter this couinitry, except for slaughter at the porlts. At proseult, when farmers at home are bo-inig asked to reduce their livestock, permission is plainly impossible. But tho prohibition rests rather on the agricultural policy of the United Kiwgdom than on the. risk of disease, from which for many years Canada herself has been most reimarkably, if not entirely, free.&apos;&apos; Therefore, just a month after the Conference, he lays down that the prohibition -Mr. Deputy NEAL: But he did not say so atthe Conference.The MINISTER: It was always understood that the embargo would not bo removed&apos; till after tfho Armistice. Shortly after ittie Armis-tico, Lord Ernfle saw the representative of the Canadian Govern merit over hero for the pur-poise of getting the embargo removed&apos;. He gave an account in a speech in. the House of Lords: &quot; The dainger, as I have said, relpeded into tho badcgrotiaid.&quot; Whlat ho had in minld was that he thought wc migiht have to cut up our owfrt oattito to feed our own peoplo, owing to tho submarines, and that we should1 have to re-plonish our stock by importation from Oamiaida.Mr. DepuJby NEAL : He does not say a word of that.The MINISTER : He explained to tho Royal Commission why. He said: 111 did not say it because this was going to be a published&apos; dlacu-moirt, mind I did not dare tell the worlB what a danigcrous position wo wore in with regard to food during the war.&quot;Mr. Deputy NEAL: Mr. Hiazen said: &quot;I think, as wo have a statement from tho Prcsi-dent of the Board of Agriculture, that the re-strict ion will be removed, and that he does not see why it should mot be done at onco, we might leave it there.&quot; That was a moment after tho Chairman hind said, &quot;Mr. JProthero accepts that, and thorn is an end of ft.&quot;The MINISTER:  He said in the House of Lords:*( Tho dlaiinger, as I have said, receded into thie background, and after the Armistice, Canadian agents saw me in the presence of tho Parliamentary Under -Secretary of the Colonies, and I told them that the circum-stances bad changed., that the one ovormas-terinig pressure of necessity had gone, amd that I saw no reason why I should bo a party to altering our policy of the exclusion of Canadian cattle. I saw them on two subse-quent occasions. I fccM tihiem the same thing. I also mot a very important deputation, re-presenting alii parts of the country, on the question, of the admission of Oamadlian stare cattle. They asked for it, and: they contained a very important representation from Soot-land. I gave them the some answer. I told them that the circumstances had so completely chamigod that there was no reason to reverse our policy, and before I loft the Board in : June, 1919, I issued a notice in tho Press to the effect that the Board of Agriculture did ! - not intend to reverse- the policy.&quot;That is the man who is stated to have given.the definite pledge, which was binding on him and all his successors.Mr. Deputy NEAL: Lord Long said so. \ Tho MINISTER:   Lord   Ernie   was   neverunder the  impression that he was under aaiydefinite pledge whatever.Mr. Deputy NEAL: Then ho does not under-stand the British language.The MINISTER: You may criticise his policy - &apos;Mr. Deputy NEAL: I oritioiso his action. :   The MINISTER: Lord Enrale was a man of tho most unimpeachable honour, and Lord Lee and I have consistently acted on precisely the
34same lines. Something was said about a letter of Sir George Perley. You will find the eor-respoaidence between Lord Lee and Sir George Perley, in which Lord Lee reaffirmed what lord Errale had said, and I submit it is pushing *:;o thing very hard to suggest that a definite pledge was given. Neither Lord Ennio nor Lord Lee ever accepted it as such, and&apos; neither ever took any steps to remove the embargo.Mr. Deputy NEAL: How do you interpret that against the deliberate statement made by Lord Long the other night.The MINISTER: I am not responsible. Mt. Deputy NEAL:   But here it is.    You have the Prime Minister, on the 16th March, 19211, answering a question by Major 0&apos;,Neill: &quot; MAJOR 0&apos;NEILL: Can the Right Hon. Gentleman say whether this pledge was given with Cabinet  sanction,   and in - any  event what is the effect of a pledge given in this way at a Conference by a Minister, which pledge, to be carried out,   requires   subse-quent legislation?.&quot; The PRIME MINISTER: I agree. It was -given definitely by the then Colonial Secre-tary, tho Right Bon. Member for St. George&apos;s (Mr. Walter Long) and the present Lord Ernie, who was then Minister of Aigrioul-ture. Both gave very definite pledges on behalf of the Cabinet. I agree it is a matter for the House of Commons to decide, and if the House of Commons is to consider the question, I think it would he very consider-olbly assisted by a perfectly impartial inquiry.&quot;Now, Sir, in tho face of that and the evidence you have read, how on earth you can suggest  -well, I am astounded.The MINISTER: If that was a definite pledge, why was the Royal Comimission ap-pointed at all to ascertain whether the fulfil-ment of the so-called pledge would or would not  affect injuriously British agriculture?Mr. Bailie WALKER: The Prime Minister must answer that question, not us.Mr. Deputy NEAL: We did not ask for it. You accepted it on behalf of the National Farmers&apos; Union. Now you do not abide by the result of it.The MINISTER: Oh, yes, I do, but let me conclude one other thing I want to say. Let nolbody be under the impression that I am questioning the t sincerity of the Canadian people or Government. On tho contrary, I wish to make it perfectly clear, as I have before, that I understand the position)., and I sympathise with the desire to remove the em-embargo. I would go a long way myself to meet that, if I could, see how to do it without seri-ously injuring the industry over which I am the official head in this ooumtry. If I thought I could \ do it without dealing a severe blow at British agriculture, I would go the whole way, but I am quite unable to see how that can be done. But as regards Canada and what her attitude has been, nobody can throw a stone at Oanada&apos;s attitude in the matter. It has been perfectly correct, and I say emphati-cally she has in her Veterinary Department shown extraordinary skill and efficiency,  and kept the country wonderfully free from disease. The three great plagues which affect cattle  cattle plague, pleuro-pneumonia, and foot-and-mouth she has been- absolutely free of, as far as I know, for the past twenty-five or thirty years. But I cannot see myself that it would be anything but a retrograde step to destroy this position of island isolation, which we have got. Therefore, as I speak and I must speak  as the official head of British agriculture, I do not see my way to take any honest or honourable course, except as I previously stated, to speak and Vote against the resolu-bion.Mr. Deputy NEAL: I thank you, Sir, on behalf of the members here, but I take it now that you are still of opinion, that no definite pledge has been given, because otherwise you would have agreed to what I said when I opened these proceedings and referred tc. tho statement you made at the Constitutional Club. I, therefore, assume and X think m I have a right bo assume-you still maintain that no pledge was given. It is no use for me to argue that further. But we have now, I think, come to grips in this matter. Argu-ment is a thing of the past; action must be the thing of the future, but, we part to-day in this room as good friends, I hope, as we have always been.The MINISTER: Hear, hear.Mr. Deputy NEAL: But we part here as representing the great mass of the people of this country (hear, hear) ^and we shall go forward to the General Election, and make this the cardinal issue on that day. I thank you very much.Mr. HENDERSON: I have hee-n in this from the beginning in 1892 when the cattle were shut out, and we helieved it only wanted a few months before they were let in again. You say you have followed your predecessors. I d&apos;o not see how you can say that, Sir. Lord Ernie gave a most definite pledge, and he based it on this ground, that tho supply of store cattle had, not been adequately met for many years.&apos; He said the supply of Ireland was decreasing, and would continue to de-crease, and he was- arguing entirely from the farmers&apos; point of view. Further, he said at the Royal Commission that he would feel in-definitely safer in taking Canadian cattle - than-Irish from the point of view of disease. (As to the impartiality of the Royal Commission, did we get it? Lord Fimlay as a politician was pledged against removal of the embargo, and the Irish Department were allowed to pay their own expenses out of the Govern-ment pocket. It amounted, I think, to  1,800, and we had to find1 our own expenses.Tho MINISTER: ,The Scottish Board of Agriculture, gave evidence on your side; no doubt, that was not paid for out of private pockets.Mr. HENDERSON: We paid for the counsel and the whole of the expenses, and I have a letter in my pocket from the Secretary of Scotland to see him again about it. They have not paid a shilling.The MINISTER: I do not think my De-partment paid the expenses of any counsel.Mr. Deputy NEAL: No, but you paid the cost of taking this Department to give evi-dence on one side.The MINISTER: There is nothing in that.- Mr. HENDERSON: It was the counsel for whom we were paying, and our expenses were made twice as great by the- fact that there were two counsel against, us: one paid&apos; by the Government and tho other paid by English interests.Mr. Deputy NEAL: We know it was paid out of public funds.Mr. HENDERSON: So far as I know, there is not one of the Scotchmen who is not in. favour of the removal of the embargo. i It is no use blaming it on tho farmers. It is not the farmers who are opposed to it. We be-lieve it is Lord Vestey and the meat trade.Mr. D. ROSE, jun. (City of Birmingham): May I also thanfc you, Sir, for the very mode-rate manner in which you have received this Deputation. I come from an industrial centre, and we have to go to the people and ask for their support on this question. Industrial centres feel undoubtedly that an increase of fresh meat has something to do with this ques-bion. We think the men in those oonstitu-encies will have confidence in that, and will listen bo it, and we shall have to preach that doctrine to them. As I have said, we tho-roughlly appreciate the way you have received us and your loyalty to the agriculturists, but as the industrial population of the country we shall do our best to support the Canadians.Mr. Alderman HORNBY (City of Manches-ter): May I thank you, Sir, very much, as representing Manchester? We have killing wharves at Manchester, on which we have spent  100,000, and we have statistics which differ from yours, as shown in the Reports of the Manchester Markets Committee and their officials.&quot; The experience of the Markets Committee and their officials regarding the condition of the cattle imported to Manchester from Canada and United States, and the records of the Department, show bbat 152,212 Cana-dian oabtle were imported at bhe Animals Landing Place ab Manchester between 1896 and 1911 (inclusive), and thut in no single instance was contagious disease discovered or even suspected amongst the anlmia-ls.&quot;The Manchester Corporation have passed reso-resolutions on this subject, repeated at every op-opportunity presented to them, and they have passed them unanimously. Also the Nor-thern market authorities, representing a teem-ing population of industrial centres of between five and six millions, aro anxious to have fresh meat, because the workers are able to do their work better on it, and it is more appetising. I feel I ought not to leave this conference without pointing out that I shall have something to say to them oh what has occurred to-day, and I assure you they will not be very well pleased when I am compelled to report to them the views expressed by your honourable self.The Deputation then withdrew.Printed by W.
