THE 0Q13KWISTSThe Party Commission -has now come to the constructive side of its work and is dealing with the -specific application to the British Conuaunist party of the &quot;Decisions of the Third Congress of the Third International&quot;:   this week an important document has &quot;been sent to the existing divisions, from which, the following&apos; extracts are taken: &apos;&apos;       ;: -&quot;To the Divisional..Councils.&quot;In the thesis on organisation in the section dealing -with. Party structure, para. 44. will be founa the following passage:   1 The thing to be aimed at is- that every large city performing an economic political or transportation centre, should spread out and form a net of organisations within -      a wide area of,ihe surroundings of a given locality ana the economic political1 districts adjoining it. . The party committee of this large centre should  form::, .        the head of the general body of the party and &apos;  1 conduct the organisational activity of the districtdirecting its policy in close connection with the membership of the locality.1   &apos;&quot;In accordance with thie instruction the Commission wish to place the following suggestions to the present divisional executives, in order that ; &apos;.; they may be further discussed and finally drafted asa result of the further suggestions that may be made so that, the results reached can be placed before the &apos; -executive committee.;. .&quot;The idea of a district party committee is entirely a new thing so far as the English - revolutionary movement is concerned, and naturally there will be many opponents of it because it represents such a definite break .with past traditions and past methods of organisation.   When finally adopted it will be found that the D.P.C. is as .   important in its scope and functions to the district , to which it is responsible as is the BVG. to the Party nationally...      ,,    &apos; &quot;What is the essential, principal&quot; of the district party committee?   It Is, this;   That the D.P.C. is an actual directing committee operating in some important .. centre sucii as Manchester, Glasgow, or Newcastle, and . from that centre directing the activity of the membership In the district.     or this purpose the D.P.C has to be able to meet continually at the district oentre and therefore be chosen from members -        actually residing.at the. centre or in its injaediate neighbourhooa.;.&quot;    The district party committee is a leading oommittee working directly under the executive &apos; .;v arid&quot; rwith powers from, the executive committee.   Its members are elected by the district congress or representatives from the whole district but itspersonnel/
1personnel has te he sanctioned by the E.C. before it is constituted a D.P.C.     It reports to the B.C. and is re-sponsihle to it and constitutes the directing link between the E.C. and the membership.     The devleopment of the work t the membership along the lines of working groups and nuclei, reporting to and instructed by the D.P. C. in place of the present separate branch direction of groups and nuclei, will be the second stage of our work when the D.P.C. are set up,,&quot;The D.P.C. will be responsible for the setting up of an industrial sub-committee that will direct the activities of the party inside the unions and workshops in accordance with the instructions received from the Central Industrial Committee of the Party.&quot;During strikes and look-outs, it will be the district directing committee that v/ill instruct the party membership what attitude and policy must be adopted during the varying phases of the dispute. During such dispute the D.P.C. will at all times keep the party centre in direct contact with its district, thus ensuring the best centralisation of all our activities which will of course result to the advantage of the party. At all times through its close contact wit: the Party members involved in the dispute or working in th area where the dispute is taking place., the D.P.C. will lei the position of being in full possession of the facts relatp to the day to day progress of the struggle thus making it I possible for the work of the members to be organised, in I accordance with the real facts of the struggle.&quot;The members will easily see how the adoption of sucij form of organisation during the Miners1 Lock-out or Bngi-neers&quot; lock-out would have resulted in real effective worfcj the Party to its increased advantage.     At present aifferf divisions, different policies;   even towns in the same Division have different policies where obviously they ougfg to have been the same.&quot;What applies to work inside Trade Unions applies equally to other sections of the party*s activities.   Thii then means in practice that instead of the present Divisif Committees meeting at intervals, to hear reports of branc! without any attempt being made to organise activities of ( concrete character, the new District Party Committee, will the leading committee of that district, and its businesef be not only to hear reports but to assxme the leadership m the whole of the Communist activities in its distriot, m also be responsible for seeing that the membership assunsg their obligations to the Party.     In this way we shall m only make pronouncements on policy and direction but so JL organise the membership in the. varibuB: districts that bwT policy and direction will be effectively and efficiently! carried: out.&apos;.:AppliCiation to the Lancashire Division&quot;We have now to face the problem in what places Jftjr Centres can be established most effectively and the ao*f; area of membership that eaoh should cover.if    !
- s -&quot;In considering this problem we are faced at once with the special difficulty of the small and scattered character of our membership.    In a fully developed Party the whole present membership   of our Party would not be more than - sufficient to constitute a single good District in so far as numbers go.     On the other hand the area of an actual dis-trict must nave real compactness and unity, and not be a mere geogre&amp;fcical division, of a country...&quot;We haw carefully considered the problem of the.-&quot;   &apos; jjancashire Division and have reached the following provision-al results, on which we shall be glad to hear the opinion of the Lancashire Divisional.committee:-&quot;The natural district centres in Lancashire are Manchester and Liverpool.   ?faile a strong case might be argued on grounds&apos; of membership and the character of the region, for bringing the whole membership under the lead of Manchester, it seems clear from the information we have received, that Liverpool would not feel satisfied &amp;nA work best under the lead of Manchester,     We therefore suggest two; districts&quot;MANCHESTER DISTRICTCentre: Manchester: Comprising the existingfour branches, Openshaw, Gortoin,: Central &amp; Levens-hulme, the membership of which should provide a good District Party Committee and workingcentre; with headquarters at openshaw.Membership oovered - Members1 of the following branches:-Openshaw   &apos; Gorton     &quot; -J Central Levehshtalme South Salford Pondleton Ashton &apos; DuKinfield Olebam &quot;Rodhdale Bolton &quot;&apos; Tyldesley   - &quot; Leigh Wigan.

Warrington Earlestown.&quot;At a later stage we shall raise the question of possible unifications of groupings of existing &quot;branches. The Immediate questions concern only the finding of the right centres and the appropriate areas of membership...Applioation to the Scottish Division&quot;We haw carefully considered the problem of the Scottish Division and have reached the following provision-al results on which we shall &quot;be glad to hear the opinion of the Scottish Divisional Committee:*&quot;The clearly marked principal areas in Scotland at present are the Clyde and Fife.   Of these, Glasgow as the centre of the Clyde area should be able to provide one of the best working models of a District for the Party.   On the other hand, in regard to Fife there will be extreme dif-ficulty in finding an appropriate centre.    It would be obviously desirable to select a centre holding a dominating position within the Mining Area, but none of the.existing branches within the Mining Area appear strong enough to provide this, nor iB it at present by any combination of branches possible to achieve this s    In consequence it may be necessary to look to Dundee as the correct directing centre for the area.     On this, it is important to have opinions whether the area would accept the leadership of Dundee, and if not, what alternative could be suggested. It is probable that Edinburgh region, though small in membership, could be treated as distinct.     Aberdeen clearly falls outside any possible present Districts until such a time as it can develop a District of its own.   We should then get:-Centre:GLASGOW DISTRICT Glasgow:Comprising the present nine Glasgow &quot;branches. (Could these possibly amalgamate if Central Head, quarters could be found?)Membership/

For the direction of special questions affecting Scotland as a whole the Glasgow District Committee might have arspecial directing authority.&quot;
$he London District Council has put forward suggestions for 15 sub-sections: : the plans have been approved by the sub-executive of the Party, but have not been recommended by the Commission and may therefore be re-considered.The Berlin representative of the Young Communist Inter-national, who is at present in this country, has reported that the Communist Party &quot;has become sensible&quot; and that it is a pleasure to work with the officials,   &quot;the  arty is at present passing through a great crisis,   it is moving circumspectly which will mean that the English Party will at last be a party of the masses.   Until now it has had scarcely any influence on the masses with whioh it was not in sympathy,.. At a meeting yesterday I was amazed at the frankness and plain language of criticism employed in the Commissionss report, which will certainly result in drastic measures.&quot;Practically the whole of &quot;The Communist&quot; of July22nd was devoted to the Labour Party:   the one item that bears quotation is as under:&quot;We will urge and we shall get a united Working-class Defensive Front as the only possible check to the Capitalist offensive.&quot;We will urge and we shall secure affiliation to the Labour Party as an important contribution towards that unity.&quot;We shall work for and we shall:secure the electoral triumph of the British Labour Party as a means of enabling the British workers to pass from the defensive to the offensive and so give an impetus to the workers&apos; struggle in the whole of We stem Europe. v&quot;And we shall do all this confident that thereupon will ensue a situation from which the British workers, with the Communist Party at their head- will emerge the triumphant upholders of the British Soviet Republic.&quot;A National Women*s Committee, has&apos; been&apos; set up consisting of:Olive Bttdden ,      .........Mrs.:Jaoks&apos;on&apos;&apos;&apos;:       -!        .       \ - Miss Morgan   :Mary Mhorhouse- Mrs.Packman -        : &apos;;&quot;yt&apos;;&apos;&apos;v-&quot;-&quot;Helen Crawfurd. &apos; &apos;The/
The following are to act in a consultative capacity:- Mars.Bamber - ........Mrs.Chappe11 Mrs.5Jb.omas Ellen WilkinsonTom Bell is expected to take up bis duties as national organiser shortly:   Albert Inkpin has gone to Paris and after travelling on the Continent for about a month will also resume his duties as national secretary.W.P.Coates, of the &quot;Hands off Russia&quot; Conmittee, arrived at the Hague on July Oth:   he was received that evening by Levidoff and Krassin, and subsequently made frequent visits to the Russian delegates*According to the issue of &quot;^e Bradford Pioneer&quot;, dated July 21st, 1922, Mr,lrEstrange Malone, M.P. for Leyton, has joined the Independent Labour Party.C.M.0&apos;Sullivan, the Irish communist in London, is the Publicity agent for the American Industrial Workers of the World. &apos;&quot;&apos; ;&apos;,v::Jack Tanner has arranged for various communists to sail in arcos ships:   Charles Beech and James Sherbum are believed to have sailed and Tom $aelohrs brother and &quot;Young Larkin&quot; are expecting employment as firemen on the ice-breaker &quot;Lenin&quot;.&quot;: - Sylvia Pankhurst&apos; has recently Informed a Dutch extremist that:Vi&apos;;;;;:&apos;&quot;1&quot;There are several movements towards industrial unionism growing up here, and various groups wanting to form a One Big Union, but none are yet bo advanced as one would like.   Nevertheless, there is a growing body of opinion in that direction, also in the direction of oommunism, but of oouree there are very few real oom-raunists yet... &quot; &quot;&quot;The Printing Press has just got a large work to do. Otherwise there was no prospect of paying the balance of the rent within a reasonable time, to say nothing of other liabilities.    It was really looking like the end,   , but now we have another lease of life]&quot;CO-OPERATION/
CO-OPERATION OF ENGLISH AND IRISH COMMUNISTSOn July 14th, R.Connolly and G.MaoLay of the Irish Communist Party attended a secret meeting of the sub-executive of the Communist Party of Great Britain:   the following re-solution was adopted and MacManus, Brown and Jackson were appointed to work out the details of the programme:&quot;That the sub-SxecUtive Committee, with the representatives from Ireland subject the whole situation In Ireland to an analysis with a view to working out a programme to. embrace the various classes end groups that make up the Irish people, particularly, a programme! that would cover the interests of the agricultural population:(1)   landed aristocracy*(2)   Graziers.(5)   Small farmers,(4)   Landless and half-landless peasantry.(5)   Agricultural peasants.(6)   Semi-proletariat(7)    Industrial proletariat.The programme of the Irish Labour Party to be subjected to a critical analysis and a programme of our own to be worked out.   This programme to be laid before the Republican forces in the field;    and the Irish Cornmunist Party and the Communist Party of Great Britai^ were to.support those forces vh ich accepted this pro-gramme.    In the meantime we were to criticise in a friendly fashion the I.R.A. and to urge upon them the necessity of supporting their objective revolutionary action with a programme.&quot;. ,The Issue of &quot;The Communist&quot; for July 22nd contained amanifesto from the Executive Committee of the Communist Inte.national &quot;To the Workers of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;:   thisdeclared that the Irish Labour Party was &quot;much too opportunistto continue the revolutionary traditions of Connolly and JimLarkin&quot; and that,&quot;It is only t^e Young Communist Party of Ireland w has the courage and: the determination to point to the ri path, and to say.Mt is only after the yoke of the Engli Imperialists has been shaken off that the struggle again the Irish exploiters, will have any chance of success J   Iis/
is only after the establishment of real independence that the class struggle will be able to develop untram-p  &apos;        melled by any nationalist question1.&quot;The attitude of the proletarian majority of the Irish Republican Army is a proof that the Irish Communist Party, notvdthstanding its short existence is on the right path and represents the will of the Irish working class.   The clearer and the more determined it pursues this path, the sooner will the English and Irish capital-ists understand that the large majority of the Irish people, the workers, are not inclined to have filched from them the fruits of a long and self-sacrificing struggle for the semblance of the independence which is being offered to them.&quot;The English capitalist class is fully aware of this, and at a mome.it when it sees that the Irish workers re-fuse to he swindled on this question, but demand from England a real free state, it will again land its troops in Ireland.    It is ready to renew the war rather than grant an independence which would interfere with its plans of exploitation.&quot;Workers of Great Britain!   Your duty now consists in frustrating this predatory campaign of your bour-geoisiel     Do not allow the Irish people to be subjugated once more by English capitalists!&quot;Workers and Peasants of ireland   You must be fear-less and determined in your struggle for the liberation of Ireland, and thus continue your fight for your own emancipation.   But you must bear in mind that liberation from the yoke of the English oppressors is only &amp; prelude to the great final straggle for the abolition of the reign of your own exploiters.   In this struggle the Irish Communist Party and the Communist International will assist you with counsel and action.&quot;In the same issue K*Connolly, J.J.0*Leary and G.McLay, who constitute the tutorial committee of &quot;The Workers1 Republic&quot;, announced that the paper has been unable to appear during the last two weeks as &quot;the fight against the Lmperlal-ist Free State Government has temporarily obligee&quot; us to con-cent rate on other aspects of this struggle&quot;.     The back page of &quot;The Communist&quot; is to be placed at the disposal of the Communist Party in Ireland during the suspension of &quot;The Workers&apos; Republic&quot;.THE YOW COMMUflloT LEAGUE   &apos;On July 12th the Moscow Executive of the Young Communist International sent to the Young Communist League detailed in-structions/
instructions regarfiing the forthcoming national conference:this document affords remarkable proof of the attentionwhioh Russian revolutionary organisations are devoting tothis country: -:&quot;We feel that we must call your attention to the tasks we think necessary for the near future...&quot;Comrades! \ A.start has been, made, the Young &apos; Communist league of Great Britain exists.     The first numbers of.your organ, on. the whole very good, show us that you understand our aim.     But there is yet. much more to be done,    There are&apos; too few in our organisation and too many outside of it.    The case should be the reverse^.    Hundreds of thousands of young workers are unorganised or passive or hostile to us or they.are in the bourgeois, militarist., religious or so-oalled non-...-political &quot;boy-clubs1 -&quot;Blood-sucking capital through the most shameful exploitation of young workers of both sexes, amasses fabulous proflt-a from these young slaves.    In the dock yards of Liverpool the position is such that even the capitalist press speaks, of &apos;slaveryBut the trade unions do nothing.&quot;. .&apos; In Tip ton young girls of 14 were employes at most dangerous work for a starvation wage of . 3 to 4.. shillings per,week, in the course of which 17 were ;.    killed..    There are numerous cases where young workers are exploited for..a wage of 1,2 shillings per week.   In the mines.the youths work night and day for starvation wages.    *The wages of. the ,agricultural workers are disgraceful1., writes the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.&quot;Young comrades!   These are the conditions under which the youth, of England lives.    This Is your task. Intensive propaganda for economic action, enlightenment ;   of the masses of young workers, explanation of their class position.    The Young.Communist League of Great Britain must at all times and everywhere stand forth as the representatives of the suffering young proletariat. .In accordance with the needs of the day the Young Communist League must start an intensive educational and recruiting campaign...^You must recognise that the youth are only a part of the entire working class and that our struggle . can only be successful if we fight together with the adult workers, shoulder to shoulder with the Communist . .. Party.    The Wakefield apprentices have set us an example. They declared themselves for solidarity with the locked-out engineers, they realised that the interests of the adult workers were their Interests too.   This is as it should be.   But this must not remain the sole example..-..&quot;The prospects for a mass movement are no where so good as in England.   You have no other proletarian youth organisation in your country.     The various bourgeois   -organisations.cannot and do not want to help the young exploited workers.    They draw them into their groups
- 11 -16and sections only to isolate them from the struggle of the working class and to educate them to &quot;be instruments of imperialism,.. .....&quot;Is there peace to-day? &apos;;No, comrades.     In spite of all the nonsense talked about disarmament, in spite of the Washington Conference, war is still being waged. - The imperialists of all countries are preparing for new i   -    wars.     The aray budget for 1922/23 is  127,183,70.0 as against  79.385,000 for the year 1913/14.     On the air^orce alon&amp;  10,895,000 have been spent.   The,next great war is to be a war in the air.    In South Africa it has already been tried.   AeroixLanes dropped bombs on workers who had dared to strike- not only on men, but on women and children too.   In India and Egypt as well as Ireland the British army is fighting.   The machine guns . which are being directed against your colonial brothers who are fighting for freedom will be later turned against you.   The bombs that were dropped on the striking workers of Johannesburg may also be your lot.&quot;Comrades, all this should be a warning to you.   The big fight should find you prepared.   There is still time for preparation.   You must build up your: organisation and spread its influence among the masses...&quot;These are a few of the many questions that should be discussed at this conference.   The children&apos;s sections are another important cmostiou.   The formation of children1 s groups, how to gain influence in the Socialist Sunday Schools?   Especially the problem of anti-militarism, at the present moment of extreme importance, organisation of young agricultural workars and of the highest importance, propaganda in the colonies.     -&quot;The position is becoming more and more unbearable. In this process of increasing misery, the youth suffer most.We must make the greatest efforts in the interests of the young workers to save them from increasing misery, to prepare them for the great struggle which confronts the working class and for this we must have in England an organisation of young workers, strong, disciplined and ready for the fight.     ,     -. . - r . ,&quot;These are the great tasks of the British Communist fouth,.   We are convinced that you will form a united front of workers both young and old and together with the Communist Party of I4reat Britain-will overcome all obstacles and march onward to success.   Then our victory is-assured.&quot;&quot;George Brown&quot;, the British representative of the Young Communist International, arrived in this country on July 18th and has sent a number of reports in German to headquarters regarding the position of the Young Communist League.   He is apparently leading a hole and corner existence, owing to the fear of detection and his German mind seems shocked by the disorder prevailing at 35, Gray&apos;s Inn Road.     &quot;Buried under dust
and all kinds of rubbish lies the correspondence between the Berlin 3ureau and the League:   I found several of our secret documents among all kinds of rubbish and am now sorting them out.     You have no idea what such a secretariat looks like:   we have to put tilings in order before we can work.     Letters from us and from the; publishers are lying higgledy-piggledy, buried in dust.&quot;The Young Communist; League has received a communication from J. Ungerson, Johannesburg, in which he states that a Young Communist League has been organised in South africa as a direct result of the recent events on the Hand:   thefirst meeting was to be held at the beginning of June andUngerson is anxious to receive a supply of British YoungCommunist League literature.THE BEL IflTERlUTlOIL-L 0*&apos; LABOUR UNIONSThe Second World Congress of the Red International ofLabour Unions is to be held in Moscow on October 25th, 1922:four British delegates are expected to be present.
