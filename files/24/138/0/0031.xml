This document i3 the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.      157SECRET.CP. 4131.THE CABINET.THE SITUATION IN ANATOLIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.In view of the telegram from Lieut.-General Sir C. H. Harington of 21st July regarding     121. the situation at Constantinople, printed as an appendix hereto, I circulate the following       3 memorandum which has been prepared by the General Staff, and which I ask should     2193 receive early consideration by the Cabinet.L. W.-E.The War Office, 29th July, 1922.1. The Stalemate between the Greek and Turkish Nationalist Armies.The Greek and Turkish Armies have remained on their present lines since October, 1921, and there seems no doubt that neither side is in a position to force a military decision in Anatolia. The prolonged cessation of hostilities has strengthened this belief, and has probably created in the minds of fighting troops a disinclination to resume active operations. On the other hand, a voluntary retirement by the Greek Army would be followed up with enthusiasm by the Turks.2. The Strength and Disposition of the Allies Around Constantinople.: Constantinople area BritishFrenchItalian Ismid Peninsula-British    ...       ...       ...    1 regiment Cavalry (less 1 squadron).2 battalions.1 brigade R.F.A.

Exclusive of the battalions at Chanak and Gallipoli, the effective rifle strength of the Allies is as follows : British    .........Under 2,000.French   ...       ...       ...   Not much above 2,000.Italian    ...       ...       ...   About 500.There are also three weak battalions of Turkish troops under the Constantinople Government. These might possibly assist in the maintenance of order, but it is improbable that much reliance could be placed upon them.3. The Reinforcement of the Greek Army Corps in Thrace. (a) On 1st July, 1922, the Greek forces in Thrace, Macedonia and Epirus were -Thrace and Macedonia IV Corps-16th Division at Gumufjina (180 miles west of Constantinople)14th   Division  at   Salonica (320  miles from   , . AAA  .n       jn     . i \ - r 14,000 rules and oo jjuns.Constantinople) ...       ...       ...       ... &apos;Adrianople Division at Kirk Kilisse (100 miles north-west of Constantinople);Epirus V Corps.   8th Division in Epirus ...       ...   3,000 rifles and 16 guns.On the same date, the troops in Old Greece were estimated at only 600. There were, therefore, no reserves available, unless fresh classes were called to the colours.(6) Since 1st July, 1922, a number of reports have been received showing that the Greeks are rapidly reinforcing their corps in Thrace. First, we heard that the 59th Regiment, together with reinforcements amounting in all to about 6,000 men, had arrived. Next, General Harington was informed on the 21st instant by Colonel Psallidas, Chief of the Hellenic Military Mission at Constantinople, that one of the Greek divisions from Anatolia had been transferred to Thrace. And we now learn that two Greek divisions, the 7th and 10th, both from the neighbourhood of Eskishehr, have been, or are in course of being, shipped to Thrace, via Mudania and Rodosto.It, therefore, appears that the Greek Army in Thrace may, at the present time, consist of anything up to 5 divisions, or 34,000 rifles and 94 guns, with a possibility of further reinforcement at a later date, including 4 classes of Navy, which are reported to have been called up for land service.4. Probable Greek withdrawal to the Panderma Smyrna area.Mr. Lindley&apos;s telegram, No. 250, dated 14th July, 1922, reports that recent meetings of the Greek Cabinet resulted in two decisions : (i) No Greek forces to be withdrawn from their present positions in Asia Minor forthe time being.(ii) The administration of a zone terminating at Smyrna and Panderma, and including the railway line joining the two towns, to be reorganized.Regarding (i), we are now informed that two divisions have already been withdrawn.Regarding (ii), Monsieur Sterghiades left for Smyrna on 14th July with the intention of beginning the reorganization of this zone at once. His idea was to give greater authority to local elements, both Christian and Mussulman, and to set up an administration, which would survive the evacuation of the Greek forces, and would provide a basis for some form of autonomous government.By retiring from their present line to the one proposed in (ii), the Greeks would reduce their battle front from some 500 to about 250 kilometres, and it is considered that this shorter line might be held by 8 divisions instead of the equivalent of! .14 divisions now employed in Asia Minor.Some of the 6 divisions thus set free might be disbanded so as to effect a financial
saving of vital importance to the Greek Government ; but two of them have already been sent to Thrace, and the remaining four may follow them there at a later date, thus raising the troops available for a move on Constantinople from 5 divisions to 9 divisions.5. The Possibility of a Kemalist Advance into the Bbusa Ismid Ahea.If the Greeks retire, it is estimated that the Turkish Nationalists could concentrate a force of 1 cavalry division and six infantry divisions in the Adabazar area within 15 days (strength 15,000 rifles and sabres with 20 guns).Also, without dangerously reducing their main army, which would no doubt follow up the Greek retirement, they would be in a position to detach an additional 6 infantry divisions (17,000 rifles and sabres with 60 guns) which could be concentrated in the Brusa area within 30 days.The presence of Kemalist forces on the shores of the Sea of Marmora, from Brusa to the head of the Gulf of Ismid, might be unpleasant for our prestige, but would not constitute a direct threat to the Allied position in Constantinople, provided that the Allies agreed to maintain a naval blockade along this portion of the Anatolian coast.It would, however, be possible for the Turkish Nationalists to use the Ismid peninsula as a line of advance against Constantinople, and, if they did so, this would constitute a direct threat against the Allied position there. In such an operation, the Turks would have only two good roads for the supply of their troops, of which one,, namely the road from Ismid to Scutari, runs along the coast the whole way and could be shelled from the sea. In combination with an advance by the Ismid peninsula, the Nationalists might also attempt to use the Black Sea, but the Allied fleets would, no doubt be able to deal with such an enterprise.It would thus be difficult for the Kemalists to maintain any large force on. the Asiatic shores of the Bosphorus, although it would be impossible to prevent small forces from reaching the Bosphoras north of the defensive position prepared by General Harington, which runs from near Beikos in an arc of a circle to near Maltepe.It therefore becomes apparent that although, as shown above, the Kemalists could spare 12 divisions for operations against Constantinople, it is doubtful whether they could actually employ more than four (about 10,000 rifles, 1,000 sabres and 40 guns) in such an operation, owing to the restricted area and the lack of good roads.The effective strength of a Turkish Nationalist force threatening the Allies in Constantinople would therefore be relatively small, but, to meet this threat, the Allies could not count on being able to dispose of all their forces mentioned in paragraph 2, because the near approach of a Kemalist force to Constantinople would undoubtedly lead to risings in the city, where a considerable Allied detachment would probably be required to keep order.6. Alternative situations that may arise.From the above it follows that, even if all the Allied forces at present in the Constantinople area loyally co-operate with each other, they will be too weak to withstand an attack by either the Greeks or the Nationalists ; also that, since adequate reinforcement of Allied troops is extremely improbable, any threatened attack must be dealt with by other means.There are two possibilities : (a). A threat on the part of the Greeks alone. This can best be met by a counter-threat to bombard Athens from the sea, to blockade the Greek coasts, to sink the Greek fleet at Constantinople, and to exert financial and diplomatic pressure.   To all these measures our Allies would probably agree.(&amp;) A threat on the part of the Nationalists alone. This can best be met by a counter-threat to give the Greeks a free hand to march on Constantinople. To such a measure our Allies would certainly not agree unless great political pressure were brought to bear upon them ; but, unless they did agree, the position of all the Allies might easily become not only humiliating, but precarious. They would be liable to ejection by force of Nationalist arms, and it would be better that they should evacuate Constantinople before the threat is made, rather than court defeat by waiting till it is put into execution.(233)
In addition to the above, there is a vague possibility of a coup cle main by the Greeks, carried out after little or no warning, in a frantic effort to find a way out; of a situation which, for them, is rapidly becoming desperate.This possibility may seem somewhat far-fetched, but it is clearly indicated in Colonel Psallidas&apos; conversation with General Harington and is by no means out of the question.If the attempt were made, it would most probably be followed by immediate operations in the Ismid peninsula on the part of the Nationalists, with a view to threatening Constantinople. In this eventuality, the Allied Forces, caught between two fires, would be in a very difficult situation.7. Conclusion.Such are the military considerations brought into prominence by the most recent developments, as disclosed in General Harington&apos;s latest telegrams and letter, and it is strongly urged that these considerations should receive the early attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The General Staff are fully aware that political issues of paramount importance may hitherto have out-weighed all purely military issues, but in view of all the facts enumerated above, the General Staff&apos; feel that they should now be informed of the policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to pursue. A crisis appears to be approaching, and military preparations cannot be made unless that policy is known.It is the opinion of the General Staff that, standing alone, the British troops have an impossible task if attacked either by the Greeks or Turks ; and the task is not much lightened even if the French and Italians give us. their whole-hearted support with their available troops on the spot, though, if attacked by the Turks alone, the defensive line Maltepe Beikos, on the Ismid peninsula, might probably be held by all the available Allied force.They are further of opinion that for the safeguarding of Constantinople against a combined attack, or an attack by the Greeks alone, a reinforcement of two Allied divisions would be necessary, the British quota of which would certainly not be forthcoming.They further consider it essential that an assurance be obtained from both the French and Italians that they will give to General Harington their unqualified support, in any operations, whether against Greek or Turk, that he may be compelled to undertake.The questions that arise out of the above, to which the General Staff desire answers, are : (i) What action is General Harington to take in case of attack by (a) Greeks alone ?(b) Greeks and Turks ? ;(c) Turks alone ?(ii) Will our Allies whole-heartedly support a defensive action in all three cases if it becomes necessary ?
APPENDIX.TELEGRAM FROM SIR C. HARINGTON, 21st JULY, 1922.Indications here make me inclined to confirm some such arrangement as in Lindley&apos;s wire to Foreign Office, dated 14th July, No. 250. I think Greek policy favours a ringed fence, probably Panderma Smyrna, followed by withdrawal from front areas, Brusa included. This might start in next 2 or 3 weeks. I shall be very sorry to see Brusa area becoming Nationalist. We might be seriously threatened by this. I should like to see an arrangement by which this area came under administration of Constantinople Government so that we could help to maintain order by raising gendarmerie, &amp;c, but I doubt if Nationalists would tolerate Constantinople Government administration and we are too weak to support with troops.Situation in Thrace demands attention. Am told that a fourth division is being sent to Thrace. Personally, I am not disturbed, as while British are here I do not think Greece is foolish enough to try to take Constantinople by a coup. There is no doubt that French, Italian and commercial firms are apprehensive. They evidently suspect that such a movement would receive acquiescence of British. You must realize that British rifle strength (less Chanak Battalion) is under 2,000 and force is practically immobile. It has to be prepared for two important tasks (a) defence of Maltepe line in Asia against Nationalist advance fro-a Ismid with support of French brigade which is extremely doubtful ; (&amp;) defence of Chatalja or other lines in Europe against possible advance on Constantinople by Greeks.   I can only hold it ready for either task.It is conceivable that Turks might rise simultaneously, and in Constantinople itself there would certainly be trouble. French effective rifle- strength is not much above 2,000, Italian about 500. There are 3 weak battalions of Turkish troops under Constantinople Government. The best defence against Greek advance is threat to Athens. If it becomes serious, Greek concentration in. Thrace should, in. say opinion, be countered by removal from, this anchorage of Greek ships. They have in anchorage at present 1 battleship, 6 destroyers and (? several) small craft, and another battleship arriving shortly. I should be glad to receive any instructions of policy. My intention is to try, with vny limited resources, to stop from crossing the neutral line any armed force of Greeks or Nationalists. I am not anxious at present, but think, before meeting takes place in London, you should put military situation before Cabinet, in ease situation develops later on above lines.
