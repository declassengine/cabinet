DRAFT BSbPjtTOH.As Your Bxoellenoy is aware the general question of the French Debt to this country has not as yet been the subject of any formal communie&amp;tipn between the two Governments, nor are His Majesty^ Government anxious to raise it at the present moment.   Recent events, however, leave them little choloe in the matter, and they feel compelled to lay before the French Government their views on oertain aspects of the situation created by the present condition of inter-allied indebtedness.Speaking in general terms the War Debts due to Great Britain by her allies amount in the aggregate to somewhat less than  2,000,000,000 or excluding Russia to about  1,300,000,000 sterling,    Ho arrangements have hitherto been made or suggested for the payment of interest on this debt, still less for any re-payment of capital.    Gn the other&apos;&apos;hand, Great Britain owes the Government of the United States of&apos; America a sum of about  850,000,000 (at par of exchange) together with interest aoorued since 1919.   On this sum interest has henceforth to be paid and it has to be converted from aa unfunded into a funded debt.These demands, which have been put forward with most perfect courtesy, are within the undoubted right of the American Government.   They were clearly contemplated in the original contract, and Great Britain, fully recognising the obligation, maxee no complaint of the procedure.But evidently this country crannot treat the praotical problem thus presented to it as if the transactions out of which it ar*se were isolated incidents in which only the United States of America and Great Britain have any concern.    &apos;J?hie country has been asked to meet its obligations as a debtor and it proposes to do so..     But it /cannot
!,, &apos; . . 53cannot forget that it is not only a debtor hut a creditor, and that, if the obligations are to be enforced, the rights cannot be left wholly in abeyance.His Majesty1 s Government do not conceal the fact that they adopt this change of policy with the sr-?rvo-ot t rogrcet . - It is true that Great Britain is owed more than it owes, and that,&apos;if ali inter-allied -war- debts were paid the British&apos; Treasury would, on balance, gain by the transaction.   But His Majesty&apos;s Government have always&apos; doubted -whether the present world situation could best be treated from this narrow financial standpoint.&apos;  It is true that many of the Allied and -Associated Powers are 3. as between each other , creditors, or debtors, or both.   But they were, and are, much&apos;more.   They were partners in the greatest inter-national effort ever made in the cause of freedom; and they are still partners ih dealing &apos;wi&quot;th some, at least\ of its results.   Their debts were incurred, their loans-were made, not for the separate advantage of particular states, but for a great purpose common to them all, and that purpose has been in the main accompli she dj.To generous minds it&apos; can never&apos;be agreeable, &quot;although, for reasons of state, it may perhaps be necessary,&apos;to treat-the monetary aspect of this great event as a thing aparu, to &quot;be torn from its historical setting and &apos;regarded as no more&quot; than an ordinary commercialdealing between traders who borrow and capitalists who- lend.    There&apos; are moreover reasons of&apos; a different order which increase - the distaste with which His Majesty?s Government adopt so fundamental a-change in their policy respecting loans to &quot;allies.   The- economic ills from&apos; which the world is suffering are due to many causes, moral and      , .   - -material, which are quite outside the  scope of this despatch.   But among them must certainly be reckoned the weight of international   -indebtedness, with all its unhappy effects upon credit and exchange, upon national production and international trade *    The peoples of all countries long for a speedy return to the normal; but how can the normal be reached while&apos; conditions so -abnormal are permitted to prevail?   From this point of view, therefore, some general arrange-ment seems eminently desirable&apos;;  and  in the -leanwhile Great Britain has done her best to mitigate the difficulties of the presentsituat ion/
situation by making no claim upon those of heir allies who through their participation in the far are among her debtors.But this policy seerns only tolerable so long as it is generally accepted.    It cannot be right that one partner in the commOn enterprise should recover all that she has lent,  and that another, while recovering nothing,  should be required to pay all that she has borrowed.    Such a procedure is contrary to every principle of natural justice and cannot be expected to commend itself to the people of this country.    They are suffering from an unparalleled burden of taxation, from an immense diminution in national wealth, from serious want of employment and from severe curtailment of useful expenditure. These evils are courageously borne.    But were they to be increased by a one-sided arrangement which, however legitimate, seems on the face of it especially favourable to one of their associates in the great war, the British taxpayers would inevitably ask whether this burden can fairly be fastened upon their shoulders alone.To such a question there can be but one answer,  and I am convinced that allied opinion will admit its justice.    But, while His Majesty1s Government are thus regretfully constrained to request the French Government to make arrangements at their earliest convenience for dealing with Anglo-French loans, they desire to explain that the interest and repayment for which they ask depend not so much on what France and other allies owe to Great Britain as on what Great Britain has to pay to America. The policy favoured by His   Majesty!s Government is, as I have already observed, that of writing off,  through one great trans-action, the whole body? of inter-allied indebtedness.    But,  if this be found impossible of accomplishment, we wish it to be understood that we do not in any event desire to make a profit out of any less satisfactory arrangement.    In no circumstances do we propose to ask more from our debtors than is necessary to pay to our oreditaaco; And, while we do not ask for more, all will admit that we. can hardly be content with less. For it should not
be forgotten,  though it sometimes is, that our liabilities were incurred for others, not for ourselves.    The food, the raw material, the munitions required by the immense naval and military efforts of Great Britain were paid for* not by means of foreign loans, but by internal borrowing and war taxation. But a similar polldy was beyond the rower of other European nations.    Appeal was made to the United States of America, and in substance,  if not    injform, the United Stated insisted that, though our allies were to spend the money,  it was only on our security that they were prepared to lend it.E. Before concluding this despatch I may be permitted to offer one or two further observations, in order to make still clearer the spirit in which His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to deal with the thorny problem of international debts.F. This after all is not a question merely between allies. Ex-enemy countries also are involved; for the greatest of all international debtors is Germany,     How His Majesty&apos;s Government do not suggest that, either as a matter of justice or ex-pediency,  Germany should be relieved of her obligation to France or other allied states.    They oontent themselves with saying that,  so deeply are they convinced of the economic Injury inflicted on the world by the existing state of things that, Great Britain for her part would be prepared (subjectto the just claims of other parts of the Empire ) to abandon all her rights to German reparation and all her claims to repayment by her allies, provided that some general plan were proposed by which this great question oould be satisfactorily dealt with as a whole.     A general settlement would be of more value to mankind than any gains that could accrue evan from the most successful enforcement of legal obligations,(Intd. ).A, J. ;Ba17th July, 1922.
