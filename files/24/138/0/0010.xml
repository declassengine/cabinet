43ANNEXURE I. A. Proposals for Strengthening the Viceroy&apos;s Council.It is suggested that the following points are important: 1. India has a written constitution, which imposes on the Governor-General very definite duties.2. For most purposes the ruling authority in India is &quot;the Governor-General in Council.&quot; Though the Governor-General is not specifically required to be present at all meetings of his Executive Council, he must (unless away from the place of meeting, or ill) ratify by his signature (or record his dissent from) every decision taken by the Council.3. Any proposal to relax the intimate association between the Governor-General and his Executive Council would require a substantial amendment of the Government of India Act, and this must open up the question of extensive constitutional change in. the directions desired by Indian politicians.4. But the &quot;Viceroy can, under existing law, appoint any of the Members to be Vice-President of the Executive Council, and could, by changes in the rules of business, delegate to the Vice-President the consideration of departmental cases which now come to himself. (Even so, he could not divest himself of executive responsibility for the decisions taken.)5. Members of Executive Council are appointed (by unbroken custom, not by law) for a term of rive years, and are not appointed to any particular portfolio. In. practice, each Member is given charge of a particular department or group of departments, and is chosen with a view to his aptitude for or knowledge of that special work. But, so far as the law goes, every Member is appointed without portfolio and takes up such work as the Viceroy directs. (The position of the Commander-in-Chief on the council is exceptional, and does not seem to affect the point now in issue.)6. The Viceroy, in addition to his general duties of supervision, has always taken personal charge of the Foreign Department (frontier questions, and relations with neighbouring Asiatic countries) and the Political Department (relations with the Indian Native States).While it is essential that the King&apos;s representative should be in direct relations, with the Princes and Ruling Chiefs (so that the Viceroy could hardly divest himself of the Political Department), there is no obstacle to his delegating the Foreign Department to a Member of Council, and there is much to be said, on the merits, for doing so.7. The number of Members is not limited by law. At present there are (besides the Viceroy and Commander-in-Chief) six departmental Members of the Council. By law three Members must have a qualification of service under the Crown in India. (This &quot;service qualification&quot; was discussed at great length while the Government of India Act of 1919 was under preparation ; its abolition would be a deadly blow to the Services in India.) The present six Members are in charge of the following departments:   (1) Finance, (2) Home, (3) Land-Revenue, Agriculture and Public Works, (4j Commerce, Industry and Railways, (5) Legislation, (6) Education and Health.Proposals have been under consideration for some time for appointing a Member for Communications, who would take over some of the present duties of the &quot;Revenue&quot; and Commerce and Industry &quot; Members. Quite apart from this, the devolution of work to the Provinces already carried through makes it uncertain whether it is necessary to retain permanently in the Government of India portfolios for &quot; Land-Revenue and Agriculture &quot; and &quot;Education and Health.&quot;There would seem, therefore, to be no very great difficulty in retrenching two portfolios and substituting a &quot;Foreign Department&quot; Member and a &quot; Communi-ations &quot; Member. Pending the report of the Inchcape Committee it is difficult to say anything more definite on this.The Foreign Department Member would have a comparatively light portfolio, and might be Vice-President of the Executive Council.8. But the Indian element in the Executive Council, more than any other feature, presents practical difficulties. Since Lord Morley&apos;s appointment of Mr. (now Lord) Sinha as Law Member in 1909, there has always been one Indian
in the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council. As part of the Reforms, the number of Indian Members was suddenly raised to three. There is no legal provision for any racial qualification. An Indian official might fill one of the three posts reserved for permanent officials, and will no doubt eventually do so when &quot; Indianisation of the Services &quot; has gone further. But up to the present no Indian permanent official has been found suitable for appointment. The Indian Members have been, therefore, selected from among men prominent in Indian political life but entirely devoid of administrative experience. Their presence introduces into the Indian Cabinet a block of Members (a) less versed than their colleagues in administrative work, and ]ess able to get through departmental duties quickly and efficiently ; (6) rather closely connected by former political association with the elected Members of the Legislature ; and (c) almost inevitably disposed to take a view differing from that of their European colleagues, not only on racial matters, but on questions on which the Legislature is likely to criticise the policy of Government.The Joint Parliamentary Committee recommended that the number of Indian Members (previcmsly one only) should be not less than three. In face of this recommendation, and as a matter of practical politics, it would be difficult and invidious now to diminish the Indian element in the Council so long as the total number of Members is not reduced. But the present position entails the consequence that for three out of the six seats1 in the Council (all of which involve hard clepart-mental work as well as Parliamentary labours) the authorities are committed not to finding the most competent man, but to finding three Indians who can fill, the places without conspicuous failure. And the position is further complicated by the political necessity of including one Muhammedan in the Council if the Muhammedans are not to feel that they are excluded from their proper share in the Government.To sxim up, it is clear that the Yiceroy&apos;s Executive Council might be strengthened by any one of three alternative courses : .(a) The appointment of a new Member without portfolio to be Vice-President of the Council;(b) a new arrangement whereby the holcler&apos;of one of the existing portfolios should become Vice-Fresiclent with functions of general supervision ;(c) the creation of a Foreign Membership, carrying with  it the Vice-Presidentshipof the Council.There are, of course, various permutations possible, but, broadly speaking, these three alternatives seem to stand out.(a) A Member without portfolio to be Vice-President.Pro. (1) He would relieve the Viceroy of much work ; (2) and he would, if efficient, strengthen the Government in the Legislature by becoming Leader of the blouse.Contra.  (1) It is very difficult to fit him into the present Indian constitution.(2) Such a functionary will be necessary if the Viceroy becomes primarily the ceremonial head of the State (c/., a Lord Lieutenant of Ireland outside the Cabinet under the 19th century system, whose Chief Secretary was in the Cabinet). But under present conditions, which are still remote from those of Parliamentary Government, the Vice-President can hardly fail to be either an echo or a censor of the Viceroy.(3) The new Member would not relieve the Viceroy of the detailed work of the Foreign Department.(4) The new Member may not have a portfolio, but he must have some staff, which will inevitably develop into a department. And the functions of that department will almost inevitably cut across the business of other departments. Under Indian conditions continuous friction will follow and the net result will probably be a further loss of efficiency.(5) The position of the new Member, if, as seems to be assumed, he is sent from England, will in practice be peculiarly delicate apart from his relations with the Viceroy, for two reasons : first, that he must practically supersede the service Members, who will know far more than he can about Indian conditions ; and secondly, that he can hardly fail to be considered by Indians as a special liaison officer with the Home Cabinet, and, consequently either as an enemy to be regarded with acute suspicion or as a channel for going behind the back of the Viceroy, according to the nature of the case.1 Excluding that of the Commander-in-Chief.
(b) An existing portfolio to carry the Vice-Presidentship.Pro. This would disturb the present system less than either of the other alternatives. The Legal Member (incumbent of the post that Macaulay held in the Government of India) or the Finance Member, or, perhaps, the Industries Member, could, if a suitable individual was sent from home, be put in a position of priority. The Vice-Presidentship need not be attached to any particular portfolio, as, presumably, the man selected to be Vice-President would take the portfolio appropriate to his own experience and qualifications. (In practice the Legal Membership is one earmarked for an Indian, and the Industries Membership calls for technical qualifications. A Finance Member with English Parliamentary experience seems the most probable choice, at least in the first instance.)Contra. (1) This arrangement would not relieve the Viceroy of the Foreign Department.(2) The new Member would, especially if Finance Member, have a very heavy portfolio, and, especially if new to India, could not do much, if any, work outside the departmental and Parliamentary work of his own portfolio.(c) A new Foreign Department Member to be Vice-President;Pro. This would give the Viceroy real relief: the step is, in fact, long overdue, and would probably have been taken before but for the fact that so many Viceroys have had special knowledge of Foreign Affairs before they went to India. The frontier has in fact outgrown the control of a department the head of which can necessarily bestow only a fraction of his attention upon it.Contra. (1) It might be regarded as removing the Viceroy from his present very close touch with the Cabinet as regards external affairs. (But this hardly follows : the work of the Foreign Department is mainly occupied by d etailed Frontier questions, and the fact that he would have a Member in charge of his Foreign Department need not interfere with the communication to him from the Cabinet of information and guidance on our relations with the Foreign Powers.)(2) There might perhaps be more difficulty in finding a man for the combination in India of the work of Foreign Member, Vice-President, and Leader of the House, than for certain other combinations.It is very difficult to make definite suggestions at a moment when the whole framework of the Government of India is about to be scrutinised by the Inchcape Committee with a view to drastic economy. But it can be said at once that the Vice-President without portfolio represents the most costly, and that the new Foreign Member probably represents the most feasible, of the three alternatives stated above.Appendix.Members of the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council (other than Military) appointed from home during the last 30 years.Name, Date.

ANNEXURE II. B. Proposals for strengthening the Staff of Members of Council-These may be discussed under two heads, as shown below : (a) Private Secretaries for Members of Council. -This is a comparatively small matter. The Llewellyn-Smith Committee on Secre-taiiat Procedure recommended the appointment of such private secretaries, and the Government of India, in a Resolution issued in 1920, endorsed the recommendation. A telegram has been sent to them (answer now awaited) asking for their views.It is clearly necessary to give the Members this assistance. Junior officers of the regular services should be available, and if it were laid down that the post of salaried private secretary to a Member must be held by an official, Indian Members would not he able to appoint unsuitable non-officials. There need be no invidious racial distinction in insisting that a private secretary with access to Cabinet papers mrust, under present couditions in India,, be a permanent official.(b) &quot; Council Secretaries &quot; to aid MSmbers of Council.This question has a rather controversial history. It was desired to create ih India Parliamentary tin d er- Seer eta ides on the English model, chosen from elected members of the Legislatures.,,The Government of India have always opposed this proposal as regards the Central Government, while not unwilling to let the experiment be tried in the Provinces. But Provincial Governors, while admitting the possibility of allowing a Provincial Minister in charge of a &quot; transferred subject &quot; (who is an elected member of the Provincial Legislative Council) to have a Parliamentary understudy, were inclined to take the line that a Provincial Executive Member in charge of a reserved subject (who is an official while he holds office) could not with advantage have a&apos; Parliamentary Under-Secretary under the &quot; dyarchy system,&quot; since this would entail the introduction into the sphere reserved for official, control, with which Ministers-themselves are not concerned, of an elected member of the Legislature.The main difficulty, however, is that no party system has yet emerged, and that every elected member of the Legislature must at present be regarded as a free lance, and not, as in England, as a member elected and pledged to give support to the Executive for the time being.This consideration applies to the Government of India, where all subjects are in the &quot; reserved &quot; sphere.If, as seems certain, an elected Indian non-official inember of the Central Legisla-fcure is under present conditions unsuitable for junior ministerial office, a &quot; parliamentary Under-Secretary &quot; must be sought from the other elements in the Legislature.These are: (1) Nominated Indian non-official members, of whom there may be 14 in the Assembly and 6 in the Council of State.These are generally nominated in order to give representation to particular communities or classes&apos;or interests Avho are not adequately represented by election, and their political position is practically the same as that of the elected Indian members. Sir M. Hailey suggests that some of these might become &quot; Government men,&quot; but if they did, would expect a promise of future preferment, e.g., as Pj-ovincial Ministers. But a Provincial Minister is a man selected by the Provincial Governor from the elected members of his Legislature, and must command the confidence of-that Legislature. It is difficult to see how the Government of India could promise such a post to anyone. It might, of course, be understood that a Government of India Parliamentary Under-Secretary who did well would establish a strong claim to become a Member of Executive Council in a Province or in the Government of India. But the offer of an appointment, under present conditions, would amount to a request to an Indian politician to abandon his independence and cut himself off from the body of Indian members, on the chance of getting an important fiye-year&apos;
appointment later on. An effective Parliamentary critic of the Executive would really have a much hetter chance of obtaining high office, if willing to accept it, than a &quot; tame &quot; member who had joined the official side.(2) Elected European non-official members, of whom there are nine in the Legislative Assembly and three in the Council of State.In practice these are not available they are professional or commercial men mainly employed in their own affairs, and attending the Legislature for a small part of the year to express the views of bodies like Chambers of Commerce.(3) Nominated official members (26 in the Legislative Assembly, 20 in the Council of State).These are members of the regular services, Europeans or Indians. They are either Government of India officials or representatives sent from the Provincial Governments. It is understood that the presence of so many Government of India officials in Parliament greatly hampers departmental work ; if both the Member and the Secretary to the Government of India have, as now, Parliamentary duties, the position is much as if in England both the Minister and his Permanent Under-Secretary were in Parliament.The official representatives from Provinces (12 in the Legislative Assembly and six in the Council of State), on the other hand, have not very much to do during sessions.   (In recess they return to their ordinary official duties in the provinces.)There would, perhaps, be certain drawbacks in selecting Parliamentary Under-&apos; Secretaries from among these officials  (a) The Provincial Governments naturally require their best  Parliamentaryhands for their own Legislatures ; (6) The Provincial officials would not serve continuously under the Governmentof India, both in and out of session, as the Secretaries to that government do now.;(c) The Secretaries to the Government of India would lose the experience of Parliamentary work which, heavy though it is, is undoubtedly Valuable to them.But these drawbacks may not be held to outweigh the still greater drawbacks of the present system; and if it is decided to be essential in the interests of good administration to relieve the Government of India officials of some part of their present volume of woi-k, the best expedient would seem to he to draw upon the official representatives sent by the Provinces to the Central Legislature.
ANNEXURE III.C -Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India as the steps to be taken in order to to improve the recruitment of British-born Subjects for the Indian Civil Service.I.The failure of the supply of European candidates is no new phenomenon, and early this year Mr. Montagu appointed a strong Committee, under the chairmanship of Lord MacDonnell, to consider the position.   This Committee has just reported.It found, that the disinclination to join the Indian Services is &quot; mainly due to the reports reaching this country regarding the feeling of men now serving in India,&quot; and that this feeling was due to three principal causes : &quot; the uncertainty of the position of the Services under the reformed constitution,&quot; &quot;the atmosphere of intense hostility created by the recrudescence of racial feeling,&quot; and &quot;insufficiency of pay and the growing expensiveness of life in India.&quot;The Committee noted that the progressive Indianisation of the Services was part of the avowed policy of His Majesr,y&apos;s Government ; that in pursuance of this, the percentage of Indian recruitment in the Indian Civil Service had been fixed at 33 per cent., to be increased annually by LI- per cent, until it reached 48 per cent, in 10 years&apos; time ; but while, on the one hand, the LVlontagu-Chelmsford Report had emphasised the importance of not suddenly swamping the Services, on the other hand the Committee held that &quot; no reduction of the sanctioned scale of recruitment of Indians can be made without exposing the Government to a valid charge of breach of faith&quot; before the expiry of the first decennial period. At the same time, &quot; any increase in the recruitment of Indians . . . must make the difficulties of recruitment more acute than at present.As regards the position of the Services in India, the Committee observed that apprehension was particularly prevalent as to the future of the District Gfficer, who used to be the pivot of the administration, but whose work is thought to be greatly changed by the reforms. The possibility that careers might be cut short by the progress of reforms ; that European officers would not be fairly treated by Indian superiors; that European doctors would no longer be forthcoming in sufficient numbers ; and that members of the Services and their wives and families would live in a perpetual atmosphere of racial animosity all these are factors in discouraging candidates from coming forward. Finally, there is uncertainty as to the wishes and policy of Government itself : &quot; Does Government really want more Englishmen to go to India ?   And, if so, why don&apos;t they say so ? &quot;The remedies proposed by the Committee may be summarised as follows : (L) &quot;Tbe Committee consider it now to be essential . . . that the Government of India should issue in due time and place an emphatic statement of their intention to support District Officers in the exercise of the legal authority vested in them for the maintenance of law and order.&quot;(2) Recruitment under the Indian Civil Service (temporary Provisions) Act of 1915 to supplement open competition, ex-service men being especially selected.(3) Improvements in pay, the right to commute the whole of their pensions (instead of one-third only), and compensation for loss of their career for those who retire prematurely on proportionate pensions.(4) Provision of more European doctors, housing allowances, and concessions in respect of passages.(5) Further retrospective effect to the concession recently granted of the refund of their 4 per cent, annuity contribution.(6) Propaganda at the Universities, and above all measures &quot; to remove the current misconception that the services of Englishmen are no longer essential for the welfare of India, and that Government does not very actively desire them to go there.&quot;(7) If possible the insertion in the covenants of members of the Covenanted Services of some guarantee as to security of position and pension.The Committee think that these measures &quot; will improve matters.&quot; The only alternative they can suggest is the appointment of a Royal Commission, but they fear that this will only stimulate racial feeling. &quot; But if the Secretary of State could see his way to making a Parliamentary declaration in supplement of the declaration of5570 C
20th August 1917, especially dwelling upon the gradual procedure prescribed by the declaration, and quoting the passages in the Montagu-Chehusford Report [on the subject of the recruitment of Indians], emphasising in particular the necessity for European association in the local administration, it would have a beneficial effect both in India and on recruitment in Great Britain.&quot;In a very important Appendix signed by all the members of the Committee except Lord MacDonnell, the signatories recognise that their proposals are merely palliatives ; that the provision of funds for them is &quot; in existing circumstances out of the question,&quot; and would, moreover, by adding to the cost of the European Services, stimulate the demand for more rapid Indianisation ; and they think that the real question is &quot; whether the Services, or at least some of them, may not have to be completely reorganised, and recruitment placed on a new basis, and those more especially in which the maintenance of a European element is not deemed primarily essential so recast as to adapt them to Indian standards of pay, on lines consonant not only with the new constitutional developments, but with the growing need for public economy.&quot;II.The Report of the Committee is noAv being examined by a Committee of my Council. It is obvious that it raises issues of first-rate importance which must be closely considered by the Government of India before the Secretary of State in Council can finallj&apos;- give his decision. No time will be lost ; but meanwhile I can only offer provisional opinions.(i) As regards the position of the District Officer, it is clearly impossible for Government to give an assurance which would have any validity that they will support him right or wrong. But there has possibly been a tendency recently to undermine the responsibility of District Officers by requiring reference to Govern-ment in matters which legally lie within his competence. That is a tendency which the Government of India might well be called upon to check.(ii) The proposal to. supplement open competition by special means has already been taken up, and the Government of India hope to ^recruit between 20 and 30 ex officers of the Indian Army tinder the Indian Civil Service (Temporary Provisions) Act. Appointments under this Act, however, must be completed by August 1924, and as men recruited under it will require at least a year&apos;s training, it wall only help us for one year more. It should be noticed that in this matter the Secretary of State for India is entirely in the hands of the Civil Service Commissioners, since by Statute no one can be appointed to the- Indian Civil Service except upon their certificate.(iii) As regards pay, the position is extremely difficult. On the one hand, it may be admitted that the Indian Civil Service, or at all events the married men, have some grievance. The pay was revised as recently as December 1919, and represents on paper a considerable increase on the rates previously in force. But it was fixed with the idea of a 2s. rupee, and the rupee (after rising for a short time to about 2s. bd.) is now below Is. Ad., and prices remain very high: the net result being that the Government of India have stated that it is doubtful if the average improvement in the financial position throughout the Indian Civil Service amounts to more than 8 per cent. It seems clear that the cost of living for Europeans in India has risen 60 per cent, since 1914. On the other hand, there are the two facts admitted by the Committee themselves : (a) That the present financial situation precludes any substantial increase in pay, and the Viceroy has recently so informed a deputation ; (?*) that any increase in the cost of the European Services would increase the political discontent and the demand for a reduction in their numbers. Yet European Services are essential, and if they are to be obtained must be paid at the market rate, and it may well be that the only escape from this dilemma is that hinted at by the Committee - a reconstitution of these Services on a smaller but definite scale, and on the rates of pay necessary to attract the best Englishmen to them. The question raised is so large that it seems useless to say more on it here. It will be examined with the greatest care and without any delay.(iv) The Committee ask for compensation for the loss of a career ; and others who have written on this subject have indicated that unless a guarantee against loss of career can be given there is no hope of men joining the Services. It is possible that there is some misunderstanding here. At present there is no question of compulsory retirement.   Indianisation is proceeding by limiting the recruitment of
Europeans, and those who are retiring from the Services are doing so voluntarily on terms which, though they do not include compensation, give to those1 who feel that they cannot conscientiously remain proportionate pensions to which they would not otherwise be entitled. The right of the Crown to dismiss cannot be abrogated, and will doubtless be used &quot;on sufficient occasion. It is being used now in the British and Indian Armies and in the Navy, and civilians can hardly expect a greater security of tenure than that enjoyed by their military and naval brethren. But if compulsory retirement is resorted to in such circumstances, compensation is practically inevitable.(y) The provision of European doctors presents two difficulties. At present the higher medical needs of India are met by the Indian Medical Service a military Service with a civil branch. This Service monopolises all the best medical posts in India, and in respect of no other is the demand for Indianisatiou stronger or more plausible dialectically. Indianisation is proceeding on the basis of 33J- per cent, in theory, but in practice the percentage is higher because British candidates are not forthcoming and the British vacancies are remaining unfilled. This is the second difficulty, and it may no doubt be partly accounted for by the readjustment in professional prospects which is still talcing place as a result of the war. So far as Indian conditions are concerned, itappears to be due, not so much to insufficient pay (for the pay has recently been increased by 50 per cent, and apparently gives satis-faction, at all events for the moment) as to the uncertainty of the future. Health is one of the transferred subjects ; in the provinces the civil medical officers already fihd themselves under Indian Ministers ; and how they will be treated remains to be seen. Apart from racial considerations common to all the Services, it is to be noticed that elected members of Indian Legislatures have begun to ask for Government recognition and support of the traditional Oriental systems of medicine, which are hardly reconcilable with modern scieuce. It is impossible to make any positive suggestion for remedying this state of things at present, but the vital importance of the subject is fully realised.(vi) It will probably be proposed to ask the Prime Minister to make a statement in the House of Commons ATery shortly with the object (among others) of dispelling the belief that Englishmen are not wanted, and of saying what can be said regarding security of prospects and pension.Such a statement, made by the Prime Minister, will doubtless be effective, and when the psychological factor in the discontent of the Services has been removed, or at all events abated, it will be more easy to judge the precise extent to which financial considerations are a factor in the unwillingness of young men to come forward. Of the measures of relief recommended by the Committee under this head, the two that would probably be taken up first, when the state of Indian finances permits, are the grant of free passages to officials and their wives and families when proceeding on leave, and some increase in the overseas pay of officials in their later years of service. But here, apart from the financial stringency, the Secretary of State is faced with the difficulty that, whereas the salaries of the All-India Services are under his control, allowances of every kind which cannot be brought within the definition of &quot;salary&quot; are subject to the vote of the various provincial legislative bodies in India, and an amendment of the Act will probably be necessary to enable the conditions of the Services to be improved in this respect without constant friction with the Indian Legislatures.If an all-round increase of salary is found to be essential the question will be raised which the Committee have indicated viz., whether it is not necessary to scrap the Services in their present forms and reconstitute them on altogether new terms to meet new conditions.   This would probably involve enquiry by a Royal Commission.
ANNEXURE IV.Memorandum by Sir Malcolm Hailey on the present Position as regards theDevelopment of India,It will for the present purpose be sufficient to consider the capital requirements of India in jrespect of railways and irrigation. Other requirements of course exist, for instance, in respect of port and hydro-electric development; but the former are capable of provision by the statutory Port Trusts, and the latter (where they are not already, as in the case of Bombay, being met by private enterprise) are not yet sufficiently explored to form an element in the present discussion.2. We have in India 37,029 miles of open railway; there are 39,000 miles in Canada (with its population of 8,000,000 against 300,000,000 in India) and 29,000 in Australia (with a population of 6,000,000). The Acworth Committee did not commit itself to any forecast of the fresh mileage required by India ; the Maekay Committee (1907) hazarded what seems to have been a speculative figure of 100,000 miles. It must in any case be admitted that there is scope for a great extension of railway mileage ; this is, indeed, of immediate importance in some of our coal bearing-areas. But our primary need, as the Acworth Committee emphasised in the strongest terms, is for the rehabilitation of our existing open lines. I note here that of the total mileage (37,029), the lines owned and worked by the State, or owned by the State and worked by companies on lease, account for no less than 26,652 miles ; the remainder are either company owned lines or lines belonging to Indian States. The finance for rehabilitation of this 26,652 miles must therefore be provided either by the State or by companies raising capital on behalf of the Secretary of State; there is in practical effect no very great difference between these two methods. Here, again, the Acworth Committee did not prepare any definite estimate of the cost of &quot; rehabilitation.&quot; Our own discussions with our expert advisers in India were admittedly influenced by consideration of our other capital requirements (e.g., repayment of short-term bonds, floating debt and the like), and were also perhaps to some extent influenced by the acknowledged difficulty of securing from the Indian Assembly a really liberal credit for railway capital expenditure. In the result, we ourselves accepted and persuaded the Assembly to endorse a &quot; rehabilitation &quot; programme of 100,000,000?. spread over five years. The railway authorities acknowledge that this will meet their more immediate and urgent necessities. It is probable that they could expend profitably a somewhat larger sum ;. but it must be remembered that the process of &quot; rehabilitation &quot; involves not only purchase of rolling stock, but doubling of lines, strengthening of bridges and remodelling of junctions. Whatever the resources provided, the process must therefore in any case be somewhat lengthy, and there would be no advantage in acquiring rolling stock in advance of other measures necessaiy to secure its efficient utilisation. The provision of 20,000,000 . a year is in gross figures a marked advance on previous standards, though its net effect is reduced by the post-war increase in prices. The Mackay Committee (1907) asked for 12,50O,O00Z. a year ; in the six subsequent years we provided an average of about 10,500,000L ; in the five war years ending 1918 we gave an average of about 6,000,000L ; in the last three years the expenditure has been about 14,500,000Z. a year. I must repeat that the provision of 20,000,000Z. a year makes no allowance for new lines, and unless finance is provided independently (e.g., by private enterprise) there will, on the present programme, be no addition of new lines in the next five years.3. As regards irrigation, our State canal system now develops about 2S,000,000 acres of cultivation out of a total cropped area for India of 212,000,000 acres ; this is about 13 per cent. We have schemes under consideration which should eventually more than double our canal irrigated area ; but it is only necessary to deal here with major projects which are so far developed as to require early provision of finance. The United Provinces Government has commenced construction of the Sarda Canal scheme (which should irrigate 1,750,000 acres); the Punjab has started work on the -Sutlej Valley scheme, intended to irrigate eventtially about 5,000,000 acres, including considerable areas now under flood irrigation The cost of the former is about 6,300,000Z. That of the latter is about 9,500,000L, but here only about one-third of the cost falls on us, the Indian States concerned being responsible for the rest. In Tooth cases the provincial Ciovernments should be able to obtain the necessary finance 5570 D
&quot;by local loans or sales of land. We have, however, also sanctioned the scheme for the great Indus Canal (the Sukkur Barrage) scheme for the development of Sindh, Including areas already commanded by flood irrigation, the area protected will be 5,300,000 acres, and the cost about 12,000,000?. The scheme presents some unusual difficrdties, for unlike other canal projects it will not return revenue until 10 to 12 years after commencement, and the accumulated interest charges will therefore-amount to some 3,000,000?. to 4,000,000?. The local Government (Bombay) has already heavy capital commitments in regard to its own town development operations, and its revenue position does not enable it to face the interest charges involved in the execution of this project.4. The directions therefore in which additional finance, if it can be secured, could promote the material development of India are threefold. First, the more rapid and extensive-rehabilitation of those railways which form a charge on the State ; second,, provision for the opening of new lines ; and third, the execution of such irrigation schemes as the Sukkur Barrage, for which local Governments cannot find their own finance. As regards the first object, we should have to persuade the Indian Assembly to extend the 100,000,000?. programme to which it has committed itself ; the same remark applies to the second object if finance is to be provided through the State. Incidentally though this, of course, is not a primary factor in thepresent discussion  I may remark that whereas railway expenditure benefits British industry, in so far as large quantities of railway material are obtained in this country, expenditure on irrigation projects effects little in this respect. They involve the purchase of comparatively little imported material.5. The bulk of capital necessary for railway development has hitherto been provided directly by the State. Taking the capital outlay on all the Indian lines as about 430,000,000?., the outlay on State lines (i.e., lines owned and managed or owned, and leased by the State) may be taken as about 380,000,000?.; this has been provided either by the State direct or raised through the companies holding leases ; for the present purpose I do not distinguish the two operations. Though there were initial losses, the investment has, in spite of the maintenance of very low traffic and passenger rates, for many years been remunerative to the State. It is true that in the last two years this position has been threatened by the heavy increase in working-expenses of all kinds ; thus the net result (?.e, the result obtained after adding the proceeds of the Government surcharge on goods traffic and subtracting all working-expenses and interest charges), which in 1920-2.1 was a profit of I-29 per cent., fell to a loss of 0&quot;46 per cent, in 1921-22. But we have now increased both traffic and passenger rates and calculate on a net profit of &apos; 85 per cent, in 1922-23 ; though there-fore an extended capital programme would present in the first instance heavy interest charges, embarrassing to us at a time when we are working to a revenue deficit, yet we ought eventually to be in a position to recoup ourselves by adjustment of rates and extension of traffic. Irrigation schemes have not suffered to the same extent as the railways from increase of running costs. We have three classes- (1) productive works, total outlay 38,900,000?., return in 1919-20 on total capital outlay 9fper cent.; (2) protective, outlay 7,500,000?., return on capital outlay 0&apos;37 per cent. (3) ; minor works, outlay 3,000,000?., return on capital outlay 8&apos;9 per cent. Allowing, therefore,, for interest charges, the net return continues to exhibit a direct profit.6. Assuming that it is desirable to engage on an extended, programme of development on the lines already defined, I come now to the method of providing the additional finance required. Without going into full details of oivr ways and means position in India, it will be sufficient to say that the bulk of additional resources required must be obtained from the sterling market. Though we now draw from the Indian rupee market sums which would have been deemed impossible,in pre-war years, yet our own commitments in regard to repayment of short-term bonds and floating debt (not to mention the finance of provincial and central deficits) are so great that the main burden even--of the programme to which we are already committed must fall on the sterling market; any additional assistance must certainly come from this source. Further, our present deficit position militates against our chance of reducing Indian market rates for money.. At the same time, it is difficult lo see how the Indian Government could contemplate placing on the London market a demand for sterling loans in excess of that-involved in our existing programme. It cannot be said that there has been in the last year any undue timidity in approaching London. In the 15 months which have elapsed since we reopened London borrowing we have taken 30,000,000?., and we may have to come on the market agaiu in the present year.   Our credit has of late
been shaken by the general mistrust or! political conditions in India ; we undoubtedly suffer also from the fact that the Indian Government has for so long a period been practically the sole borrower for India&apos;s material development, and this source of weakness has now been increased by the general knowledge that we have so large a programme of sterling borrowing before us in the next few years.7. Ruling out, therefore, the possibility of sterling borrowings by the Indian Government in excess of those to which it is already committed, it is advisable to consider whether the Home Government can give assistance in raising the necessary finance.   I take first the suggestion that the Home Government should guarantee sterling loans to be raised by us for specific development purposes.   The advantage is obvious, in so far as concerns our capacity to obtain money.on easier terms.   The objection, however, seems equally obvious.   In the past the fact that our loans are issued by the Secretary of State has probably influenced the English investor, though there has been no formal or statutory guarantee by the British Government.   To attach now a formal guarantee to certain classes of new loans would prejudice the status of all existing India sterling stock, and would equally affect our future issues not accompanied by such guarantee.   An alternative suggestion is that the Home Government should so extend its own loan or ways and means operations as to give a direct advance to India.   It will of course be for the Treasury to advise whether, in view of the necessity for funding British debt, such a proposal could be contemplated, but on the assumption that it is not impossible I venture certain observations.   I presume that we should not secure an advance of this nature on terms lower than or even equivalent to those represented by the charge on the Home Treasury without some definite quid pro quo ; doubtless this would take the form of a stipulation that all material required should be purchased in England.   When a similar declaration was made in connection with our 7 per cent, sterling loan of 1921 it evoked great opposition in India, partly no doubt on factitious grounds, but having also some real foundation in the fact that continental prices were at the time far lower than those which English tenderers could put forward. That difference has largely disappeared,, and the High Commissioner, though he now operates under rules which give him freedom of action in regard to his purchases, does actually place some eleven-twelfths of his contracts in England.   It is perhaps unnecessary to press here the economic argument that whatever the immediate use made of a credit granted by a country, it can only be utilised in the last resort by means of an export from or other service performed by that country.   Whatever the truth of that contention, the English taxpayer would no doubt urge that funds raised in India by the Home Treasury should be expended immediately in Great Britain.   As a matter of practical politics, the Indian Government would hardly be justified in entering on an operation involving the stipulation in question, unless there were so clear an advantage in interest rates that the operation would carry its own justification in India.   In that case it is doubtful whether, in view of the fact that we actually purchase already so high a percentage of our stores in England, the gain to England would outweigh the sacrifice of interest involved.8. The more obvious solution appears to lie in a third course, namely, the attraction of private capital on certain definite guarantees. I admit that hitherto the Indian official attitude has been rather in favour of direct financing through money raised by Government. There have been many reasons for this. The credit of the Government stood high, the somewhat limited sums which we decided to utilise were raised at low rates, and the resulting investment was profitable to the State. Again, the retention of control in the hands of the State was not without advantage in the case of railways, while the case for control was even stronger in regard to irrigation works. But the demand for &quot; rehabilitation &quot; and the necessities of our ways and means position have now forced us to become borrowers on so large a scale, and our revenue position is so far inferior to what it was, that the situation has altered. Taking the same classification of works as that already adopted, I would suggest that (a) as regards &quot; rehabilitation &quot; certain portions of the work, e.g., the electrification of the Bombay suburban railways, should be opened to contract-that is to say. that the contractors would find their own finance by issues guaranteed (in the case of English tenderers) by the British Government. It would suit us best in India that the terms should provide for repayment over a somewhat extended period, but I fear that this would, even if feasible, be so expensive as to make the scheme impossible, and the best we could ask is that repayment should not commence until the elapse of the five-year period represented by our present programme. The Indian Legislature 5570 E
would be asked to agree that works so executed should stand outside and in addition to the programme already accepted. Admitting that this method of finance would be somewhat more costly than by direct State borrowings, yet it would allow of more speedy rehabilitation, a matter of great importance, (b) I hesitate to enter here on the , T .,. r,      T question whether,; when the leases of our Indian1 iiast Indian,  1924:   Great  Indian        -i -       i- n   -   i l r  &apos;Peninsula, ]925. Six others at intervals ra  way companies fall in &apos; we could secure up to 1950. relief from part of  nur difficulties  by trans-ferring the lines to real companies, capable of taking over some considerable part of the existing capital charge on the undertakings and of raising independently such additional capital as may from time to time be required. Existing companies are only leaseholders, entitled, in view, of the small additional capital raised by them, to a share in profits which in some cases is as low as one-twentieth of the net revenue of the undertaking. Indian sentiment is entirely in favorir of taking the lines under State management when the leases lapse, being perhaps ignorant of the disadvantage to the State of, saddling it with the provision of the whole of the finance required. But Indian opinion has the support of a number of the members of the Acworth Committee; and on practical grounds it would be difficult now to find investors willing to produce the sums required for the purchase of any considerable share of these railways from the State. The capital value of the undertaking of the eight guaranteed companies is about 265,000,000L, and even admitting that the process of &quot; company making &quot;would occupy about 28 years, yet the burden of finding funds in the next three years to take over the East Indian and Great Indian Peninsula Railways on anything like a true company basis would probably militate against the future success of the scheme as a whole. If we are (in view of the opposition of Indian opinion to British domiciled companies) to restrict ourselves to companies of Indian domicile, the difficulty is still further increased ; for the company of Indian domicile would secure little or no support in London. The whole question is now being investigated by the Indian Government ; and I suggest that, failing the possibility of transferring these lines to true companies, it might be considered whether they cannot be handed over to statutory bodies analogous to the Indian Port Trusts. It is true that if this were done money would have to be raised on a debenture instead of a profit-sharing basis, since the directorate would consist of trustees and not proprietors of the undertaking, even in part. The relief to our capital difficulties would therefore be less than if money were raised by true companies against the profits of undertakings owned by them. There would be a closer analogy to the ordinary loan operations of Government, since the security in both cases is the same, i.e., the general&apos;assets of the Indian Government, but there might nevertheless be an appeal to a different class of investor. I admit that this advantage would have to be paid for, since the Trusts would have to pay somewhat higher rates for their money than Government itself. This scheme would require legislation in order to give the management general powers to raise money without executing a forma.] trust deed to secure the rights of debenture holders, (c) As regards new lines, our present difficulty is that private capital will not come forward save on the guarantee by the State of a somewhat high minimum rate of interest. We lately failed to secure the execution of a small but apparently very profitable railway extension in the coal area, though we offered a guarantee of 6 per cent. 1 do not know how far the British Government would, in view of the gain to British industry from the purchase of. British railway material, be willing to guarantee assistance to British contractors undertaking to construct new railways and to finance construction up to the date of completion, or at all events up to the end of the period ending 1927, coinciding with the termination of our commit-ments on our present programme. I suggest, however, that this is a question which should be explored. Assuming that the financial terms were not unduly onerous, there would probably be no &quot;political &quot; objection to this course on the Indian side, since the State would eventually be in a position to takeover the proprietorship of the railways, (d) As regards irrigation works, I suggest that efforts should as a beginning be made to interest British contractors in the Sukkur Barrage scheme. I have explained already the difficulty connected with the financing of this project. In view of the fact that the expenditure will be incurred almost entirely in India, it would be difficult to propose that the British Government should give any assistance in securing the necessary finance. But I suggest that execution of the work might be secured by the guarantee on the part of the Indian Government of a comparatively low rate of interest during the process of construction (such payments being treated if necessary as an advance from the Central to the Provincial Government) and
capital repayment being effected by the ordinary borrowings of the local Government when the scheme began to return revenue. I do not suggest any scheme based on giving the bondholders a share in the profits of the undertaking, though this might at first sight seem to offer some attraction. The difficulties are great. Revenue policy, on which the rate of return mainly depends, may in the future be even more largely controlled than at present by the local Legislative Council; the calculation of net profits rests on assumptions which it would be difficult to explain to the investor ; and it might be as hard on the one hand to persuade India that the cultivator was not being exploited for the benefit of British bondholders, as on the other to convince the investor that his profits were not being curtailed in the interests of a &quot; popular &quot; revenue policy..9. I must apologise for the somewhat general nature of this memorandum, written as it is in the absence of papers which I should have wished to consult. It represents, of course, views which I have been unable to place before the Indian Government, and are necessarily, therefore, entirely personal.W. M. Hailey.
