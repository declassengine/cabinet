This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.1SECRET.ICP. 4134.THE CABINET.REPORT ON THE SITUATION IN IRELAND FOR THE WEEKENDING 22nd JULY, 1922.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate the report on the Irish situation by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Ireland, for the week ending the 22nd instant.(a) Dublin. Although there has been a slight increase in the amount of sniping at night, the situation in Dublin City has been quiet during the week.No importance is attached to this shooting, which is partly due to nervous sentries in the barracks and posts held by Provisional Government troops and partly to sniping by Republicans at Provisional Government barracks. A certain number of shots, however, fell during the night of 23rd/24th July in the British camp at Phoenix Park, and a soldier of the Worcestershire Regiment was slightly wounded by a spent bullet near the Royal Hospital. Whether these shots were &quot; overs &quot; from the town or sniping from Inchicore District has not yet been ascertained ; but the Provisional Government authorities have promised to deal with the matter.Some instances of friction by British troops being held up by tactless and in some cases inebriated Provisional Government picquets have occurred.The proclamation by the Provisional Government published in the Dublin newspapers of 19th July to the effect that there was no intention to compromise and that it was determined to suppress outrage by force and not by concession, will doubtless have a good effect in1 the districts under the control of the Provisional Government. This confirms the statements made to the Press representatives by the Provisional Government authorities, as reported last week.One of&apos; the difficulties of the Provisional Government is the circulation of official proclamations, newspapers and propaganda to the country districts in the west and south-west, where the inhabitants are in entire ignorance of the true state of affairs and the victims of alarmist rej)oi*ts of Republican origin.It is reported that the aeroplanes recently handed over by the Air Ministry, and those otherwise acquired, are to be used for dropping propaganda leaflets.One of the two aeroplanes recently banded over at Collinstown has crashed near Naas, the observer being badly injured. It is doubtful if the machine can be repaired, as the technical side of the Provisional Government aerodrome at Baldonnell is at present non-existant.(b) Outside Dublin.-The fighting during the week has centred round Waterford, Limerick and Castlerea. The Provisional Government troops have, after a week&apos;s fighting, occupied all these places, the Republicans having withdrawn into Co. Cork, Kerry and West Mayo. The extent of the damage done to these towns can only be gathered from the Press ; in Waterford the gaol and barracks have suffered from shell fire, and in Limerick the new barracks are reported as totally destroyed by fire, Strand Barracks being badly damaged.L. W.-E.The War Office,28th July, 1922.Southern Ireland.
The casualties on both sides appear to be slight. In the Limerick fighting the Provisional Government troops had 6 men killed and 20 wounded ; of the- wounded 7 were officers.Cork City is entirely in the hands of the Republicans who appear to be prepared to resist any landing of Provisional Government troops in that neighbourhood. Two London, and North-Western Railway Company steamers have been chartered by the Provisional Government during the week ; these vessels were loaded up at North Wall with coal, bales of uniforms, one 18-pr. and one Rolls-Royce armoured car, and sailed on night of 22nd/23rd July for an unknown destination, probably south.From an account received from a reliable source, the state of Co. Mayo and Galway appear to be as follows : the whole area is in the hands of the Republicans, who are unpopular with the country people, the latter being thoroughly sick of the state of affairs.All supplies for the Republican forces are commandeered and a receipt given, unless a bank has been recently robbed, when the tradesman is paid in cash. Although food, as a whole, is still plentiful, bread is scarce, as the &quot; pig boats,&quot; which fomrerly brought flour and yeast from Glasgow and returned with pigs, have now been stopped by the Provisional Government. There are no railways, telegraphs or telephones and, consequently, no newspapers. Practically all private motor cars and bicycles have been commandeered. Thomas Maguire, leader of the Republicans in the Baliinrobe area, is apparently not an extremist ; he rules his area justly, and stops profiteering by the shopkeepers.A party of Provisional Government troops is reported to have been ambushed on 11th July, between Raphoe and Letterkenny (Co. Donegal). Two of the Provisional Government troops were killed and two captured.Of the four 80-foot motor boats recently handed over to the Provisional Government by the Admiralty, one has arrived at Kingstown. This boat is flying what appears to be the Free State naval ensign.The armoured car captured by the Republicans, at the ambush near Sligo, is now reported to be one of the Rolls-Royce armoured cars recently handed over to the Provisional Government.An 18-pr. gun, which went out of action after firing four rounds at the Republicans in Inch Fort (Co. Donegal) on 15th July, was inspected, by request, by an officer of the Royal Garrison Artillery from Fort Dunree. This officer found the gun to be in a very bad condition, rusty and with no oil in the buffers.A statement snowing quantities of ammunition and explosives issued, at request of Provisional Government, is attached.    (Appendix A.)The increase is accounted for by the fact that few issues have been made in the previous fortnight, owing to the dislocation of the railways.The casual and unpunctual methods of the Provisional Government officials, in demanding and drawing stores, give much unnecessary trouble to our storekeepers. The attention of the Provisional Government has been drawn to this through Mr. Cope.Northern Ireland.Belfast and the Six Counties have remained quiet. Police activity is still maintained at a high pitch, and numerous raids and searches have been carried out in Belfast and the country districts. Although no fresh important documents have been discovered, finds of arms, ammunition, explosives, &amp;c, continue.Conclusions.. The following is believed to be the explanation of the mild nature of the fighting in Southern Ireland and the small casualty list.The policy of the Provisional Government is to allow the Republicans to make -themselves unpopular with the people, or to become a general laughing stock ; the authorities do not want to make martyrs of the rebels by inflicting a large number ot casualties on them, or by dealing ruthlessly with their opponents. The unpopularity is already present, and the more the rebels loot, commandeer, and destroy property and communications, the greater this unpopularity will become.The Provisional Government would prefer the casualties to be amongst their own troops rather than amongst the Republicans as, thereby, the sympathy of the people would remain with the Provisional Government troops.

It is these tame surrenders, generally without a casualty, which it is hoped will make the Republicans a laughing stock.This policy, which is typically Irish, is probably the most sensible one under present conditions.At the same time the Free State higher command quite realizes that its own troops are very green and inexperienced ; that therefore direct assaults, with the possibility of severe casualties, art; to be avoided, and that as far as possible indirect methods of capture and the use of smoke screens, &amp;c, are preferable.Whether the above policy will be effectual in stamping out arson and murder, when the Republicans in the field are dispersed, remains to be seen.At present, although formed bodies of Republicans have either been captured or dispersed within the eastern and central counties of Southern Ireland, there still remain parties of armed ruffians who- periodically collect to interfere with railways and communications and to hold up civilians, or to loot and destroy property, even in the suburbs of Dublin.C. F. N. MACR.EADY, General,Commanding-in - Chief, Ireland.General Headquarters, Ireland.25th July, 1922.
