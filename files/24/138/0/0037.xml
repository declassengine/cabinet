[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed&apos;for the Cabinet.   July 1922.SECRET.CP. 4137.CABINET.Proposed Legislation in India to amend the Criminal Procedure affectingthe Trial of Europeans.I have to invite the attention of my colleagues to a matter of great importance, involving considerable changes in the law of criminal procedure, and incidentally affecting the privileges of the European population of India in the matter of criminal trials.The Government of India wish to legislate, during the next session of their legislature (which covers the month of September), with a view to minimising the distinctions which at present exist in the Indian law relating to the procedure applicable to the trial of Europeans and Indians, respectively, on criminal charges. The basis of the proposed legislation is the report (not yet published) of a Committee set up in December last, the recommendations contained in which the Government of India wish to accept without modification.2. Stated as briefly as possible, the history of the matter is as follows. The Indian law of procedure in criminal matters has from the earliest times, and for reasons which are closely connected with the history of the foundation and develop-ment of British supremacy in India, drawn a clear distinction between European British subjects and Indians, and has accorded to the former a number of special privileges. An attempt was made by Lord Ripon&apos;s Government in 1883 to remove these distinctions, but the proposals which were embodied in the famous &quot; Ilbert Bill &quot;&apos; of that year aroused so much opposition on the part of Europeans that the Bill had to be drastically revised. The existing law is the result of the compromise then arrived at a compromise which has never been acceptable to Indian opinion. The complaint which has been persistently pressed and which is repeated with increasing vehemence as the result of nearly every trial in which an European is accused of an offence is twofold; firstly, that racial distinctions, if ever defensible, are entirely indefensible in a matter of this kind, and, secondly, that the result of the existing law is that an European accused of a criminal offence is seldom treated in the manner that justice demands.On the 30th May, 1921, the Viceroy (very shortly after his arrival in India), in the course of a public speech, alluded to the question of racial equality in general terms, and stated his belief that there were &quot; certain questions .... in which there will be an opportunity for putting this equality on a firmer basis than at present exists.&quot; In a later speech (the 3rd September, 1921), with which he opened the first Session of the Indian Legislature to be held since his arrival, he was more specific, and said that his attention had been drawn to the differences in the legal procedure applicable to Europeans and Indians, that an opportunity would be taken in the course of that Session to lay before the legislature the proposals for his Government as to the steps to be taken for further examination of the question, and that he trusted that measures would be found to satisfy public opinion that justice will be done to both Europeans and Indians.It was to be expected that the creation of the new Councils would be seized without delay as the opportunity of pressing this matter to an issue, and in September 1921 a resolution was moved and carried without a division in the Legislative Assembly in the following terms : &quot; That in order to remove all racial distinctions between Indians and Europeans in the matter of their trial and punishment for offences, a Committee be appointed to consider what amendments should be made in those provisions in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, which differentiate between Indians and European British subjects, Americans and. Europeans who are not British subjects, in criminal trials and proceedings, and to report on the best methods of giving effect to their proposals.&quot;3. Anticipating that a motion in the Assembly in some such terms was inevitable, the Government of India had consulted all provincial governments on the5613   100   7/22   [B698] h
question in the previous July (1921), and had asked for their views in time to enable them to deal with the debate. The first official intimation which the India Office received of the discussion was the receipt of a copy of this circular letter in August 1921. In view of the extremely difficult and controversial character of the issues involved, my predecessor, on receipt of this circular, telegraphed on the 1st September to the Government of India asking to be furnished with their views as soon as possible after they had received the local Governments&apos; opinions.4. Meanwhile, in replying to the debate of September 1921, the Home Member of the Government of India, speaking on behalf of the Government, stated that the Government of India had accepted the principle that it was &quot; desirable that there &apos; should be equality of status in this country in the matter of criminal trials,&quot; and undertook to appoint a Committee to make recommendations to that end an under-taking which was fulfilled by the official announcement issued in December last appointing the Committee, in which the declaration was repeated that &quot;the Governor-General in Council has already accepted the principle that it is desirable that there should be equality of status for all people in this country, in the matter of criminal trials and proceedings.&quot; The Committee, which consisted of sixteen members, of whom seven were Europeans, was partly official and partly non-official in composition. It sat in Delhi in January last to take evidence, and later in Calcutta to confer with representatives of the European community. Their report was agreed upon in June, but, as already stated, has not yet been published.5. It is difficult to set out succinctly either the main provisions of the existing law or the recommendations of the Committee for its modification. In both cases details of considerable intricacy are the essence of the matter, and general statements are apt to be misleading unless qualified in detail.I have prepared an exhaustive and detailed statement of this character, and which I propose to circulate to the members of the Committee of which I desire to suggest the appointment in order to deal with this important matter.The general effect of the Committee&apos;s proposals is (a) to &quot; level down &quot; in certain respects the existing rights of European British subjects and to restrict the classes of persons covered at present by that expression;(Jy) to &quot; level up &quot;in certain respects the existing rights of Indians;(c) to provide a special procedure, not as at present for a special class of persons, but for a special class of cases, viz., those in which &quot; racial considera-tions &quot; are held to be involved. How precisely this class of case is to be defined the Committee have not recommended, beyond stating that the definition shall require all cases in .which one party is an Indian and the other a European to be so treated.The main methods by which these processes are to be achieved may be summarised as follows : (i.) Under the existing law practically no serious criminal charge against a European British subject, as defined in the Code,* and no case whatever against a European involving the possibility of a death sentence, can be tried by any Court other than the High Courts of Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, Allahabad and Lahore, and the Chief Court of Lower Burma.Under the law as proposed to be amended a large number of Courts (known as Sessions Courts) which are inferior to High Courts, and of which there is one in each District of a Province, will have the same jurisdiction over both Europeans and Indians in all cases ordinarily triable by them.(ii.) Under the existing law no magistrate (other than a District Magis-trate or a Presidency Magistrate) has jurisdiction to try Europeans unless he has first-class powers and is himself a European.Under the proposals any first-class magistrate, whether he is an Indian or a European, will have jurisdiction to try Europeans.(hi.) Not only are the number of offences triable by Courts inferior to a High Court outside the Presidency Towns more limited if the accused is a European than if he is an Indian, but the degree of punishment which can be inflicted by any such Court is now much more limited if the convicted person is a European than if he is an Indian.It is proposed that the same powers of punishment shall be exercisable whether the convicted person is an Indian or a European.* The word &quot;European&quot; is used in this sense throughout this paragraph unless otherwise stated.

It is difficult to set out succinctly either the main provisions of the existing law or the recommendations of the Committee for its modification. In both cases details of considerable intricacy are the essence of the matter, and general statements are apt to be misleading unless qualified in detail.I have prepared an exhaustive and detailed statement of this character, and which I propose to circulate to the members of the Committee of which I desire to suggest the appointment in order to deal with this important matter. The general effect of the Committee&apos;s proposals is (a) to &quot; level down &quot; in certain respects the existing rights of European British subjects and to restrict the classes of persons covered at present by that expression;(b) to &quot; level up &quot; in certain respects the existing rights of Indians;(c) to provide a special procedure, not as at present for a special class of persons, but for a special class of cases, viz., those in which &quot; racial considera-tions &quot; are held to be involved. How precisely this class of case is to be defined the Committee have not recommended, beyond stating that the definition shall require all cases in which one party is an Indian and the other a European to be so treated.The main methods by which these processes are to be achieved may be summarised as follows :  (i.) Under the existing law 23ractically no serious criminal charge against a European British&apos; subject, as defined in the Code * and no case whatever against a European involving the possibility of a. death sentence, can be tried by any Court other than the High Courts of Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, Allahabad and Lahore, and the Chief Court of Lower Burma.Under the law as proposed to be amended a large number of Courts (known as Sessions Courts) which are inferior to High Courts, and of which there is one in each District of a Province, will have the same jurisdiction over both Europeans and Indians in all cases ordinarily triable by them.(ii.) Under the existing law no magistrate (other than a District Magis-trate or a Presidency Magistrate) has jurisdiction to try Europeans unless he has first-class powers and is himself a European.Under the proposals any first-class magistrate, whether he is an Indian or a European, will have jurisdiction to try Europeans.(iii.) Not only are the number of offences triable by Courts inferior to a High Court outside the Presidency Towns more limited if the accused is a European than if he is an Indian, but the degree of punishment which can be inflicted by any such Court is now much more limited if the convicted person is a European than if he is an Indian.It is proposed that the same powers of punishment shall be exercisable whether the convicted person is an Indian or a European.* The word &apos;&apos;European&quot; is used in this sense throughout this paragraph unless otherwise stated.
(iv.) While an Indian can be tried by jury in a Sessions Court only for a limited number of offences, a European can claim, trial by a jury of which not less than half are Europeans for any offence; and this right is exerciseable by a European even in a Magistrate^ Court.It is now proposed that in both classes of Courts both Europeans and Indians shall be subject to the law at present applicable to the latter in the matter of the right to trial by jury, except in cases where &quot; racial considera-tions &quot; are involved. For these cases the right of both races to be tried by a jury containing a majority of their own countrymen is to be affirmed.(v.) Under the existing law no appeal lies against a.conviction in a trial by jury, except on a matter of law. The Government can, however, appeal against an acquittal on all or any of the charges framed by any Court except a High Court, both on facts and law, unless the trial was by jury, in which case an appeal against acquittal lies on a point of law only.It is now proposed to allow appeals against both convictions and acquittals and on both facts and law in all cases other than those tried by jury. And even in. jury cases it is proposed to allow appeals against convic-tion and acquittal on matters of fact as well as law if the jury was not unanimous, or if, being unanimous, the judge did not agree with them.It will be observed&apos; that this proposal, in its application to jury cases, practically abolishes the principle of the finality of a jury&apos;s verdict. The Committee observe as follows :  &quot; We recognise that this is an important alteration in the general law of the land, but we believe that it will receive considerable support from legal opinion in India. It has been pointed out to us that the English Act of 1907 does not recognise appeals against acquittals. But appeals against acquittals by the Local Government form an integral part of the Indian law and it would not be logical to extend appeals on facts to certain jury cases only in respect of convictions and not in respect of acquittals, especially as the chief complaint made against most juries is that they are too prone to acquit.&quot;(vi.) Under the existing law a European British subject for these purposes is defined as including persons born or domiciled in the Dominions and Colonies.It is proposed to confine the term to persons born or domiciled in the United Kingdom including Ireland, and to place &quot;colonials&quot; (other than those who are members of the British or Indian armies) on precisely the same footing as Indians.The &quot; colonials &quot; in India are believed to be few in number.(vii.) Under the existing law Europeans who are not British subjects, and Americans, though they have no special privileges as regards jurisdiction and powers of Courts, can. when triable by jury, claim a jury containing not less than one-half of Europeans or Americans. It is proposed to abolish this privilege.6. With the items in this summary numbered (vi) and (vii) the Colonial Office and the Foreign Office are respectively concerned. The War Office and the Air Ministry are concerned with the proposals as a whole, partly because so large a number of the persons potentially affected are men serving in the Forces, partly because the pro-posals in their effect upon the Army might conceivably affect security, and partly because the proposals affect that provision (S. 41) in the Army Act which gives a right of trial by Court-Martial to soldiers accused of certain offences which would ordinarily be triable by the Civil Courts, if there is no Civil Court competent to try them within a distance of- 100 miles.&apos; Under these proposals there will be a &quot;competent court &quot; in every district of British India.7. The Viceroy personally and. his Government press most strongly for permission to legislate in September on the grounds set out in the telegrams attached herewith.8. In view of the urgency and complexity of the matter, I suggest for con-sideration that a Committee of the Cabinet, with representatives of the various Departments whose interests are concerned, should be appointed to examine the Government of India&apos;s proposals and report on them to the Cabinet. I should like also to suggest that it would be of great assistance if the Lord Chancellor could join the Committee. &apos;PEEL.31st July, 1922.[8698]
ENCLOSURES.Telegram from Government of India, Home Department, to Secretary of State forIndia, dated July 7, 1922.Reference to Home Department letter No. 104, of 8th June : Racial Distinctions Committee.1. Copies of final report were forwarded with Home Department letter No. 43 of 22nd June, and printed copies were forwarded by mail of 29th June. Not necessary, therefore, to summarise proposals in final report. We note, however, that proposals in draft report were sufficiently modified as to enable Government Members to sign without general saving clause, and where report recommends immediate action, subject only to opinions of Local Governments regarding proposed extensions of rights of appeal in magistrates and jury cases; vide tentative decisions in our telegram. The subject bristles with difficulties, and we are of opinion that it is a matter for congratulation that, in a question where interests of two communities involved were so conflicting, Committee were able to reach conclusions so closely approximating to unanimity.2. Copy of Mr. Carey&apos;s (representing European community) minute of dissent received by post includes, besides minor verbal change not affecting substance, following sentence, after words, &quot;goal of constitutional independence,&quot; &quot;the only objection which can arise to the transfer of summons cases to sessions courts is in the case of parties of insufficient means to pay for this transfer, and in these instances I would suggest Government should undertake the expense of the prosecution.&quot;Advocate-General of Bengal has signed report subject to general agreement with Mr. Carey&apos;&quot; s minute.Colonel Gidney&apos;s minute is as follows : &quot;-As representative of the Anglo-Indian and domiciled European community, I have approached the problem with the same objects in view as Mr. Carey, and the proposals in his minute have my support and endorsement. *&apos;Mr. Sultan Ahmed is signing report, and it is hoped Milner Gour will also do so.Mr. Justice Shah, whose opinion will probably carry great weight amongst the Indian community, may perhaps also sign report^ and add an explanatory minute. Intimation will be sent you as to final action taken by these three last-mentioned members.On settlement of these points, alteration of report and minutes, with exclusion from Mr. Rangachariar&apos;s minute of portions where documents communicated confidentially are cited, will be finally struck off ready for publication.3. Reference to proposals (a) to reduce the offences for which sentences of whipping may be imposed, and to provide that law in this respect shall apply to Europeans and Indians alike, and (b) to repeal Sections 30 and 34 of Code, Committee do not recommend immediate action, but enquiry. We are making separate references to Local Governments on these proposals and proposal in Mr. Carey&apos;s minute, that accused persons should have right to give evidence on oath. Meantime, we propose to retain law in these respects unaltered.4. As  regards  remaining  proposals,  we  are  making  general  confidential reference to the Local Governments and High Courts, in order to secure their opinions in time for early legislation.   We are inviting their opinions particularly&apos; upon proposals to increase right of appeal in magistrates and jury cases, as they increase judicial work.As regards these proposals, we note following points for your information :-(a.) Definition of European British Subject. Committee finally propose inclusion of persons specified in that Clause who are actually serving in India in His Majesty&apos;s British Army, Navy or Air Forces. As regards His Majesty&apos;s Indian Army, Royal Indian Marine or Indian Air Force, they only propose addition of such persons who were so serving at date of the adoption of the proposal. We note that the present definition contains serious anomalies; for example : European British subject domiciled in colony of the Cape of Good Hope is included, but not such a subject domiciled in East Africa. We consider it would clearly be impossible now to ask for any extension of the categories to which the proposed remaining privileges will extend. We recognise that the proposal wall raise the Imperial question, but we do not think that it is of any great practical importance.   No &apos;&apos; colonials,&quot; to use
compendious term, resident in India, have come forward to indicate that they have any apprehensions on the subject. They are largely, we think, resident in the Presidency towns, where the procedure will be unaffected by the proposals. As regards Colonial Members of the Indian Forces, it will be seen that those already in the Forces will continue to be entitled to the existing privileges, and we understand that Indian opinion on the Committee was against providing careers in the Indian-Forces for Colonials in the future. In these circumstances, we propose, for the present, to accept the proposals of the Committee.(b.) Jury Trials. The ultimate compromise proposed by the Committee was the extension for Indians of jury trials in all cases in which racial considerations are involved, and the reduction of jury trials for Europeans in cases in which racial considerations are not involved. That is, in the latter cases Europeans will be tried by mixed juries or with the aid of assessors, according to the requirements for the district and for the class of offence concerned. Indians are triable by jury or with the aid of assessors. For both Indians and Europeans in cases tried with assessors, it is proposed, if accused so claims, all assessors shall be of nationality of accused, and number of assessors shall be a minimum of 3 and, if possible, 4. As regards this compromise, we note that, so far as Europeans are concerned, the number of cases between Europeans is small, and we consider that the judge in the original trial, and the court of appeal, will necessarily attach great weight to the opinion of the assessors. We are of opinion that the compromise is suitable, and we propose to accept it.(*o.) Summons Cases outside Presidency Towns. Proposal finally accepted by Committee was that referred to in paragraph 5 (J) of letter dated 8th June. This is the main point in minute of dissent of Mr. Carey, who suggests that in such cases where racial considerations are involved, and punishment may embrace imprisonment or fine of over 50 rupees, same procedure should be adopted as in warrant cases. The objections in the minute to this proposal are not unreasonably expressed, but we are not greatly impressed by it. We do not consider European Home Establishment can raise any great objection to proposal, and we propose to accept it.(d.) Privileges of Ettropeans who are not British Subjects and Americans.  The Committee finally propose to repeal Sections 460 and 461 of the Code. These privileges are already very limited, as such persons are tried by jury or with aid of assessors, according to the law applicable to the district and the class of offence con-cerned, and accused persons are only able to t:]aim, if practicable, not less than half the number of jurors or assessors shall be Europeans or Americans. We note that such persons had an absolute right to jury trial under Section 234 of Code of 1872, and the jury had to consist of at least one-half Europeans or Americans, if such a jury could be obtained. This right was reduced to the present restricted right by Section 460 of the Code of 1882. We are of opinion that it may be claimed that, whereas formerly such persons might perhaps have been apprehensive as to justice which they would receive from judges and magistrates in Indian Courts, there is now less reason for such apprehensions, as Indian judges and magistrates have established their reputation. The provision cannot be retained, owing to the impossibility of justifying differentiation between these persons and nationals of other countries We suggest you should invite the attention of the Foreign Office to the proposal, but we propose provisionally to accept it.5. We desire to impress upon you the importance which we attach to the desirability of proceeding with the necessary legislation to give effect to the proposals with the utmost expedition. The Ilbert compromise of 1884 was always subject to opposition by Indians, and now that practically unanimous proposals have been made by a strong committee representing all classes, we think it of utmost importance to endeavour to enact the proposals forthwith. The Honourable Law and Home Members have been Members of the-Committee, and we therefore also think it most desirable that the legislation should be carried into effect before they leave the Government. We therefore propose to endeavour to pass the required legislation during September meeting of the Legislature, subject to the opinions received from Local Governments. We are accordingly arranging for immediate preparation of Draft Bill dealing with proposals, except those in paragraph 3 above. With reference to orders in your predecessor&apos;s telegram No. 306, dated the 27th February, 1920, we ask for your permission to publish the report when it is finally printed. Preference paragraph 2 above, the copies of the evidence taken by the Committee were supplied to you with the Home Department letter of the 13th April, and we
trust, with the further papers now supplied, you will be able to give your permission for publication on very early date.6. The following proposals of the Committee require your specific approval in Council before, they can be carried into effect under Section 65 (3) of the Government of India Act: (a) The change in the definition of European British subjects in so far as it affects subjects of His Majesty born in countries in Europe other than the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the children of such subjects.(b) The extension of the definition of the High Court so as to include, withreference to proceedings against such European British subjects as are specified in Section 65 (3), the Courts of the Judicial Commissioners of the Central Provinces, Oudh, Sind and Upper Burma.(c) The proposal to empower judges in Sessions Courts to pass sentences of death on European British subjects.As regards (c), we invite a reference to the remarks in paragraph 5 (g) of the letter of the 8th June. We should be glad to receive your approval in Council to these proposals, which will be included in the draft Bill which it is proposed to introduce in the Indian Legislature.7: Mr. Carey&apos;s minute assumes there will still be special enquiry regarding extension of jurv trials. We think it unnecessary now to come to any conclusion on this point.Telegram from Government of India, Home Department, to Secretary of Statefor India, dated July 25, 1922.Your telegram No. 2778, dated 19th July : Racial Distinctions Committee.1. Confidential reference to Local Governments has issued, and we hope to receive their replies in time to enable Bill, to give effect to our provisional conclusions, to be introduced in Indian Legislature at an early sitting in September, and carried through the necessary stages in that month. We desire, however, with reference to your request that replies of Local Governments should be sent by mail, to state that if, after so sending these replies, we are to wait until you have considered them before receiving your approval to our recommendations, it will be impossible to intro-duce, much less to pass, the legislation in September, which is a matter to which we attach very great importance. We recognise that, if the replies of majority of the Local Governments indicate serious divergence from those proposals of the Committee which we have provisionally accepted, further consideration of our attitude will be required. On the other hand, however, if the replies of Local Governments, as we think is not improbable, indicate that they are all agreed that the present opportunity for settling this controversial question should not be lost, and that provisional conclu-sions should, in the main, be accepted, we consider it would be most unfortunate if we were compelled to postpone legislation. We recognise that, in view of past history of the question, perhaps the proposals may be discussed in Parliament. We submit, however, that, if a strong representative Committee, composed of members of the communities principally interested, has been able to come to almost unanimous conclu-sions upon the question, if these conclusions are supported, or even are not opposed by Local Governments in. India, and if they are, as is the case, after full considera-tion of what they may involve, accepted by us, then there should be no doubt that the recommendations should be carried into effect. We trust, therefore, that you will agree to our telegraphing the substance of the conclusions of the Local Governments for your information, and that you will not require that the introduction of the Bill should be deferred, or await the receipt of their replies by mail, before sanctioning the introduction of a measure.2. In your telegram you refer to the expense involved by the proposals.   This will in fact be confined to that involved by (a) The increase in numbers of appeals from Magistrates and in Jury cases.(b) The somewhat greater elaboration which will be required in summaryproceedings, because appeals will be admissible where they are not allowed at present, vide Section 264 of Code, and(c) The extra cost of the proceedings in cases in which racial considerations are involved.
We do not wish to minimise this point, but we believe that the increase in expenditure will not be great. Under the head (a) the additional appeals which will affect first-class Magistrates only will probably not be great or involve much labour. As regards Jury cases, the present proposals of the Committee only involve a very slight increase in the number of cases tried by Jury. It is true, however, that, so far as High Courts having original criminal jurisdiction are concerned, there will be an appreciable increase in the number of appeals. But this concerns only four Local Governments, Madras, Bombay, Bengal and Burma, and the increase in cost of allowing appeals on questions of fact in Jury trials must be accepted, at least, for racial cases, as accusations of failures of justice owing to acquittals of Europeans by Jury are gravamen of charge against present system. Under the head (b), the increase in judicial labour will be so small as almost certainly to involve but little increase in expenditure. Under the head (c) also, we anticipate that the number of cases in which racial considerations will&quot; be held to arise will be so small as to mean that the increase of expenditure under this head also will be inappreciable. We have particularly directed the attention of the Local Governments to the question of increased expenditure, and we have also directed the examination of statistics for selected areas, so as to indicate the number of cases in which racial considerations are likely to be held to be involved. We expect, therefore, to be able to give you by telegraph more accurate information as to whether probable increase of cost is likely to be appreciable or not, when the replies from Local Governments are received.3. We have stated already that we attach the utmost importance to the passing of the required legislation in September, and we believe that the best European and Indian opinion desire to see the question settled at the earliest opportunity. Further, we consider the possibilities of passing legislation will be seriously prejudiced if it is not then taken up. Our programme of Legislative meetings after September is as follows  (1.) Adjourned meetings, one month in Delhi beginning mid-November. (2.) Budget meetings, one and a half months beginning mid-February.With November meetings, we cannot secure attendance of Legislature before mid-February. November meetings will be largely taken up in completing pending legislation. This will include such heavy work as completion of main Code of Criminal Procedure Amendment Bill, on which we hope to take the Select Committee&apos;s Report through Legislature as far as possible in September, and Work-men&apos;s Compensation Bill, which will be introduced in September, as well as numerous small Bills.In February-March little beyond Finance Bill can be undertaken. After March, we doubt possibility of beginning any Session in Simla next year before general election for new Assembly and new Provincial Councils, as it is most important that Members should then be educating electorates. Thus September meetings are there-fore almost only chance of getting legislation through. We believe also that you will agree that our difficulties will be much enhanced, when the official Members of the Government on the Committee have retired from the Government. Sir William Vincent will retire immediately after the conclusion of the September meetings of the Legislature, and Dr. Sapru will probably want to retire at end of the year. They have taken the leading part in the deliberations of the Committee since its first constitution, and they are fully aware of the reasons which have caused the Committee to come to its final conclusions. It is due to Sir William Vincent&apos;s influence with Europeans, and Sapru&apos;s with Indians, that the substantial agreement has been reached. I cannot nryself exaggerate the importance to be attached to the conduct of the Bill by both of them, for this influence is not confined to their own respective countrymen It is recognised that they have both laboured with single purpose of arriving at the settlement of this question, which hitherto has baffled agreement. Any successors to them will, therefore, be at very considerable disadvantage in securing acceptance of the proposals, but [sic ? of] our Legislature. So far as Parliament is concerned, we think it should be conclusive that the European Com-munity in India, represented in this respect by the Eurooean Association, is favourable to the acceptance of the recommendations, and anxious that this opportunity for settlement should not be lost.4. In conclusion, we note that it has not been an easy matter to reach practically unanimous conclusions upon this difficult question, and any delay now will, as we have indicated, seriously endanger the prospect of settling once for all this difficult question.   It must be remembered that notices of motions for introduction of Bills to
deal with the question have been received from non-official Members. If there is any delay in the introduction of Government proposals, it will be impossible for us to prevent the Legislature from proceeding with non-official Bills to remove racial distinctions from Code of Criminal Procedure, and such Bills will certainly not be so favourable to the European community as the recommendations of the Committee.We recognise your Lordship must have time for consideration of the question, and we have therefore kept you cm fait, with developments in proceedings of the Committee as they occurred. We trust, however, you will be now able to expedite consideration of our recommendations, and that you will be prepared to sanction the specific recommendations made in our telegram of the 7th instant on an early date. We agree that, if you consider this necessary, your approval may be made subject to the issue of later instructions deferring any final action as to the Bill, if the reports of Local Governments are generally unfavourable to the main principles. But we beg of you most earnestly to accede to this request.
