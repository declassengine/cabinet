United States Tariff on Wool.I agree with the suggestion in the Foreign Office . Memorandum that advantage should be taken of the presence of some of the Dominion Ministers in London to discuss with them the- situation arising out of the present commercial policy of the United States, as indicated in the Tariff and Ship Subsidy Bills.     It will oe necessary, however, first to ask the Dominion Governments to nominate representatives to attend such a discussion, and I propose to do this by telegraph, as soon as the Cabinet has considered the question.     The best time for a meeting will probably be at the end of September or the beginning of October (I.fe* as soon as possible after the close of the Third Assembly of the League of Nations, when the Dominion Ministers and High Commissioners will have returned to London.)In the meantime His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington is being asked, at my request, to take any necessary action as regards keeping the Dominion Governments informed of developments regarding the two Bills.(Intd.)

Telegram from the Governor General of Uew Zealand to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Dated 14-th July. (Received Colonial Office 12,0 Noon, 14th July, 1022),Urgent   Confidential   It has been reported to my Ministers that Government of United States has under consideration question of materially increasing duties on imported wool present proposal being understood to &quot;be that revised duty of 33 cents per lb, on the scoured content shall be imposed.     Hitherto consider-able quantities of Hew Zealand wool have been purchased for shipment to United States of America and my Govern-^ ment view with serious concern possibility of Imposition of so heavy a duty which, will operate very hardly against woralgrowers here and might possibly prevent business with United States as regards medium and coarse wools whioh form a large proportion of the output of the Dominion.     My Ministers fully realise that Government of United States adjust their tariff in accordance with what they consider best interest of their people.      3ut having regard, to manner in which suggested Increased duty will militate against interests of Hew Zealand my Ministers will be grateful provided it is in order to do so if His Majesty&apos;s Government would lodge on behalf of this Dominion a friendly and formal pretest with Government of United States against imposition of proposed duty.JELLICCE,
