THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Or? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,- CABINET -- TRADE UNION ACT (1915) AMENDMENT BILL -MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OP LABOUR.SECRET. (1) This Bill has now passed Committee and hasC .P. been reported.4.134&quot;. ,In its present form it alters the Trade Union Aot, 1913,  (by which trade unions were empowered to establish political funds) In one important particular. Under the principal Act, when a political fund has been established by ballot vote of the members, every member Is held liable for contributions or levies to the political fund unless ho obtains exemption by filling in a prescribed application form of exemption;  there is no power to withhold exemption.Under the Bill, aftor the ballot vote of a majority of members voting has sanctioned the establishment of a political fund, every member who is willing to contribute or to be levied for that fund must express in writing in a presoribod form his willingness, which must be renewed annually.In addition, the Bill prohibits a loan from the General fund of the union to the Political fund of the union or of any other trado union, association or body.The other provisions of the Bill are relatively of minor importance.
(2) I aB8ume that there ie no time during theproaent session for faoilities to be given to the Bill.The Bill may, however, come up for consideration at a later stage and on this account I think my colleagues should be put in possession of my views.(3) In my judgment tho principle of &quot;contracting into&quot;the political fund in place of &quot;contracting out&quot; is not unfair.     But I do not agree with the provision for the annual renewal of willingness to contribute.     Once a raomber has expressed in writing his willingness to contribute, this should stand until, in writing, ho withdraws it. (4) Thoro appears to bo evidence of some support forthe principle of &quot;contracting in&quot; from the rank and file of tho unions, who in some casos have had reason to complain of victimization and intimidation, when they have sought to obtain exemption from contributions to tho political objects of tho union, with somo of which they may not be in sympathy.     It is necessary to point out, however, that the Bill, will not prevent euoh intimidation as may exist, although it may mako it more difficult in certain cases. (5) Further, I do not approve of the prohibition ofa loan from tho General Fund of the union to the Political fund in cor tain, political emergencies,     Subject to the requirements of the audit and the scrutiny of the Registrar-. General, aomo temporary intorohangeablllty at prosent exists between the General and Political funds of most unions. Some unions indeed have had to draw upon their Political funds for assistance in dealing with the unemployment among their members.     provided that adequate security to tho General Fund is given, and provided that the power of the
Ex-eoutive to loan money from the General Fund is defined either by a specific resolution of the union or by a rule of tho union, I think suoh temporary loanB should oontinue to be permitted.(6) These are my comments on the Bill in principle.But the question of proceeding furthor in present circumstance-Btancos with the Bill raises very serious misgivings in my mind.     In the first place the Bill has had the active support of tho chief Unionist organiser who, through the medium of tho Unionist Labour Committee, has created considerable political interest in the Bill.     A suspicion has therefore boen aroueod among Trade Unionists that the Bill has been engineered puroly as a political party measure and does not represent a genuine desire on the part of trade unionists for an alteration in tho existing law, (7) In tho second place tho trade union movement atthe moment is in vory low water.     At the recent Labour Party Conference the Chairman spoke of a decrease in affiliated members of 540,000.     The principal unions, such as the Miners, the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the unskilled workers&apos; Unions, havo depleted their industrial funds almost to extinction as the result of the cumulative offoot of trado depression and disputes. Through force of circumstances tho members are being compelled to accept serious wago reductions without even a show of effoctivo resistance,     a decision to press a measure of this kind in these conditions could easily be,and moat certainly would bo, distorted to appear as an act of persecution.(8) Moreover, in recent months there has been a distinct drift in opinion among the mass of the trade
unions away from fanoiful political objectives to a serious consideration of the economic situation at home and abroad, and a consequent strengthening of the position of the more responsible leaders.     The extremists are, however, not yet Bottled; and they would quote the Bill as further evidence of the lack of impartiality on the part of the Government and they would use It as a means for rallying members (already disturbed by tho wage reductions) to a policy of direct action. (9) It will not in any event be easy to handle theindustrial difficulties of the coming winter, and those that may hereafter be expected when trade shows marked signs of revival.     But, in my judgment, these difficulties will be greatly intensified If the trade unions have reason to believe that, during the interval of depression, tho Government has assisted a movement - which, whatever its justification - owes its inception to, and comes from, party organisation.(Sgd.)
