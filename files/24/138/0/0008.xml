It would he a mistake to disturb now the conclusions of the last Prime ministers Conference which settled very carefully what information should be published.      Government of India1s unauthorised publication of memorandum on treatment of Indians in the Empire has been most embarrassing and similar steps in other oases will militate gravely against usefulness of Conference in the futuree       It should be understood clearly that prime ministers Conference deals with most confidential aspects  of Imperial policy and is not body like old Imperial Conference discussing questions of general importance in the Empire such as patents, naturalisation, eto. Same secrecy should attach to proceedings as to those of Cabinet.     With reference to your telegram paragraph 9 I am doubtful of the wisdom of publishing your message and drawing attention thereby to the matter and evoking charges of secret diplomacy.      It should be assured that there is nothing moro to publish beyond what was agreed last July, Ends.ARTHUR FREDERICK.Paraphrase Telegram from th,a Governor General of the Union of South.
