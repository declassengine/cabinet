d tTHE OCMMOKISTSThe -Communisi; Party of Great Britain has been instructed to send to Berlin detailed reports of its work since the last Mosoow Congress in order that this material may be added to that of other countries in a special number of the International Press Correspondence and serve us a basis of discussion at the Fourth Congress,     The subjects to be covered. are :-&quot;Economic life:    position of the workers, unemployment,economic struggles.Finance, currency.

The   Communist Party, its development,  its influence......       upon the trade unions andits spiritual influence upon the working class.General--political and party-political prospects.&quot;- On August 83rd Albert Inkpin, the secretary of theCommunist Party, sent the following circular regarding theforthcoming annual conference to all branch secretaries:&quot;Thei Annual Party Conference&quot;The National Executive Committee has now definitely arranged for the annual Party Conference to be held in London during the week-end October 7.-8.     The principal business of the Conference will be to receive reports from the National Executive and from the Party Commission appointed in accordance with the decision of the Policy Conference last March to consider ratification of the proposals of the commission for the re-organisat Ion of the Party on the lines of the Theses of the Communist International, and to disor.ss various.matters that go to make up the agenda for the meeting of the Fourth World Congress in November.&quot;The Hall selected for the holding of the Conference, the basis of the branch representation and other detail arrangements for the Conference will be announced latefc on.    In the meantime it is advisable that the branches should take steps to appoint one delegate each and forward the names and addresses of such delegates to the Party headquarters, and also to institute funds for the purpose of defraying such delegate&apos;s expenses..    The names and addresses of the delegates are required by headquarters as early as possible so that the delegates may be supplied with copies of reports, statements and other documents issued in connection with the Conference in ample time for consideration beforehand.&quot;In view of the nature of the subjects to be dealt with by the Conference and the vital importance of its decisions on the future of the Party, the National Executive Committee feels justified in urging upon thebr ranches/
hrtstnohes the-&quot;&quot;ne-cd for exer-xjJjslng^ the utmost care- anddiscretion in &quot;the selection of &quot;their delegates.    The chief point that she-old weigh with tho Branches in choosi^ their delegates should be the experience and knowledge of the comrades in Question and their capacity to malte decisions and grasp the significance of the issues involve The Annual Conference must be representative,  through the personnel of the delegates of the very best that the Party can produceo&quot;Two reports of the Party Commission have already been submitted to the branches a    The    Commission&apos; a final and complete report is new being printed and arrangements will bo made for supplies to be available for the dis-tribution to the general membership of the Party within the next three weeks.    In the meantime the special consideration of the Branches, is requested for the draft Statutes end Rules, which are now enclosed  in their final form and which are open to amendment by the Branches.&quot;In issuing these craft Statutes and Rules for amendment,   I am asked particularly to urge upon the branches the necessity of considering them in relation to the very detailed end thorough exp]a nation of thegoverning principles underlying the new method of Party organisation&apos; as set forth in the commission s second report, which is now in your hands.    The draft Statutes and Rules must be treated as the direct outcome cf the Commission&apos;s report, and the report must be carefully considered in relation to the draft Statutes and Rules before amendments to the latter are formulated.    The new scheme of organisation must be viewed as a whole, and any amendments to the draft Statutes and Rules must therefore be strictly in accordance with the principles underlying the scheme.&quot;All amendments to the draft Statutes and Rules must be sent to me at the Central. Office not later than Saturday, September 9th, and should be clearly anddistinctly written on separate sheets of paper, apart from other comnrun i cat ions to headquarters.&quot;The sub-executive of the Communist Party has given furtherconsideration to the attitude to be adopted in regard to theLabour Party and has sent the following instructions tobranches:&quot;It is the decision of the sub-Executive that our Communist Party branches should now apply In a-positive sense that section of the present constitution of the Party (sub-section 12 of the rule relating to branches) which permits of members of the Communist Party becoming . individual members cf another political party (in this cs the Labour Party) en the instructions of their branches,! sarict:; nned by the Divisional Council and approved by the Executive Com-rittee.    It. iz therefore henceforward the duty cf members cf the    Communist Party to apply for membership cf the inr1 i^io.ua.1 section of their respective Labour Pa,r*&apos;.i?o-  end to inform their Branch Secretaries as seen as this has been d ore *    The Branch Secretaries will then .   in turn,  complice ard submit to the Dl vision c/i. Ccuoc; a list of the names ttd addressee of all branch members f have applied for and been accepted to membership of the individual section of The Local Labour Party.&quot;Suet
&quot;Such-jaoembers will, of course, carry on their activities In the local Labour Party under the general supervision and direction of the Party&quot;s Divisional Council, and the Divisional Council end sub-Executive will acquaint these members, through the channel of ordinary Party machinery, of any special activities they may be required to engage in, and also assist them from time to -time with counsel and advice*    Ho action, however, must be taken by the members, at this preliminary stage, beyond applying for membership Of the individual section of the local Labour Party, without waiting for the instructions . oS   the Divisional Council-or&apos;:the Party Centre.&quot;It is not assumed of course, &quot;that the application of our members for membership of the . ind ividual sections of ;local- labour Parties will secure us all that we shall have lost if the Edinburgh amendments to the labour Party Constitution are rigorously enforced against the Communist Party members acting as delegates to their Trade Union Branches.    But It will, at any rate., assist in keeping an-important point of contact between the Party Branches and. the local Labour Parties which,  in present circumstances 1 it is essential to maintain.&quot;There are indications that this policy is not approved by militant members of the Party, especially in Scotland.The full report of :the &quot;Party Commission is being printed and it is desired that &quot;every member Of the Communist Party shall have a copy for which a nominal charge of 3d&apos;.&apos; will be made:    the &quot;report will contain about 64 pages.It has been ascertained that the details of military knowledge for which members of London branches of the Communist Party have recently been asked, covered&apos;:, period of service in the Army; rank; regiment; stations; Qualifications; whether intimate with machine guns, kills grenades&quot;, rifles, revolvers, high or incendiary explosives.PL  Inkpin and S. fish  have been appointed auditors to the Communist Party.The Executive Committee has decided to continue the payment  3.10.0. per.week to Patrick Bavin,  owing to the &quot;unfortunate, stats of health&quot; in which he returned from Moscow.    The &apos; - -Executive Committee has also agreed to pay divisional organisers  1 each per week expenses, for four weeks, in order to assist them in their &quot;present difficult position&quot;.THE RED INTERNATIONAL OP LABOUR UNIONS,The British Bureau has arranged a series of districtconferences/

I am of opinion, and it seems to find general agreement throughout the labour movement, that something should be said in your Address drawing attention to the fact that no proper relationship exists between ourselves and the Russian Soviet Government. As an agriculturist yourself you must realise the over-whelming difficulties under which the Russian peasantry are labouring^, in that they have not the modern means of tilling the soil In the shape of agricultural implements, artificial fertilisers, etcc, etc.   We are credibly in-formed that the crop this year will be more than suffi-cient to feed the entire Russian population, and there may be hopes of a margin for export.&quot;Russia, as you are doubtless aware, has laboured under enormous difficulties, and once she Is admitted to the comity of nations, and providing she oan obtain credits, there is no reason to prevent her from setting an object lesson to the whole western woria.     Her -   peasantry, who have suffered for an age-long period from land-hunger, now enjoy privileges which are denied to our M -own agricultural workers, including the overwhelming majority of your own membership, and I am sure a oneness ! of outlook must exist between your membership and the enormous population of present day Russia.- &quot;Coates and I are submitting first of all a memo-rand urn dealing with &quot;THE ECONOMIC-IMPORTANCE OF RUSSIA&quot;; (2) a circular which the -&quot;Hands off Russia&quot; Committee has just sent to Trades Councils and labour Parties throughout the length and breadth of the country;    (3) a memorandum respecting the policy of the Japanese in Siberia and giving the situation to date.&quot;We think it is of essential importance for you to make a passing reference to the malevolent policy still-&quot;&apos;-&quot;--..- pursued/ISRI-
