CABINET,kP,^4125... ^    /HOME AffFAIRS COMMITTEE.    .PRBVEflTIOH Oi1 CRUELTY TO MIMALS.1 Memorandum by solicitor General.Proposals for Legislation for two improvements in the Law I relating to Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.(a) To make generally obligatory existing Ministry of Health Slaughterhouse Bye laws (deleting alternative Byelaw 9a),(b) To impose punishment of imprisonment without the option of a fine where cruelty found by Court to be wilful and deliberate.PACTS AS,TO SLAUGHTERING.1    . (Per the following statements I make myself personally responsible).(i) There 16 today a great amount of horrible and avoidable oruelty,(ii) In killing animals the first essential is that they should be properly stunned before they are killed.(iil) This was recommended by the admiralty Committee presided over by the present Lord Lee, as long ago as 1904, and has been uniformly carried out by admiralty butchers since then.    On the 18th of September 19E0 the Ministry of Agriculture issued a leaflet of instructions commending this practice generally, and ordering it wherever it was within their control.i (iv) A captive bolt pistol, of which there are today several effectivevarieties, is the only way of eliminating the danger of human i error, inexperience or negligence.
(v) Cattle are the only animals which today--are- ,n^--rmally-----stuxin.o4-; before killing,    -out the poleaxe is used and its misuse is continually causing cruelty.    Pigs,  calves and sheep are usually bled to death fully conscious,(vi) The Byelaws are enforceable today at the option of a local authority.    Only forty-one such authorities out of a very large number have at present adopted them.    Where they are unadopted there is no legal obligation to stun before killing.(vli) There has been in the past and is still some misguided and quite unfounded opposition amongst the butchers to the use of the humane killer.    There is no justification for it,    The meat is just as good as when the animal is killed by the most barbarous process;    indeed, there is strong ground for thinking that the meat of animals killed in a state of terror is not so good as when the animal has been properly stunned, and not frightened, and some think that terror-killed meat may.be unwholesome.    This viev; seems prima facie reasonable.(viii) The validity and reasonableness of the Iuodel Byelaws was recently established in the Divisional Court in a case from Reading, heard by the Lord Chief Justice and Justices Bailhache and waiter,(ix) The use of the humane killer Is spreading in the country, some three hundred thousand   aartri&amp;ges having been sold in 1981*fx) The other Byelaws are all reasonable and have been found bythe more enlightened looal authorities to work well in practice. On the  Snd of this month uir hichard Linthorne, Town Clerk of Southampton, wrote me:Pear Sir,
&quot;Dear Sir,I have your letter of yesterday&apos;s date and in reply beg to say that I know of no reason whatever why the Modal Slaughterhouse  yelaws should not be made generally obligatory. I may say that the Model Bye laws have been in force here for Bome years and their operation has been found to be nothing but beneficial.I am, Yours etc.(Sgd.) H.H. Linthorne.&quot;The two letters attached, frond the Duchess of Hamilton, (Appendix I. ) in the &quot;Times&quot; of July 17th as to the cruelties that go on, and the other from the Superintendent of the Carlisle Municipal Abattoir for the last 25 years,   (Appendix II) are strong testimony.IROIOSAL.I propose that a -bill be introduced making the Model Bye-laws including 9^. which enforces the humane killer, generally obligatory throughout the United /Cingdom: subject only,.if this be thought necessary, to an exemption of the rights of Jews of slaughter according to the Jewish profession. If this exception be considered necessary the proviso to Clause 3 of the Slaughter of Animals: Bill, 1911, which passed through Committee and Aeport otage in the House of Commons (Bill 335) would serve as a precedent.Byelaw 9s should be abrogated altogether.
PUNISHMENT FOR WILFUL, AMD DELIBERATE CRUELTY *This point is not neoessarily connected with the subject of slaughtering, but it has been no doubt noticed by several members of H.A.C. that the punishments inflicted by magistrates for cases of groos cruelty have often been preposterously lenient.    I attaoh a haphazard selection of instances (Appendix III).    As Law Officer I recognise that the ultimate remedy lies in the education of magistrates, but in the meantime, after long consideration, I believe that a distinct reform may be achieved by legislation.   Magistrates:who are unduly lenient do not intend to commit a breach of their judicial duty, and may be presumed.anxious and able as a rule te adjudicate properly on a pure question of fact as to whether in any given case the act of cruelty was wilful and deliberate.    I propose that where the Court does find on the evidence that the cruelty was wilful and deliberate, the punishment should be imprison-ment without the optiofa of a fine,   just as,  to use a grave illustration, where killing a human being is wilful and deliberate-ate, without legal excuse, the punishment is death and not imprisonment.    He doubt some magistrates may refuse to find in accordance with the evidence.if the defendant is to go to prison , but not, I believe, the majority.    I have discussed the matter with other lawyers and I think there is a reasonable chance of my proving right.(Sgd. ) Leslie Scott.Whitehall Gardens,  S.W., 84th July,  1922.  :
a ? p e o n i.OUK   SLAUGHTER   houses. LISA   for.  humane    MBTHOLS. To tho Editor of&quot;The Times&quot;.Sir,       &quot;The Times&quot; has so often upheld the fight against cruelty that I write now to ask you to make known the appalling state of our slaughterhouses.Moat is eaten by people of every class in this country and if produced from fear-8trtoken, anguished animals is very harmful.     It is known that a mother may poison her baby by the condition produced in her milk tmrough anger or fright. Who can say how much the increase of cancer and other diseases that the medical profession are unable to deal with is due to the large amount of pain-poisoned meat donsumed in this country?I would all your readers could go and stand where I stood last week in what is supposed to be the best slaughter-house in London.     Animals were led in to bo slaughtered on a floor covered with blood, amid the reeking carcases of the freshly slain.     I saw four bullocks killed by the Jewish method.     But it is not only this method which is inhumane. The ordinary method of killing largo animals by the pole-axe must also be condemned from the humane point of view.     For it often happens that a slaughterman, using tho poJ-O-axe,&apos; strikes the bullock several times before It is rendered unconscious.     In the hands of a thoroughly skilled and experienced man the animal may bo brought down with one blow, but skill and experience have to be bought at theexpense/
expense of long- practice and much suffering to unfortunate animals.    - Pigs end calves are..generally hung up alive by their logs,  stuck,  and left to bleed to death.      Sheep are killed by having their throats.out.There is a vast amount of totally unnecessary suffering involved in this old-fashioned method of killing.. I hevc, personally,  seen the humane killer used, and the ddath of the animal has been painless and instantaneous. I saw a horse shot with a humane killer in the same Slaughterhouse, and testify that the movements of this animal were true reflex, i.e., purposeless movements.The whole slaughterhouse system in this country is in need of reform,  both from the humane and sanitary -points of view.     It is stated that a bullet-firing instrument is dangerous.     Such instruments are in use in the slaughterhouses- in many-, other countries, such as Switzerland, Sweden, and oven Germany.     Englishmen ore surely capable of taking the elementary precautions in handling a gun which foreign countries havo adouted with complete success.     If the objection is based on the argu-mettt that&apos; the English slaughterhouse system is more slip-shod, unskilled, and altogether inferior in organization to the Continental system, then I answer that the sooner the system is changed the better for the health and sanitary conditions of the country.Yours faithfully,IflN.

COPY.APPENDIX II.Statements in a letter from the Stiperinterident of Carlisle Municipal Abattoir.&quot;I hrr/o been connecter! with the trade for the past 50 yearssuperintendent.I have been superintendent of Carlisle abattoir for the past 85 years, and 23 of these last years we have had only the humane killers at work on cattle (except for a few weeks during the war when it was impossible to get cartridges),  and whether you look at it from, a butcher&apos;s point of view or any other, the humane instruments are far and away the best.     They do away with all sufferings    The animals bleed freely and there is no danger connected with the use of these instruments,    Carlisle Butchers&apos; Association wrote me some time ago that the members of their Association generally favoured the use of the humane killer.    An ex-president wrote me:    For quickness and safety and perfect bleeding he re corn ends the humane killer,, and he also states that the meat keeps better, owing to the cattle being slaughtered under much.quieter circumstances than when the pole-axe is used, and ends his letter by saying he isould never think of returning to the hammer or polo-axe,I urge you to try to get those instruments used.    I shall not  attempt to harrow your feelings with sights of snfferings I have seen on m&quot;ny occasions when the hammer or pole-axe &amp;ro in use, but ask you in the name of swarms of animals that cannot plead for themselves to do your bit to put an end to all the suffering that follows the old way of Slaughter.&quot;and have had a lar-?.o o?xperience in various parts of parts of England s an abattoirand Scotland, both as butcher myself, and asJOHN DGDUS .City of Carlisle Public Slaughter House, July 4,, 1922.(Prom the&quot;Bath and wilts Chronicle&quot; 15th July, 1922.)
