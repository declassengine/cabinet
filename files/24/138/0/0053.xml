(2iiSECRET.CP. 4153.THE CABINET.REPORT ON THE SITUATION IN IRELAND FOR THE WEEKENDING 29th JULY, 1922.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate the report on the Irish situation by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Ireland, for the week ending 29th July.(a) Dublin.  The situation in Dublin has remained unchanged. There have been a few ambushes of Provisional Government troops in and around Dublin but no serious casualties have been incurred. It is probable that these operations will increase, as there are considerable numbers of young armed Republicans in the city, and such actions further retain a number of troops in Dublin who might otherwise be employed in Munster. Bands of young hooligans have been active raiding private houses and clubs for cars, money, food and drink in the suburban districts.Private Taylor (R.A.S.C.) who was wounded in Kingstown on 11th April died of his wounds on 29th July.The attempt to open &quot; peace &quot; pourparlers between the two parties has failed. This and the postponement of the Parliament may be taken as an indication of the confidence the Provisional Government feels with regard to the situation as a whole.(b) Outside Dublin. The Provisional Government troops have made slight progress on both flanks of their line of advance in Munster.The Republicans, it appears, intend making Cork their centre of resistance. Cars, horses, clothing and supplies are being commandeered by the Republicans in the Cork district.From reports it appears that the Republicans are short of arms and ammunition, though certain quantities of these are being imported by sea ; this seems to point to more careful search being required in British ports by the Customs authorities.Diuung the week-end the cable station at Waterville (Co. Kerry) has been occupied by the Republicans. All outgoing Press messages are being censored under the direction of Erskine Childers.Mr. Harry Boland, T.D. (Republican), has been wounded while being arrested by the Provisional Government troops at Skerries. He is now in hospital in Dublin undergoing an operation. Oscar Traynor, who was one of the Republican leaders in the Four Courts, has been captured by the Provisional Government troops.On 29th July about six shots were fired from the shore at the skiffs of His Majesty&apos;s minesweeper &quot; Badminton,&quot; when these were two cables length from Dromore Castle, Lackeen (Co. Kerry). One drum from a Lewis gun was fired from the minesweeper in reply.-Later the minesweeper herself was fired on by machine guns when off Lackeen Coast Guard station. The ship replied by bombarding the station with 4-inch and 12-pr. guns and fired small arms amongst the trees surrounding the station. The hostile fire was quickly silenced.   One Naval rating was wounded in the arm.L. W.-E.The War office,4th August, 1922.Southern Ireland.
Counties Mayo and Galway (except the districts west of Lough Comb and Mask) are now in the hands of the Provisional Government troops.Wanton destruction of valuable private houses and property by the Republicans continues. The most serious case being the destruction of the Marconi Wireless Station at Clifden, Co. Galway.The Rolls-Royce armoured car which the Republicans captured in an ambush near -Sligo has been recaptured by the Provisional Government troops.Northern Ireland.Belfast and the Six Counties have remained quiet on the whole. Some minor cases of fire being opened from the south side of the border against British posts in the Belleek Pettigo area, and against posts of Special Constabulary in the Monaghan salient area, have been reported.W. MAXWELL SCOTT, Colonel, General Staff,For General, Commanding-in-Chief, Ireland(who saw and approved of the draft of above).General Headquarters, Ireland.1st August, 1922.
