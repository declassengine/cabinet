THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1935.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 207 (35).CABINET.EMPIRE MIGRATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I AM circulating for the information of my colleagues the attached verbatim report of a deputation which I received on the 24th October on the subject of Empire migration. The deputation was the outcome of a conference of repre-sentatives of Local Migration Committees and other voluntary organisations interested in the subject, which was held at Newcastle-upon-Tyne on the 24th and 25th September. It was introduced by the Lord Mayor of Newcastie-upon-Tyne, where a good deal of admirable voluntary work has been done for migration in the past. The deputation stated their- case in a very reasonable manner, and indicated that we should have a strong body of opinion behind us. in any well considered policy of Empire migration and settlement. In my reply, I assured the deputation that the United Kingdom Government attached great importance to the question of migration within the Empire, and welcomed the deputation^ assurances of future support. At the same time, I pointed out that the United Kingdom Government could only take action with the full co-operation of the oversea Governments concerned.J. H. T.November 21, 1935.APPENDIX.Note of a Deputation to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs on theSubject of Empire Migration.COUNCILLOR DALGLIESH : Mr. Thomas, I want to say how glad we are to see you again and to thank you for receiving this Deputation. What I propose to do is to open the proceedings and then to call upon Mr. Schonegevel of the Empire Migration Settlement Group, Mr. Somerville of the Empire Development and Settlement Research Committee and Mr. Westwood of the Industrial Advisory Council, and the three latter speakers will be limited to five minutes each if that is agreeable to you.Mr. THOMAS : I am entirely in youu hands.COUNCILLOR DALGLIESH : Mr. Thomas, Members of the Deputation, and Gentlemen.    At the Newcastle Conference on Empire Migration this Deputation was appointed for the purpose of formally presenting to you, as the [12354]     &apos; &quot; b
Representative of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the four resolutions which were passed, and the supporting &quot;Statement of Case.&quot; These submissions have been embodied in a Report of Proceedings, copies of which have been circulated in advance of this meeting to you and to the Members of the Deputation: May I assume that our presence in this room will serve to complete the formality of presentation and that the advance circulation of the Report will enable us to accept its contents as read ?I am glad that procedure has been found acceptable it has the merit of brevity and I will ensure that my remarks are not lengthened accordingly.We come at a time when the calls upon you are particularly heavy owing to difficulties in international relationships, and the courtesy you extend in receiving this Deputation at such a juncture is highly appreciated, Sir. You also sent a telegraphic message to the Conference, which, together with others, proved an inspiring and stimulating influence. I wish to tender our sincere thanks for this consideration.With those preliminary observations, may we pass direct to the Report, and I propose to offer comments from two angles only : Firstly, on Resolutions 1, 2 and 3, and the &quot; Statement of Case,&quot; and, secondly, on Resolution 4, which deals with the setting up of a Permanent Committee.A conference of 50 delegates is not the ideal place to formulate detailed schemes, but in regard to the &quot; Statement of Case&quot; I would like to explain that it is based on, and substantially coincides with, a carefully considered memorandum previously prepared by the Empire Migration Settlement Group a document which had received considerable publicity prior to the Conference. I desire here only to indicate the origin of the document, and to say that its terms and conditions were fully examined and unanimously endorsed by the Conference.The aim of the Conference was to stimulate thought on migration issues, and in furtherance of that object it is proposed to-morrow to circulate 3,000 copies of the Report of Proceedings. So long as the Dominion Parliaments take the view that migration cannot re-open until their own unemployment problems have been cured, the movement of Britishers abroad will be stifled. Nor is it easy, during a time of widespread unemployment, to take a more detached viewpoint.Very broadly, the first three Resolutions and the Statement urge upon the Government the need for plans which will ensure the commencement of a substantial migration movement and as to the form Community Settlements are advocated.We are aware that no Scheme can operate which does not carry the support of the appropriate Dominion, and different Dominions will doubtless require different Schemes. Some may agree to infiltration of individual families or even only boys, or single women, but our concern here is not the detail of Schemes  that can only be settled by the Governmental Body having full knowledge of the views of the separate Dominions.But I desire to stress the need for a changed financial outlook on migration. I acknowledge that the Government has devoted considerable effort to this problem. So also have the Dominion Governments, but, in spite of years of negotiation, the position reached is one of deadlock. The problem requires a new treatment. Because migration was highly successful without Government -assistance in the pre-war years, it will be so again if conditions become favour-able, is a dangerous argument-an excuse for resting on our oars. In pre-war years, citizens of the United Kingdom, did not have the benefits of the post-war social services. Members of the British Public now enjoy a margin of security in the standard of living, below which they need not fall, and I am thankful for it. But mark my words, they will not migrate in future unless some standard is secured for them abroad. The point I desire to make is that future schemes must be adequately financed and the interests of migrants properly safeguarded. A new statutory basis is required replacing the fifty-fifty principle of the Empire Settlement Act, and giving wider scope to the body responsible for deciding the terms and conditions of future schemes.Now as to Resolution 4. The executive actions arising out of approved schemes are kept under Governmental control through the Overseas Settlement Department and its Central Committee. The machinery for effective action on approved schemes is sound and ready to function.
But there is the other important aspect that of bringing forward new ideas, focussing public attention on them, and offering advice to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment. These are advisory functions, and the Newcastle Conference was concerned with this latter aspect.The number of voluntary organisations interested is considerable, but the advisory work is not adequately co-ordinated.The Standing Committee of the Royal Empire Society has from time to time spoken collectively for the voluntary organisations, and I want to acknowledge the valuable services they have rendered, but I am anxious to see a Co-ordinating Committee under the Chairmanship of the Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs on the lines recommended in the Inter-Departmental Committee Report; that I must leave to you and to the discretion of the Secretary of the Dominions, whoever he may be a Committee sufficiently strong to influence opinion throughout the Empire. There seems no escape from the position that the expenditure of Government money will be essential to the successful prosecution of an effective migration policy, and for that reason I heartily support the view that the Committee Chairman should be the Under-Secretary of State, leaving the Vice-Chairmanship as a non-political appointment.The Newcastle Conference indicated that these voluntary bodies are prepared to meet and to speak with a united voice. In fact, as evidenced by Resolution 4, it was felt that a Permanent Committee should be set up to continue the work started at the Conference.The Resolution further appoints me as Chairman and makes the original headquarters Newcastle Town Hall, and here I ask you carefully to consider what is best. Unlike old soldiers, Lord Mayors die with unfailing regularity, and the Town Hall facilities are not permanently at my personal disposal. Next, it is probable that a Committee to sit in Newcastle, built up in response to invitations issued by myself on the authority of the Conference, would not be likely to attract a sufficiently imposing personnel for the important responsibilities to be shouldered.Further, the headquarters of most of the National Voluntary Organisations are in London. I could suggest a better place, but as Lord Mayor of Newcastle, modesty prevents me from mentioning it.Then a similar Board is contemplated in the Inter-Departmental Committee Report. This is clearly the type of organisation required. The Newcastle Committee would cause overlapping and would be likely to prove less effective.For these reasons I do not propose to implement Resolution 4 beyond recommending that such a Committee should be introduced and to suggest that some form of close liaison might be established in the Northern Counties  particularly in Yorkshire, Durham and Northumberland or that a Committee should be formed in the Midlands, in the Southern Areas and the Welsh Areas. Possibly a Sub-Committee for the Area would prove suitable if brought into being on Governmental advice. The Northern Special or Depressed Area has its headquarters at Newcastle, and in the past the Northern Counties have yielded a good supply of suitable migrants.I will close, therefore, with hoping that you will accept Resolution 4 as conveying the opinion of the Conference that a Central Standing Committee should be appointed, with powers not only to advise upon specific proposals referred by the Secretary of State, but also to bring forward new ideas and to inspire the formulation of new schemes.I will now call upon Mr. Schonegevel.Mr. SCHONEGEVEL : Mr. Thomas and Gentlemen, I am satisfied that five minutes is not necessary for me to say I feel I am preaching to the converted. I think the Government have themselves shown that they favour migration. Where we differ is upon the policy which the Government has pursued in the past. We say we know that the Government are going to support us, and I take that for granted because I understand the intelligent forecast to be that one of the six planks in the Government platform at the coming Election is to be migration. The only trouble is this, that I understand migration takes the sixth place,, whereas I claim it should take the first place.Mr. THOMAS : You must have been looking through the wrong door at the Election.[12354] B 2
Mr. SCH.ONEGEVEL : I have, looked at the papers. Whether that.be: so or not, I am perfectly satisfied that we are going to get the Government to realise in a very tangible way-that there must be an alteration of the 1922 Act.Mr. Thomas and gentlemen, at this Conference at Newcastle there were some fifty delegates, representative of almost every type of party leaning one can imagine, and still I found there the true spirit of Macaulay. There we were all desirous of serving one cause, that is the cause of the State. If we can get that unanimity in a Conference such as that, then I feel certainly there would be unanimous support of the Governments policy should it desire to augment the 1922 Act, and to go forward with a very strenuous and very determined and very vigorous policy of migration. I make bold to say that in this pamphlet which has been issued to you, and I understand a copy of it will go to every Member of Parliament here and in the Dominions, we do not claim that to be all that can be said about migration, but we say that there is the foundation upon which a sound, logical, migration policy can be established, and we will go further and say this, that should the Government do us the honour of asking for our co-operation at any time and in any place there are members of this Committee and members of the delegation able, I know, to spare the time and the energy and the will to help the Government in the troubles which may exist. I realise very fully that there are other difficulties besides that of finance. I realise that finance is a very vital matter, but I realise, too, that since the Great War English people have become homesick. They seem to have been flocking back to the Old Country, and, although the spirit of adventure is still there, and although they still desire, I know, to make good, I must confess that there will be an enormous amount of spadework necessary to bring the people back to the frame of mind when they are prepared to go beyond the shores of their own country.I want to give you this assurance, Mr. Thomas, and I want to give you this assurance on behalf of my Group and on behalf of every member here, that, whilst we are not able to supply the money, we shall create enthusiasm in every shape or form we can, by public speeches and banquets, and in any shape or form possible, and bring pressure on the minds of the people to realise that the spirit of migration must be a very important factor to them.I say, Mr. Thomas, that it is not a question of politics. It is a question of Empire. We, in our Group, have a slogan : &apos;&apos; The Empire spaces for the Empire races.&quot; I believe that to be a slogan which can be well established, and I feel that if you will give us the lead, if you will give us the money, then you will find there will be no difficulty in so far as the Dominions are concerned. Before we had the Statute of Westminster, every Dominion spoke about Australia first, Canada first, South Africa first, and not the Empire first; but since there has been complete autonomy that view has changed, and every member of the Empire now says &quot; the Empire first.&quot; If that be so, whereas before we had complete autonomy every little Dominion had its own little particular plan for the development of its own particular Dominion, I say : &quot; Let every Dominion still have its own plan, but also let it be given an all-embracing plan for the Empire,&quot; and in that Empire plan migration is a very important factor, to be able to settle people from the congested areas in healthy surroundings under good governmental control, and then, by After-care Committees to see to it that those who leave our shores to go abroad will be happy to stay there, and not feel so homesick that they want to come back after they have been there a few months.Mr. SOMERVILLE : Mr. Secretary of State, in the absence of Sir Henry Page Croft, I have been asked to say a word on behalf of his Group of workers, and we know how long and how keenly he has been working for the cause. I might also mention that I speak for one voluntary society, the Church of England Council of Empire Settlement. We are marking time at the present time, in fact I think we are slipping back, and the reason given is that circumstances are -against us, chiefly economic circumstances, but a great Empire with such resources and such reserves of energy ought to have the power to compel circum-stances. We have come&apos;here to-day to ask you to compel circumstances. Hitherto, migration has been on a scrappy, unthought-out system. We want that to be changed. We want Imperial co-operation between this country and the Dominions. Would not the circumstances be changed if this country said : &quot; We are ready to provide a guarantee,&quot; not necessarily capital, but merely a guarantee 1 If the. Government provided the guarantee there would be no difficulty in
providing the money, and the Dominions would provide the opportunities, opportunities not merely of land settlement, but of rail development, air development, shipping development, mineral development and industrial develop-ment of every kind. I put it to you, Mr. Secretary of State, whether, if such a great Imperial plan were projected by this country in connection with the Dominions, the result would not be an outbreak of energy, a revival of enthusiasm unparalleled. There are the voluntary Societies now with their machinery rusty. There are the County Committees, who are ready to take a great hand in the work. If the Government did undertake such a great plan, the result would be that all these agencies would burst into new life and would work together. As for the reasons, the reasons are so obvious that it is not necessary to repeat them. I will just mention one, which is a controlling force at the present time, that is, the interest of world peace. We all know that there is no agent so powerful for the preservation of the peace of the world as a well-peopled and well-developed British Empire, and that is what we ask you to begin to initiate, and, Sir, such an ideal bears the hall-mark of eventual success, because it would lead to practical results which would be of the utmost benefit both to the British race and to humanity.Mr. WESTWOOD : Mr. Thomas and gentlemen, speaking on behalf of the Industrial Advisory Council, I want to say that we associate ourselves with all that has been done by Newcastle and with the work that this Deputation is putting before you to-day. Might I say that it is a non-party question, as you will see from the composition of the Deputation, and migration, as we feel, ought to be a non-party question. We do not want to go back to the time when we had migration in the pre-War years. Then the only thing that was really thoroughly organised was the quotas of migrants who were going abroad by. the shipping companies. We want migration; we want to appeal to suitable migrants to go abroad; but we want not only thoroughly organised finance, but thoroughly organised migration, not only by taking the people from this country to the Colonies, but in not allowing them to fall away when they get to the Colonies, to see that they are looked after when they get there, because the failure of migration in the past has been that when men and their wives and families have gone abroad they have been left at a loose end and left at a dead end. We do not want that. We want migration and we feel that there are many people in the working-class movement of this country to-day who are anxious to get abroad. It is quite true to say there may be some who are anxious to get back, but they are anxious to get back simply because they have not been thoroughly looked after, possibly, when they got there. We want that altered. We want to see that there is an After-care organisation responsible for those people. We want to see that the matter is thoroughly financed and well organised because we feel, that not only do we want to relieve our own unemploy-ment, but we do not want to add to the unemployment in the Colonies. We want to send abroad suitable craftsmen who are going to be an asset to the Colonies and an asset to the Empire. As a matter of fact, we have in this country to-day many craftsmen who cannot find work in this country. We are anxious that those people, if there is an opening for them in the Colonies, should get an opportunity of going to the Colonies and of proving that, where they may have been an asset in the past and possibly just at the moment, because of the acute unemployment position, they have become a burden, we want to see that those craftsmen become an asset to the Colonies to which they migrate. We do hope you will give the matter favourable consideration to see that those who are suitable for migration abroad are given the opportunity to go to the Colonies and the opportunity to settle down and become, not only an asset to their people at home, but an asset to the Colony to which they have migrated and an asset to the Empire in general. We do trust you will give the matter very serious and earnest consideration, not only for the good of those who may be anxious to go abroad, but for the good of the Colonies, to relieve some of the present distress here and to allow the Colonies to benefit by an increased asset.COUNCILLOR DALGLIESH : That is our case.Mr. THOMAS : Gentlemen, any Minister receiving a Deputation of this kind must be impressed by two facts. First, here is a body of representative men who are working and pleading for a cause in which they believe and working lor it without any personal reward.   Therefore, it is not only a delight and
pleasure to me, but I express my thanks to you all ior the great voluntary work and the great Empire work you are out to try and accomplish. Newcastle has every reason to be proud of its past record in this matter. In the early.days the hostels you set up for boys and women were, not only a credit, but everyone with any knowledge of that work would pay tribute to the magnificent self-sacrifice and devotion of the Newcastle people.I want, if I may, to say to you straight away that there is no particular work with which I would prefer my name to be associated in this office than with a real Empire policy which meant the Empire being peopled by our own stock. The importance of that can never, never be over-estimated, for this reason. Take the crisis in which we find ourselves to-day, nothing has given the Government more pride and pleasure, nothing has been such an example to the rest of the world, than the picture of the self-governing Dominions, free and unfettered, with their own Parliaments, approaching all problems, and this problem in particular, in their own way, spontaneously and without reserve, with no solitary exception, standing behind the British Government. There has been no exception at all. Every British Dominion has not only stood behind, but is standing behind the British Government, and, what is more important, they are standing behind the British Government because they are the real believers in peace and because they believe the British Empire can be a real contribution to this very difficult problem. If that be true, you can never measure the tremendous importance of that fact in mere pounds, shillings and pence. I do not think, in approaching the problem of migration, you must look at it exclusively from the standpoint of cost, because the benefits that will accrue and must accrue from peopling the whole Empire with our own stock cannot be measured in a balance sheet of that kind. Therefore, I say straight away that I not only attach importance to the subject, but I welcome your co-operation.In the next place, we must not mix the problem of migration with that of unemployment, and merely let it be assumed that we are looking upon it as a means of solving our own unemployment problem. Nothing is more fatal than to mix it in that way, because it is not only resented in the Dominions but it conveys the entirely false impression that we are merely dumping on to them undesirable or unemployed people. That is not the basis upon which we work, but we would be foolish not to realise what a tremendous factor in our unemploy-ment problem the question of migration is. Prior to 1929 the average number of people leaving these shores in the course of a year was over 100,000; it went up as high as 190,000. Last year there were 15,000 odd more people returning than left these shores, and you have only to examine those figures over a period of years to see the tremendous connection between that and the problem of unemployment. That being so, something else emerges from it. We have no right to ask our people to migrate and take their chance unless we are prepared to give them a fair crack of the whip, and we have no right to ask people to migrate and take their chance unless they are welcome in those Dominions, unless a real welcome is given to them, and the difficulty we are up against at this moment is the large mass of unemployed in each of the Dominions.Only a few months ago I discussed this with every Dominion Premier, because I wanted to avail myself of the opportunity, not only of urging this question, but of getting their reactions. They very naturally said, &apos;&apos; We cannot be unmindful of this fact, that if large masses of your people come and there are large numbers of unemployed in our own towns and our own cities, it is not that they will not get a good welcome, but their presence will be resented, because it will be felt that the people already unemployed should have the first preference.&quot; Of course, the natural answer to that is this, that with the great space, mineral wealth and potentialities of all our Dominions, there ought to be more than room not only for their own people, but a very large number more. Therefore, you must, by the very nature of things, associate this question with the question of the development of the Dominions. That is to say, you have got to say, &quot; Yes, that may be perfectly true and we will not be parties to sending people out either to displace others already there, or not to have a chance when they get there, but equally it ought to be possible with co-operation, with goodwill, and with a big broad outlook to the future to bring about such development that would not affect those people there, but would equally be beneficial to them as well as to us.&quot;I want also to say this to you. The spirit of adventure is not lost entirely in this country.   There is a lot of talk about people being too spoon fed, and that
people will not take risks, but I want to remind you that for the past five years at least there have been over 50,000 people ready and willing to take their chance if they were given the chance to migrate. That shows conclusively that the spirit is there.So far as the Government are concerned, this problem has never been approached merely as a financial problem. I speak for the Government as a whole when I say that if a proper scheme of co-operation, and I mean co-operation with the Dominions as well, if a proper scheme of co-operation can be worked out the Government will be prepared to give every assistance, but you will remember, and I stated it quite clearly in the House over two years ago, I said I thought that while this lull and this economic difficulty was taking place was the time to consider the problem, so that we would be ready and prepared with schemes when the opportune time came, and you know that the present Colonial Secretary, then Under-Secretary of this Department, Mr. Malcolm Macdonald, sat on a committee for months and prepared a magnificent report. Immediately that report was presented to me we arranged to send it to the whole of the Dominions. We have now, I think, received replies from all, and the main broad principles of the scheme are acceptable to most of the Dominions, but again they point out the economic position I have already described to you. One of the most important parts of that scheme and one of its principal recommendations is the one you have referred to, a Co-ordinating Committee. We are working on that now. I think it is a good thing; there are certain details to be worked out, but in the main the principle is good because the more people we can mobilise, the more brains we can avail ourselves of, and the more goodwill we can create, it is all to our advantage.You will be pleased to know that Lord Stanley is taking a particular personal interest in and working very enthusiastically on that point now.I would only say one other thing to you and it is this. I suppose you would all agree with me that one dissatisfied person returning is capable of doing more harm and you hear more about his grievances than about the thousands who are doing well and about whom you never hear, and one of the unfortunate things which arose over the Victoria settlers was the dissatisfaction and the disaffection spread, but we must see to it that the principle is still good. There are certain failures, but there are magnificent successes, as the Empire as a whole proves.Therefore, I will say no more except that I welcome your offer of help, I welcome your co-operation. I am delighted that you are propagating this question in the way you are doing, and, above all, I say to you, do let us remember that if any moral stands out more clearly than any other to-day it is that this old British Empire of which we are all proud is something that we all ought to work for, and that we are going to hand on to those who succeed us.COUNCILLOR DALGLEISH : Do you wish to hear anyone else ?Mr. THOMAS : I think the case has been well stated and I shall see that my colleagues in the Cabinet not only have the Newcastle Resolution, but a full state-ment of what has happened to-day, because a shorthand note has been taken and the whole of my Cabinet colleagues will see that.SIR HENRY FAIRFAX-LUCY : Might I be allowed to ask the Secretary of State if the Lord Mayor of Newcastle or some other representative here could be associated with the Under-Secretary of State&apos;s Committee to which he has referred ?Mr. THOMAS : The Under-Secretary of State is here. A note has been taken of all that has been said and the matter will be discussed with a genuine desire to see what co-operation can exist.COUNCILLOR DALGLEISH : On behalf of this Committee, Mr. Secretary of State, I offer to you our profound thanks for receiving us here to-day and for the very kind way in which you have heard us. We know you have a busy time ahead of you and we tender our best wishes that you may be returned to Parliament, and that you may return to this Department.t(    Mr. THOMAS : Seeing that this is a non-party gathering, I can say Thank you.&quot;(The Deputation withdrew.)
