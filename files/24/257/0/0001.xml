This was. 43,000 more than a. month earlier and 244,000 more than a year ago.An improvement in employment was recorded in coal mining,  iron and steel, general engineering,  shipbuilding and ship-repairing, motor vehicle,  cycle and aircraft
manufacture , the building, furniture, pottery and wool textile industries, cotton preparing,  spinning, etc., and cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery manufacture. There was a further decline in the clothing trades and the linen industry, and there was some falling off in cotton manufacturing (weaving etc.), artificial silk yarn spinning and the distributive trades.   RAILWAY TRAFFIC.    During the five weeks ended 1st September railway traffic receipts increased by £234,000 (1.39%) as compared with the corresponding period of 1934. An increase of 3.5.% in passenger traffic was offset by a decline of 2.8% in coal and other fuel and 0.3% in other merchandise.  The total receipts for the 35 weeks ended lst September amounted to £101.4 m.  against £100.5 m, for the same period of 1934.                                          SHIPPING. The Chamber of Shipping index number for freights (1913 = 100) was 78.25 as against 80.30 in July and 86.62 in August, 1934.                                                    COAL.   The  average weekly output of coal during the thirteen weeks ended 24th August was 3,970,000 tons as compared with 3,881,000 tons in the same quarter of 1934, an increase of 2.3%.  The average number of persons employed during the period was 754,800 as against 766,400 a year before. Exports amounted to 3,451,000 tons as compared with 3,268,500 tons in August,  1934, larger quantities being taken by the Irish Free State, Germany, Denmark, Portugal, Egypt and the Argentine.  There was, however, a decline in shipments to Sweden, Norway, Belgium,  Italy, Algeria and Tunis.                                                                    IRON AND STEEL.    The holiday season has affected new business in the iron and steel markets, but good deliveries
were made to the consuming industries.    There were definite signs of a revival in orders, however,  towards the and of the month.      The demand for pig iron has &quot;been well maintained and business remains steady in the semi-finished steel section.     There was a slight seasonal decline in new business in certain departments of the finished steel market, but on the whole  active conditions preva il.Scotland.    All branches continue to be  active and there have recently been some encouraging shipbuilding orders.    Structural engineers in particular are well employed and re-rollers are taking good orders.    New business for sheets has been somewhat scarce.    The export trade is in general somewhat unsettled.North East Co&quot;st.    Active conditions continue to prevail and a further rise in production is anticipated. S^les are mostly on home account but foreign demand for finished material is increasing.      Structural engineers are busy and there has been an increased demand for special steels.Sheffield.     A high level of activity was maintained by most sections of the trade and is expected to continue. Trade in the heavy steel foundries is improving.    The volume of business in stainless steels is. well maintained and thare has been an increased demand for special steels.South Wales.    There has been an appreciable improvement in business since the holidays.   Makers of structural material have taken a fair volume of orders.    Conditions in the tin plate trade are steady.ENGINEERING.      In August the volume of activity in the industry as affecting the- numbers employed has continued to expand.      Reports as to new business and also as to prospects of future work are generally satisfactory.Exports of machinery in August amounted to  2.94 m. asagainst  2.59m.  in August,  1934.-3-
MOTOR INDUSTRY.      The number of motor cars newly registered in July was 30,268 or 5,766 more than in July 1934, the increa.se comprising .4,541 private cars and 1,225 other vehicles.      The estimated production of motor cars and taxis for the 9 months ended 30th June was 241,100 against 208,600 a year ago,  an increase of 15. Ufi.      Production of commercial motor vehicles for the same period was 70,900 as against 65,300,  an increase of 8.5^.      For the 10 months October,  1934,  to July,   1935, sales of motor cars showed an. increase of 20;o over last year.Although the United Kingdom share in Empire markets in no case reaches the peak figures of 1932-33,   larger proportions of the available tra.de are being secured in certain markets than for some time past, notably in India, New Zealand and Southern Rhodesia.LIGHT METAL INDUSTRIES.      In non-ferrous metals it is anticipated that business will remain brisk for the rest of the year.      The trade in cutlery,  especially in medium and better quality goods, has shown some improvement,      The tool trades,  the lock and allied trades, press work,  the foundry industry and. enamelled hollow-ware all report busy conditions,  and the position in metal smallwares and. the needle and fishing tackle industries is satisfactory.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.      In general,  active conditions continue in the industry.      Good orders for heavy engineering plant continue to be received and the industry has been assisted by orders placed by the Central Electricity Board,  the General Post Office,  the London Passenger Transport Board and contracts from Western Australia.      There is an increasing demand for electrical accessories and a renewed interest in wireless receiving sets.      Exports of electrical goods and apparatus in August amounted to  720,000 as against  621,000 last year.
Imports were valued at  265,000 as against  311,000 in August,  1934.The consumption of electricity during August amounted to 1,189 in.  units,  or an increase of IE.3p over the same month last year.COTTON.      There was the normal seasonal decrease in activity during August.      Average weekly deliveries of raw cotton to spinners were 20,01 m.  lbs. as against 25.58 m. lbs. in July and 19.97 m.  lbs.  in August last year.      In particular, takings of Indian cotton declined.During the month there was an almost continuous fall in the prices of the main types of raw material.      Spinners generally appear to have improved their margins, but the improvement was not equally distributed over all sections.Exports of cotton yarns during August were 11.94 m.  lbs.  as against 11.93 m.  lbs.  in July and 10.13 in. lbs.  in August last year.      As compared with July there was a fall in shipments to India, Holland and Germany, but trade with Scandinavia, Belgium and Eoumania showed some increase.Shipments of cotton piece-goods during the month were 160.6 m.,  sq. yards as compared, with 170.2 m.  sq. yards in July and 168.7 m.  sq. yards in August last year.      As compared with July expox-ts of grey goods,  printed goods,   and coloured goods were all lower, but exports of dyed and bleached goods increased slightly.      As compared with July there was a drop in exports to British West Africa, New Zealand and Canada, but shipments to India,  South Africa,  Ceylon and British Guiana increased. In Europe business with most countries was on a smaller scale, Scandinavia alone of the principal markets telling increased imports.      Shipments to French West and Equatorial Africa declined,  but there was an expansion in exports to Iraq..    In Soul and Central America only Cubs, showed a marked increase.se in imports.
TOOL.    There was an appreciable decline in the general activity of the worsted section of the industry during August as compared with the previous month.      The activity of the woollen section showed little change.      Exports of tops and yarns decreased as compared with July? but exports of tissues showed some increase.      Raw wool prices remained stable.Except in the heavy woollen district, where the recent seasonal improvement in demand is maintained, new business continues te be scarce.SILK AND ARTIFICIAL SILK.      The demand for rayon yarns hile not very brisic has shown some improvement, particularly from the dress and warp Knitting trades.      The demand from the stocking trade,  however, continues to be affected by the low price for real sils.      Considerable sales of rayon piece-goods have been made owing to manufacturers liquidating stocks,  in most cases at a loss.      Generally speaking, September business opened less vigorously than a year ago.The price of raw&apos; silk has increased slightly owing to the difficulty in obtaining Italian raw silk.      The spinning section is fully occupied with yarns for the hosiery trade, but the weaving section continues to be affected by the importation of Japanese silk goods in the grey.HIDES AND LEATHERS.      During August hide prices have shown a general tendency to advance,  due more to the European situation and the increase in commodity prices in America than to any improved demand for leather.Owing to holiday influences there is little change in the leather position,  though, generally speaking, business opened up towards the end of the month rather better than is usual in August.      There is more activity in Winter footwear and in repair work, and there has been more inquiry for heavy sole leather.
i IMCHEMICALS.     Deliveries of alkalies and chlorine products to the home trade during August were below those for July, due possibly to the holiday season, and overseas alkali shipments also fell off.      Home sales of dyestuffs and intermediates showed a satisfactory increase, but export-sales, particularly of alizarine and of rubber chemicals, decreased.     The market for tar products and for wood distillation products was quiet during the month,  although in the case of tar products enquiries increased towards the end.POTTERY.    Activity in the pottery industry continued to be fairly satisfactory during July.    In the general earthenware section an important development has been the formation of a new Association comprising the manufacturers of 90 per cent, of the earthenware consumed in the home market.      The demand for china ware,  glazed wall and hearth tiles, and sanitary ware continues to be good and orders for electrical ware show an improvement over last year.RETAIL TRADE.      The money value of retail sales for July was 6.7 per cent, greater than in July,  1934.      Every area showed . increased sales, both in the food and non-food departments,  the largest increases being recorded by the South of England (8.1 per cent.), London (Central and West End)   (6.6 per cent.), London Suburbs  (6.6 per cent.), North of England  (6.1 per cent.) and Scotland (5.3 per cent.),CO-OPERATIVE TRADE.      The Co-operative Wholesale Society&apos;s sales for the four weeks ended 10th August showed an increase of 21.9 per cent, over a year ago.      The weighted average of the wholesale prices of seven of the principal commodities showed an increase of 6.64 per cent, as compared with last year and the weighted average oi the retail prices of the same commodities increased by 3.55 per cent.
CANADIAN TRADE.     There was a marked expansion in many industries in July and  the index of the physical volume of business was 103.0 as against 99.2 in June.      NicKel and zinc exports and bauxite imports showed considerable increases. Most of the food industries were well occupied.      Newsprint production was maintained,  though there was a decline in the export of timber.      There was an increase in the output of pig iron and steel and the seasonal oecline in the production of motor cars was less than normal.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.      95,300 bales of wool were received into store in July, of which 1,900 bales have been sold or shipped; the corresponding figures for last year were 105,000 and 2,360 bales.      Shipments of wheat and flour for the period let December to 29th August are equivalent to 78.4 m.  bushels of wheat as against 69.5 m. bushels for the same period last year.      Exports of butter for the period 1st July to 17th August amounted to 4,025 tons as compared with 5,363 tons a year ago.      Imports of merchandise in July amounted to  8.1 ai.   (Australian currency) as against  6.8 m.  last year.-SOUTH AFRICAN TRAPS.      The latest available data show no material change in the high level of economic activity,  except perhaps to confirm that a slower rate of progress appears to have set in.      Allowing for seasonal fluctuations the export trade continues in an upward direction.      There has been some decline in the value of imported goods,  due more to seasonal causes than to a change of trend.      Farming prospects are generally good and prices of agricultural products have been fairly steady during the month.      The latest estimate of the maize crop is 17.9 m. bags,  the results of the threshing operations having been disappointing.      The wool clip for 1934-35 amounted to 660,000 bales,  a decrease of 23 per cent,  as compared with the previous season.      This is largely due to heavy losses of sheep in the 1933 drought.
lbINDIAN TRADEc      Imports of merchandise in July amounted to 1,006 lakhs of rupees as against 990 in July,  1934, while exports showed a slight decrease at 1,207 lakhs as compared with 1,285.      Crops are reported to be in fair to good condition,  though rain is needed in Bombay.      The final forecast for the 1934/5 wheat crop is 34.5 m.  acres and 9.7 m, tons.      The revised estimate of last year&apos;s crop is 36.0 m. acres and 9.4 m.  tens.      The first estimate for the 1935/6 cotton crop is 14,5 m.  acres,  being 12 per cent, more than last year.
