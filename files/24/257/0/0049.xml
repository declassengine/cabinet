(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty5sGovernment)cabinet copy No itGovernment Buildings in Whitehall.Memorandum by the First Commissioner of WorksloMy colleagues will remember that, in September 1932, Isubmitted a comprehensive memorandum on the question 0f the development of the Whitehall Gardens - Montagu House site for the purpose of Government Offices (E.0.02)16).and Employment, I prepared particulars of various building schemes? the suitability of which for inclusion in an expanded Government building programme was determined by the following conditions;(a) The scheme must be justified by needs and on merits and not as relief work.(to) Due regard should be had to considerations such as(1) the net saving effected as compared with the rents at present paid.(2) any Government pledges to carry out the scheme.Among these schemes was the Whitehall Gardens and Montagu House building, the justification for which was, brieflyf as follows(a) the admitted necessity for housing the Air Ministry in onebuilding (instead of eight) and close to the other Defence Services.(b) the urgent demand for headquarters office accommodation in whitehall to relieve existing serious congestion and cver1-crowding in other buildings in the area,  the outhousing of important sections of departments away from their headquarters.(o) the desirability of reducing high rental charges forunsuitable accommodation in the Central London area, and (d) the desirability of removing the present unsightly temporaryAfterwards, at the request of the Cabinet Committee on Tradehuts in the neighbourhood of Montagu Housee
It was also pointed out that this scheme had the outstanding advantage that, while it provides modern office accommodation to meet the current needs of such Departments as the Air Ministry, Board of Trade and the Ministries of Labour, Agriculture and Transport, the ultimate standing charges for interest and sinking fund would amount to less than the rents at present being paid for unsatisfactory accommodation and that, further., the Government would, at the end of the redemption charge period, remain in possession of a freehold site and building,. 30 The Cabinet Committee afterwards approved a proposal of theChancellor of the Exchequer that I should proceed with the necessary preliminaries on this building scheme and report again to the Cabinet when the preliminary investigations and negotiations were completed, on the understanding that no building commitment would be entered into without Cabinet approval,4o In accordance with the decision reached at the meeting of theCabinet on 7th July, 1933 -refeCC*44(33) conclusion 5 - regarding the method of selection of an Architect for this building scheme^ Mr, E, Vincent Harris was appointed in January 1934, and instructed to proceed with the preparation of sketch plans and elevations of the building,,50 During the development of the plans by the Architects, I have considered it desirable to consult the Royal Pine Art Commission and the London County Gouncil as the Town Planning Authority for this area and to ascertain their views, in the initial stages^, as regards height, alignment and general design of the proposed building,,     The negotiations with those two bodies have, of necessity*    been   complicated and protracted but I am glad to say that agreement has now been reached on all the main considerations affecting the development of this site.6&apos; As a result of these negotiations, it has been necessary tomake various fundamental modifications in the design of the building.      The net effect of these alterations is that the
superficial area available for departmental purposes has been reduced from the original estimated figure of 600,000 square feet to 557s500 square feet.     This figure excludes corridors, staircase, lavatory and storage accommodation but inoluoivc ofrefreshment room space0This loss would not, normally, be regarded as serious but, as I indicate later, the staffs of the Departments which it was originally contemplated would be accommodated in the new building have, as a consequence of. legislation and otherwise^ expanded so considerably in the last three years that the area to be provided in the building will fall far short of even minimum requirements for existing staffs with no margin for future expansion,,      I consider, therefore, that it will be necessary to contemplate the redevelopment of the Richmond Terrace site - the last remaining Grown site in Whitehall - at a much earlier date than was originally anticipated,,At the meeting of the Cabinet on the 4th December 193 5 (ref. Co Co 51(30)Conclusion 9) approval was given to the proposal of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries  (CP.224/35) to introduce legislation which would enable the Commissioners of Crown Lands to deal with   the site of Montagu House and Richmond Terrace in the event of building schemes for the development of these sites being approved by the Cabinet.The following figures indicate the expansion that has taken place in the staffs for which it is essential to provide accommodation in the Whitehall areaj

This amount includes all supervision and fees but is exclusive of the cost of acquiring from the Commissioners of Crown Lands the freehold interest of those portions of the site not already vesteu In the Commissioners of &quot;orkso     This, as I indicated in ray memorandum of the 8th September 1932 - EoCo(32)16 - was then estimated at approximately  650,000 and is now (1935) estimated at  675,000*The scheme of development proposed would, after making due allowance for interest on capital, sinking fund charges,  and taking into account the value of the site,  result at the outset in an annual saving of approximately  Bp000 per annum, in the cost of housing the staffs concerned.      (The rate of interest both in respect of land and building has &quot;been taken at 3-gy&apos;b per annum)     This calculation has been made on the assumption that it will be possible to surrender or sublet certain buildings, the rental or annual value of which is approximately  1249 000 per. annura aAs in my previous memorandum no allowance has been made for the value of the economies which should be effected by the Departments as a result of the centralisation of messenger, typing and registry staffs, etCo      On the site at present ls185 Civil Servants are housed;    the new scheme will house 5,360..      The revised financial position Is set out in detail in the appendix,.
H.M, Office of Works. 13th December, 1935.13, I propose that the building should be erected in two sections; first the Northern section, fronting Horseguards Avenue and in about four yearsf time when the first section will be nearing completion, the remainder of the building,14-. As I have already observed in my previous memoranda on thissubject .the case for this building does not rest solely or primarily on financial considerations but mainly on the need, which is becoming daily more urgent,  to provide additional and modern office accommodation in the central Whitehall area to accommodate departments which are now inadequately, -inefficiently   and inconveniently housed in obsolete premises scattered over a wide area,15.   , In these circumstances, I desire to have the approval of mycolleagues to proceed forthwith with the preparation of working drawings and other preliminaries and to make such provision as may be required to meet the cost of the acquisition of the site and of building operations in the Estimates for the ensuing financial yearftW.OAQ,
