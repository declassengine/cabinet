THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1935.MOST SECRET. Copy No.CP. 201 (35).(Also N.C.M. (35) 75.)TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.THE NAVAL CONFERENCE, 1935.Report of Ministerial Committee.THE Ministerial Committee, first set up in April 1934 to consider questions connected with the preparations for a Naval Conference, met on Monday, the 21st October, 1935, to review the course of the preliminary naval negotiations which have taken place in the last twelve months and to consider the steps which should now be taken in this matter.2. The Committee had before them a Joint Foreign Office and Admiralty Memorandum (NUM. (35) 72)* which set forth the developments which had lately taken place in the preliminary conversations with other Powers and discussed the possible courses now open to His Majesty&apos;s Government.3. Notwithstanding the different views that had been put forward by the representatives of the five signatories of the Washington Treaty during the preliminary conversations, and in particular the uncompromising stand on the question of a &quot; common upper limit &quot; taken by Japan, the Committee were of the opinion that steps should be taken at once to call a Conference of the signatory Powers as provided for in Article XXIII of the Washington Treaty, with a view to obtaining, if possible, a new agreement embodying both quantitative and qualitative restrictions, and, if the former was not possible, qualitative restrictions only. The Committee were further of the opinion that even if, as was possible, Japan remained completely uncompromising and refused any sort of co-operation, an endeavour should be made as a last resort to reach a quali-tative agreement with the other three Powers concerned.4. The Committee appreciated that if the terms of the Washington Treaty were to be complied with, and this was important in order that Japan should not be provided with an excuse for not attending, there would be difficulty in arranging for a Conference before the end of 1935 to which the various Govern-ments could send representatives from their own countries, and it was therefore suggested that the Naval Conference should, at all events at the outset, consist of a meeting of Ambassadors, with authoritative naval representation, and that it should meet in December this year, Monday, the 2nd December, being selected as a suitable date for the opening of the Conference. From the political point of view the importance was emphasised of issuing the invitations to the Conference before the date of the General Election.* N.C.M. (35) 72 is attached to this Report as an Annex.[12255]
5.   The Committee therefore recommend (i) That the qualitative limits set out in Section II of the Joint Foreign Office and Admiralty Memorandum (Paper No. N.C.M. (35) 72) should be accepted if found to be the best obtainable under the circumstances; (ii) That the British proposal for an agreement limiting naval construction by means of unilateral declarations for six years should, as a matter of tactics, be brought forward by His Majesty&apos;s Government. In view, however, of the attitude of Japan, France and Italy, it will probably be impossible to reach any agreement at all on quantitative limitation. In that event it is important that the blame for this decision should be made to rest on the three Powers named and not on this country-;(iii) That any future Treaty should include those provisions mentioned inthe list in paragraph 27 of Paper No. N.C.M. (35) 72. That the provisions relating to the non-fortification of possessions in the Pacific (Article XIX of the Washington Treaty) should not be included as this question would best be left for separate treatment between the British Empire, the United States and Japan;(iv) That agreement should be sought with Japan along the lines ofCourse (b) in paragraph 33 of Paper No. N.C.M. (35) 72. Failing this, agreement should be sought along the lines of Course (c), and, failing both these, resort should be made to obtaining a qualitative agreement without Japan, in which the signatory Powers would have the right to depart from the limits laid down in the Treaty should Japan construct a vessel falling outside those limits;.&apos;&quot; (v) That the Foreign Office should be authorised to issue invitations to the signatory Powers of the Washington Treaty to a conference of Ambassadors, with authoritative naval representation, to open in London on the 2nd December, 1935; (vi) That before the Foreign Office issue these invitations, the Ambassadors in London for America, Japan, France and Italy should be informed that these invitations were about to be issued.Signed on behalf of the Committee :STANLEY BALDWIN (Chairman).2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, October 22, 1935.

In this paper it was pointed out that, without under-estimating the importance of quantitative limitation, it was felt that the elimination of competition in the evolution of sizes of ships and gun calibres was a matter of even more urgent importance. It was proposed that, in view of the delay caused hy French hesitation to enter into discussions with us, we should make a written communication to both the French and Italian Governments making definite proposals for future procedure, as indicated in paper N.C.M. (35) 58.2. This action was duly taken. Before making further recommendations for future procedure, it may be useful to give a summary of the terms of the memorandum communicated to the French and Italian Governments and of the subsequent oral and written communications which have passed on the subject with those Governments and with the Governments of the United States and Japan.I. Developments since the joint Foreign Office and Admiralty Memorandumof July 18, 1935.3. A memorandum, dated the 30th July (N.C.M. (35) 61), was communicated to the French and Italian Governments at the beginning of August, setting forth the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom as to the procedure which might with advantage be followed in the matter of the qualitative and quantitative limitation of naval armaments. Without abandoning in any way their proposals for quantitative limitation, His Majesty&apos;s Government expressed the opinion that agreement on qualitative limits appeared to them of more immediate importance than on quantitative limits. If a sufficient measure 8149   [12218]   [12255] b
of European agreement could be reached on qualitative limitation, His Majesty&apos;s Government considered that the United States and Japan should then be approached with a view to a conference of the Washington Powers being held in 1935. His Majesty&apos;s Government at the same time submitted a list of the lowest qualitative limits for various categories of ships likely to be acceptable to the European countries so far consulted. As regards quantitative limitation, His Majesty&apos;s Government suggested that this might be achieved by the various naval Powers issuing unilateral declarations in regard to their building programme intentions over a number of years. It was at the same time explained that agreement would also be desirable as regards the minor provisions of the Washington Treaty and the questions of the reciprocal exchange of information, definitions of categories and standard tonnage under the relevant articles of the Washington and London Treaties.4. In pursuance of a suggestion made by the French Ambassador to Sir Eobert Vansittart last July, Captain Danckwerts paid a visit to Paris on the 6th August in order to break the ice and resume discussions with the French naval authorities. His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s memorandum of the 30th July formed the basis of discussion, and the qualitative limitation figures proposed were fully considered. Generally speaking, the French naval authorities considered that some form of agreement on qualitative limitation during 1935, even without similar agreement on quantitative limitation, was a matter of urgency, but felt that any agreement on the basis of unilateral declarations limiting future construction over such a period as six years might, for technical and parliamentary reasons, be difficult of achievement. The French Minister of Marine and the Chief of the French Naval Staff were agreeable to Captain Danckwerts&apos; suggestion that French representatives should proceed to London in September to resume discussions, but they could give no definite undertaking in that sense without consulting the Quai d&apos;Orsay (N.C. (F.) 6th Meeting).5. On the 14th August the French Government communicated to the Foreign Office their reply to His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s memorandum of the 30th July on limitation in naval armaments (NUM. (35) 63). On the Avhole, the French reply was sympathetic in tone. They concurred in His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s views as to the urgency of reaching agreement on qualitative limitation. Although in general agreement as to the limitation figures proposed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, they could not without further data express any definite opinion. As regards quantitative limitation, the French Government preferred a system of &quot; preavis,&quot; or notice of intention to lay down certain ships after a certain lapse of time, to any unilateral declaration of building programme covering a period of six years, as proposed by His Majesty&apos;s Government. No difference of opinion existed as regards the minor provisions of the Washington and London Treaties. From the French reply, it appears reasonable to suppose that the French Government would be disposed to be represented at a conference on qualitative limitation without putting forward any exaggerated demands.6. On the 19th August enquiries were made of the French Embassy as to whether the French Government would be prepared to send delegates to London in September to take part in preliminary naval conversations. (No invitation to this effect was actually contained in His Majesty&apos;s Governments memorandum of the 30th July.) In conversation with the French Ambassador on the 10th September, Mr. Craigie repeated these enquiries, and M. Corbin promised to refer the question to his Government. Up to the present there has been no communication of French intentions in the matter (N.C.M. (35) 67).7. The reply of the Italian Government, which was transmitted to the Foreign Office on the 4th September, is satisfactory (N.C.M. (35) 65). The Italian Government are ready to adhere to the principle of qualitative limitation and concur in principle with the figures suggested by His Majesty&apos;s Government, provided that they are accepted by all the principal naval Powers. As regards quantitative limitation, they prefer a system providing for the mutual communi-cation by the various Powers of their annual programmes in good time. In the opinion of the Italian Government, all minor provisions of the Washington and London Treaties should be considered at any future conference with a view to reaching general agreement. From this reply, it appears that Italy would raise no difficulties as regards the conclusion of an agreement on qualitative limitation at a naval conference.
8. The United States and Japanese Embassies were not expressly invited to furnish their views on His Majesty&apos;s Governments memorandum of the 30th July, that memorandum having been communicated to them for purposes of information. On the 26th August, however, the Japanese Embassy addressed a reply to the Foreign Office, stating (a) that the Japanese Government believed it important to reach agreement on naval limitation both on the qualitative and quantitative basis, but could not consider qualitative without quantitative limitation, and (b) that His Majesty&apos;s Governments proposal for a unilateral declaration of building programmes was unacceptable as being so much at variance with the Japanese claim to a &quot; common upper limit &quot; (N.C.M. (35) 64). This reply on the face of it was disappointing; but it need not be inferred that Japan will refuse to attend a Naval Conference this year, summoned in accordance with the terms of Article XXIII of the Washington Treaty.9. On the 17th August, the United States Charge d&apos;Affaires communicated to the Foreign Office a summary of his observations on His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ments proposals (N.C.M. (35) 66, Annex II). In doing so, he made it clear that this did not in any way constitute an official reply from the United States Govern-ment. In his communication Mr. Atherton stated that measures of qualitative limitation were devised not to change existing types, but to prevent competition in new types. He complained that His Majesty&apos;s Government were now endeavouring to secure a sufficient measure of European agreement so that they could put forward as a European view proposals which must be unacceptable to-the United States Government. His Government felt that before embarking upon a programme of proposals such as that outlined in His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment&apos;s memorandum of the 30th July, His Majesty&apos;s Government should have-made a further attempt to reconcile differences of opinion existing between Great Britain and the United States. He suggested, therefore, in order to secure a closer approximation of views between the two Governments, that informal discussions should take place at the Foreign Office between United States and British representatives.10. On the 12th September, a memorandum, which was similarly to be regarded as of an unofficial character, was handed personally to Mr. Atherton by Mr., Craigie, with a view to clearing up the misconceptions under which the United States Embassy appeared to be labouring as regards the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the matter of naval limitation (N.C.M. (35) 66,. Annex I). In this memorandum it.was made clear that the objective of His Majesty&apos;s Government in enquiring of the French and Italian Governments their views on qualitative limitation was not to make to the United States or Japanese Governments anything in the nature of joint European proposals, but simply to ascertain the definite views of the French and Italian Governments. It was pointed out to Mr. Atherton that it had always been the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to communicate the facts to the Japanese and United States Governments and to invite an expression of their views before attempting to reach a final opinion as to whether a conference could be usefully held this year. Similarly, it was explained that it had always been in the mind of His Majesty&apos;s Government not only to prevent competition in new types, but also&apos; to secure reduction in existing tonnages and calibres as a means of diminishing the burden of naval armaments. In conclusion, Mr. Atherton was informed that his proposal for an exchange of views through the diplomatic channel was agreeable to His Majesty&apos;s Government. The explanations given by Mr. Craigie appeared to satisfy Mr. Atherton completely as to the procedure which was being followed by His Majesty&apos;s Government.11.   The informal conversations proposed by Mr. Atherton began at the-Foreign Office on the 27th September.   Mr. Atherton, the United States Naval Attache, Mr. Craigie and Captain Danckwerts were present.   Mr. Atherton stated that the general attitude of the United States Government was to salvage^ as much as possible from the Washington and London Treaties, and that the United States Government were ready to pursue qualitative limitation together with such measure of quantitative limitation as was now possible, in the manner set out in His Majesty&apos;s Governments memorandum of the 30th July.   Discussion mainly centred round the question of the size of capital ships.   The United States Naval Attache expressed the readiness of the United States Government [12218] b 2
to accept a 14-inch gun for capital ships, provided that general agreement could be reached on this point. He added that, even if any reduction were admitted in the tonnage of capital ships below the 35,000-ton&apos; ship contemplated by the U.S.A., it would have to be extremely small. The qualitative limits of aircraft carriers proposed by His Majesty&apos;s Government were considered by the United States Naval Attache as probably acceptable to his Government. In the course of the conversation, proposals for the limitation to twelve of the number of guns mounted on capital ships and the possible reduction in size of capital ships after the construction of a few vessels were also considered.12. At a further meeting held on the 1st instant the United States Naval Attache expressed the unwillingness of his Government to accept any reduction in the qualitative limits of cruisers from the Washington Treaty figures of 10,000 tons with 8-inch guns. The importance of securing reduction at least in the calibre of the gun was discussed, as were also the possibilities of limiting large cruisers by number. The United States Naval Attache also displayed anxiety lest the United Kingdom should retain the Hawkins class and thus increase our number of Cruisers A. On this point he received the assurance that it was not His Majesty&apos;s Governments intention to make such a proposal. He expressed his belief that, as regards the qualitative limits for destroyers and submarines, and the other questions mentioned in the British memorandum to the Trench and Italian Governments, the views of the United States Government were in accord with those of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom. The possibility of renewing the Status Quo agreement (Article XIX of the Washington Treaty) and the desirability of extending the rules for submarine warfare (Part IV of the London Naval Treaty) to all Powers were also briefly considered.13. Immediately, after the first meeting had been held with the United States representatives on the 27th September, the Japanese Charge dAffaires was invited to call at the Foreign Office to discuss this question. He was informed that the attitude of the other principal naval Powers displayed an encouraging measure of agreement about the conception of qualitative limitation. As against this, the attitude of the Japanese Government, if maintained in the form expressed in their memorandum of the 26th August last, could only have the effect of blocking any further approach to naval limitation. In the hope of finding-some way round this difficulty, it was suggested that informal conversations might begin through the diplomatic channel between representatives of the Japanese Embassy, the Foreign Office and the Admiralty.14. Mr. Fujii was at the same time informed that a similar conversation on this same subject had taken place that day with the Counsellor of the United States Embassy, and it was hoped that further similar conversations would be held with representatives of the United States Embassy in the near future. A personal and tentative enquiry was also made of the Charge d&apos;Affaires as to whether the situation would be eased for Japan if the period of validity of any quantitative arrangement were to be reduced below six years. The Charge d Affaires undertook to communicate at once with his Government.15. On the 4th October Mr. Atherton informed the Foreign Office verbally, on instructions from his Government, that the Japanese Ambassador had recently enquired of the Secretary of State the American attitude towards (a) the proposal for a naval conference this year, and (&amp;) an agreement regulating qualitative limitation only. The Secretary of State, replied that, in the view of the United States Government, it was desirable that a naval conference should be held before the end of this year. He considered it most important that the limitation of naval armaments should not be allowed to terminate completely, and hoped that a solution could now be found for those elements of the problem on which agree-ment could be reached. In this way it would be possible to tide over the situation temporarily. The Secretary of State also believed that both qualitative and quantitative limitation should-be continued, and expressed the opinion that it should not be difficult to work out some mutually satisfactory arrangement for continuing existing types of ships.16. Mr. Atherton then stated privately and confidentially in reply to Mr. Craigie&apos;s enquiry of the 12th September, the opinion of the United States Government as to what should be done in the event of it proving impossible to
induce the Japanese Government to sign any naval treaty dealing with qualita-tive limitation. His Government considered that in that case it would be desirable for the United Kingdom and the United States to reach a naval agree-ment without Japan, on the understanding that the Japanese would undertake not to construct vessels of a type likely to upset the general agreement. This agreement should also, if possible, include France and Italy, with the necessary clause of elasticity, and should be left open for Japanese adherence at any time. Mr. Atherton added that in view of the provisions of the Washington and London Treaties, and since the initiative rested in British hands, his Government believed it desirable that His Majesty&apos;s Government should arrange the summoning of a conference before the end of the year, preferably in consultation with the American Government. It seemed preferable that His Majesty&apos;s Government, if they decided to summon the conference, should cover the provisions of both Treaties.17. Finally, a semi-official letter was received from the Italian Ambassador on the 7th October, in which he stated that &quot; Italy would be ready to send her naval experts to London for preliminary conversations regarding the next naval conference Avhich is to take place in the near future.&quot; From this it may be assumed that Italy is prepared to participate in a conference if one is summoned.18. In this connexion it should be observed that the possibility of develop-ments in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute may at any moment block further progress in the present talks and jeopardise the prospects of a successful conference. While in many respects it may seem paradoxical that we should be discussing naval limitation at a time when the issue of peace and war hangs in the balance, the continuation of discussions with the Italians through the diplomatic channel and the sending of an invitation to the Italian Government to attend an Ambassadors&apos; Conference, would be consistent with the general attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government, namely, that the dispute is one between Italy and the League and not between Italy and this country. Judging from the Italian memorandum avhich is summarised above and the information in $ 17, it seems probable that, unless the situation takes a definite turn for the worse, Italy will be willing to take part in a conference on this subject. It is therefore suggested that, as long as we remain in normal relations with Italy, we should proceed with our efforts to bring about an agreement between the Washington Powers for the limitation of naval armament, leaving to Italy the responsibility of either refusing the invitation or otherwise obstructing progress.II. Present Position.19. The situation resulting from these various exchanges and from the earlier conversations may now be summarised as follows :  (a) Qualitative Limitation.20. The United States, French, Italian and German Governments are all prepared, faute de mieux, to become parties to an international agreement dealing with qualitative limitation only. The concurrence of the United States is, however, dependent on the acceptance of their proposals for heavier tonnage in the case of capital ships and cruisers than we consider necessary or desirable. The Japanese Government, on the other hand, while regarding it as of importance &quot; to reach agreement on general naval limitation comprising both qualitative and quantitative limits, are unable to agree to consider only qualitative limits apart from quantitative limits.&quot;21. Assuming that it were possible to reach some compromise on this subject with Japan, the limits at which it seems possible that an international agreement on qualitative limitation might be attained are the following :  Capital Ships. 35,000 tons with a 14-inch gun (instead of a 16-inch gun as under the Washington Treaty). This is the lowest limit to which the United States Government are at present prepared to agree, although their representa-tives have suggested the possibility that, with the experience gained in the construction of the first two new capital ships, the United States Government might be prepared to agree to a reduction of from 1,000 to 2,000 tons in the displacement of future ships.
Assuming that all the principal naval Powers, including Japan but excluding the United States, were prepared to agree to a 30,000-ton capital ship with a 14-inch gun, it has been tentatively suggested by the United States representatives that the United States of America should be left free to build capital ships up to 35,000 tons, on the understanding that the total capital ship tonnage of the United States should not exceed the total capital ship tonnage of the British Empire. Such a proposal implies the prior conclusion of a quantitative agreement laying down a definite ratio of naval strength as between the United States, Japan and the British Empire, and of this there is, at the moment, no hope whatever. But, apart from this, there are technical objections to the proposal, of which the following may be mentioned : The balance of tonnage, allowed to the individual units to be built by the United States of America would permit the construction of ships superior in some or all of the important qualities other than gun calibre. Thus, they might have a greater number of guns, greater speed, greater air or anti-aircraft armament and, most important of all, greater protection against above-water and under-water attack. A limitation of the number of guns to 12, as suggested by the United States Embassy, would not equalise the position, because it would still be impossible to put an equal number of guns into the smaller ship without accepting inferiority in some other quality. Even if the number of ships could be limited, the advantage would rest with the United States of America in possessing a battlefieet of individually more powerful vessels. Since, in the ultimate resort, sea power rests upon the fighting strength of the battlefieet, this situation would be far removed from parity.In the absence of any quantitative agreement, it is desirable to negotiate if possible a minimum limit to the size of any capital ship that may be constructed and the calibre of its guns, so as to produce a gap between the capital ship and the cruiser and make the cruiser qualitative limitation effective. France and USA. are known to agree with this proposition, but the views of Italy and Japan on it are quite unknown.Aircraft Carriers. 20,000 to 22,000 tons with a 6-1-inch gun.Cruisers. Construction of cruisers during the period of the agreement to be limited to cruisers not exceeding 10,000 tons with a 6-1-inch gun. (The effort to limit the number of large 6-inch gun cruisers has not been actually abandoned, but the attitude of the United States is not favourable to the proposal, and the Japanese Government are also unlikely to agree.)Destroyers. 1,850 tons with a 5-1-inch gun (as in the London Naval Treaty), provided that agreement can be reached with the European Powers for making a division in the future between cruisers and destroyers. Since the prospects of such agreement are slight and it is undesirable that this country should continue to be at a disadvantage in this respect vis-a-vis of the other European Powers, it seems probable that there will be in the future a single category for cruisers and destroyers.Submarines. Retention of the London Naval Treaty limits, namely,. 2,000 tons displacement with a 5 - 1-inch gun.22. While it is obvious that the limits mentioned above are in some respects in excess of what we should like, the Admiralty and Foreign Office feel that, both from a technical and political point of view, it would be better to get agreement even on these relatively high limits than to see the naval Powers relapse into competition in the evolution of new and possibly even larger types of ships a competition which has proved so costly in the past. The Admiralty, indeed, consider that from the point of view of reducing expense, the attainment of an agreement on qualitative limitation is even more important and urgent than on quantitative limitation.   (See paper N.C.M. (35) 58, paragraph 4.)(b)   Quantitative Limitation.23.   The position may be summarised as follows :  While the United States tend to be insistent on their qualitative views, they have moved on the quantitative side a considerable distance from the attitude which they have consistently followed since the Geneva Naval Conference of 1927. For instance, they have recognised our need for a larger number of cruisers, and are not likely to put pressure on us about numbers, though they will maintain
parity. The U.S. Government are also less insistent than they were on building cruisers with 8-inch guns, and they are prepared to reduce the calibre of gun for the capital ship from 16-inch to 14-inch.24. With the exception of the United States and Germany no Power has accepted, as a basis of discussion, the British proposal for an agreement based on the making by each Power of a voluntary declaration limiting the new construc-tion which it proposes to undertake over a period of, say, six years. Japan objects on the ground that the effect of this programme is to perpetuate the existing ratio in fact if not in name. France and Italy consider that the difficulties in the way of any such quantitative limitation are almost insuperable, and that it will be necessary for the Powers&apos; to content themselves with giving advance notice of their programmes of construction (i.e., the system of the &quot; preavis &quot;). While therefore it may still be desirable, as a matter of tactics, that His Majesty&apos;s Government should submit to any naval conference that may be held a definite proposal for the regulation of future construction on the above basis, it is now most unlikely that the plan will secure general acceptance, at all events for so long a period as six years. As an alternative, the French system of the &quot; preavis &quot; merits consideration. The difference between the French system and the British system is that, while under the first each Power would notify to the others, as far ahead as possible, the actual programme of construction, complete with all details, which it intends to put in hand in any given financial year, the British system provides that each Power should declare that, during a given period, its new construction in each category would not exceed a certain maximum. The main difficulty about the French system is that it would, unless the period of notice were to be quite short, appear to encroach on parliamentary prerogatives. For instance, in the case of this country, it would obviously be impossible to make to a foreign Government a notification in regard to the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to embark on a definite programme of construction before parliamentary sanction for that programme had been obtained. The British proposal of giving a maximum tonnage figure in each category is, however, free from this objection, seeing that Parliament would always be in the position to reduce the figure of actual construction below the maximum figure so communicated, and generally to modify the details of the programme for any given year within that maximum figure. A compromise with the French view has been tentatively and unofficially suggested by the Foreign Office to the Japanese Charge d&apos;Affaires on the basis of reducing the period to be covered by the declarations of construction from six to, say, two years. This would be accompanied by a proposal limiting the period of the &apos;&apos; preavis &apos;&apos; to, sajr, six months (i.e., the normal interval between the passage of our naval estimates through Parliament and the laying down of the ships so authorised).25. It must be remembered that the original Admiralty proposal for a treaty regulating quantitative limits for ten years has already been reduced to six. (See Z\T.C.M. 35 (1) Part II.) The Admiralty dislike a two year agreement. The objection to a short-term agreement of this kind is that it would necessitate the holding of a further conference on quantitative limitation shortly, and the future strength of fleets would remain as uncertain as with no quantitative treaty at all. The British programmes for these two years are likely to be so large as to be not only misleading as to our genuine intentions, but to make the arrangement value-less for the purpose of limiting or reducing construction by any other Power. It is true a two j^ears&apos; agreement would have its uses if it enabled us to overcome Japan&apos;s objection to the conclusion of a qualitative treaty, and if Japan were to agree that the qualitative arrangement would be for a longer duration than the quantitative one. Although the choice before us, so far as quantitative limitation is concerned, may be either a short-term agreement of this character or no quantitative agreement at all, the Admiralty consider that a two years&apos; quantita-tive agreement is definitely undesirable. The Foreign Office, while agreeing that a longer agreement would be far preferable, consider that the shorter agreement, if obtainable, may on this occasion serve a definite purpose. Many competent observers forecast that during the next two years moderating influences are likely to make themselves increasingly felt in the conduct of Japan&apos;s foreign policy, with the result that the Cabinet would be in a position to exercise better control over the extremists at the Japanese Ministry of Marine. (This assumes, of course, that war does not, in the meantime, break out in Europe.)   If, however, at the end of
that period, Japan is still disinclined to enter into a long-term agreement oh a reasonable basis, it will be time enough to consider whether the effort to preserve the limitation of naval armaments should be definitely abandoned.26. The present position of France and Italy is that they are not agreeable to any quantitative limitation, though they are in favour of a system of advance notice (&quot; preavis &quot;) see paragraph. 5 above.(c) Other Provisions of the Treaty.27. The other provisions upon which it is hoped to reach agreement are the exchange of information, and the minor provisions of the Washington Treaty contained in Articles XIV, XVII and XVIII, dealing with preparations for the installation of armaments in merchant ships, the use of vessels of war under con-struction by other Powers, and the sale of vessels of war from one Contracting Power to another. The attitude of Japan towards the exchange of information is doubtful, but no difficulty is anticipated in reaching agreement with all Powers on the other points.III. Possible Courses open to His Majesty&apos;s Government.28. The relevant provisions of the Washington and London Naval Treaties dealing with the summoning of a new conference are as follows :  Article XXIII, paragraph 2, of the Washington Naval Treaty :  &quot; Within one year of the date on which a notice of termination by any Power has taken effect, all the Contracting Powers shall meet in conference.&apos;&apos;(Japan&apos;s notice of termination took effect on the 29th December. 1934.)Article 23, paragraph 2, of the London Naval Treaty : &quot; Unless the High Contracting Parties should agree otherwise by reason of a more general agreement limiting naval armaments, to which they all become parties, they shall.meet in conference in 1935 to frame a new treaty to replace and to carry out the purposes of the present Treaty, it being understood that none of the provisions of the present Treaty shall prejudice the attitude of any of the High Contracting Parties at the conference agreed to.&quot;29. Under each of the above provisions the summoning of a conference is mandatory, although the responsibility for taking the initiative does not rest with any one Power. In all the preparatory discussions His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have taken the initiative and, should they now decide that the results of the preparatory conversations do not justify their taking the further step of summoning a conference, it is desirable that the other Washington Powers should be so informed at the earliest possible moment. Otherwise, they may lay them-selves open to the criticism that, having taken the initiative hitherto but failed to summon a conference, they have blocked the path of any other Power which might in other circumstances have been ready to summon a conference.30. If a conference is summoned by His Majesty&apos;s Government, what are the chances of a successful outcome ?31. So far as the United States, France, Italy and this country are concerned, there seems every reason to believe that agreement could be reached on the qualitative limits set forth in section II (a) of this memorandum, on exchanges of advance information in regard to building intentions and on other minor provisions of the Washington and London Naval Treaties. (We also have the assurance of the German Government that they, too, would agree on all these points.) It is the definite opinion of the Admiralty that an agreement on these lines, if it could be made universal, would be of the greatest possible value in avoiding a race in new types and sizes of ships and in keeping down expense. From the political point of view also such an agreement would be of considerable value, particularly if the public were gradually prepared beforehand for the dropping of the quantitative form of limitation.
32. The question of the success or failure of a conference therefore depends on the attitude of Japan towards our proposals and on the extent to which the other Washington Powers are prepared to continue qualitative limitation between themselves, irrespective of Japan&apos;s attitude.33.   Japan may/ (a) Remain completely uncompromising and refuse any sort of co-operation.(b) Refuse to sign any treaty, but enter into a &quot; gentlemahs agreement&quot;that no Power will, without giving notice to the contrary, build types of ships which would fall outside the limits mutually agreed upon.(c) Sign a  qualitative treaty provided  that  a short-term  quantitativearrangement (i.e., something less than the six years&apos; arrangement which she rejects) can be reached simultaneously.Course (b) above is on the whole the most probable, but, in estimating the chances, of success, we must take all these possibilities into account.34. The Admiralty view is that the conference should be called as already laid down in the previous treaties, and they do not consider that if it should prove a failure on account of the attitude of Japan, any odium would be cast on His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Admiralty also recommend that course (b) above should be accepted unless, better still, Japan falls in with the views of the other Powers when faced with their united front at the conference table.35. The view of the Foreign Office is as follows : If, relying on the arrangement outlined in paragraph 36 below, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to enter into an agreement with the other naval Powers irrespective of the course which Japan may choose, a not unimportant result from the conference is assured in advance. If, on the other hand, His Majesty&apos;s Government were to decide that, should Japan adopt course (a), they must, on that account, refuse to be bound by a qualitative treaty with the other Washington-Powers, then the risk of failure is considerable. It is true that the responsibility for that failure could be squarely placed on the shoulders of Japan, but it is inevitable that criticism should also be directed against the Government which had taken the initiative in summoning a conference, and His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment may in that event deem it wiser not to take the risk.36. It should be observed that, as stated in paragraph 16 of this memo-randum, the United States Government would be ready to conclude a treaty with the other Washington Powers whichever course Japan were to follow. Although the point has not yet been put to the French and Italian Governments, it may be assumed that they would conform their attitude in this matter to that taken up-by the United Kingdom and the United States. It should also be remembered in this connexion that much greater elasticity could be retained under a qualitative than under a quantitative treaty. Thus, the proposed qualitative treaty could be drafted in such a way that any signatory Power would have the right to depart from the limits laid down in the treaty should any non-signatory Power construct a vessel falling outside those limits. Liberation from treaty limits would thus be automatic and would depend solely on the fact of an &quot; irregular &quot; construction by a non-signatory Power. There need be none of the difficulty associated with the invocation of an &quot; escalator &quot; clause, as in the case of a quantitative treaty.37. A decision on the points raised in the paragraphs 32-36 above seems to-be essential before it is possible to estimate with any degree of accuracy the chances of success or failure of the proposed conference.38. The courses open to His Majesty&apos;s Government may now be summarised as follows : --(1) To inform the other signatory Powers that, having regard to the-absence of any satisfactory basis of agreement between the Powers with which this country has been in consultation, His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to take no further initiative in this matter.(2) To propose the postponement of the conference until next year.[12218] c
(3) To summon a formal conference in the knowledge that the United States will insist on her maximum qualitative demands, but in the hope that Japan, once in conference, may find it easier to participate in such measure of agreement in&apos; other matters as the other four Powers may find possible. (If such an invitation is to be despatched, this should be done not later than the middle of October, since the Japanese Government always require at least two months&apos; notice for the necessary preparations, and the long journey to Europe.)(4) To carry on the present diplomatic discussions with the representatives of the four Powers to a point at which it would be possible to summon, before the end of the present year, a Meeting of Ambassadors in London which could put the finishing touches to any agreement that might be in sight.(5) To combine courses (3) and (4) as follows : Notify the Washington Powers at once that, unless any one of them raises serious objection, it is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to issue invitations to a Conference at which the various countries could be represented by their Ambassadors, assisted by naval experts. It is suggested that at such a conference this country could appropriately be represented by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the First Lord of the Admiralty. The conference could be summoned to meet on, say, the 1st December, in London, to carry out the purposes of Article XXIII of the Washington Treaty and Article 23 of the London Naval Treaty.39. Course (1) is a counsel of despair. If once it were followed, it would become more than ever difficult at some future time to gather together again the strings of this complex problem and to find a basis of agreement even on qualitative limitation. Such progress as has been achieved and such clarification of the varying attitudes as has been made in the past two years of preparation would be sacrificed..40. Course (2), while superficially attractive, is open to two serious objections. As things stand, the other signatories of the Washington Treaty are bound to attend a conference if summoned by one of the signatories during the present year, but indications are that Japan might be unwilling to do so next year except on her own terms. The second difficulty is that, owing to the necessity of getting out the designs of warships many months ahead of the date when the keel is laid down, the various Governments must, like His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, be on the eve of taking decisions in regard to future qualitative limits which may prove irrevocable (see also N.CM. (35) 58, paragraph 1). Thus, from the qualitative point of view, a conference next year would probably prove much less useful than one held before the end of the present year. It would, however, always be possible to propose a postponement of the conference should the negotiations proposed under course (5) prove abortive.41. In all the circumstances it is felt that course (5) offers the best prospects of success. Since the result we can hope for is relatively limited (i.e., qualitative limitation plus the minor provisions of existing treaties, as a six years&apos; programme now seems impossible), it would seem unnecessary to go to the expense, trouble and publicity of summoning a full dress conference (course (3) ). If foreign Govern-ments desire to send technical advisers to assist their Embassies, this could be done without undue publicity in the course of the bilateral talks which, in the meantime, would be continued. Similarly, the Dominions could, if they so desire, be represented by their High Commissioners in London, though this may not be considered necessary during the technical discussions.Summary.42. The position under Section III of this memorandum may therefore be summarised as follows : Both the Admiralty and the Foreign Office consider that, in all the circumstances, a conference should be summoned at once, on the lines suggested under course (5), paragraph 38.
43. The Foreign Office, like the Admiralty, consider a qualitative treaty obtained on the lines of course (&amp;), paragraph 33, the least objectionable alter-native. The Foreign Office also suggest that, if Japan were to follow course (a) or course (c), acceptance by His Majesty&apos;s Government of a qualitative agreement with the other Washington Powers would, in the last resort, be preferable to a complete breakdown of the conference. In that case, the risk of a failure of the conference would be practically nil.44. The Admiralty, on the other hand, consider that, if Japan were to follow course (a), a qualitative agreement with the other three Washington Powers would be unacceptable, but agree that if necessary (c), as it does not affect our naval security, could be accepted if it is considered politically expedient to do so in order to obtain a long-term five-Power qualitative treaty.October 11, 1935.o
