JIDENTIAL. A. C.334.BOARD 0? TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.STATE 0? TRADE - SEPTEMBER,  193 5.Summary of reports submitted by members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some cases with statistical information from other sources).OVERSBAS. TRADE.      Imports in September at  60. 8m. were  2.9m.  more than in September last year.    This was due mainly  to an increase or  2.3m.  in manufactured goods,  of Which  0.8m.  was represented by non-ferrous metals and  0,5 m. by motor spirit. Exports of United Kingdom produce at  34.1m. were only slightly higher than a year ago.      Re-exports amounted to  3.8m.  as against  3.2m.   last year.EMPLOYMENT,       The total number of unemployed persons on the registers of Employment Exchanges at 23rd September was 1,958,310,  an increase of 10,61-6 as compared with a month earlier.The main variations werej-London............. t       611South Eastern...... +    9,168South Western ...... 5,501Midlands........... - 17,365North Eastern...... -    3,729North Western ...... -       638Scotland........... *    7,0b2Wales.............. -t&quot; 10,046The estimated number of insured persons aged 16-64 in employment at 23rd September was   10,435,000,      This was 11,000 more than a month earlier and 192,000 more than a year ago.An improvement in employment was recorded in coal mining, the woollen and worsted industry, hosiery manufacture,  the clothing trades (including boot and shoe manufacture),  steel&quot; melting,  rolling,  etc.,  and the pottery,  tinplate and motor vehicle,  cycle  and aircraft industries.      On the other hand there was a decline in the distributive trades, building and public
works contracting,  shipbuilding and ship-repairing,  genera] engineering, certain food industries,  linen manufacture and the fishing industry.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.      During the four weeks ended 29th September railway traffic receipts decreased by  178,000 (1.45$)  as compared with the corresponding period of 1934.    The decrease amounted to 0.6$ in passenger traffic, 4$ in coal, coke,  etc.,  and 1.15$ in freight train traffic.      The total receipts for the 39 weeks ended 29th September amounted to  113.4m. as against  112.8m.  for the  same period of 1934.SHIPPING AND SHIPBUILDING.      The Chamber of Shipping index number for freights (1913 = 100) was 80.13 as against 78.25 in August and 88.38 in September,  1934.The amount of laid up tonnage at ports in Great Britain and Ireland at 1st October is provisionally estimated at 502,000 net tons as against 588,000 net tons on July 1st and 818,000 net tons a year ago.The amount of tonnage commenced in the quarter ended 30th September last was 119,000 gross tons as against 108,000 gross tons last quarter end 77,000 gross tons last year.BANKING.      Money was extremely easy during most of the month, but the market has been dominated by developments abroad.    The Treasury Bill rate fell to 10/7d. during the last three weeks of September owing to the demand for late December maturities..      In the foreign exchange market the normal seasonal demand for the dollar has been accentuated by Continental buying owing to the international situation.    During the month the spot rate appreciated from 4.96 to 4.91.      The French franc has been firm around 74f.      The guilder was under heavy pressure but made a recovery on the raising of the Dutch bank rate;    the immediate outlook is, however,  obscure.      The gold market was fairly quiet until the end of the month when
the appreciation of the dollar caused a movement of geld te the United States.      The silver market has &quot;been steady.ENGINEERING.    All available data indicate that the industry is continuing to expand and that prospects for the remainder of the year are good.      The machine tool and aircraft trades are in particular well occupied and export orders in te textile machinery have shown, some improvement.      The increase in the amount of loans to Local Authorities by the Ministry of Health is providing a fair volume of work in the general engineering section.Exports of machinery in September amounted to    3,062,000 as against  2,64-2,000 in September, 1934.There is a steady expansion in exports to Empire markets, particularly of mining machinery to South Africa.COAL.    The average weekly output of coal during the 13 weeks ended October 5th was 4,052,000 tons as compared with 4,053,000 tons in the same quarter of 1934, a decrease of 0.04%, The average number of persons employed during the period was 749,000 as compared with 762,000 a year before.- Exports in September amounted to 2,929,000 tons as compared with 3,541,000 tons last year, larger quantities being taken by the Irish Free State, Canada and Germany.      There was, however, a considerable decline in shipments to Italy and smaller declines to Scandinavian countries, France, Belgium, Greece, North Africa and Brazil.IRON AND STEEL.      There was the usual seasonal improvement in business in September.      Specifications against contracts are reaching the works with regularity, and a large tonnage of steel is passing into consumption.      Export business shows signs of improvement.      pig-iron and semi-finished, steel remains in steady demand;    in the finished steel department a certain irregularity has been reported, but on the whole  the tendency has been for demand to strengthen.Scotland.      The works are maintaining a high level of operations.      Bookings of semi-finished material have been very
satisfactory, much business arriving from structural engineers and a further expansion is expected. There has been a welcome improvement in the number of orders for new ships. Tube and sheet makers and steel bar re-rollers have good business on hand, but wrought iron manufacturers were only moderately busy. Many branches report some progress in the export trade, particularly with the Empire.North gast Coast.      Busy conditions prevailed and pressure from consumers to obtain delivery was considerable. Demand for billets and,  to a lesser extent,  for sheet bars, was particularly strong and most steel works are assured of good business for some months to come.      Sheet mills have increased their bookings recently, but makers of railway material have worked off a large proportion of their orders and will be glad of further business.Sheffield.      A high level of activity is being maintained and some plants are now working to almost full capacity.    The demand for basic billets and to some extent for acid billets shows signs of expansion and strip mills are well employed. Stainless steel continues in good demand.South Wales.      Conditions have been fairly steady and further improvement is expected.      The production of semi-finished material has been at a satisfactory level and demand appears to be increasing on account of greater activity in the tinplate industry which is now working at a slightly better capacity than a month ago.      The demand for structural steel was especially brisk and makers of railway materials have been well employed.MOTOR INDUSTRY.      The number of motor vehicles newly registered in August was 23,343,  or 3,727 more than in August, 1934,  the increase comprising 6,368 private cars and 359 other vehicles.
The estimated production of motor cars and taxis for ..the ten months ended 31st July was 267,000 as against 229,000 in the  same period of the 1933/4 season.      The estimated production of commercial vehicles for the ten months period was 78,300 as against 72,100 in 1933/4.      August sales of motor cars were 6,493 more than in August,  1934,  representing an increase of nearly 59$.      To some extent these increased sales were due to the uninterrupted production of series which are not being subjected to major or minor revisions  in design.During the first eight months of 1935 new motor vehicle exports increased by 6,842 units to a total of 43,811.    private car exports increased by 18.8$ and commercial vehicles by 17.5$. Imports of complete private cars were 1,200 less in August than in the corresponding month last year.LIGHT METAL INDUSTRIES.      In non-ferrous metals the demand for brass and copper tubes has been well maintained,  but has slackened off for rolled metal and wire.      There has been further expansion in the cutlery,  silver and electro-plate trades,  and the small tool trades are fully employed.      Press work,  the foundry trade,  enamelled hollow-ware and the  lock and allied trades are all experiencing satisfactory conditions.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.      In general active conditions prevailed in all sections of the industry and are expected to continue during the next few months.      Enquiries for heavy engineering plant have not been quite so numerous lately,  due possibly to the unsettled international situation.      In most classes of installation material and light  apparatus production to date this year shows a considerable increase over 1934.      The consumption of electricity during September amounted to 1,320m units,  an increase of 15.6$ over the same month last year.    The aggregate increase for the first nine months of 1935 when compared with 1934 amounts to  12.4$.
COTTON.      In September cotton production snd employment failed to show the usual seasonal expansion and exports declined.      Average weekly deliveries of raw cotton to spinners in September were 20.82m.  lbs.  as compared with 20.01m.  in August and 21.47m.  in September,  1934.      prices showed a marked upward trend during the month.      Takings of Indian cotton showed an increase over August.Yarn -prices in the American section snowed little alteration,  so that spinners&apos;  margins were probably reduced. In the Egyptian section, however, yarn prices increased sufficiently to compensate for the higher cost of the raw material and margins remained steady .Yarn exports in September at 10. lm.  lbs. ,  though above the level of September,  1934, were 1.8m.  lbs.  less than in August,  tne decline being especially marked in grey yarns and in exports to G-ermeny.      Exports of piece goods in September amounted to 150.3m. sq. yards which is 10.3m.   sq.  yards below September last year.      Compared with August exports of bleached, printed and dyed piece goods decreased,  while exports of grey and coloured cloths improved somewhat.      Exports to India, South Africa, Australia,  and Argentina showed a decline, but there was a marked increase in sales to British West Africa and smaller increases to New Zealand, Canada, Denmark and French West Africa.The Clare-Lees-Liody Pact, regulating trade with India, expires at the end of this year,  and a delegation is to put the Lancasnire case for lower tariffs before the Indian Tariff Board.HIDES AND LEATHER.      Prices of Aides of all classes have advanced steadily as the result of the political situation and the demand for leather for military preparations.     Leather prices have not yet reached a level which compensates the tanner for tne higher prices of his raw material.
SILK AND ARTIFICIAL&apos; SILK.      Business in rayon yarns i s on the quiet side and sales at the moment are disappointing.      In the weaving trade the demand for acetate yarn is brisk, but it has fallen off considerably in warp knitting.      There is a steadily growing demand for staple fibre.      In the weaving section furnishings and some  parts of the dress goods trade are fairly busy, while the hosiery trade is normal.The price of raw silk has increased slightly during the month.      It is still impossible to obtain any reliable quotation for Italian silk.      The price of natural silk still remains so low that it is a very serious competitor to rayon in the hosiery trade.POTTERY.      August is a quiet month in  the  pottery industry, but reports from all sections indicate  that  sales on  the whole were satisfactory being,  in general,  a little better than in the same month last year.      In the china-ware section prospects for the Autumn and Christmas trade are considered to be very promising.CHEMICALS.      Deliveries of alkalies,  chlorine products and most industrial nitrogen products in both the home and export trades reached a satisfactory level in September.      Home sales of dye stuffs   -showed an increase, but export sales were down. Sulphate of ammonia  sales in the home market showed a decrease as compared with last year, but buyers have not yet placed their orders for forward delivery.      There was a substantial increase in exports to Australia, New Zealand and India,  but foreign markets snowed some falling off.      Coal tar products were in active demand, but trade was quiet in all wood distillation products.PAPER. Demand in most sections in September showed a definite recovery from the seasonal decline of August and a slight improvement over  last year.      The market for certain
printing papers was, however,  affected by the international situation.      The export trade was well maintained, particularly in newsprint to Australia.      Imports of paper and board were higher than in September last year.RETAIL TRADE.      The money value of retail sales in August was 4.1% greater than in August,  1934.      Sales of food and perishables continue to expand,  the increase for August being 7.1)3 as compared with a rise of 6.2$ for February to July. Sales of other merchandise, however,  only increased by 1.9$ during August as against 3.6% for February to July.      The drapery trade experienced an unsatisfactory month.      The only area of the country&apos;to  snow a decline during August was London (Central and west End)  where the sales were 2.5$ below the 1934 level.CO-OPERATIVE trade the Co-operative Wholesale Society&apos;s sales for the four weeks ended 7th September show an increase of 7$ over a year ago.      The weighted average of the wholesale prices of seven of  the principal commodities show an increase of 7.-13$ as compared with last y^ar and the weighted average of the retail prices of the same commodities increased by 3.59$,CANADIAN. TRADE.     ,The economic situation showed further improvement in August and the index of the physical volume of business was 107,9 as against 103 in. the -preceding month. Copper- nickel and zinc exports and- the production of lead increased, while imports of bauxite snowed a considerable rise, host sections of the  foodstuffs industry snowed greater activity,  except slaughtering and meat packing.      Slight gains were shown in the output of newsprint and the export of wood pulp,  and there was a large increase in the exports of planks and boards.      There was a seasonal decline in the production cf motor cars.AUSTRALIAN......TRADE.      434,000 bales of wool have beenreceived into  store  since 1st July as compared with 426,000 a
year ago,  and 5,900 were sold or shipped as against 7,400 last season.      Wheat and flour shipments for the period 1st December to 25th September  are equivalent to 35.1m. bushels of wheat as against 75.9m.  bushels.      Exports of butter for the period 1st July to 21st September now amount to 8,497 tons as compared with 10,636 tons a year ago.      The total imports of merchandise during August were valued at  8. 96m. (Australian currency)  as compared with  8.70m.  in August 1934.The wool selling season opened at a substantial advance on the rates ruling at the commencement of last  season,  and after  some subsequent weakness the market is stronger and c o mp e t i t i o n keen.SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE.      Activity in  the Union continues at a high level, but signs are not wanting that the pace of progress is slowing down.      Imports in July snowed an increase over those of a year before, due mainly to large purchases of mining and industrial machinery.      Exports in July also snowed a considerable increase over last year, due mainly to increased exports of gold.      Farming prospects are generally favourable,  though rain is wanted in some areas.      wool prices have continued steady and it is estimated that the clip for 1935/35 will exceed that for the past season by some 35m.  lbs. Lianufacturing industry in the Union remains well employed.INDIA&apos;! TRADE.      Imports of merchandise in August amounted to 1,119 lakhs of rupees as against 1,063 in August,   1934, while ex-ports snowed a slight decrease at 1,204 lakhs as compared with 1,234.      Rainfall has been general  throughout India,  with the exception of Sind,   and crops are reported to be in average to good condition and prospects are favourable. The final forecast of the jute crop is 6,397,000 bales as compared with 7,964,000 bales last year.
SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.Argentina.     G-ood rains have fallen over practically the whole agricultural zone,  though they have come too late to do much good.      It is expected,  for instance, that the exportable wheat surplus will be under 5 m.   tons compared with an average of nearly 4 m.  tons for the last four years.      The most noticeable feature of the latest reports is the steady rise in all cereal prices, due to the political situation,  to the drought and to the more bullish prospects and statistical position in other parts of the world.      The demand for linseed has been spasmodic,  though prices have risen with other cereals.      General improvement is also apparent in wool and cotton, but the meat export trade is less buoyant.Imports for August were the highest for any month in 1935. Imports of cotton yarns and cloths from the United Kingdom have been gradually increasing and the outlook for woollen goods is also promising.      The United Kingdom share, however,  of the total imports for the first seven months has decreased from 22.8$ in 1934 to 22.1% in 1935.Exports continue to run at a higher level then in 1934, though their better snowing is helped by a rise in average prices. The latest financial returns are encouraging,  and there is some suggestion that the possibility of abolishing foreign exchange control may be considered.Brazil.     The coffee position is not very favourable, although the exports to date for 1935 show an increase over those for the  same period of 1934.      In the first half of September prices in the consuming markets advanced,  but a rise in the exchange value oi the milreis caused local prices to ease slightly and made business difficult;    The cotton market has improved slightly after showing a very weak tendency throughout August, Local industries have been doing well, particularly shoe factories and textile mills.
In the first hall of September there was a slight improvement in tne sterling value of the milreis,  but part of the rise was subsequently lost.      The general position in the exchange market was further complicated at the beginning of August by new regulations.      The ensuing uncertainty has not been conducive   to exchange stability.Chile.      Generally speaking the country is doing much better and the outlook is good.      Overseas trade  shows considerable increases in all classes of imports,  except manufactured foodstuffs.      Exports have also increased,  though not to the seme extent.Perul     The cotton market has shown a very uneven tendency. The shortage in the rice crop is causing concern and it is thought that it may be necessary to import some 200,000 bags to meet domestic requirements.      In the Budget estimates the Minister of Finance is providing the maximum sum possible for the external debt service, but this will necessarily be comparatively small.Colombias      Shipments of coffee during July showed a considerable increase over those of July,  1934.      Imports of cotton goods from the United Kingdom, during 1934 were considerably in excess of those from all other countries combined,  in spite of Japanese competition.      A Trade Agreement has been signed with the United States of America under which both countries accord unrestricted most-favoured-nation terms. a special Trade Mission is expected shortly from Germany.WOOL.      There was a general improvement in  the activity of the industry during September.      Exports of yarns  showed little change as cocrpared with august.      Exports of tops increased slightly, &quot;out there was a considerable reduction in the export of tissues.      There was little change in raw wool prices during the month.
Notwithstanding the recent expansion in activity, reports from&apos;the various wool textile districts indicate  that there is little accumulation of orders and that home and foreign customers continue to exercise caution in regard to forward commi allotments.
