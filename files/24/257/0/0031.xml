THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1935.SECRET.&apos; Copy No.CP. 211 (35).CABINET.AIR NAVIGATION BILL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.I ASK the Cabinet to approve the principles of a Bill that has been prepared for the purpose of amending and supplementing the Air Navigation Act, 1920, and to authorise its reference to the Home Affairs Committee.2.   The main provisions of the Bill relate to the following matters : (a) an extension of the powers to enter into subsidy agreements at present provided in the Air Transport (Subsidy Agreements) Act, 1930, in view of the enlarged schemes for Imperial Air Communications and of other Oversea air developments;(b) the delegation from the Air Ministry, to a body representative of civilaviation interests, of administrative functions in regard to the design, construction and maintenance of civil aircraft;(c) the introduction of a system of compulsory insurance against third partydamage caused by aircraft flying in this country to persons and property on the ground;(d) the limitation of third part)&apos; liability of aircraft owners as a feature ofthat system;(e) the taking of power to give effect by Order in Council to an international convention dealing with the two matters above, (c) and (d); (/) the transfer to the Secretary of State (as such) of functions as to civilaviation at present legally vested in the Air Council; (g) the taking of power to introduce a system of licensing of air transport services in so far as that may prove necessary.3. Opportunity is also being taken to place on a permanent basis the powers for compulsory acquisition of land for aerodrome purposes now available to local authorities under the temporary provisions of the Public Works Facilities Act, 1930, thus avoiding the recurrent use of the Expiring Laws Continuation Bill, and to make a number of miscellaneous alterations and additions to the existing statutory provisions for air navigation which experience shows to be required.4. The final drafting of the Bill had been unavoidably deferred, principally to enable it to include matters arising out of the recommendations of the Report of Lord GorelFs Committee (1934), some of which have necessitated lengthy discussions with other Government Departments and outside interests. The main recommendations of that Committee (including items (b), (c) and (d) above) were brought to the notice of the Cabinet by my predecessor in CP. 178 (34), dated the 5th July, 1934, when attention was drawn to the need for subsequent legislation. The decisions of the Government and of the Secretary of State on these recommendations were thereafter announced in the Secretary of State&apos;s Memorandum prefaced to the Report when that Report was presented to Parliament.[12385]
5. Civil aviation has made great advances since the last Act in 1920, and some of the changes in the present Bill are much overdue; it is therefore very desirable that the Bill should now be introduced without further delay!&quot;&quot; 6.; I have considered whether the Bill could be introduced in the Lords. I am advised that this is technically practicable, but would entail the italicising of certain key clauses, in particular the clause providing for civil aviation subsidies over the next 15 years. I think my colleagues will agree that, in the circumstances, it is politically expedient to introduce the Bill in the House of Commons.7.   The drafting of the Bill is practically complete.P. C.-L.November 25, 1935.
