As regards Proposal (l),  the provisions of the Order-in-Council would come into force immediately upon issue;      and the Order would state that the provisions relating to Proposals (2),   (3) and (4) would come into force at a date to be fixed by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom,, As regards Proposal (2),  it is suggestedthat the provisions of the Order-in-Council should be brought
into force by His Majesty&apos;s Government at a date, as early as possible and in no case later than 31st October, 1935, to be agreed upon with the other Governments particularly concerned, i.e0 the French, Netherlands and Swiss Governments,The date by which His Majesty&apos;s Government will be able to bring proposals (3)  and (4) into operation must be notified to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations not later than 28th October, 1935.    Once the relevant Order or Orders-in-Gouncil have been passed, notice of seven days (or, subject to consultation with the Board of Customs, possibly less) would be necessary before His Majesty&apos;s Government could make the necessary arrangements to bring the measures into force.    This would enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to give an adequate notifica- &apos; tion to the Secretary-General of the League0The Order will apply to the Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories as well as to the United Kingdom, and although it will be difficult to bring it into force simultaneously in the more remote dependencies, it is not thought that these difficulties will be insuperable.In regard to Proposal (5) no action is at present required on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government,,    The Foreign Office, the Treasury and the Board of Trade are agreed that this Proposal, as it stands, places no Immediate or specific obligation on His Majesty&apos;s Government to fulfil their commitment to mutual support embodied in Article 16 (3) of the Covenant.    The Departments will, however, examine what action it might be possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to take in connexion with this proposal,  should other Governments press for it.SIGN OFFICE 322nd October, 1935.
