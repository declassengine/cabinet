THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CABINET.GROWN LANDS BILL.Memorandum by; the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries. [Commissioner (ex-officio) of Crown Lands.]This Memorandum is submitted for the purpose of seeking the approval of the Cabinet for the introduction of a Crown Lands Bill at an early date.It is proposed by the Office of Works to erect on a site adjoining Richmond Terrace in Whitehall an extension of the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police in Scotland Yard, which is urgently needed.     The only reason why legislation is necessary for this purpose is because the interests of the Westminster City Council over the roadway and mews and of the Crown Estate Paving Commissioners over the Gardens, are involved, and accordingly it is proposed in the Bill to do away with the interests of both these bodies so that the site can be built upon.     The site is vested at the moment in the King in right of His Grown, and it is intended that the property shall eventually he conveyed by the Commissioners of Crown Lands to the Commissioners of Works or the Receiver for the Metropolitan Police District in exchange for a payment to be by way of annuity.The extinction of the interests of the Westminster City Council and the Paving Commissioners is also necessary to enable the Commissioners of Crown Lands to convey to the Commissioners of Works the site of Montagu House and Richmond Terrace in the event of building schemes for the development of these sites being approved by the Cabinet in due course.     A specific scheme for the development of the Whitehall Gardens, Montagu House site will, I understand, be submitted to the Cabinet at a very early date.
It is also desired to take the opportunity to regularise certain transfers of the management of portions of Regent&apos;s Park from the Commissioners of Crown Lands to the Commissioners of Works.     These transfers have, in fact, been made with the approval of the Cabinet in the past, and it is now desired to give the Commissioners of Crown Lands power to make such transfers by amending the Crown. Lands Acts.It is also proposed to include in the Bill various minor amendments of the Crown Lands Acts which have been found desirable.^ and it may be necessary to make provision to enable the Forestry. Commissioners to borrow from the Commissioners of Crown Lands for capital purposes0     This matter has not however yet been settled,,I will shortly submit to my colleagues a draft Bill setting out precisely what is intended to be done, but in the meantime I shall be glad to have the authority of the Cabinet to proceed with such a Bill ast private interests being involved it is necessary for Notices of the Bill to be issued in the London Gazette before the 10th December, 1935,.-The Bill will be non-contentious- and a hybrid Bill.(Intlde)    W.S.L.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. 29th November, 19350
