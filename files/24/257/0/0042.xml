THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  December 1935.MOST SECRET. Copy No.  45CP. 222 (35).CABINET.THE ATLANTIC AIR ROUTE.Joint Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary ofState for Air.1. IN paragraphs (1) to (7) of the Memorandum CP. 164 (35) the attention of the Cabinet was drawn to certain fundamental aspects of the problem of establishing a Trans-Atlantic air service, and reference was made to the intention that a delegation from this country should visit Canada and the U.S.A. to carry out preliminary negotiations, with a view to coming to agreement as to the operation of a service.2. Such a delegation, comprising the Director-General of the Post Office, the Director-General of Civil Aviation and the Managing Director of Imperial Airways, Limited, has been in conference at Ottawa during the past ten days with representatives of the Canadian, Newfoundland and Irish Free State Governments. The Ottawa discussions have now concluded and the United Kingdom, Canadian and Irish Free State Delegations are proceeding to Washington for a further conference with representatives of the Government of the United States.3. Certain proposals were formulated in Ottawa to serve as the basis of an agreement between the United Kingdom, Canadian and Irish Free State Delegations, whereby they might present a united front in the discussions at Washington. It is clearly of the utmost importance that there should be no possibility of one Commonwealth Government being played off against another.4. These proposals were considered at the draft stage by the Inter-Departmental Committee on International Air Communications, under the Chairmanship of Sir Warren Fisher, and telephonic contact was established with the United Kingdom delegation. In the light of their representations and subject to the elucidation of certain difficulties of detail, they were authorised, with the approval of the Secretary of State for Air, to conclude an agreement on the lines suggested, on the understanding that it would be subject to the final approval of the several Governments concerned.5. A report on the position by Sir Warren Fisher&apos;s Committee is appended to this paper, and, in the light of the observations set out therein, we now seek Cabinet approval for the endorsement of the provisional agreement reached in Ottawa. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the Postmaster-General have intimated their general concurrence. It appears desirable that the United Kingdom Delegation should be able to pursue their discussions at Washington in knowledge that the Ottawa agreement has been approved.N. C.

-(Secret.)INTER-DEPARTMENTAL  COMMITTEE  ON  INTERNATIONAL  air communications.Report on Proposed Commonwealth Agreement for an Atlantic AirService.To the Secretary of State for Air.1. Very real progress appears to have been made in the negotiations at Ottawa between the Delegations from the United Kingdom, Canada, Newfound-land and the Irish Free State for the promotion of a joint North Atlantic air service. With your approval, and following a careful review by this Committee of the proposals when still in draft form, the United Kingdom Delegation has been authorised to conclude a provisional agreement with the other delegations subject to the final approval of the several Governments.2. The question was raised with the Delegation as to whether it would not suffice to limit immediate action to the formulation of agreed conclusions which all parties would undertake to recommend for acceptance by their respective Governments, but it was represented strongly that the Canadian and Irish delegations attached so great importance to the conclusion of a more formal basis of agreement that anything less than the signature of a definite agreement, subject only to the final approval of the respective Governments, would imperil the chances of a successful outcome to the negotiations and preclude the possibility of a common Anglo-Irish-Canadian front in the negotiations impending this week with the United States Government. In deference to these representations and on the recommendation of my Committee, you authorised the Delegation to proceed on this basis, and they were also informed that you contemplated referring the matter immediately to the Cabinet with a view to seeking approval of the provisional agreement. This report has accordingly been prepared in order that such reference may be made.3. The details of the provisional agreement are indicated in the following summary :j (i) It is agreed that the Governments of the United Kingdom, Canada,Newfoundland, and the Irish Free State will co-operate in the develop-ment of a joint North Atlantic air service for the carriage of mails, passengers and freight.(ii) It is the common intention to organise the service so as to permit ofthe carriage of all Empire first-class mail by air over this route at the earliest possible date compatible with financial and technical considerations. In the meantime, air mails will be carried on a surcharge basis, whilst passenger-carrying aircraft will be employed as soon as may be practicable.(lii) A common policy will be pursued by all the Governments in the fixing of surcharge rates to regulate the carriage of air mails.(iv) The United Kingdom Government will, through the agency of Imperial Airways (Limited), undertake technical and financial responsibility for the preliminary survey flights and experimental service necessary to establish the practicability of a regular service. The preliminary survey flights are planned for the summer of 1936, to be followed by an experimental service as soon as possible. It is highly desirable that control of the preliminary developments should remain in this country, and it does not, therefore, appear unreasonable for the United Kingdom to undertake this responsibility, especially as Imperial Airways will have a controlling interest in the organisation to be set up for the regular service, and will receive a reasonable management-fee assessed with due regard inter alia to the value of that Company&apos;s preparatory work and accumulated experience; it has been expressly stipulated that the stage at which and the method by which the management-fee shall be settled must be reserved for consideration on the return of the United Kingdom Delegation. Moreover, the United Kingdom Government must inevitably, as the predominant partner in
the enterprise, undertake the responsibility for establishing the practicability of the service a responsibility which cam only be truly fulfilled if entrusted to one party alone, having regard to the time factor and the keen competitive efforts of other countries to establish Trans-Atlantic services. The preparatory work which has already been done by this country and the steps which have been taken towards the provision of equipment and the training of personnel place Iznperial Airways in an exceptional position for undertaking this responsibility : no other Commonwealth organisation is in a position to undertake the work with an equal chance of success. It is difficult to formulate any reliable estimate of the probable cost of such a pre-liminary stage, but it is thought that the total expenditure, likely to fall upon the United Kingdom Government before the practicability of a regular service has been established, should not exceed  60,000.(v) As soon as it has been established that a regular service is technicallypracticable- (without, however, implying any necessity for a regular service to have been actually initiated), a joint Anglo-Irish-Canadian operating company will take over the equipment in being or on order for the service and will assume the responsibility for its inauguration and development. By &quot; practicability of a regular service&quot; is meant the possibility of operating two Commonwealth services each way per week over a minimum period of three months&apos; continuous flying. By this arrangement, the joint company will assume responsibility as soon as the practicability of a summer service is demonstrated. It should be added that the negotiations impending at Washington are designed to secure full co-operation between this joint company and Pan-American Airways, whereby each will operate two services each way per week so as to ensure a full regular service of four services each way per week.(vi) All practicable preference will be given to the development of the airservice over the direct route via Newfoundland and Ireland so as to promote the Empire aspects of the service and, at the same time, establish its supremacy over foreign services operating over the longer route, via the Azores and Bermuda. It is probable, however, that it will be necessary during the early years to operate the service during the winter months over the Azores-Bermuda route, having regard to the adverse weather conditions on the direct route.(vii) The share capital of the joint company would be held as to 51 percent, by Imperial Airways, whilst the national aviation companies of Canada and Ireland would each hold not exceeding 24^ per cent. Full safeguards will be taken to ensure that Imperial Airways retain commercial, technical and operational control, both through their stock-holding majority and through the joint company&apos;s articles of association. Special provision has also been contemplated to prevent sales of stock without the consent of the board of the joint company and to ensure that its board meetings will be held in London. A further reservation has been made to the effect that the holding of the Irish Free State should not.exceed 24^ per cent, and that, if Canada does not take up her full 24-^ per cent, any balance should revert to the United Kingdom for allocation as may be decided. If this latter contingency should mature, due regard would be had to the claims of Newfoundland or to the desirability of securing the interest of the shipping companies in the new company.(viii) The board of the joint company would comprise nine directors, threefrom each of the participating national companies, the chairman and managing director being drawn from the Imperial Airways represen-tation. Suitable procedure is proposed to regulate the relationship of the board to Imperial Airways as its operational managers and also to ensure against undesirable nominations to the board. Special consideration was given to the possibility of giving Imperial Airways a larger number of directorships, but the proposal was dropped when it became evident that insistence on the point would wreck the negotia-1 tions. - Moreover, the&apos; proposed organisation is fully adequate to give that company effective control [12414] B 2
(ix) An inter-governmental committee, comprising representatives of the fourCommonwealth Governments concerned, would be established to facilitate working arrangements between the joint company and the several Governments. The definition of its functions will be subject to careful consideration in due course so as to guard against any undue development of its activities.(x) Canada has undertaken to contribute 20 per cent., within a maximum of  TSjOOO per annum, of the subsidy necessary for the regular service and has, moreover, agreed to provide her own ground organisation and the meteorological and radio services in Newfoundland both for the experimental period and for the regular service. These services in Newfoundland are estimated at  6,000 per annum and Canada&apos;s total contribution will thus exceed the minimum figure which the United Kingdom Delegation was authorised to consider, viz.,  70,000 or 21-^ per cent, on an estimated total subsidy of  325,000. The Canadian Delegation have under-taken to give safeguards for any future Dominion rights of New-foundland, whilst the position appears to be further ensured by the fact that it is proposed that the United Kingdom shall assume responsibility for the air bases required in Newfoundland. The contribution of Newfoundland is proposed as a fixed payment of  5,000 per annum a sum which seems highly reasonable having regard to the small volume of mail emanating from that country.(xi) The contribution of the Irish Free State remains to be determined afterthe return of the United Kingdom Delegation to this country, it will possibly take the form of a fixed payment, but its determination has been reserved in order to avoid an awkward situation in the Ottawa discussions. Canada agreed, however, that the assessment of the Irish contribution on a lower basis than her own would not invalidate her agreed percentage.(xii) The extent of the Irish Free State&apos;s stock holding in the joint company and her share of the directorships are mutually understood to be subject to a satisfactory outcome of the subsequent negotiations as to her subsidy contribution.(xiii) The financial arrangements are framed to continue over a period of fifteen years or until it is possible to send all Empire first-class mail by air, whichever is the earlier. It is proposed also to include provision for triennial revisions of the subsidy payments made to the joint company, on the lines contemplated for the Empire Air Mail Scheme. Similarly, all Governments will be expected to grant exemption from fuel, oil and other materiel taxation and the granting of corresponding exemptions to Pan-American Airways will be conditional upon reciprocity, whilst the greater benefit to be derived by the American company will be used as a factor in negotiations with the United States Government for complete co-operation.(xiv) The landing rights at the several Commonwealth air bases would be exclusive to the joint company as against foreign companies, except by mutual consent of the partner Governments. It is hoped to secure full American co-operation by judicious use of this situation before such landing rights are extended to Pan-American Airways, whilst it should be practicable at the same time to prevent other foreign companies operating over the direct route via Ireland and New-foundland.(xv) The question of the financing of the base in Ireland was not raised at Ottawa, in view of the difficulties which the subject entails. It will be a matter for elucidation during the course of the subsidy negotia-tions when the delegation returns. The question is fully discussed in paragraphs (8) to (14) of the Memorandum CP. 164 (35). (xvi) Similarly, the Ottawa discussions have not determined the extent to which the several Commonwealth Governments will co-operate in bearing any share of the cost of ground organisation necessary in the Azores. The negotiations in Washington will embrace the question of securing British, American and French co-operation in financing the base in those islands, and the matter appears to be one which must stand over until the results of these discussions are known.
4. The provisional agreement, as summarised above, is considered by my Committee to be a satisfactory basis for co-operation between the four Common-wealth Governments in a joint endeavour to promote a Trans-Atlantic Service which will maintain British prestige in the face of foreign competition. As indicated in paragraph (7) of the Memorandum CP. 164 (35), the U.S.A. controls the routing of some 85 per cent, of the mails going eastwards across the North Atlantic, and it is, therefore, essential to come to some arrangement for full co-operation between the American and British operating companies. It is hoped that the provisional agreement reached in Ottawa will enable the Commonwealth delegations to present such a united front at Washington that they may be able to bring the negotiations with the U.S.A. Government to an entirely satisfactory issue by virtue of the geographical assets possessed by the Commonwealth Governments at Bermuda and on the direct route via Newfoundland and Ireland.5. My Committee accordingly recommend the Ottawa agreement for final approval as an essential step towards the success of the Washington negotiations. It would be a very real advantage to the United Kingdom delegation if they could enter upon those negotiations with the knowledge that the Ottawa agreement is approved by the Government.6. It appears necessary, however, to observe that the implementation of the Ottawa Agreement will be subject to the negotiation of suitable arrangements with the Board of Imperial Airways. The general principles of the agreement have been informally concurred in by the Chairman of that Company in London, whilst the Managing Director is a member of the United Kingdom delegation. It is not to be apprehended, therefore, that any difficulties will arise in carrying through those negotiations, but it is necessary to reserve the Board&apos;s position. There remain, moreover, financial problems to be determined by negotiation with that Board, such as the measure of their management-fee and the conditions of transfer to the new company of technical equipment in being or on order. These points must necessarily stand over for later determination.7. Mention should perhaps be made of the fact that the details of the report of the Imperial Committee on the Trans-Atlantic Air Service, which sat during the Ottawa Conference, 1932, are given in the Memorandum CP. 182 (35). Reference may be desired to those earlier discussions.N. F. WARREN FISHER, Chairman, Inter-departmental Committee on International Air Communications.December 2, 1935.
