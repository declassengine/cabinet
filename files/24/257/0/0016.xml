Unexpected difficulties arose in the application of these regulations? and at their Meeting on 5th February? 1935 (Cabinet 8 (35) Conclusion 6) the Cabinet agreed -(a) To thank&quot; the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Labour for the responsibility they had taken and to give them full supper t (b) That the Cabinet Committee on the Draft Regulations of the Unemployment Assistance Board,  which had been revived at their previous Meeting, should be kept in existence;(c) To take note that the Minister of Labour might find it necessary to propose to his colleagues big changes in the present scheme;(d) That the new scales ought to ensure -(i) that account is taken of theconditions all over the country; and(ii) that the allowances are adequate to meet requirements.sjSJ^R E T, P..P. 196 (35).-1-
30 The Unemployment Assistance (Temporary Provisions)Act, 1935,   which received the Royal Assent, on 15th February last, provided, inter alia, for a &quot;standstill&quot; under which allowances payable to tie farmer &quot;transitional payments&quot; class are not to be less than the transitional payments which would have been payable to them under the former scheme.4D On the reconstruction of the Government in June last,the membership of the Cabinet Committee was altered(in pursuance of C0P0  121 (35)) and is now as follows  :-The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Chairman)o The Home Secretary,,The Secretary of State fur Dominion Affairs. The Secretary of State for Scotland. The Minister without Portfolio-The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,. - The President of the Board of Educatioru The Minister of Health, The Minister of Labour0 The First Commissioner of Works.5C The Minister of Labour has,  in the meantime, been engaged,  in collaboration with the Unemployment assistance board,  in a detailed investigation into the whole problem.He&apos; has had the benefit of a Memorandum submitted by the board in May last,  in which the working of the existing Regulationsis described and proposals are made for their amendment.      TheMinister has informed us, however,  that he had not completedhis examination0      It has, nevertheless, been sufficient to convince him that it will not be possible to substitute new regulations for the &quot;standstill&quot; arrangements at any date inthe near future.      His view is that any approach to the problemmust be gradual and must take account of the following factors;-(i) The continuance cf the Unemployment Assistance Board is vital to the Government&apos;s prestige.(ii) A complete uniform scale cannot be imposed immediately throughout the country.(iii) It is necessary to have regard to previous  local practice,  and to secure the approval of local opinion.
63 In the existing situation, a ruling is required, asa matter of urgency, on four points :-(a) The line to he taken during the debate on the adjournment.(b) The line to be taken in the Governments General Election Programme regarding the future of Unemployment Assistance.(c) The answers to be given by Government candidates in the constituencies when questioned regarding the Means Testu(d) A particular problem raised by a Report received in July last from the Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee.We attempt in the following paragraphs to indicate briefly our recommendations on these four matters0 The line to be taken during the debate on the Adjournment.70 The greater part of the time allotted for the debate will, no doubt, .&apos;be devoted to foreign affairs. It is expected that not more than half a day will be available for the discussion of domestic problems, among which may be included the problem of the Special Areas, as well as that of Unemployment Assistance. 80 We consider that any reply on behalf of HisMajesty&apos;s Government as to future policy on Unemployment Assistance should be confined to a minimum.      It would be undesirable, as a matter of tactics,  to use in debate any statement intended for the General Election programmes&quot;, in view of the indefinite character which such a statement must in the present circumstances assume. 9. It will accordingly be desirable,  if practicable,to reply simply to the effect that it is not possible ta^take any action immediately and that it is not anticipated that any alteration can be made in the existing position of the Standstill&quot;arrangements before next spring at the earliest;    out the circumstances af the debate may make it necessary to give some general indication of future policy,  on the lines of (i),  (ii) and (iii) in paragraph 5 above.
S3The line to be taken ^in the Government1 s Greneral Election   QJgHSJMg-fJE&amp;dkiJl S /the future of Unemployment.. Asslstancej..10.      We append to the present Report a draft Statement(Appendix A) 9 which we recommend should he incorporated inthe Government&apos;s Programme.      The Statement has been drafted in agreement with the Unemployment -Assistance Board on bread and general lines.      It endeavours to emphasise the followingpoint s;-The existing powers of the Unemployment -Assistance board, and the general framework of the Unemploy-ment Assistance Act, will be continued.The &quot;standstill&apos;&apos;&apos; is not to be a lasting -feature, and permanent arrangements will take its place.There will be full association with local opinion,, so that effect can be given to reasonable differences in the localities.Work is still to be done and new arrangements are contemplatedy but they will not come into operation before next spring at the earliest.The answers to be given , by^^jjovernment.....candidates in the constituencies when.....questioned regarding., the Means ^Test.,11.      It is necessary in our view that definite guidanceshould be given to candidates.      The points at issue aretechnical and candidates might otherwise be in difficultyin answering questions.12.      we recommend the adoption of a form of words (Appendix B).      Candidates shoulds in our opinion, be strongly urged not to go beyond its terms.Particular problems raised by a Report received by the Minister.,, of ^Labour in July last from the Unemployment Insurance Statutory CommitteenReactions on, Unemployment As si st axice 13.      The principle involved in the question came under the consideration of the Cabinet at its meeting on 16th October (Cabinet 47(35.) 5 Conclusion 9).      The Report was rendered by Sir William Beveridge&apos;s Committee in pursuance of the statutory duty placed on them by Section 59 of the Unemploy-ment Insurance Act. 1935.      The Committee have formally reported thatt-
(l) The Unemployment Fund is, and is likely to continue to bes more than reasonably sufficient to discharge its liabilities;(2) A change is required to make the fund no more than reasonably sufficients and it is recommended that the benefit in respect of dependent children should be 5s.  in place of 2s.  a week, subject to the proviso that the total benefit to any claimant should not exceed a certain limit? for which 41s. a week is suggested.(3)  It is estimated that this recommendation will increase the expenditure of the fund by approximately  1^50.000 a year.14.      The Act provides that within the period of two months after the receipt by the Minister of Labour of such a Report3 or3 if Parliament is not sitting at the expiration of that period, then as soon after the expiration thereof as Parliament sits, the Minister must lay the Report before Parliament.      He must also lay the draft of an order carrying out the Statutory Committee&apos;s recommendationss or making such amendments as will have substantially the same financial effect.      If he departs from the Committee&apos;s recommendationss he must also lay before Parliament a statement of the reasons for the difference.      The draft order requires the approval of both Houses. 15.      The Law Officers have advised that the Minister is obliged to lay the Report and the draft order before Par-liament on Tuesday9 22nd October.      It is not obligatory when laying the draft order to insert the date on which the order shall come into operation, if approved^ but any delay must not be beyond what is reasonably required for administrative purposes.16.      Under existing legislation, a decision to increase the   rate    of   unemployment    benefit   for    dependent children   would   have   reactions    upon   the    expenditure
V5on imemploymeiit assistance.      The Committee had before them a statement &quot;by the Unemployment Assistance Board upon the subject (Appendix c).1.7. To apply the increased rate of dependants benefit for children to the calculation of supplementary allowances under the &quot;standstill&quot; would in our opinion produce a result which was never intended and which could not reasonably be claimed by applicants..      The increased rates only arise out of the improved financial position of the Unemployment Insurance Fund and have &quot;been recommended by Sir William Beveridge*s Committee without reference to Unemployment Assistance.      We have therefore invited the Minister of Labour to consult again with the Unemployment Assistance Board as to the necessity for applying the new rates to the calculation of payments under the &quot;standstill&quot;. Suggesited over-all,limit to oenefit.18. We have given a good deal of consideration to the proviso suggested by the Committee, which would impose a limit of 41s.  to the amount of benefit that may &quot;be drawn by a claimanto        This raises issues of far-reaching importance, which ought to be discussed adequately on some appropriate occasion;      It appears to us to be a change which ought not to be made as part of the present proposal.      We therefore think that the proviso should be omitted from the draft order, and that in giving reasons (as he is bound under the law to do) for this departure from the Committee&apos;s recommendations the Minister should base himself on the considerations we have just mentioned,,We attach (Appendix D) the draft of a statement on the lines which we recommend.
Our conclusions and recommendations on the four points set out in paragraph 6 may be summarised as follows:-(a) The line to be taken during the debate on the adjournment should,  if placticable, be to the effect that it is not possible to take any action immediately and that it is not anticipated that any alteration can be made in the existing position of the &quot;standstill&quot; arrangements before next spring at the earliest;    but the circumstances of the debate may make it necessary to give some genera], indication of future policy, on the lines of (i),   (ii) and (iii) in paragraph 5 above.(b) The line to be taken in the Government1s General Election Programme regarding the future of Unemployment Assistance should be as in Appendix A to the present Report;(c) Government candidates in the constituencies when questioned regarding the Means Test, should be strongly advised to confine themselves to the form of words set out in Appendix B to the present Report.(d) A draft order increasing the rate of Unemployment Benefit for dependent children from 2s.  to 5s, with effect from the 51st October should be laid before Parliament on Tuesday, 22nd October, hut the proviso in the Statutory Committee &apos;s recommendation imposing a limit to the amount of benefit that may be drawn by a claimant should be omitted from the order, in w&apos;.ew of the lack of Parliamentary time for adequate discussj on.The Minister of Labour should be invited to consult again with the Unemployment Assistance Board as to  the necessity for applying the increased rates to the calculation of payments under the &quot;standstill&quot;.Care should be taken,  in any statement or answer to questions, not to imply that the increases will necessarily apply to payments under the &quot;standstill&quot;.Signed on behalf of the Committee,N*   CHAMBERLAIN.Chairman.S Whitehall Gardens,  S.V.i Octoner,1935.
The position arising from what are commonly known as the Standstill arrangements under the Unemployment Assistance Scheme has received and is still receiving anxious and prolonged consideration &quot;by the Unemployment Assistance Board and the Ministry of Labour.      Any measures that maty be proposed will require the approval of Parliament; which must have full opportunity to examine them in detail.      It is not possible therefore to  take action during the present Session, but I am in a position to inform the House in general terms of the decisions which the Government have reached.The Government regard it as important to maintain the existing powers of the Unemployment Assistance Board and the general framework of the Unemployment Assistance Act,      They will, however,  give effect to any recommendations by the Board for improved arrangements where these may be shewn by experience to be desirable.The Standstill arrangements are as they were always intended to be,  temporary.      They must be replaced by permanent arrangements which must remedy certain abuses and at  the same time avoid hardship to applicants.      Any action on these lines will only be gradual and will be carried out by the Board in full association with local opinion,  so that effect can be given to reasonable differences in the localities.In view of the considerable amount of work still to be done before the new arrangements can be put into operation it will not be possible to make any alteration in the existing position of the Standstill before next spring at the earliest.
APPENDIX B. THE MEANS TEST.No responsible person would seriously suggest that unemployment assistance, which is not insurance benefit, ought to be paid without regard to the resources properly available to the applicant0      The question is not whether there should be a means test but what that test should bea This is a matter upon which the working of the Unemployment Assistance Scheme has thrown much light and It is now under close examination by the Unemployment Assistance Board and the Government.If there are cases of proved hardship they will be met and nothing will be done that could fairly be alleged to break up family life*
NOTE BY UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE BOARD.SUPPLEMENTARY ALLOWANCES AND THE INCREASE IN&apos;. THE CHILDREN ? S RATE .1. The effect of an increase from 2/- to &apos;6/- in the rate ofunemployment benefit for dependent children would be to increase to a corresponding extent the maximum payments by way of supplementary allowances under the Temporary Provisions Act, - the &quot;Standstill&apos;&apos; Act,    Under that Act it is necessary to determine the amount which would have been payable by way of transitional payments, and the excess, if any, of that amount over the amount assessed under the Board&apos;s Regulations is the amount of the supplementary allowance. 2. The increase in the benefit rate for children cannotlegally produce an increase in the allowances payable under the &quot;Standstill&quot; unless the Local Authority has adopted or adopts In future for its own relief purposes rates at least as high as the increased benefit rates.    It may be assumed that in a large number of areas the Local Authorities will in fact do this, and In accordance with the &quot;Standstill&quot; the allowance in appropriate cases will be increased.In other areas where the Local Authority has been paying transitional payments at the maximum rates although its own relief rates are not so high, there may be some demand that the extra shilling shall be paid in respect of the children in households receiving allowances under the &quot;Standstill&quot;.    This would, however, be a further extension of the illegal departures from the out-relief basis, and the Board, therefore, propose, subject to my concurrence, to instruct their officers that in applying the &quot;Standstill&quot; Act they should follow what the Local Authorities do in respect of rates of out-relief.
APPENDIX... .D,(INCREASE OF BENEFIT IN RESPECT OP DEPENDENT CHILDREN) ORDER.  19550Statement by the Minister of Labour in accordance with Section 59(4) (b) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1935.*-II&apos; :,\&apos;v. --vt-di &apos;ii:-/.      - &apos;      : -In their Report of 4th July, 1935, the Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee have reported that the Unemployment Fund is and is likely to continue to be more than reasonably sufficient to discharge its liabilities and have recommended that, in order to make the Fund no more than reasonably sufficient for this purpose, the additional benefit payable in respect of dependent children should be increased from 2/- to 3/- a week, subject to the proviso that the total benefit to any claimant should not exceed a certain limit for which they suggest 41/- a week.      This change would, the Committee estimate, increase the expenditure of the Fund by approximately  1,S50P000 a yearaThe draft order gives effect to the Statutory Committee&apos;s recommendation, except that it does not include the suggested provisos      The Committee state in their Report that the limit which they suggest should not be regarded as affecting directly the financial condition of the Unemployment Fundo
