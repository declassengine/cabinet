THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1935.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.CP. 238 (35).CABINET.&quot;STATUS QUO&quot; IN THE PACIFIC: AETICLE 19 OF THE WASHINGTON TREATY.Memorandum by the Minister for League of Nations Affairs.IN accordance with the decision of the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements on the 6th December, I circulate to my colleagues herewith an appreciation of the political considerations involved in the retention or otherwise of Article 19 of the Washington Treaty.A. E.December 7, 1935.Article XIX of the Washington Treaty.In their memorandum of the 27th November, 1934 (circulated in D.P.R. 60) the Chiefs of Staff reach the conclusion that, from the strategical point of view, it would be to our advantage to be no longer bound by the provision in the Washington Treaty which maintains the status quo in regard to the fortifi-cation of certain insular possessions in the Pacific. They point out, however, that there are other matters outside the strategical field which wall have a material bearing on the ultimate decision as to the retention or otherwise of this article in any agreement that may be reached.It may be mentioned at the outset that the fortification of the Japanese man-dated islands and the establishment of military and naval bases in them are forbidden by the terms of the mandate itself, which is of earlier date than the Washington Treaty. This prohibition would not be affected by the renewal or non-renewal of article 19 of the Washington Treaty, though non-renewal followed by further fortification of Hong Kong and American bases might strengthen Japanese desire to disregard the prohibition contained in the mandate, and it would be a difficult matter to enforce compliance or to take away the mandate.I. International Political Considerations.Amongst the other matters which must be considered are political considera-tions arising out of our relations with Japan. The Chiefs of Staff memorandum makes it clear that what is contemplated is a &quot;first-class naval base.&quot; While the Chiefs of Staff memorandum does not say that any half-measures in this matter of fortification would not greatly help our strategical position in these regions,, this conclusion seems to follow from the general arguments contained in the memorandum.8228   [12440]
What is therefore likely to be the effect on Japan if we decide to turn Hong Kong into a first-class naval base ? At the worst Japan might decide that it is best to strike while we are still weak in the Pacific and the capture of Hong Kong is a relatively simple matter. Again Japan might, in her present temper, decide to seize or &quot; lease &quot; certain territory for an air base on the mainland of China and so greatly increase the difficulty of defending Hong Kong against air attack. While neither of these alternatives can be regarded as likely courses for Japan to take, they should not be dismissed out of hand as impossible. Thirdly, Japan might take no offensive action of any kind, but might nevertheless regard our action in creating a first-class base at Hong Kong as something even more dangerous for Japan than our activities at Singapore and as evidence of definitely hostile intentions on our part. A change for the worse in our relations with Japan would necessarily follow. The development of Singapore as a naval base has all along been distasteful to the Japanese, whose feelings would no doubt have been stronger if the progress made had been faster. A similar development so much nearer home as Hong Kong would certainly be resented in a much more lively manner. Much the same result would follow from a less ambitious but still considerable strengthening of Hong Kong, while the countervailing benefit would be materially less.It is not suggested that these possibilities should, in themselves, deter us from fortifying Hong Kong, because, if we are to retain our position as a Great Power in the Pacific, we must be prepared to run risks and to take all steps we think fit for the defence of our territories. Nevertheless, this political aspect of the question should be given full weight in reaching a final decision as to the retention or otherwise of the provisions of article XIX of the Washington Treaty, and this is particularly the case at a time when the preservation of good relations is considered to be an object of great importance. ;II. Considerations of Domestic Policy.The fact that the Washington Treaty contains a provision limiting the fortification of certain possessions in the Pacific is well known to the general public here and is regarded in many quarters as one of the most useful provisions of that Treaty. Were His Majesty&apos;s Government either to take the lead in abandoning this provision or even to make no effort to maintain it, a certain amount of public criticism must be expected, even though our case on strategical grounds may be strong.III. Use of Article XIX as a bargaining counter with the Japanese Delegates.Such indications as we have, whether direct from the Japanese or from secret sources, do not indicate any strong Japanese desire to retain this provision of the Treaty. Indeed, there is some reason to believe, from the wording of Japanese communications to us, as subsequently illustrated by Japanese press comment, that Japan would only wish to renew this provision if the area under consideration were to be modified in a sense favourable to Japan. It also seems possible that the development of the air-arm may have contributed to a change of view on the part of the Japanese Government since 1922. While, therefore, there is force in the Chiefs of Staff contention that we should endeavour to obtain some quid pro quo from Japan in other directions for the retention of Article XIX, it would be unwise to set too much store on the efficacy of this bargaining counter.Conclusion.      *If the above political considerations are held to have some weight, then our best course may perhaps be as follows :-(1) At the appropriate moment, express readiness to prolong this provision of the Washington Treaty, subject only to such modifications as may be necessary to bring it up to date in view of the development of the requirements of air defence since 1922.
(2) If Japan demands modifications unacceptable to us, they can be rejected with the knowledge that we shall not much mind if Article XIX disappears. If Japan proves intractable, she must take the blame for the non-renewal of the Article.(3) In any case, ascertain the views of the United States Delegation (who may have new instructions) before a definite decision is taken that it would be in our general interest, from a political as well as from a strategical point of view, to allow these dispositions of the Washington Treaty to disappear.Foreign Office, December, 1935.
