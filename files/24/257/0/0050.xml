3-4 A 10(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) .1.     A Bill to establish, a municipal midwifery service in England and Wales was approved in.principle by the Cabinet on consideration of the King&apos;s Speech (Cabinet 49(35), Conclusion 5), which contained a reference to it, and was included in the list of Bills submitted by the Home Affairs Committee and approved by the Cabinet (Cabinet 51(35), Conclusion 4).      I desire to lay before my colleagues for their approval some further details of the proposed legislation..2.     The Bill will in the main follow certain recommendations made by a special Committee appointed by the Joint Council of Midwifery, a voluntary body of which the Earl of Athlone is Chairman.     The Committee contained representatives of all the Associations of doctors, midwives and nurses who are concerned with midwifery, and included a representative Town Clerk, and Clerk of a County Council.     The main feature of the Committee&apos;s Report, which was approved by the Joint Council, was a recommendation that each local supervising authority under the Midwives&apos; Acts (normally the County Council or the County Borough Council)  should be required to provide or secure the provision of .an adequate domiciliary service of midwives either by themselves employing the requisite number of whole-time midwives or by assisting voluntary organisations which employ salaried midwives in the area.3.      The principal provisions of the proposed Bill would be as follows:-(i)      Each local supervising authority would be requiredSECRET .COPY NO .CP. 230  (55)CABINET.ESTABLISHMENT OF MUNICIPAL MIDWIFERY SERVICE.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.to submit for the approval of the Minister a schemefor securing an adequate midwifery service.The
midwives in this service would act both as midwives and as non-resident maternity nurses for patients who employ the services of doctors.      The scheme would be prepared after consultation with the voluntary midwifery agencies in the area, with bodies representing doctors and midwives, and with the independent maternity and child welfare authorities in the county, (ii)    Each local supervising authority would be required to fix charges for the services of their midwives and.to recover the whole or such part of the charge as the financial:      .....     ....   -..        .... . - .    . .... ..- ;     . .... .   .. . ,-. . -../&apos;.&apos;.&apos;.&apos;.&apos;.-:/circumstances of the patient or her husband or other person legally liable to maintain her,   justified, (iii)    As from the date on which a scheme comes into full .operation it would be unlawful for any person other than a qualified doctor or certified midwife to.attend for gain women in childbirth in the area.      This is intended to put a stop to the employment of &quot;handy women&quot;,  but a saving will be inserted to protect those maternity nurses who are not qualified midwives but have received certificates of obstetrical training in a hospital, (iv)    Every midwife practising in the area would have anopportunity of applying for  a salaried post.      Those who did not   apply or whose application was not  successful would have the option of continuing in private practice or of ceasing practice and surrendering their midwives1 certificates.      In the latter event they would .bo entitled - to receive compensation from the local supervising authority on the basis of three years&apos; purchase of the net annual value of their practices, (v)    Local supervising authorities would be enabled for a limited period to require a midwife to retire from practice on the ground of ill-health or advanced age on receiving compensation on the above basis.
m(vi)    As most of the midwives would be over the age of 30,those authoritios who have superannuation schemes would be enabled to add years to the actual period of service of a midwife in calculating   the amount of her superannuati on.(vii)    The Bill would include some minor amendments    of the Midwives&apos;  Acts,   and in particular would provide that practising midwives might be required to attend periodically a &quot;refresher course&quot;. 4.      The duties to be imposed by the Bill will involve the institution of a new public health service  and material additional expenditure,  and there will be a clear case under section 135 of the Local Government Act,  1929, for asking Parliament to provide increased contributions from the Exchequer.    I have already proposed to the Chancellor that to the block grant payable to  local authorities under the Act of 1929 for thj fixed grant period commencing on th-; 1st April,  1937,   (when,   it is thought,  the schemes for salaried midwives will begin to operate)  an annual sum be added equivalent to one-half of the estimated additional expenditure to be incurred under these schemes  (roughly estimated at  500,000)  and also for providing in respect of the financial year 1937-38 an ad hoc grant of 50 percent cent,  of the expenditure (possibly about  200,000)  incurred by the local authorities in paying compensation to midwives who elect to go out of practice or who are required to cease practice on grounds of age or ill-health.5.      I shall be glad to receive    authority to proceed with the preparation of a Bill and with any necessary discussion with representatives of local authorities and others concerned on the basis outlined above.(Intld. ) K.W.6th December,  1935.
