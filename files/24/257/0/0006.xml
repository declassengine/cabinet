THE Cabinet, at a meeting held on Wednesday, the 2nd October, 1935 (Cabinet 44 (35), Conclusion 1), recorded the following Conclusions :  Ji. M. Jt, M.tt tv&quot; tv- -7v -yv-&quot; (c) That in the matter of economic and financial sanctions the Governments policy should be to advocate at Geneva the imposition of the maximum of economic sanctions on which agreement could be secured. It was recognised, however, that the amount of the sanctions would depend on the attitude of other nations, not only the States Members of the League, but also of non-Members, and on what might prove practicable as the result of international investigation.(d) That the Board of Trade should send an expert to join the UnitedKingdom Delegation at Geneva in order to advise the Minister for League of Nations Affairs on economic sanctions.(e) That the Advisory Committee on Trade Questions in Time of War should,as soon as possible, complete and present a Report on the forms of economic and financial sanctions applicable to the present crisis.&quot;*M. -Ai. M. Ji. M,&quot;TV1 -TV- W -TV&quot; -TPThe Advisory Committee on Trade Questions in Time of War consequently met the next day, the 3rd October, and agreed on the following Report as. provisional and subject to corrections and modifications. It is forwarded to the Cabinet in this provisional form in view of the possibility of early discussions at Geneva.2. Arms and Munitions.The Committee assume that the embargo on the export of arms and munitions to Italy will be continued.3. Financial Measures.Loans.-Although, in fact, Italy has no credit and cannot borrow abroad, it seems clear that, as a matter of principle, the States which are exerting pressure should prohibit loans to Italy. The prohibition should cover (i) loans publicly issued in the Member State concerned by the Italian Government or any insti-tution or firm in Italy; (ii) subscriptions on the part of any person in the Member State concerned to loams issued in Italy or any &quot; neutral &quot; State by the Italian[12181] b
government or any institution or firm in Italy; and (iii) banking or other credits (other than normal trade credits for permitted trade). Prohibition (i) could be rigidly enforced; prohibition (ii) and (iii) could be evaded, except in countries which have a strict exchange control or postal censorship. It is difficult to give any precise definition of &quot; normal trade credits,&quot; but in practice the British and French Banks, at any rate, could probably deal satisfactorily with individual applications for credit.Debts due to Italy and property of Italians.It would not be desirable to &apos;&apos; block &apos;&apos; or interfere in any way with bank balances, securities, or other property belonging to Italians or credit balances held by Italy under Clearing Agreements (except by way of reprisal for similar action on Italy&apos;s part). Such measures would do comparatively little harm to Italy, even if effectively applied, and they could easily be evaded in the absence of a strict exchange control or censorship. They would, on the other hand, gravely interfere with business and disturb credit in the countries which endeavoured to apply them.It would be desirable to announce at once that it is not intended to apply such measures.Commercial Payments falling due to Italy.If it is decided to prohibit exports from Italy in order to deprive Italy of the foreign exchange which such exports would yield, it would also be desirable for Member States to which Italy owes trade debts to collect so far as possible all payments falling due to Italy from day to day for past imports, in order to liquidate the trade debts due from Italy. Where Clearing Offices exist, no further action, is necessary; where no Clearing Offices exist, they should be set up. (Under the Anglo-Italian Payments Agreement, a clearing procedure exists, but it is not fully effective, in the absence of any compulsion on British importers to pay debts to the Clearing Account; and the question of setting up a Clearing Office might have to be considered. Debts financed by Bills of Exchange raise special difficulties.)Financial Payments due to Italy.On the other hand, it would not be desirable to interfere in any way with &quot;financial&quot; payments due to Italy, e.g., the service of loans, interest on mortgages, profits, royalties, licences, fees, &amp;c. Any prohibition on such payments would do little harm to Italy, would be difficult to enforce, and would in many cases injure business interests in the countries which attempted to enforce them. ,Insurance and Reinsurance.There should be no interference with the discharge of liabilities under existing contracts; any such measures would inflict lasting damage on the financial centres which enforced them. The prohibition of future insurance business would cause no serious damage to Italy (which could set up Government Insurance schemes) and would not appear to be a desirable form of economic pressure.4. Refusal of Italian imports.An embargo by all League countries on all imports from Italy would cut off some 70 per cent, of Italy&apos;s export trade. The additional strain placed on the Italian exchange is the subject of a separate note (Appendix C). Tables showing the distribution of Italy&apos;s export trade are attached (Appendix B).It will be seen that the United Kingdom and France, even if acting alone, could make a noticeable addition to the strain on Italy&apos;s finances. Their action would reduce Italy&apos;s exports by about one-sixth, as it appears unlikely that non-participating countries would increase their imports from Italy to any large extent.The embargo proposal has many advantages over others that have been put forward. It could be put into operation without any need for the exercise of belligerent rights and without necessarily causing complications with non-participating countries.
The following points would require to be examined and settled in advance : (a) Certificates of origin, in order to prevent imports from Italy via othercountries. If an effective embargo is imposed by all members of the League, certificates of origin would not be required for imports from such countries, and as Germany is the only European country not a member of the League, the requirement could probably be confined to imports from Germany.(b) The treatment of Italian goods en route to League members when the embargo was imposed. No difficulty would arise if these were exempted.(c) The treatment of goods in transit through League countries on the way to-non-League countries (e,g., U.S.A.).(d) The treatment of Italian goods the purchase of which has already beencontracted for by firms in League countries. (Presumably no-exemption should be allowed.)5. Refusal to allow Italian merchant vessels to make use of League ports.This proposal would appear to be a logical part of any general embargo on imports from and exports to Italy. It would create considerable difficulties for Italian sea-borne trade by depriving Italian vessels of bunkering and other port facilities. A further study of the figures of Italian shipping is being made in order to see whether it is possible to estimate the extent of the difficulties this measure would impose on Italy. It is possible that this would be regarded by Italy as extremely provocative, because to all countries their mercantile marine is usually a tender spot. The suggestion was, nevertheless, put forward informally by French officials at Geneva, and therefore deserves consideration. It has the advantages of being comparatively easy to administer and of inflicting no loss on the participating countries.6. Refusal of supplies to Italy.We have not so far considered the withholding of supplies, such as water from Aden, to the Italian East African Forces in the field.The French suggestion is that we should prohibit the export of essential raw materials to Italy.An analysis of the sources of supply open to Italy of various &apos;&apos; key &apos;&apos; materials is contained in Appendix A. It is clear from this analysis that a simple prohibi-tion of exports to Italy by members of the League (even assuming that it is effectively enforced by all members) would produce serious irritation, while its deterrent effect would be doubtful, and in any case long-deferred. Italy might be unable to obtain tin and cobalt; she might also have difficulty in securing adequate supplies of iron ore and scrap over a long period, but there would be no immediate shortage; otherwise supplies of essential metals would be obtainable in adequate quantities either from home production or from non-Member States. As regards most other essential raw materials, serious difficulties could only be anticipated in the case of rubber and timber; moreover, Italy could obtain rubber manufactures (e.g., tyres) from Germany and possibly the U.S.A. and the prohibition of timber exports would not be wholly effective if, as is probable, Austria does not co-operate in any agreed embargo. There remain the two most important raw materials, coal and petroleum, for which Italy is almost entirely dependent on foreign supplies. The United Kingdom supplies, at present, some 40 per cent, of Italian coal imports, but there is no doubt whatever that Germany (which already supplies 40 per cent.) could furnish Italy with all the coal she required; moreover, existing stocks of coal in Italy are probably sufficient to last some months. Italy at present imports more than half her supplies of petroleum from Roumania. She could obtain adequate supplies from any one of the following States: U.S.A., U.S.S.R., Persia or Roumania. The extra demands for tanker tonnage involved might cause considerable difficulty, but the US.A. could probably provide sufficient tonnage to meet the extra requirements.The above analysis leads us to the conclusion that Italy would probably manage to obtain her essential supplies for a considerable period unless belligerent rights were exercised (i.e., the prevention of imports by sea from non-participating [12181] &apos; &apos; B 2
States). But belligerent rights as against States outside the League could only be obtained if there were a state of war with Italy, and. even then effective stoppage of Italian seaborne supplies, other than contraband of war, could only be achieved, if it proved possible to declare a technical blockade.The general conclusion is that a prohibition of essential exports to Italy would, without a state of war, be comparatively ineffective even over a long period.The administration of an embargo on the export of certain specified goods to Italy should not present exceptional difficulties provided that (a) the precise scope of the list of goods to be prohibited were agreed with other countries; (b) no attempt were made to prevent reshipment of prohibited exports via non-partici-pating countries by a system of licensing exports. A serious difficulty might, in fact, arise in the case of non-participating States. Rationing, which might in any case provoke serious resentment, might not be altogether effective, especially if the price offered in Italy for the commodity in question rose very high. It has been suggested that the only solution might be to set up organisations of favourably disposed people in the neutral countries to receive a commodity and supervise the distribution. This is one of the most formidable proposals suggested in the discussions of the Committee of Thirteen at Geneva.The rationing of neutrals might in any case give rise to treaty difficulties. We are not entitled to prohibit or restrict exports to Germany, unless we similarly prohibit or restrict exports to all other countries. Yet we should not wish, in practice, to ration participating countries. Moreover, to single out one State (e.g., Germany) for rationing might be considered a public declaration that she was especially associated with Italy. Rationing should, therefore, we suggest, not be adopted until the need is clearly proved, even at the risk of allowing certain extra supplies to reach Italy through the non-participating countries.It seems clear that it would be impracticable and inadvisable to adopt a system of licensing, in the absence of a state of war with Italy, although the absence of control over re-exports would of course seriously diminish the effectiveness of the embargo.A possible, but less effective, alternative would be to require some form of statutory declaration from exporters that, to the best of their knowledge, the goods were not intended for reshipment to Italy, and which would also make them liable to penalties if they did not take all reasonable steps to secure that the final destination is not Italy.An embargo on exports to Italy alone would be contrary to the provisions of the Anglo-Italian Commercial Treaty, but we are advised that these provisions may be disregarded if, but only if, our action is duly taken under Article 16 of the Covenant on a resolution of the Council of the League.It has further been suggested that any embargo on exports to Italy should be accompanied by a prohibition of the carriage of prohibited goods from any country to Italy on ships of the participating countries. This would undoubtedly assist the effectiveness of the embargo.The essential commodities might be divided into (1) Fuel, (2) Essential minerals.The analysis above shows that a refusal to supply fuel might not be very effective. However, the United Kingdom is known to be particularly sensitive in respect of her coal trade, and an offer to prohibit exports of coal to Italy if other countries would prohibit exports of coal and oil might set a good example.There are certain other possibilities, some of which have been mentioned by the French.  They include :  ((i) The Suspension of Postal Communications.It is clear that any such action would be unwarranted and unnecessary unless there were a complete cessation of economic and financial relations with Italy. Moreover, a suspension of postal communications would only be effective if it were practically universal. This would not be the case, and a considerable leakage via non-participating States, e.g., Germany, would be inevitable.As regards the Treaty aspect, it is arguable, though not quite so certain, that the same considerations would apply as in the case of an embargo on exports or imports.If there were an embargo on imports from Italy, incoming parcels would, of course, be stopped by the Customs.
o(ii) The withdrawal of facilities for marine and other insurance.It would be impossible to terminate immediately the existing arrangement under which Italian vessels are insured in London on 12-month policies. The policies on individual vessels are for 12 months and may begin at any time. It is in any case very doubtful whether any effective pressure would be exercised by terminating the facilities afforded by the London market, as they relate only to re-insurance.(iii) The prohibition of the sale and chartering of vessels to Italy.It would be impossible to render a prohibition of sale and chartering of vessels to Italy completely effective except by prohibiting sale and chartering to all countries except under licence. A prohibition applied to Italy only, would, however, have a considerable deterrent effect and should be imposed as part of any agreed arrangement for prohibiting essential exports to Italy.Provisional Conclusions.(i) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should agree to continue the embargo on the export of arms and munitions to Italy;(ii) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should concur in any proposal that Member States should (a) Prohibit loans and credits to Italy;(&amp;) Collect trade debts due to Italy to liquidate trade debts due by Italy.They should not (except by way of reprisal) interfere with bank balances or other property of Italians, nor with financial payments due to Italy, nor with marine or other insurance.(iii) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should be prepared, in agreement with at least France (and preferably with other Member States), to impose an embargo on all imports from Italy;(iv) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should be prepared, if the proposal is pressed by other Governments, to join in an examination of the proposal not to allow Italian merchant vessels to make use of League ports;(v) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should be prepared to impose an embargo on exports of coal to Italy, on condition that other Member States impose an embargo on exports of coal and oil;(vi) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should only concur in a proposal for an embargo on the export of essential materials to Italy at the request of other Member States;(vii) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should be prepared, in agreement with other Member States, to prohibit the sale or chartering of ships to Italy;(viii) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should not accept proposals for the suspension of postal communications;(ix) That, so far as possible, agreement should be reached with other Member States as to the details of the operation of any proposals adopted, and not merely only on the principles.(Signed on behalf of the Committee) :W.

(Secret.)Notes on Italy&apos;s Supplies of Materials used Directly or Indirectlyin the Production of Munitions.I. Minerals.Coal and Oil.Italy s output is only about 80,000 tons of hard coal and under 1 million tons of lignite annually. In spite of the increased development of hydro-electric power it is difficult to see how she can avoid importing about 10 million tons of coal and coke a year. The maximum post-war importation was 14,500,000 tons in 1929; in 1932 it was 8f million tons.   In 1934 importation was as follows :  Million tons.Anthracite      ... ... ---        1&quot;*Bituminous coal ... 10-4Lignite ... - - - - - - - - -        0-gas coke ... ..- ---        0-25Metallurgical coke        ... &quot;&apos;&apos;Of the coal 40 per cent, came from Germany, 40 per cent, from Great Britain and 10 per cent, from Poland. Of the coke Germany supplied 50 per cent, and Poland, Great Britain, France and Belgium each about 10 per cent.Stocks equivalent to about 6 months&apos; supply of coke and coal are reported to be held.Toluol, which is obtained by distilling coal tar, would be required in considerable quantities for explosives.It seems, however, that all the necessary supplies could be obtained from Germany and the market once lost to this country might never be regained.Petroleum. Annual requirements of petroleum in all forms are now about 2 million tons, of which domestic sources of supply provide only about 25,000 tons. Italy relies on seaborne imports from Roumania, U.S.S.R., the U.S.A. and Persia. The present capacity of tank storage is estimated at 750,000 tons, but it is reported that it is intended to increase this to provide a reserve equal to one year&apos;s estimated war requirements. Italy has of late imported one-half of her requirements from Roumania. She would be able to meet her requirements from any one of the US.A., the U.S.S.R., Persia or Roumania.Iron and Steel.The production of iron ore is between 500,000 and 750,000 tons a year. About 500,000 tons of ore are imported, of which about one-third comes from the U.S.S.R. and 20 per cent, from Algeria. Probably there could be some development of home resources, but it seems doubtful whether this could be undertaken sufficiently rapidly to meet the maximum capacity of Italian steel-works of 3,000,000 tons a year. Steel production was about two-thirds of that amount in 1934.  If the normal sources were cut off there is no obvious substitute.The position of ferro-alloys is of some importance. Italy with her water power has ample capacity for production, but, except in the case of ferro-silicon, the raw materials must be imported. Manganese is only produced on a small scale in Italy. Supplies are mainly drawn from India and Russia, but these sources and also the Gold Coast, the other large producer, would be closed to her. A possible source is Brazil which has in the past been a large producer and the mines are probably controlled by the US. A. Given supplies of iron ore for maximum steel production Italy would require up to 100,000 tons of manganese a year and this would probably be difficult to obtain. It seems likely, however, that she holds a considerable reserve of ferro-manganese.Unless satisfactory stocks are already held there would be considerable difficulty about obtaining some of the materials for the ferro-alloys required for special steels, e.g., tungsten and chrome, but molybdenum and possibly
vanadium could be obtained from the TJ.S.A. Further, whatever the position about manufacture in Italy, Germany and the U.S.A., and to some extent Japan are available sources for the supply of ferro-alloys themselves.Italy is also a large importer of scrap, and this might be difficult to obtain (especially in the form of old ships) from America and Germany, except at a very high price.Apart from her home production, Italy depends on considerable imports of semi-finished steel, and even if home production fell off, owing to a shortage of ore, both the deficit and the increased war requirements could probably be made good from Germany and the U.S.A.Aluminium. The bauxite deposits and reduction works are sufficient for all requirements. The only difficulty would be cryolite which is a necessity and is obtainable only from Greenland. Artificial cryolite could, however, be manu-factured.Lead. Italy, in recent years, has produced some 30,000 tons annually, over half of which is from imported ores. She also imports on balance some 10,000 tons of pig lead, &amp;c.; 66 per cent, of her imports of lead ore and pig lead come from Spain and 16 per cent, from Mexico. Unless reserves are held, the increased war demand might outpace the development of her home resources, but Germany and the U.S.A. have a surplus available for export.Zinc. Italy produces considerable quantities of zinc, including electrolytic zinc, and is also an exporter of ores. There might be some deficiency at the outset unless stocks are held owing to increased demand and neither Germany nor the U.S.A. apparently has any large surplus available.Tin. Italy is entirely dependent upon imports of tin and the main tin smelters are either in the Empire or in participating States. Bolivia is a large producer of ores, but has no smelter capacity. The smelter capacity of Italy itself seems to be very small, though some production of secondary metal might be developed.Copper. The production of copper ore and of smelter copper in Italy is insignificant, and normal imports of ingots, &amp;c, are between 60-70,000 tons. There are, however, available sources of supply in the U.S.A. and Chile.Nickel is not produced in Italy. It mainly comes from Canada, Norway and New Caledonia. There is the possibility, however, that the Canadian ore might be refined in the U.S.A. and exported thence to Italy. At present most of the refining is done in Canada and the United Kingdom.Antimony. Italy has a considerable production of antimony which by development and by cutting out non-essential civilian uses could probably be made to serve.Cobalt mostly comes from the Empire and Belgian Congo though some of the Indian ores are smeltered at Hamburg. Italy is entirely dependent upon imported supplies.Mercury. Italy has ample supplies.Magnesium. Italy also depends upon imports for her magnesium supplies, but these could probably be obtained from Germany which now has a large production. Magnesite which is required for lining steel furnaces, especially if chromite is not available, is to some extent produced locally and supplies are also drawn from Austria and Greece. It is possible that local supplies could be developed to meet requirements.Other minerals which might present difficulties are abrasives (though the manufacture of artificial abrasives could perhaps be undertaken), mica mainly from India and phosphates (required for superphosphates) are mainly drawn from French North Africa.   The latter could perhaps be obtained from Tripoli.Sulphur and pyrites. Italy has ample resources.II. Other Materials.Rubber. Italy is almost entirely dependent upon the British Empire and the Dutch East Indies for her rubber supplies and, although she is understood to have a fair reserve, it would be practically impossible to meet her requirements from other sources. At the same time it must be recognised that the principal use of rubber is in the manufacture of rubber tyres, and that the U.S.A., Germany ; and possibly even Japan could furnish her requirements of tyres and other rubber goods.
Timber seems to be one of the key materials. Home production is small and imports are over \\ million tons, largely from Yugoslavia and Austria. The possibility of supplies from Austria continuing must be envisaged, but it seems unlikely that the deficit could be met by imports from non participating countries.Wood pulp has also to be imported. Imports in 1934 amounted to 250,000 tons from Sweden, Austria, Finland, Czechoslovakia and Germany. Cellulose has important uses in munitions, but the supplies required for this particular purpose would not be very great and could probably be met from Austria (if she were still supplying) and from Germany. To some extent the requirements of paper-mills could be met from the same source, while Germany may have an exportable surplus of yarn which could be used in the artificial silk trade.Cotton. The cotton textile industry is entirely dependent upon imported supplies, which amounted to 190,000 tons in 1934. So long as the U.S.A. is ready to supply, however, no difficulty would arise.Raw Wool. The consumption in 1934 was about 80,000 tons, of which 70,000&apos; tons were imported. Even if Empire supplies were cut off, however, she might be able to meet at least the essential part of her requirements from non-participating States.Hemp is in large supply and is normally exported in considerable quantities. For jute, however, Italy is entirely dependent upon India, but if the supplies were not available, for many purposes hemp could be used as a substitute.Raw Silk.- Home production is more than sufficient for normal requirements and large quantities are exported. There is a substantial artificial silk industry which, however, is dependent upon imported cellulose (see note on wood pulp above).Leather. Italy is an exporter of heavy hides used in the manufacture of sole leather. If these supplies were retained in the country and supplemented by leather and hides from the U.S.A., war requirements could probably be met.Oil Seeds. Italy imports some 400,000 tons of oil seeds annually (50 per cent, from British India and Ceylon and 10 per cent, from China). The home pro-duction of olive oil in 1934 was 180,000 tons. Apart from their food value, vegetable oils are required for the production of glycerine for munitions. The home production of olive oil used for this purpose would yield some 20,000 tons of crude glycerine, which would be far more than is necessary. The loss of supplies of seeds from participating countries could partly be made good by increased imports of soya beans from Japan, &amp;o, and of castor seeds (castor oil is particularly important as an aeroplane lubricant) from Brazil.Preserved Meat. The main sources of world supply are the U.S.A., Argentina and Australia. It might be possible to meet requirements from the U.S.A., and these could be supplemented to some extent by importations from Brazil, though the industry in that country is not believed to be very large.Machine tools would be required in large quantity for the production of munitions, and Italy does not make the range that would be required. She should have no difficulty in meeting her needs, however, from the U.S.A. and Germany.

Sanctions and Italy&apos;s External Costs.A certain portion of the cost of an Abyssinian campaign will involve Italy in external expenditure. This will be in part direct, in that materials and commodities must be bought abroad for military purposes; in part indirect, in that productive resources which might otherwise be available for export business, and shipping, which might otherwise earn freights abroad, will be diverted to warlike uses. In the existing state of depression the indirect external cost through diversion will be much less than under conditions of normal business. How great the external cost will be it is hardly possible to estimate. Figures of  50,000,000 to  100,000,000 a year have been suggested, but they are of course little more than guesses.Whatever the figure, the result will be seen partly in increased imports and, partly in decreased exports. The latter will be to some extent decreased invisible exports in the form of shipping freights.In the absence of any interference in the form of sanctions, Italy would have the following resources to draw upon to meet external expenditure :  (1) Loans and Credits abroad. In the present state of her credit, loans would probably be limited to those subscribed by people of Italian race or sympathy in North and South America; the sums raised would not be very large and the terms would be onerous. If, however, the course of events were such as to enhance Italian prestige, loans floated abroad might have to be reckoned upon.Credits would, under present conditions, be of limited importance. Italian banks could do something by pushing their credit with their correspondents and other foreign institutions to the limit, and importers might try to obtain longer credit than usual. But at a time when foreign exchange control has brought all lira obligations under suspicion, very little could be hoped for from these sources. Recently they have tended to be restricted rather than extended.(2) Import restrictions can be intensified. At the present time Italian imports amount to about  120 millions a year. They are already subject to severe restrictions. But in case of war the restrictions would undoubtedly be increased. The imports of materials for war-like purposes would to some extent take the place of those normally required for civil needs. For example, the army will require a large output of textiles, of which the materials will have to be imported. In peace conditions there would be great resistance to the exclusion of these materials on the ground of the consequent dislocation of industry. But no dis-location is caused if the industry is simply turned over from civil to military needs, and continues to import substantially the same materials as before. The army clothing would then be supplied at any rate for a time, simply at the cost of the civilian population going short. Again the use of iron and steel and other metals in construction and other activities for civil purposes could probably be restricted, and a certain amount of scrap could be collected. On the other hand, a part of the normal imports would be required for indispensable civilian uses, and a part for use in manufacture for export. How far it would be possible to reduce the need for external resources by a restriction of imports we, of course, cannot say. Perhaps we may put the adverse balance of payments under the conditions contemplated at from  20 to  60 millions.(3) The only other resource is to be found in the Italian reserves of gold and foreign exchange. These reserves, so far as disclosed in the last return of the Bank of Italy, amount to  85,000,000 (at 141s. an ounce). To this something must be added for foreign investments not yet realised, but there are likewise undischarged liabilities, and it is not certain that the real sum available is any greater.Thus, if it be assumed that the whole of the reserves will be spent to the last lira, then, apart from any question of sanctions, there would be little likelihood of Italy coming to the end of her resources unless the Abyssinian campaign were prolonged for years.
. What then would be the effect of those sanctions which are specially aimed at her external resources ? Italian exports amount to about  80 millions a year. Shipping freights may possibly add another  10 millions, making  90 millions in all.In order to estimate the field in which sanctions have to work, we must deducfT (1) the exporting power diverted to warlike purposes, and (2) the imported (or importable) materials used in the production of the exported goods.   Perhaps the former sum may be put at  10,000,000 and the latter at 20 per cent, of the balance, i.e.,  16,000,000.   We thus arrive at  64,000,000 of net exports.With that figure and the limits of  20,000,000 and  60,000,000 for the estimates of external war costs we may arrive at a series of estimates of the time within which Italy would find her external resources exhausted, according to the percentage by which her exports are reduced :  i External I    Costs. i !

In view of the German example they may be willing to come very near doing this. But they are more likely to aim at keeping something in hand.  To that extent the periods must be shortened.On the other hand it must be remembered that the existing difficulties in Italy as regards the foreign exchange position are largely due to the attempt to maintain the value of the lira near to its present gold parity. If the lira were allowed to depreciate, these difficulties would pro tanto be diminished and Italy would be ,able to continue the Abyssinian War for a correspondingly longer period. The external liabilities would thus be met, in part or in whole, at the cost of a depression of the standard of living and the strain on the monetary reserves, relieved.Under those conditions exports would present a bigger target, and the effect of sanctions directed against them would be correspondingly greater. But that does not mean that the time-limits calculated above would be any the shorter. On the contrary since the surviving exports would be stimulated, they would actually be longer.o
