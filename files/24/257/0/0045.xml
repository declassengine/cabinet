THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1935.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.CP. 225 (35).CABINET.DISPUTE BETWEEN ITALY AND ABYSSINIA.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues records of conversations which Sir Robert Vansittart and I had with General Garibaldi on 25th November and 28th November respectively.S. PLForeign Office, November 29, 1935.Record of Conversation between &apos;Sir R. Vansittart and General Garibaldi,November 25, 1935.GENERAL GARIBALDI came to see me to-day. He began by reiterating his apprehension lest the enforcement of an embargo on oil should drive Signor Mussolini to desperation (not madness but a calculated desperation) and lead to the enlargement of the area of hostilities. I did my best to explain to the General that this would be aggravated, suicide, and he said that he was well aware of that, but that he was none the less afraid of its taking place. He went on to say that Signor Grandi, who appeared to be in an unhealthy state of gloom, had actually said to him that if an oil embargo was enacted, Italy would leave the League of Nations, and that he, Signor Grandi, had instructions to close the Embassy and leave only a Charge d&apos;Affaires. General Garibaldi felt sure that Signor Grandi was saying more than he was entitled to say, but this kind of thing seemed symptomatic of the kind of dangerous pessimism that Signor Grandi might be inspiring at Rome.General Garibaldi went on to say, in this connexion, that he had seen Signor Mussolini five times during his four days&apos; stay in Rome, and had had lengthy conversations with him. In the course of these Signor Mussolini had said quite plainly and categorically that he had been misled by Signor Grandi as to the state of public opinion in England, and that if he had realised it he would never have embarked upon his present adventure. Being in it, he was of course concerned to get out of it honourably, but he regretted his position because he had been led to believe that if M. Laval acquiesced, as he was of course expected to do, no difficulty would be raised on the British side; and this, I gather, he may also have been given to understand by the French.It remained therefore to get out of the imbroglio as well and as speedily as possible. General Garibaldi said that for this purpose Signor Mussolini had authorised him to state categorically that Italy would, be prepared to cease&apos; hostilities and come to Geneva again to put her case to the. League of Nations if she were assured in advance of some such arrangement as that sketched on the annexed piece of paper, which had been taken down by the General, at Signor Mussolini&apos;s dictation. (See Annex.) General Garibaldi hastened to say that he was well aware that these points were practically identical with those&apos; which had been communicated to M. Laval some time ago, but that they were-of course not final and were subject to any reasonable modification.I glanced at them and said to the General that he would of course realise that, in several respects these suggestions went further than it could possibly be expected that either the League or the Emperor of Abyssinia could accept, 8213   [12401]
and I begged the General to dismiss from his mind any idea, if -he had it, that either the League or Abyssinia would or could accept just anything that France and England put up to them. The General said at once that he had never had any such idea and fully realised the truth of my observation. He was aware that it must be taken into full account, but he was proposing to stay in London until he could have an indication of our views as to the terms of settlement.I replied that this might put me in some embarrassment, because, as he was no doubt aware, Mr. Peterson was already in Paris discussing matters with the French. The General replied that nevertheless he would wait in London for a further communication from me.R. V.November 25, 1935.Record of Conversation between Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and General Garibaldi, November 28, 1935.General Garibaldi called upon me this morning. I had already seen him during the former visit that he paid to London some weeks ago, and Sir Robert Vansittart had seen him in the course of the last few days. The interview produced certain new features that are worth recording. Being a Garibaldi and the son of my old friend, Ricciotti Garibaldi, he did not underrate the importance of the part that he had been playing behind the scenes. He had seen Signor Mussolini five times in the course of four days and, according to his own account, had shifted him from the rigid position that he had at first adopted. The result of these conversations was to convince the General that there was a chance of a reasonable peace, provided that action was taken quickly and the British Government took a more definite initiative in making proposals. When I pointed out to the General that whenever we had made proposals to Signor Mussolini he had turned them down, and there seemed to me to be little likelihood of his accepting our basis of negotiation all the more so as he seemed to be unwilling to accept even a more favourable basis from the French, the General replied that we were the people who counted, and Signor Mussolini would attach much more importance to what we said than to anything that was said by the French or that came through- a French channel. I told him that while this might be the case, I had been particularly depressed by the reception that Signor Mussolini had given Baron Aloisi when he recently returned from Geneva to Rome. Baron Aloisi and I had virtually agreed upon a gentlemen&apos;s arrangement providing for a Mediterranean detente, and he had expressed his satisfaction both to M. Laval and to myself. When he returned to Rome, his action was at once repudiated, Signor Mussolini declaring that he was not interested in an arrangement of the kind, and was only interested in a general settlement of Mediterranean questions. General Garibaldi&apos;s explanation was interesting from many points of view, not least from the light that it threw upon Signor Mussolini&apos;s mentality. It appears that Baron Aloisi returned to Rome via Munich, and that at Munich he attempted to get a meeting arranged between Herr Hitler and himself for the purpose of enlisting more active German support for the Italian cause. It seems that Signor Mussolini had given him no instruc-tions for such a visit. In any case, he was furious to find that it had taken place, with the result that upon Baron Aloisi&apos;s return he repudiated everything that his agent had done. Baron Aloisi seems to have described in detail to General Garibaldi the whole of this curious incident.When we turned from this explanation to the immediate position, General Garibaldi produced a note given him by Signor Mussolini of the terms that Italy was ready to accept. I attach a copy (see Annex). He then took out ;a notebook and asked me whether I would give him my comments to take back to Signor Mussolini. I told him that it was impossible for me to go into any detail until Mr. Peterson&apos;s return from Paris. I was, however, prepared to say at once that Signor MussolinFs proposals would never be accepted by the League or Abyssinia and that we could not support them. I then went through them with the General, pointing out that their cumulative effect would be to wipe out Ethiopia as an independent State. He did not seem to demur from this comment. Indeed, it was quite clear to me that he and presumably Signor Mussolini himself
had only put them forward as^a basis. for bargaining. He did, however, fully admit the need for making some kind of concession to the Emperor, and did hot&apos; at all object to the cession of an outlet to the sea at Zeila.Over and over again in the course of the conversation he implied that if we: would give him our detailed comments upon these proposals, he would return to Rome and do his utmost to persuade Signor Mussolini to modify his demands. I own that I was impressed by his obvious sincerity and his fervent desire to find some basis of agreement. He finally declared, that he would not leave, London until I could give him a definite answer to his request. This I told him would be impossible until Mr. Peterson had returned from Paris.S. H.Foreign Office, November 28, 1935.Annex.Document communicated by General Garibaldi to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Sir Robert Vansittart.I.
