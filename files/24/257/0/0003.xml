THE COAL SITUATION.Miners&apos;_campaign for a wage increase.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.In fulfilment of my promise at the meeting on 24th September (Cabinet 43 (35),  Conclusion 7),  I circulate to my colleagues a memorandum by the Secretary for iaines on the subject of the miners1 campaign for a wage increase.I agree generally with the conclusions of the Secretary for- Aline s, name ly,(l) that (for the present at any rate) no overt action should  oe ta^en by the Government;    the question whether such action is desirable later can be considered after the miners&apos; delegate conference on the 17th October; (2) that in the meantime,  the Secretary for Mines should:-(a) by unobtrusive pressure endeavour to induce the owners to meet the men nationally;(b) continue to press the owners to co-ordinateminimum prices and taice effective steps to prevent evasions;    and(c) see what can be done as regards further districtschemes of organised selling on the lines of the Lancashire scheme already approved^W.R.Board of Trade,27th September,  1935.
MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY FOR MINES ON THE CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED BY THE MINSWORKERS&apos;  FEDERATION OP GREAT BRITAIN FOR A WAGE INCREASE.The Miners&apos;  Case.The miners&apos;  case, which is set out officially in their &quot;campaign specials&quot; and supported Py speeches by Mr.  Joseph Jones, Mr. Ebby Edwards and others,  is briefly for (a) national wage discussions or,  alternatively,   (b) a flat rate wage increase of 2/- a day for all workers in the industry.(a) National Wage Discussions.In the House of Commons not long before the adjournment I promised to make a further endeavour to get the owners and men together.      Following on this promise I discussed the matter with Sir Evan Williams and wrote officially inviting the Mining Association to meet the Mineworkers&apos; Federation, and offering myself to take the Chair if that should be the desire of both parties.      The answer on both occasions was a flat refusal.      While I appreciate the reasons for the owners&apos;  dislike of national wage discussions,  I think the inflexibility of their attitude is a mistake,  especially as the miners have very much moderated their demand in the last year or two.      They no longer-ask for a national wago agreement but merely for some national supervision Of District Agreements which they justify by the allegation, which I believe to be true,  that applications for wage increases under District Agreements are weakened by their effect on other districts not concerned with the arbitration. In the present case Mr.  Ebby Edwards has apparently moderated the claim still further, as he is quoted as having said:-&quot;The remedy is with the Mining Association of Great Britain   I who should immediately enter into negotiations with the Federation on the whole issue,  then the miners&apos;   campaign can cease tomorrow&quot;.
(b) Application for Wages Increase.In putting their case for a wages increase the Mineworkers&apos; Federation state that the owners have had for five years power (under the 1930 Act) to secure a price for coal which would have enabled them to pay reasonable wages.      They have failed to take advantage of  the powers given them and the miners must therefore tackle the problem in another way, by forcing the wages issue and so compelling the owners to organise the industry.This argument is unanswerable.      The 1930 Act gave the coal owners power to regulate prices.      They were probably right, during the depression,  to use this power only to the extent of maintaining prices, as it would probably have made matters still worse for other industries had they attempted, at that time,  to force prices up.      With the general improvement in the  state of trade in this country this power could reasonably have been   used to secure,  at any rate for inland coal, prices which would have permitted better wages to be paid to the miners.      Instead of this prices have in fact declined.      Even in the export market some increases in price should be obtainable if inter-district and inter-pit competition were eliminated,  although the opportunities in the export market are obviously very much less than in the home market.      The Mineworkers&apos; Federation is right when it says that reduction in costs has merely resulted in reductions in pithead prices.      A chart is attached which affords confirmation of this statement and I would like to draw attention to the striking fact that since 1933 prices in the districts mainly concerned with the export markets have remained stable or have risen,  while prices in the markets mainly dependent on inland trade,  where the element of world competition is not present,  shew a steady fall.
ii hiThe two-shilling figure, into which the wage demand has crystallised, need not he taken too seriously as it is probably put forward as a bargaining figure.      There is, however, the possibility that the Mineworkers1 Federation may get so committed to this figure that they may be unable to withdraw from it.Factors favouring Strike Action.There is Undoubtedly a very strong feeling among the rank and file in the mining industry that their wages are too low.      It has been obvious for some time now that this feeiing was gradually hardening into one of resentment, and the agitation for an increased wage is meeting with strong support among the rank and file.      It is noteworthy that South Wales and ^urham have withdrawn their wage applications under the district machinery in favour of the national campaign.The position of the leaders has been strengthened by the very sympathetic receiption accorded, by both public and press, to their demand for better wages.Another factor which has to be taken into account is the possibility that, although the leaders may not themselves intend, or even wish, to take the matter as far as an actual national stoppage, they may, as so often happens, find that they have worked up by iheir propaganda such a strong feeling in t he districts that they may be unable to hold the position and may find themselves compelled^ against their better judgment, to go to extreme limits. Factors against Strike Action.The more level headed section of the mine workers, and thiscovers the majority, appreciate that a national stoppage would dopermanent harm to the industry, and through the industry to theworkers, more than commensurate with any benefits for the workerswhich might be secured by such a   stoppage.     Unfortunately thissection of the mine workers does not attend the meetings or take any part in the campaign, so that the more extreme element willprobably get its way, at any rate until a ballot of the mining-3-
fields is taken.      The more level headed section of the mining community will, however, vote in the ballot, which may consequently show a less aggressive result than the Delegate Conference.      It must be remembered that a 66% vote in favour is necessary before strike action can be taken.Another factor bearing on the situation is the existence of the District Agreements.      The position in this respect is different now from that in 1926 when a National Agreement was terminating and the whole coalfields could take simultaneous action without breach of an agreement.      Now wages are governed by a series of district agreements which do not terminate simultaneously, so that if a general stoppage is called, it could only be effective in defiance of the District Agreements. This would not entail illegal action by the men who, by handing in individual notices simultaneously, could terminate their employment legally.     Nevertheless, it would mean the moral breach of District Agreements, which is contrary to the general action of the mine workers. What can be done by the Government.I feel very strongly that so far as public action is concerned the answer is for the present definitely &apos;nothing&apos;, and that this must be the position at any rate until after the Delegate Conference on the 17th October.      The position of the agitators would be strengthened and a stoppage made more likely if any overt action were taken by the Government at the present time*This does not mean that the Government must remain inactive, and the following are courses of action which might be taken without publicity:-(1) To bring greater pressure on the Mining Association to meet the men nationally.      I think this should be done and I propose to see Sir Evan Williams again as soon as possible.
(S) To continue to bring pressure to bear on the Central Council to co-ordinate minimum prices and take steps to prevent evasions.      The Government is on very strong ground here, since the co-ordination of minimum prices was one of the conditions of the withdrawal of the Government Bill last year, and power to secure it is given to the Central Council in the regulations which became effective on the 1st January.     Nevertheless, so far as I can ascertain, no progress has been made towards any arrangement which would eliminate or reduce inter-district competition in the inland market, and it is notorious that evasions of minimum prices are increasing not decreasing.       I have called upon the Central Council to inform me at an early date what proposals they contemplate to make inter-district co-ordination of prices effective, and what steps they and the District Executive Boards of coal owners propose to take to stop evasions.      I intend to follow this up vigorously, but I ought to point&apos; out that this may lead the owners to ask that the Schemes under the Act shall be amended to permit delivered prices instead of pithead prices to be fixed.      This proposal would be difficult to refuse under these circumstances, but it may lead to criticism.      I have very serious doubts whether,  even if the coal owners do all that can be done in regard to co-ordination of prices and the prevention of evasions, proceeds will be raised sufficiently to provide an answer to the men&apos;s case.      I suggest then that -(3)    I should explore with the Central Council the possibilityof that body securing sanction from the coal owners to promise Schemes of Organised Selling for the districtson the lines of the Lancashire Scheme approved byParliament in June last.      Such a promise would meet agreat part of the miners&apos; case as expressed in both issues of the &quot;Miners&apos; Campaign Special&quot;, particularly the second,-5-
They have &quot;based their whole case on the necessity for organised and controlled selling, and I am in agreement with them in thinking that most of the difficulties in the present administration of the 1930 Act could be overcome and the proceeds of the industry improved by a scheme of district selling agencies under central control.H.F.CMines Department,26th September, 1935.
