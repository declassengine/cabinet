&apos;HIS TOCUMENT; JB. THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S C&amp;vERfflENT.SECRET-3.P.221 (35).COPY NO.cACABINET.UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FOR AGRICULTURE.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.1.The Cabinet have already approved the policy of extending unemploymentinsurance to agriculture (Cabinet 25 (35) Conclusion 7) and legislation to give effect to this decision is to be announced In the King&apos;s Speech.2.The details of a scheme of unemployment insurance for agriculture based in the main on the report of the Statutory Committee appointed under the Unemployment Act, 1934-, was considered by a Committee of the Cabinet before the decision above mentioned was reached.     There was agreement in the Cabinet Committee on most points of substance in the scheme, but the details were not considered by the Cabd.net when agreeing to the general principle.3.       It is most desirable that unemployment benefit should begin to be paid in agriculture by the early winter of next year.     For this purpose it is necessary to pass the Bill into law by Easter, owing to the six months&apos; interval required before benefit begins.       It will not be possible to have a Second Reading of the Bill before Christmas,, but I should like to be able to introduce the Bill before the House rises, in order that members may have the opportunity of considering it during the recess, and that we may, as I hope, proceed with it without delay when the House resumes.4.       For this purpose I ask for authority to have the proposals further considered by the Cabinet Committee so far as may be necessary, and to submit a Bill as soon as possible to the Home Affairs Committee with a view to approval by the Cabinet and introduction as proposed.(Intd.)   E. B.29th November, 1955.H.Q. 1,251 - 65.K.E.
