jffiQO-VEBY 0? CABINET DOCUMENTS. REPORT.1, In March, 1934, the Cabinet had under consideration thequestion of the retention by Ministers of their Cabinet Papers on leaving office and agreed that in future all Cabinet and other Ministers on vacating office should return Cabinet Minutes and Papers issued to them while in office to the Secretary to the Cabinet,,      At the same time the Secretary was instructed to invite the representatives of deceased Ministers to return any such Papers in their possession and also to invite living ex Ministers&apos; to co-operate by returning their Papers to the Cabinet Offices,, For convenience of reference a copy of the Cabinet Conclusion in question is attached hereto (see Appendix).20 As regards Ministers in office, arrangements have beenmade under which in most cases Papers are being returned period-icallya      This is a very convenient practice as it enables the Cabinet Office to deal continuously with the returned Papers instead of being overwhelmed with a flood of Papers on a change of Administration.,30 As regards the Papers of ex-Ministers a very careful examination was made at the outset, with the assistance of the Departments, in order to ascertain the extent tg which post-War Cabinet Papers had been taken away by ex-Ministers on vacating office., In a number of cases it was demonstrated that particular Ministers had taken away no such Papers, but in cases in which there was any doubt at all it was assumed that some Papers had been taken away,,4f! in the result it was found necessary to send out a circular letter in 07 cases in all. Of these 71 were cases of living ex-Ministers and 16 cases of representatives of deceased ex-Ministers e
b0 In 77 of. these 87 cases the Papers have been, or-are &quot;in process of being, recovered.,     The 77 include 62 living ex-Minie/cers and tne representatives of lb deceased ex-^info tiers 0 (Seven oi these are cases in which the individuals concerned have agreed in principle  go return their documents but have not yet actually done so).    In the remaining ten cases, x&apos;or one reason or another, it iu*s not been possible to secure an affirmative reply,      Nine of these are cases of living ex-Ministers and one is an Executors&apos;  case.6e The Executors5  case is that of the late Lord Curzon,,Numerous reminders have been sent to Lady Curzon, but no reply has ever been received,,    This is a case in which it is very doubtful indeed whether the late Lord Curzon had in his possess-ion at the time of his death any post-War Papers, and in all the circumstances it is suggested that no further action in this case should be taken.7, The other nine cases concern the following ex-MinistersMr* Arthur Greenwood,Dr0 Addison,Lord Cecil,Mr, Lloyd George,Mr0 Larsbury,Mho Atlee,Mr. Lees Smith,Mr0 Winston Churchill, andLord Moyne.Of these Mr, Atlee, who was never a Cabinet Minister, only has in his possession certain unimportant Cabinet Committee Papers, The remaining eight all have in their possession copies of Cabinet Minutes and Cabinet or other Memoranda, and the position with regard to them is briefly as followsMr.  Greenwood.    No reply has been received to the original circular or to the reminders which have been sent to him      It is inferred that he is unwilling to co-operate* Djj Addison   has written declining to co-operate0 Lord Cecil.    After the whole position had beenfully explained to him in correspondence. Lord Cecildeclined to co-operate,,-2-     . j
Mr? Lloyd George.    At an interview with Mr0 Lloyd Georgess Private Secretary some months ago it was learned that, while Mr* Lloyd George was willing that his Papers should he returned after his death, he was not prepared to surrender them during his lifetimeo      There is no reason to think that Mrc Lloyd George will reconsider this decision,,Mr,, George Lansburyc.    Apart from a bare acknowledgment no reply has been received, but statements have appeared in the newspapers to the effect that he has no intention of returning his Papers,,MTo Leea Smith has declined to co-operate-Mra Winston Church!31, after considerable correspond-ence has in effect declined to give up his papers,,Lord Moyne has declined to give up his PapersaSt, The Law Officers have advised to the effect that livingex-minister a cannot be compelled to return their Papers during their lifetime, but that the position is different after their death0      Steps can then be taken, if necessary by legal proceedings, against their Executors to enforce the surrender of the Papers,    It is most doubtful whether any useful purpose would be served bj issuing further reminders in these eight or nine outstanding cases,9o from the point of view of the safeguarding of thepublic interest the position is infinitely better now than it was 18 months ago0      In -early SO per cento  of the outstand-ing cases the Papers have been recovered, and of those still outstanding the majority are probably as fully safeguarded against improper access by unauthorised persons as if they were in official custody,,10p It is accordingly suggested that no further action should be taken during the lifetime of the ex-Ministers
who have declined to co-operate, but that on their deaths the Papers should be recovered from their Representatives,, It may be, ef course, that some of them will change their mind and give up their Papers, and if so this will be ail to the good,R.

Special attention was invited to the following-suggestions made in paragraph 18 of Sir Rupert Howorth1sMemorandum :-(a)    That it shall be the duty of all Cabinet Ministers on vacating office to return forthwith all Cabinet Minutes and Papers issued to them while in office to the Secretary to the Cabinet;    and it shall be the duty of the Secretary to the Cabinet to recover all such Papers accordingly;(b) That the same procedure shall be followed in the case of Ministers outside the Cabinet on vacating office;(c) That ex-Cabinet Ministers shall continue to have the right of access to all Cabinet Minutes and Papers issued to them during the time that they were members of the Cabinet,(d) That the Secretary to the Cabinet be instructed to invite the represent-atives of deceased ex-Cabinet ministers to return forthwith to the Cabinet Offices aH post-war Cabinet Minutes and Papers in their possession;(e) That the Secretary to the Cabinet be instructed to write to living ex-Cabinet Ministers inviting them to co-operate by returning their Cabinet Minutes and Papers to the Cabinet Offices, to be kept there in safe custody for them0The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the King was in full agreement with a,P0  6 9(34)0-1-
A suggestion was made that some difficulty might, be encountered in recovering the older papers0    It was explained that the Secretary to the Cabinet had some experience in the matter as in the days of the War Cabinet the rule had been that the Secretariat should recover Cabinet documents,      The same rule had applied to documents of the Committee of Imperial Defenceo      No doubt, however, difficulties must be expected in carrying out the present proposals^      The moment, however, was considered opportune for taking action owing to a recent case in the Law CourtSoIt was pointed out that the suggestions summarised above did not appear to cover the case of members of previous Cabinets who were also members of the present Cabineto      This could be met by the substitution in paragraph (c) of the words &quot;members of previous Cabinets&quot; for &quot;ex--Carh.net Ministers&quot;c      This was agreed to,0Subject to this minor alteration the Cabinet agreed(a) Tc approve the suggestions summarised above;(b) To authorise the Secretary te put the proposals in operation in the spirit as well as in the letter and. endeavour to recover all documents from the termin-ation of the War onwards- other than documents belonging to the present Government which Ministers wished to retain while in office,
