Report by the Air Raid preoautiens (policy)  Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence.The Committee had under consideration a Report by the Air Raid Precautions (Organisation) Sub-Committee (paper No: A.R.P.(P) 42) (attached).      To enable answers to be given to the questions raised by the Air Raid Precautions (Organisation) Sub-Committee in paragraph 10 of their Report, the Sub-Committee make the following recommendations :-(i)    that it is necessary to ensure that at theoutbreak of war respirators should be avail-able in all parus of the country liable to air attack, for all persons not in possession of special respirators.      Special respirators are those which are designed for, and issued to, all personnel who are actively engaged in carrying out air raid precautions measures; (ii)    that the necessary stocks of respirators should be accumulated by the Government, and at the cost of the Government; (iii) that if and when an emergency arises,  respirators should be issued free of charge.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee JOHN SIMON.Chairman,!s Whitehall Gardens,  S.W. 1, 22nd October, 1935.(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OE HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   October 1935.SECRET. Copy No.A.R.P. (P) 42.(Also Paper No. A .R.P. (0) 514.)COMMITTEE OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Air Raids Precautions (Policy) Sub-Committee.POLICY WITH REGARD TO RESPIRATORS.Report by the Organisation Sub-Committee.THE Committee had before it at its .58th Meeting on the 12th July, 1935, a report dated the 6th July, 1935, from a sub-committee which had been appointed to consider the policy regarding the provision of respirators for the protection of the civil population.2. This report contained two recommendations of great importance on the question of the supply of respirators for the general public in time of emergency. They were: (i) It is necessary that immediately on an outbreak of war there should be available in the country respirators for every person who is within an area of probable hostile air attack, (ii) The Government should accept in principle responsibility for accumu-lating in time of peace the necessary stocks of cheap respirators for all members of the public within areas of possible hostile air attack who did not possess general service or special service respirators,* and the source of supply of these cheap respirators needs investigation.3. These recommendations involve decisions of high policy which have considerable financial and possibly political implications and raise issues on which some public pronouncement will be expected at no far distant date. The Air Raid Precautions Department has indeed already received enquiries from various quarters and it is most desirable that a decision should not be long delayed.The Government have already accepted responsibility for supplying respirators, either of the general service or the special service type, for all the personnel engaged on air raid precautions services including police, fire brigades, first aid and decontamination personnel, &amp;c. It is proposed to urge local authorities and others concerned with essential services, such as water supply, electricity works, drainage, &amp;c, to supply the special service respirator for the essential staffs concerned.4. No definite information is available, as to any Government accepting responsibility for arranging the supply of respirators to its civil population as a whole, though certain Governments have recently taken up large sums of money for the purchase of respirators.   Thus  1,000,000 was provided in the French* Subsequent consideration leads to the conclusion that members of the public who have special duties assigned to them, and are therefore equipped with the general service or special service respirator for those duties, may also need to be equipped with the cheap type of respirator.
budget last-year for civilian respirators, the intention being to provide 15,000,000 respirators.&apos; Nevertheless, the Committee find it difficult to see how any compre-hensive scheme for gas defence in this country (or other countries) can ignore the protection of the ordinary public in areas liable to attack. The provision of gas-proof rooms in private houses and public buildings, &amp;c, gives possibly the best form of mass protection, but it would be difficult, if not impossible, to ensure that members of the public should always be within immediate reach of the accommodation earmarked for them, even if a precautionary period of some length could be relied upon. Moreover, if the gas-proofing proved to be inadequate, or became so as the result of enemy action, it would clearly be imperative that the occupants should have some means of preservation pending their removal elsewhere. The absence of the necessary supply of respirators in the event of widespread use of gas by the enemy might not only lead to avoidable loss of life but would, in the Committee&apos;s opinion, also give rise to a degree of public alarm and resentment which might gravely embarrass the Government of the day in the prosecution of the war. On the assumption, therefore, that, notwith-standing the prohibition of the use of poison gas in war contained in the Geneva Gas Protocol of 1925, comprehensive preparations must be made to meet the risk of gas attack directed against the civil population, the Committee are agreed that there is no escape from the conclusion at (i) above.5. The actual areas in which the population may be regarded as being in danger of gas attack must to some extent be a matter of speculation, but it is clear that the most probable areas must be held to include the whole of London and the large towns of the Midlands and the north of England as a minimum. The question whether the same provision need be made for districts farther west and for purely rural parts of the eastern counties would not make sufficient difference to the total to affect the decision as to the means by which those respirators ought to be provided.6. The acceptance of recommendation (i) in paragraph 2 above raises the question of the method by which the necessary numbers of respirators are to be made available on the outbreak of war and, while the Committee is in general agreement with, recommendation (ii) on this point, they feel it necessary to bring to notice other alternatives which appear to be open to the Government in this matter.7. Acceptance by the Government of responsibility for making available stocks of cheap respirators does not necessarily imply that the Government must themselves buy and stock respirators. It would be open to the Government to encourage private manufacturers to make and to sell, and the general public to buy, the cheap type of respirator which in this case would have to be manufactured in accordance with Government specifications and subject to percentage inspection by Government inspectors.Nor again, if the Government is to buy and stock the respirators, does it necessarily follow that the Government need make no charge for the respirators when issued.8. The arguments in favour of requiring the public to buy respirators themselves from commercial sources are as follows : -(a) There is no precedent for the provision by the Government of an article which is required by members of the public for personal use.(b) No other country is known to be undertaking the free supply ofrespirators to its citizens at present, though there are indications of large sums of money being allocated for the purchase of respirators by certain Governments, for example, by the French Government.(c) It is already contemplated that local authorities and others concernedwith essential services should be encouraged to bear the responsibility of equipping their own staffs and, if these staffs are to be equipped from other than State resources, it is questionable whether the Govern-ment should pay for respirators for the rest of the general public.(d) The cost of accumulating Government stocks would be large.    If arespirator can be manufactured for about Is., and assuming that it were decided to accumulate 30 million respirators over a period of five years, the annual cost, exclusive of storage, would be about  ^ million.   The life of certain parts of a respirator, even under the
best conditions of storage, is at present limited and,:.. until better conditions of storage are invented, the annual replacement cost* in subsequent years must be considerable. (e) The accumulation of stocks of respirators by the Government would be useless in itself unless the preparation of a detailed scheme had shown that the respirators could be stored throughout the country in such a way as would enable a very rapid distribution to the public when emergency arose. .,:9. The arguments in favour of the acceptance by the Government of the responsibility of accumulating stocks of the cheap respirator are as follows : (a) It is difficult to conceive that more than a minority of the populationaffected would in fact buy respirators in time of peace. In particular, the obligation would bear hardly on the unemployed and the very poor, and an outbreak of war would find large masses of population in the poorer parts of towns unprovided with respirators, with grave conse-quences to the general morale of the country. Communist elements are already engaged in spreading the story that air raid protection will be for the rich and not for the poor. It is necessary to note that the Trade have already completed plans for producing respirators for sale to the public (under Government control) which will be more expensive, but more efficient, than the cheap respirator now under discussion.(b) Respirators contain rubber components, which are easily perishable, except under conditions of careful storage. For this reason not only would the public have to be induced to replace their respirators every few years, but there would also be a serious risk that respirators bought comparatively recently by ordinary householders would be found to-be of no use when needed, because they had been stored carelessly and in unsuitable places, or had been misused, t To obtain the full life of a batch of respirators requires, in fact, not only controlled conditions of storage, but also periodical expert inspection.(c) The process of persuading the public to buy respirators for themselves would involve continuous Government propaganda, and advertisement by manufacturers, of a kind which would easily lend itself to the accusation of being alarmist propaganda and warmongering.(d) Government propaganda to the public to buy respirators could easily be interpreted as being in the interests of the private profits of manu-facturers. This point was specifically mentioned by the Labour Opposition in the debate on the Home Office Vote on the 16th July, 1935.(e) The provision of the cheap respirators by the Government would no doubtrule out the possibility of selling these respirators to the public, but it need have little effect on the sale of higher grade respirators (e.g., of the Special Service type) which would be known to be more efficient. Higher grade respirators would in any case be needed by the workers in firms and undertakings which would have to continue in operation during air raid conditions, and it is to be anticipated that many members of the public who could afford to buy higher grade respirators for themselves and their families would do so for the greater safety which they would provide, whether or not Government supplies of cheap respirators were going to be available. The respirator industry which would be of most value in time of war would be the industry capable of manufacturing higher grade respirators, which are a different class of article, and it is suggested that the peace time sale of those respirators would be practically unaffected by the decision as to cheap respirators. (/) It is recognised that an essential part of any scheme for the accumulation of cheap respirators by the Government would involve the maintenance of a considerable number of stores scattered over the country, and the preparation of careful plans for the distribution of respirators in an* See note below as affecting replacement cost.f This paragraph might require important modification if the experiments to which reference is made in the last sub-paragraph of paragraph 10 should prove successful.
emergency with the utmost rapidity. It is, however, suggested that the provision of the necessary stores and the preparation of an effective scheme, of distribution are both perfectly feasible propositions. (g) If respirators were to be produced and sold from commercial sources, it &quot;would be necessary for private manufacturers to hold stocks throughout the,country for sale when the emergency arose. Apart from the fact that this would probably mean a payment of a Govern-ment subsidy as an inducement, it is difficult to visualise any commercial arrangement which would enable distribution to take place with sufficient rapidity to have any effect when the emergency arose.10. The Committee therefore submit to the Policy Committee the following questions : (a) Is it necessary to ensure that at the outbreak of war cheap respiratorsshall be available in all parts of the country liable to air attack for all persons not in possession of higher grade respirators ?   If so (b) Should this object be achieved by the accumulation of the necessary stocks at the cost of the Government and by the Government ?(c) Should such stocks be issued free of charge when the emergency arises oron payment?  Or (d) Can the object be achieved by encouraging strictly controlled privateproduction, the general public being required to buy its own respirators ?It is to be noted that, if the answer to (b) is in the affirmative, the question at (c), though it must be answered in time, need not, and indeed ought not, to be finally decided at once, since its answer is or may be dependent upon experiments which are now in progress to produce a method of storage which will enable the issue of. respirators to civilians before an emergency without danger that the respirators will deteriorate.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee :R.
