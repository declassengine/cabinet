54THIS DOCUMENT 15 THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.g E C R E T . Copy No. . .&apos;r. .&apos;. .CP.  189  (55) CABINET.FUMIGATIONS WITH HYDROGEN CYANIDE. Memorandum &quot;by the Home Secretary.1. I wish to bring before my colleagues the question oflegislation to confer power to control the use of hydrogen cyanide for the purpose of fumigation.     In almost all important  countries,  legislation of this kind already exists.2. The use of the gas in this country has until recentlybeen substantially confined to fumigations for the destruction of rats and other vermin in ships and in farms and to fumigations for the destruction of insect pests by market gardeners.      Its use,  however,  is now, following upon the Report of a Committee appointed by the Minister of Health to inquire into the eradication of the bedbug,  becoming more common in connection with the destruction of bugs in dwelling houses and appears likely to become yet more so in the future. It is the most efficacious fumigant known for the object in view.3. The gas, however,  is exceedingly lethal to human beingsas well as to insects and vermin and possesses the additional danger that it can be present in fatal concentrations without being readily noticeable;    and the desirability of some measure of control over its use has for some time been under examination.     Natalities, however, have not been numerous and have occurred generally in connection with ship fumigations, the general public remaining unaffected,  and while various
-2-*51)administrative steps were taken by the Departments concerned to draw attention to the risks and to prevent the use of the gas without adequate precautions, it was not considered that a sufficient case could he shewn for legislation.In April, however, an event occurred in Aldershot to which considerable publicity was given by the Press.     What happened was that the fumigation of certain houses in that town was undertaken for the local authority by a firm specialising in the work and, on the return of the occupants to their houses on the day following the fumigation, several of them were seriously affected and two children fatally poisoned.     This result must, according to a report by one of the Medical Officers of the Ministry of Health, be ascribed to the failure of the operating firm to exercise necessary precautions.      The premises had not been sufficiently ventilated and tested after the fumigation, proper steps had not been taken to ensure that the bedding was free from gas, and the residues not properly disposed of.In these circumstances, the question of legislation has been further considered in consultation with other Departments concerned, viz.,  the Scottish Office,  the Ministry of Health, the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries,   and general agreement has been reached as to the desirability of legislation conferring upon me power to make, in consultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Health (and, where appropriate, any other Minister specially interested),  regulations governing the use of hydrogen cyanide for fumigation.     There are also one or two other dangerous gases which might be put to similar use, and power would be taken for bringing such gases within the scope of the measure by Order in Council.
5BThe proposal is not thought likely to give rise to serious controversy.     Representations have been received from the Institute of Chemistry urging the desirability of statutory control of fumigations, and the same view is taken by those engaged in the manufacture of the gas.      Shipping interests have been consulted and take no objection in principle,  though they ask to have due opportunity to examine the actual regulations before they are made.     Agricultural and horticultural interests are likely to offer opposition as the use of the gas by them is widespread and the concentrations at which it is used so much lower as greatly to reduce the dangers arising.      It is,  however, proposed to limit the scope of the Bill to fumigations carried on in an enclosed space and this should go far to meet any apprehensions on the part of farmers whose fumigations are mainly carried on out of doors; further, as regards fumigations carried on in enclosed spaces by farmers or nursery gardeners, it is thought that any requirements which it may be found necessary to apply to such operations will be of an easy and simple character.      Any regulations affecting agricultural or horticultural interests would, as already indicated, be prepared in consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries .I shall be glad to have the authority of my colleagues to submit a draft Bill as proposed above to the Home Affairs Committee .
