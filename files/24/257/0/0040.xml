o51.     ITALO-ABYSSINIAN DISPUTE.    REVIEW OP THE SITUATION.Presentpoliticalsituation.THE SUB-COMMITTEE considered, a verbal statement made by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and also the following papers:-A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War making proposals for the defence of Western Egypt. (Paper No,  D.P.R.   55).A despatch from the Foreign Office to H.M.Ambassador in Paris, covering a reply on the part of the British Admiralty to the French Ministry of Marine on the subject of Franco-British co- -operation in the Mediterranean.   (Paper No. D.P.R.   50. )SIR SAMUEL HOARE said he thought the Committee might wish to hear a statement from him on the political situation as it had developed since the last meeting of the Sub-Committee.      The situation was, in fact, no clearer, but in some respects it was more clangorous.      On the credit side could be placed the fact that the application of sanctions to Italy had been more effective than some persons had thought probable.      Moreover,  it appeared from a recent General Staff appreciation that Italian operations in Abyssinia were not going fast, and that they would be forced to pause in their operations in the north for a considerable -time, In fact it seemed that they would have difficulty in forcing a decision before the wet season began in the Spring.On the other hand, Signer Mussolini was in an intransi-gent mood.    For example, he himself had thought that he had arrived in Geneva,at a satisfactory arrangement with Baron Aloisi for a Moditerranean detente.      But Signor Mussolini had subsequently repudiated Barpn Aloisi and said that he was not interested in mere matters of detail, but wanted the whole future position in the Mediterranean to be discussed.      The impression given was that Signor&apos; Mussolini did not desire serious negotiations at the. \i -1-   ..,     &apos; i AA::.
present time, at any rate there was no advance to report in this connection.      There were many rumours that Italy was getting to the point at which she might have to take action and make a &quot;sortie&quot;, and the circumstances under which, it was suggested,  this might take place, were ii sanctions were imposed such as to humiliate Italy or to threaten her national life.      Moreover, any attack,  it was rumoured, was to he upon us.      This was a fact which could not he ignored, hut there was much Italian propaganda being spread and there was&apos;certainly an element of propaganda in these whispers.,      A.s an example, Signor G-randi, when he had paid a recent visit to him at the Foreign Office, had openly stated that it would be his &quot;last visit&quot;, yet he had asked for and obtained&quot; subsequent interviews.      he was,  therefore, himself inclined to think that some, at least, of this Italian propaganda was being used to frighten us.This question bore directly on an important issue of the moment, i.e.  the proposed embargo on oil exports to Italy.      He was circulating a paper on this question, but he would not invite discussion on the subject today as it was a matter which would require very careful consideration, and he proposed to raise it in the Cabinet.      For the moment it was sufficient to say that in view of the existence of the proposal for oil sanctions the threatening attitude of Italy could not be ignored,,    He was far from suggesting that an aggression by Italy was a*b all probable, but our defensivesituation ought to be kept under constant and urgent ohservationoThe above being the political&apos; situation at the moment,there were certain questions which he suggested should beconsidered by the Committee:-(i)    Supposing Italy was to commit an aggression what was our position in the Mediterranean from the point of view of the Defence
Services, and in particular, what stocics of anti-aircraft ammunition were now available in Malta, Egypt and Aden,  and how long would they last?(ii)   What was the present position regarding naval conversations with the French Ministry of Marine?   We had accepted the French, view that mobilisation of the French forces could not be carried out until an aggression was committed, and the consequent effect that French assistance would not be available until some time after the outbreak of war. Had the matter developed any further than this?(iii)    It had also been suggested that the French should approach Spain with a view to the use of Spanish ports in the event of an aggression.    Was there any information as to developments in this direction?(iv)    The King of Greece had suggested that if there was any proposal.to use a Greek port for the British Navy,  it would he p&quot;referable to have a prior consultation.    He himself thought this was a matter which should be gone into with the Greeks,SIR PHILIP CUNLIFFE-L18TER said there was a further, question, which was at what point in the contingency mentioned would we be free to use French aerodromes in Southern France?   He pointed out the immense importance of those aerodromes for the delivery of air attacks against Northern Italy.Anti-aircraft MR.  DUFF COOPER and SIR BOLT ON EYRES I.IONSELL (aapminitlbn.little later)    gave particulars of the anti-aircraft ammunition available in the Mediterranean, which was   not sufficient for prolonged operations.      In spite of the efforts made and the success achieved in increasing output,  it would be some months before a reasonably satisfactory position could be reached.(Details lave been attach eel to the C.I.JJ.  fil e^ copy of these Minutes, )
Accel era tlon SIR PHILIP GUITLIPFE-LISTER said that theT^indus trialproduction. &quot; Air Ministry were getting the maximum possibleoutput from every equipped firm, everything that was physically possible was being done. There was no means of accelerating production without turning over to new firms not at present equipped with the necessary machinery.      All aircraft that could be made available had been sent to the Middle East, although doing so had made more difficult the development programme of the Royal Air Force,    At the present time there were 13 squadrons held in reserve in this country, and it would not he possible3 within the next three months,  to increase that numbercA general discussion then took place on the possibilities of accelerating industrial production,  during the course of which it was pointed out that the. Committee had already given sufficient authority to. the War Office to obtain the maximum possible quantity of anti-aircraft ammunition, working within the peace system of production.      That being so, it was urged that the War Office should take steps to bring up production to 180,000 roundsby the 1st April next.      It was pointed out      ___^that the difference between the peace system and war organisation was that if the latter were to
be adopted a number of firms not engaged in the production of a particular commodity in peace would have to turn over to its production, and in order to enable it to do so Government assistance would be required, particularly in the provision of the necessary plant.      Moreover, such firms would have to take on additional skilled labour, of which there was a serious shortage,,    The effects on produeti.cn of turning over to a war organisation, however, would not be felt for  some considerable time and additional output would not quickly be available.  The importance of the machine tool industry was stressed and it was  urged that the sooner    that. industry were informed of big orders coming to them the better it would be.      It was pointed out that,  in any case,  the recommends. -tions of the Defence Requirements Sub-Committee involved-a very great increase all round in industrial production.      A suggestion was made that advantage might be taken of certain-38-recent offers to draw on Germany for anti-aircraft guns and ammunition.      It was pointed out, however,  that we had sufficient numbers of guns and that the Germans would not be able to provide us with ammunition for them.      Their -guns were no good to us as it would introduce great complications in training, and the training of our personnel was a serious limiting factor already.mLorities. The question of priorities was then discussed and itwas pointed out that equipment was being demanded by all three Services.      It was therefore suggested that the Supply Board should investigate the position with particular reference to the emergency at present existing vis-a-vis Italy.This was agreed to.
SIR EDWARD ELLINGTON, in reply to a question, said that our Air Forces in the Middle East were roughly equal to those of Italy in Libya and Eritrea.      Our operations against Italian air forces in the Middle East would take the form of attack on their air bases rather than iriter-ception.      The Italian&apos; air forces in Italy itself, however, presented a different problem, and they could be engaged only by attack from aerodromes in the south of Frence.^o-Ov- SIR PHILIP CUNLIFFE-LISTER said that attack on northern italy from the French southern aerodromes would be  a   vital, Fran^go     factor in.the operations.      Not only were there importantItalian installations in Northern Italy, but such an attack would cause the Italians to divert air forces from other theatres of war and thereby relieve the pressure on Malta and Egypt.      Unless we could operate from Southern France the air offensive would lie in Italy&apos;s hands.      But it was  essen-tial that the French should co-operate- actively,.    We had 13 squadrons earmarked for ultimate despatch^ but only 5 of them would he ready within a period of 14 days,    It was not possible to make a distinction between active French co-opex^ation and her passive permission to use her aerodromes.      Directly we operated from the south of France the French would be in a state of war,  and their army and air force must be ready for that event.      There could, therefore, be no question of our use. of the aerodromes of a sleeping partner.SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL said that naval conversations withbthe French Ministry of Marine had been   had been conducted as noted in the Despatch to Sir George Clerk, and its aimexure, which had been circulated as Paper No. D.P.R.50. The French Naval authorities had said that conversations with the Military and Air Force Staffs would be required, but these had not yet taken place,,      The French Naval authorities had been very frank and friendly during the conversations-6-
but lie was himself by no means convinced that the French would,  in the event,  accept the obligations or put into effect the arrangements agreed to during the discussions with their Naval authorities.SIN SAMUEL HOARS said that it appeared that not only French collaboration would be required, hut also the assistance of other Powers, members of the League,  in the Mediterranean.      The time seemed to be coming when we would have to talk to all these countries, and he thought it advisable that the three Staffs should prepare an appreciation giving their views as to the extent to which these countries could assist in the event of war against Italy.      Approaches to those countries would have to he very careful, hut if an embargo on oil was made,  then we should be entering the danger zone and we should have to face other countries with the risk and see that they were prepared to take their share in collective action.SIR ROBERT VANSITTART reminded the -Committee that the French themselves had suggested discussions between the respective Array and Air Force Staffs.SIR SAMUEL HOARE suggested that the French might be approached in this connection and that Sir George Clerk might be instructed to raise it with LI. Laval.
9 r/SIR ERNLE CHATFIELD said that in the course of the Admiralty Conversations with the French on the subject of naval co-operation,  the French Naval representatives had emphasised the necessity of ensuring complete secrecy as regards the talks and they had extended this desirability to withholding the knowledge from their own Foreign Office0    In fact, when it had appeared from the discussions that no practical assistance could be expected from the French for some weeks after the outbreak of hostilities between Great Britain and Italy,      it had also transpired that the French Naval Authorities did not want to pursue the matter further for the time; again for fear of the existence of these conversations becoming known in France and the consequential repercussions.    They had finally suggested that conversa-tions might be resumed after the London Naval Conference had commenced,,    Opportunity would then be provided for secret talks without any -possibility of this becoming known.    Sir Ernie Ghatfield said that he had accepted this proposition and the French had stated then that they proposed to ssnd over for the Naval conversations their deputy chief of the Naval Staff.    However, yesterday, Vice-Admiral Lurand-Viel informed him that another Naval Officer was coming who actually was not a member of the French Naval staff      This looked to him as if after all the French once again wished to burke the issue.    During the Naval talks the French bad suggested that conversations should not be confined to the Naval problem, but should also take place between the Military and Air&quot;Staffs. Generally, the conversations had brought quite clearly to light the acute anxiety of the French not to become involved in hostilities with Italy.    They were not ready for such a contingency.    For example, the Toulon anti-aircraft defences were not manned.      His conclusion was that tbe
\French were obviously entirely unprepared for airy helpful operations and if they entered the war on our side they would at first he to some extent, a taxrden to us, the only advantage we would gain &quot;being the use of their bases,SIR SAMUEL HOARE said that the issue was whether conversations should now be extended to the Military and Air Staffs and,  if so, whether he should take steps to have this question raised in Paris.SIR ERNLE CHATFIELD emphasised that Vice-Admiral Durand-Viel, while anxious to continue the naval talks,  was equally anxious that these conversations should not take place through the Quai df0nsayo      If they did,  there would be no satisfactory outcome, and French reactions in general to the knowledge of these conversations would queer the pitch.SIR SAMUEL HOARE suggested that perhaps it would be best if the Chief of the Naval Staff wrote to Vice-Admiral Durand-Viel and-suggested that when the naval conversations were resumed during the Naval Conference these should be extended to an exploration by the Military and Air Staffs, though he confessed that there was a risk in carrying these conversations on without M. Laval being concerned in them,SIR ERNLE CHATFIELD pDinted out that the exchange of naval information did   not,   of course,  carry with it any executive,  and while we knew what the French Naval Authorities could do in the event of hostilities it did not ensure that they would be permitted to&quot;carry out the co-operation they envisaged.SIR SAMUEL HOARE said it was for decision whether the
stage had now arrived at which M. Laval should be brought into contact with the issue. Even if the talks wereto be disowned by the Ouai d&apos;Orsay it would be better to know so new. The results might even change our attitude onthe whole policy of sanctions.SIR PHILIP CUmiTFPE-LISTER thought it was very necessary that the conversations should be extended to include the Military and Air Staffs and that M. Laval should be brought face to face with the issue.SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL also agreed with this view.MR. EDEN was of the cpinion that it was now opportune to&quot; go to M,  Laval and suggest that the time had come for the Military and Air Staff conversations which would carry the problem as far as the naval conversations had already gone. He thought that Mo Laval would be prepared to agree to this.MR.  RAMSAY MACDONALD said the danger was that Mo  Laval would agree to these&apos; conversations and would allow them to run on without providing an assurance that there would be authority for their implementation when the time came. We would be then in a position of assuming the material co-operation of Prance on the outbreak of hostilities which, when the moment   came, would not be forthcoming.THE PRIME MINISTER said he had always felt that.France would not come in with us if real trouble  occurred.      Her position vis-;-a--vis Italy in the military sense was impossible and,  financially,  equally so.SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL agreed.        It seemed that firstly there was a strong possibility of an Italian aggression, and secondly, no possibility of French co-operation in such an event. Would it not now be best to try and approach the whole problem from another angle - that of finding ways and means
of improving the general international situation.SIR PHILIP CUNLIFFS-LISTER referred to the decision which had heen taken in the past where it had teen clearly-agreed that no single sanction should be undertaken by this country against Italy unless there was a cut and dried understanding with Prance that in the event of hostilities she would be with us. Row,  even while thepossibility of that co-operation seemed less likely than ever, we were advancing deeper and deeper into sanctions.SIR SAMUEL HOARE pointed out that we had received a clear assurance from Prance that she would co-operate with us, but we were uncertain what was behind that expression of co-operation,SIR JOHN SIMON said that whatever reactions mightbe expected from M.  Laval, it was quite plain that he ought now to be approached so that we might&quot;know preciselywhere we stood.sir ROBERT VANSITTART thought it was conceivable that Prance&apos;s attitude might be changed if a strong lead was given by M.  Laval himself. If we could firstinduce the French to make it clear to the Italians that if Italy went to war with Great Britain France would be with us and the League,  then we would be in a better position to say to France that in view of this categorical statement she ought to take certain defensive steps. The real test of whether the French Government was a Government at all would be proved by the actual steps they then took to provide a concrete defence.      Surely this was something for which we could legitimately ask.SIR SAMUEL HOARE suggested that steps should nowbe taken by Sir George Clerk in Paris to acquaint M. Laval-11-
with our views with the object of inducing him, to make it perfectly clear to Italy that, in the event of hostilities against us arising out of the present dispute, France would automatically and at once give us assistance, and that, consequently, she should now take material steps to ensure that her assistance would be efficient in the military sense.This was generally agreed to.-A*A,^. MR. EDEN raised a point as regards the EgyptianDefenceofHfjgypt. position.    He said it appeared from the discussion that if Port &quot;X&quot; whs occupied no anti-aircraft guns would remain in Egypt.    Was it possible for the- War Office to take any steps to improve this situation?   Could personnel, perhaps, be trained in Egypt on the equipment at present there standing by for Port &quot;x&quot;?MAJOR GENERAL DILL said the difficulty was that the War Office at present had no trained regular units in this country,    New units were under training at the present time and he would go into the question of how soon they would be ready.    He pointed out that with the occupation of Port &quot;X&quot; some defence would still be required for Alexandria and all the anti-aircraft guns referred to would npt be removed from Egypt.    Those left over, however, would be for the defence of the harbour at Alexandria.    It was not a practical proposition, in any case,  to provide adequate anti-aircraft defence for Egypt,SIR ERNLE CHATFISLO informed the Sub-Committee that the Chiefs of Staff had lately directed the three Commanders-&apos; in-Chief in the Mediterranean to prepare a combined appreciation on the defence of Egypt.    This was to be expected shortly,MAJOR GENERAL DILL said it was anticipated that the combined appreciation would leave Egypt on 1st December, i -12-
ppjnforcements SIR PHILIP CUNLIFFE-LISTER referred to the existencefor Aden andjjggfifs of one &quot;bomber squadron still in Iraq which was earmarked for Aden and also to the battalion earmarked in India which it had been agreed should be sent, to Aden should the situation deteriorate. It might be possible to come toa final decision on the disposal of this squadron andhi &apos; &apos;. i I -      \h&quot;;battalion now.SIR SAMUEL HOARE said that,  in his view,  the more important problem at the moment was the defence of Egypt. He would like&apos; to see the further mobile force sent to that country to provide the requisite defence in the neighbour-hood of Sollum.MAJ OR-GENERAL DILL said the additional forces Which had been earmarked for the defence of Egypt were at a month&apos;s notice in this country.      The appreciation from the Commanders-in-Chief on the spot was certain to ask for the despatch of these additional forces and there was no doubt that if risk of invasion existed these forces should be in Egypt before the crisis arose.SIR SAMUEL HOARE said he would certainly like to see the mobile part of these reinforcements sent out soon,    and   if the    view   was    taken   that    the situation now was more dangerous than it had been,  then the despatch should take place at once.        The additional infantry brigade&apos;s despatch did not seem of such immediate importance.MAJOR-GENERAL DILL informed the Sub-Committee that the strength of the mobile force was approximately 50 light tanks,.15 medium tanks, 1 mechanised artillery brigade and an armoured car unit.MR.   RAMSAY MACDONALD said he would prefer that this-13-
force&apos;was not moved until the last moment.        He had understood that the necessity for this force only arose if there was reasonable fear of an attack from Libya and he was not sure that this fear was sufficiently justified at present.SIR SAMUEL HOARE spoke of the value of this mobile force as a deterrent to any mad act in Libya by Italy. Politically,  there would be very serious repercussions in Alexandria if Italy attacked and had her own way.THE PRIME MINISTER said it was a question of whether the despatch of these additional forces would act as a deterrent or as a provocation.SIR SAMUEL HOARE was of the opinion that it would prove a deterrent. He reminded the Sub-Committeethat in the detente conversations Signor Mussolini had always accepted the fact that we might reinforce Egypt within reasonable limits.It was generally agreed that while the despatch of the further infantry brigade to Egypt was not for the moment necessary,  the mobile force referred, to should be sent as soon as possible, in anticipation of the apprecia-tion from the Commanders-in-Chief requiring these re-inforcements.SIR PHILIP CUNLIPPE-LISTER returned to the subjectof Aden and said that while agreeing that it would notbe necessary at present to send the additional bombersquadron there, reinforcement by the battalion from india was on a different footing.      The troops were requiredto maintain order in Aden should it he subjected to air attack,  and he was reluctant to take the risk of posH^^aingthe despatch of this force in the light of present conditx^ons,-14-v A
MR.   RAMSAY MACIKiNAID uttered a word of caution as to any assumption that Italy was likely to embark on some rash act and thought, generally,  that the discussion had taken too much account of that possibility. A wider viewshould be taken of the causes of the situation and its likely evolution.        These reinforcing movements cost money and would have a deleterious moral effect.        If they continued they might, in the end,  become provocative.        If and when sanctions had driven Italy into a corner she would look for   excuses,    and our provocative movements might provide the reasons in her mind;,SIR SAMUEL HOARE did not take the-view that a mad dog- act was likely; but he did not think that the movement of one battalion to a -place such as Aden would give a provocative impression.MR.- MALCOLM MACDOHALD wondered whether it would not be possible,  in taking these reinforcing steps at Aden,  to do the same as had been done at Malta and point out that this additional force was only raising the Aden garrison to its proper peace complement.SIR PHILIP CUNLIPPE-LISTER pointed out that one company of the battalion referred to was already at Addis Ababa and perhaps it might be possible to suggest that the despatch of the further three companies to Aden was only bringing support closer to our interests in the Abyssinian capital.MR.  MALCOLM MACDONALD suggested that it might be of advantage if the Foreign Office was consulted as regards the issue of some communique to explain the reinforcement of the Aden garrison.
MR.  MALCOLM MACDONALD informed the Sub-Committeethat as regards plans forthe evacuation of women andchildren from Malta and Aden, there were now no shipsactually standing by for this purpose,  and he thought itwould he advisable to look again into the question of thesupply of transports if the situation deteriorated.THE PRIME MINISTER said that this general authority had already &quot;been given,  and stated that the position shouldbe kept constantly under review and brought up to the Sub-Committee whenever this was considered desirable.CONCLUSIONS.THE SUBCOMMITTEE agreed :-(a) That the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committeeshould advise as to the nature of the naval, military and air assurances which we ought to obtain frem Mediterranean Powers, Members of the League, to safe-guard the situation in the event of an aggression by Italy.(b) (i)    That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should take up with the French Government the question of practical collaboration with His Majesty&apos;s Government.    It was proposed that after Sir George Clerk had asked M. Laval to inform Signor Mussolini that wrar with His Majesty&apos;s Government meant war with&apos;France,  and, after this had been done, M.  Laval should, be asked to implement this affirmation by concrete action (e.g.,  that the air defences  of Southern France should be manned;    otherwise the assurances already given in regard to the use of Toulon would be valueless),    At the same time M.  Laval should be asked to further the naval conversations already begun,  and to begin the air and military conversations which he himself had fore-seen.      This procedure would supply the practical test whether the French Government were able, or unable - as has been suspected -tfo implement their recognised obligations of practical and. effective collaboration.(ii)    To take note of a despatch from the Foreign Office to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris on the recent Anglo-French Naval Conversations (Paper No. D. P. R.  50),.
To approve the proposals for the defence of Egypt put forward by the War Office in Paper Ho. D.P.E,  55.To authorise the War Office to despatch to Egypt as soon as possible the mobile forces considered necessary for the defence against Italian attack from Lib ya,-i.e.One Light Tank Battalion; One Company of Medium Tanks; One Mechanised Field ArtilleryBrigade ^ Armoured Car Unit and ancillary Troops.To ask the War Office to consider what steps can be tasien to improve the A.A. defences in Egypt in the event of a move of the Main Fleet from Alexandria.To authorise the air Ministry to approach the India Office with a view to the latter taking the necessary steps to put into effect the arrangements for the move of a battalion (less one Company already at Addis Ababa) from India to Aden.That the question of evacuation of families from Malta and Aden was a matter which should be kept constantly under review by the Departments concerned, especially in respect of the availability of shipping at short noti ce.That the war Office had already sufficient authority to take all steps for acceleration-ting to the maximum,, within the normal peace system, the production of anti-aircraft ammunit ion3That  the Supply Board should advise as to the priority in supply to be given to the main items of Service requirements in the event of a possible aggression by Italy, and report- at the earliest possible moment.(i) (ii)(iii)
S.        FUTURE SITUATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN.THE SUB-COMMITTEE then had under consideration a Memorandum hy the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee giving consideration to the situation arising for each Service if the present position in the Mediterranean continued (Paper No. D.P. Re  51),  and also a Note by the First Lord of the Admiralty covering a Memorandum by the Chief of the Naval Staff    on the specific question of naval leave arrangements (Paper No.  D.P.R.  53 )vSIR ERNLE CHATFIELD said that the general conclusions arrived at by the Chiefs of Staff were detailed on pages 5 and 6 of Paper Noc D, P. R*  51.        Difficulties had arisen because the Services were on a war footing without mobilisation, and the Chiefs of Staff were anxious to receive approval to take certain steps to overcome administrative and personnel problems. Some of these steps required immediate approval,while others were consequential. The ultimate result of taking these steps would be some weakening of our strength in the Mediterranean, but this must be accepted if the welfare of the personnel and the efficiency of the Services as a whole was to be maintained.SIR SAMUEL HOARE said that while he had no objections to the proposals put forward by the Chiefs of Staff,- and he appreciated the difficulties which faced the Services, he hoped that the Services would carry out their programmes always keeping in mind that the situation would be very delicate for the next few weeks. The less that could bedone to weaken our state of readiness the better.SIR ERNLE CHATFIELD pointed out that the proposals contained in the Memorandum did not involve bringing Home any ships from,the Mediterranean until next January.
