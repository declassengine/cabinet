m &amp;THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,Secret. 1CP.190(35)o CABINET. Copy No. $ ^Unemployment Benefit Allovjances for Children.Note by the Minister of Labour.The Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee reported last July that the Unemployment Fund had a disposable surplus (of about  l4nu a year) sufficient to enable the benefit allowances for dependent children to be increased from 2/- to 3/- and recommended that this should be done.     Under Section 59 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1955 I am required to lay before Parliament, as soon as it meets, the Committee&apos;s Report together vrith a draft Order making this increase (or else spending the surplus in some other way). Resolutions passed by both Houses are required before the Order can come into effect.A copy of the Committee&apos;s Report is circulated herewith.I assume that my colleagues will agree that the Committee&apos;s recommendation should be adopted.     As regards the date at which it is to come into operation, however, a point of considerable difficulty arises owing to reactions on the Unemployment Assistance Scheme.Under the Standstill arrangements now operative for unemployment assistance, applicants receive, as a minimum, the rate of assessment for transitional payments.     If the benefit allowance for children is increased by l/- this will automatically increase the maximum for transitional payments by the same amount, and though this maximum would not be paid in all cases, the effect would be a fortuitous increase of anything up to  750,000 per annum, payable only to those families who are already in receipt of more than the Regulation provides.     Moreover, such an increase in the level of assistance would make it even more difficult than it is already to liquidate the Standstill,,lo
58The only way of preventing the increase in children&apos;s allowances from applying to the assistance rates is by amending legislation, which, if time permitted, would have formed part of the steps necessary for putting right the assistance position generally.     As things are, however, I assume that no such legislation will be possible this session.The alternative which, after careful consideration, I think we should adopt is to postpone the actual operation of the increase in the benefit allowances.     This can be done by holding back the resolution necessary for putting the Order into effect.     The postponement need not be for longer than a few weeks and I shall propose to tell the House that while we wish to make the increase as soon as possible and intend to do so at the earliest opportunity, there are at present so many complicated inter-actions between any such change and the Standstill arrangements that it is necessary to deal with these two matters together and not in isolation from one another.In their Report the Committee incidentally recommend that there should be a maximum of 41/- to the weekly amount of benefit in any case.     There is a good deal of difficulty about this and the Chancellor and I have not yet been able to reach a conclusion as to whether it should be accepted.      I should be glad therefore if my colleagues would authorise me to settle this point of detail with the Chancellor, and subject to this to proceed as I propose.E. B.11th October, 1955.

UNEMPLOYMENT  INSURANCE   STATUTORY committee report on the Financial Condition of the Unemployment Fund, July, 1935To the Rt. Hon. Ernbst Brown, M.P., Minister of Labour.Sir,Reference, Procedure, and Relation to First Report.By Section 59 (1) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1935, we are required to make a report on the financial condition of the Unemployment Fund at least once in each year. We may in our discretion make a further report at any time. If, in making any report, we conclude that the fund is or is likely to become, and is likely to continue to be, insufficient to discharge its liabilities, or is and is likely to continue to be more than reasonably sufficient to discharge its liabilities, then by Section 59 (2) of the Act it is our duty to recommend such changes in the rates of contribution or in the rates or conditions of benefit as, in our opinion, are required to&apos; make the fund sufficient or no more than reasonably sufficient to discharge its liabilities.In presenting, on 25th February last, our first report under Section 59 (1) on the financial condition of the Unemployment Fund on 31st December, 1934, we intimated our intention to make a further report before the end of June, 1935. In accordance with Section 59 (3) we gave on 16th April, 1935, formal notice of our intention to make this report. We have received and considered representations in respect thereto from various bodies and have taken oral evidence from the following :  National Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations. Parliamentary Committee of the Co-operative Congress. Trades Union Congress General Council.Standing Joint Committee of Industrial Women&apos;s Organisa-tions.National Council for Equal Citizenship. ,National Council. of Women.     ,National Women Citizens&apos; Association. ,London and National Society for Women&apos;s Service. , Women&apos;s National Liberal Federation,    ..Open Door Council. , tj ..:   .We have had the. advantage. also of discussion with Mr. H. D. Henderson,;on behalf of the Economic Advisory Council, and with representatives of H.M.; Treasury. The full, consideration..which we desired to give to these various representations has&apos; made it impossible to complete our report till- a few days after the end of June.
In presenting this second report, it will be convenient to begin by recalling certain&apos;salient points of our earlier report, as an indica-tion of the lines on which we consider it our duty to proceed.First, we emphasised in our first report the importance of avoid.-ing continual changes in the rates of benefit, and, to a less extent&apos;, in the conditions of benefit and the rates of contribution. &quot; To cut down in an ordinary trade depression the protection against unemployment, because the fund is not solvent, is an admission of failure in insurance. To raise the rates of contribution in a depression is only a little less undesirable ; it means adding to the burdens of industry just when the chance of early recovery from depression depends on a lightening of the burdens.&quot; From this it follows that, in deciding at any moment whether the fund is and is likely to continue to be insufficient or more than reasonably sufficient to meet its liabilities, the relation of income and expendi-ture at that moment or for a few months ahead, is not the most important consideration. We have to look, on the one hand, at the balancing point of income and expenditure on any given basis of contributions and benefits, that is to say the rate of unem-ployment at which the expenditure of the fund may be expected to equal its income, without excess or deficiency; in saying that, on any given basis of contributions and benefits, the fund appears likely to continue to be either insufficient or more than reasonably sufficient for its liabilities, we shall, in effect, be expressing the opinion that the average rate of unemployment over a normal trade cycle is likely to exceed or not to exceed the balancing point on that basis. We have to look, on the other hand, at the size of the reserve which it is necessary to accumulate in advance of a trade depression, in order to avoid lowering benefits or raising con-tributions; under Section 60 of the Act, the powers of borrowing to meet a deficiency are strictly circumscribed. In our first report we adopted provisionally, as the standard reserve to be aimed at on any given basis of contributions and benefits, half the loss that would have been incurred in the worst depression yet experienced, that of 1930 to 1933. We made it clear at the time that this standard was provisional; in the light of further experience it may appear possible and preferable to calculate the reserve required upon a different basis.Second, we described in the following terms, the external and the internal factors which affect the financial working of unemploy-ment insurance.&quot; Given the rates of contribution and rates and conditions of benefit, the financial working of the Unemployment Fund depends on several factors, of which one is external to the scheme, while the others are internal. The external factor is the&apos; course of industrial activity, in its widest sense, and the resulting t6tal volume or rate of unemployment. The internal factors are the reactions of. the various elements in the scheme  contribution income,  expenditure on benefits,  and other
.; ill hM--&apos;Aexpenditure to the external factor, that is to the rate of unemployment. In order to say, at any time, whether the Unemployment Fund is, and is likely to continue to be, either insufficient or more than reasonably sufficient to discharge its liabilities, it is necessary, in the light of any available data, to make assumptions both as to the external and as to the internal factors. It is necessary to make assumptions, on the one hand, as to the future course of unemployment; on the other hand, as to how contribution income, benefit expenditure, and other expenditure will be affected by a change in the rate of unemployment &quot;.Third, we pointed out the difficulties involved in any estimate of the external factor and the short experience available last February for judging of the internal factors. This was our reason for postponing till a later time any attempt to give a considered judgment on the sufficiency or insufficiency of the Unemployment Fund as now established. This caution has been justified by events..At the date to which our first report referred, experience of unemployment insurance on the new basis established by the Act of 1934 was limited to five months, from August to December, 1934. We had to judge the various internal factors of the scheme, most of which aie affected materially by seasons, without having a full run of seasons before us. In respect of the external factor, we could not at that time do more than make the statistical assumption that unemployment during 1935. would maintain the general level reached in December, 1934, subject only to normal seasonal fluotua-tion, so that unemployment in December, 1935, would be the same as twelve months before. On this statistical assumption, we showed that in addition to about  10,500,000 in hand at the end of 1934, the fund might expect to accumulate in 1935 a surplus of  10,500,000 and thus have a balance of  21,000,000 altogether at the end of the year.Experience since First Report.In several ways, the experience of the Unemployment Fund since the date of our first report has been less favourable than was assumed in this calculation.First, from December to January there was a set-back in the process of recovery. Over and above the increase of unemployment which is normal at that season, there was an additional increase of something like 1 per cent., and, allowing for seasonal fluctuation, this higher level of unemployment was substantially maintained through February and March. In April there was an improve-ment and the improvement was maintained in May. But, even at the end of May, unemployment, after allowing for the season, was above the level of December, 1934. Over the first five months of 1935 the unemployment percentage has averaged 16-4, as corn-pared with 15-7 assumed in pur first report.30593 A 2
Second, the percentage of unemployment ranking for benefit, which was taken as 46-4, in accordance with&apos;the experience of five months August-December, 1934, has averaged 47-4 over the ten months August, 1934-May, 1935. If the percentage of 47-4 experienced in August, 1934-May, 1935 is fair for the ten months as a whole, the percentage for twelve months must be put higher; the seasonal movement of textiles and mining normally makes the percentage in June and July above the average for the year. In preparing a revised estimate for the year 1935, accordingly, the percentage of unemployment ranking for benefit has been put at 48-0..Third, the weekly cost of each claim to benefit has been unexpectedly higher in the ten months than in the five months. The average weekly payment has been  -858 (about 17s. 2d.) from August, 1934, to May, 1935, as compared with  -852 (about 17s. OJd.) from August to December, 1934. As was explained in our first report, the average cost of each claim is affected by the proportions of men, women and young persons and also by the proportions of &quot; wholly unemployed &quot; and &quot; temporarily stopped and casual workers &quot; respectively among the unemployed. Through seasonal or other influences there appears to have been an increase since the date of that report in the proportion of those &quot;wholly unemployed.&quot; In making a revised estimate for 1935, it seems necessary to take the higher figure of . -858.In all three respects the rate of unemployment, the proportion ranking for benefit, and the average cost of each payment  experience since the beginning of 1935 has been less favourable than our assumptions. Allowance for the second and third of these influences makes the balancing point of income and expenditure on the present basis of contribution and benefit 18-1 per cent, of unemployment, in place of 18-7 per cent., and the standard reserve required by the Fund  16,500,000 in place of  13,250,000, as given on pages 12 and 13 of our first report.The combined result of all three influences is to make the present balance of the Unemployment Fund materially below our expecta-tions. During January and February the expenditure of the fund exceeded its income, and though substantial weekly surpluses are now being realised, the nett addition to the balance of the Fund in the first six months of 1935 can hardly be much in excess of  3,500,000. On seasonal grounds the second half of the year is normally more profitable than the first half, but the prospect of realising during 1935 the surplus of  10,500,000 mentioned as possible in our first report is now all but excluded.Revised Estimate for 1935.In one other respect we are to-day not as well placed as last February we had hoped to be. In our first report we pointed out that, before we could jjropose either to reduce the income or increase the expenditure of the Unemployment Fund, we had to
make an assumption as to the future rate of unemployment, not only in the near future, but over a period of years. It appeared necessary to seek the best possible advice on this matter. Since we made our first report, the best way of obtaining this advice has been under discussion and it has now been arranged that the Economic Advisory Council through its Committee on Economic Information should make an investigation and should assist us in coming to a conclusion on this, extremely difficult subject. We have also had. the great advantage of learning from Mr. H. D. Henderson the views of the Committee on Economic Information as to the immediate future. We desire to express our appreciation of the invaluable help that is thus being placed at our disposal by His M!ajesty&apos;s Government.But investigation of the remoter prospects of unemployment over a period of years will necessarily take some time ; we cannot look for any results from this investigation till the autumn. To-day we are compelled below to deal with this matter in the light of our own knowledge and on our own responsibility. In judging of the immediate future, we are better placed through our discussion with Mr. H. D. Henderson. We make our revised estimate of the financial working of the Unemployment Tund during 1935 largely in the light of his observations, as summed up in the following note.&quot; Mr. Henderson said that he represented the general views of the Committee on Economic Information. They thought that the trend of economic activity for some months ahead would be upwards. The apprehensions of a set-back which had been felt in the early months of the year had disappeared. All the evidence went to show that it would require a very substantial reversal of present tendencies if employment were not to show an improvement during the next few months. He was unable to say how long the improvement would last, since it was governed by many factors.   As regards the rate. of improvement, he was perhaps slightly pessimistic; up to date the improvement had occurred mainly in the home market and there had been only a slight improvement in the export trade. So far as exports were concerned he was not very hopeful so far as the present year was concerned. Mr. Henderson pointed out that the export trades were seriously affected by international influences. On balance he was not particularly hopeful that the export trade would be likely to improve materially. If exports did improve this would be much more effective in reducing unemployment than an improvement in the internal market. This point was particularly important in connection with the problem before the Statutory Committee since an improvement in the export trades would absorb large numbers of unemployed workers who were already available for work, whereas in the home market we had nearly reached the point where expansion30593 A.&quot;
i8Would, be retarded by shortages of certain types of labour. The vie&apos;w of the Committee on Economic Information might be summarised by saying that further improvement was likely in the next six months, but that as far as the unemployment figures were concerned the extent of the improvement would probably be less than that of 1933-34.&quot;Mr. Henderson&apos;s expectation of the upward trend of economic activity, at least for the remainder of 1935, was confirmed in the &quot;representations made to us on behalf of the National Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations.IJn the light of this expectation we have prepared two revised estimates for the year 1935. The first of these revised estimates (A) is based on the assumption that during the remaining seven months of 1935 unemployment remains at the same level as in May, 1935, subject only to normal seasonal fluctuations. On this assumption, the average rate of unemployment over the whole of 1935 will be 16-22 per cent., as compared with 16-64 per cent, in 1934. The other, more optimistic, assumption (B) is that unemployment in the last seven months of the calendar year will bear the same relation to that of the first five months in 1935 as it did in 1934. On this assumption, the average rate of unemploy-ment over the whole of 1935 will be 15-82 per cent.Tabke I. Financial Working of Unemployment Fund. (Expenditure, Income, and Surplus, in  1,000.)

These two revised estimates are set out in the last two columns of Table I where they can be compared with the experiences of August-December, 1934, and August, 1934-May, 1935, and with the estimate in our first Report. On Estimate A, the Fund has a surplus during 1935 of  6,864,000, making its accumulated balance at the end of the year  17,391,000. On Estimate B, the surplus during 1935 is  8,736,000, and the balance at the end of the year is  19,263,000.If either of these figures is realised, the Unemployment Fund, at the end of 1935, will have more than the standard reserve required on its present basis, and, unless there is then a sharp unfavourable turn of trade, will be continuing to add to its balance. This prospect makes it hard for us, on a fair view of the most likely course of events, to hold that the income of the fund is no more than reasonably sufficient to discharge its liabilities. But before coining to a definite conclusion on this issue it is necessary to look also at the remoter prospects. This we do, as has been stated, on our own responsibility and not on that of the Committee on Economic Information.Survey of Remoter Prospects and Conclusion as to Continuing Surplus.The balancing point on the present basis of contributions and benefits is 18&apos;1 per cent, of unemployment. The average unemploy-ment in the last five years 1930-1934 has been 19 per cent. ; in the last ten years 1925-1934 it has been 14&apos;9 per cent. In considering whether it is possible to propose any substantial change of con-tributions and benefits, the crucial question is whether and to what extent we can treat the experience of years before the great depres-sion which began in 1930 as applicable to the future? If we can bring into account the years before the depression and can take as the average rate of unemployment to be expected in the future the average of 14&quot;9 per cent, experienced in the last ten years/the Unemployment Fund, on its present basis, has a surplus income of more than  12,000,000 a year. This would be nearly enough, if no other change were made, to take 2d. a week off the contributions of each party to insurance; alternatively it would be enough to make improvements in rates of benefit greater than any which have been proposed to us.Facts forbid us to budget for the Unemployment Fund on this basis or to count on any early return to the levels of unemployment recorded before the depression of 1931-32. The reasons are illus-trated in the two charts which We print below.The first chart shows the percentage of insured persons in employ-ment each month from 1921 to the present time; that is to say, it shows the unemployment percentage reversed, so that a high point on the curve represents relative prosperity and a low point xlepres-sion. The depression of 192H, with the employed percentage for a few months below 80, was nearly as deep, though not nearly so
idlong, as that of 1931-32. From 1921 there was a rapid recovery till a level of nearly 90 per cent, employed (10 per cent, unemployed) was reached in 1924 and, apart from the dispute year 1926, this level was maintained nearly to the end of 1929. The employed per-centage fell once more below 80 in 1931 and 1932 ; from that depres-sion the recovery has not been nearly so fast either as the decline during 1930 or as the recovery from 1921. Moreover the rate of recovery is slowing down ; it was less in 1934 than in 1933, and on present tendencies seems likely to be less in 1935 than in 1934. The curve of the employment percentage shows signs of flattening out long before it has risen to the level of 90 per cent, ruling before the depression ; on px-esent tendencies it seems unlikely to pass 85.&apos; One reason for this is obvious, and is made explicit in the second chart.This second chart shows the employment percentage, the volume of industrial production, in Britain and the volume of British exports, since 1924, equated in each case to 100 for the year 1929. The relative extents of depression and recovery in each case can thus be compared. Industrial production, it will be seen, fell from its starting point of 100 in 1929 to 83 in 1932 and has returned to the 1929 level or above it. But exports fell much more, from 100 to 63 in 1931, and have recovered only to 70 in 1934. With so many of our industries and our people specialised for exports, we cannot hope for any early return to pre-depression levels of unem-ployment, except by return to something much nearer to the pre-depression level of overseas trade. Production for new demands in the home market may absorb new entrants to industry, but transference of men from the export industries to meet such demands is a slow and difficult process. The depression of 1931-32 has left behind it a legacy of disordered currencies and trade restric-tions, and has transformed the character of our problem.If, without a complete change in the international economic situation, we cannot look for an early return to pre-depression levels of employment, what can we look for? What should we take as the most probable limits of downward and upward movement in the next cycle? Till we get the results of the enquiry now being con-ducted at our request by the Economic Advisory Council, we cannot do more than state the assumptions that seem most reasonable on the facts now before us.On the one hand, the flattening out of the employment curve suggests that we should not count on its rising above an average of 85 for any year, that is to say, we should take 15 per cent, of unemployment as the probable minimum in a good year, as coni-pared with 10 per cent, before the depression.On the other hand, it would be wrong to suppose that, because in the last depression unemployment increased by 12 per cent, from about 10 per cent, to nearly 22 per cent., there is likely to be- an equal increase, say from 15 per cent, to 27 per.cent, in the next depression. The moderate decline of unemployment since the depression of 1931-32 is obviously the resultant of two movements 
a relatively great recovery in trades making for the home market and a barely perceptible recovery in trades making for export. The former trades, having become prosperous, may relapse again ; the latter, not having recovered, cannot relapse. The fluctuation of employment as between good years and bad should be much less than that represented by the difference between 10 per cent, and 22 per cent. It is legitimate, indeed, to go farther than this and to assume that British industry is gradually adapting itself to condi-tions of greater economic nationalism; labour in the depressed export industries is being transferred; the older men are retiring without being replaced. To look for a maximum of unemployment slightly less, rather than more, than the maximum of the last depression, say 21 per cent, in place of 22 per cent., is not unduly optimistic.On this basis, an imaginary but plausible construction of the probable course of unemployment can be made. We may assume, for instance, the following succession of unemployment percent-ages, in a cycle of eight years; 19-8, 16-6, 16-0, 15-0, 16-5, 17-5, 19-0, 21-0. The first two figures are the recorded percentages for 1933 and 1934, the third is the mean of our two estimates for 1935; the fourth is the assumed minimum of 15-0, followed by a gradual rise to the assumed maximum of 21-0. The mean of the eight percentages is 17-7.This is an imaginary construction, but we are bound to make such a construction, since without it we cannot perform our financial duties in respect of the Unemployment Fund. It is put forward, not as a prophecy of what will happen in the next six years, but as a concrete way of stating the assumptions on which it appears most reasonable to base the finance of the insurance scheme. Given the figures of minimum and maximum unemploy-ment (assumed as 15 per cent, and 21 per cent.), the general result, that is to say the average over all years, is not affected greatly by any reasonable change in the other assumptions, e.g., by dropping one of the intermediate years to make a seven year cycle, or by adding a year to make a nine year cycle, or by putting individual percentages up or down.The approximate level, indeed, of the average for all 3&quot;ears can almost be deduced from the minimum and maximum alone. This average will be near to but definitely below, the point midway between minimum and maximum. It is a characteristic of unem-ployment in the trade cycle, as recorded before the war, that the depression is more concentrated than the prosperity, so that the average over the cycle as a whole is nearer to the prosperity, that is to say to the minimum of unemployment than it is to the maxi-mum. In the 55 years for which trade union returns of unemployment are available before the war, -there are seven fairly definite cycles. The seven boom years (1860, 1865, 1872, 1882, 1889, 1899, 1906) have a mean unemployment of 2-1 per cent.; the seven depression years (1862, 1868, 1879, 1886, 1893, 1904,
1908) have a mean of 8-0 per cent. The mid-point of these minima and maxima is thus 5-0 per cent. The average for all the 55 years is 4-4 per cent., near to but definitely below the mid-point between minima and maxima. There is no reason&apos; for supposing that changes of monetary structure since the war, what-ever their other effects, have changed this feature of the unem-ployment cycle. Since the war, the best year (1927) has an unem-ployment percentage of 9-6 while the worst year (1932) has a percentage of 21-9. The mean of these two figures is 15 - 7; the average for ten years 1925-34 (including 1927 and 1932) is 14-9 and the average for eight years 1927-1934 is 15 -1  in either case near to but definitely below the mid-point of minimum and maximum. Given the starting points of 15-0 per cent, as minimum and 21-0 per cent, as maximum, an average a little below 18-0 per cent. something in the neighbourhood of 17-5 per cent.  is almost certain to emerge.The average of 17-7 per cent, resulting from the figures taken is as likely to be right as any other estimated figure near it. Since the balancing point of the Unemployment Fund on its present basis is 18-1 per cent., acceptance of 17-7 per cent, as the rate of unemployment over a period of years amounts to saying that the fund on its present basis is likely to have a continuing surplus. It defines at the same time the scale of that surplus, as1 something less than  1,500,000 a year.We are of opinion, accordingly, in the. terms of Section 59 (2) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1935, that, on its present basis, the Unemployment Fund is and is likely to continue to be more than reasonably sufficient to discharge its liabilities. Having reported this, it is our duty to propose amendments in the insurance scheme with a view to making the fund no more than reasonably sufficient. Before making our own proposals, it is necessary to describe the powers under which we act and to define our atti-tude to various proposals that have been placed before us by parties interested in the scheme.Powers and Policy of Committee in Recommending Changes.Section 59 (2) of the Unemployment Insurance Act of 1935 is as follows : (2) If the Committee at any time report that the Unemploy-ment Fund is or is likely to become, and is likely to continue to be, insufficient to discharge its liabilities, or is and is likely to continue to be more than reasonably sufficient to discharge its liabilities, the report shall contain -(a) recommendations for the amendment, either generally or in relation to special classes of insured con-distributors, of the provisions of this Act referred to in the Fifth Schedule to this Act or of the provisions of any previous order made under this section, being such aniend-ihents as in the opinion of the Committee are required in order to make the fund, as&apos;the case may be, sufficient or
no more than reasonably sufficient to discharge its liabilities; and(b) an estimate of the effect which the amendments recommended will have on the financial condition of the fund ;and, where the Committee report that the fund is and is likely to continue to be more than reasonably sufficient to discussed-charge its liabilities, the report may contain recommendations for the application of any sum towards the discharge of the liabilities mentioned in subsection (2) of the next following section of this Act.On receipt of a report and recommendations under this sub-section, the Minister of Labour, in addition to laying the report itself before Parliament, is required, within two months, to lay before Parliament an order either giving effect to the specific recommendations in the report or making such other amendments of the scheme, &quot; as will in his opinion have substantially the same effect on the financial condition of the Unemployment Fund &quot; as that estimated in the report to be the effect of the recommendations made there. When the Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee have named a figure as the estimated effect of their recommendations, the Minister of Labour and every other authority short of Parliament is bound by that figure. The Minister is not bound by the specific.recommendations of the Committee for reaching that figure, but if he departs from them he must give his reasons to Parliament. Resolutions passed by both: Houses of Parliament are sufficient to give statutory force to the recommen-dations submitted.This section accordingly provides for variation of the Unemploy-ment Insurance scheme without fresh legislation and formally the power of variation is very wide. The provisions included in the Fifth Schedule, as subject to variation by order under section 59, include, not only the ordinary rates of benefit and contributions, but all the rates applicable to particular classes, all the statutory conditions and disqualifications for benefit, and even the Anomalies section imposing special conditions on receipt of benefit by married women, seasonal workers and others. On a wide reading of our powers, we could propose under section 59 to re-introduce the &quot; genuinely seeking work &quot; condition abolished by the Act of 1929 or to make the contributions of employers and workmen unequal; almost the only important power not. formally covered by the Fifth Schedule is that of making the Exchequer contribution other than half the joint contribution of the other parties. But these wide powers are all governed, by the condition that any amend-ments proposed under section 59 must be such as in our opinion &quot; are required to make the fund sufficient or no more than reason-ably sufficient to discharge&apos; its liabilities.&quot;
uHaving regard to this, we do not believe that it would be proper for us, under the guise of a financial adjustment, to propose changes in the scheme, however desirable we might think them to be, the financial consequences of which would be so small as to have no appreciable effect towards making the fund either sufficient or no more than reasonably sufficient to discharge its liabilities. A number of minor changes advocated before us by the Trades Union Congress General Council for paying benefit to men engaged for work but never set to work, for paying benefit to men while await-ing decision on a workmen&apos;s compensation claim, for giving dependants allowance to an unmarried housekeeper when there are no children, and for continuing children.&apos;s allowances during con-tinued education after sixteen fall in this category. Changes of this character should, we believe, be proposed in our report on finance only if they are consequential on some larger change.There is another class of amendment formally within our power under Section 59 which we exclude from present consideration on slightly different grounds. This is the removal or amendment of the additional conditions imposed upon certain classes of persons under Section 55 of the Act, the Anomalies section. One of the associations representative of women&apos;s interests which appeared before us to argue that, under the unemployment insurance scheme, injustice is done to women as a sex, emphasised particularly the special conditions applied to married women by the Anomalies Orders and urged that the removal of these special conditions had the first call on any surplus in the fund. The cost of this&apos; proposal would be two or three times the surplus which we have at our disposal. But, quite apart from this, there are reasons which, in our view, make it inappropriate for us to consider it on the present Occasion.The special conditions affecting married women, seasonal workers and a few other classes under Section 55 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, T9S5, are,imposed, not directly.by that section,,but by Anomalies Orders made in pursuance of it. Section 55 itself provides specific procedure for the variation of these Orders by resolution of both Houses of Parliament,, after, report by ourselves on a draft amending Order submitted to us. by the Minister of Labour. Section 57 of the Act moreover, authorises the Minister of Labour to refer any question to us for consideration and advice. Under Section 57 we have before us at this moment another branch of the Anomalies Orders, that relating to seasonal workers. It would clearly be inappropriate if, in place of acting on this reference and considering subsequently, under Section 55 any draft Order re-ferred to us, we now proposed in pur financial report: a change of Section 55, involving abolition or drastic change of the Orders re-lating to seasonal workers. I/n fact, at almost the same time as that of this report under Section 59, on the direct reference to us under Section 57 of the problem of seasonal workers, we are sug-suggesting a number of changes that will: increase expenditure on
benefit. The possibility that some or all of those suggestions may be adopted is one of the contingent liabilities of the fund which we take into account in reporting on the financial condition of the fund. But we make these suggestions as to; seasonal workers after specific reference of the problem to us, and after notice to all interested parties.The same argument applies to the Anomalies Orders in respect of married women. Where the Act prescribes specific procedure for dealing with a particular question, as it does for anomalies, amendments of principle should in practice be considered and made by that procedure.It should be added that the Anomalies Orders themselves cannot be - varied directly under the Fifth Schedule. The power given by that schedule is a power to amend, not the Anomalies Orders themselves, but Section 55 of the Act under which the Orders are made. An amendment of Section 55 deleting part of it, say sub-section 2 id) referring to married women, by cutting away the legal basis of the corresponding portion of the Anomalies Orders would in effect repeal them. An amendment which left sub-section 2 id)&apos;, while varying its scope or effect, would produce an awkward or even an impossible legal situation, which could only be put right by making, under the procedure of Section 55, a new Order to correspond with the altered statutory provision. This is an added reason for considering that amendment of the Anomalies provisions should normally be undertaken only under Section 55 and not as part of a financial adjustment under Section 59.This does not mean that the power expressly conferred by the Fifth Schedule to vary Section 55 should under no circumstances be exercised. We can conceive circumstances under which this power might and should be used. But it should not in our opinion be regarded as a normal procedure and in no case should, it be used to bring about any important change of the Anomalies pro-visions, either in favour of claimants or against them, without express notice that the matter is under consideration, so that representations, from one side or another, may be made upon it&apos;.Still less do we mean that, in making our financial report under Section 59, we are precluded from considering the merits of various proposals for improving the working of the Insurance Scheme. In making recommendations either for the allocation of a surplus or for the meeting of a deficiency, we are bound to discuss questions of principle affecting the working of the scheme. But our first approach must be financial : that of considering the best use to make of a given sum of money and not that of passing annually in review the working of the insurance scheme in all its details.
Principal Representations made to Committee.Approaching the matter from the financial angle, the principal representations made to us may be put in three groups.The Trades Union Congress General Council, in addition to the amendments of detail named above, proposed increases of 2s. a week in the rates of benefit to adult men and women generally and an increase of 3s. a week in the benefit for dependent children. Increases of this scale are altogether beyond the means at our disposal.On the other hand, a strong case was made to us by the National Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations for reduction of con-tributions, as having first claim on any surplus. As they pointed out, the contributions now in force were first established as.part of the economy measures of 1931, when, in order to make insurance solvent, 3d. a week was added to the contribution of each insured person of ages 18 to 64, 2d. to that of his employer and 2^-d. to that of &apos;the State, with smaller increases for juveniles. The cuts in rates of benefit made at the same time have been restored, but the higher contributions remain. Against this it may be urged that the Act of 1934 must be accepted as fresh settlement of contributions; in passing that measure, Parliament, so far from treating reduction of employers&apos; contributions as a first charge on the available funds, actually enlarged the period of benefit. It remains true nevertheless that the employers&apos; and workers&apos; con-tributions for unemployment and other forms of social insurance are a direct tax on employment, and a burden on industry whose weight cannot but cause misgiving. Unfortunately, as the em-ployers&apos; representatives pointed out, the total burden will be increased on 1st January next by requirement of an additional Id. a week from employer and workman as a contribution to pensions in the case of men and Jd. in the case of women. In view of this they urged the importance of making, as from that date, a compensatory reduction of the contribution for unemployment.Into a third group fall the representations made by a number of associations concerned with the interests of women. These associa-tions argued that the insurance scheme, as it stands, is unfair to women in several respects. First, the contribution paid by adult women is nine-tenths of the contribution paid by adult men, but the weekly rate, of benefit is only 15s. against 17s., a smaller proportion. Second, the average rate of unemployment among women is less than among men, but women . are not given the advantage of this lower liability to unemployment; on the other hand, in health insurance, their greater liability to sickness is taken into account in fixing their contributions and benefits. Third, men in addition to their higher rate of benefit draw a &quot;larger share of the benefit for dependants; the average weekly cost of a man&apos;s claim is higher than that of a woman&apos;s claim.     Fourth,
a further discrimination is imposed by the Anomalies Order depriv-ing large numbers of women on marriage of any chance of bene-fiting by their contributions. The associations making these representations suggested, as a first step towards greater equality of treatment between the sexes, the raising of the weekly rate of benefit to women ; they submitted reasons for holding that the needs of single women were not substantially less than those of men, and were certainly not less in the proportion 15 to 17.We set out those considerations affecting the position of women as well as the case made on behalf of employers for reduction of contributions, because on a later occasion it may be necessary to examine each of them further and reach conclusions about them. The facts stated in each case appear to be formally undeniable. On this occasion, we are not in a position financially to consider their proposals, and therefore we do not express an opinion on the merits or bearing of the arguments advanced.The annual surplus on which with our present knowledge, we are entitled to count, of something less than.  1,500,000 a year, is not enough to allow any general lowering of contributions. The smallest unit by which a weekly contribution can be lowered is Jd. ; that, unless we are prepared to differentiate between employers and workpeople, means -^-d. from each of the three parties, amount-ing to a loss of income of about  3,150,000 a year on persons aged 18 to 64.The annual surplus, again, is not large enough to do anything to-wards improving the relative position of women whether by raising their benefits or lowering their contributions as well as to make that particular improvement of benefits in another direction which, in our view and by common consent of nearly all who appeared before us, takes priority over all other possible uses of a surplus. This is the increase of the allowance for dependent children, from 2s. to 3s. a week. The estimated cost of this change at present rates of unemployment is about  1,250,000 a year. Allowing for the contingent liability for increased expenditure in respect of seasonal workers, this exhausts substantially our avail-able surplus. An increase of the allowance for children will strengthen, at a moderate cost, one of the weakest points in the scheme of insurance. The greater weight given to family respon-sibilities will make the unemployment benefit more nearly adequate to need, in cases in which there may now be occasion to apply for supplementation.This proposal, however, has one disconcerting effect to which our attention was called by some of those who supported the in-crease of children&apos;s allowances which we now propose. If 3s. were allowed for every dependent child, without restriction of any kind, an unemployed man with a wife and five dependent children would draw 41s. a week in unemployment benefit; a man with eight or ten dependent children (and such cases are
far from being unknown) would draw 50s. or 56s. a week. The wages of many unskilled labourers for. a full week are now in the neighbourhood of 40s., that is to say. very much less than these possible rates of unemployment benefit.. , .The possibility that benefit may exceed wages, is, of course, present in the scheme to-day. Even with the existing allowance of 2s. for each dependent child, the weekly benefit may run. up to 42s., 46s. or beyond. But cases of benefit exceeding wages now are rare. liaising the children&apos;s allowance to 3si a week may make them fairly common, if no; further restriction is imposed.In principle, a restriction seems necessary. Unemployment benefit is the direct alternative to wages : insurance against unemployment is insurance against loss of wages. It is contrary to the funda-mentnl principle of insurance and. the practice of every other form of insurance that the indemnity should be allowed to exceed the loss.The most logical course, perhaps, would be to provide that the total weekly benefit should not exceed the wages which were previously earned by the claimant or which he might expect to re-ceive in future. But, particularly since insurance contributions take no account of wages, it is also justifiable to prescribe a uniform upper limit of benefit for all cases, and this has overwhelming practical advantages. In framing our scheme for unemployment insurance in agriculture, we proposed a limit of 30s. a week as the maximum that could be drawn. In recommending now that the rate of children&apos;s allowances shall be raised from 2s. to 3s. a week, we propose a limit for benefit under the general scheme, for which we suggest, as the most appropriate figure at the present time a rate of 41s. a week, representing the benefit that would be paid to a man, wife and five children at 3s. each.It may happen that, under such a limit, some men will draw less in benefit that they would be given as assistance under Part II of the Unemployment Act, 1934. This is not likely to happen often; assistance is reduced on account of other means while benefit is not. But if it does happen, we should regard supplementation of benefit in these rare cases, as a lesser evil than&apos; that a man should be enabled to increase his income by losing employment Or be forced to decrease it by an offer, of employment.It will happen also that under our proposals men with very large families will for a time, that is to say while they have eight or more children dependent on them, receive less benefit than they would have received under the existing law. But this consequence should not be allowed to justify perpetuating an. indefensible situation. If such men prove need and no. other means during unemployment, they can and should be dealt with by way of supplementation of benefit. Even these men, over a much greater portion of their family life, during which the number of their dependent children is smaller, will be better off under our proposals than they are to-day.
The reduction of total expenditure that would result from the imposition of this limit is small, and the limit itself should not be regarded as affecting directly the financial condition of the fund. Bat it is consequential; on our proposed change in the rate of children&apos;s allowance.Finding, Recommendations and Estimate.We conclude our Report accordingly:(1) By reporting formally under section 59 (2) that the Un-employment Fund is and is likely to continue to be more than reasonably sufficient to discharge its liabilities.(2) By recommending, as a change required to make the fund no more than reasonably sufficient; that the in-creased benefit in respect of dependent children provided under section. 37 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1935, should be 3s. in place of 2s. a week, subject to the proviso that the total benefit to any claimant, should not exceed a certain limit for which we suggest 41s. a week.(3) By estimating that this recommendation will increase the expenditure of the Fund by approximately  1,250,000 a year.The balancing point of the fund is changed thereby from 18-1 per cent, to 17-7 per cent, of unemployment, and the standard reserve is changed from  16,500,000 to  18,500,000. If the higher rate of children&apos;s allowance is introduced at about the beginning of August, 1935, the additional expenditure of the fund during the remaining five months of the calendar year will be about  500,000. On this assumption, the accumulated balance of the Unemployment Fund at the end of 1935, according to revised estimate A, will be about  16,900,000, and according to revised estimate B will be about  18,750,000.Before the end of the year, however, we hope to have the results of the investigation, that is being made at our request, of the re-moter prospects of unemployment. In the light of that inves-investigation, and of the further experience of unemployment that will then have been gained, we shall be able to review the situation. If then, or at any later time, circumstances seem to require a fresh report on the financial condition of the Unemployment Fund and fresh proposals for keeping it in equilibrium, we shall prepare a report and submit our proposals.We need hardly emphasise the uncertainty on which all our present conclusions rest. In attempting to establish unemployment insurance as insurance, providing guaranteed benefits for definite premiums without risk either of insolvency or of piling up idle reserves, we are venturing into unexplored fields ambushed by dangers. At any moment our calculations may be defeated by an unexpected turn of events; our modest hopes of seeing the benefits of the scheme improve, or its burdens diminish, may be shattered
by obscure economic forces or incalculable human decisions; more happily, by a return of international co-operation in trade and finance, our present hopes may be made to,look like fears. But for all its uncertainties we believe that our attempt,is worth making; by the right union of daring and caution it may be preserved from failure.W. H. Beveridgb (Chairman). A. L.
