(THIS DOCUMENT is the PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNICMajesty&apos;s government).copy no. ,secret.CP. 204 (35).CABINET. INDIA.Appreciation of the Political Situation, &quot;by the Government of India,  dated 14th November,  1935.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential Appreciation of the Political &apos; Situation in India, dated the 14th November, 1935,  issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.1.    Reports from all Provinces for the month of October contain little of general interest or importance. The situation in Lahore continues to be very disquieting and the position is still as described in the appreciations for the last two months.    The local authorities have frequently had to deal with menacing processions and demonstrations, and as the Local Governments observe,  it is greatly to their credit that a very serious conflict has been avoided.    In other parts of India, meetings,  in particular of Muslims, have&quot; been held and there is no doubt that Muslim feelings were greatly stirred by the events which took place in Lahore.But there is no reason to modify the views expressed last month that Muslims outside the Punjab do not wish to be implicated in any serious anti-Government or communal agitation.2. At the meeting of the all-India Congress Committee at Madras,  the question of acceptance of Office under the new constitution was once again shelved, a decision which the extremist section of the Press professed to approve while moderate papers criticised it as an expression of the &quot;evasive mentality of Congress&quot;.3. Reports received from all the Provinces regarding the work of the all-India Village Industries Associations (vide the Appreciation for November,  1934) goes to show
18.62.that little or no progress has been made and very little practical work of any value has been done to improve the economic condition of the villagers.Though there are inherent difficulties in a scheme of this kind, yet if the movement had been a bona fide attempt to help villagers,  it might have been anticipated that some progress would have been recorded, and that,  in some cases at least, work would have been taken up enthusiastically.    A striking contrast to the work of this Association is afforded by the work vhich is being done by local governments and their officers out of grants placed at their disposal by the Government of India.    The schemes undertaken vary from province to province,  and are designed to meet local needs and local conditions by such measures as improvements of water supply, village roads, sanitation and drainage, public health and medical relief schemes,  improved methods of agriculture,  distribution of films and loud speakers.
