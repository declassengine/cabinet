THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.......Printed for the Cabinet., \ December 1935.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.CP. 234 (35).CABINET.DISPUTE BETWEEN ITALY AND ABYSSINIA.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues the accompanying record of a conversation between the French Ambassador and the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.A. E.Record by Sir R. Vansittart of a Conversation with the French Ambassador., THE French Ambassador came to see me this morning to tell me how pleased he had been with the Secretary of State&apos;s speech in House of Commons yesterday afternoon, and to add that he thought it would make a good preface to the impending conversations with M. Laval.He expressed his great anxiety that a settlement should be found. I said that I sincerely shared this desire, but that I thought a solution would have been more probably come by if his Government had shown more firmness than they had with the Italian Government over many months past and particularly now. Even now, I said, the instructions to the French Ambassador in Rome to tell Signor Mussolini in person that in case of an attack upon a Member of the League France would come militarily to the assistance of that Member, had not been sent. I: cited this as one among many examples of hesitation. I went on to say that if the French Government would now show greater powers of decision, the opportunity for reaching a settlement might, indeed, occur, but it must be well understood that that settlement could only be found within strictly practical limits. Otherwise, the League would be destroyed or so stultified that its practical existence would be terminated. I could not conceive that any active Member of the League could contemplate the responsibility for such a result. The terms that were now under consideration for Italy, I said, though no finality had yet been reached and all reasonable elasticity was still possible, were, indeed, very wide and generous considering that the Power to whom they would be offered had been declared an aggressor by some fifty nations. A settlement even of the nature contemplated was only possible because Abyssinia was, in fact, a special case. But there were many Members of the League who were watching eagerly for the nature of the settlement, and, while making all allowance for the speciality of the case, would lose all confidence in the future of the League if the settlement went too far. Some Members of the League, indeed, were apprehensive as to their own future. They were going to ask themselves if the League in general and France in particular could really be trusted to stand up to Germany, for example, in future, if France was afraid to stand up to Italy to-day. If the terms, in the opinion of these other Members of the League, went too far, there was only one possible answer to that question, and I thought it was one that France might well have cause to regret in the future. These apprehensive and attentive Powers were already asking themselves what, if these things could be done in the green tree of Abyssinia, would occur in the dry rot of Europe ? The problem therefore before us was one of finding reasonable and even generous terms to Italy, bearing in mind again that this was only possible owing to the 8229.   [12443]
special nature of. the&apos; case, and thai? Italy-was,&apos; hi fact, ah aggressor. There must therefore be an obvious limit to appetite on the one side and connivance on. the other. Were these considerations not borne in mind, the whole post-war structure of Europe would not only be imperilled but destroyed. That was the point which we had really now reached and which we must make a united effort to solve; but firmness and loyalty would be necessary. *..........    &quot;I proceeded that I was going to Paris this afternoon to take part in. the conversations with M. Laval which the Secretary of State was about to initiate. As, however, I should be in Paris, I was going to take the opportunity of endeavouring to form some judgment of my own of the state of Anglo-French relations. The Ambassador begged me not to form it upon Paris or even upon certain sections of Paris. I said, of course, my stay would be too short to form any complete impression and that the gathering of an impression was not the primary cause of my visit. I should be glad, however, of the fortuitous opportunity of forming even some modest views of my own. I would not conceal from his Excellency that I was genuinely apprehensive as to the future of Anglo-French relations if the present crisis continued and if the attitude of at least a very considerable part of his country continued to be as reprehensible as it had been in the past. The knowledge of that attitude was spreading very rapidly in this country, and incalculable harm would be done if it were not soon remedied. It was of no use to mince matters. There was a growing lack of confidence here, which was all the more serious in that the problems which lay ahead of us in Europe were far more serious than the already troublesome and dangerous one which we were now handling. By what I had said the Ambassador might judge of the sincerity of the desire, so far as I was concerned, and I might add so far as everybody here was concerned, of finding a reasonable settlement. But I repeated that such a settlement could only be found by means of full Anglo-French co-operation, and nothing that I had seen during these last months in any sense came up to that description. I hoped, therefore, that I might return from Paris with a better impression than the one I was taking there, and he knew that I was speaking as a loyal collaborator with his country in the past.The Ambassador replied that he earnestly hoped no one here would form their opinion of France from any temporary or partial manifestation of irritation. It was perfectly true, and he and I were both well aware of it, that one country was never really beloved in another, and that, particularly in regard to Anglo-French collaboration, this was and must always be the work of the fewer and wiser heads who saw the eventual and ineradicable identity of interests. This fundamental identity did not change, and in any real crisis the vast majority of the French nation would immediately recognise and act upon it! Indeed, those who were really of this persuasion in France were already far more numerous than any vocal elements in the other direction. -hu;I replied that I fully recognised this, but there were moments when it should be more clearly demonstrated than had been the case of late. -- ;ii. V. &apos;December 6, 1935.
