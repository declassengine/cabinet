Note, &quot;by the Secretary.I am directed &quot;by the Prime Minister to circulate to the Cabinet the attached Report of a Sub-Committee of the Supply Board, dealing with the question of priority in supply of main items of Service requirements.2.      This Report was considered by the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements at a meeting on Friday, 6th December,  1935, when the following-draft conclusions we re re ache d:-(a) To take note of a Report by a Sub-Committee of the Supply Board on priority in supply zo be given to the main items of service requirements in the event of a possible aggression by Italy.(Paper No. D.P.S. 56).(b) To approve that priority as between theDefence Departments should continue to be given to the production of anti-aircraft aimnunition and anti-tank ammunition and equipment.(c) In order to obtain increased output from existing contractors and to enlist the resources of new firms as a further basis of supply,  to a\ithorioe the Defence Departments to take general action to bring into effect at the earliest possible date the policy of the shadow armament industry referred to in paragraph 9 of the Report (Paper No. D. P.

MOST ^SECRET.,; P.S. 0. (S.B, )  558,COMMITTEE 0? IMPERIAL DEFENCE,PRINCIPAL SUPPLY OFFICERS COMMITTEE.SUPPLY BOARD n&quot;PRIORITY IN SUPPLY TO BE GIVEN TO THE MAIN ITEMS OF SERVICE REQUIREMENTS  IN THE EVENT OF A POSSIBLE AGGRESSION BY ITALY.REPORT by a Sub-committee of the Supply Board.At their 14th meeting held on the 26th November9 19359 the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements re-corded inter.....alia the following conclusion&quot;(l)(g) That the Supply Board should advise as tothe priority in supply to be given to the main items of Service requirements in the event of a possible aggression by Italy9 and report at the earliest possible moment.V2.        we understand that the above conclusion is the outcome of a discussion on the acceleration of industrial production,, which arose at the 14-th meeting of the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements after the shortages in anti-aircraft ammunition had been considered-.      We would point out that this subject was previously considered by the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements at their 8th meeting held on the 17th September9 19359 when certain measures to accelerate the production of war stores were approved (see Appendix) ? including not only measures to widen the basis of supply for anti-aircraft ammunition but to cover the acceleration of production of other forms of war stores.      In addition the Sub-Committee approved., in principle9 the necessity for a policy of continuity of orders. -
3.        The requirements put forward in September were based on certain assumptions, which briefly were:-(a) That the war would take the form of a predominantlyNaval and Air war and that the Army requirements would be relatively small-(b) That generally speaking priority of requirements should be given to the admiralty.(c) That as the air action would be complementary to naval action, the Air Ministry requirements should be co-ordinated with those of the Admiralty.(d) That the war Office should be prepared to releaseproductive capacity, where possible, in order to ensure that the priority of requirements of other Defence Departments could be met.4.        As regards present instructions that the Supply Board should investigate the position with particular reference to the emergency at -present existing vis-a-vis. Italy, we have assumed that in such a war the co-operation of Prance, is not assured and that the predominant partners would be the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force in the Mediterranean and the Middle Bastj    Army commitments being confined to the defence of Malta, Egypt and the Middle Bast ports.5.        Dealing with the question of priorities, we consider that although our commitments are now greater than they were in September, owing to the despatch of additional forces overseas, the principle still remains the same, and anti-aircraft ammunition and equipment should be placed first in priority of all of the three Defence Departments. The priority as between Departments for anti-aircraft ammunition should remain as arranged between Defence Departments in September.      To this urgent priority must now be added that of anti-tank equipment and ammunition for Egypt.There are many other articles of armament supply in which bottlenecks exist and which are under investigation by the Defence Departments.      The only way in which priority for these articles can be worked out is for the departments
to formulate their demands and for priority to &quot;be settled by interdepartmental discussion.      If competing claims arise, which cannot be settled interdepartmentally or by the Supply Soixdj they will have to be referred to higher authority.6.        Orders, to capacity, have been placed with all firms now capable of undertaking the work of anti-aircraft ammunition supply.     Action to open up new avenues of production v/as initiated in pursuance of conclusions (b)  and (g)  of the 8th meeting of the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements, held on 17th September, 1935.     This implies the selection of suitable firms, the preparation of an appropriate form of contract, and the inducement of firms to tender under that contract for the production of stores&apos; with which they are unfamiliar.      Action on these lines has pro-ceeded steadily, but output under such conditions cannot be expected to materialise for many months.7.        Ve have considered whether any improvement in output of anti-aircraft ammunition could be made, on the basis of a con-tinuance of peace-time arrangements, by such measures as further increasing the hours of work in the shops on which we must at present rely.      In regard to some parts of the processes re-quired for the production of ammunition, some acceleration might be obtained in this way, provided the matter could he agreed with the Trade Unions.      But we do not consider .that any material acceleration of the whole supply of completed ammunition would be likely to result.8.        We have considered how far improvements could he made in output of all types of war stores by adopting   a war-time system of production involving the conditions of the Defence of the Realm net.      This raises political issues beyond our competence..     We are, however, of opinion that no material improvement dan ensue from such measures, immediately or in the early future.
9.        It appears to us that the only method &quot;by which the sources of supply of war stores can &quot;be expanded beyond existing resources is by the adoption and bringing into effect at the earliest possible date of the policy of the shadow armaments industry.      The conditions necessary to achieve this are -(a) An approved long-term programme- guaranteeingfunds to the Departments.(b) Continuity of orders to the trade, so that con-tractors raai&apos; be attracted by business pro-positions and so that personnel, and especially supervising staffs, may be trained.(c) Subsidies, whether taken up in the cost of theproduced article or in direct payment.(d) Greater&apos; recourse to non-competitive contracts. Continuity of orders should be guaranteed for aperiod of three to four years.      Firms will then make the necessary arrangements to expand their shops and instal new machinery purchased either at home or from abroad.The above policy has been agreed to by the Treasury in the case of certain new firms for the production of anti-aircraft ammunition, referred to in paragraph 6 above, but for no other warlike stores up to date.      (The authority for long-term contracts could also be applied with even greater advantage to existing firms).1P* Summary of Conclusions..(l)  That whilst priority should continue to be given to the production of anti-aircraft ammunition and anti-tank ammunition and equipment, priorities for remaining armament stores must be worked out in the first in-slanee between departments as far as possible, competing claims which cannot be settled interdepartmentally or by the Supply Board being referred to higher authority.
(2) That there is no prospect in the immediatefuture of further accelerating the production of anti-aircraft ammunition from the present available sources of supply.(3)  That in order to obtain increased output from existing contractors and to enlist the re-sources of new firms as a further basis of supply 3 general action on the principles given in paragraph 9 above should be approved and should proceed.(4) That s even when these measures have been taken., an inevitable time lag of six to nine months will ensue before material additional output from new sources of supply can be realised.(Signed)    W.

SUE-COMMITTEE ON DEFENCE POLICY AND REQUIREMENTS.ANTI-AIRCRAFT AMMUNITION.Note by the Secretary.The attached Report, prepared by Supply Committee No.  I in accordance with conclusion (ii) of the Minutes of the 7th meeting of the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Recpairements, has been submitted to the Principal Supply Officers Committee, by whom it is being considered at 11.30 a. m. ,  on Tuesday,  17 th September,  1935. &apos;As there Will not be time to submit a Report by the Principal Supply Officers Committee before tomorrow&apos;s meeting, the Report by Supply Committee No.  I is circulated in order to acquaint the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements in advance with the latest information on this subject.( S signed) M. P. A. PIANKEY;
REPORT BY JUPPLY COMMITTEE NO. I OR Ah TI -A TR CR Ab&apos;T&quot; A&apos; fl/tUE IT I OR.The Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements, at its meeting on the 11th September., decided in regard to anti-aircraft ammunition&quot;That the Principal Supply Officers Committee and its appropriate Sub--Commit tees should, without delay, take up the above  question as a matter of great urgency, to be dealt with in advance of  their wider investi-gations, and advise how the limiting factors   can most readily be removed by the Admiralty and the War Office.      In order to ensure the closest collaboration at  all stages,  the Treasury should be represented on any committee dealing with this (if this is not already the ca se) &apos;.REPORT.1. In view of the extreme urgency of the above questionit was referred to a Sab-Committee of Supply Committee ho.   I,  consisting of Mr.  G. S.  whit ham (Chairman, Supply Committee No.   I), Captain H.J.B.  Hall, &apos; C.B.E. , R.N. , (Chief Superintendent of Armament Supply, Admiralty).2. The members of the bub-Committee were present atthe discussions between the Admiralty and the War Office in connection with the executive action necessary to increase the output of anti-aircraft ammunition.3. Having regard to the existing system of placing orders year by year with the Royal Ordnance Rectories and the armament firms, the bub-Committee are satisfied that the existing manufacturing facilities therein are being-utilised to the best advantage.
anti-aircraft ammunition is realised and the Sub-Committee are of opinion that unless immediate  steps are taken to extend the existing sources of supply, there is no hope -whatever that any large supplies of ammunition components will become available within a reasonable period of time.5. It is clearj therefore,   that further steps mustbe taken without delay to widen the basis of supply. The steps which are recommended and which have already in the main been recommended by Supply Committee No.  I are -(a) that certain existing Government factories should be expanded;(b) that the capacity of Government and other explosive factories for the manufacture of explosives should be increased;(c) that existing pivotal centres and armament firms should be provided with additional plant in order to increase their productive capacity;(d) that selected non-armament firms should be supplied with the presses, machine tools and equipment required to balance their existing plant,      Phi s, in effect, would result in the opening-up of a completely new field of production.6. It is emphasised that even if the steps recommendedabove are approved and implemented,  some months will elapse before any appreciable additional output will be obtained.      Tnis applies particularly to (d)  above.
7, The Sub-Committee are ox  opinion that the mostimportant limiting factors in obtaining adequate supplies of gun ammunition components lie in the fact that there has been no continuity of orders in past years.    Con-sequently, both as regards the increase of productive capacity of existing firms and the exploitation of new sources ox capacity,      it is emphasised that the continuity of orders is of cardinal importance.In this connection it is recognised that some provision would have to be made for the possibility of payment of compensation by the abate in the event of such contract being broken.8. In conclusion the bub-Committee wish to emphasise that without a considerable increase in the number of firms employed on the manufacture of gun ammunition components on the lines recommended above, it will be impossible to meet any serious increase in the demands for anti-aircraft ammunition.      It is further emphasised that the provision of anti-aircraft ammunition is a relatively small item in the problem of ammunition production in emergency.(3igned)    G.3.
