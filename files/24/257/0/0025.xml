TffTS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.It will be recalled that last session the Board of Trade introduced into Parliament the Cotton Spinning Industry Bill and the Weights and Measures Bill dealing with sand and ballast, and bottles.      The latter measure had passed through the House of Lords and had reached the House of Commons, whilst the former Bill had been introduced in the Commons and was awaiting Second Reading.      It was intended that Parliament should be asked to pass these measures into law after the Recess, but the Dissolution intervened.In these circumstances I ask for formal authority to reintroduce the two Bills as early as possible in the coming Session.      I assume that there is no need to refer these bills again to the Home Affairs Committee.SECRET.(T.P. 205(35).COPY NO.C A BINE T.Cotton Spinning Industry Bill and the Weights and Measures Bill.Note by the President of the Board of Trade.W.R.Board of Trade,21st November, 1935.
