CP.  2jO  (35).Copy NoCABINET.ROYAL COMMISSION ON TITHE RENTCHARG-E.Memorandum &quot;by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and &quot;the Minister of Agr1culture and Fisheries.The Royal Commission are about to present their Report.    TheMajority Report is to be signed by the Chairman (Sir John Fischer Williams), Sir Edward Peacock (subject to a Reservation) and Sir John Lloyd.    The Report states that Lord Cornwallis, who died on the 26th September, 1935, expressed complete concurrence with the Majority Report at the meeting of the Commission held before his death,    The remaining member of the Commission, Sir Leonard Coates, is to present a Minority Report,2. It is understood that both Reports contain proposals of acomplicated and far reaching character,  involving consequences of importance both financially and politically to the State,  the Local Authorities and the Church (as the principal tithe-owner) as well as to the tithe-payers03. The Cabinet will naturally wish to study the subject withgreat care from diverse points of view before deciding what policy they should themselves adopt.    V/ith this object we recommend that a Cabinet Committee should be appointed forthwith to examine and advise on the Reports,h&apos;        It is understood that both Reports propose to reduce substantially both the amount and the duration of the tithe-payer&apos;s annual liability, with a view to extinguishing the whole liability in the course of a short life-time,    We would remind our colleagues that there has been considerable agitation for suspending proceed-ings for the recovery and for the redemption of tithe rentcharge-1-
while the.Royal Commission has been sitting, and this agitationwill be greatly strengthened when the Report is made publicunless it is accompanied by some statement of Government policyIndeed, if the Report should appear without such a statement,the.position would almost certainly have been prejudiced inthe tithe-payer&apos;s favour if- the Government should subsequentlydecide not to adopt the Majority .Report as it stands,&apos;5* It is  therefore very desirable that the Reports shouldnot be made public until the Government is in a position to announce its own policy, and that the announcement should befollowed by legislation at the earliest possible dated    Itwould be possible to defer publication for a few weeks in orderto enable this to be done;    but it must be expected that asscon as Parliament meets the Government will be pressed to makea statement.    The matter is therefore urgent.6. We recommend therefore -(1)    that a Cabinet Committee be appointed to advise on the Commission&apos;s Report, with an instruction to report to the Cabinet in time for a decision to be taken as to the Government&apos;s policy before Parliament rises; and(2)    that, in the meanwhile, publication of the Commission&apos;s Report should be postponed, any enquiry made by Parliamentary Question or otherwise regarding the Report to be dealt with by a.statement to the effect that the Report has been received and that the Government are considering its -proposals&apos; with a view of announcing its policy in -regard thereto at an early date when the Report itself, will be published.(initialled )   IT.

APPENDIX.1c It is understood that the Majority Report recommends that tithe rentcharge in its present form he abolished at an early date, and that in lieu thereof tithe-payers of all classes he allowed to extinguish their existing liabilities by hO annual payments of  91.11s,2da^,  comparing with a present liability of either  105 in perpetuity, or  109,10s.Od-  including sinking fund for a period ending some 75 years hence. 2*        These annuities will be collected by the State (through the Board of In land Revenue) which in turn will become responsible for the payment of interest and sinking fund on approximately  70 millions of a new class of guaranteed.3 per cent,  stock to be issued to the present tithe-owners in proportion to their present rights to tithe rentcharge, which they will be required to surrender,    Tims, the tithe-owner will no longer have any connection, direct or indirect, with the tithe-payer, and will become the holder of a certain amount of guaranteed stock, which he will be free to sell or dispose-of as he thinks fit, and which will be as readily marketable as any other Government security,,3. The amount of this stock to be issued to each tithe-owner will be the principal amount required to produce, at 3 per centc interest, an income equal to the net annual value of an assumed tithe rentcharge of  91,11s,2d.  gross (i.e.  a rate equal to the proposed new annuity).    The net annual value is arrived at after deductions&apos; for cost of collection, land tax, rates paid by the tithe-owner on the average of the last three years adjusted on the basis of the reduced gross annual value, and for improvement of security, by reason of the substitution ofSir Edward Peacock in his Reservation proposes 50 payments.The figures relating to annual value of tithe rentcharge refer throughout to tithe rentcharge of the par value of  100, and as regards net annual value and future income rates are taken at an average figure of 10s. in the  .-3-

It will be necessary therefore to balance the account by means of an Exchequer contribution, which the Majority Report estimates at approximately  375,000 per annum.^ To this must be added the cost of collection and of the Temporary Commission which the Commission propose should be appointed to define the liability of each individual tithe-paying property owner in respect of his tithable land. 6., The Commission illusti^ate the financial working ofThe Report recommends that the redemption annuities should be recoverable in the same way and with the same remedies as income tax under Schedule A.P If the redemption annuities are payable for 50 years, as proposed by Sir Edward Peacock,  This figure will become  70,000 o
the scheme as follows:-Expenditure.Iterest on  69,908,427 stock at 3 per cent.Eking fund to redeem Tabove stock in 40 years (at 3 per cent, (payments and interest Ion half-yearly basis)2,097,253Income.Payments from landowners - Gross 2,838,426Less Remissions&quot;say _200,000 2,638,426915,565     Payments from Treasury 3,012,818374,392  3,012,818+7* As a set-off to the Exchequer contribution of  375,000per annum for 40 years, and the cost of collection etc.   the Treasury will he relieved of the contribution which it now makes from the Consolidated Fund to the rates on ecclesiastical tithe rentcharge, a liability which has averaged approximately  540,000 in the last three years.    There will, however, he the contingent liability for the interest and sinking fund ( 3 millions per annum for 40 years) upon the Guaranteed Stock. 8. There is a further liability to which the Commissionrefer hut in respect of which they have made no financial provision in their scheme.    The extinguishment of tithe rentcharge will result in its disappearance as a rateable hereditament, and inasmuch as agricultural land on which approximately 90 per cent,  of the tithe rentcharge is at present charged has been derated by the Local Government Act,1929, it follows that the rates previously charged on such tithe rentcharge will constitute a loss to the local authority. Although this might not press heavily in the majority of urban districts, it might represent In rural districts an increased rate poundage approaching 2s.Od., and it may be difficult, if not impossible, for the Government to resist a claim from local authorities for compensation from the Exchequer.    It iss The Commission propose that In any case in which the annuity in any year exceeds one-third of the Schedule B. value of an agricultural holding the excess amount should not be payable or recoverable.+ If the redemption annuities are payable for 50 years,  asproposed by Sir Edward Peacock,  this figure will become  70,000.
estimated that the local rates on tithe rentcharge amount at present to approximately  1 million per annum,  and after making allowance for all relevant circumstances it would seem only prudent to assume.,  in reviewing the financial effects of the Commission^ proposals as a whole,  that the Exchequer will he obliged to provide compensation for the Local Authorities up to a total sum ranging from  6509000 to  750s000 per annum and continuing for at least 40 years.9, The net additional charge upon the Exchequer consequent upon the proposals in the Majority Report may thus be put at between  600,000 and  700,000 per annum55 for say 40 years, together with the contingent liability for the interest and sinking fund upon the Guaranteed Stock.10o The Local Authorities?  even if partial compensation isprovided by the State,, as suggested above,, will suffer an immediate loss of between  250,000 and  350,000 per annum,  which they will presumably be obliged to make good by an increased levy upon the rate-payers,11, The Minority Report by Sir Leonard Coates proposes adifferent scheme for the extinguishment of all tithe rentcharge on lines less favourable to the tithe-owners than the Majority Report,  while reducing the liability of the tithe-paying landowner to a point approximating to  that proposed in the Majority Report  (40 redemption annuities of  90 each). As a result, he provides in his scheme for a guarantee fund out of  the receipts from the redemption annuities to meet a claim by local authorities for compensation for loss of rates consequent on the extinguishment of tithe rentcharge. Sir Leonard proposes to reduce the stabilised value of tithe rentcharge from  105 by two stages - on the 1st April 1936, to  90 and on a day to be appointed but not later than 1sth   Under Sir Edward peacock&apos;s Reservation these figures will become  300,000 and  400,000 per annum respectively for 50 years.&apos;     : I; -6-
April.   1939 to  80 as against  91. 11.2d.  proposed in the Majority Report,,12. The effect of Sir Leonard&apos;s proposals on the laytithe-owner, who will be compensated by the issue of a 3 per cent.  Government Stock, would be to provide  a -future income of  44.14-,0d.   subject to further deduction in cases where the gross annual value of the tithe rentcharge, if calculated at the rate of  80 would have exceeded one-third of the Schedule 3.  value for the five years ending 5th April,  1936. 13. As regards what he calls &quot;the Church of England titherentcharge&quot;,  viz,   tithe rentcharge vested in Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty in trust for benefices and ecclesiastical corporations and tithe rentcharge owned by the Ecclesiastical Commission-ers, Sir Leonard does not propose to make  any capital pay-ment for extinguishment., but proposes to deal with the re-redemption annuities in a separate fund administered by a Tithe Redemption Commission.      Under his scheme the future income allocated out of the redemption annuities in regard to tithe rentcharge at present attached to a. benefice would be  70 and to that owned by an ecclesiastical corporation  59,  subject to reduction on    account of remissions where the redemption annuity exceeds one-third of the Schedule B, value of agricultural land.      The remainder of the net income from the above-mentioned redemption annuities after deducting contributions to a guarantee fund to compensate local authorities for loss of rates will be carried to a sinking fund,  the ultimate destination of which is left open presumably for the subsequent decision of Parliament. 14. Sir Leonard recommends that the Church Assembly shouldbe given three years to formulate a scheme of &quot;re-arrangement of incomes of benefices within the Church itself&quot;, e.g. union of benefices,   and by a re-marshalling of its own resources
in order to provide for the. needs of the poorer beneficed clergy for the  assistance of whom Sir Leonard recommends a grant by Parliament of  100,000 in each of these three years. 15. His scheme so far as Church of England tithe rent-charge is concerned provides (after deducting the contribution to the guarantee fund for local taxation) for the whole of the net income receivable during the next 40 years from the redemption annuities in respect of tithe rentcharge at present owned by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners to be  added to the sinking fund referred to in paragraph 9,  in order to assist in the provision after the 40 years of an income approximating to the net income receivable from the redemption annuities in respect of Church of England tithe rentcharge on the basis of a gross  annual value of  80.16. As regards tithe rentcharge vested in the WelshCommissioners, Sir Leonard proposes that it should he extinguished substantially on the same lines as that to be adopted in the case of Church of England tithe rentcharge, namely,  on the basis of a gross annual value of  80.      He comments, however, on the financial relations between the Welsh Commissioners and the National JJebt Commissioners,   and points out that the reduction of the gross annual value of tithe rentcharge from  105 to  80 will result in the Welsh Commissioners being unable to meet their present obligations under the Welsh Church Acts in regard to the loan from the National Debt Commissioners guaranteed by the Treasury and repayable by an annuity terminating in 1954 calculated at the rate of 5-g- per cent.      Sir Leonard&apos;s scheme meets the situation by extending the period of repayment of this loan to 40 years from the commencement, of his scheme.      He proposes that the redemption annuities should be paid into a Welsh fund operated
by the Tithe Redemption Commissioners,  and suggests that the Welsh Commissioners should be dissolved, their properties, obligations and duties   being transferred to the Tithe Redemption Commissioners.
