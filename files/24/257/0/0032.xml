THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1935.CONFIDENTIAL.Copy No.CP. 212 (35).CABINET.DISPUTE BETWEI.EEN ITALY AND ABYSSINIA.Embargo on Oil Supplies for Italy.WE circulate to our colleagues a memorandum drawn up in the Foreign Office on the question of the imposition of an embargo on oil supplies for Italy.The Chairman of the Committee of Eighteen has stated that he will announce, on or about the 29th November, the date on which the Committee shall meet to consider this particular question. It is expected that he will fix a day in the following week.A Memorandum on this question, drawn up by the Petroleum Department of the Board of Trade, is attached hereto (Annex I).2. The present position at Geneva is that a proposal, No. TV (a) (see Annex II),. was adopted by the Committee of Eighteen on the 6th November, which advocated the extension of the embargo provided for in Proposal IV to oil, coal, iron and steel &quot; as soon as the conditions necessary to render this extension effective have been realised.&quot; It is now reported from the League Secretariat that M. Vasconcellos, Chairman of the Committee, is anxious to call an immediate meeting of the Committee of Eighteen to consider this Proposal.3. M. Vasconcellos considers that he can no longer take the responsibility of refraining from convoking the Committee of Eighteen, in view of (a) Mr. Cordell Hull&apos;s declaration of the 15th November (Annex III); and (&amp;) The German decree of the 9th November, a summary of which is attached in Annex IV.4. M. Vasconcellos points out that oil was mentioned by Mr. Cordell Hull,, who said that its export for war purposes was directly contrary to the general spirit of the recent Neutrality Act. The German decree covers most of the commodities mentioned in Proposals IV and TV (a).5. Proposal TV (a) was adopted unanimously by the Committee of Eighteen.. The somewhat obscure wording of it was due to a desire not to embarrass the United States by saying outright that, if America would co-operate, the extension of the embargo could be enforced.S. H.A. E.Foreign 0\;ffnce, November 27, 1935.EMBARGO ON OIL SUPPLIES FOR ITALY.8202   [12370]b
6. The Soviet and Roumanian Governments have replied agreeing to the extension of the embargo subject to the participation of all other producing countries. The Government of India have informed the League that they are prepared; to extend the export embargo to oil, pig-iron, steel, and coal whenever such action is recommended by the Committee of Eighteen. The Iraqi Govern-ment agree to the proposal,, and are awaiting the date proposed to bring it into force. The Netherlands Government have reserved their final decision until they have considered other replies. The texts of these replies will be found in Annex V.7. His . Majesty&apos;s Government, have as yet made no reply to this proposal; but they wilt have to declare their attitude at latest whenever the Committee of Eighteen meets.It had been originally proposed that the Committee of Eighteen should meet on the 29th November. At the urgent request of M. Laval, who expatiated on his real internal difficulties at the present time, the meeting has been deferred, but it is likely to have to be held in a week or ten days, unless M. Laval falls and France is left without a Government. His Majesty&apos;s Government acquiesced in this request, which gives them more time to survey the situation created by the accumulated indications from various sources that an embargo on oil might possibly impel Signor Mussolini into an act of aggression on this country.8. Oil is an essential need, and it is obvious that a complete embargo of petroleum supplies to Italy would cripple the Italian Government and bring the war to a speedier end. It would end very quickly if, as stated in the memorandum, there is no storage accommodation in Italy for more than three or four months&apos; normal supplies; but it is during those three or four months that our weakness is greatest.;9. A complete and immediate embargo, however, is out of the question Owing to lack of control over the American supplies.10. Italy&apos;s supplies at present come from Roumania (40-6 per cent.), TJ.S.S.R. (16 per cent.), Iran (15 per cent.), Dutch West Indies (10-7 per cent.), United States of America (7-1 per cent.), other countries (10-6 per cent,).11. An embargo by Roumania, U.S.S.R., Iran (i.e., Anglo-Iranian Oil Company) and the Netherlands would therefore seem as if it would be effective in dislocating Italy&apos;s oil supply and hampering her African war, even if it were not decisive.12. It is possible that Roumania&apos;s full co-operation would have to be purchased in some way or other, perhaps by the United Kingdom and other countries making special purchases of Roumanian oil, though the reply of the Roumanian Government contains no such stipulation. Roumanians full co-operation would be essential.13. The Memorandum points out that it is the very definite view of the British oil companies that an embargo could not be effective which did not extend to supplies from the United States of America.14. American supplies might be curtailed by commercial prudence or by Government action direct or indirect, but not by any other consideration. The Government is unlikely to intervene, and Italy will pay in cash for so, essential a need so long as she has cash to pay. The American Secretary of State has discouraged in his statements the shipment of petroleum to belligerents; but it is impossible to say to what extent the voice of Mr. Hull will prevail against the hope of profit. In any event the efficacy of the embargo, if imposed, would be subject to periodical review by a committee at Geneva.15. If export of oil to Italy were prohibited from Roumania, U.S.S.R. and Dutch and British sources, its place would be taken to some extent, but probably not completely, by American and other supplies.16. Another form of oil sanction might be the refusal of oil tank shipping for the transport of petroleum in bulk. American oil is not to any great extent transported to Europe in American tonnage; figures of the world&apos;s oil tank tonnage are given in Annex VI. The British Empire and Norway are responsible for nearly 50 per cent.; the United States share is a considerable one, but it is
mainly used for coastwise traffic. The withholding of tanker shipping from service to Italy and her colonies might prove an&apos;effective sanction, but the Italian tanker fleet is a considerable one, and in the opinion of experts would be sufficient for Italy5s needs. &apos;17. In view of the situation described above, it is suggested that the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government should be as follows : (1) His: Majesty&apos;s Government should at once take steps to obtain from M. Laval an undertaking that he will without delay make it clear to Signor Mussolini that any attack upon any member of the League . . carrying out sanctions is an attack upon the League collectively (see&apos; Article 16, paragraph 3), and that in consequence were any such action to be taken against His Majesty&apos;s Government France would also be involved. .(2) His Majesty&apos;s Government should also communicate with the French Government with a view to a beginning being made with the conversa-modifications on the lines which the French Government themselves suggested for ensuring full co-operation between the naval, military and air authorities of the two countries.(3) That similar conversations should take place with other Mediterranean Powers at the appropriate time and place.(4) That there should be no avoidable delay in taking a decision with regard to the imposition of the oil sanction. If, however, M. Laval will not undertake to make the statement in Rome as proposed in (1) then it will be necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government to explain their position at Geneva.(5) His Majesty&apos;s Government should adopt the following attitude at Geneva. They should inform the League in terms similar to those used by Russia and Roumania that they would be prepared to participate in an embargo on the products mentioned in proposal IV(a) of the Co-ordinating Committee,* provided the producing States co-operated. When the Committee meets they should, if possible, avoid taking a lead in proposing the imposition of an oil sanction, but if another country proposed it and the proposal led to practical action, His Majesty&apos;s Government would agree to participate if Roumania, the U.S.S.R. and the Netherlands also agreed.(6) His Majesty&apos;s Government would not insist upon a coal sanction being connected with an oil sanction; though they would not at present be prepared to withhold coal from Italy, unless an oil embargo were at the same time in force.(7) His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to investigate the practicability of withholding the service of tank steamers.Foreign Office, November 27, 1935.[12370]* Petroleum, pig-iron and steel, coal and coke.
;ANNEX I.Proposed Embargo on Supplies of Oil to Italy. ;Memorandum by Petroleum Department of the Board of Trade.Italian requirements.1. The quantities of petroleum and petroleum products imported for consumption in Italy in recent years have been-Period. Metric tons.1933*...............      1,738,0001934*.........       ...... 1,856,0001935 (January-June)*.........      1,012,0001935 (January-September)! ... 1,543,000* From Official Trade Returns. f From Italian Official Gazette.Actually in 1934 about 2\ million tons of oil were &apos;&apos; unloaded &apos;&apos; at Italian Ports, the difference between this figure and that given above being due to the fact that oil fuel for bunkers is not counted as an import, and apparently oil still in bond, on which duty has not been paid, is also excluded. Purchases on Government account may also not be included.Sources of Supply.2. There is only a small production of natural petroleum in Italy amounting to about 25,000 tons per annum, and small supplies may also be available from Albania. The principal sources of supply are Roumania, U.S.S.R., Iran, U.S.A. and Dutch West Indies. On the basis of the figures given in the previous paragraph as imports into Italy, the following shows the percentages of the total contributed by these five sources : 	1933		m	54.		55.

Imports in recent months.3.   The latest official figures of imports do not go beyond the end of September.   At the rate of import in the first six months of 1935 the increase would not have been greater than that shown in 1934 over 1933.   The average imports for each of the first two quarters were 496,000 tons.   In the September quarter, 531,000 tons were imported not a very marked increase.   Such data as are available indicate that shipments during October and the first half of November were heavier.   It is hoped within the next two or three days to have some fairly reliable and up to date information supplied from trade sources.Exports from the U.S.A. to Italy have been considerably higher in July, August and September of this year as compared with the corresponding period of last year. ..   The figures for all products are :    . a-::^... ^$mf, \h ;r- -a..-.     ,&apos;.I.a a&apos; . Tons.        .July-September, 1934   . ...       ....      ...        34,885&apos;., July-September, 1935      ..........     &apos; 96,245
Some of this increase may not be reflected in the Italian official accounts until October or November.Reliable estimates furnished from the trade indicate that during the months of August, September and October Italy&apos;s purchases of petroleum in the U.S.A. exceed 140,000 tons, consisting largely of crude oil and light fuel oil. This figure compares with imports from the U.S.A. shown in the Italian Trade Accounts of 62,000 tons during the first six months of this year. Some of these purchases may be for delivery over the next few months.It is also reported that exports from Roumania to Italy have been very heavy, especially since the prospect of sanctions became likely. Roumanian official figures for the period July-October 1935 (the. latest available) compared with the corresponding period in 1934 follows : Metric Tons.July-October 1934 ...       ...       ...       ...      280,000July-October 1935 ............      727,000So far as Persia is concerned, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company has furnished information which shows that all deliveries made by the Company to Italy for the period the 1st January-5th November are only up by 15,000 tons compared with this period in 1934, the totals being 190,000 and 175,000, tons respectively.The Asiatic Petroleum Company (Shell Group), which imports into Italy from various countries including Roumania, Dutch West Indies and Dutch East Indies, have furnished information which shows that for the period the 1st August to the 19th November their deliveries to Italy were 183,000 tons in 1934 and 198,000 tons in 1935, an increase of 15,000 tons in 3-^ months. The increase was stated to have taken place in August and September and for October and November the figures are stated to be approximately the same in both years.Official figures of shipments to Italy from the U.S.S.R. show considerable decreases during 1935 as compared with last year. Some doubt has been thrown on these figures by information supplied from trade sources. Italian Trade Accounts give the following figures : Tons.1933 ..................      514,0001934 ..................      404,0001935 (January-June)       ...       ......      162,000These are in line with the general fall which has taken place in exports of oil from Russia to all destinations during the period mentioned.Effect of Financial Sanctions.4. There are four or five large oil groups or organisations concerned with the import of oil into Italy, viz., the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, the Socony Vacuum, another big American group, the Asiatic Petroleum Company (Shell Group), the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and the A.G.I.P., an Italian Government-controlled Company. The Anglo-Iranian does not sell much oil in Italy itself, but in the main disposes of its imports in bulk to the Asiatic Petroleum Company. It has a relatively small depot at Trieste, which is used mainly for supplying Switzerland and Austria. All the others have considerable organisations in Italy for distribution purposes and supply of bunkers, an important branch of the Italian trade.The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the Asiatic Petroleum Company as companies &quot; ordinarily carrying on business in the United Kingdom &quot; are bound by the financial sanctions Order in Council, and have given assurances that they are not supplying Italy or Italians outside Italy except on a cash basis.The Socony-Vacuum Company are reported to have stated that they will not insist on payment in advance, but they will, in their negotiations, introduce terms to ensure regular payments on such a basis as in their judgment amply to protect their credit position.The London Director of the Standard Oil of New Jersey, in conversation recently with the Director of the Petroleum Department, gave a very similar explanation of the policy of his Company. In view of the present standard of Italian credit, he said that, from a purely commercial point of view, his Company was not likely to give much in the way of credit. In addition it is understood that, as a result of consultations between the two big British Companies affected
and the Standard, the latter has stated that they do not intend to extend their shipments beyond their normal level with the object of taking up trade which the British Companies do not feel able to accept.There was some doubt at one period whether financial sanctions were working properly in Roumania, as business was being done through the Roumanian-Italian Clearing Agreement. However, it is understood that, as from the 18th November, payments through the Clearing Agreement are no longer admitted. This was an important point in view of the existence in Roumania of a number of quite large &apos;&apos; independent &apos;&apos; companies, and the Italians have interests in the oil industry there.Even if all suppliers were to insist on cash it seems to be fairly generally accepted in the oil industry that in view of the essential need for oil Italy will be able by restricting imports of less essential commodities, and by rationing consumers in Italy, to find the money for some time for the oil she must have.Stocks position.5. It is difficult to get reliable information as to the quantity of oil which Italy has in stock. It is doubtful whether storage accommodation exists for more than three or four months&apos; normal supplies. It can probably be assumed that the Italian naval authorities have taken as much as they can, and that the A.CLP. has its storage tanks as full as possible. But it is open to doubt whether the big oil companies are holding full stocks. In fact, conversations with representatives of the Standard and Shell Companies would indicate that they are not fully stocked. Apart from the general uncertainty of the position in Italy, these companies are not very favourably disposed to the Italian authorities on account of the present Government oil policy there, which is designed to compel the erection of more refineries and the keeping of larger reserves. The latest estimate by the Shell of the stocks in Italy, and they agree that it is difficult to be certain of the facts, is that stocks do not exceed three months&apos; normal supply.Motor spirit which is vital for aeroplanes and tanks was supplied during the first eight months of this year, according to Italian official accounts, fromthe following sources :- Tongfroa- - -  -  -  ::: tS&amp;Sttssr&quot;       &quot;&apos;  \\\  ...... 43,300gi&quot;A    :::       .....   ... 15.300Dutch East Indies............ 10.500Other countries252,700In September another 43,200 tons is recorded as having been imported, but sources of supply are not stated.The Italians are reliably reported to have been making considerable purchases of motor spirit in the States, and information has been received in the last few days of several large shipments having left the USA., including Californian ports, an unusual source of supply.The Italians have also made efforts to buy spot cargoes of motor spirit in this country, again an unusual source of supply. The Asiatic Petroleum Company sold one cargo for cash two or three weeks ago at a price well above market rates, but a second cargo they were asked to quote for was declined because of price. These happenings would indicate either that Italy is not too well placed as regards supplies of motor spirit or that she is not leaving anything to chance in view of the possibility of further sanctions.Proposed imposition of an embargo on oil supplies.6. The information given in paragraph 2 shows that normally about 90 per cent, of Italy&apos;s oil supplies come from five sources, that Roumania is easily the largest supplier, followed on the basis of the first half of this year by U.S.S.R., Iran, Dutch West Indies (almost entirely the refined products of Venezuelan crude) and USA. It might at first sight appear, therefore, that if the Governments of Roumania, U.S.S.R., Iran and Holland were to agree to an
embargo, supported by this country because of our large British oil companies involved, it should be practicable to deprive Italy of about 85 per cent, of her supplies.It&apos; is, however, the very definite view of the British oil companies that an embargo could not be effective which did not extend to supplies from the U.S.A. There is a large number of very substantial oil companies in that country which are outside the control or the influence of the large groups, and even a firm under-taking by the latter not to supply oil would not prevent the &quot; independents &quot; providing all that was essential to Italy as long as Italy can pay for it, and at the moment there is no evidence of any difficulty on the part of Italy in finding cash. This view is supported by the Director of the Standard Oil Company referred to above, who was seen recently by the Petroleum Department.The British companies would not regard an undertaking by the U.S. Government to endeavour to limit their companies to, say, the 1934 level of supplies as worth anything, for they are of opinion that the U.S. Government could not implement its undertaking.Apart from the need of having the U.S.A. in, in order to make the embargo effective, British companies feel that there is a real danger of their trade in Italy being adversely affected permanently, if not entirely lost, if Italy can establish connections with new suppliers in the U.S.A. With the Government-controlled organisation of A.G.I.P., which has been growing in importance, this is a fear which rests on quite substantial grounds.So far as other countries are concerned, it would be essential that there should be no doubt about exports from Roumania, U.S.S.R., Iran and the Dutch Indies being covered. The form of the embargo will presumably normally be by way of the prohibition of all exports of oil from the countries concerned. But in view of the fact that in some cases, such as the Dutch West Indies, the exports are refined products obtained from.Venezuelan crude, and that British, Dutch and American oil companies operate in so many countries, it would be desirable in those three instances to prohibit the nationals of those countries from supplying oil to Italy. If this were done it would presumably enable the companies to set aside contracts, an essential requirement. It might also enable exports from Iran and Iraq to be held even if the Governments of those countries did not prohibit export, as all the production and exports from Iran are handled by the A.I.O.C. and in Iraq at present by the Iraq Petroleum Company, on which the big groups are represented. Action on these lines would probably also avoid any danger of supplies being furnished to Italy from Mexico, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru and Colombia, countries which have substantial production, but where the bulk of the production is controlled by the big groups.Poland has a substantial production too, but none of the big groups operates there, and normally little oil is supplied to Italy. In exceptional circumstances, however, Poland is a possible source of supply if exports were not prohibited. In this case and in those of U.S.S.R. and Roumania a definite prohibition of export is essential.A word or two may be desirable as to the position of Germany as a possible channel for ensuring supplies to Italy. Germany imports large quantities of oil, and during the past year has been endeavouring to improve the position of her stocks. It is conceivable that she might act as agent for Italy in the purchase of oil, but with her own position not too secure in this matter, it does not seem very likely that she will do so. Germany, however, is normally an exporter of lubricating oils and if supplies from the U.S.A. and Russia the normal sources-were cut off, Germany might furnish some supplies of this essential commodity. It would, therefore, be desirable to secure the co-operation of Germany.Petroleum Department, Board of Trade, November 20, 1935.
sANNEX II.Proposal IV (a).Geneva, November 6, 1935. In the execution of the mission entrusted to it under the last paragraph of Proposal IV, the Committee of Eighteen submits to Governments the following proposal :  It is expedient that the measures of embargo provided for in Proposal IV should be extended to the following articles as soon as the conditions necessary to render this extension effective have been realised :-.Petroleum and its derivatives, by-products and residues;Pig-iron; iron and steel (including alloy steels), cast, forged, rolled, drawn, stamped or pressed;Coal (including anthracite and lignite), coke, and their agglomerates, as well as fuels derived therefrom.If. the replies received by the Committee to the present proposal and the information at its disposal warrant it, the Committee of Eighteen will propose to Governments a date for bringing into force the measures mentioned above.ANNEX   III.Press Statement made by Mr. Cordell Hull, Secretary of State, Washington,November 15, 1935.&quot; In view of the many enquiries that are being asked from time to time with respect to trade with Ethiopia and Italy, I deem it proper again to call attention to the statement by the President on the 5th October that he desired it &apos; to be understood that any of our people who voluntarily engage in transactions of any character with either of the belligerents do so at their own risk.3&quot; On the 10th October I explained that the Presidents statement was based primarily upon the policy and purpose of keeping this country out of war and that &apos; it certainly was not intended to encourage transactions with the belligerents.&apos; I further explained that &apos; our people might well realise that the universal state of,business uncertainty and suspense on account of the war is seriously handicapping business between all countries, and that the sooner the war is terminated the sooner the restoration and stabilisation of business in all parts of the world, which is definitely more important than trade with the belligerents, will be brought about.&apos; The President, in a statement on the 30th October, further emphasised the spirit of this policy.&quot;The American people are entitled to know that there are certain com-modities, such as oil, copper, trucks, tractors, scrap iron and scrap steel, which are essential war materials, although not actually arms, ammunition or implements of war, and that according to recent Government trade reports a considerably increased amount of these is being exported for war purposes. This class of trade is directly contrary to the policy of this Government, as announced in the official statements of the President and the Secretary of State, as it is also contrary* to the general spirit of the recent Neutrality Act.&quot; The Administration is closely observing the trend and volume of exports to those countries, and within a few days the Department of Commerce expects to have complete detailed lists of all commodities exported to the belligerents which will enable exact comparison with lists for the same period last year.&quot;* The words in italics were not. included in the-text circulated by the President of the Co-ordination Committee.
ANNEX: IV.A decree was issued by the German Government on the 9th November rendering the export from Germany of many kinds of goods subject to export licence. The following are the chief classes of goods concerned: oilseeds, potatoes, textile raw materials, tanning materials,&apos; resin, rubber, bacon, animal fats, butter, wool, hides and skins, vegetable fats, margarine, tallow, fish oil, graphite, asbestos, bauxite, ores and mineral.ashes, tar, pitch and coal distillation products, mineral oil, glycerine, textile waste and semi-manufactures, pig iron, iron bars, semis, sections, hoop iron, plates, wire, permanent way material, aluminium, zinc, tin, nickel and non-ferrous alloys.2. The prohibition comes into force on the 16th November, 1935, with the exception of products mentioned in paragraph 13 of the list contained in the decree, which require an export licence with effect from the 25th November, 1935.3. At the same time a proclamation was issued empowering the Control Boards concerned to issue export licences for the above goods. Export licences for peat, coal, coke and various metal waste products will, however, continue to be issued as up to the present.4.   The following press communique was also issued at the same time : &quot; Press Communique.&apos;: In the decree issued by the German Government prohibiting the export of important foodstuffs and industrial raw materials, the foodstuffs affected are all kinds of edible fats and oils, as well as potatoes; the chief kinds of industrial raw materials concerned are raw materials for the textile industry, and iron and metal industries and the rubber industries, as well as hides and skins and oils of all kinds. The decree does not include coal and copper, the export of which has been controlled for some time.&quot; The new export prohibitions have the object of taking into account the internal economic necessities of Germany. In the last few weeks there has been an increasing tendency for the export of the foodstuffs and raw materials mentioned, to the countries around Germany. Margarine has been bought up and exported. In the case of potatoes, the fact that Germany has not had the usual plentiful harvest calls for caution. &quot;With regard to industrial raw materials (except iron), Germany has never been an exporting country, but, on the contrary, an importing country. It is therefore quite uneconomic if these raw materials are now suddenly exported from Germany. In addition, world market prices for most of the products mentioned show a rising tendency. Germany would probably, therefore, only be able to replace any exported raw materials at higher prices and by utilising additional foreign exchange. In view of the present position of Germany with regard to raw materials and foreign exchange, it is clear that such exports are contrary to her general economic interests. On the other hand exports could not be prevented up to the present by the authorities concerned owing to the lack of legal provisions. It is therefore essential to create the legal basis necessary to prevent or control such exports. This is the purpose of the new decree.&quot; From the above remarks it will also been seen that the export control for the&apos;goods mentioned is not intended as a permanent measure of German trade policy, but shall only apply as long as the special circumstances prevail which have led to this step. The export prohibition for iron semi-manufactures and rolling mill products is intended to serve the special purpose of ensuring the execution of international industrial arrangements made by private industrial concerns.      ., .&quot;Traffic connected with stocks held in Germany and free harbour transactions will not be affected by the export prohibitions. The prohibitions come into force on the 16th November, 1935, except the export prohibition on iron, which takes effect for technical reasons only from the 25th November, 1935.&quot;[12370]c
