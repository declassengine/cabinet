OjpjflDENTIAL. A.O. 357.BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.&quot; STATE OE TRADE - OCTOBER, 1955 ..Summary of rex^erts submitted by members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some cases with statistical information from other sources).OVERSEAS TRADE.        Imports in october  at  73.4 m. were  4.6 i, more than in October last year.      Two-thirds of the increase was due to an increase in food and raw materials.    Of the increase of fili- in. in manuf3,ctured goods nearly  -g- m. wsis in respect of non-ferrous metals and over  300,000 relafed to chemicals, drugs, dyes and colours.Exports of United Kingdom produce at  39*9 m. were higher than in any month since November,  1930.     The total increase over a year ago was  3.1 m. and the increase for   , manufactured goods alone was  2.1 m.&quot; Re-exports amounted to  4.7 m., an increase of  700,000 over October, 1934.EMPLOYjlEMT.      The total number of unemployed persons on the registers of Employment Exchanges at 21st October was 1,916,390, a decreaseef 42,220 as compared with 23rd September.The main variations were:-London ............. 4- 3j601South Eastern ......+ 3,533SoLith Western ...... + 6,903Midlands........... - 14,277North Eastern              - 20,756North Western ...... - 12,187Scotland ........... - 6,046Wales ............     - 2,991The estimated number of insured persons aged 16-64 in employment at 21st October was 10,492,000.     This was 14,000more than a month earlier and 279,000 more than a year ago --1-
2 hi 3An improvement in employment was recorded in coal mining, the cotton, woollen and worsted,  linen and hosiery industries, textile bleaching, printing and dyeing9 most of the clothing trades (including boot and shoe manufacture), engineering,  shipbuilding and ship-repairing, motor vehicle and aircraift industries,  certain food manufacturing industries and the dock and harbour services.      On the other hand there was a decline in the distributive trades, the hotel services, the building industry, brick and tile manufacture, the shipping service,  and the tramway and omnibus services.EAILY/AY TRAFFIC.    During the four weeks ended 27th October railway traffic receipts increased by  279? 000 (2.47/^) as collared with the corresponding period of 1934-.   The increase amounted to 1.44/7&quot; in passenger traffic, 7*33^ in coal, coke, etc., and 1.03/0 in freight train traffic.      The total receipts for the 43 weeks ended 27th October amounted to  125-0 m. as against  124.1 m. for the same period of 1934.SHIPPING.      The Chamber of Shipping index number for freights (1913 ^ 100) was 93.97 as against 80.13 in September and 83.85 in October,  1934.    -There is some doubt, however, whether this improvement will continue.BANKING.      Money has been a little less plentiful, although conditions during the month were never tight.The Treasury bill rate rose (with fluctuations) from 10s.9d. at the end of September to 12s.lid. at the middle of the month, the rise being clue partly to the unsettled political situation and partly to the reluctance of the Clearing Banks to buy January bills;    on the 25th the rate fell to 11s.9d.,  owing apparently to the demand by the banks for bills from the Market.
L 0In the foreign exchange market a persistent demand for dollars caused an appre ciati-on early - in October of the, spot rate to 4.89-1-;    the weakness of sterling apparently brought about British Control intervention and on the 17th the rate was 4.925, but commercial buying of dollars brought it back to 4.91-J in the last week of the month. The French franc was fairly steady round about 74-g-; forward francs have been weak,  the immediate financial and political outlook in Paris being viewed with some doubt. The guilder improved during the month.With the appreciation of the dollar there were large shipments of gold to New York both from this country and France, but towards the end of the month shipments were restricted.C0AL-1   The average weekly output during the 13 weeks ended 26th October was 4,109,000 tons as compared with 4,171,000 tons in the corresponding period of 1934 - an Increase of 0.4 *.    The average number of wage earners employed was 747,700.Exports in October amounted to 3,286,000 tons as compared with 3,630,000 tons last year.    Reduced exports to Italy accounted for practically all the decrease, smaller decreases in exports to South America, Canada, Belgium, France, Algeria, Sweden and Norway being offset by increases to the Irish Free State, Germany, Denmark and Egypt.-IRON AND - ;STjBMi.    The market was active during October. Nearly all &quot;branches of the industry are certain to he busy for several months and in some departments it is difficult to obtain early deliveries.      Owing to the strength of demand the Cartel&apos;s quota on the British market will be
increased by 10,000 tons per month for two (or possibly six) months and this increased tonnage will not he deducted from subsequent quotas.    Pig iron business has expanded? most consumers have covered their forward requirements over the first quarter of 1956 and some producers have accepted orders up. to the end of the second and third quarters.    New business in semi-finished steel is considerable.    The irregularity in finished steel reported in September has disappeared and an expansion of export business has accentuated the somewhat tight conditions.SjOOTLAND.    The works have orders which will ensure a steady output for some months,- mainly because of contracts recently secured by Clyde shipbuilders. Constructional engineers are likely to maintain the present high level of activity during the next few months.    Boiler-makers have good orders in hand and anticipate attractive contracts in the near future.    There is a strong demand for semi-finished material.NORTH-BAST COAST.&apos;.   Producers are better employed now than at any other time this year.      Pig iron producers are heavily sold ahead - largely for the home market which offers better prices than the overseas markets. Constructional engineers are well employed.    The demand for rails, particularly tramway rails, has improved.    Plate manufacturers are fairly busy and anticipate better shipbuilding orders.SHEFFIELD.    The steel trades are producing record amounts.    The scarcity of billets and other semi-finished materials may render the usual Christmas break impossible
s) O Qtills year.    There is a demand for wire, rod and strip, stainless steel and aircraft steels, and also for railway rolling stock and marine steel forgings and castings.    A scarcity of skilled men is reported, particularly among the higher grades of craftsmen,SOUTH WALES.    There has teen a general increase in activity and some works are operating at capacity.    The shipbuilding position has brought a Letter domestic demand for heavy material.      The tin-plate trade is somewhat quiet, owing to the restriction of exports by the International Syndicate.    The export demand for galvanised sheets has improved.EWG-INEERINO:.    The volume of current and prospective activity in the industry is well maintained.    The industry attach considerable importance to the extensive programme of development works on the main railway lines to be carried out during the next five years.Exports of machinery in October amounted to  3.6 m. as against  5.14 m. in October, 1934.MOTOR INDUSTRY.    The number of motor vehicles newly registered in September was&quot;25,515, or 6,714 more than in September, 1934,  the increase comprising 6,242 private cars and 472 other vehicles.The estimated production of motor cars and taxis for the eleven months ended 31st August was 287,000 as against 242,000 in the same period of the 1933/34- season The estimated production of commercial vehicles for the eleven months period was 85,300 as against 78,600 in 1933/54.    September sales of motor cars were 6,242 more than in September, 1954, representing an increase of nearly 49$&amp;,
9? QDuring the first nine months of 1935 new motor vehicle exports increased hy 7,308 units to a total of 49,061. Compared with a year ago the September total increased by 463;    private car exports increased by 21.5%, but commercial vehicle exports declined by 15.7$.      Imports of complete private cars were 420 less in September than in September,  1934.LIGHT METaL INDUSTRIES.      In non-ferrous metals, most of the mills producing tubes,  sheets, rods and wire have been well employed.    There has been a steady expansion in the cutlery,  silver end electro-plate trades, Christmas business and exports showing an improvement over  last year.      The tool trades are well employed and in some sections there is a boom. The lock and allied trades are very busy and satisfactory conditions continue in the press work, enamelled hollow-ware and foundry trades.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.      All sections of the industry experienced another month of increased activity.Heavy engineering works have large orders on hand, but there appears to be a lull in the placing of further large orders.      Light material is in good demand.It is expected that the industry will have an important share in carrying out the recently announced scheme for main line railway development.Consumption of electricity in October amounted to 1,650 m.  units,  an increase of 15.1 per cent,  over October,  1934. The aggregate increase for the first ten months of this year, when compared with 1934, amounted to 12.7 per cent.SILK AND ARTIFICIAL SILK.      Business in rayon yarns is  quiet owing to uncertainty as to the removal of the Excise duty.The hosiery end underwear trades are normal for the time of the year, but the warp knitting trade is rather disappointing.
2P% ftThere has been a definite falling off in business in rayon piece goods;    forward bookings are affected by the Excise duty position.The silk spinning industry continues to be very fully Occupied with yarns for the liosiery trade.The price of raw silk has further increased and the Canton market is rapidly advancing.      The position as regards Italian raw silk is, of course, affected by the international si situation.COTTON.      In October there was a more than seasonal revival in activity - felt in all sections of the cotton industry.      Average weekly deliveries of raw cotton to spinners were 25.57 m.  lbs.  as compared with 20,82 m.   lbs. in September;    takings of American and Egyptian increased, but takings of Indian and other growths were reduced.      The stronger demand was largely due to a rise in cotton prices. The upward price movement ceased when the new American and Egyptian crop estimates were issued in the middle of the month.Prices of yarns, both American and Egyptian, have risen and spinners&apos; margins have improved.Yarn exports at 12.6 m.   lbs.  were higher than in September (10.1 m. )  and October, 1934 (10.9 m. )  or any month since January;    the increase over the previous month was spread over all the leading markets except Holland.      Exports of piece goods were 161.1 m.   so., yards - 10.8 m. more than in September but 14.5 m.   less than a year ago.      South Africa, British West Africa,  the Irish Free State, Australia, Ceylon, Egypt and the British West Indies were mainly responsible for the increase; Argentina, New Zealand, Denmark and India took less than in September.      There is some prospect of an increase in exports to markets such as Egypt, Argentina and Yugoslavia which may be closed to Italy following the Geneva decisions.
WOOL.      There was a further general improvement in the activity of the industry during October.      Exports of tops increased considerably as compared with September, greatly increased quantities being taken by Canada, Germany and Sweden.      Exports of yarns also increased.      Prices of raw wool hardened.The colder weather has stimulated repeat orders for the winter trade and it seems likely that the recent rate of activity may be maintained for the rest of the year.HIDES AND LEATHER TRADE.      Prices of hides reached their peak in the middle of October and are now slightly easier.There was a further increase in activity in the leather industry during October.      Better business was done at the Annual Shoe and Leather Pair held in October than in any recent year.      Sole and most upper leathers were in good demand.      The export trade showed signs of improvement.CHEMICALS.      Sales of alkali in the home market and shipments overseas during October were better than for any previous month this year.      Deliveries of chlorine products and most of the industrial nitrogen products in both the home and export trades continue at a satisfactory level. Home sales of dyestuffs showed a substantial increase over those for October,  1934,  and export sales, were maintained. Sulphate of ammonia sales in  the home market were lower in comparison with last year, but buyers have still not placed their orders for forward delivery;    exports  sales to Empire markets for 1935/36 show an increase.Enquiries for coal tar   products increased, though actual orders were small.      Trade continued quiet in wood distillation products, but there has been a very fair degree of activity in pharmaceutical products.
29 9POTTERY.    The.industry.as a whole continued to record the improvement shown previously.    In the china-wa-re section orders for the Christmas trade have come in fairly satisfactory. The demand for sanitary ware of fire clay was definitely better than last year;    in other sections of the industry it was satisfactory.RETAIL TRADE.    The money value of retail sales in September was 8.1% greater than in September,  1934.    All areas shared in this improvement.    Sales of food and perishables continued to expand,  the increase for September being 8.6$ as compared with a rise of 6.4$ for February to August..    Sales of other merchandise increased by 7.5$ during September as against 3.4$ for February to August.    Sales of piece goods (which fell in August) resumed their advance with the rise of 3.5$.CANADIAh TRADE.  In September there was a moderate recession in business from the high level reached in August, the index figures of the physical volume of business being 101.9 and 10709,  respectively.    The index of exports dropped from 100.3 to 92.7.    Exports of nickel and the better grades of asbestos increased, but exports of copper and zinc were smaller.    Imports of bauxite declined markedly from the high level of August and there were decreases in imports of raw and semi-manufactured materials for the textile industries and of crude rubber (mainly used in tyre manufacture).The manufacture of foodstuffs increased, mainly owing to activity in milling.    Newsprint production and exports of wood pupp,  &quot;planks and boards    decreased.    There was a more than seasonal decline in the value of contracts awarded and the increase in imports of crude petroleum was less than normal at this time of the year.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.    967,000 bales of wool were receivedinto store from 1st July to 30th September as compared with958,000 a year ago,  and 256,000 were sold or shipped as against164,000 last season.    Wheat and flour shipments for the period December to 23rd October are equivalent to 93.3 m.  bushels of.-9-
wheat as against 83.9 m. bushels,      Exports of butter for the period 1st July to 25th October now amount to 19,200 tons as compa red with 20,700 tons a year ago.      The total imports of merchandise during September were valued at  8.17 m. (Australian currency)   as compared with  7.86 m.  in September,  1934.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE. Argentina.      Although abundant rains have improved prospects the  crops have been infested by locusts  and will be below normal.      Cereal prices have eased slightly. According to an official forecast the acreages under wheat, linseed, oats, barley and rye for 1935/36 will be considerably less then in the previous year,  the reductions ranging from 4$ for barley to  2b% for wheat.      On the wool market supplies are short and small lots of new wool which have arrived are of poor quality owing to the drought.    Sugar production for 1934/35 was 8.2% greater than in the previous season.      Germany, which has taken practically no Argentine beef since 1950, has now granted an annual import quota of 25,000 tons.Exports in September were lower than a year ago. Exports in the period January - September exceeded imports by nearly $300 million, but the export surplus is unlikely to be much increased in the remaining months of the year. Figures of imports from the United Kingdom this year show an absolute increase over 1934,  though the United Kingdom proportion of the total imports is slightly lower at 22%. The percentage imp or t from Japan rose from 2.1% to 4.3%,Operations of the Government exchange fund counteracted the effect wnich unfavourable crop prospects would normally have- had on the peso,        A Bill has been approved autriori sing expenditure of $50 million (to be
appropriated from the Exchange Profits Fund) for the construction of a chain of grain elevators.    It is inferred from this that the Government does not intend to abolish exchange control for some considerable  time.Brazil,    It now appears that the yield of coffee for the current and next seasons&apos;  crops will he less than anticipated.    Coffee exports continue at a higher level than last year.There is little business on the cotton market, hut it remains firm.    Textile mills are well employed,A movement in the &quot;free&quot; exchange rate during October from 80/ 750 to 87/ 100 is attributed partly to the European political situation, but the uncertainty in the Brazilian exchange markets recently has been largely due to the big volume of commercial debts awaiting remittance.      The situation may he improved following Executive approval of the scheme for liquidation of frozen British credits and better methods of administration of exchange control.Chile,    Internal markets are active and export trade good.    It seems likely that 1955 will prove to he the best year for a long time.    Imports (mainly owing to purchases of machinery and raw materials) show a much greater increase than exports.Peru.    The cotton market has been firm.Imports in the first seven months this year show an increase and exports a decrease as compared with 1931.Colombia.    There has been increased activity in the coffee market and New York prices have risen cons icier ally, hut a fall in exchange rates has counteracted the &quot;benefit of the New York rise.    Coffee exports for the first eight months of this year are about 10% higher than last year.    Total exports in the first seven months this year were about 16^ less than last year, but total imports were nearly 50% greater.
Uruguay.      The agreement for the allocation of exchange arising from exports to the United Kingdom is working extremely well.In the first six months of this year total exports were about 50% greater and total imports about 15$ less than last year.
