BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos; S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO. . ^1&apos;^CABINET.&apos;^MITTIIl-ON THE REPORTS OF THE COMMIESlOEERS FOR THE SPECIAL AREAS;.:REPORT.1, Early in July last the Prime Minister requested theCabinet Committee, which,  in pursuance of Cabinet 34 (34),had considered the Reports of the Investigators into theDepressed Areas, to examine the Reports of the Commissionersfor the Special Areas in England and Wales and Scotlandrespectively and to report thereon to the Cabinet.Lord Eustace Percy accepted the Prime Minister&apos;invitation to become a member of the Committee, the compos-ition of which was accordingly as followsThe Chancellor of the Exchequer      (Chairman) The Secretary of State: for Scotland The President of the Board of Trade The Minister without Portfolio The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries The Minister of Health The Minister of Labour The First Commissioner cf Works.2a The Report of Mr, P.M.  Stewart,  the Commissioner forthe Special Areas in England and Wales was circulated tothe Cabinet by the Minister of Labour on 11th July last(CP.  140  (35))  and on 12th July the Secretary of State forScotland circulated to the Cabinet the Report of Sir ArthurRose,  the Commissioner for the Special Areas in Scotland. (CP.  141 (35)).3. The Cabinet Committee referred the Commissioners&apos;Reports to an Inter-Departmental Committee under the Chairman ship of Sir Horace Wilson;    towards the end of September the Cabinet Committee received the Inter-Departmental Committee&apos;s Report.
4. A copy of this last named Report and coveringNote by the Chairman is attached (Appendix JC).    The Report is concerned both with the Reports  of the Commissioners and with a number of proposals put forward in other ways for dealing with the situation,&apos;    Owing to the very large numbers of detailed recommendations and comments with which the Inter-Departmental Committee had to deal, their Report is somewhat lengbhy and technical.      In its&apos; opening pages will be found a summary indicating the points for decision by Ministers;    these points are grouped into (a)  those suggestions of the Commissioners which under existing policy or Departmental authority could be accepted in whole or in part;    (b)  suggestions which seem open to consider-able objection,  or on which difficulties arise;    and (c)  suggestions which seem open to serious objection.&apos;5. We have given very full and detailed considerationto the recommendations and suggestions contained in the Commissioners&apos; Reports and to the other proposals,  and the conclusions we have reached on-the numerous points on which Ministerial decision was required are summarised in Appendix II to this Report.      It will be seen that we are very largely in agreement with the views expressed in the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee and in Sir Horace Wilson1s  covering Note to that Report.6. We recommend the Cabinet to approve the conclusionssummarised in Appendix II  to this Report.      We regret that owing to the nature of the subject matter with which we have had to deal,  it should be necessary to trouble the Cabinet with a mass of detail,  the individual items 3f which vary greatly In importance.    We  think, however,   that while the Cabinet should have the whole of the facts before them for purposes of information and record, they will wish tj have from us a broad statement   v &apos; covering the;&apos;impressions we have formedand the general conclusions we have reached as a result
of our examination of the whole problem.7. Our first impression is  that nothing like enoughhas keen made of what the - Commissioners have accomplished in rather less than-a year from taking up office,      In our opinion the Report for the Commissioner for England and &quot;Wales underrates the very considerable measure of success&apos; which has attended Mr. StewartTs efforts.    At the outset the Commissioners accepted the view that tne problem of the Special Areas was not capable of being solved by a few large and spectacular remedies, but was rather one to be tackled in many separate ways and from many different angles, and in particular by testing out a large number of miscellaneous remedies.      An account of the work of the Commissioners will be found on pages 9-20 of the Inter-Departmental Committeers Report..     An examination of this account shows conclusively the absurdity of the allegation that the Commissioners have failed.      In any case it would,  in our view, be very premature to reach such a conclusion after the lapse of so short a time.      The Commissioners are continually experiment-ing and their activities go on expanding with growing cumulative effect.      This novel administrative venture has made an excellent start and the experiments which the Commissioners have been trying out are proving most valuable in showing the best ways for future advance and also those which should be avoided.8. The Reports of the Commissioners do not,  of course,refer to the new Defence programme, but  that programme is going to be a very powerful factor in removing from the map parts of the Special Areas, particularly in North-east england and in Scotland.    In this way the problem will be-narrowed and the number of those who complain that the Government has done nothing for them will be materially reduced.
^gjggggmtKKKmmummimmmm..........9. We do not believe that the introduction of new industries into the depressed areas is going to play any very large part in the near future in solving the problem of those areas.      Speaking generally we doubt the feasibility of trying to persuade ordinary industry to go into the Special Areas.      The influences telling in other directions seem to be too strong.      If it were possible to establish one or more Government factories in the areas - a matter which is under consideration - a useful lead would be given and in time private employers might also go there.10. What policy should be adopted in the case of theunemployed in the Special Areas who cannot find work either in old or new industries in those areas?11. In the first place we think that as many as possible of these people should be settled on the land.    The Commissioners&apos; Reports show that settlement can be effected in a great variety of ways - though not on a spectacular scale - and that -in many of these ways a promising start has already been made.      Secondly,  the younger men and women and the juveniles should be encouraged to transfer to more prosperous districts and any necessary extensions of the Ministry of Labour training schemes should be put In hand at once.      In order that a transfer policy may be successful the country as a whole must be prosperous.      In the view of the Chancellor of the Exchequer the economic and financial position of the country is not at present unsatisfactory, and he has no reason to suppose that the present general prosperity will not continue.      We attach great importance to the energetic prosecution of the transfer policy.      Finally, there will remain those persons for whom there will be no employment and who cannot, for one reason or another, be moved out of the Special Areas.    The Government&apos;s policy should be to make life for these people more tolerable,  to keep them as contented and happy as circumstances permit,  and
jl y jto endeavour to ensure that this ultimate residuum is kept as small as possible.    It must, however, be remembered that persons in this category are not peculiar to the Special Areas;    they are to be  found,  of course,  in every part of the country.12. Great care will have to be taken in the public presentation of the Government&apos;s policy.      We suggest that such presentation should be on the following lines: As much as possible should be made of what has already been done for the Special Areas by the Commissioners and others,, with the active co-operation and assistance of the Government. The impression must be created and fostered that the various activities and schemes are having a rapidly increasing and cumulative effect.    It is the intention of the Government that these activities should be continued and extended. Emphasis should be laid on the invaluable con-tribution which the carrying out of the Defence programme will make towards the solution of the problem in important parts of the Special Areas.Attention should be drawn to the fact that the improved conditions in the rest of the country afford an opportunity of which it is intended to take full advantage - to train those who are unemployed and to place them in employment in trades and districts where conditions are more favourable.It is most important to avoid any suggestion that the Government have in reserve some sovereign remedy for the problem of the Special Areas which they will make public after the General Election.
13. We accordingly submit to the Cabinet the following recommendations and conclusions  :-(l)  That approval should be given to our conclusions as set out in Appendix.11 on the recommendations in the  Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee.(2) That the Government ,:s policy in regard to&apos;the Special Areas should be presented on the lines suggested in the concluding paragraph of this Report.(3) To take note of the general Impressions which we have formed as a result of our study of the problem, and which are set out in paragraphs 7 to 11 of this Report.Signed on behalf of the Committee.N.

REPORT Off INTER-DEPARTMENT AL COMMITTEE ON SPECIAL AREAS.
SECRET. D.A. (54)4.COPY NO.CABINET.Committee on the Reports of the Commissioners for the Special Areas.Report of Inter-Departmental. Committee.Note &quot;by the Chairman.Attached is a report &quot;by the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Reports by the Commissioners for the Special Areas and on a number of proposals put forward in other ways for dealing with the situation.    Owing to the number of detailed recommendations and comments both in the Reports of the Commissioners and in the other proposals, the Report is somewhat lengthy.     In addition to a grouped contents table there has been added a summary of the Report indicating points for consideration and decision by Ministers.      To facilitate consideration these points have been grouped provisionally into (a) those suggestions of the Commissioners which under existing policy or Departmental authority could be accepted in whole or in part;    (b) suggestions which seem open to considerable objection, or on which difficulties arise;    and (c) suggestions which seem open to serious objection.The discussions on the Committee suggest the following general commentary. The Powers of the Commissioner.The Government lias been criticised for limiting the Commissioners1 powers in various ways;    the Commissioner for England and Wales refers to the matter.(a) No ] -iniits have been set on the amount of money that the Commissioners may spend, if they can spend the money usefully, for the social or economic improvement of the Areas.     The Commissioners have already accepted commitments in excess of the original amount of the Vote taken for them, and they know that as they find really useful things to do they will have the money to do them.(b) They cannot put in hand pure 1relief works&apos;.     This is a limitation of policy, and not of law, and both Commissioners approve of the policy, and, indeed, rest their recommendations upon the policy.(c) Mr. Stewart complains that he cannot, from his own funds, increase the amount of grant that the appropriate Department would give to a Local Authority.     f. &apos; &apos; &apos;THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOTORNMENT.....
for work that the Authority declares itself unable to finance upon the terms whichthe Department considers appropriate.      It is an elementary precaution in public expenditure not to finance any service simultaneously from two sources.Similarly Mr. Stewart complains of a technical prohibition on the financing of work on which a Department is not prepared to spend Exchequer money, though fiit may have statutory power to do so. JL i? c3Both difficulties can be met to a reasonable extent (see Para. 172) if the Commissioner,    after due consideration, chooses to make a recommendation to the appropriate Department.     It is for the Commissioner to satisfy himself that the work is really worth doing at the price, and that the   difficulties of the Authority are genuine.     Unless the Commissioner accepts the position that the responsibility for putting a value on the work is his, and that a Department would hesitate to refuse a considered and reasonable recommendation, much of the value of the Commissioner1 s power to &quot;experiment&quot; will be wasted.      It might be advisable to announce that if the Commissioner^ recommendations are acceptable to the Department concerned, the necessary arrangements will he made to provide the necessary money through the Departmental Vote.(d) The Commissioner cannot assist profit-making industry.     The reasonsfor this limitation - with which Mr. Stewart agrees - are obvious; its importance is discussed below.(e) It is suggested that the powers of the Commissioner to initiate measures outside the Special Areas, but for their benefit, have been limited in practice. But there is nothing to prevent the Commissioner initiating measures involving work outside the Areas if he is satisfied that those measures result in the social or economic improvement of the Area or will give substantial employment to people from the Area.     Here again the matter is one for the Commissioner.The achievements of the Commissioners.It was intended that the Commissioners should have power to experiment over a wide field,  and their Reports show that they have been able to develop activities in the Areas of many and diverse kinds.     These activities are con-tinuing and expanding.     The Commissioner for England and Wales in his report says that &quot;the effect of the assistance afforded in.many directions, and of the grants made, should be increasingly felt and prove of permanent advantage to the Special Areas,&quot; and the Commissioner for Scotland states that &quot;The number of
, schemes still under consideration is so large that I anticipate a rapidly increasing expenditure.&quot;     The details of what they have done and what they are considering are described briefly in the accompanying Report, and the description is both interesting in itself and indicative of the nature of the problem and of the many ways in which it can be tackled;    the range of the activities can be illustrated as follows:-Industrial development.     Grants for the clearance of sites, grants to local Development Councils, including grants for research into the production of oil from coal, approaches to private firms.Public Works. Hospitals, sewerage, water schemes.Social improvements.      The work of the National Council of Social Service and of bodies associated with it is being financed and very largely increased and proposals are being, worked out to strengthen the organisation.-    Assistance is being given to the Scottish Council for Community Service.     Grants for district nurses, for the provision of holiday camps for boys and girls (some 20,000 boys aril girls will have attended these camps this year, many by arrangement with the Education Authorities during term), for centres and holiday camps for women - a scheme which helped to meet a need that many social workers in the Areas have stressed - social centres for young men, and grants for cultural activities, a matter of importance particularly in South Wales, where very likely it would be wise to give considerably larger aid   of this kind.Agriculture.      Through the Land Settlement Association Mr. Stewart is pressing on with experiments for settling 2,000 unemployed men on snail holdings. This is the maximum experiment that the Association -and the Commissioner consider to be wise;    there seems to be general agreement that land settlement must, as Mr. Stewart says, bo &quot;started in a cautious way&quot;.     Part of the present plan (which is frankly experimental) is the continuance during the first year of unemployment allowances at the ordinary rate from the Unemployment Assistance Board.In addition, part-subsistence holdings and allotments are being encouraged -in Scotland as well as in England and Wales - and also the experiments of Mr. Peter Scott to establish snail self-contained cons-unities on the land.The Commissioners are examining further land settlement schemes which are mentioned in the Report (paras. 55 - 58 and 76 - 78).
&apos; The p os it ion of imc mployiriont in the Special Areas, and the effect of the Oommissioners &apos; efforts upon the problem.The following unemployment figures tell their own tale.February, 1934.Augus 13 1934.February, 1935.August, 1935.N.E. Area West Cumberland South Wales Sco tland200,921 13,607 165,745 108,034182,867 12,017153,639 97,405200,262 13,437 164,167 104,489189,016 11,491147,998 93,941TOTAL488,307445,928482,355442,446&apos;    The plain fact is that the improvement in the employment position generally has not been accompanied by a corresponding improvement in the Special Areas. On the other hand, the continuance of improvement in the iron and steel industry, and improvement in shipbuilding which may slowly come and will in any case result from a navy programme, will help the coastal area of the 1\T.E. special area and the Scottish areas;    there is indeed ground for hoping that these districts may cease to need special attention.     But in the S.W. Durham coalfield, in the inland part of the Cumberland area, and, in particular, in the South Wales area, it is the continued and probably inevitable decline of coal mining which dominates the position;   and there is nothing in sight to suggest any material improvement.Mr. Stewart criticises the existing coal policy, but his criticisms are answered in paras. 87-94.     As a business man he admits that a logical and economic coal policy (and this is equally true of iron and steel) will concentrate production in profitable areas - and that many of his areas cannot be described as profitable.He recognises also that any policy of public works is a stop-gap.     It costs about one million pounds to give work for a year to 4,000 men, and when the work is done, there is nothing else, unless the ordinary industry of the areas has in the meantime either revived or been replaced by other ordinary industry.     Public works (naturally hard to find anywhere in the country now in view of the amount spent on them, in the past 14 years) have been found to be few in number in the Areas themselves.      (The new Road Programme will, of course, help here to some extent).Mr. Stewart has tried to interest ordinary industry in the economic possibilities of the area, and in a valuable part of his Report (paras. 200-206),
he calls attention to the purchasing power existing in the population of the areas.     (it may be noted that,  taking into account the amount of unemployment relief given, and the value of the other social services, the net annual purchasing power of the areas has been maintained at a relatively high level, the effect of unemployment being very much less than is sometimes suggested). There is available to manufacturers of consumption goods a considerable local market.Can that local market be strengthened?     One way of doing it might be to reduce the burden of rates which, since the Derating Act, falls more upon the purchaser and the provider of services, (e.g. distributive trades) than upon the manufacturer.&quot;.     The Commissioner does not attach much importance to the level of rates as a chock upon manufacturing enterprise, though he considers that they have a -psychological effect.     They are rather a consequence of depression than a cause of it.     Questions of far-reaching policy are raised by this and allied suggestions and if the subject - which is a very complex one - is to be considered \ further, as seems to be necessary, it should perhaps be examined separately byjthe Departments concerned - the Treasury, Ministry of Health, Scottish Office and the Unemployment Assistance Board.Can manufacturing industry be compelled or induced to establish itself in the Special Areas, particularly in the more &quot;derelict&apos; parts of them?     TheiCommissioner for England and Wales rejects the idea of compulsion against the current of economic facts (para. 194- of his Report), but in para. 196   he contemplates a measure of control over the source of labour engaged by new factories.      This is discussed in the next section on Transfer.The Commissioners have also raised the question of the provision of finance, on preferential terms, for manufacturers deciding to begin or expand operations in the Special Areas.There is considerable doubt as to wheat is the real difficulty in the provision of finance for &quot;small&quot; industries, and some controversy about the adequacy of the existing financial arrangements.     Further examination of this -question suggests that the creation of any new financial instrument, specially designed for the pur-pose of investing capital in a -number of small and speculative enterprises, if such an instrument can In fact be created, would have little real effect -upon the unemployment problem;    at the same time the natter is one that has caused much comment, leading to a belief that there exists a potential
expansion of snail industries if only the necessary money were forthcoming, and it my be desirable therefore to have the matter examined again, not upon the assumption that the Government would participate, but upon the charge that the existing financial institutions, dealing mainly in credit for limited periods, do not meet the needs of an area which wants more capital, in small amounts, and is out of touch with the machinery which could provide the capital.      Since his Report was published, Mr. Stewart has written recommending special finance and the matter cannot very well be left where it now is. Transfer.The study of the problem by the Commissioners enforces the conclusion drawn previously (for example in the Report of the Industrial Transference Board in 1928) that when all has been done that a Covernment, working through Local Authorities and public utility authorities, can properly do, the position remains that either ordinary work in ordinary industry mast be brought to the people in those areas, or the people must be brought to other areas of the country where, as the past year has shown, there is steady improvement in the opportunities and prospects of employment.To remove the older men from the employment market by pensions is prohibitive in expense;    further it merely alters their description, substituting the term &quot;pensioner&quot; for the term &quot;unemployed&quot;.To keep children from employment until a later age may be important on educational grounds, but as indicated in paras. 227-237,  the cost as well as the industrial consequences would be disturbing, and the net effect upon unemployment not commensurate with these consequences.      In any case this question has just been considered by the Cabinet and conclusions reached.Mr. Stewart (paras. 160 et seq of his Report) recognises that transfer is &quot;one of the esssotial measures of relief&quot;, and discusses the objections to it.If its necessity is z^ecognised as clearly as Mr. Stewart admits it, the present situation contains opportunities better than have existed for several years past.     It can only succeed if it is made a definite policy, both in the Special Arenas and in the areas of better employment, and if it forms part of the policy of the Government in all questions of employment where the Government can either control the engagement of labour, or through its financial assistance to employing Authorities, can exercise influence upon the engagement of labour.
There is little doubt that a policy of transfer, forcefully presented and vigorously prosecuted, can do something effective and permanent to bring back many of the employable persons in the depressed areas into the stream of production.     The policy of transfer, while immediately it can deal only with numbers that are small im comparison with.the figures quoted above, is cumulative in its effects.     There is nothing in the present position in the Special Areas which suggests that a policy of giving work to the people in the areas can be much more than make-believe.     It is right that Mr. Stewart and Sir Arthur Rose should go on with their efforts to improve the economic position of the areas, to ensure that unemployment and local financial difficulties do not result in the social services becoming dangerously inadequate, in experimenting with land settlement, and in encouraging any communal activities which may make life more tolerable for those who may not be absorbed by any local revival that may occur or who - on account of age or other reason - cannot be moved away.     But, as. Mr. Stewart says, &quot;these are not fundamental measures of relief&quot;.      If the coal trade cannot give employment locally, and other industries with a oomparable range of employment can find no reason why they should settle themselves round derelict pit shafts, the people who wish to work must go where the work is.The Ministry of Labour training and transfer facilities are capable of expansion and the time is opportune, more especially if the general trade improvement is to be accompanied by &quot;defence&quot; orders.      It is true that there is considerable reluctance in the Special Areas - particularly in South Wales - to take advantage of these facilities, and the Ministry of Labour officers have little or no leverage with which to overcome the reluctance.     Over and above the natural human dislike of moving, the level of monetary assistance available to those who prefer to remain is so high as to prevent almost entirely any realisation of the necessity to take work in other places.     At some stage if may be necessary to point out that when opportunity of training and transfer is offered to suitable persons and they refuse it, they must be regarded as having forfeited claims to sympathy.Unemployment allowances are now adjusted so as to prevent any financial suffering through the departure of an unemployed member of the family. Other Measures.If nevertheless it is felt, as it very well may be, that (while pressing transference to the utmost extent possible) definite signs of Governmental
activity on behalf of the Areas must be evident in the Areas themselves, the material examined in the inter-Departmental Committee&apos;s Report offers a field of choice.It seems clear that the work of the Commissioners should be continued and expanded as far as practicable.     It is important to continue the local social and cultural activities, and there is much still to be done in the way of &quot;cleaning up&quot; parts of the Areas - making up ill-kept streets, etc.     Some further activity seems possible, too, on land settlement though not on a spectaoular scale.Further Exchequer assistance to Local Authorities would no doubt be popular locally - but this might involve the inclusion of areas not at present regarded as &quot;Special&quot;, and it has to be considered in association with the question of control of local administration.     This question (as suggested above) seems to need special examination.The Areas should receive a due proportion of the &quot;defence&quot; orders and of the orders arising under the Railway re-equipment plan.The best way in which the Government could signify their wish that private firms would start up in the Areas would be to establish a Government factory in one or more of them and the developments of the defence plans seems to provide the necessary opportunities.      (One aspect of this is being examined as a result of Cabinet Conclusion 1 of Cabinet 41 of the 31st July, 1935, and there may be other proposals for removal or development of Government establishments which could be looked at from the point of view of the Special Areas problem).There is a possibility of establishing a Coal Hydrogenation plant in South Wales, (this is being examined in discussion with LCI.) and the question of re-starting the Ebbw Vale Steel Works is again being examined by the Commissioner.As regards schemes outside the Areas which might be of assistance to the Areas,  the major bridge proposals do not seem to be likely to be available in the near future, except perhaps the Severn Bridge.     The general road programme should be helpful, and will to some extent give employment in the Areas themselves.The more closely the details of the problem in these Areas are examined the more clear does it become that there is no single &quot;remedy&quot; and that, apart from transference - which ought to be regarded as a major operation - the position
H.Q.799-45 I.E.can only be relieved by the application of a number of comparatively small remedies, of diverse kinds, such as those which the Commissioners have devised and are assisting.     It seems equally clear that the really effective contri-bution by Government (apart from the Social Services) is the creation and maintenance of improvement in the position of the country as a whole.     This requires to be re-stated as a preface to anything indicating further action in connection with the Special Areas;    for it both describes the foundation of the Government&apos;s employment policy (restoration of generad business confidence, cheap money, fiscal policy, etc.) and indicates the limits to which further action can go, namely, that nothing must be done to shake confidence or check business development - for unless the country as a whole is in good trim the plight of the Special Areas will indeed be bad.(Sgd.)

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTCONFIDENTIALREPORT OF INTER-DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE on special AREASSeptember, 1935
SUMMARY OF  REPORT.THE Reports by the two Commissioners on the first six months of their work which were made at the end of July, were referred to the Committee for examination. [See Paragraph 4 of Cabinet Paper D.A. (34) 6th Meeting.] It has been thought convenient to examine at the same time a number of proposals put forward in other ways.Part A of the attached report describes the work which has been done by the Commissioners up to date and indicates the further work which they have it in mind to do. The financial commitments of the Commissioner for England and Wales are  2,339,000 for activities, the total cost of which is estimated at  4,087,000.   The figures for Scotland are  862,000 and  1,700,000.Part B deals in three sections (I, II and III) with the suggestions made by the Commissioners, under the headings (a) Industry, (b) Public Works, (c) Agriculture, (d) Other measures of Social Improvement, and (e) Transference^ out of the Areas. Section I refers to those suggestions of the Commissioners-which, under existing policy or Departmental authority could be accepted in whole or in part. Section II deals with suggestions which seem open to considerable objection, or on which difficulties arise. Section III deals with suggestions which seem open to serious objection.Part C, following the same arrangement as Part B, deals with a number of suggestions put forward from various sources, e.g., the Bishop of llandaff&apos;s Committee, and the deputation of Northern Members of Parliament which the Prime Minister received in July, and also certain other suggestions, including those of the Investigators who visited the areas in 1934 which have not been adopted by the Commissioners or otherwise.Part D is concerned with the observations made by the two Commissioners with regard to the limitation of their powers.The following are the more important points referred to in Parts B and C of the Report:  Part B, Section I.[Suggestions of the Commissioners which, under existing policy or departmental authority, could be accepted in whole or in part.^(a) Industry.The change in conditions in the Areas will be considered in revising the block grant formula for 1937.  Paragraph 81.A scheme for grant aiding the formation of trading estates can be worked out.   Paragraphs 82-86.Certain of the suggestions regarding the Coal Mining Industry can be accepted in part; this subject is before the Cabinet separately. Paragraphs 87-93.The Commissioners&apos; desire to assist advertising abroad could be met by increasing the grant, borne on the Vote for the Department of Overseas Trade, to the Travel and Development Association.   Paragraph 100.The policy of directing orders to the Special Areas which was followed in connection with the guarantee to the London Passenger Transport Board for railway electrification can be followed if similar cases arise. Para-graphs 101-103.(b) Public Works.. - &apos; - - - - - - - . - - - - &apos; -A scheme for a Rural Housing Society, which is under examination, could be adopted.   Paragraph 108.Extended powers have been obtained for Scottish arterial drainage. Paragraph 109.The scheme of assisting in the establishment of military camps in the Special Areas could be developed.   Paragraph 110.The proposed Housing Society in the North-Eastern area could be established.   Paragraphs 111-119.[12152] B 2
(c) A griculture.The Commissioners&apos; schemes for land settlement can be accepted as a whole. It seems clear, and this is the view of the Commissioners, that all that is immediately practicable is being done.   Paragraph 120.Afforestation can be, to some extent, accelerated, but some of the more far-reaching proposals which have been advanced are impracticable for a number of reasons.   Paragraphs 121-127.(e) Transference.The Ministry of Labour seems to be already doing all that is practicable to meet the Commissioners&apos; desires that every inducement should be held out to those willing to transfer.   Paragraphs 128-131.The question of Overseas Migration is under discussion with those concerned.   Paragraph 133.The Ministry of Labour can arrange substantially to meet the proposals in regard to Hostels.   Paragraphs 135-136.Part B, Section II.[Suggestions which seem open to considerable objection, or on whichdifficulties arise..](a) Industry.Easier financial arrangements for new industries, particularly small ones, starting in the Special Areas. The difficulty is to avoid providing Exchequer money for particular undertakings, largely speculative, but the subject should perhaps be further examined.   Paragraphs 137-148.The proposed body to explore industrial conditions is open to the . . objections to Government planning of industrial development which were elaborated in the reply to Mr. Lloyd George.   Paragraphs 150-151.The question of the financial position of the Local Authorities in the Special Areas has been raised; it is a matter which seems to need examination by the Departments concerned.   Paragraphs 152-153.(b) Public Works.Objections to clearance of sites of no economic value by means of wages schemes instead of voluntary labour.   Paragraphs 154-159.Reasons for not removing the Commissioners&apos; inability to make grants for public works which can be grant-aided by a Government Department. Paragraphs 160-174.Various directions in which schemes of public works might be encouraged both in the Special Areas and other areas are discussed, special reference being made to such schemes as the Thames Tunnel, the Severn Bridge, and the reclamation of the Wash, &amp;c.   Paragraphs 175-196.-(e) Transference.The question arises whether additional grants should be offered to schemes outside the Special Areas on the condition that a substantial proportion of the labour is drawn from those areas.   Paragraphs 197-209.An alternative suggestion is that it might be made a condition of the receipt of Exchequer or national grants by a Local Authority (other than the block grant) that the necessary labour should be obtained through the PAnployment Exchanges, so that in suitable cases (having regard to local and other circumstances) the Ministry of Labour could consider whether some transferred labour could be employed.   Paragraphs 209-211.(f) Miscellaneous: Social Improvement.Resident Commissioners the suggestion of the Commissioner for England and Wales is met with a recommendation that its consideration should be postponed to be dealt with later in connection with the expiry of the Act.

[Suggestions which seem open to serious objection.&apos;](a) Industry.The licensing of new factories in specified industries with a view to the regulation by the Licensing Authority of the arrangements for the engage-ment of labour.   Paragraphs 213-217.The possibility of levying on industries moving from a Special Area to a new district a special rate or tax, in order to meet the cost of public services which have to be provided in consequence.   Paragraphs 218-220.This Section also deals with the suggestions of the Commissioner for England and Wales regarding : Shorter Hours.   Paragraphs 221-226. Later Entry into Industry.   Paragraphs 227-237. Earlier Retirement and Contributory Pensions.   Paragraphs 238-243.Holidays with Pay.   Paragraphs 245-251. (e) Transference.The Commissioner for England and Wales suggested that a survey of the Special Areas should be made to ascertain their industrial prospects and transference intensively applied to Areas adjudged to have no economic future.   Paragraphs 252-255.He also suggested that preference for employment out of the areas up to the age of 21 should be given to youths in the Special Areas with a good record and a national appeal made on their behalf on the lines of the King&apos;s National Roll.   Paragraphs 256-260.Part C.[Suggestions from various sources.&apos;](a) Industry.Various suggestions have been made with regard to Government contracts and to the establishment of Government factories in the Special Areas, special reference being made to the question of removing Woolwich Arsenal to South Wales and to that of a thorough examination of West Cumberland from a strategic point of view.   Paragraphs 262-267.A variety of suggestions put forward with the idea of increasing the opportunities of employment for the younger men or of stimulating industry are discussed, some of which, such as a suggestion for restriction of the employment of women and one for the offering of Government grants to firms instituting pensions schemes, seem definitely impracticable. Paragraphs 268-271.Others, such as a proposal of the Bishop of llandaff&apos;s Committee, for the introduction, or increase, of tariffs to encourage and protect existing new industries come within the scope of existing powers.   Paragraph 272.A plea for the revision of railway rates and dock dues in the Special Areas, which are claimed to be excessive, does not appear to be well-founded and it is doubtful whether a case for revision of the rates can be established. Paragraphs 273-281.(b) Public Works.Suggestions for the nationalisation of main roads and the reconstruction of weak bridges by means of a loan secured on the Road Fund are dealt with. Paragraphs 287-289.(d) Other Measures of Social Improvement.The relations of the Ministry of Labour with the National Council of Social Service are discussed.   Paragraphs 290-292.
(e) Transference.Transference has been dealt with at some length in earlier sections of the report. In this section some suggestions with regard to Training are considered. Two of these suggestions are concerned with administrative points within the competence of the Ministry of Labour, viz., the length of course of training in Government Training Centres and the provision of preparatory Training Centres.   Paragraphs 294-299.Suggestions on a variety of subjects, such as the establishment of a Regional Development Authority in the Durham and Tyneside area, the appointment of a separate Commissioner for South Wales, &amp;c, are grouped under the heading &quot; Miscellaneous.&quot;   Paragraphs 300-314.Part D.[Commissioners&apos; powers.&apos;]The limitations on the powers of the Commissioners are, for the most part, imposed by the Special Areas Act itself, and can only be removed by fresh legislation.   Other ways of overcoming such  limitations recognised as impeding the Commissioners&apos; activities are discussed in the Report under the relevant subject heads.   Paragraphs 316-333.

REPORT OF INTER-DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON SPECIALAREAS.Part A. Work of the Commissioners.I. Work in Hand, including Contemplated Extensions, as described in their first Reports (January-June, 1935).(i) England and Wales. Industry.The Commissioners are debarred by the terms of the Special Areas (Development and Improvement) Act from giving financial assistance towards the establishment of new industries operating for profit. The Commissioner for England and Wales reported, therefore, that he had confined his activities to negotiation with various industries; assistance to Development Councils; assistance to undertakings not carried on for profit.2. He approached a number of large firms in the hope of persuading them to open new branches in the Special Areas. In one case only did he receive a favourable reply, and, as negotiations were still proceeding, a new factory in one of the areas might possibly result. He circularised some 5,800 firms connected with the federation of British Industries on the possibility of their establishing a new branch in one of the Special Areas. The results were disappointing; only seven were prepared to consider the matter.3. As regards assistance to Development Councils, grants amounting to  9,500 had been promised to the South Wales and Monmouth Development Council, of which  2,500 is to be devoted to a special investigation into the production of oil from coal;  2,000 to a special survey of the area to bring up to date and develop in greater detail work done in 1931 for the Board of Trade by University College in South Wales and Monmouthshire; and  5,000 to the general work of the Council in collecting information as to industries and other resources of the area and for general propaganda in this country, including films and publicity. Grants amounting to  9,500 had been promised to the North-Eastern Development Council to assist their work, including an industrial survey of the area. Part of this amount is to be allocated to a separate District Board for South-West Durham. In West Cumberland there was at the time apart from a Development Committee for the District of Whitehaven no Development Board. As a result of the Commissioner&apos;s representations and his promise of financial assistance if such a Board were constituted, steps were being taken to form a Board, and it was hoped that it would be in a position to function at an early date.4. The Commissioner had given assistance to a number of undertakings not carried on for profit (i.e., carried on with the primary object of providing means of livelihood for persons engaged in the undertaking, with a view to their establishment in a position of independence or partial independence of Unemployment Assistance or Poor Relief). He had given  4,000 to the Brynmawr Scheme directed by Mr. Peter Scott, under which furniture and boots are produced on a Co-operative basis, and a small number of the unemployed in one of the most hard hit areas of South Wales are enabled to attain a measure of self support. In regard to the Northern Industries Bureau under direction of Lady Headlam, which gives employment to women in County Durham in production of quilting and other handicrafts, the Commissioner had given assistance towards cost of an organiser whose salary and expenses are to be met for two years up to a maximum of  600 per annum.Public Works outside the Special Areas.5.   Although by Section 1 (6) of the Special Areas Act the Commissioners are enabled to initiate, organise, prosecute and assist measures outside the Special Areas in so far as such measures may afford employment and occupation for [12152] c
substantial numbers of persons from those areas, the Commissioner up to the date of his report had (apart from schemes of Land Settlement in the South of England for families drawn from the Special Areas) not found it possible to exercise his powers under-this Section of the Act. He had, however, made representations to Government Departments with regard to Schemes that afforded opportunity for the employment of men from the Special Areas e.g., the construction of Aerodromes and Aircraft Bases necessitated by the expansion of the Royal Air Eorce, and the further electrification of the London Transport System.Public Works within the Special Areas.6. As to Works of Public Utility undertaken by Local Authorities, the Commissioner decided to assist &quot;only such works as could be definitely shown to have value in facilitating the economic development or social improvement of the Special Areas,&quot; and also to operate through the Local Authorities rather than carr)r out such works directly himself. The schemes assisted by the Commissioner fall into two categories, viz., Amenity Schemes, providing for the improvement of sites in such a manner as to bring increased economic or industrial value to the locality, and Schemes connected with Public Health Services, e.g., sewerage schemes, the provision of new or the extension or alteration of existing hospitals, out-patient departments, maternity and child welfare clinics, and the provision of open-air swimming baths. In his report, the Commissioner gave details of 53 schemes in respect of which he had promised assistance, the total estimated cost of which amounts to  900,750 (i.e., Hospitals  257,000, Sewerage  423,850, Water Schemes  10,300 and Site reclamation, clearance and improve-ment  209,600). The most important of these schemes were the Glamorgan County Hospital, the East Gateshead Clearance Scheme, the South Shields River Bank Development Scheme and the Maryport Coast Protection and Development Scheme.7. In so far as grants to bodies other than Local Authorities to assist under-takings not carried on for the &quot;purpose of gain are concerned the Commissioner had offered to pay for the dredging of Maryport Harbour to a limit of cost of about  4,000.8. The Commissioner made representations to the Secretary of State for War regarding the benefit the Special Areas would derive from the establishment of new Summer Military Training Camps in those areas. One Camp was arranged in the vicinity of Tow Law, County Durham, for a period of one month in August and September, 1935. The cost of preparing the site, laying drains, &amp;c, was to be met from the Special Areas Fund up to a maximum of  1,500. The question of providing additional Camps in the Special Areas in 1936 was being actively pursued.A griculture.9. The Commissioner reported that his schemes for the settlement of unemployed persons on the land fell into three categories : Settlement on Small Holdings large enough to afford an independent livelihood to their occupiers; formation of Group Holdings by which are meant plots up to a quarter or half an acre of land per man cultivated by men working in groups of about 20; and the extension of the movement for cultivating allotments.10. As regards small holdings within the Special Areas, the Commissioner reported that he had made an offer of financial assistance to Local Authorities if they would exercise their powers under the Small Holdings Act, 1926. This had met with little response except from the Durham County Council who had inaugurated two schemes, one at Mount Pleasant, Crook, where 95 acres had been purchased and 19 men were to be employed in pig and poultry keeping, market gardening and glasshouse cultivation, the Commissioner advancing the necessary working capital amounting to  260 per man, half of which was to be repaid by the Small-holder in instalments starting in his third year, and a second at Bishop Auckland, providing for the purchase of 512 acres where men will occupy 56 holdings ranging from about four to eight acres, the Commissioner agreeing to make a grant sufficient to cover one-half the loss falling on the Council
and to meet the cost of working capital, estimated at  14,560, on the same terms as at Mount Pleasant. He was also making arrangements, which were not complete at the date of his report, with the Land Settlement Association to under-take the settlement of a number of families from the Special Areas in groups of about 40 families in Northumberland and Cumberland. In Wales, he reported, it was his intention to constitute a Land Settlement Association to undertake experiments in various forms of settlement on the Land. It was also hoped to secure the co-operation of the County Councils in South Wales in the provision of small holdings under the Small Holdings Act.11. The Commissioner decided to arrange small holdings outside the Special Areas through the Land Settlement Association. The Association at the date of the report was engaged in settling 40 families from Durham on an estate at Potton, Bedfordshire, given by the Commissioner under an arrangement by which one-third of the cost estimated at  750 per family-was to be contributed from the Special Areas Fund; and of the balance one-third to be provided from Voluntary Sources and one-third from the Development Fund, the conditions regarding advances and repayment being the same as in the Mount Pleasant Scheme. Up to date 30 heads of families had actually transferred to Potton. The Association had agreed to undertake five other schemes on this basis and a second estate has been acquired at Andover and the men had been selected and were to be transferred during the summer. The Association had also agreed to undertake a further 20 schemes for the settlement of 40 families each in other parts of England on the basis that the total cost of these schemes should be provided from the Special Areas Fund:12. As to Group Holdings, there were in the Special Areas at the time the Commissioner took office a number of Centres in Durham, the cost of which was being borne entirely by the Society of Friends without any Government Grant. There were also a few similar holdings in Northumberland and Cumberland, and in Wales one poultry centre with five men. The Durham. Council decided to develop the groups themselves. The Commissioner undertook to make a grant to the Council of  11,765 for the purpose of inaugurating new centres, and extending the existing centres, and promised further financial assistance if additional centres could be set going. At the end of June 27 new centres had been started, providing for a total of 532 men, and the 13 existing centres had been extended. In Cumberland and Northumberland the Society of Friends remained responsible .for the centres. Grants had been approved for extending seven existing and starting four new centres. No groups had actually started operations in South Wales, but the administrative machinery had been created, and it was expected that a number of centres would be established shortly.13. The Commissioner addressed a letter to all allotment authorities in the Special A.reas offering to make grants towards the cost of purchasing land for allotments, but met with disappointing response. Several allotment societies in Wales and Monmouth were given grants of money to pay for materials for fencing new allotment land and for the provision of community huts on new allotments. The grants made affected some 1,700 plots.Other measures of Socicd Improvement.14. The Commissioner had given grants to local amenities schemes carried out on a voluntary labour basis, the result of which would be to provide amenities of immediate advantage to those engaged on the work, to their families and neighbours. The schemes covered such work as the levelling of. ground for games; the improving the aspect of waste space by turning it into a garden or recreation ground; the provision of paddling pools and small open-air swimming pools. Grants had been made under certain conditions towards the cost of the necessary tools, materials, working clothes and midday meals; in some cases, the cost of purchasing land, and in others the cost of providing and erecting a hut on the site, which could serve as a shelter for persons occupied on the schemes, and after-wards possibly as a pavilion. Technical advice in the preparation of the plans and the execution of the work had also been provided. Seventeen schemes had been approved in the Durham and Tyneside area, and seven in South Wales. The total sum granted or promised was  6,413, and the number of unemployed [12152] c 2
persons occupied on the schemes was approximately 930. Other schemes, including some from West Cumberland, were under active consideration.15. The Commissioner decided to adopt the policy of centralising his grants for Social Service through the National Council of Social Service, and had allocated over  150,000 for these purposes. The more important grants were for School Camps for boys and girls ( 70,000), for Occupational Centres and holidays for women ( 12,500), for Social Centres for Adolescents ( 30,000), for Lecture Courses, Choral Societies, Drama Groups ( 12,500), and for additional District Nurses ( 17,100).16. In regard to Subsistence Production Schemes, a grant up to  12,000 had been promised to the promoters of the Upholland Scheme for the establish-ment in South Wales of a similar scheme to be called a &quot; Subsistence Production Society,&quot; to provide for 500 families.Transference out of the Areas.17. The Commissioner reported that he was making every effort to encourage the transference of the younger persons to employment outside the Special Areas. He left the executive action with regard to transference from the Special Areas to the Ministry of Labour, but in the case of one local enterprise in County Durham, under the direction of Lady Headlam, which had been in existence for some years with the object of transferring young women and boys from that county to employment mainly domestic in London and the South of England, he had promised financial assistance.Summary of Commitments and Effects.18.   The Commissioner summarised his commitments as follows : Approximate TotalTotal CommitmentEstimated of SpecialCost.

The Commissioner, in paragraph 240 of his Report, stated that, &quot; whilst the Act does not permit the application of fundamental remedies . . . ., the effect of the assistance afforded in many directions, and of the grants made, should be increasingly felt and prove of permanent advantage to the Special Areas.&quot;(ii) Scotland.Industrial Development.20. The Commissioner reported that he was working in close co-operation with the Scottish National Development Council, and grants to the Council had been approved for a scheme of Publicity ( 22,500) and for the purpose of research into the extraction of oil from coal ( 800). The steps taken up to the date of the report with regard to publicity were the organisation of a permanent
exhibition of the products of the Scottish Special Areas at British Industries House, London; the dissemination of information about the Special Area through the Council&apos;s journal &quot; Scotland,&quot; &amp;c.; Scottish stand at the British Industries Fair, Birmingham; and the establishment of an Information Bureau. Schemes for further participation in Trade Exhibitions were in course of preparation. Consideration was being given to the expansion of the general programme of publicity. As to oil, the object of the Commissioners grant was to assist in the appointment of a scientist for the purpose of carrying out practical experiments into the question of the extraction of oil from certain classes of coal.Public Utility and Amenity Schemes.21. With a view to rendering the Areas more suitable for economic develop-ment, improving their health and adding to their amenities, the Commissioner had undertaken to make grants amounting in all to  571,162 in aid of 22 schemes for the purification of sewage, the improvement of water supply, the laying out of parks and recreation grounds and the construction of promenades and river walls. The estimated total cost of these Works is  1,297,594. The Commissioner had in contemplation the assistance of a further 20 schemes of Sewage purifica-tion, water supply, and amenity, estimated to cost  376,455.Land Developments.22. As to the Unemployment Plot Schemes, the Commissioner made a grant of  5,000 to the Joint Committee of the Scottish National Union of Allotment Holders and Society of Friends for the purpose of providing Plot Holders who have successfully cultivated their plots of \ to 1 acre in extent for a period of one year- or more with repayable advances of  10 per man for the further development of their plots.23. A grant of  14,000 had been made to the Joint Committee of the Scottish National Union of Allotment Holders and the Society of Friends for -additional administration and the acquisition of land for the extension of Allotment Schemes in the Special Areas.24. The Commissioner acquired Lampits Farm, Carstairs, from the Ministry of Labour to utilise it for an experiment to demonstrate group production on a subsistence basis known as &quot; Home crofting &quot; under the direction of Professor J. W. Scott, of Cardiff University, the originator of the scheme. The members of the groups will aim at producing as many of their common requirements as possible for their own support and mutual exchange.25. The Commissioner estimated his commitments on these schemes of Land Development at  49,500.Social Service Schemes.26. The Commissioner, in co-operation with the Ministry of Labour, established a number of physical training centres at selected points in the Special Areas. The cost to the Special Areas Fund was  8,500, and between 2,000 and 3,000 men were regularly attending the classes, and the number was increasing. Arrangements were also being made to start classes for Young Women.27. The Commissioner made grants of  15,000 to bombs^s&apos; Organisations and  10,750 to Girls&apos; Organisations for work connected with the welfare of Adolescents in the Special Areas.28. The Commissioner made grants amounting to  36,000 to the Scottish Council for Community Service for the creation in selected districts of a number of Occupational and General Community Service Centres on model lines. The grant was primarily intended to meet the initial difficulties of obtaining satis-factory accommodation and equipment, on a scale which will admit of more permanent development. The Commissioner had purchased and was developing as a large-scale community service centre and residential settlement an estate of 40 acres of land and a mansion known as Carfin Hall, New Stevenston. He estimated the cost to the Special Areas Fund at  6,000.

The cost to the Special Areas Fund was  8,500, and between 2,000 and 3,000 men were regularly attending the classes, and the number was increasing. Arrangements were also being made to start classes for Young Women.27. The Commissioner made grants of  15,000 to Boys&apos; Organisations and  10,750 to Girls&apos; Organisations for work connected with the welfare of Adolescents in the Special Areas.28. The Commissioner made grants amounting to  36,000 to the Scottish Council for Community Service for the creation in selected districts of a number of Occupational and General Community Service Centres on model lines. The grant was primarily intended to meet the initial difficulties of obtaining satis-factory accommodation and equipment, on a scale which will admit of more permanent development. The Commissioner had purchased and was developing as a large-scale community service centre and residential settlement an estate of 40 acres of land and a mansion known as Carfin Hall, New Stevenston. He estimated the cost to the Special Areas Fund at  6,000.
29. The Commissioner made a grant of  1,200 to the Queen&apos;s Institute of District Nursing for the provision of improved nursing services in the Special Areas.30. As to holiday camps, the Commissioner made a grant-in-aid to the Scottish Council of Community Service for the organisation of a camp to provide a holiday for approximately 300 families of unemployed men, and to assist with camps for children and young persons who are outside the scope of the various youth organisations.31. The Commissioner estimated his total commitments under the heading of Social Service at  82,450.Summary of Schemes Approved and in Hand. 32.   The Commissioner summarised his commitments as follows :  Approximate Total- l-otai CommitmentEstimated of Specialcost- Areas Eund.Industrial Development ...        23,300Public Works           ...          ...    ij297;594 5ff Land Development    ...          ...        49.500 S*600Total ... ...    1,452,854 726,42233. The Commissioner, writing of his grants towards Public Utility and&apos; Amenity Schemes, however, stated: &quot;The number of schemes still under consideration is so large that I anticipate a rapidly increasing expenditure, even when due allowance is made for the restrictions I have imposed as to the class of scheme which I can assist.&quot;TL.-Proposals under examination by the Commissioners with a view to action at the date of their first reports (July 4, 1935).34. Reference has been made above to the Commissioners&apos; intention to continue and extend a number of the types of assistance which they were giving. They referred in their reports to certain further schemes which they had under examination at that date.   The following are the more important of these :  (i) England and Wales.Public Works.35. A scheme submitted by the Waste Lands Committee of the Tyneside-Council of Social Service for the clearance of sites adjoining the East Gateshead Clearance Scheme, and also the question of the construction of the deep-water quay which formed part of the original South Shields River Bank Development Scheme, were under consideration. A scheme for the unification of the Tyneside Sewerage system, estimated to cost  3,500,000 (but likely to cost much more) was brought to the Commissioner&apos;s attention, and he offered to bear the cost of a Committee of experts to investigate the question whether the condition of the tidal portion of the river is so injurious or dangerous to public health as to require a comprehensive scheme to ameliorate it.   The Committee is being set up.36. In paragraphs 73-80 of his Report the Commissioner sets out the position as it then was regarding the suggested Pit Drainage Scheme for South Wales. So far as legal powers are concerned, the Mines Department has, under Section 18 of the Ministry Industry Act, 1920, power to enforce such a Scheme in theory. As, however, the Department can be taken to arbitration, it follows that in practice it can only enforce a Scheme if a substantial majority of the coalowners are in favour of it.
37. A report has now been received stating that the Committee of Coalowners who were considering the proposal are not in favour of proceeding with the Scheme, and giving their reasons for this decision. The Commissioner remains in touch with the Mines Department with a view to seeing whether anything further can be done.38. In the case of the Mid-Glamorgan Sewerage Scheme, estimated to cost  350,000, the Local Authorities concerned appointed a consulting engineer, at the request of the Commissioner, to investigate the matter with a view to determining whether the joint scheme, or individual schemes, or a combination of both, would be the best solution of the problem.39. Investigations were in progress regarding the proposed Monmouth-shire-Eastern Valleys Sewerage Scheme.40. The Commissioner offered the Tyne Improvement Commission a grant of one-third of the cost of construction of a Deep Water Quay with a depth of 35 feet at low water on the South Bank of the Tyne in the vicinity of Tyne Dock. The scheme would provide within three miles of the open sea facilities such as do not exist at present on the East Coast for very large ships. The Commission made the L. and N.E. Railway Company an oiler for the purchase of the present Tyne Dock, which the Railway Company did not accept. There was, therefore, a deadlock at the time when the Commissioner reported.41. After an investigation carried out on his behalf by the Harbour Engineer of the Ministry of Transport, the Commissioner made a conditional offer of  100,000 to the Whitehaven Harbour Commissioners for improvements to the harbour. The Harbour Commissioners did not feel able to accept the terms of the offer, and the matter was being re-examined at the date of the report, with a view to ascertaining if a practicable and acceptable scheme could be prepared.Social Services.42. The Commissioner, having reached the conclusion that there is room for improvement in regard to the methods of purchase and preparation of food in working-class homes, was inviting the co-operation and assistance of the National Council of Social Service, and the National Federation of Women&apos;s Institutes, with a view to setting up cookery courses and demonstrations during the forthcoming winter.(ii) Scotland.Industrial Development.43. Investigations had been conducted by the Commissioner into the possibility of initiating a s)rstem of regional gas supply for the West of Scotland. On the recommendation of the Commissioner, a Committee was to be set up for the purpose of examining the data collected and formulating a complete administrative Scheme.Public Works.44. Proposals for dealing with derelict property were under consideration. The Commissioner was also considering the provision of hospitals and other Medical Services in cases where the existing arrangements are inadequate and may be attributed to industrial depression. Amongst other schemes which had been brought to the Commissioner&apos;s notice and which he had expressed his willingness to consider are schemes for an industrial estate, and for the preservation of certain reaches of the Clyde.Land Developments.45. The Commissioner was investigating two schemes of peat reclamation, which are estimated to cost  40,000, with a view to submitting specific proposals. He was also taking steps to acquire land for the purpose of setting up an experimental farm on co-operative lines, for older men unable to take the
responsibility of a Small Holding, at an estimated cost of  50,000. The Commissioner was collaborating with the Department for Agriculture in a scheme for the Settlement on Departmental Small Holdings of five acres or more of selected unemployed men, unable, owing to lack of capital, to qualify under the ordinary Scheme. A special training staff had been provided, with assistance from the Special Areas Fund. The initial arrangements provided for the settle-ment of 70 men with their families, and, if successful, the scheme can be extended without the provision of new machinery. The Commissioner had also under consideration a scheme for the commercial and agricultural development of a large area.Social Service.46. The Commissioner was considering, in consultation with the Department of Health for Scotland and the Scottish Education Department, the establishment of play and health centres for the children of unemployed persons in the Special Areas.III.  Work of Commissioners since date of Reports (July-September, 1935).(i) England and Wales. Industry.47. In regard to the grants to the North Eastern Development Board and the South Wales Development Council (see paragraph 3 above), the programmes of the Surveys have now been agreed. In the case of the North Eastern Development Board  1,000 of the grant has been allocated to the South West Durham Board for a special survey of the Industrial position in that part of the area. It has been arranged with the concurrence of the Mines Department that this Survey shall include an investigation of the possibility of establishing a central pumping scheme for the coal mines in the48. The London Passenger Transport Board has offered the Commissioner the use of the Charing Cross Underground Station for an exhibit relating to the Special Areas. The offer has been accepted, and arrangements for the Exhibition are being made.49. The total number of replies received to date to the Commissioners circular on the possibility of firms establishing themselves in the Special Area is 1,763.   A detailed summary of the results is in course of preparation.Public Works.Public Health, Sec, Schemes.50. In addition to those mentioned in paragraph 6 above, the Commissioner has now given provisional approval to a further 75 schemes, the total estimated cost of which is approximately  345,000. In 22 cases, on the recommendation of the Ministry of Health, it has been agreed that the whole cost of the Scheme will be met from the Special Areas Fund.Maryport Harbour.51. The work of dredging the harbour has been completed satisfactorily, and the cost, which amounted in all to  4,230 2s. Qd., has been paid.Land Drainage.52. The Commissioner for England and Wales refers in his Report (para-graph 119) to a circular addressed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to local authorities in the special areas, offering Government grants of 60 per cent, of the expenditure on schemes promoted by any Catchment Boards set up in those areas. The replies received have been considered by the Ministry, which, as a result, is of the opinion that, in the light of present information, there are good reasons, in spite of opposition from certain county boroughs, for the formation of additional Catchment Areas in South Wales and the Ministry is
proceeding to take the necessary steps under the Land Drainage Act with a view to their constitution. On the other hand, the Ministry considers that there are no prospects of establishing additional Catchment Boards in the Special Areas in the North of England.53. In the circumstances it was suggested that the veto on the making of grants by the Commissioner for land drainage should be withdrawn, and that the Commissioner be authorised to assist drainage works by making grants to any existing local authority which is able to undertake such work, provided that \ the work, at the time the grant is promised by the Commissioner, does not lie within a Catchment Area, actual or in contemplation, and that it does not involve heavy maintenance charges at a later date. This suggestion has been adopted and grants of this kind are now being considered by the Commissioner for England and Wales.Other Schemes.54. Further discussions have taken place with the appropriate authorities with regard to the following schemes, on which, however, no decisions have yet been reached : Sunderland Fish Quay; Sunderland Land Reclamation Scheme; River Tyne Deep Water Quay; Whitehaven Harbour Improvement Scheme; Tyne Sewerage Scheme. The question of further assistance towards the building or extension of hospitals is under consideration in relation to particular proposals.A griculture.A llotments.55. A further circular letter has been issued to Allotment Authorities in the Special Areas renewing the Commissioners offer to make grants towards losses incurred in the provision of additional Allotments. It is hoped that this will meet with a more favourable response than the earlier circular, mentioned in paragraph 13 above, which was necessarily issued at an unfavourable time of the year.Group Holdings.56. The Land Settlement Association have now assumed responsibility for developing Group Holdings in the Special Areas in Cumberland and Northumber-land. In South Wales arrangements have been concluded, with the assistance of the County Authorities, for organising Group holdings in South Wales and Monmouth. Schemes for two group holding centres in Monmouth, and for one such centre in Glamorgan have been approved.Small Holdings.57 (1) England. Arrangements have been concluded with the Land Settle-ment Association, whereby that body will undertake a number of Small-holdings Schemes in the Special Areas in Cumberland and Northumberland, as well as a number of transference Schemes in the Midlands and South of England.For the purpose of the transference Schemes the following properties have been purchased by the Commissioner : Three farms at Lawford, Essex (345 acres); Fen Drayton Estate, Cambridge (350 acres); Howden Estate, Yorkshire (345 acres); Fulney Farm, Spalding, Lines. (122 acres); Good Hall and Home Farms, Ardleigh, Essex (273 acres).58 (2) Wales. Arrangements for the setting up of the Welsh Land Settle-ment Society are still under discussion. Negotiations are in progress for the purchase of two adjacent properties near Cardiff, comprising about 1,250 acres, for the purpose of a Co-operative farming experiment on intensive lines similar to the &apos;&apos; Fordson Scheme &apos;&apos; at Boreham in Essex.Cheap Milk for Nursing and Expectant Mothers and Young Children in the Special A reas.59.   Details of a scheme for providing milk at a reduced price for nursing and expectant mothers and children under five in the Special Areas in England and Wales with assistance from the funds at the disposal of the Special Commis-sioner  have  been  considered  by  Departments  concerned,  and  preliminary [12152] D
discussions have taken place with the Milk Marketing Board for England and Wales.60. The scheme under consideration provides for the sale, through the usual distributive channels, of milk at a substantially reduced price to all eligible women in the Special Areas who register with the Local Public Health Authority. The Local Authority would itself be entitled to take advantage of the scheme in connection with the supply of milk to nursing and expectant mothers and children within the limits of its Maternity and Child Welfare powers. The source and quality of the milk supplied would be approved in the same way as the existing Milk-in-Schools scheme.61. It has been intimated to the Board, with the concurrence of the Special Commissioner, that, if proposals of this nature are acceptable to Ministers in principle, assistance up to  50,000 for an approved experimental scheme to last one year might be forthcoming.62. The Ministry of Health would welcome the provision of milk at special prices, as for school children, to expectant and nursing mothers and children under five years of age in the Special Areas, and they are in consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture and other Departments concerned on the subject.63. The Milk Marketing Board for England and Wales are definitely anxious to co-operate. It will be necessary, however, for the Board to induce distributors in the Special Areas to work on a reduced distributive margin in respect of this milk. The co-operation of Local Authorities in the Special Areas must also be secured. Discussions with the Milk Marketing Board have been opened, and the Board have intimated their willingness, subject to the co-operation of the distributors, to operate a scheme on the basis of the following figures :-Pence per gallon.Average wholesale price of liquid milk       ... 15^Distributor receivesTotal outgoing Consumer pays ...Constructive loss Area Commissioner pays Board suffers loss of Board receives  ...23^ 16HIOther Measures of Social Improvement. Voluntary (Local Amenities) Schemes.64. Ten schemes have been approved in the Durham and Tyneside Area, nine in South Wales, and one in West Cumberland.Social Service.65. Two further grants totalling  1,183 for the work of Social Settlements, and two grants amounting to  650 for the acquisition of land and buildings of a permanent character for use as Occupational Centres for the unemployed have been promised to the National Council of Social Service.Nursery Schools.66. On the question of Government Grants in the Special Areas to voluntary organisations for the provision of nursery schools, the organisation to undertake the cost of maintenance, a proposal has already been made for giving Government grants to an existing voluntary organisation for the provision of Nursery Schools in the Special Areas. The Emergency Open Air Nursery Schools Committee, which has done good work in providing Nursery Schools in poor areas, including Tyneside and South Wales, has applied to the Commissioner for the Special Areas for a grant to enable it to extend its work. The Commissioner, after consultation with the Board of Education, has submitted to the Minister of Labour a proposal
to make grants in aid of the provision of such schools as he may approve on the advice of the Board. The Board would satisfy themselves in each case as to the suitability of the area for a grant-earning Nursery School and as to the arrange-ments to be made for the maintenance of the school, and would themselves be prepared in suitable cases to recognise the school and to pay grant in aid of its maintenance at the rate of 50 per cent, of the approved expenditure. This proposal has been approved.Physical Training Classes.67. Arrangements are in hand for an extension of the schemes at present organised by the National Council of Social Service for Physical Training Classes in the Special Areas.Cookery Classes.68. The Commissioner has approved the proposal to assist the provision of instruction and demonstration courses of simple cookery and food values for housewives in the Special Areas. Arrangements are being made for these courses to start in October under the auspices of the National Council of Social Service, the National Federation of Womeiis Institutes and the Townswomen&apos;s Guilds.Summary of Commitments.69. As a result of further developments since the date of the report the CommissionerV financial Commitments are now as follows :  Approximate TotalTotal &apos; CommitmentsEstimated of SpecialCost.

(say)         750,000 100,0004,087,000        2,339,000(ii) Scotland.70. Since the date of his first Progress Report, Sir Arthur Rose&apos;s work has consisted mainly in the development of the various schemes to which reference was made in that Report.   It may be summarised as follows :  Economic and Industrial Development.71. Further progress has been made with the schemes of intensive propaganda on behalf of the Special Areas which are being carried out with the assistance of the Commissioner by the Scottish National Development Council. The special Scottish Section at British Industries Plouse, London, has been developed. Arrangements for the Shipbuilding and Engineering Exhibition which is to be opened at Olympia in September are nearing completion; and space has been reserved for a Special Areas Exhibition at the British Industries Fair which is to be held at Olympia in February of next year.   In addition, a third[12152] &apos; d 2
supplement to the Scottish National Development Council&apos;s Journal (&quot; Scotland &quot;) dealing with the power facilities of the Special Areas is in course of preparation.72. The Commissioner has increased to  1,040 the grant which he is making to the Scottish National Development Council in aid of a scheme of research into the coal and oil resources of the Special Areas.73. The arrangements for the setting up by the Board of Trade of a Committee to investigate the possibility of initiating a system of regional gas supply for the West of Scotland have been successfully continued, and it is hoped that the Committee will be constituted at an early date.74. The Commissioner has also been considering, in consultation with the County Council of Lanark, the possibility of a Municipal Aerodrome being erected near Glasgow and a meeting of the Local Authorities interested has been arranged.75. Further progress has been made with the schemes designed to make the Special Areas more suitable for economic development, to improve their health and to add to their amenities. Since the date of the Report, assistance to ten additional schemes of sewage purification, one scheme for water supply and one scheme for the provision of Municipal baths has been promised or approved. As a result, the total expenditure on schemes for the purification of sewage, the improvement of water supply, the laying out of parks and recreation grounds and the provision of baths now amounts to  1,485,303, towards which the Commissioner proposes to make grants amounting in all to  647,841. Further schemes of this nature are still under consideration, and, as pointed out in his Report, the Commissioner is also actively considering the giving of assistance towards the provision of Hospitals.76. Considerable progress has been made with the schemes referred to in the Report. The land at Lampits on which the Home Crofting Experiment, is to be carried out, has been acquired, and arrangements, under the direction of Professor Scott, are well advanced.77. Approval has been given to the carrying out of two experimental schemes for the reclamation of peat land in Lanarkshire, estimated, with the accompanying agricultural developments, to cost approximately  40,000.78. The scheme for a large scale experiment in land reclamation and area development is still under active consideration, and considerable progress has been made.79. No new schemes have been inaugurated since the date of the Report, but good progress has been made with the development of the schemes already referred to. The arrangements for the provision of physical training centres have proved particularly successful, and the Commissioner proposes to develop and expand this work as much as possible.80. As a result of further developments since the date of the Report, the estimated total cost and the estimated cost to the Special Areas Fund of the schemes which are in operation or approved should now be Land Developments.Social Service Schemes.Total Cost  Cost to Fund.

Part B. Suggestions of the Commissioners.I. Suggestions which, under existing Policy or Departmental Authority, couldbe Accepted in Whole or in Part.Industry.Revision of the Block Grant Formula.81. The formula for the distribution of the Block Grant is due for revision before March 1937, and measures are already being taken for this purpose. In the revision endeavours will no doubt be made for securing a larger share for areas in exceptional need, but the formula has to provide for Local Authorities throughout the country, and it seems improbable that any practicable changes will meet the exceptional circumstances of the Special Areas. One important factor in this connection is that population must be the basic factor of distribu-tion, and Special Areas will come off badly on population because of migration from the areas without corresponding reduction in cost of services. This fact will have to be considered in deciding on the new formula.Trading Estates.82. The Commissioner for England and Wales has now put forward a proposal that he shall acquire sites in the Special Areas, and develop them as trading estates on the lines of those at Slough and Trafford Park, Manchester, clearing, levelling, providing roads and quays and other essential services, and erecting factories which should be available for letting on short leases to persons about to start fresh enterprises. It is proposed that a special organisation should be set up for the purpose, and that there should be a Government representative associated with the organisation. No evidence is adduced that development in the Special Areas is impeded by the lack of facilities such as it is proposed should be supplied, but the Commissioner states that he is advised that industrial development on Tyneside is definitely hindered by the lack of empty sites in decent order with adequate facilities readily available.83. There is no doubt that the presence of such facilities does attract industry : among the reasons given in the Survey of Industrial Development, 1934, for the location of new factories, &quot; convenience of premises &quot; (though the Report deprecates the attaching of any great importance to this somewhat vague phrase) was the chief consideration in 55 per cent, of the cases in which these reasons were ascertained. It is therefore probable that the adoption of the Commissioners proposals would offer a definite inducement to new industries to settle in the Special Areas, though doubt has been expressed whether this inducement would be sufficient to overcome the objections on other grounds which might be present in the minds of industrialists.84. As to the means of providing such facilities, the Commissioner states that there is no prospect whatever of such an estate being set up by private enterprise in the Special Areas. Such information as is available in the Board of Trade confirms this opinion. So far as is known, the only existing trading estate company which would be in the least likely to consider an extension of this kind is Slough Estates Limited, which has developed a large estate at Slough with considerable success and has more recently opened a similar estate in Birmingham which is progressing slowly. The possibility of opening up a trading estate in one of the depressed areas was discussed by Sir Horace Wilson with the heads of this Company in 1931, but nothing came of it. From a recent conversation with the Managing Director of the Company, it is gathered that the Company are not contemplating a venture in any of the Special Areas; the Managing Director stated that in his opinion such a venture would not be a paying proposition as the site would be too far from the principal markets for the products of the lighter industries such as are normally attracted to a site of this kind : he also expressed the view that difficulties might be expected with regard to the supply of labour.
85. With regard to other possibilities mentioned by the Commissioner, the Board of Trade see no reason to question the Commissioners conclusion that neither the establishment of a company under Government guarantee nor organisation through a local development council is immediately practicable.86. The Board of Trade agree with the Commissioner that the operation &quot;is unlikely to prove economic.&quot; It is, moreover, as he says, an &quot;enterprise which should normally be financed by private capital.&quot; Nevertheless, the Board are impressed by the necessity for an experiment in inducing industry to settle in the Special Areas, and would consider this particular proposal open to much less serious objection than the use of Government money in direct assistance to competitive productive enterprise.Coal Policy.87. In paragraphs 182 to 190 of his Report, the Commissioner for England and Wales boldly faces the fact that the reorganisation of the mining industry to the fullest extent which would give economic advantage means an increase and not a decrease in unemployment. He favours the concentration of the industry, the increase of mechanisation, and the closing of pits in spite of the increased unemployment which would ensue. The decision on principle involved in reorganisation on these lines is dealt with in a Cabinet Memorandum (CM.I. (35) 2), which, it is understood, will shortly come before the Cabinet.88. The Mines Department feels obliged to offer the following comments on statements made by the Commissioner with regard to the quota system. This system has, in practice, resulted in considerable reductions of costs. Indeed, the financial advantages (and consequent social disadvantages) of concentration have, to some extent, been secured by concentration within individual mines instead of by concentration on some mines and the closing of others.89. The Commissioner states that the Coal Mines Act, 1930, has failed in its efforts to control prices. As a general statement this goes beyond the facts, though there have been evasions. While the Act has not resulted in increase in price, it has undoubtedly prevented the reductions in price which occurred in other basic commodities. If the maintenance of prices of basic commodities during the depression was, as is now generally agreed, a laudable object, Part I of the Coal Mines Act, 1930, must be considered a success.90. The Commissioner recommends reorganisation of the sales machinery and reconsideration of the quota scheme. With the principle of reorganisation of selling, the Department is in entire agreement and the Government has shown its support of this policy by securing the approval of both Houses of Parliament to the Lancashire Selling Scheme. But it would not be wise to move too rapidly. It is not unreasonable to expect that other districts will wish to wait a few months to see the effect of the Lancashire Scheme on that District before attempting-similar schemes.91. Reconsideration of the Quota Scheme is another matter. The Lancashire Selling Scheme would not have been possible but for the existence of the Quota Scheme, and it is thought that it would not be possible to introduce Selling Schemes in other districts of the country if the Quota Scheme were abolished. After such Schemes have been established, other means of keeping output in relation to demand may emerge, in which case the Quota Scheme will become of less importance; but its cancellation at the present time would be resisted by the great majority of the coalowners and by the workmen, and would lead to such severe price competition as would throw the industry into chaotic condition and ultimately seriously reduce wages.92. The proposal of the Commissioner that the miners in some areas should be informed that they had no likelihood of further employment in the neighbour-hood of their homes is drastic, but neither State-aided nor voluntary transference will take place on any substantial scale until that fact is realised by the men concerned. The difficulty would be to decide which areas should be selected for this drastic treatment. Once a mine is abandoned the position is apparent to all, but so long as the owners of the mine are prepared to spend money to keep it in a condition to reopen (and it is to these mines the Commissioner is referring).
it is obvious they themselves have hopes of reopening, which hope is, quite naturally, shared by the men. It would be an invidious task for the Government to select certain mines from among these, and say to the Owners that they are spending their money fruitlessly, and to the men that the mine will never reopen.93. In paragraph 190 of his report the Commissioner for England and Wales advocates the State ownership of coal mining royalties. This matter is also included in the Cabinet Memorandum referred to in paragraph 87 above, and the Committee is, therefore, not in a position to make any comment on the proposal.ICentral Bureau of Information.94. The Commissioner for England and Wales says in paragraph 194 of his Report that the Government might with advantage assist industrialists in coming to a decision with regard to the location of industry if it were to set up a Central Bureau of information, to which they could refer for advice and technical data relating to potential industrial districts, not only in the special areas, but elsewhere. In the same paragraph he says that it is futile to attempt to establish industries in the special areas when the economic factors do not warrant their doing so. It would only afford temporary relief, bearing the seeds of further future distress which is avoidable. He concludes, however, that the influence of the bureau would tend to establish a better balanced distribution of industrial activity.95. It is not clear what kind of information the Commissioner expects the Central Bureau to be able to give to applicants. If he has in mind that the Bureau should select a district that is most suitable to a particular type of manufacture, he is imposing on it a formidable task. The selection of a site for a factory involves consideration of a number of general factors, such as the proximity of markets and facilities for transport, but, in addition, a number of technical considerations peculiar to each industry must be taken into account. The water supply (both in quantity and in character), proximity of suitable sources of raw material, the type of skilled labour available, and other factors, may well be of such importance in particular cases as to make the difference between success and failure to the undertaking. If the Central Bureau were to attempt to give reasonable advice as to the location of the site, it would be necessary for it to give exhaustive consideration to the matter with technical assistance. The type of technical assistance necessary would vary with the type of manufacture, and the Bureau would be extremely expensive. It would not appear likely, however, that the intending factory owner would be satisfied with any other judgment on such a matter than his own, and it may be suspected that most of the labour of the Bureau would be wasted.96. It may be, however, that the proposal is that the Bureau should be merely in a position to inform an applicant of such information regarding a particular district as the possibility of obtaining factory sites there, the cost of electricity or gas, the level of local rates and the transport services. In that event, it is doubtful if the Central Bureau could add anything to the many local services that are already anxious to provide such information. The Railway Companies maintain services of this kind for the districts served by their lines. Most Local Authorities are ready to answer questions of this kind and can give better local information than a Central Bureau could hope to possess. The Ministry of Labour possesses a good deal of information about the supply and quality of labour, rates of wages, &amp;c. This information is available, or can be collected from the Employment Exchanges, for centralised use, but much of it is subject to variation according to fluctuations in the local employment situation and will require regular revision. In practice, the Central Bureau would hardly acquire a sufficiently detailed knowledge of the composition and quality of local labour supplies, and of the specialised labour requirements of the different industries, to avoid the necessity of referring enquirers to the locality for exact information.97. Many areas are now served by Development Councils, which have made the supply of information useful to intending purchasers of factory sites one of their more important functions.   The Employment Exchanges and Divisional
Total        ... .:. ...      5,368,000In addition, contracts to the value of about  4f millions were placed on the Clyde outside the Special Areas.The figures for the current year will be substantially larger.103. On the specific suggestion of the Commissioner, attention could be drawn to the foregoing figures and to the condition attached to the guarantee given by the Government in connection with railway electrification in LondonOffices of the Ministry of Labour are frequently in contact with these Councils and supply local information on labour matters to them, or, at their request, to applicants who have approached them. These Councils are affiliated to the Travel and Industrial Development Association. In general, the Association refers an applicant to the appropriate Development Council for local information. If, however, it is thought desirable that the information collected by the Develop-ment Councils and other agencies should be centralised, the Travel and Industrial Development Association would seem a suitable body for the purpose. It already receives a State grant, but some addition would no doubt be necessary if it were asked to undertake further work of this kind. It might also be desirable to obtain the agreement of the Development Councils to any step which might be resented as a suggestion that they had not in the past carried&apos;out this part of their duties efficiently.98. The Travel and Industrial Development Association might feel some diffidence in offering to undertake this work, as it is already regarded with some degree of suspicion or jealousy by some of the local Councils. This might be overcome if it were found possible, concurrently with any increase in the grant to the Travel and Industrial Development Association, to give some extra financial assistance to the Councils for this part of their work.A advertising A broad.99. In paragraph 6 (7) of his report the Commissioner for England and Wales records that the legal opinion that his powers do not extend to measures outside the United Kingdom has prevented him from assisting Development Councils to advertise abroad. It is understood that the Scottish National Development Council have also proposed to utilise for advertising abroad part of the grant made to the Council by the Scottish Commissioner. A grant for purposes of this kind is already made, on the vote for the Department of Overseas Trade, to the Travel and Development Association and this could be increased with the.object of advertising the Special Areas.100. There are obvious objections, however, to competitive advertising abroad and the Association might find difficulty in meeting the conflicting claims of the various areas, and for this reason the Commissioner is understood to have favoured the making of grants to the various Development Councils. That course, however, would seem to lead to the worst forms of competitive advertising. A better course seems to be to increase the grant to the Association, on the recommendation of the Commissioners, with a direction to pay special attention, to the Special Areas.Government Orders.101. In paragraph 209 of his Report the Commissioner for England and Wales suggests that, wherever possible with due regard to price and quality, the Government should place its contracts with firms in the Special Areas. This is at present the policy, so far as the &quot; scheduled depressed areas &quot; are concerned; this, of course, covers a wider area than the Special Areas. Paragraphs 262-267 below deal with more specific suggestions of this kind and paragraphs 104-107 with the question of a price preference on Government contracts.102. The value of the Government contracts placed in the Special Areas during the financial year 1934-35 by the Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry,, Post Office and Office of Works was :   England and Wales... ... ...      5,031,000Scotland   ... ... ... ... 337,000
that, other things being equal, contracts should be placed, in the special Areas. Though there has been some criticism of this condition, it could be stated that a similar condition will be attached if similar circumstances should arise. Such a statement seems abundantly justifiable.Price Preference on Government Contracts.104. In paragraph 209 of his report the Commissioner for England and Wales suggests that the Government should, wherever possible, with due regard to price and guality, place its contracts with firms in the Special Areas.105. The present practice is that all the Contracting Departments give a preference, other things, being equal, to firms situated in the &quot; scheduled depressed areas &quot; (a larger field than the Special Areas).106. The Contracting Departments and the Treasury would be strongly opposed to a price preference, and the Cabinet Committee on the Special Areas, when considering the Reports of the Investigators in 1934, definitely decided against a price preference. In practice the preference, &quot; other things being equal,&quot; does not, in fact, often give much advantage to firms in the depressed areas.107. The Contracts Co-ordinating Committee at a meeting on the 9th July satisfied the Commissioner that they keep constantly in mind the needs of the depressed areas, and that short of a price preference, which he did not himself advocate, or of the establishment of Government factories, which also he did not support, they are doing all they can to help. When it becomes necessary to look for new sources of supply, e.g., in order to broaden the basis of supply or to deal with a price ring, the Departments do their best to find firms in the Areas (see paragraphs 101-3 above).Public Works.Rural Housing.108. In paragraph 157 of his report the Commissioner states that there are areas in the middle and south of England where, though employment may be available, housing may be an impediment to the absorption of individuals and families from the Special Areas. The experience of the Ministry of Labour goes to show that there is some justification for this view. It has been suggested that one step towards meeting the difficulty would be the establishment of a Public Utility Society, financed by the Commissioner, to provide houses in rural areas in the middle and south of England where employment is available very likely for both a man and his wife or where the Ministry of Labour considers that, even though no actual vacancies exist, there is a good prospect of employ-ment or of a living being made in such occupations as rural handyman. A preliminary scheme has now been put forward by the Commissioner and is under examination and discussion departmentally.Arterial Drainage (Scotland).109. On page 18 the Scottish Commissioner states that his attention has been drawn to certain important schemes of arterial drainage and that he made representations to the Scottish Department of Agriculture regarding them. Now that the Land Drainage (Scotland) Act, 1931, has been extended, plans for putting selected schemes in hand are being worked out by the Department.Military Camps.110. In paragraph 82 the Commissioner for England and Wales suggests that the establishment of Summer Military Training Camps would assist the Special Areas in several ways. He states that he assisted in connection with one such camp this year, and that the question of providing additional camps next year is being actively pursued.North-East Area: Public Utility Housing Society.111.   The question how far the Commissioner for the Special Areas should be enabled to deal with housing matters was considered when the Special Areas Bill was before Parliament, and it was decided by the Government not to exclude [12152] E
housing from the general provision which precluded the Commissioner from contributing towards the cost of any works for which a specific Exchequer grant is payable.112. As Exchequer subsidies are payable in respect of houses built by local authorities under the Slum Clearance Act of 1930 and to be built under the new Overcrowding Act, this decision meant that the Commissioner could not assist the authorities in respect of houses built by them either to replace the slums or to enable overcrowding to be abated. On the other hand, it was clear that overcrowding was more acute in the North-East than in any other part of the country, and as it is a condition of the payment of subsidy under both Acts that a contribution must be made from the rates in respect of each house built by a local authority, it was felt that many of the local authorities, in view of their straitened financial position, would find it difficult to comply with the provisions of the Overcrowding Act, even if they were able to complete their slum clearance programmes.113. The Commissioner accordingly suggested &apos; that he should take advantage of the provision in both Acts whereby a Public Utility Society, building houses in co-operation with a local authority to re-house people displaced by the local authority&apos;s action in clearing the slums or abating over-crowding, is enabled to receive, via the local authority, the Exchequer subsidies payable to the local authority, who are not, in these circumstances, required to make any contribution from the rates.114. The Commissioners proposal was to stimulate the formation of such a Society, to whom he would make lump-sum grants up to the capitalised value of the contributions from the rates which the local authorities would have made had they themselves built the houses, and so enable the Society to let the houses at rents as low as those which would have been charged by the local authority had they carried out the scheme direct. It has been represented that it will be impossible to find competent persons to man such a Society, that the local authorities would not be prepared to allow houses (which in the better-off areas are being built by the local authorities themselves) to be built in their areas by such an organisation, and that the Society would be bound to take a very long time to get to work.115. Obviously the second and third of these difficulties can only be finally answered after the first has been solved, as the extent of the co-operation by local authorities would depend largely on the confidence which the personnel of the Society is able to inspire.116. As regards the first difficulty, three well-known public men (Mr. Austin Kirkup, Mr. Angus Watson and Sir Arthur Lambert) have been invited in turn to become the Chairman of the Society, but all have found themselves unable to accept, mainly, it is understood, on the ground of the calls which would be made on their time. Steps are now being taken to approach other men of public standing in the area.117. As regards the second difficulty, some municipalities may conceivably carry their political views to the extent of refusing to have houses built in their area without cost to themselves and for the benefit of their population, but obstinacy of this kind is barely conceivable and cannot frequently occur unless the local authorities can see a chance of compelling the Government to adopt the alternative of amending the Housing Acts by providing for the payment to authorities in the Special Areas of an Exchequer subsidy equivalent to both the present Exchequer subsidy and the rates contribution. The Ministry of Health have promised to do what they can to assist, and they have arranged for an Assistant Secretary of the Ministry to hold two informal conferences in the area with a few selected local authorities. When the results of those conferences are known, an opinion can be better expressed as to the probable attitude of the authorities.118. As regards the third difficulty, any scheme must involve building operations over a considerable period if the unsatisfactory housing conditions in the North-East are to be effectively remedied.
119. It should be added that the possibility of the Commissioner making grants to local authorities in respect of unsubsidised building was also explored, but, in view of the provisions in the Bill then before Parliament for the pooling of subsidies and consolidation of housing accounts, it was considered doubtful whether it would be possible to maintain any such distinction between subsidised and unsubsidised building as would leave it open to the Commissioner to take such a course. In any event, the main need was felt to be the building of houses to re-house people living in unfit and overcrowded houses, for which purpose the Act of 1930 and the new legislation contain subsidy provisions.Agriculture.Small Holdings.120. The Commissioner for England and Wales contemplates the establish-ment of 2,000 families from the special areas on small holdings during the two years ending July 1937. Of this number, 1,440 would be established by the Land Settlement Association acting on the Commissioners behalf, and the remaining 560 mainly by the Welsh Land Settlement Society, but partly also by direct arrangements between the Commissioner and the Durham County Council. The Commissioner, the Land Settlement Association and the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries are of opinion that 2,000 is a sufficiently large number of holdings to form the basis of what is admittedly an experiment in the settlement of unemployed persons and their families on the land. The programme entrusted to the Land Settlement Association should prove to be within the Association^ capacity. On the other hand, any substantial increase in the scale of operations would go beyond the limit of what the Association can be expected to carry out efficiently. The programme which the Commissioner has arranged for is, therefore, regarded as adequate in present circumstances, and it is suggested that the Commissioner should be supported in his general attitude towards land settlement as outlined in his Report.Afforestation.121. The Commissioner for England and Wales refers to the belief that large schemes of afforestation are possible in and near the Special Areas; he suggests that in South Wales there are 300,000 acres prima facie suitable for afforestation.122. These possibilities are certainly exaggerated; the Forestry Commission have surveyed practically the whole of South Wales; the land suitable for their purpose amounts to about 120,000 acres and it is open to the objections that the air is smoky; the water content of the soil often inadequate; that the tracts immediately adjoining the valleys would be expensive in warding and fire protection and there are extensive common rights which it would be slow and expensive to extinguish.123. It must be remembered that the Forestry Commission are bound to work to a long-term programme and that they cannot develop&quot; rapidly or by spasms. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has recently agreed to an increase in their annual grant for the next five years which, with some readjustment of their finance, will enable them to expand their planting programme up to about 30,000 acres a year. They are prepared, in order to help the Special Areas, to concentrate their efforts immediately upon the country in and adjoining them, and they hope by the end of October to be able to say definitely what properties they can or would like to acquire near them; this will apply particularly to South Wales, Cumberland and the LTaltwhistle and Kielder areas. It must be recognised that very little of the land will be within travelling distance of the men living in the Special Areas. In some places compulsory purchase will be necessary if progress is to be made.124. If additional Exchequer money were made available, the Forestry Commission could provide additional forest holdings up to, say, 150 a year in England and Wales, the majority of which could.be reserved for families from the Special Areas. The capital cost would be about  500 per holding : in addition, there would be the cost of removal expenses, and either grants or loans for the development of the holdings, or, possibly, continued allowances from the [12152] &quot; &quot; e 2
Unemployment Assistance Board during a probationary period. In some cases, assistance would also be required from the Board towards the purchase of household equipment.125. A similar scheme was started in 1929 but met with little success. Fewer holdings than had been anticipated (about 80 in all) were made available for ex-miners; complaints regarding the wages paid and the accommodation and land provided were common and a number of the men gave up their holdings. In spite of the expenditure of a great deal of time and trouble only 64 ex-miners are at present in occupation of forest holdings out of 105 who at any time have been assisted under the Scheme.126. This form of land settlement is the cheapest and it may be worth while trying it again, especially perhaps in South Wales, where the holders will not be too far away from familiar surroundings. But experience suggests that the scheme will only be successful if the holders (and their wives) are selected with greatest care and all possible assistance and encouragement extended to them in their new surroundings.127. It has been suggested that over and above the normal work of the Forestry Commission, or in addition to work such as has been discussed in the preceding paragraphs, it would be desirable for the Government to acquire large areas of land (50,000 to 100,000 acres, or possibly more) in the Welsh Hills and another similar area in the Northumbrian Hills and develop these areas as large scale experiments in the use of land. The programme would include provision for settling men in small agricultural holdings and in forest holdings, but the land would be chiefly devoted to afforestation while suitable areas would be developed as national parks. It is recognised that difficulty might be experienced in acquiring on reasonable terms such large areas of land within a comparatively short period of time. If, however, the proposal commended itself to the Govern-ment, the first step would presumably be to set up a special Committee on which the Commissioner for the Special Areas, the Forestry Commission and the Ministry of Agriculture were represented in order to prepare a detailed scheme with estimates of the cost and of the number of men for whom employment might be found..  Transference. Necessity for Progressive Policy.128. In paragraph 160 of his report, the Commissioner for England and Wales expresses the view that transference must be regarded as one of the essential measures of relief, fie states that he has left executive action in regard to transfer to the Ministry of Labour, and, in paragraph 171, advocates the holding out of every inducement to those willing to transfer and likely to establish themselves in other areas.129. The steps taken by the Ministry of Labour to promote the transference of adults fall into three categories. In the first place, there are measures designed to increase the number of vacancies in other areas available for workpeople from the depressed areas, e.g., vacancies which cannot be filled locally are generally circulated in the depressed areas before they are thrown open to the whole country; employers in districts where the local employment position permits are approached with a view to reserving some vacancies for depressed area men; and Government contractors are asked to engage their labour through the Exchanges and so to give them the opportunity of arranging transfers when suitable workpeople are not available locally, while similar arrangements are made, so far as practicable, in connection with Local Authorities&apos; contracts. Secondly, assistance is given towards removals, e.g., fares are paid to enable workpeople to travel to take up employment or, in certain circumstances, for interview by a prospective employer; fares are advanced for them to travel to areas where there are prospects of obtaining work; those who&apos; have obtained work are granted allowances while they are looking for accommodation, and, afterwards, the cost of the removal of their families and household goods to the new area; where a shortage of suitable work-people in any occupation is likely, arrangements are made for selected workpeople to travel to the area concerned and to await a vacancy, arid special allowances are paid by the Unemployment Assistance Board or the Ministry of Labour to
assist such men while awaiting a job; assistance is now given in cases where a younger member of a family has obtained employment in an area offering prospects of employment for other members of the family. The number of men and women transferred in 1934 was 11,248. In 1935, up to the end of August, the number was 12,627, of whom 9,662 came from the Special Areas. (Tor juveniles see paragraph 130 below.) Thirdly, there are the arrangements designed to increase the qualifications for employment of men from the depressed areas. There were about 3,000 training places during the year 1934, and some 5,000 men completed training or were placed in employment during the course. Over 900 additional training places were provided during the year, mainly by setting up a new Centre at Slough. Since the beginning of the current year the number of training places has been increased by a further 200, and further increases are contemplated which will bring the total number of places available to about 4,750. Some 16,000 men were admitted to Instructional Centres during 1934, for whom it is less easy to find openings, but every effort is made to find employment for them wherever there is a demand for unskilled labour which cannot be met locally. Special canvassing efforts have been made in the current j^ear with a view to bringing the training facilities to the notice of every eligible man on the registers. The response has been variable, according to localitjr, but more men could still be taken in the Instructional Centres. As regards Government Training Centres, it is unwise to train more men than can readily be placed in the employment market. The Ministry&apos;s present policy is to train as many as can be placed.130. As to juveniles, the facilities of the juvenile transference scheme have recently been greatly extended. The extensions include the payment of weekly maintenance grants out of voted monies in addition to wages, so that a juvenile has a reasonable sum for his personal use after paying his living expenses. Great care is taken to ensure that the employment is satisfactory as to wages and working conditions, and that the welfare of the juvenile is properly supervised. Grants in aid are paid in respect of training schemes for juveniles, conducted by voluntary bodies, for farm work and various kinds of domestic service. The prospect of enlarging these is now under consideration, Transference could be considerably extended if parents showed greater willingness to- allow their sons and daughters to leave home. The shortage of girls willing to transfer is acute, and a shortage of boys is beginning to show itself. To overcome this difficulty systematic publicity is required. New posters and leaflets have been issued, but they are not enough to bring home to parents the advantages of transfer to a developing industrial area. Persistent and varied propaganda will be necessary if the flow of juveniles is to be sufficient to meet the requirements of developing areas. It is proposed to produce a film to be shown in the depressed areas. The number of juveniles, i.e., persons under the age of 18, transferred in 1934 was 5,173. In 1935, up to the end of August, the number was 5,749. It is not possible to state how many of the latter came from the Special Areas, but the great majority did so.131. The fact is that facilities for training, reconditioning or transference are available for all suitable persons in the Special Areas. It is true that there is some reluctance to make the fullest possible use of these facilities, but, in these circumstances it seems that, so far as vacancies in private employment are con-cerned, adequate measures are being taken to carry out the policy which the Commissioner advocates. The question of increasing transference by means of preferential grants is dealt with in paragraphs 197-211 below.Migration.132. In paragraph 220 of his report, the Commissioner for England and Wales expresses the hope that the earliest opportunity will be taken to re-open with the Dominions negotiations for resumption of Empire migration.133. The subject of migration to the Dominions has been under consideration by an Inter-Departmental Committee on Migration Policy under the Chairman-ship of the Chairman of the Overseas Settlement Committee. The Report, which was published in August 1934, has been referred to the Dominion and State Governments concerned for their consideration, as well as to the voluntary societies and others in the United Kingdom who are interested in migration. Such replies as have yet been received from Dominion and State Governments are of a
non-committal character. As regards the immediate prospects for a resumption of migration on a considerable scale, reference may be made to paragraphs. 30 to 38 of the Report. It is probable that steps will be taken in the comparatively near future to set up the Board recommended by the Inter-Departmental Committee in paragraph 177 of their Report. A decision on the general questions of policy involved cannot be reached by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom on the basis of considerations applying only to the Special Areas and in advance of the result of consultation with the interests concerned.134. The Commissioner does not do more, however, than express the hope that negotiations for the resumption of Empire migration will be re-opened with the Dominions at the earliest favourable opportunity; and the first step in this direction has been taken by reference of the Committee&apos;s Report to them.Hostels.135. In paragraph 6 (8), the Commissioner for England and Wales states that he regards the provision of hostels to accommodate persons transferred from the Special Areas to other districts as a most important part of any transference policy and regrets his inability, for legal reasons, to contribute to the cost involved. On page 24, the Scottish Commissioner states that he has examined the possibility of assisting in the provision of hostels for youths transferred to London and elsewhere, and regrets that legal doubts have prevented him from taking practical measures.136. The Ministry of Labour has statutory powers to provide hostels or to make grants to voluntary organisations for the purpose, and is ready to consider extensions. The present position is that arrangements have been made for the Y.M.C.A. to run on behalf of the Ministry of Labour five experimental hostels for juveniles, four in London and one in Redditch. This seems to be a matter in which existing powers can be used to meet the Commissioners&apos; desires, but the matter is referred to again in paragraph 333 below dealing with the powers of the Commissioners.II. Suggestions which seem open to Considerable Objection or on whichDifficulties Arise.Industry.Finance for New Undertakings.137. The Commissioner for England and Wales suggests in paragraph 32 of his report that he may find it necessary to advise the establishment of a special fund to finance new undertakings in the depressed areas. The Commissioner says that it is doubtful whether any organisation on a commercial basis can meet the needs of the areas; he proposes to take further steps to ascertain the extent of the demand (he has in mind public advertisement, and special reference in industrial surveys to be undertaken); and if he finds that there is a real opening for new enterprise if the necessary capital were provided, he might find it necessary to advise the creation of a special fund.138. The Scottish Commissioner similarly puts forward tentatively for consideration the possibility of Government guarantees for &quot; financing men in a small way who have what appears on the face of it to be a sound idea or invention.&quot; More definitely than the Commissioner for England and Wales he seems to have in mind the inventor.139. Since the date of his report the Commissioner for England and Wales has recommended that he should be authorised to give substantial grants either out of the Special Areas Fund or from some other source to Local Development Councils in the Special Areas and to other bodies constituted with similar aims .and objects, such grants to be used for stimulating new industries or for the expansion of existing industries by loans at a low rate of interest. The Com-missioner suggests that the Councils should operate through a special Committee on which financial interests and the District Commissioner should be represented, that they should obtain his sanction before making a loan to any company, and that the Council should be represented on the management of the Company during the period of the loan.
140. It is understood that the Scottish Commissioner would also be in favour of a scheme of this sort with the modification that he would make the loans directly.141. Suggestions of this sort, though without detail, have also been made by the Bishop of llandaff&apos;s Committee and the deputation of Northern Members received by the Prime Minister.142. Proposals of this kind are not new. The Government expressly decided when the Special Areas Act was to be introduced that the Commissioners should not be empowered to give financial assistance to undertakings operating for profit (see Official Report, the 3rd December, 1934, col. 1254). The Commissioner himself describes this limitation of his powers (in paragraph 6 of his Report) as &quot; clearly desirable.&quot;143. The reasons for the decision are well known. It is often stated that any sound venture can at present obtain finance through existing channels. Credit for Industry Limited (to which the Commissioner refers) was established primarily to find credit for the smaller undertakings which could not be financed either by bank advances or by a public issue. There is another organisation called &quot;The Charterhouse Industrial Development Company&quot; with similar objects, and only a few weeks ago Schroder&apos;s announced the formation of the Leadenhall Securities Corporation, Limited, for the same purpose. Moreover, money is so cheap that there is every inducement to capital to look for investments offering possibilities of appreciation and of larger return.144. There are obvious objections to the proposal. The main objection is that it means the provision of Governmental assistance to a man with a new undertaking or process in South Wales, but not to a man with the same under-taking on the Great West Road, or in Lancashire; and not to the man already established, wherever he may be, with whom that new undertaking is to compete. A. boot factory in South Wales, if sufficiently subsidised, might put out of business an equivalent unit in Northampton, and an equivalent number of workmen out of employment.145. The Commissioner contemplates &quot; risks which Credit for Industry cannot legitimately take.&quot; Once he has made enquiries or has published his Report, he will receive a number of applications. It will be difficult to reject them all. The result would be the provision of specially cheap money for those particular undertakings which no-one considers sound.146. Incidentally, only 7 out of 1,763 firms which have replied to the Commissioners circular were found to be prepared to consider new works branches in the Special Areas (see paragraph 28 of his Report).147. As to the Scottish Commissioner^ reference to inventors, if such a man is a man with no capital and no existing business, he complains that he cannot obtain capital to develop his idea and retain control of the development. This has, of course, been the complaint of the inventor, real or self-imagined, for generations past. The fact is that such a man, if he is regarded as &quot; credit-worthy &apos;&apos; can obtain assistance in various ways, but not on his own terms. No organisation least of all, perhaps, a Government organisation can investigate and assess the potential value of inventions in every field of human activity.148. The Commissioner for England and Wales has now recommended that he should have power to make grants to Local Development Councils for stimulating new industries or for the expansion of existing industries in the Special Areas by loans at a low rate of interest. The considerations advanced above apply to this particular suggestion, but it will be necessary to make some statement on the subject. There is still sufficient controversy oii the subject to make it worth consideration whether any attempt should be made to persuade the Banks and other financial institutions to examine again the possibility of setting up a special financial organization.Body to Explore Industrial Conditions.149. The Commissioner for England and Wales makes no suggestion on this subject, though he points out that he has given grants both in South Wales ;and the North-East for new surveys of the areas to be made.  The Scottish
Commissioner, however, suggests on page 12 of his Report, &quot;in a purely tentative manner,&quot; a body financed by the Government to explore industrial conditions, make recommendations, and &quot; in general, aim at introducing into our economic structure that element of orderly and planned development which in the past has in some considerable measure been overlooked.&quot;150. The suggestion that the Government should &quot; plan &quot; industrial development, whether directly or through a new organisation set up for the purpose, is not new. It is the mainspring of the P.E.P. movement; it appears in Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s proposals, and has been supported even by some industrialists. The general reply is contained in paragraphs 63, 64 and 65 of the Governments reply to Mr. Lloyd George, and summarised in paragraph 74.151. While the suggestion in its present form is open to the objections there set out, the Scottish Office consider that special measures are needed for the exploration of industrial conditions in Scotland, and that it may be possible to undertake such measures without involving the foregoing objections.Financial Position of Local Authorities.152. The Commissioner for England and Wales deals with the question of local rates and assistance from the Government in paragraphs 35 to 38 of his report. His specific suggestion about the revision of the Block Grant has been discussed above in paragraph 81 of this report. In general, the Commissioner expresses the opinion that the reluctance to start new industries in the Special Areas is due to other factors than the prevalence of high rates, but that, apart from the effect on industry, high rates are a serious burden which there is little reason to hope will be reduced in the near future without an extraordinary effort on the part of the local authorities or additional help from the Government. He makes no proposal on the subject other than that mentioned. Almost all others who have made suggestions regarding the treatment of the Special Areas deal with the subject of Local Authority finance in one way or another, the Bishop of LlandafPs Committee going so far as to say that the case for debt-cancellation has never been stronger than in South Wales at the present time.153. The inter-Departmental Committee devoted some time to a preliminary examination of these questions, but it was evident at the outset that the matter is of first importance, going far beyond the Special Areas. The Committee came to the conclusion that they were not properly constituted to deal adequately with the matter and that their Report is not a suitable medium for its treatment. They think that, if the subject is to be examined with the care it demands, the best course would be to refer it as a separate matter to the Departments concerned-Treasury, Ministry of Health, Scottish Office and the Unemployment Assistance Board.Public Works.Restriction of Grants to Works of Economic Value.154. On account of the risk of the Special Areas Fund being used to finance mere relief schemes and the risk of ending all prospects of the improvement of local amenities by voluntary labour, the Commissioner has assisted only such works as could be definitely shown to have value in facilitating the economic development or social improvement of the Areas. This is an administrative practice and not a requirement of the Act.155. The decision has led to a good deal of criticism, especially in Durham and particularly with regard to the clearing of slag-heaps and other unsightly relics of a past industrial age. The Commissioner has found it almost impossible to certify that most of the schemes of this kind which were put to him would have any economic value and, therefore, very little has been done in this direction.156.   The question is one of the biggest issues in the North East, but the following considerations have to be taken into account : 157. If once it were agreed that slag-heaps could be cleared with wage-paid labour, it would be comparatively easy to spend millions of pounds and put many men to work, but the resulting economic value would be problematical.   It may
be held that derelict buildings and slag-heaps have a deterrent effect and impress prospective employers unfavourably. This, however, is probably a very minor factor in deterring new industry from the Special Areas. The more important factors are those mentioned in paragraph 29 of the Commissioner^ report. In most cases there would be no result of any lasting value to show for the money other than the removal of the slag-heap, or derelict building. If the same amount of money is to be spent &quot; to put men to work &quot; it would be far better to use it on other schemes of which the real value or need may be problematical, but is certainly far higher than that of schemes for clearing away slag-heaps.158. The Commissioner has already been able to approve one or two amenity schemes on a wage-paid basis, where such schemes lie near the entrance to an industrial area and where their improvement may be said to have some economic value. A typical case is the Rabbit Banks scheme on the banks of the Tyne at Gateshead. Possibly a somewhat more liberal view might be taken of the type of scheme which has potential economic value of this nature, but it is not recommended that there should be any general departure from the principles laid down by the Government and accepted by the Commissioner, because the removal of the present limitations would render it exceedingly difficult to know where to draw the line, and would mean not only a virtual reversion to the policy of relief works, but to the execution of schemes which on any list of possible public works would normally be given an extremely low order of priority.159. The District Commissioner for Durham and Tyneside reports that voluntary (local amenity) schemes are gaining in favour in the area. If the present policy of assisting these schemes without any publicity is pursued, he thinks it may be possible before long to undertake the clearance or improvement of ugly &quot; eyesores &quot; by voluntary labour in a number of districts. The scope of the schemes carried out by voluntary labour must be to some extent a limited one, but this possibility makes it all the more undesirable to undertake this work by wage-paid labour. It is, however, essential to success in this direction that the initiative should come from the unemployed, and any publicity would be fatal. It is, therefore, of vital importance that the reason mentioned in this paragraph should not be quoted in public.Commissioners&apos; Powers to assist Public Works in the Special Areas.160. The Commissioner, with the consent of the Minister of Labour, is empowered to make grants to local authorities for certain works for which specific grants are not payable. Appendix VIII of his report contains a long list of schemes to which he has provisionally approved assistance, covering sewerage, clearance of sites, local improvement works, hospitals, and so on. The total cost of the schemes provisionally approved is about  1^ million. The Commissioners position in relation to land drainage schemes carried out by local authorities (schemes which he has not hitherto aided) is discussed in paragraphs 52-53 above.161. The Commissioner is precluded (except in the case of small holdings) from supplementing specific grants made to Local Authorities by Government Departments. This broadly debars him from giving supplementary assistance for road and bridge schemes on classified roads, municipal housing, school buildings, &amp;c.162. He is also debarred from assisting Local Authority works which Government departments are empowered to assist by specific grants, but towards which they do not, in fact, offer or agree to make such grants.163. His inability to assist the schemes mentioned in the preceding para-graph turns on a legal decision which has been questioned. The opinion of the Law Officers on this point is being sought, but, meanwhile, it may be remarked that, whatever that opinion may be, the question whether assistance should be given by the Commissioner remains a matter of policy as, under another provision of the Act, the Commissioner can make recommendations for the removal of difficulties, and under this provision Government Departments, if they so desired and if the Commissioner so recommended, can meet the difficulty which the legal opinion, which at present holds the field, is alleged to have created.
164. The power of making recommendations can also be made effective as regards most of the services where Government grants are actually paid. The problem of the cases which the Commissioner cannot directly aid therefore presents itself, not as one of lawbut as one of the administrative policy to be adopted as regards special assistance to certain types of municipal public works in the special areas, viz. : (1) Cases normally aided where the rate of grant, fixed under a policy adopted for the country as a whole, may not be thought to be adequatein the case of special areas. (2) Cases where aid could be given, but where, under the same policy, thescheme in question is of a type not thought to merit national assistance.165. Certain cases can be ruled out at once. In the case of school buildings, for example, the major part of the ultimate cost of a school lies, not in the loan charges incurred for its original provision, but in the expenditure necessary to provide the education given in it. In the case of municipal housing, subsidies are statutory, and if extra assistance is to be given in the special areas, there are advantages in giving it through a public utility society, such as the Commissioner is at present establishing, rather than through local authorities. Legislation would, in any event, be needed before the Commissioner could assist municipal housing, whatever opinion the Law Officers give on the question referred to them.166. In practice, cases in the first category above are broadly road and bridge schemes on classified roads and those in the second category are equally broadly road schemes on minor roads and grants for local authorities&apos; harbours, docks or piers.167. Undoubtedly a good deal of useful work could be executed if special assistance were given in the Special Areas, but there are serious questions of policy to be considered in this connection.168. First, when the Commissioner was established, it was not contemplated that he should to any large extent assist ordinary public works carried out for wages. As the Commissioner himself recognises, such works have to be judged primarily by their value as works of development or improvement, but even where their value from. this angle is admitted any large stimulation involves serious disadvantages. In particular, the provision of work in the areas discourages transference, an important argument to which the Commissioner is alive and which he has endeavoured to meet by special recruitment conditions, but it might be difficult in practice to attach to the special rate of grant conditions different from those attaching to the normal rate.169. Second, as regards road grants for trunk roads and for schemes involving dual carriageways, special rates of grant have recently been sanctioned for poor highway authorities. It is likely that, with this special assistance, a good deal of work will be done in the Special Areas as part of the Five-Year Programmes. An extension of this gradation might be difficult to restrict to Special Areas.170. Thirdly, increased State grants, once started, are difficult to stop and any increase in the field increases the danger that the position may be reached under which local authorities in the Special Areas retain their administrative responsibilities, but transfer their financial responsibilities to the State.171. These arguments, primarily directed to cases of supplementation of grants, do not all apply to cases where no grant is at present paid. In particular, there is no flexibility of existing grants on which to rely, and there would be less difficulty in insisting on suitable labour conditions.172. If it is decided that, notwithstanding these dangers, there must be some extension of assistance to public works in the special areas, it is suggested that it. should be confined to cases where no Government grant is in practice payable at present and that the Commissioner should make recommendations to the Departments concerned, in order to establish the position which would have existed had he been able to make grants himself. Safeguards will be essential and it is suggested that anything akin to ordinary maintenance should be
rigorously excluded, while such capital schemes as are included should be of as non-recurrent a type as possible. The schemes which might be admitted are the making of roads not of classification value in connection with site clearances, &amp;o, the making up of roads to an adequate standard where they are likely to lead to economic development on the criteria applied to works already aided and the construction in special cases of municipal harbours, docks, or piers.173. This suggestion can be adopted without legislation. It involves, however, the use of the Road Fund for grants to minor roads, as without legisla-lation such grants cannot properly be charged to votes of Parliament. It involves also the taking of a Vote should it be decided to assist any harbour, dock or pier schemes.174. So far as the making up of private roads is concerned the Commis-sioners already have adequate power to make grants.Public Works Available in the Special Areas.lib. While a detailed survey would be necessary to be sure of the position, the indications are that there are not public works of sanitation and public health requiring to be done in the Special Areas of England and Wales of very large aggregate value, unless works are to be provided above what would be likely to be carried out by the Local Authorities even if rate levels were normal. A great deal has been done in recent years with the aid of unemployment grants and with the 100 per cent, grants out of the  500,000 provided in the year 1930-31 for works in selected areas.176. The Commissioner has Treasury authority to pay the whole capital cost of certain &apos;&apos; amenity &apos;&apos; schemes, and has promised to help two such schemes at Gateshead costing  26,920. He has also authority, to pay 100 per cent, grant towards &apos;&apos; public health &apos;&apos; schemes in six particularly hard-hit areas (Abertillery, Blaenavon, Brymnawr, J arrow, Merthyr Tydfil and Nantyglo and Blaina); and has already approved schemes, costing  15,674, in these areas and further schemes, costing  145,329, are now being considered. The Commissioner has also approved provisionally the payment of a 100 per cent, grant towards a further section, costing  59,865, of the main sewer in Rhondda which was referred to in Lord Portal&apos;s Report.177. The payment of 100 per cent, grants might be extended if it should be desired still further to encourage public works in the Special Areas. The scheme might be operated on the same general lines as that of 1930-31 a statement to be made that 100 per cent, grants will be made up to a specified limit (which could later be increased if thought advisable; Authorities are more likely to be prompt with proposals if a limit is fixed); a preliminary careful selection of places and applications to be restricted to them (not all places in Special Areas need 100 per cent, grants); and close scrutiny of proposals and supervision by a specially competent engineer (the latter is important, and the Ministry of Health saved a good deal of money by its adoption in 1930-31).178. An important consideration in this respect is the charge which will be thrown on local rates for maintenance, after works have been carried out. Unless there are strong reasons to the contrary, it is obviously desirable to choose works with relatively low costs of maintenance and also works that will give employment to relatively unskilled men.179. The difficulties about carrying out large schemes of replanning are, apart from the additional hindrance to transfer of labour to other areas, that many of the areas have little or no future and no amount of replanning is likely materially to attract new industries, and that replanning on any large scale would not be practicable without a great deal of demolition and reconstruction; further, that it would be little likely to be serviceable unless made to a definite objective. The clearance of derelict areas in order to improve amenities is, however, not open to the same objections (see, however, paragraphs 154-159 above).180. Schemes of works by Local Authorities would also probably be increased, though not to a large extent, if the Commissioner were permitted in
other ways to extend the scope of his assistance to services not now eligible for his grants. Schemes now assisted are either those which are necessary on urgent grounds of public health or amenity schemes of such a nature as are likely to encourage economic development (such as site development schemes and sewerage schemes in advance of development). The provision of playing fields and recreation grounds by Local Authorities might be encouraged where necessary, and the provision could not reasonably be expected to be made by voluntary labour. Assistance might also be permitted on an extended scale towards revenue-producing schemes with value for industrial development or social improvement, if it could be shown that otherwise there would be a deficiency on the rates.181. There is evidence that much needs to be done to put into good condition private streets, including &quot; back streets.&quot; There are a large number of such streets in the mining towns and villages of South Wales and the North of England. Some of these streets have been laid out by colliery and other companies near to their respective works, others by builders and contractors prior to the period of trade depression, and, whether the buildings remain in the original ownership or have been acquired by the occupiers or by other persons of limited means, the streets have not been made up or taken over. The legal liability for making up such streets is on the frontagers. The local authorities have power to contribute to the cost, but will usually only take over the streets and the liability for their future maintenance if the frontagers meet the cost (or at least a substantial part of the cost) of making them up to proper standards. Only a very small proportion of these streets are of any potential value for through traffic, and there is no justification for spending Road Fund money on roads the making up of which can be justified only on the grounds of amenity and local convenience.182. The Commissioner has adequate power to make grants through the local authority in such cases, and might well be authorised to render financial assistance on the basis that the owners should be required to contribute where they can.183. Any such action by the Commissioner may, it is true, provoke questions as to that class of local public road which falls between private streets (for the making up of which the Commissioner might make grants) and the roads of through traffic importance (to which the Road Fund would contribute). Reference has frequently been made to the case of an industrial site, cleared and ready for development, but served only by a public road which to-day neither carries, nor is capable of carrying, heavy traffic. It seems better that such roads should be considered on their merits, and not taken as a reason for abandoning a policy of assisting the making up of private streets through the Special Areas Fund. The difficulty of the class of public road which is of potential local importance, but not of value to through traffic, might be met by the system of &apos;&apos; recommendation&apos;&apos; by the Commissioner which has been referred to in paragraph 172 above.Other Large Public Works of Possible Benefit to the Special Areas.184. Early in the present year the Minister of Transport invited highway authorities to prepare programmes of work to be undertaken on roads and bridges within the next five years, so that authorities might arrange their programme for some years ahead with the knowledge that grants would be forthcoming. Many of the proposals are submitted in skeleton form only, giving an estimated total of the cost of the several proposed works and the authorities order of priority. In the great majority of cases, naturally, detailed plans and estimates have not yet been prepared and the figures given are provisional lump sum estimates only.185. As has been explained to successive Cabinet Committees, the experience of the last 15 years indicates only too clearly that the inclusion by a highway authority of any item in a programme of works suggested for immediate construc-tion affords no assurance that an early start can be made with the work. Delay is inevitably caused by difficulties which arise in the preparation and execution of the detailed plans, agreements with other interested parties, and the acquisition
of land. This past experience must be borne in mind in considering the following approximate statement of figures of the programmes so far submitted from the Special Areas under the &quot; Five-Year Programme &quot; :  n186. It has been recently intimated to highway authorities that for special classes of work and in special cases, the Minister will be prepared to make grants above the normal percentage level, which is 60 per cent, for Class I and 50 per cent, for other roads.187. The proposals of the highway authority in Durham are submitted subject to the proviso that the work can only be undertaken if grants are markedly in excess even of the special rates of those already offered, and, in fact, Durham County is asking that the whole cost of the programme should be found from the Road Fund, with no local contribution at all. The approval of the programme for Glamorgan and Monmouth would require the concurrence of the Minister of Health, in view of the financial position of those authorities.188. For determining the special rates of grant (in excess of the normal 60 per cent, or 50 per cent.) to which reference has already been made, it may be explained that highway authorities are divided into three groups according to their comparative wealth, calculated on the basis of the relationship at which their &apos;&apos; weighted population &apos;&apos; bears to their actual population, and grants are available at 75, 80 and 85 per cent., and 60, 66f and 75 per cent., according to the class of work involved and the group into which the highway authority falls.189. Reference may be made to a number of large schemes of improvement works, mainly outside the special areas, of high potential employment value, which have been repeatedly considered by the Central Government and the local authorities for more than a decade.190. Thames Tunnel. Estimated cost (including approach roads) of the order of  4,000,000 to  5,000,000. This work is of high traffic priority, apart from great employment value, and reports have been received from consulting engineers; but certain major engineering problems involved are still being-explored and may be found to present formidable obstacles to the execution of the project.191. Humber Bridge. Estimated cost of the order of  1,750,000. New proposals, designed to meet the opposition of the navigation authority, but at a substantially enhanced cost, are under examination, and the Minister of Transport has made a grant towards the cost of a further report by consulting engineers.192. Severn Bridge. Estimated cost of the order of  1,500,000 to  2,500,000. The Minister of Transport made a grant towards the cost of a survey undertaken by consulting engineers, whose report (estimating the cost at some  2,500,000) was received by the Gloucester County Council in August, 1935. Meanwhile, a non-official body has obtained a report from another firm of consulting engineers (estimating the cost at some  1,500,000) which has been widely published in the Press. Copies are understood to have been furnished to all the local authorities concerned, and it should be possible to draw up a definite scheme for consideration at an early date.193. Tyne Crossings. There is at present no road crossing of the Tyne downstream (East) of Newcastle, towards Tynemouth-South Shields. Proposals for a bridge ( 2,500,000) or tunnel ( 1,500,000) have recently been revived, but there is considerable diversity of opinion locally as to which (if either) project should be adopted. The crossing would be of no high value from the point of view of through traffic and is not regarded as having high economic value from the more general point of view.194. Forth Bridge. Estimated costs of the order of  3,000,000 to  4,250,000, according to site to be selected. Further reports by consulting engineers (in respect of whose surveys the Minister of Transport has made grants) are expected shortly, but questions of the first importance, other than those of engineering, are involved.(a) Durham and Northumberland(b) Glamorgan and Monmouth(c) Cumberland(d) Lanark5,880,000 2,050,000 880,000 845,000
195. Tay Bridge. Estimated cost of the order of  2,000,000. This scheme, which must largely be contingent upon the decision as to the Forth Bridge, has not yet reached the stage of definite proposals.196. Reclamation of the Wash. The question of the reclamation of the Wash in relation to the task of the Commissioner for the Special Areas lias been considered by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in conjunction with the Commissioner, in the light, inter alia, of the effect of recent arterial drainage operations. It is undoubtedly the case that works now being carried out on the estuary of the Great Ouse by the River Great Ouse Catchment Board will hasten in that vicinity the process, continually going on round the shores of the Wash, of land becoming &quot; ripe&apos;&apos; for reclamation, and the same is true of work on the estuary of the Wellan also being carried out at the present time. It is not clear, however, how the results of such operations can otherwise be said to have greatly increased the economic attractiveness of the idea of a reclamation of the Wash. If a comprehensive scheme for the complete reclamation of the Wash is envisaged, it can be said that this is not practicable the usual citation of the Zmder Zee works as an example is quite misconceived, the conditions being so dissimilar. Even if schemes on a comparatively small scale for the reclamation of littoral tracts are meant, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries is of opinion that reclamation of land is not at present an economic proposition, especially if carried out by other than mechanical means. In other words, the economic disadvantages are greatest when the employment value is highest. There are a number of areas round the Wash which are now ripe for reclamation, but they are scattered and are mainly of limited depth, factors which strengthen the economic case against any attempt at reclamation.Transference.Preferential Terms to Employ Special Area Men.197. In paragraphs 50 to 53 of his report, the Commissioner refers to measures outside the Special Areas and regrets his inability in the case of certain road and bridge schemes to offer assistance to which, if he had been able to give it, he would have attached the condition that a large proportion of the labour and materials would have come from the Special Areas.198. It may be remarked at the outset that the Commissioner^ inability to contribute to the schemes he mentions is not due to the interpretation placed on the word &quot; payable.&quot; The Severn Bridge project has not advanced to the point at which questions of grant have arisen. On the other two (Pnrfleet tunnel and the London orbital road) grants will not merely be &quot; payable,&quot; but will actually be &quot; paid &quot; in ordinary course as and when the works proceed.199. The Commissioners remarks do, however, raise for consideration the question whether additional grants should be offered to schemes outside the Special Areas on the condition that a substantial proportion of the labour is drawn from those areas.200. Such a policy is not, of course, new. At the time when grants were available for a wide range of public works, grants in the more prosperous areas were for a time allowed only where special labour conditions were attached. As heavy unemployment became more widespread, the formal condition was replaced by an appeal for co-operation in the emplojunent of depressed area labour.201. At the present time, there is no general scheme of assistance to public works undertaken by local authorities. The institution of such a scheme for the more prosperous authorities for the purpose of aiding transference might well, in practice, be only the first step towards the general revival of grants to local authorities for public works for which, with local credit at its present high level, there is clearly no general case. One particular difficulty which would arise at the outset would be as regards those areas which have so many local unemployed that they cannot be expected to take transferences, but which would regard them-selves as more deserving of grants than the prosperous areas.202. The problem only presents itself in current circumstances in practical form as one affecting roads and bridges and land drainage for which there is
already in existence a recognised scheme of grants, and (in this case, not necessarily in the form of additional grant) any particular new scheme which may in future be granted Government assistance, such, for example, as the London Passenger Transport scheme recently approved. It may also arise in large works similar to the seAverage scheme, now reaching completion in Middlesex. (Housing grants are, in general, fixed in amount by Statute and for this and other reasons need not be considered.)203. In the case of road grants, there were originally offered, in the case of the Five Year Programme, uniform rates of grant for all highway authorities varying only with the classification of the road to be built or improved. There has recently been superimposed on this a gradation of grant in the case of trunk roads and schemes involving dual carriageways in relation to the general wealth or poverty of the highway authority, the poorest authorities receiving as much as 85 per cent, for trunk roads and 75 per cent, for dual carriageways (normal rate, 60 per cent.). The introduction into this grant scheme of new differentials, fixed this time not in relation to poverty but to wealth, would reduce the value of the concession recently made to the poorer areas and might lead them to press for increased grants. Indeed, as regards schemes to which the special additional rates do not apply, the position would be created that highway authorities in prosperous areas would be in receipt of higher grants than those in the poor areas a position which could not fail to give rise to ceaseless complaints from the latter. In the light of past experience of Unemployment Grants it is doubtful whether restriction of additional grant for the purpose contemplated could be long maintained.204. As regards land drainage, the grant system is even more flexible than in the case of roads. Each scheme is considered on its merits in the light of all the circumstances of the catchment area. Here also special rates to prosperous areas would obscure the preferential treatment which under present policy the poorer areas receive.205. In each case, the introduction of a new element into the settlement of grant and the upsetting of arrangements which command the general approval of the authorities concerned, is likely to cause delay in the negotiations on schemes submitted for approval and to hamper progress considerably.206. Two more general considerations should be added. First, on both roads and land drainage the question whether there should be additional grant or not for transferred labour does not mean that it is a question whether transferred labour should or should not be employed. It is already the practice to include in the case of road grants an exhortation and in the case of land drainage grants a requirement that additional labour required should be engaged as far as possible through the Employment Exchange and the Exchange at present introduces such transferees as it can. It is a question of the quantum of trans-ference. Second, Employment Exchanges introduce transferred labour as far as possible in meeting the ordinary requirements of industry. Special Govern-ment grants in respect of a prescribed proportion of transference may perhaps create the impression that acceptance of transferred labour involves disabilities for which compensation can justly be claimed. If such an impression were created, the increase of transference to Government works would be offset by a reduction of transference to ordinary industry. And it will be appreciated that transference to ordinary industry is the more valuable as transference to Govern-ment work is only temporary except so far as it is a stepping stone to transference to ordinary industry. Even therefore if the difficulties as regards the effect of the proposal on road and land drainage works were overcome, it would still be a question whether in the long run the interests of transference are not best served by keeping it free from special financial inducements to the accepting employer.207. The Ministry of Labour recognise the force of the objections to paying additional grants to Local Authorities for the purpose of securing transference. They feel, however, that public works provide by far the greatest scope for the introduction of unskilled labour in any quantity into areas of expanding employ-ment. The need for transferring unskilled surplus labour in greater volume from the Special Areas is so imperative that, in the Ministry&apos;s view and despite the objections to which reference has been made, the reintroduction of preferential grants may be necessary if no other means can be found to achieve this end.
208. Under the existing administration of State grants the Employment Exchanges lose no opportunity of introducing labour from the Special Areas whenever the Local Authorities and their contractors are agreeable to this course and it can be done without detriment to local interests. There is, however, no obligation on these contractors to engage labour through the Employment Exchanges. As matters now stand, there is an exhortation on the part of the grant-making Authority, and perhaps a moral obligation on those Authorities receiving grants, to engage a proportion of labour from the depressed areas where local conditions permit and, to this end, to notify vacancies to the Exchanges. But, in the experience of the Ministry of Labour, this does not result in as large a volume of transference as the needs of the Special Areas dictate or as is justified by improving prospects in other parts of the country.209. If an inducement in the form of an additional grant were available to Local Authorities which could, in the opinion of the Department, without serious or more than temporary prejudice to the local unemployment^ed, engage labour from the Special Areas, the better conditions in the South of England and else-where should make it possible to provide opportunities of employment and resettle-ment for appreciable numbers of unskilled men drawn either direct from the Special Areas or through the Instructional Centres. Short of an inducement of this kind, the only way the Ministry of Labour can suggest to provide for the more speedy transfer of unskilled men in appreciable numbers, would be to&apos; make it a condition of the receipt of Exchequer or national grants (other than the &quot; block grant&quot;) that the necessary labour should be obtained through the Employ -ment Exchanges. This would automatically afford opportunities of bringing about in many areas a volume of transference of unskilled labour adjusted to the absorptive capacity of the local labour market.210. While there would still continue to be a number of men who would fail to make good and return home, the resultant increased pace and volume of migration would, it is thought, be noticeable. It would be a corollary of this policy that the Government Departments in their own contracts should set the example by stipulating that their contractors should obtain their labour through the Exchanges.211. In justification of this alternative of imposing an obligation upon Local Authorities and their contractors in the place of offering them a financial inducement to employ transferees, the following considerations must not be ignored : It is anomalous that the Government, with this means open to them of promoting a substantial and indispensable exodus of unskilled men from the Special Areas, should admit a doubt, twenty-five years after the establishment of a national system of Employment Exchanges, as to their efficacy to select suitable unskilled, or even, skilled, men to execute the works in question without additional cost to the employers. It is recognised that some Local Authorities and their contractors still display a reluctance to leave the selection of labour to the Exchanges. Over a long period it has been the task of the Exchanges to demonstrate by their daily routine that fears of this kind are groundless. The rising totals of placings effected show that employers, in increasing numbers and in most industries, have overcome their suspicions and are satisfied with the way in which the Exchanges select labour. The Ministry of Labour feel that no support should be given to Local Authorities or contractors who still entertain misgivings on this score. Nor need doubt be felt as to the ability of the system to gauge the amount of labour from other districts that can safely be introduced for the performance of particular public works. At the same time, it has to be recognised that a condition of the kind proposed, would probably be strongly resisted by Local Authorities, who would claim that the present grants are made as part of the arrangements between central and local finance and that the introduction of a new and extraneous condition of this kind is unwarranted. To seek to impose a fresh requirement upon Local Authorities, except in return for a higher rate of grant, is, of course, a new departure. Not only the Government but Local Authorities must realise, however, that, as regards unskilled labour, some slight prejudice to the local unemployment position is inevitable as part of the price that may have to be paid to solve the unemployment problem of the Special Areas. There is already an unreasonable, and perhaps irremovable, political prejudice against the principle of transference;   it is thought that
despite it, and without increasing it, a great deal more effective transfer of unskilled labour can be done by the means suggested, without harm to the body politic.Resident Commissioners.212. The Commissioner for England and Wales says in paragraph 241 of his Report that &quot; resident district Commissioners are essential to watch over the interests of the areas on behalf of the Government, to further local co-operation,, and to secure co-ordination in all fields of activity.&quot; He does not suggest to whom the resident Commissioner should be responsible when his period of office expires. At present there is a district Commissioner in each of the Special Areas, and there is no reason why the Commissioner should not continue the system so-long as the Act remains in force. The question whether district Commissioners should be appointed for the purposes mentioned after the expiry of the Act is a large one involving many considerations. The attitude of existing local authorities and organisations towards the establishment of something like a &quot; super-authority &quot; would have to be ascertained and taken into account; the condition of the present Special Areas at the expiry of the Act would be a factor of the first importance in reaching a decision; and it might be that new Special Areas will have been added before that time, so that the number of such district Commissioners might be more than four. Thus it seems that a decision cannot be reached now. It is, in any case, unnecessary. It is suggested, therefore, that this recommendation can be left for consideration later as one of the questions which will have to be decided in connection with the expiry of the Act.III. Suggestions which seem open to serious objection.[Note.-Many of these suggestions have been put forward in the course of previous examinations of the unemployment problem, and a number of them have been considered by the Government of the day to be impracticable.]Industry.Location of, Industry (Licensing System and Special Taxation).213. The Commissioner for England and Wales suggests in paragraph 196 of his report the restriction of new factories in specified industries (especially industries enjoying preferential tariffs) by a requirement to obtain a licence. The issuing authority for the licence &quot; would have to be satisfied as to the nature of the arrangements made for the engagement of labour. It would see that preference was given to those from closed works, and arrange, where local conditions permitted, for the transfer of a suitable percentage of unemployed from the Special Areas. It would be impossible to lay down hard and fast lines as conditions would vary in each case. Full discretion should be left to the authority to make such arrangements as are deemed suitable to the particular case under consideration.&quot;214. Under present conditions it is the regular practice of the Employment Exchange Managers to watch developments which may result in the establish-ment of new factories in their district, and to approach the firms concerned with a view to giving assistance in the supply of the labour required. Where local conditions permit, opportunities may be found for the transfer of workers from the Special Areas, or from works which have been closed. So far as the closed works are situated in the Special Areas, assistance for the removal, with their families, of workers who could be absorbed in the new works may be provided under the Industrial Transference Scheme. The proposed licensing system would place on a compulsory basis what is now left to voluntary arrangement.215. Employers do not easily desert their workpeople who are trained and habituated to their employment, and the examples of Stewarts and Lloyds, Imperial Chemical Industries, and Guest Keen-Baldwin&apos;s indicate that oppor-tunities are afforded for the transfer of suitable workpeople displaced from abandoned works.
216. The Commissioner recognises that his proposal would furnish no guarantee as to continuity of employment, but he says that &quot; it would secure some degree of official control where now there is none.&quot; It would obviously be useless to compel an employer to engage particular men when he started a new factory if he was to be at liberty to discharge the men within a few weeks. The fact that he had been forced to employ them might well result in a keener perception on his part of their shortcomings, and discharges of men under such conditions might become common unless some condition were imposed to prevent it. On the other hand, it would be clearly impossible to lay on the employer an obligation to continue to employ the men in all circumstances. It is to be feared, therefore, that the issuing authority would inevitably become deeply involved in the conduct of each new works that was established. It would be required, in the first place, to determine whether the particular men were reasonably suitable for the particular occupation. It might well be involved in disputes as to the proper rate of wages payable, and it would be fortunate if it escaped from acting as a referee in disputes as to whether the men were subsequently efficient or should be discharged. And if the factory were finally unsuccessful, it would probably be alleged that the blame lay with the issuing authority for insisting on the engagement of unsuitable labour.217. Nor would it appear that the proposal promises, at the best, to make any real contribution to the problem of transference of labour from district to district. The &quot; Survey of Industrial Development&quot; for 1934 shows that some 478 new factories (each employing more than 25 people) were opened in that year. Of this number 78 consisted of transfer of a works to a new site. Many types of manufacture are involved, the most important single item being clothing, which is not one of the most promising occupations for men from the Special Areas. The total employment given by the new factories (including transfers from other areas) was 37,200, giving an average of 77 people for each factory. Only 28 of the factories give employment to more than 200 people.218. It may be convenient to refer here to the suggestion, though it was not specifically made by the Commissioner, that the system should be applied in the case of a removal of a works from one area to another. Similar difficulties would arise in that case and there seems no likelihood of useful results being obtained by way of reducing unemployment in the Special Areas; the depression in those areas has not in general been caused by a removal of works, but by the general decline of the industries carried on in them. The &quot; Survey of Industrial Development 1934 &quot; gives particulars (paragraph 11) of factories closed on transfer to another area. No factories were closed in such circumstances in 1934 in Wales, only one was closed in North-East England and two in the whole of Scotland.219. Another aspect of this matter may conveniently be dealt with here, though it was not mentioned by the Commissioner. The possibility has been mentioned of levying on industries moving from a Special Area to a new district a special rate or tax in order to meet the cost of public services which have to be provided in consequence. It is doubtful whether any measure of this kind would make any contribution of moment towards assisting the Special Areas. It would be open to many objections. It would be a reversal, though in special circum-stances, of the policy of derating. The general principle of rating is that rates have to be paid for each piece of property according to its value, subject to any exceptions laid down by statute for specified classes. Any new business pays its share like the old. It has the advantages of services already provided just like its predecessors, and in turn will have to contribute in due course to services still to be provided. While there might be some local expenses which could be allocated as the cost of public services necessitated by the new industry, this would be mostly impracticable except where an industry enters a district hitherto without any, or with few, industries, though no doubt an estimate could be made if the scheme were adopted. If the principle were applied where an industry has moved from a Special Area, pressure would arise for its application to other areas which could show that they would suffer seriously by the removal of some industry; indeed, it would be difficult to see where its application might end, and any large extension would introduce a new chaos into local rating. Moreover, if A, from a Special Area, were to pay to a Local Authority more for public services than
B, from a prosperous area, the Local Authority and not the Special Area would directly benefit. There are cases where a Local Authority has required a contribution for providing a factory with some service expressly required for it, such as sewerage and sewage disposal, but these-cases have been matters of specific agreement. Similarly, a factory may require a large supply of water and the charge on the factory would normally be a matter of agreement with the water undertakers. Where the establishment of a factory is proposed in an already developed area, especially if the factory is large, Local Authorities are usually only too ready to promise facilities to attract it. Sometimes, for instance; Local Authorities have offered sites at less than market value. The attitude of the Ministry of Health has been against such differential treatment. Urgently desirable, therefore, though it may be to retain industries in the Special Areas, it seems doubtful, whether the levying of a special rate would be an expedient or indeed a feasible means of assistance.220. The main issue in this matter are the economic consequences of seriously restricting the movement of industry and that is dealt with elsewhere.Shorter Hours.221. The Commissioner for England and Wales in paragraphs 234 to 238 of his report suggests a reduction of hours of work to, say, 42 or 40 a week with the maintenance of earnings, the employer to bear one half of the cost and the Government to offer to bear the other over a period of, say, three years on a sliding scale to disappear at the end of the third year. This is, of course, a variant of the reduced hours question a matter which has been considered recently in detail in connection with proposals put forward at the International Labour Conference.222. The Commissioner mentions no particular industries to which his proposals might .be applied, but he appears to admit that costs would increase. It is probable that the period of subsidy would be used to introduce a substitute for the more costly human labour and to reduce the number of workers required. Alternatively, there would be reorganisation or speeding up with the same result. If such a reduction was not possible it is hard to see how the subsidy could be discontinued without a return to the longer hours. In great time-working industries such as railways, financial help would be hard to discontinue and the effect would probably be the consolidation of agreed working conditions which tend to discourage the maximum amount of employment.223. The State is already, by the payment of unemployment benefit to short-time workers, subsidising wages to a considerable extent and it is at least open to question whether this has not discouraged the more efficient organisation of these industries.224. There is already a large volume of work and wage sharing, e.g., in the mining industry, and if this is to be increased, the Government must accept the responsibility of interfering seriously with industrial agreements and of introducing compulsorily adjusted wages and hours. It would also have to interfere with the freedom of employers and workers in regard to choice of workers and of employment respectively.225. Seeing that the main part of the unemployment problem is in industries that have been most hardly hit it is hard to justify the payment of a subsidy to industries more favourably placed in order to give their employees reduced hours.226. Assuming that the Government is not prepared to stimulate industrial unrest by taking drastic powers to reduce hours it would appear that its present action in stimulating individual industries to consider means by which they can employ more workers is all that is possible. A compulsory reduction of hours without the reduction of wages would lead to increased costs which in turn would lead to a large number of workers becoming unemployed who are being retained even though businesses are being carried on without profit and even at a loss.Later Entry into Industry.227.   The Commissioner for England and Wales deals with this subject in paragraphs 222 to 227 of his report and proposes that, with a view to reducing unemployment, the employment of children between 14 and 16 should be made [12152] g 2
illegal. It is not contemplated that children between those ages should remain in the Elementary Schools, but that for all those who do not proceed to Secondary Schools a general training devised to fit boys for practical work in industry, and girls for domestic life, should be provided, such training to be continued up to 18 for those who do not obtain employment at 16. The instruction is to be of a definitely practical character, and to be given by specially trained teachers and by shop foremen. The accommodation is to consist of class-rooms, training shops, gymnasia, swimming baths and playgrounds.228. The views of the Board of Education on this scheme are set out in the three following paragraphs.229. The principal objection to the Commissioner^ proposed scheme is its enormous expense. The type of education proposed calls for very costly accommo-dation. Fees would be inadmissible, since attendance would be compulsory, and, indeed, the case for maintenance allowances would be irresistible. The total cost of the scheme cannot be precisely stated, since it would depend on a number of uncertain factors, such as the scales of salary payable to the teachers and foremen and the rates of maintenance allowances in each of the two years, but the Board estimates that the annual cost to public funds would be of the order of from  35,000,000 to  40,000,000, the whole of which would probably have to be borne hy the Exchequer.230. The above rough estimate is based on the assumption that the instruc-tion would be of a full-time character and such an assumption seems necessary, for, although there is a school of thought which favours a system of part-time instruction in the day time as the best method of prolonging education beyond fourteen, this solution pre-supposes that the part-time instruction should be accompanied by part-time employment if available. A system of part-time instruction accompanied by compulsory unemployment would receive no support from educational opinion. If, however, the Commissioner has something less than full-time instruction in mind the estimate would need to be proportionately reduced.231. Apart from the question of cost, the scheme would be unpopular in many quarters. Its unpopularity with the employer of juvenile labour need not be emphasised (the comments of the Ministry of Labour follow below). The parent would dislike it, since it would mean a decrease in the family budget owing to loss of wages for which maintenance allowances would be an inadequate substitute. The teachers would resent the implication that they are incompetent to carry children&apos;s education up to the age of 16, and that the work must therefore be undertaken by shop foremen and instructors trained ad hoc. The Local Education Authorities would probably hold similar views, and would recoil from the expense if they were called upon to bear any share of it. The educationist would be likely to regard the education as too utilitarian in character, since its purpose is to prepare the child for employment rather than for life. In short, there would be likely to be a formidable body of opposition to the Commissioner^ proposal.232. The views of the ministry^ of Labour as to the industrial repercussions of the adoption of a scheme of this nature are given in the three following paragraphs.233. At the end of June 1935 the number of insured juveniles under 16 years of age was 916,000. The number of registered unemployed juveniles under 16 was about 57,000, the majority of whom were in South Wales, the north of England, and Scotland. The Commissioner perhaps underestimates the serious dislocation that would be created in industry by the withdrawal of this available supply of labour. He realises, however, that there are difficulties, and suggests that they could be overcome by re-adjustment of current practice. In the case of some of the older industries (e.g., shipbuilding and repairing, marine engineering and iron and steel) the normal age of recruitment for skilled work is already 16, and the degree of dislocation might not be serious. These industries are situated largely in the areas where there is heavy unemployment and where unemployed juveniles of 14-16 are already attending Junior Instruction Centres. The consequence of withdrawing juvenile labour would be most acute in occupations such as the distributive trades, which employ increasing numbers of juveniles;
textiles, which have always employed large numbers; but, above all, amongst many of the semi-luxury modern trades where processes are highly mechanised. A number of manufacturing trades are complaining of the shortage of juvenile labour in the south of England and in the Midlands, and serious dislocation would result from any sudden restriction in the suppty. It seems desirable, therefore, that, if any steps are taken to withdraw juveniles under 16 years of age, the process should be a gradual one.234. The primary object of the proposal to withdraw from industry boys and girls between 14 and 16 is to make more employment available for older juveniles and adults. It is probable, however, that in a considerable proportion -of cases the withdrawal from the labour market of younger juveniles, and particularly those of 14, would not result in their replacement by adults or older juveniles. In cases where the younger juvenile is now employed on work which is a convenience rather than a necessity to the employer, no replacement would be effected. In other cases the nature of the employment on which young persons of 14 and 15 are engaged makes it difficult, if not impossible, to substitute adults or in some cases older juveniles, and the tendencj? would be towards increased mechanisation or a reorganisation of duties. Nor can it be assumed that, by the withdrawal of the younger workers, those older juveniles or adults taken on in their places would all be drawn from among the registered unemployed. For example, in the case of female workers, the withholding of the supply of girls might attract back into industry many former employees who are married or otherwise withdrawn from a crowded labour market. It must also be borne in mind that, by the time any scheme on the lines proposed by the Commissioner could be brought into operation, the peak years for the numbers of juveniles in the age groups 14 and 15 will have passed. By 1939 a shortage rather than a surplus of juvenile labour is likely to exist in all except the most depressed areas.235. For reasons such as these it is difficult to estimate with any precision the number of additional vacancies that would result from the withdrawal of all juveniles below 16, although there is no doubt that some vacancies now filled by the younger juveniles would be available for the older juveniles and for unemployed adults. It should, however, be noted that by far the largest proportion of such vacancies as ma)&apos;&apos; be created by the withdrawal of juveniles under 16 years of age will be placed in the south of England and the Midlands, and not in the special areas.236. The Ministiy of Labour point out that the present provisions should not be overlooked. Though they do not, of course, compulsorily withhold juveniles from employment, their existence has a considerable bearing upon the question of the necessity for a scheme such as the Commissioner suggests. He recommends that boys and girls between 14 and 16, and those between 16 and 18 who are unable to obtain work, &quot; should be given a compulsory practical training; a -system of general training should be devised to fit a boy for practical work in industry.....   Let us give the girls a similar chance by particularly trainingthem for domestic life.....   There must be given concurrently an intensivephysical training.&quot; It appears that, so far as unemployed boys and girls are concerned, the courses of instruction which are being provided by Local Education Authorities under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1934, are giving the kind of instruction which the Commissioner has in mind. The Junior Instruction Centres are definitely intended to maintain and improve employability, and great emphasis is placed on practical instruction and physical training for both sexes. In the girls&apos; Centres special attention is given to domestic science, needlework, &amp;c. The Act has only been in force a year and the new Scheme is still in its early stages, but the Centres are being established in all areas where they are justified by the state of juvenile unemployment and attendance of unemployed juveniles at them is compulsory unless there is reasonable excuse. Education Authorities are empowered under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1934, to provide medical inspection (and in England and Wales medical treatment also) for unemployed boys and girls in attendance.237. The Board of Education^ views in regard to raising the school age and educational development generally have ahead)? been stated in a Memorandum E. (34) (6) which has been before the Cabinet.
Earlier Retirement and Contributory Pensions.238. The Commissioner for England and Wales, in paragraph 228, recommends &quot; an addition to the contributory pensions scheme, so that the pension payable at the age of 65 would be increased to such a figure as would make retire-ment possible without dependence on other resources. The receipt of this additional pension should, however, be conditional on definite retirement from work.&quot;In the reply to Mr. Lloyd George, it is stated that, &quot; in the Governments view, based on the most careful calculations which can be made, any reasonably fair scheme capable of removing from the field of employment the main proportion of workers who are over 60 years of age would involve additional annual taxation of at least  100,000,000 per&apos;annum.&quot;239. If the age is not 60, as suggested by Mr. Lloyd George, but 65 as proposed by the Commissioner, the comparable figure of cost is about  70,000,000 a year.240. The Commissioner goes on to state in paragraph 229 that &apos;&apos; there are now nearly 700,000 people in work over the age of 65 and, if only one-third of these availed of this inducement to retire, there would be a big field opened for the employment of younger people.&quot;241. The persons who would be induced to retire by an addition to the contributory pension are clearly pensioned insured persons. The number of these is not 700,000 (which is the 1931 Census figure for persons in work aged 65 and over and includes 272,000 classified as in managerial capacities or working on their own account together with a number of workers who have given up work but put themselves down to the occupation they formerly followed), but a much smaller number. The actual figure in 1931 was about 350,000 and of these not more than 200,000 were estimated to be in the trades insured against unemployment. &apos;242. It is convenient to deal here with the suggestion made by the deputa-tion of Northern Members which was received by the Prime Minister regarding (as part of a long-term policy) &quot;the granting of pensions at an earlier age (possibly a start in this direction might be made in certain specially selected industries e.g., coal mining) in view of the fact that there is such a large surplus of workers over 40 in distressed areas.243: Schemes for selected industries have been examined in the past and rejected as impracticable for three main reasons (apart from finance), viz. : (a) Such schemes would involve a levy on industry generally for the benefit of a few selected industries, (b) The selection of industries to benefit would involve invidious distinctions difficult to justify. . (c) The demarcation of the selected industries would be a matter of extreme difficulty. Resentment and jealousy in borderline cases would be wide-spread.244. In paragraphs 270-272 below, reference is made to the suggestion that Government grants might be offered to industries which put up their own money for retirement schemes.Holidays with Pay.245. In paragraph 239 of his report the Commissioner for England and Wales says that a small increase of employment could be effected by making compulsory a week&apos;s holiday with pay for all workers continuously in employment with the same firm.246. There is undoubtedly a growing recognition of the desirability of the gradual extension of paid holidays, which were once the perquisite of office staffs and managerial grades, to other categories of industrial personnel wherever the circumstances of the industry permit. The question arising out of the Commissioners observations is not, however, whether the extension of paid holidays is desirable, but whether a week&apos;s holiday with pay for all workers continuously in employment for one year with the same firm should be made compulsory by State intervention.
247. Up to the present the relatively high development of the system of voluntary collective bargaining in this country has had the result that the conditions of labour are regulated more by that means than by legislation. In the process of collective bargaining the question of the conditions of employment can hardly be divorced from the question of wages. In fact, organisations of workpeople have in general preferred to concentrate on securing increases of wages, or even the shortening of daily or weekty hours, before attempting to obtain the provision of paid holidays.248. If the State were to intervene between the parties to secure the compulsory provision of paid holidays, either the concession would be counter-balanced by a decrease in wages or a failure to secure increased wages, or else other conditions of employment would be effected. Alternatively, the State would find itself obliged to take over the regulation of wages and other conditions including the regulation of employment in order to secure that the workpeople obtained the full benefit of the concession of paid holidays. Such a proposal, if applied to industry generally, would give rise to serious difficulty, particularly as regards industries which have to compete in world markets with low wage countries and which would find it hard to bear any increase in the costs of production.249. Supposing compulsory holidays to be introduced industry by industry, those industries being first chosen in which the reform would present the least difficulty, the effect would be to accentuate the existing disparity between the conditions of workpeople in sheltered and unsheltered industries.250. The effect of legislation to compel the provision of paid holidays would in any case be to upset most of the existing collective agreements, which do not provide for paid holidays. It would, therefore, be a question of weighing the anticipated benefits against the disadvantages of introducing a period of unrest in many industries.251. The strength of the arguments for and against legislation of this kind could only be correctly assessed in the light of the anticipated improvement in employment that would result. The Commissioner refers to this anticipated increase as small. There is little doubt that this estimate is correct. In many firms, and particularly in the smaller ones, the institution of paid holidays would be met by increasing the work of the existing staff rather than by engaging fresh staff.Transference.Survey to Ascertain &quot;Derelict&quot; Places and Differential Treatment.252. In paragraph 197 of his report the Commissioner for England and Wales recommends that a survey of the Special Areas should be made to ascertain their industrial prospects and in paragraph 217 he suggests that, when such a survey had been made, transfer should be intensively applied to the areas adjudged to have no economic future and relaxed in the case of those with better prospects.253. With regard to the suggested survey, the depressed areas were surveyed in detail by the universities in 1931 and again last year by the Investigators, while the Commissioner has given grants to both South Wales and the North-East for further surveys of industrial prospects. Up-to-date information regarding the employment position in the different areas is always available in the Ministry of Labour and the Commissioner himself, through his District Commissioners, is constantly in close touch with the position. In the circumstances, further survey appears difficult to justify.254. The Commissioner thinks that conviction of the lack of industrial future of a given place would be carried to the inhabitants by an announcement after enquiry by an impartial body with which the Trade Unions were associated. There are, however, great political and practical difficulties in contemplating an overt and formal declaration that a particular place is derelict and in any case such a declaration might be most embarrassing to the Government.
255. So far as transference is effected through the Training and Instruc-tional Centres, preference in admission to the Centres could be given to men from the most depressed areas. So far the necessity for this does not seem to have arisen, as the number of suitable volunteers from the Special Areas is not sufficient to fill the Centres and men are drawn also from other areas of heavy unemploy-ment. Every effort, short of compulsion, is made to secure candidates for training from the depressed areas.Preferential Treatment up to 21 (King&apos;s Roll System).256. The Commissioner for England and Wales suggests in paragraph 233 of his Report that youths in the Special Areas with a good record should be given preference for employment out of the areas up to the age of 21, and that a national appeal on the lines of the King&apos;s Roll should be made on their behalf. It is apparently intended that the Employment Exchanges should give a preference in submission to employment to youths from the Special Areas over local youths, up to the age of 21.257. Apart from the unnecessary dislocation involved, local opposition would almost certainly make it impossible to observe such a preference. Moreover, the proposal is hardly justified on merits. The concentration of unemployed youths in particular areas may be dangerous socially, but unemployment for the individual youth in a non-depressed area, where his contemporaries are mostly in work, is at least as serious as unemployment for the youth in a depressed area, where most of his fellows are also unemployed and where special facilities for training and occupation are available.258. The King&apos;s Roll scheme was inaugurated by the King by Royal Proclamation soon after the war in the interests of disabled ex-service men; such an appeal at such a time naturally met with a ready response. An important factor in the strength of the Roll is that, save in exceptional circumstances,. Government contracts are restricted to firms on the Roll. It would clearly be impracticable to have, side by side with the King&apos;s Roll, a second Roll based on the employment of a specified proportion of young men from the Special Areas.. Furthermore, the British Legion would certainly oppose a preference which would be likely to conflict with that given to the ex-service man.259. An appeal to employers by the King is undesirable, as transference is a controversial subject. Although experience suggests that appeals have limited results, it seems that the most which can be done on this point is that the Prime Minister should make an appeal on behalf of the Government.260. There remains the possibility that men under 21 from the Special Areas should also be given preference for admission to the Government Training Centres and the Instructional Centres. All suitable men in the Special Areas who volunteer for admission to a training centre or Instructional Centre can be admitted without any delay, and everything possible is done to bring the training facilities to the notice of suitable men, whether under or over the age of 21 in the Special Areas. If, at any time, the facilities available are not enough to go round amongst all those willing to accept them, it will be time enough to consider whether those under the age of 21 should have an over-riding preference. There seems little likelihood, however, of this position arising so long as recruitment to the centres remains voluntary.Part C. Suggestions not Mentioned in the Commissioners&apos; Reports but putforward in other ways.261. The suggestions dealt with in this Part of the Report are those made by the Bishop of Llandaff&apos;s Committee (a non-party conference of representatives of industrial opinion in South Wales, which met to consider the Commissioners report) and by the deputation of Northern Members of Parliament which the Prime Minister received in July. It also deals with certain other suggestions, including those of the Investigators who visited the Areas in 1934 which have not been adopted by the Commissioners or otherwise.
Industry.Government Orders and Factories.262. The question of the placing of Government orders in the Special Areas is referred to in paragraphs 101-103 above and the possibility of a price preference being given to firms in the Special Areas is dealt with in paragraphs 104-107. A number of other suggestions on the subject have been made.263. Lord Portal in his Report suggested the establishment of a Govern-ment factory in South Wales, it being understood that he had Woolwich Arsenal in mind. The more general suggestion the Commissioner, after discussion with the Contracts Co-ordinating Committee, has decided not to adopt, and there seems to be no good reason to differ from him. As to Woolwich Arsenal, its removal to South Wales was specifically suggested by the Bishop of LlandafTs Committee; the Cabinet, before the recess, decided to appoint an inter-departmental Committee to consider inter alia &quot; the possibility and desirability of establishing some part of the Filling Factory at some site in South Wales.&quot; The Committee, which includes representatives of the War Office, Ministry of Labour, Ministry of Health, Scottish Office and Treasury, has been constituted, and is meeting shortly.264. Sir J. Davidson in his Report suggested a thorough examination of West Cumberland from the Strategic point of view. The Commissioner has put the claims of West Cumberland before the Air Ministry, who, accordingly, have the position in mind.265. Lord Portal proposed that the Government should offer ten-year firm contracts to any large producers who would undertake to produce in South Wales. The Inter-Departmental Committee reported in regard to this proposal that &quot;it is doubtful if any contractor would wish to be bound to a running contract for as long as ten years &quot; and that &quot; if a contractor in South Wales secured his contract in the ordinary way, there is no point in giving him a ten-year term; if he produces elsewhere this concession is hardly likely to induce him to go to South Wales.&quot; The Commissioner, it can now be added, has discussed the suggestion with the Contracts Co-ordinating Committee and decided not to adopt it.  It does not seem useful to pursue this suggestion further.266. Two further suggestions have been made. One is that consideration should be given to the establishment in the Special Areas of new units of industry directly concerned with Government orders. Whenever the question of establishing a new unit of industry for Government orders arises, the fullest consideration is already given to its location in a Special Area. Examples of the establishment of such units are rare, but the matter is under consideration in regard to the Filling Factory (see paragraph 263 above), and will be considered in connection with the production of respirators.267. The other is that standing co-ordinating machinery, representing at any rate the Defence Departments, the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Transport, might be established to direct into the Special Areas Government orders, or orders which the Government can influence. So far as Government orders are concerned, a co-ordinating organisation of the type referred to already exists in the Contracts Co-ordinating Committee which is composed of repre-sentatives of the principal contracting departments and of the Treasury. This Committee was set up by the Cabinet in 1920 on the dissolution of the Ministry of Munitions to secure economy and eliminate the forcing up of prices by competition. In carrying out this duty the Committee is naturally called upon to consider general questions of policy in the placing of Government contracts, e.g., how far it is possible to give preference to contractors using plant and material of home or Empire origin, whether contracts should be restricted to firms on the King&apos;s Roll, and how far it is desirable to discourage overtime or Sunday work in Government contracts. The question of price preference is discussed in paragraphs 104-107 above, and the use of the Employment Exchanges in paragraphs 197-211.Restriction on the Employment of Women.268.   Captain Wallace in his report suggested that it is necessary to consider seriously some limitation on the fields of female labour.   The Inter-Departmental .    [12152] &quot;   H
Committee reporting on this in October, 1934, drew attention to the absence of evidence that women have displaced men in industry, to the confusion which the exclusion of women would cause in wages and costs in numerous industries, and to the opposition to be expected from the women&apos;s movement.A dmission of Iron-Ore Miners to Coal-Mining.269. Sir J. Davidson in his report recommended that, if coal-mining develops, the restrictions on entry into the industry under Section 18 of the Alining Industry Act, 1926, should be relaxed as regards Cumberland iron-ore miners. This suggestion might Avell be considered if the condition on which it is based should be fulfilled. In fact, there has been no such development. It is also of importance in this connection that the Mineworkers&apos; Federation has recently informed the Minister of Labour that in its view there should be no relaxation in the restrictions or in their administration.Grants to Firms Instituting Pensions Schemes.270. In dealing with the Commissioner^ proposal for earlier retirement and contributory pensions above, it was mentioned in paragraph 244 that there was another suggestion on the subject. This is as follows : &quot; Assuming that no general scheme for retiring men from industry at 60 or 65 is possible, Government grants might be offered to industries which put up their own money for retirement schemes, e.g., South Wales mining industry.&quot;271. State grants for this purpose are subsidies for specific industries not different in principle from subsidies to reduce hours, which we have discussed on the Commissioners&apos; proposal in paragraphs 221-226. Moreover, assistance in the circumstances contemplated appears to involve State grants only to those industries which can&apos; put up money for themselves (it will be remembered that a number of prosperous firms already have pension schemes applying not merely to managerial and office staffs but to operatives). The less prosperous would be contributing in taxation part of the cost of what the more prosperous enjoyed. On the other hand, if there is to be a sort of &quot;needs test &quot; for industries as a condition of assistance, there would probably have to be instituted a scheme of retirement pensions at State expense for most of the staple industries of the country, and in practice it would be difficult to stop short of the general scheme which is assumed to be impracticable.Increased Tariffs.272. One of the proposals of the Bishop of llandaff&apos;s Committee is for &quot; the introduction or increase of tariffs wherever necessary to encourage and protect existing and new industries.&quot; The Import Duties Act, 1932, already provides means for increasing the rates of import duty on any class of goods when the needs of the home industry require it. Application can be made by any home industry to the Import Duties Advisory Committee and on the recom-mendation of that Committee a Customs duty can be increased hy Order of the Treasury. Constant use is already being made of this power. It may be, of course, that an increased duty would stimulate the industry in other districts rather than in the Special Areas; but it is not understood that it is proposed that a special Customs area should be instituted for South Wales.Railway Rates and Dock Dues.273. The investigators, in their reports, referred to the effect of railway and dock dues in the Special Areas; the deputation of Northern Members urged the reduction of railway freight charges and the Bishop of llandaff&apos;s Committee stated that the high rates charged by the railways constitute the greatest handicap to industry in South Wales and urged immediate steps to secure a drastic reduction of freights and dock dues.274. The charges for the conveyance of merchandise by railway are regulated by the provisions of the Railways Act, 1921, and they have been reviewed annually since 1928 by the Railway Rates Tribunal.   Evidence given before the Tribunal
has shown that each year the railway companies have earned substantially less than their standard revenue.Actual Net Revenue	Standard	Actual Net	Less than	StandardYear.	Revenue.	Revenue.

On the occasion of the last review the Railway Rates Tribunal stated after considering representations by the Mining Association of Great Britain and by the British Iron and Steel Federation that, in their view, a general reduction of charges would not in the circumstances of to-day enable any of the Railway Companies to improve its net revenue.276. It therefore appears that any reduction in railway rates in the present circumstances of the companies would be impracticable. Indeed, it is possible that the carriage costs of those concerned in the export coal, iron and steel, agricultural, &amp;c, industries, whose traffics are subject to rebates under the Railway Freight Rebates Scheme, may be increased in the near future by reason of the reductions in rebate rates which would follow if the Railway and Canal Commission Judgment in regard to Railway Assessments is upheld in the House of Lords.277. The complaints that railway rates in Cumberland were excessive were very fully inquired into a few months ago, and the evidence submitted by the Traders did not indicate either that railway rates in Cumberland are generally higher than those in operation in like circumstances in other districts, or that the railway rates in that area are excessive.278. The relative disparity in certain rates referred to by the traders seems to be due to the fact that the old exceptional rates in force prior to the 1st January, 1928, were, at the request of the traders, continued from that date under section 36 of the Railways Act, 1921, except where the new standard rate was lower. These arrangements and others made in 1894 have no doubt created many anomalies in all parts of Great Britain, but traders would certainly resist strongly an attempt to raise abnormally low rates, which have been in operation for many years, up to normal levels, and to remove the anomalies by levelling down only would be unsound, and would seriously affect the revenues of the railway companies.279. The inquiry indicated that the troubles of the complainants are due to a large extent to the geographical position of their works. The coal, iron ore and limestone industries in West Cumberland used to depend mainly upon the demands of local iron and steel, &amp;o, works. The latter were probably established in that area in order to be near the raw materials which they required. The closing down of many of the works has greatly reduced the consumption of raw materials and manufactured articles, and Cumberland firms, owing to their geographical position, find it difficult to compete in other consuming districts.280. The Ministry of Transport has no evidence which supports the allegation in the memorandum from the Bishop of Llandaff and others that the high rates charged by the railway companies for the transport and handling of goods constitute the &quot;greatest handicap to industry in South Wales. It should be added that in recent years substantial benefits have been derived from the operation of the railway freight rebates scheme, amounting in some cases to a rebate of from 12-J- per cent, to 33^ per cent, of the charges. (Reference has been made above to the&quot; altered position which may arise if the House of Lords uphold the recent decision of the Railway and Canal Commission.)
281. Any monopoly which the railway companies may have enjoyed years ago has been impaired by the development of the internal combustion engine and the consequent competition of road transport. It is misleading, also, to suggest that, owing to Government action, no redress can be obtained by private traders. The latter can, at any time, apply to the Railway Rates Tribunal to fix new exceptional rates, and the private Acts which regulate the charges at railway-owned docks in South Wales contain clauses which enable traders to obtain a review of the charges. No case has been made out for the promotion of the legis-lation which would be necessary to enable Government action to be taken to secure &quot; a drastic reduction of freights and dock dues.&quot;Coal Gas Vehicles.282. Lord Portal, in his report, drew attention to the possibilities of the development of vehicles using compressed coal gas as fuel. This question has engaged the active attention of the Secretary for Mines for some time past, and representations have been made to the Minister of Transport, to which the Commissioner has added his weight, for the granting of additional assistance, in the form of tax relief on the weight of the cylinders, for this new market for coal products. The Minister, after consulting the Chancellor of the Exchequer, replied that, in view of the benefits already enjoyed by gas-driven vehicles and of the additional benefit which may result from the recently increased taxation of heavy oil fuel for road transport, he could see no grounds for further action.Coal Export Agreement with Italy.283. Lord Portal also suggested the negotiation of a trade agreement with Italy on the same lines as those concluded with Scandinavian countries. The difficulties at present affecting the export of coal to Italy are due to causes beyond the control of the Government, notably the problem of securing payment for coal exported, but the Board of Trade and the Mines Department have already had the matter in hand for some months, and nothing more can be done for the present.South Wales Hydrogenation Plant.284. Lord Portal also drew attention to this matter. The proposal to erect hydrogenation plant in South Wales is at present being considered separately, in conjunction with Imperial Chemical Industries.Iron Ore Royalties.285. Sir J. Davidsohs proposal to redeem all royalties on iron ore so as to reduce the burden on that industry implies going beyond even the stage of unification of royalties, to that of handing the royalties back to the industry. The expense which this would entail would be considerable. At a meeting which the Secretary for Mines had recently with the Iron Ore producers, he was told that they had now come to amicable arrangements with nearly all the Royalty owners, and had no complaints in that direction, except one in reference to an individual. The latter trouble could probably be effectively dealt with under the Working facilities legislation, provided that the position created by the recent Appeal Court decision in the Consett case is put right. This question is embodied in the Cabinet Memorandum already referred to, viz., C.M.L. (35) 2.286. In any case the position generally in the West Coast iron ore industry has greatly improved since Sir J. Davidsohs inquiry, as is shown by the following-figures :.&apos;   1 January-June 1933. 1934. 1935.Production of  Tons. Tons. Tons.Iron Ore ...      283,300 404,000 411,100Pig Iron ...       233,600 323,700 340,600Public Works.Nationalisation of Main Roads.287. Certain proposals for transfer of responsibility for the maintenance of and improvement of trunk roads from county councils to the central government have been recently considered by the Treasury, Scottish Office, Ministry of Health
and Ministry of Transport. The Government, while deciding not to include these proposals in the legislative programme of 1935, has reserved them for further consideration.Reconstruction of Weak Bridges by Loan secured on the Road Fund.288. Grants from the Road Fund towards the cost of reconstruction of privately owned weak bridges on roads are now available at the rate of 75 per cent, and, if they are situate on trunk roads, still higher rates apply in certain counties. These works will form part of the Five Years&apos; programme estimated to cost  100 million,  70 million being found from the Road Fund.289. It is anticipated that the expenditure on this programme can be met out of the revenues of the Road Fund without borrowing and no proposal for the reconstruction of a weak bridge has been refused on the ground of lack of funds. No large increase in the number of weak bridges to be reconstructed, such as would involve a considerable increase in the estimated expenditure on the Five Years&apos; Programme is likely to be practicable for technical or traffic reasons. It it were necessary to have recourse to borrowing any loan raised would better be made applicable either to the general purposes of the Road Fund or one or two long-term schemes and not be earmarked for the reconstruction of weak bridges.Other Measures of Social Improvement.National Council of Social Service.290. The Commissioner for England and Wales in paragraph 132 of his Report records that he decided to adopt the policy of centralising his grants for social service work through the National Council of Social Service. He offers no criticism and makes no suggestions.291. There are two points, however, which require mention. In the first place, the Council, apart from its income from voluntary sources and that of the local bodies associated with it, is now grant-aided by both the Ministry of Labour and the Commissioner. It is of importance that this should not result in overlaps and the possibility of a local scheme getting money from two Govern-ment sources, and various suggestions have been made for avoiding this risk. The Ministry of Labour and the Commissioner, as well as the officers of the Council, have the matter prominently in mind and it seems best to leave it to them to make administrative arrangements to meet the difficulty as and where it arises, rather than to adopt in its entirety any one of the suggestions made.292. In the second place, the increase this year of the Ministry of Labour&apos;s grant and the provision of even larger sums by the Commissioner means not only an expansion of the Council&apos;s activities but a much greater direct Government responsibility for them. As the grants increase, it becomes more difficult for the Government to maintain a negative attitude towards the Council&apos;s administra-tion of them. On the other hand, nothing is so likely to take the life out of the idea of voluntary social service as direct administration and inspection by State officials. Here again, a variety of suggestions have been put forward, but in this case also the best course seems to be to leave it to the Ministry of Labour and the Commissioner, who are constantly watching the situation, to make all necessary arrangements. Possibly the best course will be for the Ministry of Labour to make increased grants to the Council to strengthen their Headquarters and local administration and to lend the Council one or two experienced officials to assist in Headquarters administration and regional organisation.Transference, &amp;c.293. The Commissioner^ genera] recommendation that every inducement should be offered to those wishing to transfer, has. been dealt with in paragraphs 128-131 above, and the possibility of preferential terms or requiring the use of the Employment Exchanges in paragraphs 197-211. A number of specific suggestions on the subject fall to be dealt with here.
Grants to Employers to Train Workpeople for new Industries.294. The Bishop of llandaff&apos;s Committee has suggested a special grant to firms setting up new industries within the area which involve skilled processes, to cover the additional expense involved by the training of local unemployed to proficiency in the trades. The suggestion has not been elaborated, but in its simplest form it merely involves a payment to firms setting up new industries in the Special Areas which will compensate them for the fact that skilled men will not be available in those areas, and that they will have to take on unskilled men and teach them the processes of the industry. There is nothing administratively impracticable in this suggestion subject to satisfactory safeguards being made to ensure that the employers concerned will, in fact, continue to employ, when trained, any men in respect of whom they have received a grant for an initial period of training. The difficulty is that the proposal involves the wider question of principle, namely, how far it is sound policy to subsidise individual employers to compensate them for any disadvantages arising from the location of their factory in a Special Area. This would, in fact, be a direct subsidy towards the costs of running a business working for profit. This objection may prove fatal to the proposal.295. It may here be noted that in the case of juveniles grants are already paid to the juveniles themselves where the wages are insufficient to cover their living expenses while living away from home, and consideration is now being given to proposals submitted by the Engineering Employers&apos; Federation for the payment of these grants up to the age of 21.296. There can be no doubt that any scheme for subsidising employers to compensate them for having to teach unskilled men the new processes cannot be a satisfactory alternative to the system of institutional training in a Government Training Centre. It has often been suggested that the Government should adopt a scheme of training for men in employers&apos; workshops at the Governments expense. The usual dorm of this suggestion is that the employer should give the training and that the Government should pay the maintenance allowances or wages during the necessary period of training. A good deal of experience of this system was obtained in the years immediately after the War on the scheme for training disabled ex-Service men, and that experience shows that the scheme cannot work satisfactorily. Government control and supervision of training given by employers in their own workshops is very difficult to give effectively. Schemes of this kind inevitably lead to fairly widespread exploitation by employers who will make the best use of a man while he is qualified to receive Government allowances, and will then find some excuse for replacing instead of continuing to employ him. The purpose of any employer partaking in a scheme of this kind must necessarily be to get productive value out of the men as soon as possible, and thorough and intensive training will necessarily be sacrificed to this end. The object of the Government Training Centres, however, is to give the man a sound grounding in all the processes of his occupation, so that he may be suitable for any employer and not merely capable of giving productive value on one limited process. If, therefore, any grant on the lines suggested by the Bishop of llandaff&apos;s Committee were instituted, it would have to be recognised that this was not part of a sound training scheme designed to equip men for employment with employers generally, and it should only be utilised where the Government Training Scheme was for some reason inappropriate.Longer Course of Training for Craftsmen.297. Lord Portal in his report on his investigation into the Special Areas, suggested that the course of training given in the Government Training Centres was too short, and that the men should remain in training for a period of from nine to twelve months in those courses in which the occupation was dependent entirely on individual skill and craftsmanship. The period of six months in training has been based on the experience of a number of years, and it jjresupposes that the man in training is of a sufficient standard of intelligence to absorb intensive instruction. The progress of men during training is marked by trade tests which qualify them to advance to the next stage of training, and it has been found that so far from a six months&apos; period being too short, it is now usually possible for a man to pass his final test a few weeks earlier, when he is fully
qualified to take his place in industry and earn sufficient for his maintenance to start with. Experience has shown that the continuation of institutional training for much longer than six months does not result in any further improvement in the man&apos;s qualifications, but may, on the other hand, result in some deterioration. However long a period of institutional training may be, it is impossible to give the necessary speed to enable a man to earn as much as a fully skilled man. In the Centres the man can learn how to do a thing, but can only learn how to do it at full speed by practice on productive work in the early stages of his employment with an employer working for production. There seems no reason to suppose that the period of six months in the Centre is not sufficient to do what it is intended to do.Subsidies to Parents to Revive Apprenticeship.298. The deputation of Northern Members mentioned the possibility of subsidies to parents of children for the revival of apprenticeship. The falling off in the system of apprenticeship is due largely to changes in methods of production and to the substitution for apprenticeship of a short period of learnership with wages. In occupations where apprenticeship is still the normal form of entry, the reduction in the numbers of apprentices is a reflection, to the state of employment. There is no evidence that a State subsidy to parents in respect of apprentices is called for, or that it would make any valuable contribution to a reduction in unemployment. The subsidy would, presumably, have to be paid in all areas and in respect of all forms of apprenticeship. A maintenance grant is already paid in approved cases in respect of juveniles transferred to apprenticeships away from home, in cases where the monetary payment is insufficient to meet all living expenses. This is a form of State subsidy which can be directed to cases where it is most needed.Preparatory Training Centres.299. Lord Portal, in his report, suggested that preparatory training centres in some of the most seriously depressed areas should be set up with a view to fitting men to enter a Government Training Centre. He found that an appreciable number of applicants for training lack or have forgotten what they learnt at school, and have not the mental agility to assimilate an intensive six months&apos; course. He suggested that this could be remedied by a preparatory course at a preparatory training centre. The Ministry of Labour are carrying out an experi-ment to test the value of the suggestion. A preparatory centre is in course of preparation at Merthyr Tydfil at which men who can attend daily will be given preparatory training for half-time each day. It is to be hoped that this centre will serve the purpose of enabling a good number of men who cannot at present be accepted in the Government Training Centres to brush up their knowledge, and to acquire some elementary facility in the handling of tools, which will enable them to be given a proper course of training at a training centre afterwards. It may also result in arousing the interest of men sufficiently to make them willing to leave home and go to a training centre who at present cannot bring themselves to leave their homes because their interest in training has not been sufficiently aroused. The Ministry are proposing to extend the system if the experiment at Merthyr Tydfil proves successful.Miscellaneous.Rational Development A uthority.800. Attention has been directed to the possibility of establishing a &quot; joint regional body of the Durham and Tyneside Local Authorities for the purpose of housing, transport, site-development, &amp;c,&quot; the State to place at the disposal of this combined Authority grants sufficient to meet the whole, or nearly the whole, of its expenditure; it has been further suggested that the proposal might be worked out on the basis of a statutory Central Development Board with power to establish local Boards in the Special Areas.301. The work of such an authority, dealing with housing, transport, site-development, and the like, would overlap many of the functions of County Borough Councils, County Councils and County District Councils. This would be reduced if the Regional Authority were confined to carrying out capital works
of a large kind. But there is not much scope for such works unless comprehensive replanning is to be undertaken, and it seems doubtful whether this would be worth while unless there is much more prospect of attracting industries. In Tyneside, in particular, the area with best prospects of this kind, it would be awkward to embark on this venture when the general question of local government areas is being considered by a Royal Commission, appointed on the recommendation made by Captain Euan Wallace in his report.302. Even if the capital cost were met wholly out of central funds, main-tenance would still have to be locally borne, and for some works this might be substantial.303. If the Regional Authority were representative of Local Authorities it would probably be a large body not likely to work with despatch. If a body appointed by the Government, it might be looked on with some jealousy by the Local Authorities, even though it came with gifts. In either case, negotiations would probably be inevitable with Local Authorities before works were carried out, and these are apt to take time, and there would be duplication of staff. Generally, it may be said that the more the number of Authorities the more the delays. For the carrying out of works involving two or more Authorities if the Government were prepared to pay the whole, or nearly the whole, cost, more rapid progress would probably be made by seconding a central officer for settling matters and for securing despatch.304. If the principal object be to attract industries, this would probably be better effected through the existing Development Council, with any measures desirable to render it more effective. Efficiency in this work depends primarily upon securing the services of one or more men of special competence, paying the necessary remuneration for this purpose.Separate Commissioner for South Wales.305. The Bishop of llandaff&apos;s Committee suggested the appointment of a separate Commissioner for the Special Areas of Wales and the provision of a substantial fund amounting to not less than two million pounds to be placed at his disposal, in addition to the funds required for the original purposes of the Act, to enable the Commissioner to finance the introduction of new industries in South Wales.306. The Special Areas Act gives power to the Minister of Labour, with the consent of the Treasury, to appoint a deputy Commissioner if representations as to the desirability of such a course have been made to him by the Commissioner. The Commissioner has appointed three non-statutory District Commissioners; one of these, Captain Crawshay, acts as his representative in South Wales. Captain Crawshay comes of a family well known in Wales; he has been a County Councillor for Monmouthshire and has been closely associated with the social service movement in Wales. He is universally respected and popular, though it is understood that certain critics maintain that he has not got enough industrial experience or background. The Commissioner is satisfied with the present arrangement and has made no representations to the Minister of Labohr as to the desirability of exercising powers under Section 2 (1) of the Special Areas Act.307. There is a separate Commissioner for Scotland and it is not unnatural that the Welsh Nationalists should demand a separate Commissioner for Wales. The cases are not, however, quite on all fours. Most Government activities are carried out in Scotland through special Scottish Departments responsible to the Secretary of State for Scotland. Government activity in Wales is hi the hands of Departments operating from Whitehall. The appointment of two Commis-sioners, one for England and one for Scotland, has given rise to certain difficulties when divergent policy has been adopted, especially in the matter of publicity grants. This difficulty would be far greater if there were a separate Commissioner for Wales. There is clearly need for a common line of policy in regard to all the Special Areas, and the money voted by Parliament for the Special Areas must be used as equitably as possible between the areas. Moreover, the Commissioner has found it essential in carrying out his duties under the Act to maintain through his officers daily and in some cases almost hourly contact with some half-dozen Government Departments situated in London.     A Welsh
Commissioner, whose office would presumably be in Cardiff, would be severely handicapped through lack of direct contact with these Departments. The Commissioner is fully informed of Welsh feeling and aspirations through his District Commissioner, and apart from national sentiment there is nothing to be said in favour of a separate Welsh Commissioner.308. No doubt those who made the suggestion contemplated that the Welsh Commissioner should have wide powers in the exercise of his functions. The money placed at his disposal would, however, have to be voted by Parliament; some Minister would have to be responsible to Parliament for the manner in which it is used and someone would have to account for expenditure to the Public Accounts Committee. These necessities involve close contact between the Commissioner and the Minister responsible to Parliament, and make it impossible to give any substantial measure of autonomy to a Commissioner situated in Wales or anywhere else.309. The suggestion contemplated that over and above the ordinary funds at the disposal of the proposed Welsh Commissioner, a sum of not less than two million pounds should be given to him to finance the introduction of new industries in South Wales. This would be a direct Government subsidy to private enterprise and would be entirely contrary to the decision reached by the Cabinet last year and confirmed by Parliament that the Commissioner should not have power to give financial assistance to undertakings carried on for profit. If, however, the Government decide to allow the Special Areas Fund or any other Fund to be used for the purpose of stimulating new industry in Wales, they could do so by agreeing to the proposal already made by Mr. Stewart that a grant for that purpose should be made, subject to proper conditions, to the South Wales and Monmouthshire Development Council. No separate Welsh Commissioner is necessary for this purpose.310. On the question of financing new industries generally, see paragraphs 137-148 above.Medical Examination of Unemployed Juveniles.311. Sir J. Davidson in his report suggested that the medical examination of unemployed boys and girls should be considered. Local Education Authorities have a power, though not a duty, to provide for the medical inspection and treat-ment of unemployed boys and girls who are in attendance at Junior Instruction Centres. Neither the Board of Education nor the Ministry of Labour have complete information as to the extent to which this power is being exercised, but it is known that in some areas the work of the School Medical Service extends to these Centres, and the Ministry of Labour are obtaining fuller information from their Divisional Officers. Both the Board and the Ministry desire that the powers of Local Education Authorities in this matter should be fully exercised. It is, however, doubtful whether it would be possible to place a duty upon Local Educa-tion Authorities to inspect all pupils attending the Centres as the personnel of the Centres changes so frequently that arrangements for the routine medical inspection of all pupils would be impracticable. Where the inspection and treatment of the pupils involves the Local Education Authority in additional expenditure, the Ministry of Labour are prepared to recognise the expenditure for the purposes of their grant. At present this recognition is limited to expenditure involved in the inspection and treatment of pupils referred to the Medical Officer by the Superintendent of the Centre, but the Ministry are considering the advisability of approaching the Treasury with a view to the removal of this limitation.312. Considerably less than half of the boys and girls between 14 and 18 years of age who are registered for employment are attending Junior Instruction Centres. The proportion will, however, increase during the coming Autumn when several new Centres will be opened. Moreover, it must be remembered that the residue consists mainly of small groups of boys and girls in areas where the provision of Junior Instruction Centres is impracticable, or of boys and girls who are passing from one post to another and are on the registers for very short periods. Legislation would be required in order to place on Local Authorities an obligation to provide for the medical inspection of unemployed [12152]       &quot; i
boys and girls who are not attending Junior Instruction Centres. Such provision would present considerable difficulty and it seems doubtful whether it is necessary.Physical Training College.313. The question has been raised whether two new Physical Training Colleges in Durham and South Wales should be established, as the existing College at Leeds will be insufficient to supply enough expert teachers for the increasing demands. The primary function of the Carnegie Physical Training College at Leeds is to train full-time teachers of Physical Training for service in schools. In co-operation with the National Council of Social Service the College has also held short courses for unemployed men to be trained to instruct others. It may prove that additional Training College accommodation is needed at Leeds or elsewhere, though probably it would be preferable to wait awhile before deciding this. At present the College is full with a small waiting list. In any case any additional accommodation would be available for would-be teachers from all parts of the country and would not have any specific relation to the Special Areas.314. On the other hand, especially in view of the greater interest how focussed on Physical Training, there is a heed for institutions which, by courses shorter than one or two years, can train Physical Training leaders for clubs and similar organisations. To meet this need the possibility is now being actively considered of aiding by grant the Lucas Tooth Institute in Befmondsey to enable it to be transferred to another site and enlarged. This Institution trains leaders for clubs, &amp;o, and also holds short courses in leadership for unemployed men from all parts of the country. The time may come when a second institution of this character will be needed and if so it might well be in one of the Special Areas, e.g., South Wales or Tyneside.Part D. Commissioners&apos; Powers.315. A number of the points which have been raised regarding the limita-tions upon the powers of the Commissioners have been dealt with either directly or by implication above. It will, however, be convenient to bring them together in a separate Part of the report.Ministerial Control.318. The Commissioners act under the general control of the appropriate Minister and are consequently subject to orthodox Parliamentary control. The Commissioner for England and Wales admits that this control has not actually hampered his freedom of initiative, but says it restricts his freedom to carry his proposals into effect. As the Minister is himself answerable to Parliament for the actions of the Commissioner, it is inevitable that the Commissioner should be subject to orthodox financial control. It is not exercised to impede or delay the Commissioner but to see that he does not undertake functions which can better be performed by existing Departments already possessing the necessary machinery and experience, and does not initiate activities which the Minister could not defend to Parliament. The Scottish Commissioner did not refer to the point in his Report. The Bishop of llandaff&apos;s Committee suggested that the Special Welsh Commissioner, whose appointment it proposed, should be &quot;empowered to act at his own discretion.&quot; In view of what has just been said it seems unnecessary to comment in detail on this suggestion.Relief Schemes (Limitation to those of Economic Value).317. This restriction is dealt with in paragraphs 184-189 above. Briefly, the point is that, as an administrative arrangement, the Commissioner for England and Wales only assists schemes which have value in facilitating the economic development or social improvement of the Areas. This has hindered work on such things as removal of slag heaps. It will be seen, however, that the Commissioner is in agreement with this limitation and has hopes of getting done as amenity schemes by voluntary labour the work which the restriction
might be held to prevent. In any case, the administrative arrangement can always be altered if circumstances show a change to be desirable; this is not a restriction imposed by the Act.Restriction on Supplementing a Specific Grant.318. The Commissioner for England and Wales complained of this restric-tion in paragraph 6 of his report, and it has received a good deal of criticism. The Commissioners proposal now is that &quot; it would be desirable to obtain an understanding that certain Government Departments, notably the Ministry of Transport, would undertake to give favourable consideration to representations made by him for higher rates of grant to Local Authorities in respect of works which, in the Commissioner&apos;s view, have an economic or industrial value, but which cannot be undertaken by the Authority with the normal rate of grant  this higher rate of grant to be given on the Commissioners recommendation to (i) impoverished Local Authorities in the Special Areas, and (ii) Authorities in other parts willing to undertake important public works which would give employment to substantial numbers of persons from the Special Areas.&quot; The objections to this proposal are given in paragraphs 160-174 above.Restriction where Grant is &quot; Payable &quot; but not Paid.319. This is the restriction which has caused the most comment. The Commissioner for England and Wales complained of it in paragraph 6 of his report, and the Bishop of llandaff&apos;s Committee and the deputation of Northern Members both proposed the repeal of Section 1 (5) (ii), on which it is based.320. The reading of the Act upon which administration has proceeded is that, where a Government Department has the power to make a grant, the Commissioner cannot do so, even though the Department does not, in fact, make a grant. The Law Officers are to be asked for an opinion whether this view is correct.321. The proposal of the Commissioner for England and Wales now is that he should &quot; have the power, after consultation with any Government Department concerned, to give a grant to a. Local Authority for work having economic value in respect of which that Government Department, though having the power to make a grant, are not prepared to make a grant or able to exercise the power to do so.&quot;322. This proposal raises in some degree the objections set out in para-graphs 160-174 above, ahd, unless the Law Officers advise that the view of the meaning of the Act on which administration has proceeded is wrong, would require legislation to adopt.323. In paragraph 172 above, however, there is the suggestion that if it is decided that, notwithstanding the dangers, there should be some extension of assistance to public works in the Special Areas, it should be confined to cases of this sort, viz., where no Government grant is in practice payable at present, and that it should be done by means of a recommendation by the Commissioner to the /Government Department concerned. This is a power which the Commissioners already possess under Section 1 (3) (b) of the Act. The suggestion, moreover, follows the Commissioners own statement in paragraph 22 of his report that &quot;it is clearly uneconomical and inefficient for the Commissioner to initiate activities which can better be performed by existing Departments already possessing the necessary machinery and experience.Restriction on Grants to Industries Operating for Profit.324. The Commissioners may not give direct financial assistance to under -takings carried on for the purpose of gain. The Commissioner for England and Wales refers to this as &apos;&apos; clearly desirable &apos;&apos;; the Scottish Commissioner does not mention it.325. The question whether further methods for giving financial assistance to new industries are needed is discussed in paragraphs 137-148 above. What-ever is decided, it would not appear necessary or desirable to amend this provision of the Act.
Definition of the Special A reas.326. The Act defines the Areas rigidly and excludes parts of Durham and, more particularly, Cardiff, Newport and Swansea. The Commissioner for England and Wales in paragraph 6 of his report says that this &quot; has not led to serious inconvenience in the North, though it would have been simpler if the whole of County Durham had been included/&apos; but that in Wales the definition &quot;has created ail artificial boundary within an established industrial region.&quot; The deputation of Northern Members suggested that the Special Area should embrace Tees-side and the Bishop of LlandafPs Committee asked for the preparation of a new Schedule upon more comprehensive lines to include &quot; the whole of the South Wales and Monmouthshire coalfield and the industrial areas and their seaboards.&quot;327. The line of definition is arbitrary, and admittedly produces anomalies. The fact that in South Wales (and in Scotland) the Commissioner must work through a Development Council whose headquarters are outside the Special Areas and whose jurisdiction includes other areas, is no doubt inconvenient. None of the places excluded, however, can be regarded as &quot; derelict &quot; in the sense of many that are now in the Schedule to the Act, and a dispersal of experimental effort at this early stage is not considered desirable. More important, if the Schedule is amended, the pressure of Lancashire and other areas of severe industrial depression to be included will be renewed and, should Cardiff and Swansea, or other industrial towns in Durham be added, it will be difficult to resist.   A change would, of course, require legislation.Powers outside Great Britain.328. The Act does not apply outside the United Kingdom. It was not intended that it should and an opinion of the Law Officers has confirmed that this is the case.329. It may be unfortunate, as the Commissioner for England and Wales complains, that one consequence of this limitation should be to prevent assistance being rendered to the Child Emigration Society to establish a farm in New Zealand for special area children and thus increase the flow of migration from this country. It can be argued, however, that questions of migration are best treated as a whole and not in terms of the Special Areas and that the general principle applies of leaving such activities to existing Departments already possessing the necessary machinery and experience.330. Another consequence has been that the Commissioners have been unable to assist advertising abroad. A suggestion for dealing with this matter will be found in paragraphs 99-100 above.331. In the circumstances no change, for which legislation would be required seems necessary.Powers outside the Special Areas.332. The Commissioners&apos; powers extend, by Section 1 (6) of the Act, to the &quot; initiation, organisation, prosecution and assistance of measures outside the Special Areas in so far as they are satisfied that such measures will afford employment or occupation for substantial numbers of persons from those areas.&quot;333. Both Commissioners mention in their reports that, on a reading of the Section (which has not been submitted to the Law Officers), this has debarred them from assisting hostels outside the Areas for persons from the Areas and the Commissioner for England and Wales has suggested adding the phrase &quot; facilitating employment &quot; for this purpose. The position as regards hostels is described in paragraphs 135-136 above and it is not necessary to make the change, which would need legislation, for that reason alone. If other cases come to light the matter might be reconsidered.
A ? P E N D I X____.XX oSUMMARY OF THE CABINET: GQTtMITTEE&apos;S CONCLUSIONS ON THE POINTS DEALT WITH &quot;BY&quot; THE INTER-DEPART!-CENTAL COMMITTEE./Note 2-   The headings and arrangement follow the printed Report/^A. Work of the CommissionersEmphasis should he laid upon what has already teen done hy the Commissioners and upon the diverse nature of their activities. The cumulative effect of the many individual experiments made hy the Commissioners should also he brought out.B. Suggestions of the Commlsgloners(i)Suggestions which, under existing policy or departmental authority, could be accepted in whole or in part.Industry,The existing situation in the Special Areas,  particularly the reduction in the population, should be taken into consider-ation in revising the formula for block grants to local authorities.A scheme by which the Commissioners can give assistance to-wards the creation of Training Estates in the Special Areas should be worked out.The policy regarding the Coal Mining Industry has been separately considered by the Cabinet (Cabinet 46 (35)).There are objections to the setting up of a Central Bureau of Information, but the possibility of centralising the inform-ation collected by the Development Councils in the Travel and Development Association should be examined.The question of advertising abroad should be discussed with the Travel and Development Association, which already receives a grant for such purposes on the Vote for the Department of Overseas Trade.There are objections to giving the Special Areas a price preference on Government contracts but the practice of giving a preference,  other things being equal,  to firms in the &quot;Scheduled Depressed Areas&quot;,  a larger field than the Special Areas,  should continue.    Sympathetic consideration should, as heretofore, be
given to tenders from the Special Areas without any public statement to this effect being made.Public^ ^orks.Scnemes.to implement the Commissioners&apos;   suggestions as to the formation of a society to provide houses in rural areas where prospects of employment are good, as to a Public Utility Housing Society for the North eastern Area and as to arterial drainage in Scotland should be worked out.The scheme of assisting in the establishment of military camps in the Special Areas should be developed.Agriculture,The Commissioners&apos; schemes for land settlement, which in their view represent all that is immediately practicable, can be accepted as a vmole.Af f o r e s tati on.The Government grant has recently been increased so that the planting programme can be expanded up to about 30,000 acres a year.      A scheme for planting an additional 200,000 acres over a period of ten years which would provide considerable employment and 1,000 forest holdings, is under examination.A Committee (representing the Commissioner, the Forestry Commission, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Labour and the Treasury)  should be set up to prepare a detailed scheme for developing a large area in the Welsh and Northumbrian Hills as large scale experiments in the use of land.Transfer enc e.A progressive policy is necessary.      The fact should be emphasised that facilities for training, reconditioning or transference are available for all suitable persons in the Special Areas.ilivery effort should be made to remove the reluctance of suitable people to transfer from the Special Areas.
&apos; &apos; : 149As to migration,  the possibility of assisting the Child Emigration Society in regard to the Fairbridge Farm School and the question in general should be further examined by the Dominions Office.The Ministry of Labour, which has Statutory powers toprovide hostels or to make grants to voluntary organisations for the purpose,  should consider whether there are cases inwhich it would be qualified in extending the  grants te voluntary-ary organisations for transference purposes up to 100 per cent.B (ii)    Suggestions which seem open to considerable objection or on which difficulties arise.Industry.As to finance for new industries in the Special Areas , the Chancellor of the Exchequer has undertaken to discuss with the Banks the following scheme;- applicationsfor loans for stimu-lating new industries,  etc.  to be received and sifted by Local Development Councils and,  if there is a prima facie case in their favour, passed on to the Commissioner.      If he also thinks well of an application, he should ask the Banks  to go beyond their usual practice in extending credit to it,  the Commissioner to have authority in such cases -to guarantee the first 25 per cent,  of any,loss which might ensue in the long run.The question whether some special organisation to explore and plan industrial development is necessary for Scotland,to be discussed between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Scotland.The effect on industry of the financial position of local authorities in the Special Areas and the desirability or other-wise of further financial assistance from State Funds should be examined by a Committee representing the Treasury, Ministry of Health, Scottish Office and the Unemployment Assistance Board.Public Works.The Government has not been asked by the Commissioner to alter the policy by which grants are restricted to works of definite value either from the economic point  of view or from the point of view of social improvement.    This policy should continue.
There are serious objections to the suggestion that the Commissioners should he empowered to supplement a specific grant offered hy a Government Department and it should not he adopted.As to ..the suggestion that the Commissioners  should he empowered to make a grant where, although a grant is payable by a Government Department it is not in fact paid,  the Commissioners should make recommendations in appropriate cases to the Government Departments concerned that the grant should be paid,  in order to establish the position which would have existed had they been able to make grants themselves.The Commissioners should be authorised to assist certain types of Public Works in the Special Areas to the extent suggested by the Inter-Departmental Committee (see paras. 175-183 of their Report).Certain large Public Works of possible benefit to the Special Areas  (e.g.  the Thames Tunnel,  the Humber, Forth and Severn Bridges and Tyne crossings),  are under examination.Transferenee.There are objections to reverting to the policy of giving a higher rate of grant on condition that a proportion of the labour is drawn from the Special Areas.    A formula is, however, being drawn up to make it clear that the Government expect Iiocal Authorities will themselves play their part in furthering the national policy of transference by engaging labour through the Employment Exchanges and requiring their&apos; contractors to do the same.      When such a formula, has been agreed upon among the Departments concerned,  the Minister of Health should confer with local authority representatives with a view to obtaining a favourable reception for it by local authorities.
Mi sce1laneous.As the Commissioner for ianglarid and Wales is represented in each of his Areas hy an Assistant Commissioner, a decision upon the suggestion that there should he resident  commissioners in each Special area should be postponed., iii)  Suggestipns which seem open.....to serious objection.This section of the Inter-Departmental Committee&apos;s Report deals with the following subjects.:- a licensing system or special taxation to control the location and movement of factories?    shorter hours, assisted by a Government grant to employers;;    later entry into industry combined with a general training to fit boys for practical work and girls for domestic life;    earlier retirement and contributory pensions 5    compulsory holidays with pay    a survey to ascertain derelict areas and differential treatment for the population of them?    and a system, based on that of the King&apos;s Roll for ex-Service men,  to secure employment for youths up to twenty-one from the Special Areas in other parts of the Country,      All these should be ruled out,Suggestions not mentioned in Commissioners&apos; Reports but put forward .111 other j/ays.The question of the location of Government factories isunder separate consideration.      The question of Government ordershas been referred to in para. B(i) above.Industry.The questions of restricting the employment of women, giving grants to firms instituting pensions schemes,  increasing tariffs,  cannot be dealt with as problems affecting the Special Areas only.It is unnecessary in existing circumstances to deal with the suggestions regarding the admission of iron ore miners to coal mining or a coal export agreement with Italy.The complaints as to railway rates and cock dues in South Wales appear not to be justified by the evidence.
In view of the &quot;benefits already enjoyed hy gas driven vehicles, there are no grounds for further action.The experiments with hydrogenation plants are being watched and in view of certain new developments it would be unjustifiable to assist the South hales proposal financially.The Mines Department should further examine, as a matter of urgency, the question of iron ore royalties in order to see whether there is any practicable means of assisting the Vest Cumb er 1 and iron-ore industry.Public Works.The question of the national treatment of main roads and bridges is receiving separate consideration.Measures of Social Improvement.The co-ordination between the National Council of Social Service, the Commissioner and the Ministry of Labour works well and,  in view of the increased work being&apos; undertaken by the Council,  assistance is being given to it with a view to increasing its staff.T r an s f c r e n c e .It would be impossible- to adopt the suggestion to make grants to employers to train workpeople for new industries without paying a subsidy to individual private enterprises.The question of payments to revive apprenticeship is a matter for employers rather than the Government.The question of preparatory training centres,  one of which is being arranged by the Ministry of Labour, has become connected with a suggestion since made by the Commissioner and now under examination,  that compulsory practical and physical training should he provided for all persons in the Special Areas, up to the age of twenty-one.      The suggested medical examination of unemployed juveniles will also come under consideration in this c onhec11on.
1 liecellaneojis .The suggested Regional Development Authority is unnecessary, as the Development Councils are sufficient to perform the functions contemplated.The two existing Physical Training Colleges are sufficient for the present need and the provision of further institutions can he considered if developments require it. committee s s i one rs&apos;  pcwe rs.Neither of the Commissioners suggested the removal of Ministerial control, or of the limitation of grants on wage-paid schemes to those of economic value, or of the restriction preventing grants to industries operating for purposes of gain. These should not be removed.The Commissioners should not be empowered to supplement a grant from another State source.Cases where a grant from State sources is &quot;payable&quot; but not paid should be met in the manner described in Paragraph B(ii) above .It is not desirable to add to the Schedule of Special Areas.The Commissioners&apos;  powers to undertake work outside the Special Areas seem greater than were at first anticipated.      The case of Hostels, which both Commissioners mentioned,  should be dealt with in the manner suggested above in Paragraph B(i).Cases where the Commissioners might - have acted, had their powers extended outside Great Britain (in assisting the Child Emigration Society and in advertising abroad), should be met in the manner indicated above - see Paragraph B(i).
