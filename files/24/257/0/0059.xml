&quot;this wqpssm is the property of rag britannic majesty1^ c^yisioiZNT. 351SE-SJOjT- cabinet. .Q0BLNO&apos; H^L.&apos;c.F.239(35).ti-3E proceedings of the ptteisfational labour organisation IN relation to jPEOJPpSALS. for a 40 hour working week.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Labour.1.     My colleagues will be aware that during recent years proposals for limiting weekly hours of work to 40 by International Convention have been continuously before the International Labour Organisation.     A stage in the proceedings has now been reached when it is incumbent upon H.m. Government to make a further statement of policy in this connection in the form of a reply to questionnaires received from Geneva.2i.    i will not burden this memorandum with a full history of the 40-hour week discussions at Geneva.     i would mention that at the last Conference of the International Labour Organisation (June,. 1935) a draft Convention was adopted in favour of &quot;the principle of a 40-hour week applied in such a manner that the standard of living is not reduced in consequence&quot;.     The Convention was approved by a majority of the Conference but various Governments (including H.m. Government) voted against or abstained from voting, including all the British Commonwealth Governments (except the Irish Free State) and Japan. The Employers with, few exceptions voted in the minority.     The full text of the Convention and the Resolution which accompanied it is given in Appendix A attached but I would call attention at this&apos; point.to that portion of the Convention which lays it down that State Members ratifying it approve &quot;the talcing or facilitating of such measures as should be judged appropriate to secure this end (i.e. the application of the principle of a 40-hour week) and undertakes to apply this principle to classes of employment in accordance with the detailed provisions to be prescribed by such statutory conventions as are ratified by that Member&quot;.       The Convention does not therefore apply the principle of a 40-hour week to any specific field of industry, the idea of its promoters being that successive Conferences would bring an ever-widening circle of industries within the scope of a 40-hour week provision. The 1935 Conference itself considered making a start on the task of bringing
3 5  industries within the ambit of the 40-hour week Convention of Principle and examined the following items in this connection:-(a) Glass bottle manufacture.(b) Public works undertaken or subsidized by Governments.(c) Building and civil engineering.(d) Iron and steel works.(e) Coal mining.A Draft Hours Convention was approved only in respect of the first item, which is not relatively important, and it is worthy of note that, as the process of manufacture of glass bottles is a continuous one, the draft Convention places the weekly number of hours at 42 and not 40.       In the cases of the remaining four items, the draft Conventions prepared in Committee were not adopted by the Conference, but decisions were taken that the International Labour Office should frame questionnaires on these items and send them, together with the relevant draft Conventions, to Governments preparatory to a further consideration at the 1936 Conference.     These questionnaires and draft Conventions have accordingly been transmitted to Governments and a reply to the questionnaires is now due to go to Geneva.3.    Our reply will be published and circulated by Geneva and will form part of the documentary matter which will come before the 1936 Conference.       If circumstances permit, I propose to attend that Conference in order to make a speech supporting and elaborating the policy of the Government as set forth in the reply, and I hope also to use the occasion to direct the attention of the International Labour Organisation   to the desirability of considering internationally the whole of the circumstances of an industry instead of limiting consideration to the hours aspect, which cannot in reality be usefully examined in isolation from the rest of the working conditions in force.4.     While the questionnaires cover a number of points, the primary question relating to each field of industry referred to is in the following form:-&quot;Do you consider it desirable that the International Labour Conference should adopt, in the form of a Draft Convention, international regulations for the reduction of hours of work      (e*g* iron and steel works) in accordance with the principle laid down in the Forty-Hour Week Convention, 1935?&quot;
I do not think it necessary to trouble my colleagues -with the subsidiary questions as the answer to this primary question involves a statement of policy which alone is of importance05.     The short answer to the above question should in my view be in the negative.       As H.M. Government has already indicated, there is no sanctity In the number of hours of work at present in force in any industry and to say &quot;No&quot; to a proposed draft Convention designed to implement the 40-hour Convention of Principle does not mean that a shorter working week cannot suitably be arranged In the particular circumstances of this industry or that.     I have in fact followed the example of my predecessor in consulting employers&apos; and workers&quot; organisations on the subject of increasing emplby-ment, and particularly as to the feasibility of shortening hours of work in their respective industries with this object.     As a result of these contacts I have been reinforced in the view that it would be irrational for BAM. Government to accept the 40-hour Convention of Principle and to support its application to individual industries regardless of the difficulties which emerge from a proper consideration of the circumstances of each of these industries and of the effect on wages.     In many industries hours and wages are governed by joint collective agreements which have been reached by the responsible associations of employers and workers.     I do not think that we can undertake to over-ride and to set them aside in favour of an arbitrary application of a 40-hour week Convention.As to the theory that a compulsory and universal limitation of hours of work to 40 would help the uneirployment situation, there is no evidence to support this.       Indeed a shortage of adqquately skilled workers is becoming more evident as various industries increase in activity.     I need not, however, elaborate this point as it was made in Cabinet Memorandum CP.30/34 submitted in 1934 by the then Minister of Labour, and accepted by the Cabinet at that time.6.     There is one further major point which arises out of the inevitableassociation of wages with hours in contractual engagements between employersand employed.     Those British trade union leaders who have been foremost in pressing for the general application of a 40 Hour Week Convention have seenthat there is a danger of a reduction of hours being accompanied by acorresponding reduction of wages and havB realised that the rank and file of3.
their movement do not regard 40-hour week proposals with any great faith or enthusiasm but are more concerned with the amount of earnings taken home each week.       These trade union leaders, therefore, have sought to establish the position that hours should be reduced to 40 without any loss of earnings. On this point there is a -cleavage of view as between the continental and the British and Dominion trade union leaders - a cleavage which efforts to maintain the international solidarity of the workers have not succeeded in concealing.     Many continental  workers do not hope for a 40-hour week others-wise than on a work sharing and wage sharing basis, but the British workers will have none of this.     In considering the framing of the 40-Hour Week Convention of Principle quoted above, the British workers&apos; representative strove, but without success, to have a clause inserted therein which would safeguard the earnings of the workers.     But, lacking the full support of trade unionists from other countries, the British workers had to be content with the phrase providing &quot;that the standard of living is not reduced&quot;, a phrase which was adopted in an attempt to cover a fundamental difference of view on the subject of wages.   Failing to get what they wanted in the Convention, the British workers supported the passing of a Resolution as follows:-&quot;Resolution on the Maintenance of the Standard of Living of the Workers adopted by the Nineteenth Session of the international Labour Conference.The Conference,Having adopted a Draft Convention declaring its approval of the principle of the forty-hour week,Considering that the application of this principle should not as a consequence reduce the weekly, monthly or yearly income of the workers, whichever may be the customary method of reckoning, nor lower their standard of living,Invites Governments:(l) to take appropriate measures in order to ensure that any adjustment of wages and salaries should be effected as far as possible by means of direct negotiations between employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations&apos;concerned; and(2) after consultation with the organisations of employers and workers concerned, to take or facilitate appropriate measures to enable either of the parties concerned, if agreement between them cannot be reached, to submit the dispute to bodies competent to deal with wage questions, such bodies being set up., where they do not exist, for the purpose;   and(3) to furnish to the International Labour Office periodic reports upon the measures they have taken for the introduction of the forty-hour week and for the maintenance of the standard of living of the workers.&quot;
7.     It is to be noted that the above Resolution has no binding force and is therefore one which would have little or no effect in countries ratifying the Convention.     The position is that the international regulation of wages is not within sight, and in countries where the workers are largely unorganised, wages would fall further on the reduction of hours to 40 than in the case of countries with sfcronger industrial organisations.   Inequality of wage   conditions as between the different countries would therefore be increased as a result of the general acceptance of the 40-hour week, and the result would not be helpful to us as a high wage country with a large export trade to maintain.8.     I have received written and verbal communications from the National Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations and the General Council of the Trade Union Congress on the subject of the proposals.     The Confederation are strongly against any support of the Conventions, and the Trade- Union Congress equally definitely in their favour at any rate as regards Building,Civil Engineering and Iron and Steel Works.     My Department has also secured the views of the various other Government. Departments with an interest in the question of hours of work and wages and I would specially draw the attention of my colleagues to the reply received from the Air Council, a copy of which is attached as Appendix &apos;B? hereto.     This reply is not only cogent in substance but has a special significance in view of the urgency of the aircraft programme.     The replies from other Government Departments also provide evidence as to the inadvisability of proceeding with 40-Hour Conventions.9.     The above considerations apply to oil the questionnaires.     Special points arise with regard to those relating to&apos;Public Works undertaken or subsidised by Governments and Coal Mining.     In the matter of public works there is the additional point that Public Works undertaken or subsidised by Governments do not constitute a separate industry but are a cross-section of many industries. I suggest that it would be wrong to legislate in the matter of hours not on the basis of the nature of an activity, but according to whether or not the activity was directly or indirectly being conducted tinder Government auspices: this is what, in effect, is the proposal, to have an Hours Convention for Public Works undertaken or subsidised by Governments.     I do not think I need labour this point as I find that the General Council of the Trades Union Congress
as well as the employers&apos; organisations uphold me in not regarding Public Works undertaken or subsidised by Governments as an industry to be subjected to hours legislation.With regard to Coal Mining, I do not propose to send a reply to the Questionnaire at present.     The matter is proper for consideration in the first place as between the Minister of Mines and the Coal Mining employers and workers, but in the present circumstances I can well understand that my colleague would not desire to take up with the industry such a controversial question as the regulation of hours.     The wages issue as raised by the mineworkers clearly overshadows any hours question and I feel sure that the Secretary for Mines would agree that the present moment is not opportune either for a discussion on hours of work in coal mines or for making any pronouncement at Geneva on this matter.10.     The above observations are confined to the question of international regulations to reduce weekly hours of work to forty.     This is to be distinguished from national consideration of excessive hours of work and excessive overtime.     These are matters which figure prominently in the discussions with employers and workers organisations which my predecessor initiated and I am continuing,11.      I should be glad to receive the agreement of my colleagues on the attitude I have taken up with regard to Public Works and Coal Mining and I attach in Schedule &quot;C1 a draft reply*to the 40-hour week proposals in relation to Building and Civil Engineering and Iron and Steel Works for the approval of my colleagues.(intd.)

COPY.AIR MINISTRY,Appendix B.LONDON, W.C.2.4-40543/35/:13th November, 1935.Sir,I am commanded by the Air Council to refer to your letter I .L. 184/3/1935 of the 19th August, 1935, forwarding a copy of the questionnaire circulated by the International Labour Office on the subject of the reduction of the hours of work in public works undertaken or subsidised by governments, and to your further letter I.L. 184/5/1935 dated August, 1955, forwarding a similar questionnaire relating to the building and civil engineering industry,  and to state that the matter has received consideration.2.      It is understood that the above industries have been selected, in preference to industries producing for export, for special consideration in connection with the suggested introduction of the 40 hour week because the export trades, if they adopted the 40 hour week, would be heavily handicapped in competing with industrial concerns domiciled in countries not subscribing to the convention or in countries which, while subscribing to the convention, could not be relied upon to ensure that its provisions were strictly enforced. 3.     The force of these considerations is recognised, but as against them must be set the fact that the application of the 40 hour week, without disturbance of weekly earnings, to public works and building and civil engineering would hive the unfortunate effect of still further widening the discrepancy between the working conditions of the persons employed in industries subject to foreign &quot;competition and of those employed in the sheltered industries.      The latter are already in an unduly favourable position as compared with the former.     This is a general consideration which the Council feel bound to mention in view of the anomalies which at present exist as regards wage levels in this country, which anomalies would undoubtedly be accentuated by the introduction of a working week of 40 hours in the sheltered industries.      It is desirable that such influence as the Government can exert should be in the direction of improving the wages and conditions in the unsheltered, rather than in the sheltered, industries.      The difficulty of doing anything on those lines would, however, be increased by prescribinga 40 hour week for some of the sheltered industries.The Secretary,Ministry or Labour, M ont agu Hou se,Whitehall,  S.W.1.
4.      On general grounds, therefore, the Council would deprecate the application of a 40 hour week to the building and civil engineering industry or to public works;   but from the point of view also of their own special needs they would even more strongly deprecate the adoption of the shorter working week in these industries at the present time, -when every effort is being made to expand the Royal Air Force as rapidly as possible and much work is in progress in connection with the rapid development of civil aviation.     The main objects of the introduction of a shorter working week care -(a) the spreading of employment over a larger number of persons and the consequent absorption of the unemployed:    and(b) the provision of increased leisure for the industrial worker. Neither of these objects would be served by the adoption of the 40 hour week in the building and civil engineering industries at the present time.     The carrying out of the works which are required in connection with the expansion of the Royal Air Force has already been delayed by the shortage of skilled building trade craftsmen, and is likely to be still further delayed as time goes on.     For this reason the Council have raised with your department the question of increasing the number of men to be trained in building trade crafts at the Ministry of Labour training centres.      It has not, however, so far been found possible to increase the number of trainees.     A reduction in the working week would therefore not enable the number of men employed on Ait? Ministry works to be appreciably increased, nor would it increase the leisure of the workers unless the reduction in the length of the working week were accompanied by a corresponding lengthening of the time allowed for the completion of the works. As it is urgently necessary to complete the expansion of the Royal Air Force as soon as possible, it is not practicable to contemplate the lengthening of the time allowed for the completion of the works.     The workpeople would accordingly have to continue to work the same hours as before, but would receive much higher wages for doing so, with the result that the cost of the works would be greatly increased.5.     The Council consider therefore that their reply to the first question in both questionnaires must be in the negative, and that, this being so, it is unnecessary to give detailed answers to the remaining questions.6.      It is observed that question 6 of the public works questionnaire askswhether works carried out in time of peace for purposes of national defence, work10.
on supplies of all kinds for purposes of national defence, and work on supplies for government departments, should he excluded from the operation of any convention which may ho agreed upon for the reduction of working hours.     As to this I am to state that the Council consider that it would, bo unwise for the British Government to subscribe to any convention which did not clearly provide for the fullest freedom to be reserved to governments both in peace and in war in all matters which in airy way concerned national safety.      The difficulty which this department is at present experiencing because of the shortage of skilled tradesmen in the building industry may be taken as typical of the sort of difficulties which are liable to arise even in peace time, and these difficulties would, of course, be accentuated by the introduction of a 40 hour week.     Moreover it. would not bo practicable to overcome the difficulties by the working of overtime if the latter were to be subject to severe limitations.7.      The Air Council would therefore strongly urge that no steps should be taken for the present to subscribe to a convention providing for the application of a 40 hour week in the building and civil engineering industry or on public works.I ana, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed) J. A. Webster.
/xE2?nC.DPdJTT REPLY TO QUESTIONNAIRES RELATING TO IRON AND STEEL TORKS AND TO THE BUILDING- AMD CIVIL El^JjgiESING nTDUSTRY,,The first and fundamental question in. each of these questionnaires is whether His Majesty&apos;s Government consider it desirable that the International Labour Conference should adopt, in the form of a Draft Convention, international regulations for the reduction of hours of work in the industry in question in accordance with the principle laid down in the Forty-Hour Week Convention, 1935.        Consideration of this question involves a careful examination of the terms of the 1935 Convention and on this and cognate matters His Majesty&apos;s Government make   the following ob se rvati ons:-(a) The Forty-Hour Week Convention, 1935, approves &quot;the principle of a forty-hour week applied in such a manner that the standard of living is not reduced in consequence&quot;.     His Majesty&apos;s Government regard this provision as lacking in precision and outside the possibility of legal enforcement so that the Convention provides no real safeguard of the standard of life of the workers.(b) The 1935 International Labour Conference, having adopted the Forty-Hour Week Convention, passed a Resolution in which the view is expressed that the application of the principle of the forty-hour week &quot;should not as a consequence reduce the weekly, monthly or yearly income of the workers, whichever may be the customary method of reckoning, nor lower theiz- standard of living&quot;.     The inference from the words quoted is that the Convention itself does not provide any safeguard against the reduction of the earnings of the workers consequent upon the reduction of hours and that some further action was
required to cover this point.     The Resolution howover, which is apparently designed to moot this difficulty, imposes no binding obligation on Governments and His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore take the view that neither in the 19&amp;5 Convention nor in the Resolution is there any provision which secures the maintenance of earnings as an essential condition of the reduction of hours.(c)    In directxng specxal attention to the question of the maintenance of earnings His Majesty&apos;s Government take note of tire view expressed in the course of the International Labour&quot; Conference of 1935 by representatives of the General Council of the Trades Union Congress in favour of the reduction of weekly hours of work to forty on the understanding that there is such adjustment of wages as will secure to the workers no less income per week than was received by them prior to the hours being reduced,Having regard to tk&amp;aa? considerations His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s answer to the first question in these questionnaires must be in the negative and consequently the remaining questions do not call for reply.
