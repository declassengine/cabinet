THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1935.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 188 (35).CABINET.ITALIAN-ABYSSINIAN QUESTION.Supply of Commodities to Italian Colonies in East Africa.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.WITH reference to CP. 186 (35), I desire to invite the attention of my colleagues to a question mentioned in the first sentence of Section 6 of the Report circulated with that paper, but not discussed there namely, whether, if it is decided to impose certain financial and economic sanctions on Italy under Article 16 of the Covenant, there should be included among such sanctions measures to restrict or prohibit the direct supply of commodities by States Members of the League to the Italian Colonies in East Africa. I have in mind commodities (such as food-stuffs) the export of which to Italy itself would not be restricted or prohibited under the sanctions contemplated, but which are being-imported into the Italian Colonies in East Africa in abnormal quantities chiefly for the support of the Italian armies engaged there.2. I have not at the moment information which enables me to give precise details of this particular trade. Apart from enormously increased direct imports from Italy, the supplies obtained for Eritrea and Italian Somaliland are apparently chiefly drawn from Egypt, India (usualry via Mombasa), the Union of South Africa and from neighbouring territories under British control, principally the Sudan, Kenya, Aden, Cyprus and Tanganyika. So far as the Colonial Dependencies are concerned, purchases cover a fairly wide range : Mules, wine and lemons from Cyprus; water and ice from Aden; cattle, fodder, maize, wheat flour, potatoes and coffee from Kenya; while considerable quantities of goods (e.g., textiles, light railway material, galvanized iron, tyres and tubes, and wheat (from India)) are trans-shipped at Mombasa or Zanzibar for the Italian Colonies, or are bought out of local imported stocks.3. It is possible that this trade might fall away to some extent under war conditions; but the question arises whether a state of affairs would be defensible under which, while certain measures are being taken against Italy with the object of hampering her prosecution of a war with Abyssinia, no check is made on the direct supply to the Italian Colonies of commodities which while not technically war material are nevertheless largely imported for the direct maintenance of the Italian armies in the field against Abyssinia.4. This question does not affect the Colonial Dependencies alone : and any action that might be taken in regard to the direct trade with the Italian Colonies in East Africa would have to be taken by all States Members of the League, co-operating in the application of sanctions against Italy. But, in fact, the territories chiefly affected would (apart from Egypt) be those under British control. The position as regards Egypt and the Sudan might give rise to considerable difficulty, but the decision as to their participation in the particular measures discussed in this memorandum would depend on the decision as to their participation generally in sanctions against Italy.[12197]
5. If it were decided, in consultation with the other States Members of the League concerned, to take special action in regard to the direct supply of commodities to the Italian Colonies in East Africa, it would presumably be necessary to prohibit all direct trade with these Colonies (subject to the possible modification suggested in paragraph ), since it would be impossible in practice to distinguish between goods consigned to those Colonies for the use of the Italian military forces there, and those purchased for other uses. While it is probable that these supplies do not form any large proportion of those on which the Italian forces are dependent and while it would no doubt be possible for the Italian authorities to circumvent such a general prohibition, given time, anything approaching the virtual cessation for a period of direct trade between States Members of the League and the Colonies concerned would undoubtedly incon-venience greatly the conduct of the Abyssinian campaign, and action taken to this end would obviate criticism to the effect that, while endeavouring in other directions to hamper the Italian military operations, we were giving direct aid to the Italian troops waging their campaign.6. On the other hand, it might conceivably be urged that to withhold the supply of food-stuffs and water from the population and forces in the Colonies concerned would be an act of inhumanity. If it were thought that there was force in this view, it might be possible to make a distinction between (i) the supply of food-stuffs and water, for human beings and animals, which would be allowed, and (ii) the supply of all other commodities, which would be prohibited.(Initialled) M.
