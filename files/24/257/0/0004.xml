THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1935.MOST SECRET. Copy No.   45CP. 184 (35).CABINET.ATLANTIC AIR ROUTE.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.1. THE Secretary of State for Air in CP. 164 (35) advocates the immediate initiation of steps for the establishment of a Trans-Atlantic air service linking up this country with Canada and the United States, a course which has been recommended to him by the inter-Departmental Committee on International Air Communications under Sir Warren Fisher.2. It would, perhaps, have been appropriate in any case that as one who was so recently responsible for the initiation and administration of Air policy, I should record my entire agreement with the broad outline of a Trans-Atlantic Air policy of this kind, but I should not have felt it necessary to trouble my colleagues with a paper on the subject, had the Secretary of State not thought it advisable to issue OP. 182 (35) in support of his proposals.3. While, as I have stated above, I am able to give my full support to the prosecution of the policy advocated in CP. 164 (35) in broad outline, I am unable to agree with the particular steps which the Secretary of State recommends in (2) and (3) of paragraph 14 of the Cabinet Paper ibo which I have referred (CP. 164 (35)), i.e. .-&apos;&apos; (2) The negotiations with the Irish Free State Government should be pressed forward.(3) That financial assistance, in a form to be decided later, towards the provision of a base in the Irish Free State should be given.&quot;4. In support of these proposals the Secretary of State has just circulated (CP. 182 (35)) the report of a committee on Trans-Atlantic air services set up in August 1932 at the time of the Ottawa Conference at the request of the Canadian Government upon which the United Kingdom was represented by the Director General of Civil Aviation. That report recommended (inter alia) the acceptance by the Governments concerned, i.e., the United Kingdom, the Irish Free State, Newfoundland and Canada, of an agreement that (1) they should give every possible preference to the route United Kingdom-Irish Free State-Newfoundland-Canada;  and(2) they should not actively support any other route, or give privileges to any foreign Government or its nationals, or allow the establishment of air bases, in connection with such services without prior full consultation with, the co-signatory Governments.5.   There are three points which I have to make regarding the report of this committee :  (1) It was never ratified as part of the general body of the agreements of the Ottawa Conference :[12163]J
(2) It has, so far as I am aware, never been ratified subsequently as a separate agreement by the Governments concerned :(3) Far from this report having been accepted and acted upon  IS  b gentlemen&apos;s agreement,&quot; it has really never arisen for consideration until the present occasion, but has remained in a state, of suspended animation pending the initiation on the part of the Canadian Government which was responsible for the setting up of the committee of action for its endorsement by the Governments concerned.Whatever its relevance, therefore, to the present discussion, I certainly object to this document being put forward with any suggestion that it constitutes a binding agreement which fetters our discretion or limits the area of our present choice.6. Paragraph 8 of CP. 164 (35) admits that a terminal base in Northern Ireland is an alternative to a base in the Irish Free State and that no survey has yet been undertaken to decide which is the more suitable location from the technical point of view- It allows, further, that a base,in Northern Ireland would have the advantage of being under our complete control In spite of this and without any evidence of the results of a technical survey, the inter-Departmental Committee recommend the establishment of the base in the Irish Free State rather than in Northern Ireland in order to avoid the possibility of international competition which they fear.will exist if the Irish Free State were to be left as an open door.7; Upoii this issue I direct the particular attention of my colleagues to paragraph 7 of the report of the Director-General of Civil Aviation of his discussions with the Minister of Industry and Commerce in the Irish Free State at Dublin, which is appended to CP. 164 (35). From this it appears that the Irish Free State are willing to co-operate and to give their guarantee (for whatT ever such a guarantee can be fairly regarded as worth.) against international competition upon two main conditions (1) That they should retain the ownership Of the base, complete with all installations.(2) That they should not be asked to contribute to developing the base, which might cost anything up to  1 million, or to contribute tb a subsidy for operation.8. The Secretary of State endorses the view of the inter-Departmental Committee, and in so doing I presume accepts these preliminaries as an indication that there exists a satisfactory basis for negotiation.9. I regret to have to record my profound disagreement with this part of his proposals, for the following reasons :  (1) Northern Ireland should for every reason of public policy be preferred to the Irish Free State, provided that a survey results in a favourable report on its technical suitability.(2) The. people, of Northern Ireland deserve the preference and support of the people and Government of this country. Northern Ireland is part pf the United Kingdom, and its people are suffering severely from the depression in their two principal industries of shipbuilding and linen manufacture. The establishment of a permanent air base there, if technically possible, would give direct relief to unemployment in Northern Ireland and so would indirectly also relieve the British exchequer. ,(3) We cannot afford, either financially or politically, to give any further hostage to fortune such as our Trans-Atlantic air base to the Goverh-meht and people of the Irish Free State.(4) To make a present to the Irish Free State of our Trans-Atlantic air base would be a complete reversal of the Irish Policy which we have

It would be to reward the repudia-tion of one agreement by the gift of another. (5) The &quot; open door,&quot; if our base is not to be in the Irish Free State, is really not a risk worth considering, since, as it appears, it would cost a million pounds to the foreigner to enter by it. ..-V.3 : .&apos; ,-;       L.
