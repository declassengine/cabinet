COPY NO.    ^5&quot;*,P, 194   (55)CABIN E TGOVERNMENT BUSINESS DURING THE GENERAL ELECTIONSNote by the Secretary.1. It has been customary since the War for successive governments to provide emergency arrangements during the period of a General Election,  and to set up for the purpose a Cabinet Committee with the title of the Emergency Business Committee.2. This was done by the Conservative Government inDecember, 1923, by the Labour Government in October, 1924, by the Conservative Government in May, 1929, and by the National Government in October, 1931.3&apos;. The Committees have dealt with urgent matters of alldescriptions which have arisen during the Elections,  but  their main purpose has been to settle the answers  to be given by Parliamentary candidates supporting the Government to question-&quot; naires put to those candidates by various Organisations.4. The arrangements made on each occasion have been sub-stantially the same,    &apos; Those made in 1931 may be briefly summarised as follows:On 6th October,  1931 (Cabinet 71 (31), Conclusion.6)  the Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary (CP.262 (31)) outlining the procedure adopted during the last three General Elections for the transaction of Government business during the period of the Election,  and agreed :--1-
&quot;(a) That a Committee composed of -The prime Minister (for major questions only),The Lord Chancellor,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,The Secretary of State for India,The President of the Board of Trade,together with any other members ^f the Cahinet who might he available,  and other Ministers according to the nature of the business, with a representative of the Treasury in attendance -should form a nucleus(i)  for handling Cabinet business during the Election,  including questions of principle submitted by candidates to the Party Organisations(ii) -&quot;to make such arrangements as it might think best for establishing liaison with the Party Organisations concerned;(iii)  to deal with ordinary Cabinet business during the Election, unless it is of such importance as to render necessary the summoning of the full Cabinet.(d) That no attempt should be made toarrange with the Opposition Party for the reduction In the number of questionnaires to be answered by candidates.&quot;5. It was also decided that the arrangements for dealing in1931 with the questionnaires should follow as closely&apos;as possible the arrangements in operation at the time of the General Election in 1929. A small Committeerepresentative of the Party Organisations supporting the Govern-ment was set up.      This Committee prepared draft replies to questionnaires and submitted these replies,  together with the questionnaires,  to  the Cabinet Offices.      The observations of the Departments concerned were  then obtained,and the question-naires,   together with the replies suggested by the Party Organisations and the Departments, were submitted to the Cabinet Committee.6. The Secretariat of the Cabinet Committee was supplied bythe Cabinet Offices, and the Committee&apos;s conclusions were circulated to the Cabinet for information, but the actual
, 88communication of the Committee1s  decisions to the various candidates and their interested Parties was carried out &quot;by the Party Organisations, with which close liaison was maintained,7. Prior to the General Election of 1929,  an agreement was made between the principal Agents ef the three Parties that candidates  should be instructed not to reply to questionnaires from Organisations outside their constituencies-uencies.      It was hoped by this means to effect a sub-stantial reduction in the number of questions asked.      This hope, however, was disappointed, arid the experiment was not repeated in 1931.80 If it is decided on the present occasion to followprevious precedents,  decisions on the lines of those of 1931 set out in para. 4 above will be required.      In particular the nucleus composition of the Cabinet Committee will have to be determined.(S i signed)    M.P.A,  HANKEY,Secretary to the Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.19th October,  1935,
