miS D0 CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT ) . SECRET.CP.223(35) COPY NO. jjjjjgCABINET.GRANTS TO PUBLIC ASSISTANCE AUTHORITIES. Memorandum by the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland.1,      When the Second Appointed Bay under the Unemployment Act,  1934,   originally fixed for 1st March,   1935,  was postponed, the Government agreed that during the period of postponement : public assistance authorities should receive grants from the Exchequer to put them as nearly as may be in the financial position they would have occupied had there been no postponement.    The Unomp.1 oyment Assistance   (Temporary Provisions) (No.2) Act,  1935,  authorised grants for this purpose up to 30th September,   1935.2.      The Second    Appointed Day still stands postponed and cannot be fixed until the Government have considered the future arrangements for unemployment assistance.    Meanwhile public assistance  authorities continue to meet the cost of relief to those of the able-bodied unemployed who are on public assistance,  but have not received grants from the Exchequer in this regard for any period subsequent to 30th September.3.      The natural vehicle for dealing finally with these grants will be the legislation necessary to give effect to the Government&apos;s decisions on unemployment  assistance.    The date of presentation and passing of that legislation cannot however he foreseen with certainty at present and it would be unfair to expect local authorities to await recoupment of their expenditure until an uncertain future date.
4.      It is therefore proposed,   as an interim measure,  to introduce legislation to authorise a continuance of grants on the present basis for a further period of six months.    It is desirable that the Bill should pass through all its stages before Christmas.5.      A draft of the necessary Bill,  which it will be seen is extremely simple,  is attached and we should be glad to have the  authority of our colleagues to proceed on the lines indicated above.    As there is,  we understand,   to be no meeting of the Home Affairs Committee before the date on which the money resolution on which the Bill will be founded should be introduced, we ask that in the circumstances the Cabinet should authorise the Bill without reference to that Committee.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer agrees.(Intld) K.W. (Intld) G.P.G.30th November,  1935.
