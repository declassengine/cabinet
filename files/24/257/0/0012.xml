(THIS DOCuiviiiNT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYEREMEHT) .COPY BO........SECRETCP- 192(35) .CAB I HE T. INDIA.Appreciation of the Political Situation., by the Government of India5  dated 15th. October,  1935.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the secrete.ry of State for India.
Confidential Appreciation of the Political Situation in India, dated the 15th October, 1935,  issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for india the chief interest of the past month has been the Session of the Central Legislature, which lasted from the End to the 28th September.      The Session was marked by some very lively passages in the Legislative Assembly between the Government and Congress party, particularly in the debate on two Bills to amend the Criminal Law. By one of these Bills the Government sought to retain permanently certain powers which they obtained in 1932 for a period of 3 years, and by the other the opposition sought to repeal an Act which certain provisions of the Government Bill made more stringent.    The Government Bill made picketing a penal offence and enabled the Government to seize property and funds of associations declared unlawful and to maintain some control over thepress by means of demands, and forfeiture in certain specified circumstances,  of cash security from owners of presses and publishers of newspapers.    Government held that the provisions of the Bill, though drastic, were essential to hold in check the spread of terrorism, couirnunism and communal hatred and any recurrence of civil disobedience, as the ordinary law had been proved by experience to be insufficient.      After a six days debate the Assembly rejected the motion that the Bill be taken into consideration.      The opposition denied that communism is e, serious danger out made little attempt to deny the dangers of terrorism and communal hatred and no attempt to deny the possibility of the recurrence of civil disobedience.    They admitted the existence of a section of the press which is wholly irresponsible and unscrupulous
i iand which exists only for personal gains.They opposed the Bill mainly on the grounds that it conferred undue powers on the executive, particularly over the Press and that the ordinary lay/ was sufficient. There is, however, no doubt that the Congress Party were influenced by the fact that it was the provisions of this Bill which had been largely responsible for the collapse of the civil disobedience movement.    After the rejection., of the motion for consideration,  the Governors-General returned the Bill to the Assembly in a recommended form. The Assembly again rejected it, but the Council of State passed by 35 votes to 10 the motion that the Bill be taken into consideration,  and accepted without a division motion that the Bill be passed.    As a protest against the passage of the Bill a large number of (? Nationalist) newspapers withheld publication for.one day on September 27th.    Having rejected the Government Bill, the Assembly passed by a. small majority a motion that a non-official Bill to repeal the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1908 be taken into consideration.Assembly rejected by a majority of 4 votes a non-official resolution moved by the Congress Party recommending the appointment of a committee to enquire into the handling&apos; of the rescue, relief and salvage operations resulting from the Quetta earthquake.Government regarded this resolution as a scandalous attempt by Congress to exploit, for political purposes, one of the most appalling disasters in the history of India.    Its genesis is to be found in the refusal of the Government to allow Mr. Gandhi and Congress relief parties to enter Quetta, which refusal was based on the grounds that these parties could not have reached Quetta
78in time to save any lives and. that,  once the need for rescue operations had ceased,  it was essential in the interest of public health and safety to evacuate the civil population as rapidly as possible.The opposition showed a much more accommodating spirit in regard to matters which did not raise acute political issues.    They accepted several small but useful bills and also all demands xor supplementary grants.    A difficult and controversial bill to amend the Cantonment Act was also dealt with in a reasonable wajr.    At the close of the session,  Government gave special facilities for the introduction of several bills relating to social customs.In the Council of State, His Excellency the Commander -in-Chief made an important speech in which he pointed out that any increase in the present rate of Ln&amp;ianisatioii of the commissioned ranks of the Indian Army was impossible unless better material was forthcoming.    He regretted the lack of candidates from among the sons of noble families and Sardars and observed that the quality of candidates was de t er i or at ing.His Excellency the Viceroy addressed both Houses of the Legislature on the 16th September in a speech in which he dealt with a wide variety of subjects of current interest.    Referring to the new Government of India Act he said &quot;The Act,  for the first time in the history of India, consolidates the whole of India,  States and British, for the purposes of common concern under a single government&quot;, and that in future &quot;the Government of India will draw their authority by direct devolution from the Crown just as the Dominion Governments do.    They will cease to be agents, and will stand forth as full political
73A marid juristic personalities exercising the functions of Ris Majesty&quot;.2.       The Lahore mosque dispute continues to provoke controversy in the Punjab.    The internment of the more dangerous advocates of civil disobedience by Muslims had excellent results,  and the situation was further improved by a statement made by the1&apos;-4 die tat or that he had no intention of resorting to civil disobedience but would try to secure the restoration of the mosque by lawful means.Exit a new and unfortunate development has been the promotion&apos; of an economic campaign.    This began by the dictator urging the Muslims to buy only from Muslims.    It has naturally led to counter-action by Hindus and Sikhs, with the result that the communal aspect of the dispute is at the moment more prominent than its anti-government aspect, and communal tension is still acute.    September 20th was celebrated as &quot;Shahidganj Day&quot; throughout the Punjab, and also in many places in other provinces, particularly&apos; the United Provinces and North-West Frontier Province.      But there is clear evidence that,  although Muslims outside the Punjab do feel keenly the demolition of the mosque, they have no desire to be implicated in any serious anti-government or communal agitation.    It is significant that the dictator himself was shouted down in Delhi when he attempted to address a meeting of Muslims. Unfortunately no solution of. this dispute is yet in sight. His Excellency the viceroy, accompanied by His Excellency the Governor of the Punjab and!, the Home Member of the* See the fourth sub-paragraph of paragraph 2 of the last Appreciation, dated 16th September,  1935.
Government of India, discussed the whole situation with a number of Muslim members of the Central Legislature when His Excellency the Governor gave some salutary advice regarding the lines along which a settlement of the trouble might be sought.He explained that so long as Muslims continue to agitate, the Government cannot relax their precautions and the Sikhs are not likely to agree to negotiate. If the Muslim agitation were completelj?&apos; stopped and recourse had to Civil Courts, the Government would be ready to release internees and cancel their action against newspapers, and Sikhs might be induced to negotiate.      A difficulty that may keep the Sikhs from negotiating for some little time is the approach of elections to an important Sikh. Committee in which each candidates chances of success will be proportionate to his professions of belief in the extreme Sikh position.3.      There has been little political activity in the country generally.    Mr. Gandhi remains at War&amp;ha, where lie has been receiving visits from important political leaders an   has been interesting himself in the question of who is to be the next President of Congress.At present it seems likely that this post will fall to Pandit Jawahar Lai Nehru, who was recently released from jail before the expiry of his sentence to enable him to be with his wife, who is seriously ill in Europe.    But Nehru&apos;s acceptance of office will depend largely on the condition of his wife is health.    The All-India Congress Committee meets in Madras this month;  and the  question of acceptance of office  in the provincial Governments by members of the Congress Party will again come up at the meetings, though a decision is likely to be postponed until
Congress itself meets at Lucknow in February. 4.      The Italo-Abyssinian affair occupies much space in the Indian press.      Sympathy is altogether on the side of Abyssinia.      The more moderate papers approve of the attitude of the British Government but some e xtreme papers have been indulging in crJLticism and imputing unworthy motives with the object of making&apos;&apos;political capital.
