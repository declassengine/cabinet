THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOYERNMJ3NPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1935.SECRET Copy No.CP. 198 (35).CABINET.PROGRAMME OF NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR 1935.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.MY colleagues will remember that after the Programme of New Construction for 1935 had been approved by the Cabinet, I proposed, for reasons which were advanced in CP. 42 (35), to substitute for the usual Flotilla of a Leader and eight Destroyers (estimated cost  3,250,000), which had been included therein, a Flotilla of seven Leaders (estimated cost  3,360,000).2. On the 27th February last (Cabinet 12 (35), Conclusion 8), it was agreed to leave the question to myself and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and on the 1st March the Chancellor of the Exchequer informed me that he raised no objection to my proposal.3. I intended to take an opportunity of announcing the change thus approved in the House of Commons later in the year, before the orders were placed.4. Anxious consideration of our requirements in the light of all that has since happened has now convinced me that we ought to include both Flotillas in our 1935 Programme.5. As my colleagues are aware, the replacement destroyer tonnage which we have laid down during the period of the London Naval Treat)&apos;&apos; has been far below that which the Treaty allowed. The main reason for this has been the need for economy, combined with the desirability of adhering to a steady building pro-gramme, but we have been subjected to much criticism for not having replaced our old destroyer tonnage at a greater rate.6. I feel certain that on making the necessary statement in the House of Commons in regard to the alteration approved last March I should in present circumstances be faced with widespread demands for the inclusion of both Flotillas, and I should much prefer to anticipate such demands than seem merely to yield to them. Hence my present proposal, in which the Chancellor of the Exchequer concurs, and which I hope that the Cabinet will approve.7. If this proposal is adopted, I need hardly say that neither the total tonnage in Leaders and Destroyers respectively, which we are allowed by Treaty, nor the permitted replacement tonnage, will be thereby exceeded. My colleagues will remember that we have available for Leaders and Destroyers in the 1935 and 1936 Programmes a total of about 51,000 tons. Of this, the two Flotillas to be laid down in 1935 will absorb about 25,310 tons only a little more than half the total available for the two years.8. From a financial point of view my proposal can, I suggest, be regarded as bringing forward the construction of a Flotilla which would normally have been laid down in a later year possibly in 1937.[12245]
9. I hope very much that if it is approved it will be possible to give the Tyne its fair share of the work.10- The Chancellor of the Exchequer has suggested, and I entirely agree, that it would be very undesirable to make any announcement on the subject during the life of the present Parliament. There will be ample time, before the ships will be laid down, to obtain the necessary Parliamentary authority from the new Parliament when it assembles. The proposal could then be announced as a part or a first instalment of the Governments general defence programme.B. E. M.A dmiralty, S. W. 1,October 17, 1935.
