Q 5* q ti &amp; tsTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. SECRET. COPY NO.     49CPo  256(55)CABINET. OIL SUPPLIES FOR ITALY. Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.In accordance with the decision of the Cabinet /Cabinet 50 (35), Conclusion 2(gjJ7 I saw the representatives of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the Shell Group on the 3rd December, when they   promised to supply me with a memorandum^ copy of which is annexed /Annex I/7.The memorandum makes it clear that the companies do not consider that a voluntary limitation of shipments to Italy could be effected.      It also makes it clear that, in the view of the companies,  they would incur not only   odium, but real risks in Italy if by their own voluntary action they endeavoured to restrict shipments.      The total of the investments of the companies in Italy ( 10 million) is a measure of the risks they run, and I do not see how, in view of their obvious obligations to their shareholders, they could run any risk of reprisals, unless in obedience to direct Government instructions.      In fact, in the light of what &apos; they say I think it would be most difficult to carry further a proposal for voluntary limitation of oil exports.The oil Company&apos;s memorandum also throws up the question of the prohibition of the use of oil tankers for carrying oil to Italy.      I do not regard this as a practicable proposal because of the many possibilities of evasion, if for no other reason.I also circulate a memorandum by the Petroleum Department of the Board of Trade bringing up-to-date the information in Annex 1 to CP.  212 (35) /Annex IjJ7.W.R.Board of Trade,9th December,-1935.
3C*  * I 9ANNEX I.MEMORANDUM BY THE OIL COMPANIES. OIL SANCTIONS AND ITALY.The Petroleum Companies have been asked to considerthe effect generally, and upon them in particular, of(l) petroleum sanctions against Italy complied with by all members of the League,(2) Partial petroleum sanctions against Italy to the extent of members of the League and the United States limiting shipments to normal imports based upon,  say,  1934 imports.Attached hereto, marked &quot;Exhibit A&quot;, is a statement of petroleum imports into Italy during 1934 by products and countries of origin.A similar statement for the Italian Colonies is attached marked &quot;Exhibit B&quot;.These statements show the division of imports over the various producing countries during what might be termed a normal year,  and the following tables provide a comparison with the period August/15th  November, 1935.1934.Roumania..... 31.7$Russia....... 28.9$Venezuela .... 14.8$Iran......... 11.0$U.S.A........ 6.4%Others....... .7,2$Aug./15th Nov. ,   1955. 59. 1$ 10. 0$ 12.4$3. 2$8. 5$6.8$100$100$
Similar figures for the Italian Red Sea Colonies are as follows:-1954. Aug./15th Nov.   1955.Roumania......          - 14.6$Russia ........ 24.5$ 5.9$Venezuela ......I ran/Ne th. Indie s 41.4$ 16. 7$U.S.A.........          7.8$ 26.9$Others ........ 26.3$ 35.9$100$ 100$These figures indicate that already a definite chan^ in the flow of petroleum products to Italy and its&apos; Colonies has taken plaee and it is evident from incomplete figures available up to a later date that this change has become even more pronounced.It is obvious also that a very important, in fact the most important, producing country in the world is not a member of the League, viz.   the U.3.A.      without the co-operation of that country petroleum sanctions would certainly fail.      An attem.pt has been made to ascertain, in the absence of Governmental regulations,  the extent to which U.8.A. producers would be found ready to co-operate in enforcing League decisions.      The production of the U.S.A.  is equal to 400,000 tons of crude daily.      It is impossible to predict exactly to what extent this production is controlled by those sympathetically inclined towards the views already expressed by Washington, but it may be accepted on good authority that practically all the major companies, whilst not being willing to refrain
altogether from exports to Italy, will at least he ready to restrict shipments to their normal quantities. However,  outside of the crude oil produced or controlled &quot;by these major interests there remains a very large quantity, upwards of 80,000 tons daily,  controlled hy so-called independents, active and politically important, who have never regarded Government warnings of any kind and who could prohahly not he induced to adhere to any voluntary plan.      A large part,  if not the whole of this quantity, would he available for movement to Italy.The normal requirements of Italy are about 8,000 tons daily, so that even if Roumanian and Russian imports were to cease and allowing for a large increase in Italian requirements it is clear that without enforced restriction in the U.S.A.  ample free supplies would remain available to meet any Italian requirement.Of the remaining producing countries Iran is controlled entirely by a British company, Venezuela as to 46% by British/Dutch interests and as to 60% by iriendly U.S.A. Groups who will at least restrict their shipments to normal.     There are no other serious factors involving imports into Italy except Roumania and Russia, both of whom,  as the figures indicate, have always supplied large qxiantities to Italy and who control also substantial additional quantities now being shipped elsewhere but which could be directed to Italy if conditions were made sufficiently   attractive.The question has been asked whether, so far as the
(J n* WBritish Oil Companies are concerned,  it would he feasible for them to put into effect voluntary sanctions without the necessity of enforcement by Government regulation.      It is felt that such a development would be unwise,  because it would easily become known that British interests,   of their own volition, refused to supply and all the odium of such a move would fall on their shoulders.      Their properties in Italy would certainly be seised and used for the storage and handling of products from the United States of America or elsewhere.      Their voluntary action would lead to lasting enmity and ill-feeling against British trade,  loss of immense capital investments,  and little if any embarrassment to Italy, because Italy could still secure supplies and the organisation would remain available for handling these supplies.      This organisation is not one that can be closed down:    it consists of many ocean installations and internal bulk depots,   as well as service stations and other distributing centres.      The investment of the Shell.Group in Italy, including stocks,  is about  10,000,000 whereas the Anglo-Iranian, who market their supplies largely through this organisation,  have separate investments amounting to  150,000. For these reasons if sanctions in any form are found to be desirable it is sincerely hoped that they will be put into effect by means of Government regulations.The key to the whole situation is undoubtedly in Washington, but in  addition there remain Roumania and Russia, and a very strict enforcement of sanctions in these two countries would be equally important seeing that each has substantial quantities always available for export.
A partial application by Uniting shipments by all League members and. the United States of America to normal requirements might be embarrassing to Italy,  but probably not very effective.      Large quantities of crude and products are now being shipped from California to&apos; Japan and Manchuria. It must be considered whether the United States of America is likely to limit shipments to these countries in any degree;    without such limitation ample supplies could be shipped to Italy via Japan.      Already Japanese interests have made enquiries for shipment of oil products to Port Said for orders.It would certainly appear&apos; that by the restriction in the use of petroleum for civil purposes,  the admixture of alcohol and locally produced fuels,  Italy could help herself very materially,  and,  although probably be considerably embarrassed, would hardly be crippled by only a partial application of sanctions.Here again therefore the key seems to lie in Washington.Failing the adherence of the United States of America, it has been considered whether the advantages of complete sanctions could not be secured by a prohibition against using the tanker fleets sailing under the flags of the members of the League for supplying Italy and/or her Colonies.      The world tanker fleet is to-day under the following flags:-

It should be considered therefore whether this is a practical proposal.Failing the latter proposal proving practicable, the truth seems to be that whereas complete petroleum sanctions would no doubt quickly and effectively cripple Italian activities,  nothing but complete sanctions can be expected to be definitely and quickly effective,  and that to secure such comprehensive control the United States of America primarily but also Roumania and Russia must be whole-heartedly committed to them.December,  1935.

ANNEX    II. Oil&apos;&apos;  Supplies to Italy. Supplemental Memorandum by Petroleum Department of the Board of Trade,1.    The general position in regard to supplies of oil to Italy1was examined in the Memorandum by the Petroleum Department dated 20th November (Annex I to CP.  212 (35)).    In Section 6 (pages 6 and 7) of the Memorandum the conditions were set forth which were considered essential if an effective embargo such as was implied in proposal IV (a)  of the Committee of Eighteen was to be.effective.2.    In considering the possibility of securing,  by arrangements between exporting countries,  a limitation of exports of oil to Italy to normal figures pending the decision on the date of the oil sanction,   it is necessary to consider certain additional factors-with which it was not thought necessary to deal in the main memorandum.30    The first of these is a consideration of the organisation of &apos; the oil trade in Italy.On the basis of licences granted for the year 1935 to importing companies by the Italian Government under the Petroleum Law the internal trade (i.e.  excluding the bunker trade) amounting to about 2 million tons is held in the following proportions;-A.G.I.P.   (controlled by Italian Government) 27Standard Oil of New Jersey     2 5), OQSocony - Vacuum 3) American 28Shell 25Others 20100The most important among &quot;Others&quot; are the Italian subsidiaries of the Steaua Romana and Credit Menier, two Roumanian Companies, and a subsidiary of the Soviet oil organisation.
The A.I.O.G.  sells very little oil in Italy &quot;but by an arrangement between the Standard, Shell and Anglo-Iranian the latter is assured 20 per cent,  of the trade held by the other-two groups,  or about 10 per cent,  of the total internal trade. From time to time the Standard and Shell may also  take from the A.1.0.0.  additional quantities to meet their own share of the trade.From the above table,  it will be seen that 47 per cent, of the total Italian internal market is held by organisations outside the big groups and to a large extent these organisations must be regarded as not susceptible to influence in connection with any attempt at a voluntary arrangement to limit imports of oil into Italy.Even,   therefore,  if the Italian subsidiaries of the two Roumanian Cenrpani.es and of the soviet Oil Organisation may be regarded as being subject to control,  through action to regulate exports taken by the Roumanian and U.S.S.R. Governments, and the large oil greups were to limit their supplies to normal levels,  there would still remain the Italian Government-controlled organisation  (A.G.I.P) which handles 27 per cent, of the trade, and which will make every endeavour to obtain additional supplies from those countries which may not co-operate in limiting exports to normal quantities.      To the extent that they are successful Italy would obtain supplies in excess of normal requirements and, with strict rationing and conservation in Italy,  should be able to meet her emergency requirements in Abyssinia for a considerable period.4.  The next point to consider is what would be regarded as &quot;normal&quot; exports.      The second table on page 4 of CP. 212(35), covering what may be regarded as periods of normal trade,  shows quite considerable variations in the percentage of Italy&apos;s requirements provided by the principal supplying countries.    I;-a considerable extent these variations may be  due to the large
-oil companies modifying their sources of supply for purely trad reasons,  such as chane^s in prices, effect of currency regulation, etc.      It would therefore not be a simple matter to establish a generally acceptable datum line.Iranian Oil Shipments to Italy,On page 5 ?f CP.  812/35,  certain figures were given of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company&apos;s shipments to Italy for the period 1st January to 5th November.      These particulars were supplied by the Company and showed an increase in 1935 as compared with 1934.The Company have now supplied revised figures covering all Iranian oil shipments to Italy and have also brought the information up to the ond of November.      The revised figures are; -1934. 19 35.Tons.1st Jan.-5th Eov.   ..............    231,700 210,5001st Jan.-3Cth Nov.   .............     284.000 244,003These figures, show a decrease in 1935 for both periods ascompared with 1934,  and not an increase as the informationoriginally supplied indicated.Petroleum Department, 4th December,  1935.
