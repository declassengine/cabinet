After hearing evidence submitted on behalf of the    jMinistry of Health,  and some other interests, the Joint Committee   jpassed the following Resolution on the 25th of July last .&quot;That the Committee, having considered the Reports of      I the Committees which have sat on the same or analogous subjects,  and having heard evidence submitted on behalf of the Ministry of Health, the Waterworks Association,  the Advisory Committee on Water Supplies, the Water Companies Association and the Institution of Water Engineers,  are satisfied -(1)    That the aggregate available supply of water is ample for all anticipated requirements of the country.(2) That a number of problems of distribution, compensatioj and similar matters are outstanding and should be deal] with without delay. &amp;B(3)    That sufficient material and experience is possessed by the Ministry of Health to  enable the legislation necessary to deal -with the above to be drafted.(4)    That any matters of controversy or of detail, which ai Jj likely to arise in connection with such legislation, can best be considered after a preliminary memorandum I has.been prepared and issued by the Ministry of HealtlB for consideration.(5)    That pending the issue of such memorandum, no useful purpose can be served by the Committee hearing furthr.-[ i evidence on the subject matter referred to them. AI(6)    That a memorandum crystallising possible points of controversy should be prepared by the Ministry of Health and circulated to all parties likely to be interested to enable the Committee to hear evidence iS criticism after the Recess&quot; . I&apos;1. I -
As requested by the Joint Committee a Memorandum was prepared by my Department giving a list of proposals which might be considered for legislation.      This Memorandum was circulated on the 27th August last to twenty-five parties likely to be interested, with the request that if they wished to object to legislative effect being given to any of the proposals&quot;- in the Memorandum they should submit their criticisms to the Joint Committee in order that they might be considered by them, and,  if necessary,  the opposing parties heard.     &quot;When the dissolution came only a few of the parties had forwarded to the Joint Committee their views on the Memorandum.It is highly desirable that this investigation by a Joint Committee of both Houses should be continued and completed, and I would propose,  therefore, with the concurrence of my colleagues to move that a new Joint Select Committee should be appointed with the same Terms of Reference.(Intld.) K. W.4th December,  1935.
