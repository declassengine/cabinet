THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  September 1935.SECRET. ,     Copy No.CP. 182 (35).CABINET.TRANS-ATLANTIC AIR SERVICE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.IN connection with the Memorandum CP. 164 (35) which I have already circulated, I think the Cabinet should have before them the report of the Imperial Committee on the Trans-Atlantic Air Service, which sat during the Ottawa Conference.The Committee consisted of the following representatives :   Canada The Hon. H. Guthrie, K.C., M.P. (Chairman).Major-General A. G. McNaughton, with Technical Assistants from the Department of National Defence, Post Office Department, the Department of External Affairs and the Department of Marine.United Kingdom Sir William Clark, High Commissioner.Lieutenant-Colonel F. C. Shelmerdine, Director of Civil Aviation.Newfoundland -Mr. Emerson and Mr. Hutchings.Irish Free State Mr. Lemass and Mr. Walshe.The Committee held a number of meetings during the Ottawa Conference and presented the attached report dated 16th August, 1932. I have not thought it necessary to circulate the voluminous appendices to the report.In particular I would draw the attention of my colleagues to paragraph 6A of the report, in which the Committee recommend that the Governments should agree that in the development of Trans-Atlantic air routes they will give every possible preference to the route, United Kingdom, Irish Free State, Newfoundland and Canada.The Committee did not complete its report until the very end of the Ottawa Conference. I understand that the Canadian Government were extremely anxious to have the report included in the formal record of the Conference and raised this, matter with the High Commissioner, just as the British Delegation was leaving. They even proposed to send a special messenger after Mr. Baldwin, to Quebec, in order to secure his signature. Sir William Clark wisely discouraged such precipitous procedure; and, had more time for consideration been available, I imagine it would have been embarrassing to include in the Conference proceedings a report to which the Irish Free State were parties. The substance of the report has, however, I understand, never been questioned by any of the parties, and has. indeed, been acted upon by the Departments concerned in this country and the Dominions and Newfoundland ever since.P C -LSeptember 24, 1935.[12147]
. &apos;   : &apos; . Committee on Trans-Atlantic Air. Service.,  ;&apos;     -  &apos; - August 16, 1932.THE Committee appointed to consider trans-Atlantic air service submits the following report:    - ,,.1. Efficient - and rapid means of inter-communication and transport are essential to world commerce and trade. Air transport is becoming a constantly increasing factor in this. Traffic on the trans-Atlantic trade route far exceeds that on any other in quantity and value. On this route the traffic now exists in sufficient quantity, value and urgency to justify the operation of an express service by air, supplementary to the present means of transport and communication.2. Canada, the United Kingdom, the Irish Free State and Newfoundland control the approaches to the most direct trans-Atlantic crossing.3. Activity on the part of foreign Governments in aeronautical research, airway surveys, agreements for the right to construct and maintain air naviga-tional facilities on these routes is increasing. It is imperative that steps should be taken by the four Governments concerned to safeguard their position relative to trans-Atlantic air services.4. The development in aeronautical science is rapid and cumulative and justifies the conviction that within a comparatively few years reliable&apos; trans-Atlantic air services will be practical.5. Pending this, the operation of a combined air and steamer service will make possible material savings in the time of transit. Experience in its operation will be a large factor in the solution of trans-Atlantic flying and will place those having it in an advantageous position in the solution of the major problem. Any expenditures made oh air navigation facilities for such a service will be a direct contribution towards the construction and operation of a trans-Atlantic airway.6. The Committee recommends the acceptance by the Governments concerned of the following agreements and statements :  (a) The Governments agree that in the development Of trans-Atlantic air routes they will give every possible preference to the route United Kingdom, Irish Free State, Newfoundland and Canada- and that they wili not actively support the development of any other route, or give privileges to any foreign Government or their nationals in respect to the operation of trails-Atlantic air services, or air and steamer services, or the establishment of air bases or air navigation facilities for the purpose of such services, without full and prior consultation with each other.(b) The Governments agree that any application received for these privileges by any Government will be at once communicated for the confidential information of the others.(c) The Governments agree that they will freely and mutually interchange all meteorological information as it becomes available and give sympathetic considera-tion to the establishment of any supplementary meteorological observing stations which may be shown to be required for the proper development of this service.(d) The Government of Canada agrees to make the necessary air surveys in Newfoundland without cost to that Government, and to provide it with the complete report for its information and consideration. In particular, the Goveffi-ment of Canada agrees to examine this season the possibilities of air routes to the Maritime Provinces, from the Straits of Belle Isle via Newfoundland, and from St. John&apos;s, Newfoundland. These routes have been indicated as being of immediate interest to the Government of Newfoundland.(e) It will be necessary for the Governments of the United Kingdom and the Irish Free State&apos; &quot;td iriaW the&apos; arrangements - required&quot;&apos;for the air survbys in their respective countries. - &apos;(/) The Government of Canada agrees to give early consideration to the re-establishment of the airway, and air mail service from Montreal to Moncton, Halifax and Sydney, and to using their good offices with the Steamship Companies-^ :.&apos;&apos;;    (!) to obtain their co-operation in the handling of fast mails, winter and summer;
(2) to provide the transfer arrangements at Atlantic coast points;(3) to make a selected port in the south of Ireland a port of call, or transfer by tender, as may be found desirable, as soon as arrangements are made by the Irish Free State and the United Kingdom for the handling, by air, of mails from and to London and the Continent.        -(g) The Governments agree that the division of any revenue from the service shall be in accordance with the rules of the Postal Union or as Otherwise mutually agreed: 1(A) The provision and maintenance of air facilities within their respective territories is primarily a matter for each Government. It is recognised that in certain cases the installation of air navigation facilities in the territory of one Government may be necessary for the operation of services in another. In such cases the Governments agree to give sympathetic consideration to their provision on request, the division of any costs to be subject to negotiation.7. The committee has considered the operation of a weekly combined air and steamer trans-Atlantic mail service. The difficulties of this service due to the climate are frankly admitted, but the progress of the past ten years justifies confidence that with experience in operation, suitable aircraft and modern aids to air navigation, the difficulties can be mastered, and that an increasingly efficient service can be provided.(a) During the summer season the saving of time by the combined service is remarkable. Using aircraft on the Canadian end only, mails are landed in Montreal four days after despatch from London. If aircraft are used on the European end as well, this time will be still further reduced by at least twelve hours. A service of three and a half days will definitely establish the St. Lawrence route as the high speed communication route between Europe and North America. During the winter season the-service will be at least equal in speed to that given by the fastest steamers on the New York routes, provided the trans-Atlantic crossing by steamer from the final point of departure in the United Kingdom to Halifax is not more than six days.(b) Study of combined air and steamer services off the European coasts prove that these are only practical when &quot;Channel&quot; ports (i.e., Southampton, Cherbourg, Plymouth, &amp;c.) are used. With steamers on the route by the North of Ireland, the saving of time by using an air service between London and the most westerly practical point of contact would not be material or justify its cost.(c) When steamers use the &quot; Channel &quot; ports, their course passes near the South-West of Ireland, over four hundred (400) miles from their normal point of departure. If this distance is flown and the mails transferred to the steamer there, a material saving of time of at least twelve hours results, and it is recom-mended that steps be taken by the Governments concerned to operate this service when steamers use the Channel ports.(d) Sufficient information is not available on this portion of the route to enable the committee to make a definite estimate of the capital or operational expense involved; having regard to the conditions to be met which are relatively favourabley it is considered that the costs per mile will not exceed those oh the Canadian portion of the route, which costs are shown in the report to be economically justifiable.   (Per details, see Appendix &quot; E.&apos;&quot;&apos;)(e) On the North American end of the route the seasonal changes of ports used by steamers on the Canadian service necessitate the consideration of three different operations :  (i) The winter service 1st December-20th April (approx.) when Halifax isthe port of transfer, (ii) The summer service 1st July (approx.)-30th November, when thesteamers enter the St. Lawrence by the Straits of Belle Isle, (iii) The spring period 2.0th April-1st July, when steamers enter the St. Lawrence by Cabot Straits.(/) Winter service.--Particulars of the operation of an air mail service between Halifax and Montreal; capital and operating costs will be found in Appendix &quot;A.&quot; Halifax is five hours by air from Montreal; the train time is twenty-five and one-half hours. A fully equipped airway to Montreal would .serve domestic traffic with efficiency and would expedite domestic as well as
overseas mails. It is part of the trans-Canada airway, ana&apos; its construction and operation for these purposes is recommended, quite apart from the marked additional advantages to be derived from the trans-Atlantic service.(g) Summer service. Belle Isle to Montreal. Two routes are under consideration :  (i) Direct by the North -Shore of the St. Lawrence, Anticosti and Rimouskito Montreal (Appendix &quot; B &quot;). (ii) Via northern Newfoundland, St. George&apos;s Bay, Shediac, and Moncton to Montreal (Appendix &quot; C &quot;).Surveys are now being made to determine the best route, and until these are completed exact information as to the cost of construction cannot be furnished. The known data are given in Appendices &quot;B&quot; and C.&quot; The route by Moncton has the advantage that it would greatly enhance the benefit of this service to the Maritime Provinces and Newfoundland, and would make use between Montreal and Moncton of all facilities provided, for the winter service. Operation of the route would thus be greatly facilitated and cheapened. It is recommended that the surveys should be continued, and that operations on the chosen route should be initiated next summer.(h) The spring season involves transfer from ship to air in Cabot Straits or off the Coast of Newfoundland. No experience in this operation is yet available and no surveys have been made to determine the best point of transfer. The route Moncton to Montreal would be used in any case, and an estimate is given of the cost of extending this airway from Moncton to Sydney (see Appendix &quot; C.1 &quot;). It is recommended that surveys should be continued to determine the best point of contact with steamers during the spring weeks, and that when this is determined arrangements should be made for the regular transfer of the mails to the air at the selected point and their carriage thence via Moncton to Montreal.(i) The experiments made during the past three years in catapulting seaplanes from mail steamers off the Atlantic Coast have been considered. This plan is not recommended for adoption. It is neither efficient nor economical at present. The experiments should be carefully watched, as if they should prove eventually to give a safe and efficient service a similar method could be adopted off the Newfoundland and Irish Coast with even greater savings of time in the transit of mails.(j) Appendices, as follows, are submitted herewith : &quot;A&quot; Montreal-Halifax airway&quot; B &quot; Montreal-Rimouski-Havre St. Pierre-Red Bay airway&quot; C &quot; Montreal-Moncton-Shediac-St. George Harbour-Red Bay airway&quot; C.1 &quot; Moncton-Sydney airway&quot; D &quot; Meteorological and radio services&quot; E &quot; London-South West Coast of Ireland airway, furnished by Director of Civil Aviation, United Kingdom.&quot; F &quot; Memorandum on combined air and steamer mail service between Canada and Europe, showing savings of time and estimates of Cost and Revenue, furnished by the Post Office Department, Canada.H.
