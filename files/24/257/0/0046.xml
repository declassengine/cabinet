THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1935.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 226 (35)CABINET.USE OF TEAR GAS IN THE  COLONIAL EMPIRE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.MY colleagues will be aware that in December, 1933, the Secretary of State for the Colonies circulated two memoranda, CP. 301 (33) and CP. 301a (33), relating to a proposal by the High Commissioner for Palestine that, on humanitarian grounds, the use of tear gas by the Police Force in Palestine, for the purpose of avoiding casualties in dispersing illegal assemblies and riotous crowds, should be permitted.2. These memoranda were considered by the Cabinet at their meeting on the 20th December, 1933, and it was agreed (Cabinet Conclusions 70 (33), para-graph 3) That the Secretary of State for the Colonies should authorise the High Commissioner for Palestine to use tear gas in dealing with mobs and riots in cases where otherwise it would be necessary to shoot.3. A subsequent memorandum (CP. 36 (35)) was circulated in February, 1935, and at their meeting on the 20th February, 1935, the Cabinet agreed that the Secretary of State for the Colonies should be empowered to authorise the High Commissioner for Palestine to permit the use of tear gas by the Police Force in circumstances, such as dealing with banditry, where there is a serious risk of casualties being incurred by the Police Force if the Police were unable to use gas and had to rely on other weapons.4. Since that date it has been necessary to seek Cabinet authority separately for the purchase of tear gas apparatus and its use, subject to specified conditions, in Ceylon (CP. 117 (35)), and also, after consulting the Prime Minister, the late Secretary of State authorised its use in recent riots in Northern Rhodesia. Its use was not, in fact, required.5. Another case, in which in all probability the use of tear gas would have saved the life of a rioter who was shot, was in Jamaica, where the Police, in order to prevent the mob from rescuing a prisoner, were compelled to fire, with the result that one of the rioters was killed.6. I am of the opinion that, in general, and on humane grounds, authority might reasonably be given for the purchase of supplies of tear gas by Colonial Governments generally, and for its use, subject to definite and specified conditions, without prior reference to the Secretary of State.7. I have ascertained that in the United States of America the gas is constantly used by both the Police and the National Guard. Tear gas has also been used in India, Germany, and Austria, whilst in Italy the Italian Royal Corps of Public Security Agents are armed with tear gas bombs as part of their standard equipment. In France a Ministerial Instruction published in November, 1934, on the use of French troops in civil disturbances states that they may be provided with &apos;&apos; engins speciaux &apos;&apos; for maintaining order without blood-shed, which would seem to cover the employment of tear gas.   It appears that[12426]
the gas can be used efficiently by any trained Police Force, the essentials being discipline and a reasonable degree of intelligence. Its use would undoubtedly tend to reduce the number of occasions demanding the intervention of armed forces in aid of the civil power.8.   As regards the conditions and occasions on which the use of tear gas should be authorised, I recommend that it be used (a) By Police Forces in the Colonial Dependencies, when they have receivedthe requisite training.(b) Normally under the authority of the Governor or Officer administering the Government, but at the discretion of the Head of the Police Force, if the Governor thinks fit to delegate this authority.(c) In circumstances such as dealing with banditry, where there is a serious risk of casualties being incurred by the Police Force if the Police were unable to use gas and had to rely on other weapons. id) In the arrest of armed individuals, who, having sought refuge in a building or other place of vantage, might evade arrest with the aid of fire arms.(e) In dealing with mobs and riots in cases where it would otherwise be necessary to shoot.9. If, therefore, the Cabinet approves, I should propose to&apos; authorise the Governments of the Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories, where such authority has not already been given, to purchase supplies of tear gas and suitable apparatus to be used by those Governments on the occasions and under the conditions indicated in paragraph 8. At the same time, I should propose, with the approval of the Cabinet, to lay down conditions as to the training &apos; required by the Police before the equipment is allowed to be used.(Initialled) J. H. T.Colonial Office, Downing Street, December 3, 1935.
