(35) 34. The Report came before.the Ministerial Committee at their 9th Meeting, but no decision was taken as to whether it would be desirable to retain this clause in any future Treaty.The First Lord of the Admiralty has suggested, that if, in the forthcoming. Naval Conference, the Japanese seem to attach importance to the perpetuation of Article XIX it would be possible to use this as a bargaining factor in order to secure their agreement on some other proposition e.g., in connection with qualitative limitation but he appreciates that final decision on this cannot be taken until it is known what importance, if any, the Japanese actually attach to it. In the. meantime, however, the First Lord is of the opinion that it would, be of advantage to reach a decision on the purely strategical merits of the Chief s^ of Staffs recommendation, and the Report is, therefore, circulated herewith for further consideration. . &apos; .       ;(Signed) M.

ENCLOSUBE.[Paper No. C.O.S. 360.]&quot;STATUS QUO&quot; IN THE PACIFIC,Article XIX of the Washington Treaty for the Limitation of naval armaments.&apos; Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.AT the 266th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 22nd November, 1934, the Chief of the Naval Staff informed the Committee that the Chiefs of Staff proposed to consider the effect of the possible abrogation of the Washington Agreement on the defence position in the Far East, with special reference to the fortification of our bases. The Chiefs of Staff have now had this subject under consideration and submit the following observations.2. It is known that Japan intends to give notice to abrogate the Washington Treaty before the end of this year. The question therefore arises as to whether Article XIX of that Treaty (see Appendix) should be one of the points to be conceded again to the Japanese in any new agreement that may be reached.3. So far as the British Empire is concerned, the strategical significance of the area covered by the status quo clause lies principally in its application to the following territories : British.- Hong Kong, British North Borneo, Brunei and Sarawak. :.   Japanese. Kurile, Bonin, Loochoo Islands, Formosa and the Pescadores.%&apos;. In their application to America the provisions of Article XIX might deprive us of effective naval assistance from the United States, because they preclude that country from making adequate fortified bases in the Southern Pacific, from which their Fleet could operate in Japanese waters.! 5, It has been accepted by the Committee of Imperial Defence* that, in the event of war between the British Empire and Japan, our initial policy would be mainly defensive. Japan&apos;s most probable initial policy would be a vigorous offensive, to exploit her advantage of local superiority and designed to hamper the operations of our Main Fleet after its arrival in the Far East. With Singapore adequately defended, it must be accepted that Japan would direct her offensive to capturing or destroying the naval facilities at Hong Kong and to the attack on, or occupation of, the oilfields, air facilities, &amp;o, in Borneo.. .6- The termination of the status quo clause would, financial and political considerations permitting, enable Hong Kong to be more heavily defended against attack by the Japanese Fleet. It would also, of course, permit an increase in Japanese defences in Formosa and the Pescadores, but having regard to the brief period likely to be available before the arrival of the British Main Fleet (five to seven weeks) the increase in Japanese offensive power would not, it is considered, compare with the increase in the defensive capacity of Hong Kong, though as stated in paragraphs 11 and 12, the air situation would still be one of great anxiety. It would be possible to increase the security of British North Borneo, Brunei and Sarawak, and with Hong Kong and Singapore secure from Japanese naval attack, our naval distributions might be arranged to contribute more to the defence of these territories in the early part of the war.7. Any increase in the defences or naval facilities in the Japanese Kurile, Bonin and Loochoo Islands would not constitute any material threat to our security, although it would increase the difficulty of any operation that might be undertaken by us to the northward of Hong Kong.8. We have also considered the question of the Japanese Mandated Territories, and the conclusion we have reached as to the Mandated Territories is that they have no practical bearing on the question of the renewal of the status quo, but this conclusion is, of course, subject to confirmation by the Foreign* C.I.D./266th Meeting, Minute 2.
Office and the precise interpretation which may be given in international law to the position of these Territories. ;--:&quot;&quot;) v. &apos;;&quot; :9. From a purely strategical point of view, we have, from the considerations outlined above, arrived at the conclusion that it would be to our advantage to be no longer bound by Article XIX of the Washington Treaty, but we feel bound to point out other matters outside the strategical field which will have a very material bearing on the ultimate decision as to the retention or otherwise of this Article in any agreement that may be reached.10. The first of these considerations is th?d of finance. If we are to turn Hong Kong into a. first-class Naval Base and put it into a state of defence commensurate with the condition in which, no doubt, Japanese naval bases will be put, it would involve heavy expenditure which has not been catered for in the programmes sanctioned by the Cabinet for the making good of our existing deficiencies. The forms of attack with which we may have to deal, and against which adequate provision is not now made, are bombardment by capital ships, attack by strong land forces aiming at the capture of the fortress, and heavy air attack. *11. Defence against bombardment by capital ships would involve the installation of heavy guns necessitating heavy expenditure. Adequate defence against a large scale land attack would also necessitate an increase in the garrison, and would involve the War Office in a further heavy financial commit-ment. It has been estimated that a minimum of 4 Squadrons will be required for defence against air attack, but the area of the colony is inadequate for the development of a defence adequate to meet the scale of air attack which could be launched by Japan from shore bases in China if she abrogates or disregards the Nine-Power Treaty. It will be seen, therefore, that the financial aspect of-the question is serious.12. Even if the necessary funds were made available there are great practical difficulties in establishing at Hong Kong without a delay of some years the full scale of defence which, if Article XIX of the Washington Treaty had been abrogated, would be required as a counterpoise to similar action by Japan. The War Office already have difficulty in providing the necessary personnel - for the completion of the defences at Singapore, and they would not be able to under -take any new liability for Hong. Kong without a material increase in the Army. One further aerodrome is already under consideration at Hong Kong, and it is unavoidable that it should be located outside the defended area of the fortress/ Not only is the area of the colony inadequate, but the provision of such facilities for the operation of aircraft as can be made available is likely to involve much delay and expense. &apos;    -13. It will be seen, therefore, that even if financial provision could be made, for the equipment of Hong Kong to a full scale, there are other serious difficulties which would have to be overcome, and there appears to be little or no prospect of our being able to place Hong Kong in a fully satisfactory state of defence vis-a-vis Japan within the next few years.14. There is one aspect of the whole question to which we desire to draw&apos; attention : when the Washington Treaty was negotiated in 1922, Article XIX was introduced in order to induce the Japanese to accept a ratio of 60 per cent. Article XIX, in fact, was, at the time, put forward as being in her favour, and it is believed that they still attach importance to the maintenance of this Article., They may well hold that, in present circumstances, they could capture Hong Kong before its relief by the British Main Fleet, and that we should not be able seriously to threaten their security if our Fleet were limited to operating from. Singapore. If that be so, then we are of the opinion that if the Article is to be retained in some form, we should seek to gain compensation for it in some other direction, as we did in 1922. Moreover, we consider that the Article is in need&apos; of some redrafting in order to make it applicable to present conditions. We understand that Japan is prohibited from obtaining air bases in China from&apos; which to operate against Hong Kong by the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty. Apart from that, however, the question of the employment of air forces on a large scale, which had hardly come into being in this connection in 1922, has materially altered the position. We suggest that any new agreement that may be reached to replace Article XIX should be framed so as to define the precise position regarding air forces, which at present is somewhat vague.
15;.: There are other matters which will similarly require re-corisideration, as, for example, the question of the storage of naval mines, &amp;c, which, at present, is limited under Article XIX.Conclusions.16. From the strategical point of view it would, we consider, be to our advantage to be no longer bound by the status quo agreement, but the advantage to us of its abrogation is dependent on a number of factors which we have referred to above. It is certain that if we are unable, for financial or other reasons, to place Hong Kong in a state of defence equivalent to that in which the Japanese will certainly place their bases, then we shall stand to lose more than we shall gain. If, on the other hand, it is decided that Article XIX, amended to meet the needs of the present day, be retained, then we strongly urge that we should obtain some quid pro quo from Japan in other directions for the retention of that Article as was done in 1922.(Signed) ERNLE CHATFIELD.A.

ELLINGTON.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, November 27, 1934.APPENDIX.Extract from the Treaty between the United States of America, the British Empire, France, Italy and Japan for the Limitation of Naval Armament? Washington, February 6, 1922.,:.;;(; r     * * * * * *Article XIX.The United States, the British Empire and Japan agree that the status quo-at the time of the signing of the present Treaty, with regard to fortifications and naval bases, shall be maintained in their respective territories and possessions specified hereunder :- ,, 1. The insular possessions which the United States now holds or may here-&apos; ... after acquire in the Pacific Ocean, except (a) those adjacent to thecoast of the United States, Alaska and the Panama Canal Zone, not including the Aleutian Islands, and (b) the Hawaiian Islands; 2. Hong Kong and the insular possessions which the British Empire now holds or may hereafter acquire in the Pacific Ocean, east of the meridian of 110o east longitude, except (a) those adjacent to the coast of Canada, (b) the Commonwealth of Australia and its territories, and (c) New Zealand; &apos; 3. The following insular territories and possessions of Japan in the Pacific-Ocean, to wit : the Kurile Islands, the Bonin Islands, Amami-Oshima, the Loochoo Islands, Formosa and the Pescadores, and any insular territories or possessions in the Pacific Ocean which Japan may here-after acquire.The maintenance of the status quo under the foregoing provisions implies that no new fortifications or naval bases shall be established in the territories and possessions specified; that no measures shall be taken to increase the existing naval facilities for the repair and maintenance of naval forces, and that no increase shall be made in the coast defences of the territories and possessions above specified. This restriction, however, does not preclude such repair and replacement of worn-out weapons and equipment as is customary in naval and mditary establishments in time of peace.JJ. -At Jf. Jt. JA.
