(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNICMAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).COPY NO.SECRET.CP, 241  (35;CABINET.INDIA.Appreciation of the Political Situation, by the Government of India, dated 13th December,  1935.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential Appreciation of the Political Situation in India, dated the 13th December,  1935? issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.1. The disputes between the three communities inLahore have again overshadowed other events of the month. On the 26th November a Sikh was severely assaulted by one or more Muslims, possibly as a result of a personal, not a communal,   quarrel.      On the evening of the 29th the victim died and, as a result of this and of another small fracas between a Sikh and a Muslim lad, feelings were very tense when, on the 30th, a monster Hindu-Sikh procession, for which preparations had been in train during the past fortnight, marched through the city. The organisers appear to have been anxious to avoid any actual conflict, but one serious clash occurred, in which 16 Muslims and a few Sikhs received injuries before the fighting was controlled.      Next day, December 1st,  there was more serious rioting;    a body of Sikhs came in conflict with some Muslims near a mosque and were only extricated with great difficulty by the police.This aroused general excitement and sporadic rioting and assaults- occurred throughout the city. Additional police and troops were quickly brought in and by the evening the authorities had succeeded in getting the situation under control.      The casualties, considering the wide area over which the rioting took place,  were surprisingly small.      This was largely due to the excellent work of the police in breaking up the fights as soon as they started, while the knowledge that both sides were to
some extent armed, made each respect the other.      There were no cases of arson and practically no cases of looting, and since the rioting there have been only one or two cases of isolated murderous assaults, which are usually the aftermath of mob rioting.The events of December 1st have made members of all communities realise that they are playing with fire, and the drastic measures which the Punjab Government and the local authorities have taken to prevent further disturbances have generally been recognised as essentially necessary;    in fact, in some Congress papers, the Government have been criticised for not taking this action at an earlier stage.     A curfew order has been imposed; orders against processions and demonstrations have been issued; and the carrying of weapons of all kinds, including kirpans by Sikhs, has been prohibited.      This last order has given rise to protests from the Sikhs who contend that the kirpan is a religious emblem and that the order is an interference with their religious rights.      In making this protest they are on weak ground for the order does not apply to small symbolical kirpans but only to kirpans which can be used as dangerous weapons of offence,  and it is clear that when feelings are as high as in Lahore after the events of the last few months such an order is fully justified.Practically all the isolated murderous attacks have been made on Sikhs by Muslims, and this has not unnaturally made the former more determined not to give way an inch.      There is also, of course, the danger of reprisals, and,  if these murderous attacks continue, the Sikhs are likely to retaliate.      Underlying the whole agitation is the fear of the Muslim majority under the new
3.-constitution felt by Hindus and Sikhs, some of latter hardly concealing the fact that they would be glad if the new constitution did not come into being in its present form.      The Government of India Act, 1935j has, however, made it clear to them that this is out of the question.The situation thus still presents very dangerous potentialities, but it is to be hoped that the preventive measures adopted by the Punjab Government and the knowledge that further measures,  such as the posting of additional police at the cost of one or other of the communities will, if the need arises, be taken will prevent any further serious outbreaks, and that, by degrees,  the leaders of both parties will adopt a more conciliatory and reasonable attitude.2. Elsewhere the country is quiet.      In Congresscircles disputes over the question of acceptance of the reforms still continue.     Mr. Satyamurti, a Madras leader, has stated that Congressmen hoped to be ministers responsible to Legislatures this time next year:    on the other side,  a Punjab Congress leader, Sardul Singh, is reported to have said that Congress was committed to mass action to carry the country to the desired goal and that they could not lead the country to the goal of Swaraj by working a constitution which was admitted to be reactionary not only by all Congressmen, but also by all other political parties.
