THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1935.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 215 (35).CABINET.COLONIAL GOVERNORS&apos; PENSIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.ON the 26th July, 1934, the Cabinet authorised Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, then Secretary of State for the Colonies, to prepare a Bill to amend in certain respects the provisions of the Pensions (Governors of Dominions, &amp;c.) Acts, 1911 and 1929. The amendments contemplated were explained in Cabinet Paper 186 (34).A Bill was accordingly prepared, in consultation between the Treasury, the Dominions Office and the Colonial Office, and was referred to the Home Affairs Committee in June 1935. On the 24th June the Committee recommended that the immediate introduction of the Bill should be authorised, and accordingly on the 26th July a Financial Resolution was moved in the House of Commons as follows :  &quot; That   it   is   expedient   to   amend   the   Pensions   (Governors   of Dominions, (fee.) Acts, 1911 and 1929, by making provision (1) with respect to the nature and period of service qualifying persons for the grant of pensions under section one of the Pensions (Governors of Dominions, &amp;c.) Act, 1911;(2) with respect to the meaning of the expression &apos; service in the permanent Civil Service of the State&apos;; and(3) for granting in certain circumstances to persons who, after serving as Governors within the meaning of the said Act, have served in the office of Governor-General of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, pensions in respect of their service as such Governors and in respect of their employ -ment (if any) in service in the permanent Civil Service of the State within the meaning of the said Acts as amended in pursuance of this Resolution;and to authorise the payment out of moneys provided by Parliament of the sums required to defray such expenditure as may be occasioned by the said amendments.&quot;The Resolution was agreed to after the briefest of debates, the Leader of the Labour Opposition supporting its passing with the reservation that when a. Bill was introduced his Party would hope to have time to discuss the matter, while Sir Robert Hamilton also supported the proposal (Hansard, the 26th July, 1935, column 2267). The Bill was then introduced and was read for the first time on the 29th July. Copies of the memorandum on the Financial Resolution (Cmd. 4952) and of the Bill are appended.Owing to the dissolution it proved impossible to make any further progress with the Bill during the last Session. The grounds, however, on which it was originally put forward, as explained in CP. 186 (34), still obtain, and I hope that the Cabinet will authorise the taking of immediate steps with a view to [12388]&apos;
Colonial Office, Downing Street, November 27, 1935.the Bill being reintroduced at the earliest possible date during the forthcoming Session. The tenour of the debate referred to above is, I hope, a sufficient indication that the Bill is not likely to be made a matter of controversy, and I am anxious that, if at all possible, it should complete its stages and receive the Royal Assent before the Vacation. Unless this can be done, I anticipate some serious inconvenience, since arrangements have been made for certain-Colonial Governors to vacate their offices in the near future, and in some cases, if the pensions are to be computed on the existing inadequate basis, the result will be to create hardship which was not contemplated at the time when the retirements in question were decided upon.(Initialled) J.

PENSIONS (GOVERNORS OF DOMINIONS, Etc.)Memorandum on the Financial resolution on this Resolution will be founded a Bill to amend certain of the provisions of the Pensions (Governors of Dominions, etc.) Acts, 1911 and 1929, which authorize the grant of pensions from the Exchequer in respect of service as Governor of any part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions, of a Protectorate, or of a Mandated Territory.The amendments of the existing law proposed are as follows :-(1) Length of service qualifying for pension at the rates provided in the Acts.Section 1 of the Act of 1911 provides that on retirement at the age of 60 (or in certain circumstances at an e&quot;arlier age) a Governor who has served as such for ten years or more may be granted a pension at rates proscribed in Section 2 of that Act, as amended by Section 1 (1) of the Act of 1929. Under Section 5 (1) of the Act of 1911 a Governor who has previously served in the Home or Colonial civil service may be granted a pension in respect of his Governors service after less than ten years&apos; service as Governor, if he retires in certain circumstances (i.e., on account of age, ill health, abolition of office, or the absence of further appropriate employment); but in these cases pension i3 calculated not at the rates prescribed in the Governors&apos; Pensions Acts but at the ordinary Home civil service rates laid down in the Superannuation Acts, and is based on the actual pensionable emoluments last drawn in the civil service post previously held. Thus an officer who is promoted from the civil service to a Governorship derives no pension benefit from that pro-motion unless he serves for at least ten years after promotion.It is proposed to provide that where a Governor with previous civil service, either in the United Kingdom or in a Colony, Protec-torate, or Mandated Territory, has served for at least three years as Governor and his total continuous service as a Governor and in the civil service amounts to not less than ten years he may, if this is more favourable than the civil service pension under Section 5 (1) of the Act of 1911, receive a pension in respect of his Governor^ service on the; special scale and subject to the, conditions prescribed in the Governors&apos; Pensions Acts.The proposed amendment will not affect the position of Governors with no previous civil service, who wOl still be required to complete ten years&apos; service as Governor before becoming eligible for any pension.
(2) Service, in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.For qualifying purposes civil service is denned, in Section 7 of the Act of 1929, so as to include* service in any permanent office in the Government of any Colony, Protectorate or Mandated Territory which qualifies for pension out of the revenues of the Colony, Protectorate, or Mandated Territory. No account is at present taken of service in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.It is proposed to provide that this definition shall be extended to include similarly, for qualifying purposes, pensionable service under the Government of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.It is further proposed to make provision to the effect : (i) That when a Governor is an ex-Governor-General of the Sudan, his service in the latter Office shall count towards the minimum periods required to qualify for pension under the Acts, but shall not be taken into account in computing any pension under the Acts.(ii) That a person who, after service as a Governor under the Acts, is appointed to be Governor-General of the Sudan and retires from the latter office in circumstances entitling him to pension under the Sudan laws on the ground of age or ill health, may receive such pension in respect of his previous Governor &apos;s service as he might have received under the Acts if on completing such previous Governor&apos;s service he had been retired on the ground of ill health. If in such a case retirement from the Sudan takes place before the age of 60, for the sole reason that the retiring age for Governors-General of the Sudan is less than 60, pension in respect of the previous Governor&apos;s service will only be granted if no further appropriate employ-ment in the public service can be provided; and the pension will then be liable to reduction as provided by Section 9 of the Act of 1911 or Section 3 of the Act of 1929, as the case may be.In all the above cases any liability for pension in respect of service in the Sudan will be a matter for the Sudan Government.The maximum additional expense involved by the Bill is esti-mated, on the basis of previous experience, to be  2,000 a year.* Except for the purposes of Section 5 (2) of the Act of 1911, which provides for the grant of a gratuity in case of death in certain cases.(38762-29)  Wt. 3716-3410 875 7/36 P.
