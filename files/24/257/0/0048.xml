1/SECRET . COPY NO .   VPC^22h(35l. CABINET .EATING AND VALUATION . PROPOSED BILL. Memorandum, by the Minister of Health.I shall be glad to receive the authority of the Cabinet to the preparation of a Bill to assimilate in certain particulars the law in London,- relating to Rating and Valuation,  to that in the Provinces,  and to  effect some minor amendments in the provincial procedure for interim revision of valuation lists.The two principal provisions  (there would be a few others) would be as follows::--1.    In London,  as now in the Provinces since 1925,  a new valuation of property has to be carried out every five years.      In theProvinces, property may be reassessed during the quinquenniumif its value has changed for any reason.      In London this canbe done only if the change of value is due to some alteration oraddition to the property itself,  and the procedure is dilatory.This has given rise to legitimate grievances in London,particularly because owners of property have not been ableduring the present quinquennium to obtain derating concessions to which they would have been entitled in the Provinces.2.    In London each Borough is a separate unit for valuation.      Inthe Provinces, while there are local units for valuation,  thereis a County Valuation Committee for each County.      It isproposed to provide for a County Valuation Committee in London.The principal interests have been consulted,  includingthe London County Council, the Standing Joint Committee of theMetropolitan Borough Councils and Surveyors&apos;  Institution,  and substantial agreement reached,  subject to settlement of the precisecomposition of the County Valuation Committee.      I have little doubtthat on this point also agreement can be secured and that no serious opposition to the Bill need be anticipated.1.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT?
It is very desirable that the Bill should become law during the present Session so that any action necessary to correct the new assessments which will operate from April next can be taken during the rating period then commencing.(Intld.) K. W.5th December,  1935.
