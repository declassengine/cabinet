V THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. SECRET. COPY NO. X.CP.185(35).CABINET,International Labour Conference, 1954.Ratification of the Draft Convention regarding; benefit or allowances to the involuntarily unemployed.NOTE BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.At its Eighteenth Session held in June, 1934, the International LabourConference adopted a Convention and Re commendation concerning unemploymentinsurance and various forms of relief for the unemployed;   the texts are^_    attached.     It is necessary to decide whether the Convention shall be ratifiedand whether, and, if so, to what extent, the Recommendation shall be accepted.The Convention is so drafted that any country complies with it which giveseffect to its provisions either by a scheme of unemployment insurance or by ascheme of unemployment allowances or by a scheme combining these two.     I am satisfied that all the provisions are within the scope of our unemploymentinsurance lav/.     Consequently, ratification would not involve fresh legislation in this country.     On the other hand, fresh legislation inconsistent with theterms of the Convention could not properly be enacted during the currency of the ratification.     The Convention does not come into force until the expiry of twelve months after the date on which the ratifications of two Members of theInternational Labour Organisation have been registered with the Secretary-Generalof the League of Nations and thereafter the Convention comes into force for anyMember twelve months after the date on which its ratification has been registered.A Member which has ratified the Convention may denounce it after the expiration of five years from the date when it first comes into force and such denunciationwill not take effect until one year after the date on which it is registered withthe Secretariat.     In effect, it would not be proper for us to enact legislationconflicting with the provisions of the Convention before, at any rate,^ say, theautumn of 1942,     On the other hand, the terms of the Convention are tolerablywide, and, in particular, it does not prescribe rates of benefit or of contributions,though it does prescribe a normal minimum benefit period of 156 working days a yearand an absolute one of 78 working days a year.     On the whole, I do not anticipate that we should be embarrassed by ratification.     On general grounds it is desirablethat we should ratify Conventions when possible, and I recommend that we should doso in this case. *x*
so the Recommendation, unlike the Convention, need not be accepted.or rejected without qualification.     Moreover, if in the future any new legislation were introduced or other action taken which ran counter to any-thing which at the present moment is acceptable in the Recommendation all that would be required would be a notification to that effect to the Secretary-General of the League.     Such a step, however, would not involve a denunciation of the general obliagtion assumed by the acceptance of the Recommendation, which is limited to taking the whole matter into consideration and notifying Geneva of the action taken (if any).     The only points in the Recommendation to which it is necessary to take exception are the following paragraph 4 (d) suggests that &quot;Whenever possible, and in particular whenever satisfactory measures of supervision can be applied, special provision should be made for the relief in case of unemployment of persons of comparatively small means who work on their own account&quot;.     It is not our policy at present to devise special provisions for this class of case.Paragraph 5 indicates that the ultimate object is to include all workers manual and non-manual irrespective of income within an unemployment insurance scheme.     Again, this is not our present policy.Paragraph 10 does not fit the existing unemployment insurance disqualifica-tion on the ground of a stoppage of work due to a trade dispute.     That disqualification has a long history behind it and is not a provision to be tampered with.Paragraph 14 contemplates the creation of an emergency fund, which is not favoured in this country.Acceptance by H.M. Government of Paragraph 17 might give rise to difficulties as regards workers resident in the Irish Free State or Northern Ireland and working across the border and similarly as between the Irish Free State and Great Britain.I suggest that the Recommendation should be accepted subject to the reservations made above in relation to paragraphs 4(d), 5, 10, 14 and 17.The Treasury, the Dominions Office and the Home Office (for Northern Ireland) aro in agreement with what I propose.(initd.)

This Convention does not apply to seamen,  sea fishermen, or agricultural workers as these categories may be defined by national laws or regulations.

9 Q  6RECOMMENDATION   /No. 4-4?   CONCERNING   UMMI?L0B1BNT   INSURANCE   AND VARIOUS   FORMS   OF   RELIEF   FOR   THE   UNB3gPT.K)YJ5P.The General Conference of the International Labour Organisation of the League of Nations,Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, and having met in its Eighteenth Session on 4 June 1934, andHaving decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regard to unemployment insurance and various forms of relief for the unemployed, which is the second item on the Agenda of the Session, andHaving determined that these proposals shall take the form of a recommendation,adopts, this twenty-third day of June of the year one thousand nine hundred and thirty-four, the following Recommendation: The Conference,Having adopted a Draft Convention ensuring benefit or allowances to the involuntarily unemployed;Considering that this Draft Convention lays down the minimum conditions to be complied with by every scheme of unemployment insurance or assistance;Considering that it is desirable to indicate a number of general principles which practice shows to be best calculated to promote a satisfactory organisation of unemployment insurance and assistance;Recommends that each Member should take the following principles and rules into consideration:1.      In countries where compulsory insurance against unemployment is not in operation, steps should be taken to create such a system as soon as possible. 2.      In coiintries in which compulsory or voluntary unemployment insurance is in operation, a complementary assistance scheme should be maintained to cover persons who have exhausted their right to benefit and in certain cases those who have not yet acquired the right to benefit;    this scheme should be on a different ba.sis from the ordinary arrangements for the relief of destitution. 3,     All schemes for the payment of unemployment benefit or allowances should cover not only persons who are wholly unemployed, but also persons who are partially unemployed.
4.      (a) Unemployment instarance and assistance schemes should be applied as soon as possible to all persons who are employed under a contract of service, and to persons employed under a contract of apprenticeship with money payment. If, however, exceptions are considered necessary, they should be confined within the narrowest possible limits.(b) Such persons should be covered either by insurance or assistance until they reach the age at which they are entitled to an old-age pension.(c) If circumstances make it difficult to apply the general provisions relating to unemployment insurance to a particular class of workers, special arrangements should be made for the insurance of such workers.   These special arrangements should, aim in particular at ensuring adequate proof of unemploy-ment and at adapting the benefit to the normal earnings of the workers concerned.(d) Whenever possible, and in particular whenever satisfactory measures of supervision can be applied, special provision should be made for the relief in case of unemployment of persons of comparatively small means who work on their own account.5.     Where it is considered advisable to fix a maximum remuneration as a criterion of liability to insurance, only such-workers should thereby be excluded as are in receipt of remuneration sufficiently high for them to ensure their own protection against the risk of unemployment, the ultimate object being to include all workers manual and non-manual irrespective of income.6.     The qualifying period permitted by the Draft Convention should not exceed 26 weeks&apos; employment in an occupation covered by the scheme, or the payment of 26 weekly contributions or the equivalent, within twelve months preceding the claim for benefit, or alternatively 52 weeks, such employment, or 52 weekly contributions or the equivalent, within twenty-four months preceding the claim for benefit.7.     The period during which benefit is payable under national laws or regulations should be as long as is consistent with the solvency of the scheme and every effort should be made to pay allowances as long as claimants are in need of them.8.     Subject to the provisions concerning partially unemployed persons, of Articles 3 and 7 of the Draft Convention, and of paragraph 3 of the present
Recommendation, the waiting period permitted by the Draft Convention should not exceed eight days per spell of unemployment,9.      In deciding whether employment in an occupation other than that in which a claimant has previously been engaged is &quot;suitable employment&quot; for the purpose of the disqualification permitted by the. Draft Convention, account should be taken&apos; of the length of the claimant!s service in the previous occupation, his chances of obtaining work in it, his vocational training, and his suitability for the work.10.    Disqualification for the receipt of benefit or allowances on the ground that a claimant has lost his employment by reason of a stoppage of work due to a trade dispute should be confined to cases in which the claimant is directly interested in the dispute, and should in all oases cease when the stoppage of work ceases.11.      (a) The obligation to attend a course of vocational or other instruction permitted by the Draft Convention as a condition for the receipt of benefit or allowances should be imposed only if the unemployed person will derive an advantage therefrom either from the point of view of physical or mental well-being or of vocational or general capabilities,(b) When imposing on an unemployed person an obligation to accept employ-ment on relief works, account should be taken of his age, health, previous occupation and suitability for the employment in question.(c) Only works of an ^exceptional and temporary character, organised by the public authority by means of funds specially allocated for the relief of the unemployed, should be considered as relief works.12.    Part of the money allocated to the relief of unemployment should be available for the purpose of facilitating the return of unemployed persons to employment, such as vocational and other training, and the payment of fares to unemployed persons who find employment in a district other than that in which they have been residing.13.    There should be a periodical review by the competent authority of the financial position of insurance funds in order that they may be kept as far as possible solvent and self-supporting.    The financial arrangements should so far as possible include provisions to enable the scheme to surmount changes of short duration in the level of unemployment without change of the conditions governing the scheme.
14.    An emergency fund should be created for the purpose of ensuring the pay-ment, during periods of particularly severe unemployment, of the allowances provided for under national laws or regulations.15.    Provision should be made for the participation of representatives of the contributors in the administration of insurance schemes.16.    Equality of treatment should be applied in appropriate cases not only to the nationals of Members bound by the Convention but also to those of Members and States which, without having ratified the Convention, effectively apply its provisions.17.    States should regulate by means of bilateral agreements with neighbouring States the conditions under which benefit or allowances shall be paid to unemployed workers in frontier zone3 who have their residence in one country and who work in another.H.
