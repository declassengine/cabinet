THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITTANIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET. ..... COPY NO.   j,pj.CP. 240(55). CABINET.PROPOSALS   BEFORE   THE   INTERNATIONAL   LABOUR ORGANISATION   ON   THE   SUBJECT   OF   HOLIDAYS WITH   PAY.MEMORANDUM   BY &apos; THE   MINISTER   OF   LABOUR.1.     The subject of &quot;Holidays with pay&quot; was discussed at the Nineteenth Session of the International Labour Conference in June, 1935, when it was decided that the subject should be placed on the Agenda of the Twentieth Session (June, 1936) for final consideration.     Meanwhile, in common with other State Members of the International Labour Organisation, His Majesty&apos;s Government is called upon to reply to a questionnaire issued from Geneva to the Governments.    On the basis of the views expressed by the Governments the International Labour Organisation will prepare a Report which will probably include a Draft Convention for adojition at the next International Labour Conference.2.     The first two questions in the questionnaire are:-(l) Do you consider that the International Labour Conference should adopt, in the form of a Draft Convention, international regulations concerning holidays with pay? (2) Do you consider that, failing a Draft Convention, the conference should adopt a Recommendation? To reply in the affirmative to (l) of the questions quoted above would imply a willingness on the part of the Government to introduce legislation enforcing holidays with pay over a substantial part of industry.The remaining questions are concerned with details of the international regulations which might be incorporated in a Draft Convention or Recommendation, such details including the definition of holidays with pay, the scope of the regulations, qualifying conditions and duration of holidays, rates of pay during the holidays, measures for enforcement, eto.
3.     The representatives of His Majesty1 s Government at the 1935 International Labour Conference did not commit themselves to a statement of policy on this subject but such a statement is now due.     I have, therefore, followed the usual practice of obtaining the views of the National Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations and the Trades Union Congress General Council.4.     The Confederation state that &quot;the question of holidays with pay is one which cannot be considered apart from the question of wages, and, in view of the admitted inability of the International Labour Organisation to regulate wages internationally it would appear useless for any attempt to be made to deal internationally with Holidays with Pay&quot;, and that &quot;the question is not a matter which is appropriate for statutory compulsion and must be left for voluntary arrangements industry by industry or company by company in the light of the particular conditions, after due consideration of the surrounding circumstances, including those of cost, the effect on selling prices, export trade, and the resulting effect on employing capacity&quot;.The Trade Union Congress on the other hand, desire that all classes of workers should be covered by statutory regulations enforcing holidays with pay on the basis of one day for each two months of service up to two years and after two years1  service a. minimum holiday of twelve consecutive working days, the workers to receive their normal remuneration during these holidays.5,     I am convinced that, so far as the forthcoming International Labour Conference is concerned, there is no hope of reconciling the divergent views of the Confederation and the Trade Union Congress se,t forth above and it therefore remains to determine the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government on what is bound to be a subject of controversy at the 1936 Conference.      In these circumstances, I submit the following observations for the consideration of my colleague s:-(l) &quot;Holidays with pay&quot; is a question which in this country has not been regarded as requiring legislation.(2) In Great Britain holidays with pay are known to be granted to about 1,500,000 manual wage-earners by virtue of collective agreements between organisations of employers and of workpeople.    Other agreements are in existence covering employees of individual firms.    Some organisations of employers and certain Trade Boards have issued
recornraendations that employers in the tro.des concerned should grant holidays with pay,(3) In o.ddition, large numbers of Government and Local Authorities&apos; employees, salaried clerks and shop assistants and other salaried employe/s are regularly granted holidays with pay, as well as many workers on &quot;standing&quot; wages and wage-earners who are not parties to collective agreements.(4) Paid holidays, where such are granted, normally constitute part of the contract of service which deals with hours of work, rates of wages and other working conditions.     Paid holidays are indeed hound up with wages and salaries and it can &quot;be argued that wages are or may be fixed lower or higher according to whether there are paid holidays or not.(5) The proposal that there should be some form of internationalregulations providing for holidays with pay is in many respects analagous with the proposed application of the 40-hour week Convention as both proposals are put forward as a means of (a) providing more leisure for the workers,    (b) enabling the workers to share in the increasing productivity of industry, and (c) providing employment for a larger number of workers.(6) It is also the case that the international regulation of holidays with pay, as envisaged by its supporters, is open to objections which have already been made to the application of a 40-ho\.u- week Convention, via.(i) the competitive advantage of low-wage countries would be increased.(ii) the related question of ra,tes of wages would be ignored, (iii) collective agreements between employers and workers would be disturbed and the risk of industrial unrest increased,6,     Holidays with pay is a matter which has come into greater prominence in connection with discussions on the better distribution of work and leisure.    Little attention has been given, however, to the main practical problem;    that is, the method by which holidays can be arranged and financed in respect of the very large proportion of workpeople who pass during the
year from employer to employer in the same industry, or in different industries, with varying intervening periods of unemployment.    The fact that registered unemployed on airy day at the present time would number nearly 2,000,000 and that the number of insured persons who suffer unemployment in the course of a year is between four and five millions indicates that the       1. basing of holidays on periods of continuous service would exclude a large proportion of the working population.     For a large number, in fact, the question becomes one of the amount in excess of unemployment benefit or assistance to be-paid in respect of a period described as &quot;holiday&quot; instead of &quot;unemployment&quot;.7,     The position is that holidays with pay are found chiefly where employnent is regular and with one employer.    The observations of the Trade Union Congress, like the discussions at Geneva, have dealt with the problem as if , all employment is of this character and, in fact, the Trade Union Congress has avoided questions which are relevant to other circumstances.     Obviously the grant of a general right to one or two weeks holiday with pay would raise difficult questions of cost and administration and, in spite of all that has been written cabout holidays with pay, no attempt has been made to face this problem.8.     IVhile, however, it appears to be impossible to support a proposal for a Draft Convention which would indicate the possibility of legislation, it appears to be undesirable to adopt a purely negative attitude towards the extension of holidays with pay.     I y/ould suggest, therefore, that His Majesty&apos;s Government should support a proposal for a Recommendation which would not imply an obligation to pass legislation.     I attach, for the consideration of my colleagues, a draft reply to be sent to the International Labour Organisation.(intld.)   E. B.15th December, 1955.
b draft   REPLY.His Majesty&apos;s Government rare of opinion that holidays with pay should he provided wherever circumstances permit.     They feel, however, that the consideration which has so far been given to the problem has not taken into account the great problem presented by the Large proportion of workpeople who during the year work for different employers or who are not continuously employed.     It does not appear, therefore, that it would be possible to adopt international regulations in the form of a Draft Convention. His Majesty&apos;s Government, however, would be prepared to support the adoption of o. Recommendation which would heave the object of encouraging all practicable steps to be talc en to extend the provision of holidays with pay and of stimulating further consideration of this subject.
