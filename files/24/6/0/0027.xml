;. Ob j ectioiis to re troces f-ion. of German East Africa to Germany..V  V./-It is clear that public opinion, both in &quot;South Afidea and British East Africa, would be - strongly; oppo eed. - to any handing back of Gorman East Africa./ :So far as South Africa is concerned/ it is neeessary to recall the circumstances in which troops were sent from that country to East Africa.   After the reverse at Tanga in 1914 the British forces in British East Africa were compelled to remain on the defensive. and the Protectorate was for over a year in con-side rable danger of invasion by the Germans,   Owing, to the heavy, demands which we re being made on our military resources by the campaigns in other countries, there was no.prospect of obtaining further assistance for British East Africa except possibly from South Africa.   In spite of the difficulties with which the Union Government were faced in their own country General Smuts engaged in a vigorous recruiting cam-paign, and eventually raised a large force of South Africans.   In his opening speech, delivered to a mass meeting at Gape Town on the 22nd November, 1915, he emphasised: theurgent need of South African assistance in; order, to complete the woric of driving out the German flag from South Africa, and pointed out that South Africa was not protected by the Monroe Dccorine, like America, by distance, like. Australia,, by. forces ofreserve
reserve- power, like Asia, and that therefore it was a special: call to, and the clear duty of, the Union to see territory in Southern Africa inviolate against the designs found in a &quot;Greater Germany&quot;.General Smuts and the South African troops have in fact taken a leading part in the conquest of German East Africa.   The credit and reputation of General - Botha:and his (kivernment &quot;have been staked, though it may he less obviously than in South-West Africa, on the conquest of East Africa, and a conquest followed by a. retrocession would be regarded by public opinion in South Africa as an expensive f si lure, for which it would be very difficult to find adequate :-justification. :His-Majesty1s Government must, in short, having invited the assistance of the Union, abide the result of their action.   It is morally impossible for them to give up German East Africa without obtaining the consent of the Union; and that consent, it: is-safe : to say, would only be given under the pressure of -- necessity.   If given, for whatever reason, it would gravely prejudice the position of General Botha&apos;s Government and thereby endanger the British connection. Further, the other Dominion Governments are watching anxiously our action;: even the surrender to the French of the greater part of the Cameroons has elicited unfavourable comment, and these Governments would resent the evacuation of German East Africa hardly less keenly than the UnionSo far as British East Africa is concerned&apos; there is probably no section of the Empire which in proportion to its numbers and resources has made-greater
greater sacrifice? in connection with the war than the white community of that country.    After years of struggle and disappointment the settlers had recently attained a certain measure of prosperity, but, on the outbreak of war, the majority of the men of military age left their farms and businesses without hesitation and enrolled themselves in the local forces.    Cornpul-sory military service was spontaneously adopted by them at an early date - before indeed,; it had been adopted in this country - their whole weight was thrown into the struggle and, from their knowledge of local condi-tions, their assistance has been of the utmost value. There can be no doubt that they confidently expect that German East Africa, for the conquest of which they have made such heavy sacrifices, will be retained by this oountry.:    Should this expectation not be realized the effect.on the white population would be deplorable, and the difficulties of the local administration, at all times considerable,&apos;.would-be greatly increased.There can be ho.doubt whatever that the return of the Germans to German East Africa would be a very severe blo^ to British prestige among the natives throughout the Protectorates of British East Africa, Uganda and Nyasaland.    The. natives are.&apos; not accustomed to see conquered territory hande d back by the conqueror and the general opinion would be that, whatever we might say, we had been beaten by the Germans.    As there are no white troops in our East African Protectorates and only small native forces,, we depend there largely on prestige:   and should German East Africa revert to Germany we must be prepared for grave unrest among, the natives, involving a reconsideration of The wnolo military policy in our Protectorates and a greatly in-creased expenditure.It
It is also to be borne in mind that there is un-doubtedly a very powerful body of public opinion in this country which, on humanitarian grounds alone, is strongly opposed to the retransfer of the German Colonies to their former owners and, in the case of German East Africa, this opposition is likely to be especially bitter as the British missionary and other prisoners who have recently returned from that country are taking steps to produce evidence with a view to showing the brutality of German methods and the un-desirability of allowing the natives to be subjected to them again.One of these prisoners, the Reverend 1. F-. Spanton Principal of St. Andrew&apos;s College, Zanzibar, gave svi-dence before Sir R. Younger&apos;s Committee regarding the ill-treatment which he and his fellow prisoners had. received and subsequently furnished Memoranda of a more general nature to the Colonial Office from which the following passages are taken:-&quot;The Germans: have shown themselves incapable of ruling the African people, they have treated taem with brutal cruelty and injustice.    The natives have had a foretaste, on more than one occasion, during the last year of what they would have to expect if they were made subject to the Germans when the war is at an end. Gera-an forces have retired before British advance guards, and have, subsequently, again occupied their previous position, as the British fell back upon tneir main body; &apos; when this has happened the natives have been massacred by the returning Germans for having sold food to the English while they occupied the district, and certainly in one case, for Slaving been glad that the English ckae&quot;.And again--     &quot;kany of uhe German askaris andpractically
practically all porters required for transport were re-cruited by. the following simple process.    Parties of soldiers were sent out into the villages (they were generally timed to arrive at night when the people of the village were likely to be caught in bed) to seize all the young men.    /They fastened them together some-what in the fashion of the Arab slave raiders of older days and drove them to the nearest fort.    They were confined in the fort, or, more frequently in a camp, and were told that any attempt to escape would be punished with death;.The porters engaged in transport work were con-si stently treated with the greatest brutality.    When a man fell exhausted under the weight of. his load, he was flogged until he staggered to his feet and stumbled on again..   Those who were too weak to do this were shot as they lay,     For example, one of the German officers with the column retreating from the Ruanda country before-the advancing Belgians, wrote ma private letter:-    &quot;our road is paved with the corpus of the natives we have been obliged to kill&quot;.    This is only a portion of Mr: St anton&apos;s case, and. Mr. St anton is only one of many British civilians who were taken prisoners by the Germans.    \Yhen the whole indictment has been presented to the public it will prove a very serious obstacle to the retrocession of:German East Africa,In this connection it may be added that many of the surrendered German askaris are being enrolled by General dmuts and if we are to hand them back to the tender mercies of their former masters our action will not only be keenly resented by&apos;the &quot;natives, but willprobably
probably be stigmatised as base ingratitude by publio opinion here.It is also necessary to call attention to the competition in armaments which will ensue between the British Protectorates in East Africa and German East Africa if the latter is retransferred at the end of the: /war.    Both the East Africa Protectorate and Uganda are new and - imperfectly developed countries, and it is of the highest importance, not only in their own interests but in those of the Imperial Government that as large a portion as possible of their funds should be devoted to reproductive work, such as the development of com-,: muni cat ions, &amp;c, and that: they should be placed at an early date on a permanently self-supporting basis.   If they are burdened with largely increased military ex-penditure their position will become a difficult one, . and they will: probably.require large grants-in-aid from, the Home Government.    During the present campaign in German East Africa we must already have employed from first to last some 35,000 men, and the transport of troops and stores has occupied a great number of ships which would have been very valuable elsewhere; In the early stages of the campaign British East Africa defended its own territory with difficulty from German attacks and after two and a half years of war the campaign is still unfinished.     In another war, if German East Africa were given back, we should have a still harder task.Then there is the question of the vulnerability of the Uganda Railway which for its entire length of 584 miles runs in proximity to the northern frontier of German East Africa and is therefore specially opento
to attack from that quarter.    The General Staff agree that this is a matter of great importance, and it may-be pointed out that, although many successful attacks were made on the section of the line between Mombasa and Nairobi, with -considerable damage to rolling stoc-k and permanent-way, the injury done was trifling corn-pared with what might have resulted from attacks on the section between Nairobi and Lake Victoria.    In the former section there are no viaducts and no im-portant bridges, but in the latter there are no less than twenty-seven steel viaducts, many of which are of considerable magnitude.;^ If one or more of these were seriously damaged in time of war, repairs would he very-difficult to execute, and the consequences, both from a military and economic point of view, might well be . serious.  .- There are some additional points to whichattention should be called,;:; In- a telegram of the 8th September, 1916 from the Indian Government to the India Office it is stated that &quot;As regards German East Africa, whatever may be its eventual administration, we trust arrangements to admit of Indian emigration on equitable lines may be made&quot;.There is no need to;enlarge on the &apos;serious diffi-culties connected with the emigration of Indians to the Colonies.    Both the Imperial Government and the Government of India have for years been endeavouring to find some solution of the question and, in view of the part played by India during the war, it is more than ever important that a solution should be arrived at as soon as possible,     Thero can be no doubt that the situation would be greatly relieved if an outletfor
for Indian emigration could be found in a country which, as in the Cd.se of German East Africa, is of large ex-tent , is thinly populated, and is in parts apparently suited for Indian Settlement-  -Another point to be borne in mind is that both Belgium and:Portugal-will certobjections to theardocoupation byGermany of territory adjacent to theirs in Africa, as they would in that event be exposed to retaliation from their formidable /neighbour, whose attitude towards them was by no means conciliatory even before the war. --:Finally a reference should be made to the naval aspects of the case.In a memorandum dated 15th September 1916, the Admiralty representative on tho Territorial Changes Committee, Admiral of the Fleet, Sir A. K. Wilson. -stated as follows:-&quot;The German base s in Africa also add ed v ery much to our difficulty of disposing of their cruisers. - The &quot;Konigsberg&quot; managed to keep a considerable number of cruisers watching her for nine months by merely shelter-ing in a river where she could not be got at.    The capture of these Colonies proved to be much more diffi--oult than was expected before the war,   Kiaochao. S&apos;.W. Africa,.Cameroons and/East Africa, all required opera-tions, on a large scale to capture them, and the work is only now approaching completion after two years of war.If these Colonies are given back they will be made into a much more serious threat to our commerce in any future war by becoming bases for submarines as well as oruisers, and keeping such, vessels well supplied withfuel- .
fuel, and .ammunition&quot;.In a&quot;later communication he observed: &quot;It seems to me inconceivable that the German Colonies should be given back to them except as the result of the complete defeat of the alkies(Intld)   V.E.L.14.2.17.
