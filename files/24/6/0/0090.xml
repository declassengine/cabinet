W1R CA3I3IdTDdJYJSOPriCWT op 11021 RAW&apos; mas srien p^odwcpiow o.v yapeoits orhs ahi:IA&quot;3 OPHSR 2F&apos;JT IROJT ORB,(Memorandum bytlao Ministor of, MiMimltlonsTHE PRIME MINISTERSteps are being taken in the Ministry of Munitions to focus and give more effective shape, to the efforts v/hioh have already been made in different directions to develop, for war purposes, certain of the mineral resources.of this country and&quot;of different parts of the Empire.     The acuteness of the shipping position renders additional efforts in this direction morefurgent than ever.I have dealt in a separate note with the iron-ore dopes-its which;exist in dlfferent parts of the country and which ere immediat oly cap able of development, with a view not only to avoiding a. great deal of the; shipment of foreign ores., but with a view to r endoring our large stool and iron extensions more.self-supporting..In addition, wo are&apos; already taking steps to promote an increased output of zinc ore in this country and to develop the output of wolfram in -Cornwall, and we are endeavouring to pro-moto the working of some very valuable ganister deposits in -Durham.I may also say with regard to other metals, such as lead, tin, copper, manganese, and. the utilization of silica rock and sand that the Hate rials department have /obtained very- valuable information and some promising offers.     whilst inmanyof these directions:we may obtain assistance during the War for War purposes, and the pro jects therefore come preperly within the scope of the Ministz-y of Munitions, it is-impossible in the majority of instances to lose sight&apos;of post-war coiisidera-tions. :. . With.a view to rendering our. Information as complete and accurate as possible, and for testing in a sensible and efficient manner the information which is obtained, I suggest. that the Ministry of Munitions &apos; should sot upa Branch associat-ed with the Materials&apos; Department whi eh will be - instructed to make a critical examination of.-the mineral ;and &quot;refractory ro-. sources; of theUnited./kingdom;and to classify them and report -upon&apos;-them.     There are in the service of tho Ministry many men thoroughly competant to assist in this; work,; but I think it will be advisable that the Ministry of Munitions should be authorised to secure the co-operation, so. far as need be, of officers attached to tho./Geographical&quot; Survey as well as under the Department of the Chief Inspector of Mines./
Tlhen immediate action appears to be indicated,, schemes would he submitted to the War Gabinet: in oases where aft or-the-war considerations are particularly involved, but I think it would be a serious omission if we were to fail to make use of the present facilities of the- fcliniatiy of Munitions and of the experience of. the staff it: has gathered together in encouraging end pre meting action ih conns cti on with promising schemes for developing our Home resources.It maybe reported that, with the concurrence of the Admiralty and the Board, of. [Trade, I have : recently: established a Section charged with the duty of promoting., the develepmeht of the shale oil deposits in this ,country; and I am glad to say that in the Scottish; shale oil district a most valuable result has already followed from their efforts,!2he operations of the Ministry.of Munitions h&amp;Te . also involred the development of different ores in various parts of the Empire,- and&quot;I think it should be a subject for discussion at the forthcoming conference with repreSenta-tives of the Dominions whether an Imperial Bureau.of Mines should not be set up in London, with a.view to making avail-able all properly digested and Vorifie(i ijrformation v/ith regard&apos;to the mineral and raw material resources of the Empire, especially as regards those minerals and raw materials which we have found to be essential for the pro-se out ion of the -Jar,2 6th.
