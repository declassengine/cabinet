SECRET.WAP CABINET&quot;.&quot;CEIISOHSHIP OF ; PARLIAMENTARY Q.UFSTI02IS. (Hots by Lord Bobert Cecil)12th February 1917.Prime Minister.I saw Mr,Asouith on Saturday morning about the censor-ship of Parliamentary questions.     He recognised that such a censorship was desirable in itself, provided that the House of Commons would grant it-.     His own action, he said, would depend a good deal on;what;the/Speaker thought.     If the Speaker were ready to establish a censorship at the request of the Leader of the House, he would concur, but:he doubted the; wisdom of pro-ceeding by way of resolution, if that should be the:only method :; by which the censorship could be established.     He thought there would be a disagreeable debate, and that it would do more harm &quot; than good. ,  &apos;    \-        , ^.-r-\V  I saw the Spealter later in :the day, and he said that it would he impossible for him to - establish any censorship without the authority of the House.     He agreed that there were a certain number of members who could only be restrained by a change in the rules, and he fully recognised that Wedgwood1s questions were in the highest degree undesirable.   He thought that he might be able to rule one of then out as being hypcthe-tical, but he admitted that the other would have to be put down if Fedgwoodinsisted.;    He said -th?&apos;.-.t if the House/passed a ,resolution, he/would act upon it, -though he wasnot vary keen about it, and seemed rather to agree with Asquith that the debate would be an awkward one.I remain&apos; of opinion that it v-ould be desirable to establish such a censorship,   But in view of the; Speaker\s and Mr,AsquithTs opinions, I think it would be necessary to have the . appearance;as well &apos;m- the; reality in acting in obedience to the -wishes of the House.I suggest, therefore, that I should try and induce some respected member of the House, like Mr.Samuel Roberts, or Mr.Lawrence Hardy to put a question to the Leader of,the House on the subject, who might then;reply that: he agreed that such a change would be very desirable, but that - . V since it. affected the.unofficial members of the House, he should not like to propose it unless he was;assured that it met /with general-support, and suggest that means should be taken to ascertain; whether, such general support was forthcoming.(Initialled)        R.
