I ONFIDENTI^.   - ftf :;tev;0? Li..,WAR. - CABINET,. - %JP^    --MR. BARNES &apos; MEMORANDUM OF FEBRUARY 5TH&apos;UPON : APulANGFKENTS - -FOR: TJli- TREATMENT . OF . DISABLED. SOLDIERS..Not op bv Sir Edwin&apos; 0crr.wallv &amp;hd Lord&apos; Khendda.Note by gir ECornwall-.&apos;.It is observed;:tbatthe.arrangeiients of thV ^rar C-ff ice . referred to -in the&apos; Memorandum as regards the;&apos;provision of both - in-pati ent: and. out-patlent-&apos; treatment-.- f cr ^discharged: disabled soldiers apply-: only: so-far&quot; as-the&apos; available accom-modat ion-.and- medical staff s.- of:&apos; Military. - Hbspi taps -will from time to time, allow... -. It &quot;is clear; therefore, that;&apos;if M by reason of .any great increase - in - the number ;.of. ;sicji&apos; and wounded serving soldiers - requiring to be treated, the:Military Hospital - accommodation. or staff becomes insufficient.for both -serving men and -discharged: men.; there will&quot; be some curtail- . meat of the provision for the discharged men.&quot;The Memorandum does not indicate what body will in fact provide the-nec ess dry specialist-: -treatment; of the men - whose treatment at - Military ileepitals -would, in such eircumst ancea, be discontinued.     It seeas clear from-Sections -3(.l)( j). and -4(f) of&apos;the Naval and.Military Var Pensions Act,. 1915, that the primary responsibility rests - with the ,Statutory Committee &apos; and the Local Pensions - Committees; -: -and:.:-(.-in--view. of Section&apos; 3 of the Ministry of Pensions Act,1915),- the responsibility to Parliament-&apos; rests with the Minister of -Pensions.    /The liemoran-dum does&apos; not,--however, give any indication as to the measures which the Minister- of Pensions or the Statutory Committee have in contemplation for providing for the contingency, should it . -arise.        &apos;- -Having regard to the uncertainty, as :to whether, to what ext ent, and in - which - localities,-&apos; the \7ar Of fie e arrangement s might,  as above explained, prove insufficient;to satisfy the-total need, it would seem&quot;, impossible for anyone but the *.7ar Office to - organise, in advance, any comprehensive scheme for meeting any such deficiencies should they arise.     If, however, the V7ar Office -are; not to undertake this, it Would seem desirable -that they/should now give -ah undertaking to the Minister of Pensions that they vail give him reasonable notice, in advance, of .any &quot;impending., short age of - accommodation in any particular locality, in order that -.he or the Statutory 0om--mi ttee might have:&apos;-an opportunity /of -:considering what,. if any,, steps could then be taken to supplement the War. Office pro-vision so as to. meet the-.- shortage, whether of accommodation or&apos; of medical staff,-:    - It must be remembered that no responsibility in this respect rests&apos;on; ,the^National Health;Insurance Department, for, . as p o int ed , out in paragr aph 14 , of . Mr. - Earn es &apos;.&apos; memorandum, the provision which is - being-, looked f or from the Insurance /Com-missiopers is limit ed (exc ept as - to- tuberculosis) to general practitisner /treatment&apos;;, and does nof. include specialist and . in-pat lent treatment, - either . or- both of whi ch will frequently - -be required .    /The Insurance; -Commissioners would, ho1;;ever, endeavour to assist the Pensions Minister to the fullest extent in their power in carrying out any arrangements, which he might find, it possible to make to; supplement the--War Office.provision in the.contingency contemplated above.
In line 3 of paragraph 13 of &apos;the&apos;Memorandum the word &quot;pulmonary&quot; should he., omitted, as arrangements made hy the Commissioners are not limited to. cases of pulmonary tuber-ctlosis.I concur in the views... of the Local Government Board,  as set out-&apos; in their. Hote of Pebruary&apos;&apos;&apos;22nd, . with regard to. the last sentence of paragraph 13 of Mr. Barnes&apos; Memorandum.It,. is observed that the Memorandum- deals only. with . Soldiers, not with.Seamen&apos; and. Marines .:.   /unless separate arrangements are. made&apos; for Sailors, iM seems necessary that,&apos; before the scheme.is intimated .to Parliament or the public, st ep s should ha?/ e been t aken to s ecur e that the War Off ice and other&apos;;arrangements. -indicated in; nr. &quot;Barnes * Memorandum should.be made applicable to&apos;them.&apos; ; with - reference, to the last sentence of paragraph 14. of the 1 enorandum, I &quot;may state that the outlines., of the scheme for recouping Approved Societies in respect of &quot;continual expenditure falling upon them by the. payment of sickness and disablement benefits were agreed between the Pensions Minister and myself,. and the proposals were forwarded to the Treasury f or their approval early in February-..&apos;;national Health Insurance Joint Committee,.&apos;  &quot;3rd I a,rch,. 1917.     .    ; .   . .--..&apos;.&apos;&apos;,-. . &quot;   &apos;    .&quot; Note by herd dGiondda. , . .It does .not appear.necessary to offer.any special com-merits from the point of view of - the Local. Government&apos;Boa,r.d on the Pensions Minister.&apos;&quot;s Memorandum,- &apos; --It has been suggested, however, that it would-not. be -desirable to establish separate residential&apos; institutions for the treatment, of incurable cases of tuberculosis, and that it would-be preferable, both -from&apos; - the. practical and -from the   . sentimental standpoint, that -.such ext r a .accommodation .a,s is n ec e s carj&apos; should be ;pr ovid ed in c on j unction,-; wit h exi sting sanatoria,  e..g.. by the erection- of - pavilions or annexes.     .Such an arrangementit is thought, would have the . practical advantage of securing economical administration and the subsequent utilisation of the&quot;-.extra acoommodation for the general public-.     From :the point of view of senti-ment, it is f jit that it is undesirable to /provide separate institutions for. tuberculous patients in the /advanced -stages of the disease,, as the patients would, think that they are merely sent- there to dio, but. that,  if-. the accommodation for these cases forms part of Or is attached &quot;to - definitely cura-tive sanatoria, this impression wi 11, to sOrne -extent;- be r.emo&apos;v ed.:&quot;Local G c v e rnm en t B o ar d -. 22nd February,; 1917,2 Whitehall:Gardens,  S.W. 3rd March, 1917.
