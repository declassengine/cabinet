g AIR BOARD.&apos; REPORT TO THE CABHSDBTSince the 24th of January when the last report was made on the progress of the organization of the Air Board, the personnel of the Naval Air Department and a portion of that of the Military Air Department have moved into the new premises of the Air Board.     The total staff to be accommodated numbers about 2,000 and the conclusion has reluctantly been arrived at that it will be impossible to house it entirely in the Hotel Cecil unless a portion of the block of buildings known as Cecil Chambers and perhaps the bedrooms of the Hotel which had been reserved for the Constitutional Club are taken over..Brig. General D. le G. Pitcher has, on the joint recommendation of the Fifth Sea Lord and the Director General of Military Aeronautics, been selected for the position of Director General of the Technical Department under the Board, and Wing Capt. Groves, R.1T., who has been Assistant Secretary to the Air Board since its creation has been appointed his Assistant. General Pitcher has taken up his post and the process of amalgamation under him of the iTaval and Military Departments which have hitherto dealt with the design of aeronautical material has begun.     Simultaneously the first steps have been taken in the creation of a joint Aeronautical Supply Department under Sir William Weir.The Air Board has held three meetings a week regularly.     It has dealt with a large number of
questions, and notably the following;-(a)   The demand for a constantly improved performance of aeroplanes has made it necessary to adopt for manu-facture in large numbers an engine of about 200 H,P. The choice rested between four designs;   one a modified type of the well-known Hispano-Suiza engine, one known as the 6-cylinder B.H.3?,, and two others, one of 6 and one of 8 cylinders, designed by the Sunbeam Company.The matter was considered hy the Engine Sub-Committee, presided over hy Mr. Dugald Clerk, of the Advisory Committee on Aeronautics, who came to tho conclusion that the design of the 8 cylinder Sunbeam was greatly superior to that of the Hispano-Suiza, and, that of the 6-cylinder engines, the B.H.P. was suitable for adoption,   as a result of their advice important orders are being placed for engines of these two designs.lb)   To take advantage of Canadian manufacturing facilities which are already in existence and as a margin to provide against delays or shortage at home, an order for 1,000 Sunbeam engines of the type referred to above has been placed with the Willys Overland Company which is to manufacture them in Canada^(c)   Numerous applications from Allied Governments for aeronautical material have been under consideration, notably a request from the Italian Government for enormous quantities of the special steels and-&amp;her metals required for aircraft construction.   The quan-tities named are in Some cases double the amounts of the
total British requirements and exceed the whole output of the country.     The Italian authorities have been informed that it is quite impossible to accede to their request.     The steel situation is being reviewed and when the position has been cleared up it will be possible to determine how much can be allowed to Italy.It is understood that having regard in the epinion of the Commander-in-Chief in Stance general priority will be given by the Ministry of Ignitions to guns and aircraft over motor transport and tanks.(Signed)    H. P. Harvey, - ; 17.2.1V
