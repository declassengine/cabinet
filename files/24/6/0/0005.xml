szcrsj &apos; Copy No. i0.&quot;&apos;l./8 2/245.Report &quot;by i,i out. - Col * plunkett,General Staff, Liaison Off i cer b e two en the War Office and Sal on ika on the French attitude towards Greece, and their relations V       to the British Force at Salonika-.The present French attitude towards Greece and the British Force in Salonika appears likely to have, firstly, purely military .results,., and secondly, political and economic effects which may outlast the war.The situation can best be considered under the following two heads; (a) -Military, and (Bj politicalsA. UilitarycFrench attitude towards Greece.      In Salonika the French attitude towards the Greeks has been from the. first studiously irritating and insulting from the time of the occupation of KaraVBurnu Fort a year ago*   Liany unpleasant steps have been taken and generally in a most unpleasant wayeThat the Greeks fully appreciated the French attitude is shown by the following incident.Early in 1916 a senior officer from each of the British, French and Greek armies met to discuss certain matters.   During tiie disoussion the Greek remonstrated with the Frenchman and asked him why the French could not formulate their demands in a courteous manner? as the English always dids when they would be complied with,,. During all last year the same attitude has been maintained&apos;.and the French have neglected no opportunity to show their contempt for, and dislike ofs, the Greeks.    Only recently I noticed a party of civil prisoners, among whom were several priests, being marched through the main, street of Salonika escorted by French V/est African negroes.At Athens last autumn the attitude of the French Minister and the French Admiral towards the Greek CentralGovernment
,-.e/ y&apos;V-.-.M&quot;MM-v^:M:;AA.,-.: Page,2-,Governmont; was identi cel with the behaviour of Sarr-H.il and.his staff at; Salonica.    Small parties of French marines frequently patrolled the main streets of Athens without any apparent object except that of causing annoyance,, and, were only suspended, at the personal request of the/King&apos; to the British Minister,    Indeed the French seemed, to desire-, to make the situation intolerable for the Greeks, though their reasons and.the military advantage - to be gained-from such action were not clear.Possible reasons for French attitude. The following are.prob-abiy the/reasons&apos;, underlying the French hostile attitude to- the &apos;-.-Greeks(a) Annoyance at the Foolish action taken by Admiral du Fournot at Athens and its unfortunate sequel,-(b) The personal wish of Sarrail to keep himself in the --public-- eye, to- draw attention . to Salonika and prevent -A its being.; regarded, as a side show,   m- M: (c) A&quot;po&apos;ssibic&apos;intentionto occupy Greece altogether, as a. counter stroke, to German occupation of Rcumania, MM.: Serbia etc,   -No -military-.-advantage could result from, -this andMit is&apos; not&apos; in accordance with British policyhitherto, o &apos;.&apos;.-: .  &quot; -0   &apos; &apos;Result of the French attitude.The present fee linn;, throughout &apos; Greece&apos; is undoubtedly hostile to the Entente, -though- the.French are disliked more than the British,     This hostility is in a great measure the result.of - the/French bullying attitude   escribed above, In. fact it-.would not be far from the truth to say that we have made Greece hostile,Unless the -French, rttitu.de changes,  it is cuite possible thate-war. will result and; the ; situation which !would then-arise would not be favourable to us,   In-the course, of conversation Lieutenant-General Milne expressed the opinion that&apos; war with Greece would inevitably result from a continuance of. the : pre sent . ],;o 1 icy.M
Result of war with Greece...  \; Is war with Greece desired? The Entente has nothing -1o gain- thereby, for friendly Greeks have already joined the Venezelists,/and if the Royalist Army took the field against us, we should lose on the deal.The prospect of being able to defeat decisively the Royalist forces and thus remove the threat to the rear of the Salonika Army, before it can be attacked, is small. The Greeks are excellent marchers, the country is difficult and undeveloped, and guerilla warfare would inevitably result Our forces might well be drawn into a position from which no decision could result and from which retreat would be . dangerous.For such operations a new army would be required; unless the Salonika Army is to run the risk of being attacked while seriously depleted in strength.- - sPolicy to be followed.:        Blockade by sea is always our most effective and most economical weapon against Greece,, and by means of it she can be forced at any time to comply with our demands.  .    Blockade should be used unsparingly, and not be removed on the first complaints about lack of food etc    j The Greek people should be made to realise clearly that they are in our power, even if they have to suffer in the process,,The concentration in the Peloponnesus should be maintained until the/situation definitely changes, and ocular proof, repeated at intervals, should alone be relied on as to the presence of men and material in the Peloponnese. Assurances from any Greek source whatsoever are valuelessIt. should, alwaysbe remembered that, excepting the yenezelists,: the/whole Greek nation is&apos;now hostile to the Entente.-:&quot;-&quot;/:-V:-&apos;v .       . &apos; , B. Political.
Page 4c&quot;B.. Polit i oal *:From the first days of the Allied occupation of Salonioa, Sarrail; and the Frenoh:/havs apparently laid themselves out to impress on che Greeks that he and the: French are supreme at&apos;Salonioa ^and the British subordinate to them in all respects., e .This.attitude has &quot;been maintained: during the past year and has fended to become more accentuated- as forces of other nationalities have.. come to Salonioa. -The:following incidents sufficiently illustrate the a ; above statement.     A short time ago the British applied for the use of a Greek Customs Shed at Salonioa,-     Sarrail refused the applieation on the ground that the Shed was being used by the Greeks and was therefore not availableu.  A few days later some French native troops were lodged in the shed, and it was learnt privately from a French source that Sarrail had used strong; language and said that he was not going to have the English near the place -Recently- a.British motor car, carrying an officer in uniformwas driving, through .Salonioafollowed by a French car.     A police control on one of the main roads stopped the ears, ordered the British car to turn down a... side street and then allowed-the French&quot;car to pass.Salcnica is the -Aast rather than Jurcpe, and such incidents as the above are noted and remembered.At Athens;last Autumn the attitude of the French&apos; Admiral and of, certain Members of the French Legation:in    ^v-v-regard to the control of the Piraeus harbour and of certain -Greek Government Services, was identical withy that-described;
Page 5,above, the desired object being apparently the complete domination of Greecei       The adverse political and economic effects likely to result from acquiescence on our part were pointed out to the Foreign Office by His i/Iajesty&quot;; s Minister, and certain proposals put forward by him were approved in London and agreed to in Paris..     These proposals were made with a view to opposing the increase and extension of French influence, but have never been carried out,,Though damage to British prestige may not be a matter of immediate military importance, the following facts should not be lost sight of:- the oalonica. front, the town and port are under the French, the Piraeus is under a French Admiral and a French General is at the head of the International Control at Athens, while all ships leaving Piraeus and Patras immediately enter the sea area controlled by the French.4(Signed)   lie Flunkett.;Lieut, -Colonel, General Staff110,2,17
