ott for the information of the war cabinet from secrsl. first sea lord.mawat PTiTTry TN relation to mercantile shipping-the experience gained of the effect up to date of the so-called blockade of the allied coasts by submarines and Hiihes is sufficient to show that an immediate reconsideration of the; general strategy,of a the allies is hecessary so far as sea transportation is concerned, andv in the opinion of the board of admiralty, it is apparent that the menace can only be met by a radical change in the policy with regard to the oversea expeditionary forces.;vthe statements attached hereto give in detail, for the information of the war oouncil, the results of the enemy submarine campal gn to the present time, and the measures taken and being taken by the admiralty to oppose it, together with the mat erial which is at their disposal for the purpose.it is evident from the figures given that the materiel available is quite inadequate for efficient protection of both transports and other merchant shipping in all of. the various areas over which the attack is spread;   consequently the merchant shipping is suffering, since transports and nava.1 aid military supply ships must be afforded adequate protection at all costs.there appear to be only two alternatives, viz:-;&apos;(a) to accept the serious losses that are now being incurred, and which may probably increase in the near future if the present system be maintained.(b) to reduce the number of transports, supply ships, etc., requiring escort, so that more adequate protec-tion may be given to ships bringing supplies to this country and to our allies.the board of admiralty is of opinion that, in view of the present rate of loss of mercantile tonnage, it-is imperatively necessary that steps should at once be taken to effect the second of these alternatives.^; the only practicable method of doing so is by reducing our commit-ments for tonnage for the supply of the various expeditions in salonica,.: egypt, east africa and mesopotamia.-1;-;     joonsiderat ion wi 11 show that the first alt ernative is not practicable, since the result sooner or later must be that many of the ships now used for the supply of the overseas armies will become absolutely necessary for bringing general supplies to the allied countries and must be diverted to this employment     this will automatically necessitate reduction of some or all of the expeditionary forces,:    tt would be wiser to face the situation now an8 make ail pacticable reductions at once, rather than to wait upon force majeure and be compelled to provide tonnage for moving the troops at a time when the shortage of tonnare for general purposes would already be acute. -- 1 -.      If?1
The advantages of immediate action on these lines are very great from the naval point of view.    A reduction of transports, supply ships, etc., for oversea fordes would ehahle a numbfcoi^li^t cratt suitable for:anti-submarine warfare and escort duties to fce brought back to home waters from abroad, and thus would undoubtedly reduce the losses of merchant shipping, whilst the transport s, etc., thus set free would considerably increase our avaxlable tommge^ for the import of supplies and form a se^f f * arrust the    -unavoidable losses that will in the meantime be incurred.In Appendix VI it will be seen that no less than 333 merchant steamers of a tonnage aggregating- over 1? millions are employed in supplying the three principal oversea expeditions.The losses of merchant ships from mines and    t submarines between the 1st and the 16th February inclusive are given in Appendix III, and also the average losses for each &quot;month from October, 1916, to January, 1917.     The figures are given separately for &quot;British&quot;, &quot;Allied&quot; and &quot;Neutral1&apos;.    The total losses between the 1st and the 16th February amounted to 243,000 tons.    If they continue at the same rate, the losses for the whole month of 28 days will be over 425,000 tons.It must further be remembered that neutral trade was to a considerable extent held up during, the period under review, and, therefore, the losses for this period among neutral ships are not so heavy as they might have been had the trade continued without interruption.    In addition it is certain that the numbers of hostile submarines will increase month by month, while the longer hours of daylight in the coming Spring ana Summer will greatly facilitate their operations.   &quot;The estimate of 435,000 tons for the month may, therefore, be substantially exceeded in following months unless some remedial measures are taken -y at once.... The Admiralty can hold out little hope that there will be any reduction in the rate of loss until the number of patrol vessels is largely increased, or unless new methods which have been and are in process of being adopted result in the destruction of enemy submarines at a greater rate than that at which they are being constructed and put into service.    On this latter point it would not be safe to anticipate any appreciable b enefit during the next two or three months.It will, therefore, be seen from an examination of the figures given that the position is exceedingly grave, and it is a matter for the consideration of those responsi-bie for the import of food, munitions, etc, to this country, and for the supply of necessities to our allies for the prosecution of the war, to determine how long we: can continue to carry on the war if the losses of merchant shipping continue at the present rate.    We are already faced with a situation of great gravity in regard to the supply of coal to France and Italy....   Bi order to reduce the losses the only immediate possible remedy is to increase by every means in our power&quot; m^^S of cFaft used for the protection of traderoutes and approaches to land and to harbours.   EveryfwiaJie.vessei the P^ent system is now employed onthese duties, as will presently be shown, and vessels have
whenever possible been taken temporarily from other Srtfnt services to cope with the present emergency. SSeroTvesels available for anti-submarine duty ca  2S5 only be increased if further sacrifices are made in other directions.Before going into these points in detail-, it is necessary to state the general principles adopted by the Admiralty for the safe Sonduct of our trade and to examine the &quot;protection which we are able to afford to merchant ships on the principal approaches to the British Islands.    These principles are as followsThe trade is ordered to approach and leave home waters on the following general routes -(a) A route round Ushant to Bay of Biscay ports.(b) A route between West and South-west from the Scillies.(c) A route Westward from the South of Ireland.(d) A route Westward from the North of Ireland.(e) A route Westward from the Orkneys.(f) A route Eastward from the Shetlands for theprotection of Scandinavian ships.Each main route comprises alternatives, so that when submarines are found to be operating on one line the trade : may be diverted to another.    This diversion cannot, however, be effected quickly, owing to -(I)   The necessity of informing all vessels inward and outward bound;(2)   The necessity of moving ail the patrols during a night when there is hot much moon.From these main positions of arrival and departure the trade passes close along the North and West toasts of France, the South Coast of England, the West Coast of England, the South&apos; Coast of Ireland, the North Coast of Ireland, and the East Coast of England.Appendix I gives first the number of patrol vessels of all descriptions which it is considered are required to maintain efficient protection to trade and to act offensively on each of the main routes mentioned, and, secondly, the number available.   The situation is considered only as far East as St.Catherines on the South Coast of England and the Orkneys to the North, except the route for Scandinavian trade between Norway and Lerwick.     The matter is not complicated by touching upon the protection required upon the East Coast itself, althouph unfortunately the situation on that Coast is by no means set isfactory, owing to lack of patrol craft.The footnote in Appendix T shows the vessels which it has been necessary to divert from other duties in an endeavouE to make up thecfe^ficiency existing at the danger points; the objections to taking these vessels from their proper duties are also stated.It will, therefore, be seen that there is a present shortage of about 240 trawlers and 60 destroyers or other supporting vessels on the Coastal Patrol, ana of about 60 Sloops or similar ships for the Ocean Patrol, on tjie numbers
necessary to rive adequate protection-to merchant shipping round our coasts.    This allows only for protection to a distance of 250 miles to sea, and the deficit does not include the vessels of different classes diverted from various other services in.home waters, from which they can ill be spared, nor is any protection afforded at present in Canadian or west Indian waters.There is, of course, a large number of new vessels fo&quot; patrol duties under construction, and Appendix II shows the increase in available patrol vessels that may be expected month by month up to the 1st June, A forecast is made of the losses that experience shows may also occur during this period.   The net gam m new vessels is indicated, but experience shows^that the completion of new destroyers and other small craft does not at present result in any appreciable increase in the number of vessels available to work offensively against submarines, or defensively for the protection of trade, as under- existing conditions they are practically al absorbed in providing escorts for the additional transports and munition&quot; ships which the constant increase in the Army in France and elsewhere necessitates.Appendix IV shows the number of Destroyers, Torpedo Boats and Patrol Boats that are now employed in the English Channel for escort duties.   Possibly, with a reduction of transports proceeding to the Mediterranean and requiring escort out to sea, some of the Devonport Flotilla would become available for general anti-submarine duties, but none of the others can be spared from their immediate duty of keeping safe communication with France.Appendix V gives the number of Destroyers, Sloops, and Trawlers employed in the Mediterranean on wofck which consists largely in the protection and escort of the transports and other vessels required for the maintenance of the forces at Salonica, Egypt and Mesopotamia.The vessels in Appendix V are the only ones which could be drawn upon to supplement further the anti-submarine patrols in home waters, if their present duties were no longer required.   Not ail of these could be with -drawn in any case, but sufficient would be available to effect a substantial improvement at homo.The only means by which they can be made avails le is the reduction of the military forces employed in the East, and the manifest military and general objections to such a course being taken at this stage of the war must be balanced against the much heavier losses of merchant shipping that will occur unless the strategy be altered, and against the disadvantages of keeping  so many merchant vessels, all specially open to attack and requiring continual escort, engaged in the supply of these military forces. Jx &quot; j&apos;     ,,The ??ard of Admiralty therefore feel compelled to draw the attention of the War Council to the position that is developing in consequence of the submarine campaign of the enemy.On the general question of anti-submarine measures, it may be said that up to the present no complete and practicable cure, for the submarine menace has been, or- 4 -
-5s likely to be, discovered short of the destruction of the bases, which is obviously a military measure of great magnitude.:Shortj however, of a complete cure, much can be, and is b ein.?, done to bring about the destruction of submarines and make their enterprises as dangerous, unpleasant and unproductive as possible.The following are some of the principal anti-submarine measures which have recently been taken, mainly in home waters(i) Officer Instructors for Defensively Armed Merchant Ships have been instituted.   These instructors go for voyages and train the : v    Masters and crews. .: -(ii) Extensive smoke trials have been carried out and a large quantity of smoke -apparatus ordered, which is now being delivered and issued, together with instruct ions for its use.   Further experiments are being made..(iii) The Auxiliary Patrols in the.English Channel have; ,boen strengthened and re-organised on a definitescheme which provides a protected Lane up which the traffic passes.(iv) Further Air Stations have been established on -the South Coast and Air Patrols started.(v) More Decoy Ships have boen taken up or ordered.:V&quot;. (vi) Schemes for using submarines to hunt submarines -   have been prepared and are being carried out.(vii) A scheme for escorting a Merchant Ship with a submarine has been prepared and will shortly be;;:    put into practice.(viii) Bomb Howitzers are on order, firing bombs which burst under water and are intended for use against enemy submar ine s when submerged.   All the Gun-Mounting firms and Woolwich are endeavouring to produce a new and improved design.(ix) Further experiments with Hydrophones for local-ising ene^y submarines are being pressed on. They are now proceeding independently at Hawkcraig, Harwich and Portsmouth.  Promising results have been obtained and considerable orders have been placed for hydrophones. h.(x) Hunting Patrols of T.B.D!s. have been instituted.(xi) Many more guns have been obtained from various sources for Merchant Ships.. (xii) Large orders have been placed for mines of an improved type, and minelaying in German waters is proceeding as rapidly as the delivery of efficient mines admits.(signed) J.R.JSLLICOE, 21/2/17.

APPENDIX 1* (Continued). -OCEAN PATROL.Up to the present, Merchant Ships have been sunk by Submarines to a distance of 250 miles from the Coast.The range of the Submarine activity is bound to extend beyond this, but for our calculation 250 miles is assumod to be the limit to which protection need &quot;be provided outside tho Coastal routes.For effective patrol of the ocean routes Patrol Sloops are necessary, and experience has shown that a beat of 30 miles is the utmost area one vessel oan usefully patrol.    ;/.yV-:Consequently, for tho 5 Ocean Routes, commencing where Coastal Patrol terminates, a total of 40 vessels - must continually be on patrol.To maintain this force a total of 70 vessels &apos; ; is required.StMMARY OP VESSELS (A) NECESSARY, (B) AVAILABLEFOR OCEAN PATROL.
