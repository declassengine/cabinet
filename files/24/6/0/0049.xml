Use of the English Quay at Salonica

M.01926

The Secretary of the Admiralty presents his compliments to Colonel Hankey, and begs to call attention to the enclosed copies to telegrams which have been exchanged between the Admiralty and the Transport Officer at Salonica, with reference to the use of the English Quay at Salonica by the British Army. The telegram to the Transport Officer was sent in accordance with information communicated by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Paris, in his telegram of 15th instant, No. 113.

It will be seen that the unrestricted facilities, which are considered necessary for the British Army, have not been granted by General Sarrail, and in these circumstances it appears necessary for the matter to be again submitted to the War Cabinet in order that further representations may be made to the French Government, with a view to the recommendations of the Transport Officer being carried out.

The Quartermaster General concurs with Their Lordships in the matter being brought again before the War Cabinet as one of immediate and urgent importance.

Sarrail has informed French Government that portion of quay reserved for British Army is not so far encumbered with goods for civil population and that English base has therefore all facilities for discharging on quay. He further states that if British Authorities request refers to eventual occupation of central building of Greek Custom House which is specially fitted up and constitutes vital organ of Greek Custom House Administration he cannot accede thereto pointing out that 2 buildings on quay taken from Greek Custom House were ceded to British on 30th December latter has therefore 3000 square metres covered sheds as compared with 1444 square meters at disposal of French Army whose burdens are double. Request immediate report on present position.
