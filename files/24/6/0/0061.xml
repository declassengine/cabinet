&apos;. Memorandum; by Admiral Grant on the Progress of Xer chant Ship-V.:. building during 1916 .Table-:-.(1) shows the tonnage available for oversea trade, at the,beginning cf:the war and. at: the beginning and end of 1916.Table (2) gives further details for 1916 which.are also -shown on the diagram.During 1916 the new tonnage completed was only &amp;ufficient to make good one. third of the. loss in that year; due. to des-gbruction of vessels by. the enemy added to ordinary marine accidents . .&apos;Xy::7X&apos;y:^C:f:.\&apos;:/y^-J-XX\XX::. In the first months of. 1916 the losees due to enemy action averaged 77,100 tons gross per month, of vessels over 1000 tons gross against an average of 144,400 tonsgross per month for the last three; months of the year      The recent increase in submarine activity: indicates:&apos; an even, higher, rate .;. : for 1917 and It.-is possible this; may.-,be-.-something like: &apos; ...  200,000 tons per month or;- say, 2: 500:000 tons for the year, &quot;nc west rate of new construction before the war, with ample    .. laboux .     -    and material and only normal Ifaval programmes appro ached 2,000,000: tons while in 1916 it was less than 500,000 tons. -&apos; H-^^- -;^xX/- .&apos;There has been considerable improvement in the rate of. new construction &apos; during the last few months,. the output in. the four quarters of the year having been 83,000;  : 97 -000, 95,0.00 &amp; 198,000 tons respectively.;     Even, therefore, if the present rate of Naval constructionis maintained, the output of &quot;y merchant tonnage for 1917 should show a considerable increase. This tonnage, moreover; will be mainly of a cargo carrying type and so be-better, adapted to the immediate requirements of the country.;- - Several points in. Merchant.Shipbuilding which seemed to the Admiralty, to be essential have been gradually brought into being,;y Amongst these are the building of Standard ships: of two oi: three types to Government order,the construction of : cargo vessels only, the.prompt filling of all vacant berths .and the;allocation of slips to the best advantage.     Other minor points; are still being worked out-. ;One of the Admiralty&apos;s principal points still, however, V ..remaihs.,unacoopted//the introduction of a f actor .of saf ety - :- yagainst underwater injury by fitting additional watertight -;: bulkheads.     The necessity for this has been represented again in:connection with the building of Government Standard vessels. &apos;y-     The development of building merchant vessels to direct Admiralty order for war purposes is shown by the construction of Oilers, Trawlers and certain other vessels.The purchase of cargo vessels fron Neutrals and ethers and the utilisation, of the shipbuilding resources of the Oversea Dominions;has been placed, practically, in the hands of the Shipping- Controller. . &apos;A Director of Shipyard lo,bour has been appointed with a view to obtaining better results from labour. y -Thei\
\/by::/]-&apos;::byyj^ 2The output of Merchant Tonnage is affected hy the;: following considerations:-(1)   The placing of Admiralty Orders.     In placing these their effect on merchant shipbuilding is considered, especially in yards laid out for building merchant :   hulls and engines.     The engines of naval vessels, require more   work and, having priority, place the simpler merchant engine behind tho dates required to meet the launch of the. hulls.V-;.&apos; (2)   The prompt filling of slips by Standard Vessels may: make it difficult to ensure slips are available to meet the requirements of future Admiralty programmes, so that it becomes necessary to make arrangements well in advance for laying down Admiralty; vessels - on slips vacated by others, if yards and slips are: suitable. ; -. :F;\;:;FF\.;(3)   The supply of steel.     Approximately one ton of steel . is requirod to construct two tons of cargo steamers, some addition being required for engines, for work--;;-.; ing stocks and for preparing vessels to follow on. v  In view of the limited amount of steel available, the shortage of iron ore and the importance of &apos;/;:.;-. increasing the output of cargo tonnage, it is sub-mi t ted that it should now be considered whether the :   .     Munitions Dept. cannot do with less steel for munitions in favour of; merchant cargo tonnage.. (Signed)   A.E.A. GRANT.10/2/17Rear Admiral,
