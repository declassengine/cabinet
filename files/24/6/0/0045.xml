Memorandum on Prench Coal Supplies IV. &quot; &quot; Italian   &quot;        &quot;I. Copy of Letter from Shipping Controller Oth P ebruary, 1917Dear Sir Maurice Hankey,In accordance-with arrangements made at the Cabinet Meeting last night I now enclose a cummary showing, the French and Italian coal position.I would like the War Cabinet to understand that the British Government have lived up to their promises.     Our obligation is -co supply franee with&quot; sufficient tonnage to lift 260,000 tens coals per month and this we have done. The l*rench have to f ind the ir own shipping f or the balance, for which they have stetc&amp;rs running under the Ersnoh flag as well as chartered British and If eutral tonnage.The main causes of the French running short of coals have been congestion in their own port3, disappearance of neutrals and embargoes.Hith rs^ard to Italy we have also fulfillstf all promises.The obligation of the British Government originally was to give sufficient tonnage to carry 50,000 pet month at Blue Book rates.The Italians had to provide the balance of the tonnage but when they got behind for Similar reasons to those indi-cated for France, we helped them further by giving an additim-al 180,000 tons in December/January and a tether:75,000 tons for shipment during this month.The Prime Minister promised the Italian Commission, which catBhere, to endeavour to induce Prance to give up 100,000 tons but this the French refused to do.     In addition to this loss they only succeeded in getting 57,000 new neutral tonnage instead of the 100,000 for which they hoped, showing a deficit on what they hoped to get of 143,000 tons.To help in the difficulty the Admiralty are arranging to give up about, 50,000 tons mainly by reduction of Uaval stocks of coal which will still leave a shortage of about 93,000 tons.The Transport Department is looking into matters further to 3ee if it can secure more tonnage,I hope the War Cabinet will realise that, a^ above indi-cated,. the Briti sh Government have carried out what wa3 under-taken, by them.Yours faithfully, (Intld.)

7 III. Memorandum on French/ Ooal; Supplies.&apos; -v^ The French have stated that their total requirement so far as imports of British coal is concerned is 2,000,000 tons a &quot;month.     During the last - three months of1916, they imported. 4,738,000 tons, and in the four weeks of January 1,203,0.00 tons.;: - Altogether the total deficit for Prance over the Period of the last 19 weeks is 25;3.Of,this total import the British Government have made themselves &apos;responsihle for the importation only of an incon-siderable fraction, and they! have not;&apos; in. any way undertaken the responsibility of making good the whole- Prench requirement.In accordance v/iththe/arrange meats notified to the     &quot; Commission;--Internationale -. dev--Revitaillement: on the 27th June, 1916,: the; Admiralty, undertook to carry 190,000 tons of coal a month for the&apos;French ..Railways,-. and 20,000 tons a month for the French Ifavy.     The figure of 190,000 tons for the French Railways i3 the estimated carrying capacity of 41 vessels, and in practice this nucaber of vessels has been given, though -; the actual cargoes carried have pro Ted rather less,&quot;It should be added with reference to the figure of 2,000,000 tons a month, that during the visit of Monsieur &apos; Her riot on 4th and 5th January, he put forward a reque st for the shipment to France on British ships of 17000,000 tons of co al in order to restore the diniinished stocks in Prance. The shortageof shipping, as well as the physical impossibility of receiving the ;extra -quantity; through-the ports, made it necessary to refuse this request al-cogether.IY. Memorandum on Italian Goal Supplies.\:The Italians have stated that Italy must import monthly an absolute minimum of;800,000 tons.     They stated at the International; Shipping Conferance;that tlie tomis^e actually employed was - only sufficient -for the importati on of 465,000 tons:a month, thus leaving a permanent deficit of 340,000 ; tons a month.     As a&apos; result of the: discussion AJhich took place at the Conference, it was agreed that on immediate effort^ must, be made to increase the Italian coal shipments during: February7by 275,000;tons. ;   Before dealing uith the measures which wero taken to pro vide/ this increase, it is important that the previous history should be borne in mind.The Transport Department he,ve undertaken to carry 50,000 tons of; coal a: month atA&quot;Biue - Book rates.:;In addition, they have promised to make. good to the Italians,any loss in coal imports caused by the diversion of Italian ships return-ing to the United kingdom to Spain to load ore for: this; Country.     The co al for which the Admiralty are responsible, in.&apos;accordance:-with this pledge, does not, of course, affect the total amount carried into Italy,    :Apart from the amount ; imported to make good the loss of coal through diversion to&apos;-.&apos;--&apos;-&apos;--ore,-.His&apos;Hajesty1 s. Government are only.responsible permanent-&apos;&apos; ly for carrying 50,000 tons of co al a mouth. -:In December last, however, further appeals were re-eeived from Italy as to the state of their&apos;coal supply.     The AcLmir alty then und er t o ok to -furnish a ddi ti onal: ve ss a Is to enable them to :ship-: about 160,000 e:rbra tons of coal in addition to the monthly supply of 50,000 already being&apos;;;;;;-^:;&apos;-;;v. furnished
furnished to them hy the Admiralty under the&apos; arrangement already described.       In order to supply the additional;&apos; tonnage to carry 180,000 tons, the Admiralty were obliged to take the following extreme steps:- .(a)        To divert Atlantic Liners to the Mediterranean before they proceeded to America to load, thereby a&apos;;; diminishing.&apos;; the imports of Kunitions and wheatto thi3 Country, t: the amount of the extra coal -&apos;a- carried to the I. editor ran ean . ^//&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;^&apos;a:;/;-:;:(b).        To reduce supplies to the liaval Depots in-the Mediterranean, thereby considerably- diminishing-the stocks for the Fleet. :    .(c) To divert - certain Neutral Vessels which had :. jefcu chartered f ::r the- importation of &quot;Theat.(d) To reduce the supplies of coal for the Egyptian State Railways, . &apos;      &apos;h/      &apos;To return to the question of providing the 275,000 tons of ccs,l -:which&apos;- it --. was agreed at ;the International Shipping Conference to provide for Italy.    The scheme was that the Admiralty should supply the - ships to carry.75,000 tons of coal, that 100,000 tons should be carried by the Italians through the 1&apos;eutral ships allotted to them, and that the Prench - Government should be asked to divert:ships to carry tbe remaining 100,000 tons.       The Admiralty have aircady.made arrangements for the 75,000 tons,.for which Kin La j esty 1 s C-overnmen t und ertook the reoponoibil ity., but -- t in.; order to do so they have had tc divert to the Mediterranean-Liners for India, which under the ordinary regulations for  ./safety would,have proceeded to that Country by the Cape. The   effect of this has been to displace a certain amount of. cargo which would normally have been carried to India,&apos;/and, more important still, has exposed the ships diverted to the increased risks of Submarine attacks, owing to their having to proceed through the Mediterranean.   --&apos; ,   &apos;  &apos;It is Understood that of, the 100,000 tons which was to be carried as a result of arrangements made by the Italian Government, .shipping has only been provided, for. 57,000 tons, and the Itench have stated that it is quite out of the question for them to carry the 100,000 tons -which they were asked to do, so that there is a def.eeit of&apos;. 143,000.     The Transport Department are now trying to ship a further 50,000 tons, but this is at&apos;the cost of Naval stocks,/ and/ involves , taking a . considerable risk.     There Would, : therefore; appear to be-another/.93,000. tons&apos;:which&apos;-the. Italians urgently, need and for which no. arrangements; appear ;\ to be in sight..^:/;:-hv//:/:.&apos;/-:&apos;&apos;-        - - -&apos;v.?^&apos;-;&apos;/hh^&apos;.h\.vh^-ov^-::V The promises in Pec ember to help up to an extra 180-, 000 and in January.up to a further 275,000&quot;were limited to the immediate assistance, and did.&apos; not .include any continuing monthly obligations .&apos;. It i&apos;s clearhowever, that,-apart from continued assistance, there is bound- to.-.he&apos; a large: \ deficit every month.
