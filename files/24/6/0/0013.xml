W,I attach a Summary of Information concern-ing the forces at Salonika during the month of January 1917,   Two sketch maps are attached.(Sd) G.F. Milne, Lieut.-General,Commanding-in-Chief,British Salonika Fore e.G.H.Qi, Salonika,4th February 1917,
BRITISH   SALONIKA   FORCESummary of Information , 1st - - 3Ist January3 1917.;1, General Situation. ;The general situation as regards the -disposition -of the various armies covering SALONIKA is shown on . attached/sketch map and . is as f oHows ; : -- The British hold with 6 divisions/ less 1 &quot;brigade at KATERINI3 the front from the mouth of the STRUM to the VARDAR river, a distance of 90 miles.     From the VARDAR to SOKOL, a distance of 40 miles, the line is held by one French division, a Greek detachment of two regiments and 2. Serbian divisions.   West of SOKOL as far as the &quot;PRESPA. lake, a distance of 35 miles, is the area in which the recent fighting for the capture of MONASTIR has taken place and this part of the line is held by 4 Serbian divisions, 5 French divisions, 1 Italian division and 2 Russian brigades.   The newly arrived French divisions are also being directed out to this front.West of Lake PRESPA there are small mixed detach-ments, and further west Italian troops hold a line from KORITZA to the Adriatic Sea.It will thus be seen that from t ho sea to SOKOL, a distance of 130 miles, the front is held by 9 divisions, while on a front of 35 miles in the MONASTIR area there are at present 11 divisions in the line.while; two more are on their way there.The estimate of the enemy?s forces opposite the allied front here is as follows

Heavy rains and falls of snow have greatly impeded all movements; the STRUMA during the greater part of the month being 2 to 3 feet above its normal level, and beth the STRUMA. and VARDAR Valleys being flooded.On the 16th Corps front Yeomanry and infantry patrols have been constantly active and several encounters with strong enemy patrols have taken plaoe.On the morning of the 3rd January 2 companies of tho 1st Suffolks supported by 2 companies of the 2nd Northumberland Fusiliors (34th Brigade) successfully raided KJUPRI capturing 29 Bulgars, our casualties being 2 wounded. On tho nig&amp;fc -&amp;f tho 8th January, near JJEOHORI, a patrol of the 80th Brigade drove back a Turkish patrol, killing 5 and capturing one. Two patrol encounters near KAKARASEA accounted for twenty enemy casualties. On the night of the 16th January a Turkish party about 100 strong rushed one of my small advanced j^sts at ^ImSHDRA and, although this place was at once rcoccupied:, the enemy succeeded in capturing one Lowis gun and 8 men.   On anether occasion N.W. pf BARAXLI DZJMk superior enemy forces drove in one of my patrols,cutting
cutting off ono officer and eleven men.     Several other small patrol fights have occurred in which we have on every occasion proved successful.-On the 12th Corps front on the night of the 5th -January. BULUMAC and neighbouring villages N.E. of Lake Doiran were occupied and held during the night by detachments from the 65th Brigade.     AKINDZALI EAST,, an enemy redoubt 1,500 yards S, of AKINDZALI, 2 woods S, of AKINDZALI WEST and part of AKINDZALI; WEST were occupied on the morning of the 6th, thi s operat ion being as si sted by a demonstration made by the 8th Mounted Brigade -towards BREST.       A counter-attack from GEVZEKLI was stopped by our machine gun:fire.     The 47th Squadron R-.P.C. co-operated by dropping bombs in several fully &apos; manned hostile trenches.   - The Bulrjars were seen to suffer:considerably and several prisoners were taken.   On ,the. .13th and 14th January the 22nd Division suecessfully carried out wire cutting and bombardment of the enemy&apos;s trenches in the MACUKOVO salient, the removal of many hostile casualties being subsequently observed.     At the same time during a demonstration by the GOth divisional artillery, AKINDZALI was entered and dug-outs and defence . destroyed,. .The trouble caused by Greek deserters in CHALCIDICE referred to in last month&apos;s summary has now been dealt: with effectually. &apos; :On 2nd January one of my signal posts on the BESIK LAKE was molested by some of these deserters and I thereupon despatched 4.squadrons/ of yeomanry to drive all the deserters in that area southwards where they fell for the most part into the. hands of Cretans:and Gendarmerie sent out by the Greek-Provisional Government.  -
Move s. At the beginning of the. month the 60th Divi si on (lessone brigade) proceeded to the 12th Corps area and is now disposed as follows:-181st Brigade holds the line from AIIBUSALIK to SURLOVO.180th Brigado in Corp s re serve *179th Brigade still remains in the KiTSBINI district.Aviation. ;;    In spite of the general activity shown by tho enemy1 s&quot;; airoraft in bombing villages and camps on both Corps fronts, our aoroplones havo been most successful both in &apos; oorial combats and in bombing raids.    On tho 5th January HUDOVO was bombod by IE machines: $ large bombs wore seen to burst in tho railway station, sheds and dumps, and fires woro soon to start.     Ono of our maohinos was foroed to descend near - GUBVOUEIil, but the pilot set fire to it. Other successful raids were mado on PULJOVO, DRAIvIA and RAZOiJIVOSb      One maohine ^failed to roturn after a raid on ; DRAM on the: 27th January and another, whilst on reoonnais-sanoOf was forced to land behind the enemy&apos;s line..Three Gorman aeroplanes have be on brought- down during the month in air combatSu..:Of these machines one was taken . intact and another was only slightly damaged, while on each occasion the pilots and observers were captured-The Royal Haval Air Service has also greatly assisted by carrying out reconnaissances and bombing raids, a particularly successful raid being made on the 6th January when the road and railway bridgos at KULBiiE BURGAS were bombod.&quot;&apos;   3 *   liino s of Defence in the Bri t i sh Are a.The various entronchod lines which have boon prepared on the British front are shewn on the attached map *oh
On both the STRUMA and DOIRAN fronts advanced lines of defence have been made.  Behind them the main line on the STRUMA front runs along the river line, from the BUTKOVO lake to DOIRAN along the foothills, and from DOIRAN lake to the VARDAR river runs from the lake through VLADAJA and along the ridge through SMCL.

Behind these there are second lines of defence made by each Corps and a retired line is in process of completion running from the north of the TAHINOS lake through NIGRITA BEROVO - LAHANA - KURKUT to the ARDZAN lake.     West of KURKUT two lines exist in order to give additional strength to the defences in case of a strong attack down the VARDAR valley.

In the event of the French troops West of the VARDAR being driven in, a position at VARDINO south of KARASOULI is now in process of completion and will cover the left flank of the British force should it have to conform to any movement of the French

In the rear of the whole are the old SALONIKA defences.

4. Allied operations.

No operations of any importance have taken place on any of the fronts held by our Allies.

Some encounters between French patrols and Albanian Comitadjis assisted by Austrians are reported west of Lake OHRIDA.

On 19th January a detachment of French and Russian troops occupied ATHOS peninsula

French Forces/
7. Serbian/The only change in the distribution of the French forces shown in paragraph 2 of my last summary is the relief of the&apos;Serbian 1st Army by the 17th French (Colonial) Division, which, together with the 2nd Russian Brigade, now holds from west of the CERNA near ZOVIK to MAKOVO, and the&apos; absorption of the detachment VICQ into the 156th Division. The .16th (Colonial) Division remains concentrated In thev BANICA. - EKSISU - 30RCVICEV0 area,where is also a brigade of Colonial Cavalry.    The artillery, for the 11th -(Colonial). Division, has all been landed with the exception of one group of 75!s which is still due.     Of the 76th Division, all the infantry has been 1anded and is now . marching to FLORINA, but most of the artillery has yet to arrive..    The first- two regiments of the 30th Division are now being disembarked.The line of French posts guarding the neutral zone south of VERRIA remains as before, the only change being that a battalion of Tirailleurs ALGERIENS is now stationed at KOZAWI and a battalion of Senegalese and two squadrons of Chasseurs d-Afrique have been sent to LAPSISTA.Italian Foroes,The :55th Division still holds from MAKOVO to NOVAK with two brigades in front line and one In reserve.   Being in fairly close contact with the enemy, they appear to have suffered a larger proportion of casualties than is the case with other divisions on the Monastir front.
Serbian and Russian Forces,Owing to wastage and lack of reinforcements the Serbian army is .in course - of re-organisation. /(At thepresent date it can only muster 23,000 effective rifles). .Each division-will in\future consist of three regimentstwo of which are brigaded.   Each regiment will consist : of three battalions and one machine gun section (4 machineguns).   Each battalion will consist of three or fourcompanies and one machine gun section (4 machine guns).In order to bring the above units up to strength, the -fourth regiment of - each brigade -and ;ithe sec ond brigade ofeach division will be disbanded, also the detachment ofvolunteers.   To enable this to be effected, the Serbian :army is gradually being relieved by the French, and aseach Serbian division is withdrawn f rom the line it willbe reorganised.As previously stated the 17th French (Colonial)Division has now relieved the Serbian 1st Army consistingof the MORAVA and VARDAR divisions; which have withdrawnto the SAKULEVO and S0R0VICEV0 areas.The 4th Russian Brigade still remains attached to -the. Serbian 3rd Army.Creek National Forces./During the month of January no further despatch to the front of -Greek national forces has been effected, and the constitution of the army is not proceeding at a rapid rate, owing to the causes stated in my last report of 11th January.It is understood that the third regiment of the SERESDivision/
Division will, be sent to the front early next month, hut no date has,yet been named when a. second division will be ready.   This will probably be the ARCHIPELAGO Division (viz., that from the islands, excluding CRETE).As I stated in the last report, the.full number of reservists in CRETE and the islands are not actually being called up until their equipment is ready, and therefore, although the necessary men are available, the aortual / strengths under arms are at present only as follows:-7/&apos;. ^ ^ Officers*       Other ranks.CANEA Division, of CRETE . 176 .;/   3,818-ARCHIPELAGO.;; Division ;/V//-/; ;   278   . 6,525In addition to adetachment of some 400 to 500 men who /-arrived from EGYPT, other small parties from abroad have also joined at SALONIKA,The despatch of further troops to the front at SALONIKA has been partly d elayed by the fact that nationald etach-ments have had to be utilized for, the suppression of tho deserter movement in the CHALCIDICE peninsula and also for -the same duty in the vicinity of vTCRRIA, // Local enlistment has in consequence not been satisfactory.General Zimbrakakis has left for/CRETE to take command of the 2nd Army Corps.v: With regard to the deserter movement in CHALCIDICE, it . does: not appear that it was due to active royalist agitation, : but merely to. the fact that/the inhabitants of the CHALCIDICE peninsula objected to being enrolled for military service, :such.compulsory enlistment, not having been hitherto actually practised by the Greek or Turkish Governments.   Over 1,000 deserters in all have:been captured up to date or have surrendered either to the national troops of the Provisional Government or to the yeomanry I sent out.   These are beingdealt/
dealt with by the Provisional Government.Administration.The health of this force is now good and there is no especially prevailing disease.       A few cases of trench foot have occurred, in one or two instances with men who had previous history of this complaint..      The small number of cases,&apos; in view of the snow and cold rain-we have.recently experienced, can be regarded as very satisfactory.The railway extension to GUVEZNE, referred to in my summary of 12th November to 7th December, has now commenced; the bridge over the Galiko is finished and some 6 kilometres of the roadway completed.The road for a double line of Decauville is practically completed from STAVROS to TASLI DERBEND, and the laying out of the railway yard and depots at the former place is well on its way.       As Decauville track is earliest forthcoming, the use of standard guage has been given up.       This will simplify the off-loading arrangements from ship to shore, as the maximum weight to be transferred will be 15 tons.     The question of the best methods to be adopted in event of standard guage being provided was, however, being worked out with the Royal Navy.It has been decided to construct a series ofdock close tV, and on the lee side of, the existing solid pier at STAVROS. These ,fdocks5! to be some 120 feet long and of a width sufficient to take the largest lighter. This arrangement is simple, suitable and economical compared with an extension to the pier itself..The construction of these docks has commenced andhas progressed/
. . . .. -    &apos;       io.progressed vrell*    Tho protection afforded by the pior will enable lighters to be &quot;stabled&quot; in theso docks, the design of which will permit off-loading taking place from both sides of the lighter and from one end simultaneously.Certain difficulties relative to transit facilities on the English Quay at Salonika have occurred, and as tho matter has boon represented fully tc the War Office, I only desire to remark that it is essential, if off-loading of ships is to be speedily effected, for all these transit facilities to be in entire possession of the British Army.G.H.Q.Salonika,1st February, 1917,(Bgd.)
