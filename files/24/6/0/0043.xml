&apos; AND-m-y&apos; :   THE RECRUITIIP Off MUNITIONS WORKERS.(1)   I attach a memorandum dealing with the Trade Card Scheme. Two cases have now arisen where Unions threaten strikes unless the scheme is abolished, or they are admitted to its benefits, I am convinced that a definite pronouncement must be made -either the scheme is to be abandoned, or that other Unions are to be admitted to it, or that, as a temporary measure, it is te be extended to cover men in similar occupations who are outside the Unions at present a party to it.     If the latter course is adopted, it should be made very clear that the whfrle system of exemptions will be drastically revised at an early date. (2)   With a view to assisting in the release of men fit for General Service from Munitions Works for the Army, I am having prepared a reasoned estimate of men engaged in Munitions Works by occupations and ages.     Time- does not admit of any exact detailed census.    When these figures are available, I hope to be able to submit to the War Cabinet a scheme for retaining in Munitions Works men indispensable to output, while freeing for service in the Army men who are less essential.     The scheme would proceed on the basis of exempting certain occupations, or men above certain ages in those occupations. (3)    Any such scheme implies, as explained in the last para-graph of the attached memorandum, that certain principles which have; hitherto governed the recruiting of skilled men should be modified, &apos;   -&apos; * -(a) It must be recognised that some men classes as skilled by Engineering Trade Unions are not all required in Munitions Works or in Technical Units in the Army, but should be available for enlistment in line regiments, *-(b) That dilution may be applied to release men for service in the Army, including line regiments. -----[istry- of Munitions. C.A.?,1 Pebruary, 1917. .&apos;
JH3 TRADE CARD SCEEME.Memorandum by the Minister of Munitions.\l)  v.      Lord Derby has. asked mo to bring before the War Cabinet the question whether the Trade Card Scheme should be retained and extended, or should be abolished.The Scheme a? it stands is causing grave and increasing industrial unrest til through the country.   The Ministry of Munitions receive daily strong protests against the present position from representatives of Labour, such as Mr. J. H. Thomas, Mr.:Clynes, Mr. Apple ton, and Mr. Will Thome, from employers, from Trade Union Secretaries, and from individual workmen.The main ground of complaint is that some of the Unions not included in the Scheme have among thoir Members men who are&apos; as skilled as some Members of Trade Card Unions, and who are working side by side with them, but to whom the Unions Cannot issue Trade Cards.   Some of the Trade Card Unions are using their privilege in order to recruit men who are Members of other Unions; for instanoe, 12 machine men, members of the Union of General Workers (not a Trade: Card Union) who were mcdically examined on the 30th January, and passed for general service, were approached by tho Delegate of the United Machine Workers Union with an offer to get them exemption cards as soon as they bad made their; first payment to that Union. .There-are. cases where a Union has issued cards to men whom they regard as skilled, but who are certainly less skilled than other men working in the same shop3, who have not received cards because they belong to another;Union not a party to the Scheme.    The Scheme is undoubtedly being used for purposes; never contemplated; for instance, 3ranch Secretaries have made the issue of Trade;;Cards conditional on payment of
arrears of subscriptions.As soon as the Scheme was announced, certain large Unions asked to be admitted to its benefits, in particular the National Union of Railwaymen, the Workers Union, and the General Union of Workers.   Early in December the Ministry of Munitions referred the question of extending the scheme to the War Office, who finally decided in January that no more Unions could be admitted.There is in existence machinery by which;the Ministry claim from the War Office individual men who are not protected from recruiting, but who have a high degree of skill of a kind required for&quot;munitions work.This machinery could be adapted so as to enable individual members of the excluded Unions, or the Unions themselves, or employers, to claim that particular individuals should be reserved for munitions work, on the ground that if they had been members of a Trade Card Union they would have been entitled to receive a card.    ..o Ministry have proposed a  definite procedure to the VVar Office, on whioh lord Derby has asked me to obtain from the Cabinet a decision whether the Trade Card Scheme is to be extended or abolished.It should be added that the Director of Recruiting suggested to certain Unions in January, 1917, that thoy should put forward claims for individual men, and a considerable number of claims have been made.   The Unions would probably accept the machinery suggested by the Ministry of Munitions if they cannot get the power to issue Trade Cards themselves, but they probably do not realise that the number of their members; whose claim the Ministry v.ill be able to support, and the War Office to admit, will be small, unless it is decided that men are to bo exempted solely on the ground that if they-had been members of the privileged Unions, they
t&quot;&quot;;&quot;:&apos; &apos; 175would have received cards, irrespective of the question whether general service men with their qualifications are needed in munitions work3.5) The truth is that the Trade Card Scheme, as a system forretaining in Munition works men necessary for the out-put of Munitions, is imperfect, for it enables the issue of Trade Cards to men Y/hose work can be performed by women or ineligible males, and whose skill is not essential to the out-put of Munitions and is not needed or needed only to a very limited extent in the artificers units of the Army (examples are core-makers, machinists, certain types of moulders).   On the other hand, there are some classes of skilled men whose retention in munition works is absolutely essential so long as any out-put of munitions is required, but who are not covered by the Scheme at all. 6) The Trade Card Unions hare so far failed to fulfil one ofthe objects with whioh the Agreement ^as nade, namely, the furnishing of skilled men for the artificers corps in the   Army. They have been notified of detailed immediate demands for 1243 skilled men for Railway work and 200 fitters for gun repairs, hut up to February 12th only 250 of thsir Members had enrolled as Army Artificer Volunteers.    A considerable number of the Volunteers who have enrolled huve been found not to possesstho requisite dogroc of skill. 7) On the other hand, tho war Office appear to havo carried outthiir side- of the bargain.   About 475,000 Trade Cards have been issued since the beginning of January when the issue first b-;gan. They promised to continue to make every effort to transfer to mechanical units skilled men whom Unions notified to them as serving in non-mechanical units,, and it is understood that machinery has been set up for combing out such men, and that larg^ numbers have been and are^being transferred to mechanical units.
i H Pthe trade unions may allege as one of the reasons for their failure to produce sufficient skilled volunteers for service in the army that the army rates of pay are insufficient.      they demand pay of 4/- a day which lord derby has definitely refused, this condition was never included in the trade card agreement, and it cannot he said that the war office hy refusing it have failed to carry out the agreement.it is believed that no case has yet been challenged of the issue of a trade card to a man not entitled to receive it.   on the other hand, no definite complaint has yet been received by the ministry of munitions that men holding trade cards have been recruited or that the issue of tr- de cards has not been carried out. )        it is submitted therefore, that recent though the trade card scheme is, it must npw either be abolished, or drastioally revised, or extended, on account of (a) the need for releasing a large number of general service men for munition works (bj the grave industrial unrest which it causes in its present form.   any extension likely to be satisfactory to the unions at present excluded will prevent the release of munition workers for the army in sufficient numbers.    probably a drastic revision, namely the exolu si on from the s cheme of many o f the uni o hs at pre sent included in  it, would satisfy the complaining unions, if it were accompanied by such a system of claiming protection for their fully skilled members as the ministry have suggested to the war office; for the excluded unions complain more of the preferential treatment accorded to certain unions and of the delay which has occurred in giving them a definite answer, than of the actual recruiting of their own members, &apos; . .it will be difficult or impossible to release general service men from munition works in numbers at all approaching those for
which the:Ministry are being asked, unless, in addition to the abolition or drastic revision of the TradeX^ard.&quot;Scheiae.,.two important principles, the subject of various pledges and.agree-- - -aents, are modified.   It must be recognised,firstly, that some men classed as skilled by engineering trade unions are not required in munition works or in the technical units of the Army but should be available for enlistment in line regiments; and secondly, that dilution may be applied to release men for service in the/Army, including line regiments?   She sheet metal workers afford an illustration.   There is no shortage of skilled men of this class, and the Union have therefore successfully resisted dilution.   Much of the work of the skilled men could be done by women, and if dilution could be introduced, a number of men could be released for the -army,   as they are not needed in technical corps, or only in very small numbers, they should be available for service in line regiments.   Three of the Unions who are party to the Trade Card Scheme include sheet-metal workers.Attached is a summary of the Trade Card Agreement and a list of the Unions which have signed it.
APPENDIX.

The trade card Scheme arose out of the Sheffield strike last November on the Hargreaves case. A list of the twenty-five Unions who are parties to it is attached. The agreement with the Unions (which was signed by the Minister of Munitions, lord Derby, Mr. Henderson, and Mr. Chamberlain) provided that all members of the Unions not then fully engaged on war-work or who ceased thereafter to be so engaged, should enrol as War Munition Volunteers, and that all skilled men on war work or enrolled as War Munition Volunteers who were either journeymen or apprentices prior to 15th August, 1915, should receive from their Trade Unions a card of exemption from military service, in a form authorised by the Army Council. The Trade Unions undertook to do their utmost to provide the Ministry of Munitions with skilled men, either for transfer to war-work or for service in the artificers corps of the Army, The agreement expressly said:-

"If skilled men for the Army are not secured in this way, it is clearly understood that recourse must be had to the statutory powers."

The Unions undertook to furnish particulars of skilled men serving in non-mechanical corps in the Army, and the Army Council promised to continue to make every effort to transfer such skilled men to mechanical units.
