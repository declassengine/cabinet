S.EC RE T,No, O.A.D. 324.General Headquarters, British Armies in the &apos;. 3rd March, 1917,The Chief of .theImperial General Staff.Since .my return from the CALAIS Conference information has continued to reach me to tin: effect that the enemy&apos;s re-tlremont on the ARC EE may ho the commencement of a vithdravul on a larger scale - probably in connection -%th a carefully thought-out offensive scheme.I attach a paper summarising some of the possibilities of the situation, - it?, special- reference to the danger of an attack designed to turn, my left flank and sever my communica-tione with the northern Channel ports. -If-, as is- probable, the enemy, contemplate a- decporate effort to retrieve his situation and snatch victory at the eleventh, hour, such a n attack is not unlikely to appeal to him.     The brunt of it&apos; would - fall in the first instance on the British Armies and on the Belgians covering the loft of those Armies..     Our positions in that area are notoriously difficult to hold ageinst a determined attack by: superior numbers--, and even:.if successfully,, maintained against front -al attack their security might he compromised by the..Belgians on our left giving way .      1In face of this, as veil as of the various other,possi-bilities of tho situation j the primary-&apos;quest ion,, for de-cision is -/diether the intondcd allied &apos;&quot;6ffensive is to.belaunched
launched, as soon as possible-in the- belief that the enemy may.. thereby be deprived of the initiative and turned from his purpose.I7e must assume that the enemy will have weighed the chances of this danger and will have designed measures to deal with it. If so, and if his measures prove adequate, the possible gravity of the resulting situation - will be evident to you.In the&apos;attached paper I have outlined the possibilities of such a situation, with special reference to my left flank: if the enemy should select /-the area between LILLE and the sea for his decisive effort, and if his blow should fall when the Allies had already massed their forces for,  and committed them to, an offensive.- . ,There are of course various other courses of action open. The enemy has made many mistakes and miscalculations in the past.   He may fail to restore tho waning confidence of his troops.   And his plans may miscarry, as they have done more than once already.-  But before embarking on a course .of action it is necessary to weigh carefully the full risks involved and to be prepared to meet then.Heretofore, the necessary power and responsibility having been entrusted to me, I have been enabled to take such measures as I doomed to be required for the security of. my front;    and I;have not found it necessary to point out risks which it lay/-with me to consider and guard against.   Under the altered conditions resulting from the recent - decision of the War Cabinet I have to consider the possibility of finding myself no longer free to deal adequately with such .an-/-emergency as I -have pointed out - an emergency which is. certainly
certainly within the possibilities of the situation,I: therefore deem it necessary to reportunder the., provisions of parao(ill) of the :Agreement recently signed at CALAIS, the steps I propose to take to minimise so far as I can the possible dangers . of the.&quot;situation, . and my reasons.therefor *     These , st eps wi11 unavoidably. aff ect my offensive preparations,,.As I have only just completed my study of the changes in the general situation which may result from the enemy1s recent action I have not yet been.able to ascertain General ITivelie&apos;s views ,     I am therefore unable to say how he regards the questions raised in the attached paper (of which I am sending him a copy) or whethen factors affecting,. British more: immediately and. directly than Prench interests will carry so much relative importance In his judgment as they necessarily do in mine,/ , (sd),     D, Haig.Pield-Marshal; Commanding in Chief, British Armies in France,
SECRET.PRECIS OP&apos; &quot;&quot;REVIEW OF PRESENT SITUATION ON THE WESTERN FRONT WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE GERMAN WITHDRAWAL&apos; ON THE SOiVME&quot; by FIELD MRS HAL SIR D&apos;. HAIG, dated 2nd March, 1917,The enemy&apos;s withdrawal on the /ncre points to changes in the general situation which require careful consideration. The available evidence tends to strengthen the view that, this withdrawal is a first step in a considerable rearward movement in a much wider front.By taking up a line running from the neighbourhood of Arras, or possibly from Lille, by St:, Quentin, Lc Fere and Laon c:nci thence southwards, the enemy Would shorten his front by, many miles and would thereby set free several divisions for offensive purposes.       Such a line, known as the &quot;Hindenburg line&quot;, is being constructed.A close study of future possibilities leads to the following conclusions: -   - a(a )    PRO&quot;APILITY OF A GERMAN OFFENSIVE.-The Germans are believers in the principle that a determined offensive on a large scale is the only method of giving a quick decision, and the internal condition of Germany renders an early decision desirable I(b)    THE PRO&quot;ABLE METHOD OF APPLYING THIS PRINCIPLE.The -enemy will probably concentrate the maximum force o-a      - a?      a &apos; - h;: a: :V&quot;&apos; &quot;the
2.the front selected for attack ,.and will endeavour to gain time &quot;by carefully prepared delaying action on other: fronts until a decision is reaf-ed.   This would seem to be the enemy&apos;s present plan and if it is the off ens ive preparations already made b- the Allies might be rendered entirely nugatory, as th;ir attack would become little more than a blow in the air.(c) THE e:mJY&apos; S choice of FRQImT FO^? AW OFFKISIYE. Tactical success would be more easily gained inRussia than on the:Western Front but a great strategical success would be difficult to obtain.    On the other hand, in the Western Theatre these conditions would be rever-- : Sed.- &apos;-y&apos;-y Wv&apos;; -W^The;enemy found it necessary to make a grea* effort to hold t :e Allied a&apos;.tack in France last year and he might consider it easier to hold a Russian offensive in check. V :&apos;:;:;-.&apos;-;&apos;:^The weight of: argument is therefore in fa* our of a German offensive on the Western Front.(d) choicf of time.   ^^v&apos;:-A^&quot;-y&apos;^:-&apos;--^:-/:h^:&quot;-;The prospects of a decisive tactical success would ::  be. greatest if their offensive v/ere launched after the -Fr en ch and Briti sh Armies had been committed to an attack.   The. success of such a plan v/ould depend on the enemy1s preparations for delaying .our offensive.
(e) ASSUMING THE GERMANS ATTACK OH THE WESTERN FRONT, WHICH PART OF THAT F5QNT /ILL BE CHOSEN ?No certain indications have at present been obtained but an attack &quot;between Lille and the sea is In my opinion the most likely contingency.The Ypres soctor is difficult to defend and its security depends on the Belgian Army over whose arrangements and dispositions I have no control.A successful German attack on this front would turn my left flank and would cut me off from the three ports in Northern France on which I rely for a considerable portion of my requirements.     This enterprise would fit in with the enemy&apos;s schemes of submarine, warfare, and would involve the most serious consequences.The Ypres sector has always been a source of anxiety and has become more so since my centre of gravity was shifted southwards by the extension of my line.     The rail-ways on which I should be dependent in the event of an emergency are not under my control.     By the recent decision of the Calais Conference I am deprived of the disposal of my reserves at the critical moment, and even as regards the general disposition of my troops on the British Front during the preparatory period, my hands have been somewhat tied.(f) GENERAL SUMMARY OF THE SITUATION AND DEDUCTIONS.&apos;Thd enemy&apos;s excellent system of defences, and the formation of; his numerous new divisions, may enable him to. carry through his attack to a decision before theAllied a.
Allied attack has gained one.-In my opinion it is/doubtful whether we can rely onthe proposed Allied offensive turning him from hia purposewhatever it may be..Meanwhile I consider that the safety of the BritishArmy might be gravely compromised if my forces are com-mitted beyond recall to some enterprise which.would pre-vent me meeting all possible developments,I am, therefore, of opinion that for the presentsufficient reserves must be retained in my own hands tomeet any possible action on the enemy&apos;s part 05th March, 1917.
