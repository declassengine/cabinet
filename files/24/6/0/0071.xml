Calnnel W. DallyThis Document is the property of the Secretary of State for India.SECRET,   iFrom Secretary of State to Viceroy, 14.th February1917.3444. Your telegram dated 6th February, No. 1765. The War Cabinet having again considered the question are not satisfied at present either that a case has been made out for unifying all the forces in Persia under a single General Officer or that the local situation at Shiraz requires an officer of that rank. They think that unless and until a Turkish advance in force is seriously threatened present arrangement as regards Sykes should not be altered and that it will suffice if Sykes is left in command of the Indian troops in Fars and the Southern Persian Rifles provided that there is attached to him as adviser a military officer of field rank experienced in tribal warfare to whom in practice he would delegate military operations and executive command in the field. Sykes&apos; relations to Minister, Teheran, will not be changed. Bushire will remain as now under General Officer Commanding, Force&apos;.&quot; D.&quot; As regards organisation of Southern Persian Rifles they think that Sykes&apos; other pre-occupations may have prevented him from giving sufficient attention to this side of his task, but that relief now afforded will enable him to do so.  Will you select military officer referred to above ?..From Viceroy, Army Department, 2ith February 1917.2731. Your telegram of 14th instant, 3444. We have received with the utmost disappointment the decision of the-War Cabinet. Having formerly come to the conclusion (?vide) your telegram of the 9th ultimo 3431, that the operations in Southern Persia had assumed a distinctly military character which necessitated a material change in the present unsatisfactory arrange--ments, they have now, in spite of our strong (word omitted), abandoned their previous view, altered their minds, and decided not only to continue a system to which they, like Ourselves, object, but also to retain in charge an officer in whose capacity for the present undertaking we have lost confidence. For which opinion, if desired, we can give specific -reasons.Moreover, this decision conflicts with sound military principle laid down by the Chief of Imperial General Stall in his note on the control of operations in Mesopotamia submitted to the War Committee on 3rd February 1916.In regard to the suggestion of the War Cabinet to appoint a military officer who would be junior to Sykes, such a proposal does not commend itself to the Commander-in-Chief. He regards it as obviously inequitable and unsound to assign responsibility for military operations to an officer who has no power of direction. We agree fully and would earnestly ask for reconsideration of the whole matter.If, however, the War Cabinet persist, in - their: decision, only course possible appears to be to leave Sykes in full charge of both operations and organisation. In such circumstances the Government of India, feeling as they do, trust that they may be relieved of all responsibility. In the meantime to assist Sykes we are rjroviding him with a highly experienced senior administrative Staff Officer and a qualified GeneralStaff Officer. But we are deferring appointment of the senior military officer until we receive War Cabinefs decision after hearing our views,
