It must be borne in mind that the number of fit men under 31 years of age now exempted by Tribunals is not large. From an estimate which has been obtained it would appear that there are now in civil life less than 700,000 men in medical categories A. or Bi between 18 and 31 years of age. Of those, about 600,000 are in protected industries (some 300,000 being in munitions, including shipbuilding).

Consequently there are no more than 100,000 men of these categories exempted by Tribunals, and of these quite a third are in agriculture and another third is certified occupations. It is manifest, therefore, that the sternest revision of Tribunal exemptions can give but a small total yield of fir men.
