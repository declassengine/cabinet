New Formations.---On lOtli November 1916, the War Office asked that every effort might be made to release white troops from minor theatres .of war for service on the main British front, and suggested that the question of raising additional units from the fighting races in India should be taken up at once. 1 *  . t. As a result of correspondence the following arrangements have been made:- &apos;   ;, :I. The Government of India have undertaken  .:.-:       (a) to release 12 Territorial battalions (to be replaced by 6 Garrison battalions and 6 Volunteer battalions embodied in India, a Territorial battalion being released on the arrival of each of the Garrison battalions); -       (b) to release 13 Service battalions from the 13th Division in Meso-potamia. (to be replaced by an Indian Division of 3 British battalions and 10 Indian battalions ; 3 battalions being made ready for embarkation for Mesopotamia by the end of February, - 4 by the,end of March, 4 by the middle of April, and 2 by the end of April;; and these in turn being replaced by 13 battalions to be newly raised);   \ . (c) to expand 3 Indian battalions in Egypt to 6 battalions; -.-----.--: (J) to introduce compulsory service for Europeans in India.II. The War Office have undertaken-(a) to send out 5 Garrison battalions (the sixth being dispensed with as the 80th Carnatics . have been released  by the  Ceylon Government), of which one has already started ; (6). to despatch, if possible by the end of March, 110,000 rifles ; .  (c) to supply all equipment required ; (d) to supply Mechanical Transport required ; (c) to keep up supply of drafts ; -- (/) to release British officers of the Indian Army as far as.possible.2 &amp; 3. / Munitions and; Supplies.-The Government of India are en-deavouring to increase sources of supply both as regards raw. produce and raw materials, and as regards manufactured, articles such as steel and munitions of war. The growing of wheat lias been encouraged and a record acreage (32 to 33 million acres) is hoped for this year. The following commodities (for which India is in some cases: the sole or. main source of supply) are supplied to the United Kingdom and. the Allies under various&apos; schemes of State control:-(!.) sandbags, at the rate of 50 million per mensem ; (2) raw jute, about 6,500 tons monthly; (3). saltpetre,. 37,500 cwts. monthly ; : (4) manganese ore, 40,000 tons monthly ; (5) wolfram, 360. tons monthly; (6) mica, 4,250 cwts. monthly with probable increase.to 8,000 cwts.; (7) shellac, .4,000 cwts. monthly; (8) oil seeds in large quantities for the manufacture of glycerine and margarine, and in the case of castor seed for. the manufacture of lubricating oil for /aeroplanes;; (9) wool, about 2,600,000 lbs. monthly,
which represents the whole exportable surplus ; (10) leather; 30,000 cwts.&apos; monthly ; - arrangements also are being made to take over on behalf of His Maj esty &apos;s1 G overnmeht and - the Italian Governm eat the - whole of the ex-: portable surplus (estimated at&apos; 5,000,000) of raw hides.   Shipping in Eastern -waters is now dependent on Indian coal, and supplies have been maintained at the expense of the railways and industries of India.Arrangements have been made for the supply from India of grain for army horses in Sal onica, Italy and Southern France.:- 4. Internal Condition. -The agitation for Home Rule for India was started by. Mrs.Besant in the autumn of 1915. She failed to persuade the officials of the National Congress of December 1915 to give it their formal support; but pushed it herself through her paper, &quot;New India,&quot; and her agents and publications in the Theosophical Societ3r. She also established branches of the Home Rule League in India and in London. At the meeting of the National Congress in December last the principal resolution carried,was one asking that the King should issue a proclamation promising self-government at an early date, and that in the meantime the reforms already demanded by the Congress and Moslem League in relation to the public services and the legislative councils should be introduced.The attempt to identify the Theosophical Society with particular views on Indian politics has aroused some opposition in England in Theosophical circles, but Mrs. Besants action has not been repudiated, and the machinery of the Theosophical Society is being utilised for spreading &quot; Home Rule for India&quot; propaganda by means of meetings and pamphlets. Mr. Zini-rajdasa, a young Indian disciple of Mrs. Besant, has addressed these meetings, and Mr. Lansbury (ex Member of Parliament), and Mr. John Scurr; have identified themselves with the movement, while a large number of Trade and Labour Unions in this country have transmitted to the Secretary. of State resolutions (evidently dictated from a common centre) protesting against the measures which the authorities in India have taken in regard to Mrs. Besant&apos;s agitation. -:--..Nabiia.--Nabha is a Sikh State in the Punjab, and has a population of 249,000. The present Maharaja (age 34) has always shown himself a man of very difficult temper. When he succeeded his father in 1911 he claimed that the succession did not require the recognition of the Paramount Power, and since that date he has consistently displayed the utmost reluctance to discuss official matters relating to&apos;his State with the Political Agent &apos; -appointed by the Government of India. He offered the services of his Imperial Service Troops at the beginning of the Avar, but the offer was refused in view of his unsatisfactory attitude; but he has contributed to public funds.. .:    Telegram from the -Viceroy to the Secretary of State for fortnightending l-l//t February 1917.1. New Formations. Infantry battalions: Of the 13 being formed, three are complete, five within 200 men of completion, one within 300, four within 400, of. completion. Sappers and Minos / Two companies completed, one will be completed by end of March. (? Attached) unit No. 16 Divisional Signal Company, two-thirds complete; No. 3 Wireless Signal Squadron, nine-tenths complete. Transport:. Since September last, three pack-mule corps (two of which were expanded from cadres), two camel- corps and led-bullock corps, have been formed while three camel corps, led- bullock .&apos;corps,-.: and five Ekka and pony corps are now in process of formation. Recruiting: 4,400 Indian recruits, for combatant units enrolled during fortnight ending 11th February. Sanction to begin recruitment of labourers for Europe awaited. Officers: 100 Officers have been provided for the 13 new Infantry battalions, six Out of 75 Officers required for labour corps in France have been procured, 99 Cavalry pincers have;been detailed as special reinforce- -ment for Cavalry in France,&apos; and. 26 Officers.have been placed at disposal of War Office by re-organisation oL Artillery. 20 additional Officers are being detailed for recruiting purposes and 12 Staff Officers are being specially
selected for registration and embodiment of volunteers in India; Medical: We have sanctioned. equipment of one British and four Indian Clearing Hospitals,.23 Indian Stationary Hospitals, and; six /Indian General Hospitals as a reserve - for. 0 verseas Expeditionaiy Forces.;, equipments for these are- now being/collected.&apos;:; Since the beginning of the war 358 Officers have been given temporary commissions : in Indian - Medical Service, 311 of. whom are,: now serving, and 355 dresser compounders.have.been entertained to supple-ment military sub-assistant surgeon branch of Indian Subordinate Medical Department.2. Munitions.-In order to&quot;reduce demands on England for stores, .&amp;c, we are constituting a central munitions board to deal with further development of manufacture in India. Ordnance factories are at present giving maximum production of which they are capable.3. Supplies.---We have undertaken supplj of all vaccines, anti-venine required for Mesopotamia, and of large quantities of grain and fodder for Egypt and Salonica.: Extensive preparations are being made by the Forest Department feu-supply of timber for Egypt and Salonica. We have issued orders for the reconstruction of the Medical Store Depot, Bombay, and the transfer of the MedicalStore Depot, Madras, to the Gun Carriage Factory at that place ; the Gun Carriage Factory, modified to suit requirements of depot, will, it is believed, be available for. occupation by 1st April next. When these measures have been completed it will, it is hoped, be possible for the depots at Bombay and Madras to meet most of India&apos;s requirements for medical and surgical- stores. In the meantime we are considering question of the extent to which stores now imported from England can be manufactured or obtained in India.4. Internal Condition-Reports show Home Rule agitation is likely to be conducted with vigour and method in India, and it will probably have a -disturbing influence. A small deputation is likely to visit England to press it there.There has been a lull in political outrages in Bengal, and there is hope that so. long as present vigorous campaign is continued the revolutionary movement will be paralysed.Internal conditions of Punjab, thanks to strong administration, are more than usually quiet.Elsewhere the internal situation gives no cause for special anxiety, though people are a. little restless at high prices of some, commodities. Good rain iu Northern India just now would bring down prices of grain -and is rather badly needed.Selection of Bikaner to assist Secretary of State in Imperial War Conference has been welcomed with marked and widespread enthusiasm by the ruling princes and chiefs generally who regard it as a recognition - of their importance as a body in the general scheme of Empire./For the rest, there is no diminution in the manifestations of loyal and patriotic spirit of chiefs, and the stream of contributions continues to flow unabated. Amongst numerous recent offers may be mentioned specially a further contribution of 10 lakhs from Mysore, a further gift of Rs. 45,000 -a-month- from Rao of Cutch towards maintenance for a third year of an Indian infantry regiment at the front, a further donation of 3 lakhs from Prime Minister and Government of Nepal, the gift of Rs. 4,51,200 by princes and people : of Rajput ana and A j in er-Mer war a for aircraft and machine guns, of the raising of three additional companies of Bikaner Camel Corps by the Maharaja of Bikaner; further gifts of 1 lakh each by the Maharaja of Baroda and Maharaja of Jind, and Rs. 50,000 each by the Maharaja of Jaipur and Maharaja of In (lore. To the list of Imperial Service Troops which proceeded on service are added Mysore Imperial Service Transport Corps, Kashmir-Imperial Service Mountain Battery.The attitude of Nabha continues to be somewhat perverse, and his hostility to the Punjab Government is still maintained. But there have been no overt signs of disloyalty, and His Highness still professes his anxiety to help Government in any way. He is said to be preparing.a memdrialto the Secrotarv of State against the decision of Lord Hardino-e&apos;s -Government.\
