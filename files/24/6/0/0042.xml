SECRET   .V. ; : V  -G.T.)41IMORASDUM   ON   THE WAR   CABIE3T &apos;S   RECENTDECISION   ABOUT RECRUITING.Effects of the-Decision;\ The Y/ar Cabinet, has - reoent ly decid ed . that all men between the ages of 18 - 32, who are fit for General,Service, are to be released for. the Army, except from occupations cf vital national importance. These occupations are defined as those covered by the Trade Card Scheme, the production of steel, agriculture, mines, quarries, railway shops, transport work and; -;shipyards.The Admiralty understand that the Minister ef Munitions has represented to .the War Cabinet that this decision, as new being interpreted, doea not exempt many industries essential to the production of munitions.     The Admiralty desiremost strongly to suppert this contention, with special reference to the industries in which they are interested.In the first place, the exemption of Shipyards is useless unless Marine Engine Works and Shops and Tube Works^are also included, since the governing factor in completing a ship is the out put. of engines and of the tubes required in connection therewith.Other articles equally essential to the ship -building industries are anchors, chains, instruments, asbestos, wire, etc., etc., .which are not. at present covered by the List of prctectected Trades.    &apos;Again as steel is included in this list., so should be many; other metals, such as copper, brass and; aluminium, which are equally difficult to obtain and equally essential:    since the limiting factor in theoutput

II. SUGGESTIONS.

The admiralty feel most strongly that the list of vital occupations should be extended to include Marine Engine shops; all trades ancillary to the manufacture of steel; the production of copper, wire, brass, aluminium and other metals essential for munitions; the manufacture of tubes, wire and wire goods, asbestos, guns, gun mountings, fire control and other instruments such as hydrophones, torpedoes, mines and their gear, explosives, paravanes, aircraft, storage batteries, periscopes, &amp;c.

It is thought that the Army&apos;s demands for men could be met without such a great sacrifice in the output of Warships and Cargo-carrying vessels. The Admiralty have already accepted the policy of substitution and appointed officers to carry it out. Unfortunately there have been so many changes with regard to this policy, and the position is still so ambiguous, that very little has yet been done in this direction.

III APPENDIX: (TYPICAL CASES)

(a) Messrs. Elliot Bros., (Lewisham).

The Military Authorities have called up 16 skilled men who are all engaged on urgent Admiralty contact, including Director Firing Gear and various Fire Control apparatus. The Firm say that these men have reached their present degree of skill through 4 or 5 years of experience, and any substitutes would have to go through the same period of training.

(b) Messrs. Webster &amp; Bickerton. (Goole).

This Firm are making Trolleys for transporting 15-inch ammunition in magazines, which have already been delayed through shortage of labour. the Firm state that the dilution already introduced has resulted in a 25.

decrease
-2-oiitput of ships end monitions is tho. available supply, of the scarcest essential material.    Any interference with the output of aluminium, for instanc e, wi 11 prevent the construction of Bigid Airships cad other Aircraft.;  ./von in tho metal industries which obtain partial protection under tho 2rade .-jar&amp;- Scheme, the loss of somi-skilled and unskilled men will cause severe temporary disorganisation and a permanent decrease of . output.     -creover the Card Scheme does not apply (a) to industries producing raw and semi-manufactured commodities, or non-metallic articles.: (b) to mentally, as opposed to physically,-skilled men such &amp;a Chemists.In short, the .&apos;.*ar Cabinet1 s Decision will lead to serious delays ia shipbuilding generally - an opinion fully Glared &quot;by the -:.Ship-ping :lo:rfcroller - cad also to a decrease in the production of ye ry import ant classes of munitions, of which liarine engines, forging s, copper and steel tubes, storage batteries for Submarines, ships&apos; guns, mines,; aircraft and paravanes ere examples. 2he total diminution of output is estimated at not lese than 10,* and may be much greater.    2!hio is doubly serious, inasmuch aa the imy1 s, demands on the Marine aaginoerisas and allied industries for oanitions 6c have long ago caused a disturbance in tho pre-war balance between those trades and shipbuilding Yards, which lias not yet boon redressed, in spite of extensive dilution.     This parti cularly applies to thc manufacturo of copper and brass tubes.An Appendix to this jlemorandum gives a few -typical cases of the decia ion1s effect on Pirns engaged on Admiralty work.
