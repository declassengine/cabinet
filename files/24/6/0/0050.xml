qsecret. Copy no.o.1/86/251german y&apos;s intentions,1. in various papers which i have recently submitted to the war cabinet, attention has been called to the large number of divisions which germany has formed since last easter, and is still in progress of forming. these divisions have been partially built up by withdrawing battalions from existing divisions, with the result that the greater number of german divisions, but not all, now have nine battalions, whereas all our divisions have 12 and the french divisions have either 9 or 12. the division is, there-fore, no longer a suitable unit for comparing the strengths of the opposing forces, and the situation can best be judged by comparing the number of battalions.2. when the whole of our divisions now under orders reach france, the number of entente battalions on the western front will be : british...       ...      ...      ...      .......      ...     801french ... -     ...      ...      ...      ...      ...  1,360belgian ......      ...      ...      ...      ...     120or a total of .2,281, as against 1,341 german battalions a difference in our favour of 940. (our 801 does not include the 12 battalions of the portuguese division, or the 5th canadian division. the former are of very doubtful value, and certainly will not be of much use for some time to come. the despatch of the 5th canadian division has not yet been agreed to by the canadian government. the value of the belgian battalions is also a doubtful factor, mainly because of the poor quality of their officers. the difference of 940 battalions may therefore be regarded as a fair working estimate.)3. it is worthy of note that the difference on 1st july last was practically the same, namely, 942, although we have since sent out 104 additional battalions, while the number of german battalions has been increased only by 2. the reasons for this disappointing situation are two-fold-the despatch of further british and french divisions to salonika, and the reduction, due to diminishing man-power, of most of the french divisions from 12 to 9 battalions.4. as regards artillery the figures at the end of march will be, if germany does not meanwhile reinforce, approximately as follows : 		other natures of guns and .	field guns.	howitzers (i.e., all above		18-pr. and 75-mm.)-british     ......	3,290	2,490. -     french     ....      .. : ;	6,300	3,900belgian    ..               ..      ...	.430	160compared with germany&apos;s figures of 4,180 field guns and 7,080 other guns and howitzers.5. between the 1st july and the middle of october last, germany placed 147 additional battalions in the field, mainly on the roumanian front. that reserve having been used up she is now creating another, certainly of 150 battalions and possibly of 300. these are still in germany and are exclusive of those shown in paragraph 2 as being on the western front, and of 886 battalions in eastern theatres. to what extent the whole of these 150 or 300 battalions are being given the necessary artillery and other arms and formed into complete divisions we do not yet know. but we know that some of them are being so organized, and our information tends to show that all will ; eventually be so.. the net result is that by the new divisions she is known to have formed and placed in the field, germany has been able to maintain the balance on the western front as it was last summer, and also to provide for the extension of her front caused by the entry of roumania in the war, and, in addition, she is building up a new reserve for such employment as she may decide.   what she will decide is a question to which(b17/166)   15   2/17   h&amp;s   -a238wo
no reliable answer can at present be given, but the following investigation of the different courses open to her will, it is hoped, be of assistance to the War Cabinet in deciding as to our own future plans and preparations.6. The German attack on Verdun was launched just a year ago,: and the.fact that it was in preparation was known a month, before,..but .there are as yet no definite signs of German preparations on a corresponding scale. A number of movements have taken place during the last few months between the German Eastern and Western Fronts, with the result that the Western Front has been reinforced, since . 1st... December by four divisions. It is also believed that two, and possibly four, cavalry divisions from Roumauia have recently been moved to the Western : Front. The effect of tbese movements, and of certain regroupings on the Western Front has been the reinforcement of the ,Germans in Flanders by three divisions, a cavalry division, and a number of. heavy batteries; in Lorraine by. two divisions; and in Alsace by four divisions and a cavalry division. Hone of these concentrations are. on a sufficient scale to indicate the intention to carry out great offensive operations. They may be the prelude to locals attacks of some importance, or they may be merely defensive. Certain movements have recently taken place on our own and on the French fronts which it is unnecessary to describe in detail, but which might have induced the enemy to order the movements described above and. so to.distribute his reserves as to be able to.meet an attack on a large scale on any part of his line. He may, however, intend concentrating them later on with the object of taking the offensive himself. .y. 7. Whatever may be his intentions in this respect it seems fairly evident that he is determined, to maintain his front in the West stubbornly, and I do not think that he is likely to shorten his line until he is compelled to do so. The possession of Belgium and of north eastern France is, at present, his chief asset, and I have little doubt but that he is prepared to make great sacrifices to keep both. If this view is correct, it may be assumed that a portion, at least, of the general reserve which is now forming is ear-marked for the Western Front, at least until the prospects of success of the Entente offensive there can be more clearly estimated by him than they can at present. It therefore appears improbable for the moment that the enemy intends to make a great effort on the main Eastern front. Moreover, owing to the conditions of ground and climate, such an operation cannot begin until May, and by then the Russian armies will have materially improved, both in numbers and equipment, and the Roumanian Army will have recovered to some extent from its debacle. -8. An attack on the Allied forces at Salonika is not improbable, as this might be carried through with a portion only of Germany&apos;s available reserves, assisted by such ; Turkish and Bulgarian divisions as can be spared; if a defensive attitude were adopted on the Roumanian Front. On the other hand, the attractions of such an enterprise do not appear great now that Greece has been rendered comparatively harmless, and the strength of the Entente forces in Macedonia has been increased. Further, it is against Germany&apos;s principles to commit reserves to a secondary theatre until she knows how matters are likely to progress on the main fronts. In 1915 and 1916 her offensives in the Balkans took place in the autumn when danger of a serious Allied attack either in the West or in the; East had ceased. While, therefore, a German offensive in Macedonia is a possibility which must be taken into account, it does not appear to be among the inost probable eventualities. It depends to some extent upon the opening ;:. afforded by the ac tion of General Sarrail, and the efficiency of our sea communications -both- being matters of considerable doubt.     -9. There remains the Italian Front, and here the inducements are by no means small. . Austria is the weakest member of the Central Group, and is in such urgent need of support that if she is left without some effective encouragement there is a risk that :   she may endeavour to break away.. &apos;. . The success of the Austrian offensive from the Trentino last June has clearly shown what might be accomplished against the Italians if the Austrians are reinforced by Germans. The Italians have never yet met German troops in any numbers, and are notoriously nervous as to the outcome of such a meeting. Lastly, the material and m-jral advantages which an invasion of the plains of Lombardy offer are great, while the Italian forces are so placed as to make a blow delivered against them from the. : Trentino very deadly. : -    ...: Italy, is very much alive to. this danger, and the question of assisting her,&apos; either directly or indirectly, was no doubt discussed by Generals Nivelle and Cadorna at their recent meeting.   But I am not aware whether a definite and mutually satisfactory
agreement was reached, and I propose, therefore, shortly to visit, both, Generals and ascertain how the matter stands. The attack on Italy can hardly : develop untd the. beginning of May, and before then events on the Western Front, may have decided the question as to how the German reserve is to be employed.     ;    -      ,,: 10. Nothing has been said above regarding any reserves, which/Germany might, make available for the Western Front by withdrawing troops from the Eastern Front.. It is hoped, and believed, that these would, at the best, be small, as Russia and Roumania should be able to hold the 74 German and 45 Austrian divisions now on the line Riga-Black Sea. ;&apos; We cannot rely upon more than this being done. Russia has in the past done good work against the Austrians, but other &quot;and better dispositions have since been made by the enemy, and I am afraid that, . in &apos; 1917 at any rate, the prospect of Russia gaining important successes over German troops is not very promising. - :-.&apos;F1 .&quot;.&apos;- &apos; - &apos;. -   -     &apos; -;11. To sum up, Germany is now preparing a large reserve, but has not yet given any clear indication how she intends to employ it.Her general attitude on the Western Front is at present defensive, and appears to show her determination to hold her&apos;line, there to the utmost of her power, but she may, of course, later on decide to change to the offensive.An attack on the Allied forces at. Salonika on a considerable scale is possible, but not very probable, provided General Sarrail does the right thing, and our sea-communications are reasonably efficient.&apos; &apos;.-.-;g .      :; -;There are as yet no signs of prepai-ation for an offensive on the Eastern Front, which could not begin until May, and does not, assuming that the Western Front absorbs a large portion of the available reserve, promise very great results.On the Italian Front the prospects are attractive, but an attack on a large scale could not well take place before May, and therefore it largely depends upon what happens meanwhile on the&apos;Western Front.&apos; - &apos; &apos;12. From the fact that Germany has a large reserve which is not yet committed in any one direction, and which she is preparing to use in accordance with the developments of the military situation, it seems probable that if the Franco-British operations in France meet with good success,; the whole or almost the whole of this reserve will be thrown against us in a great counter-attack intended to retrieve the situation and prove to the world the inviolability of the Western Front. If, on the other hand, our operations are only moderately successful, and their progress can be checked by a comparatively small portion of the German reserve, it is probable that the remainder will be thrown against Italy in order to achieve a spectacular coup, or, if circumstances require, they may be sent to the Eastern Front. It is also possible that, if the Entente operations in the West are unduly postponed, and if Germany has her reserve ready, she may be tempted to try and dislocate our plans by attacking first as she did last year. Given these conditions and&apos; intentions, she might be able to expand her present preparations into an attack on a large scale towards the end of March. \      :      &apos; V -      v. - . &apos; -.The situation therefore needs to be closely watched, and, broadly speaking, it may be said that the sooner the Entente can put in their attack the better, consistent with the completion of adequate preparations. : The whole question is, as is usual in war, one of balancing advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand it would clearly be an advantage to prevent the enemy from anticipating us by taking the offensive and thereby perhaps upsetting our.plans; on the other hand we must avoid giving away points by commencing, unnecessarily, before; we are reasonably ready. Having regard to. relative, strength and to the vital importance of the operations, we certainly have no points to give away. -v-:.-.--- -13. No matter what Germany may do, it is quite clear that we must be prepared for severe fighting and heavy losses on the Western Front, for the role which has been allotted to us in General NivehVs plan makes it probable, and indeed desirable, if that plan is to meet with a proper measure of success, that a large portion of the German reserves should be thrown against us.; ; The forces of France are steadily ; diminishing and, as already explained, the large reinforcements which we have &apos; recently sent to Sir Douglas Haig.barely suffice to maintain the relative position of the opposing forces on the Western Front, without taking the German reserves into account at all. If we allow our forces to dimmish too we. are not justified In looking to the future with any confidence of complete victory. As I have repeatedly pointed put in other papers, Germany is now making a supreme effort which, as she has not the men required to maintain in the field for a long period all the new divisions she is forming, seems to be directed to obtaining an early decision of the war. &apos;
14. I have also previously drawn attention to Germany s plan of employing practically the whole of her forces on the main fronts, and using those of her Allies, who cannot or will not send troops to those fronts, to compel the Entente to make detachments to secondary theatres. For example, in Macedonia there are about 40,000 German troops as against nearly 400,000 French and British troops. But Germany&apos;s power of forcing detachments is not limited to this method alone. Without moving &amp; man or a gun she compels us to keep at home, irrespective of recruits being trained as drafts, a total of about 350,000 men* for the defence of naval ports, protection against raids, preservation of order in Ireland, and security against invasion ; by maintaining 15 Zeppelins with crews of a total strength of about 300 men she forces us to emplov some 15,000 men for anti-aircraft defence alone ; and now by her submarine campaign, which employs a comparatively smallnumber of men, she is tempting us to divert more and more men to the construction of shipping, and to the maintenance of our food supplies. Though the methods adopted by Germany are, in some, cases, new, the principle on which she is acting is as old: as war itself-the numerically-weaker but centrally-placed power using its position to redress the balance by compelling its more numerous enemy to keep back a portion of his forces to defend himself against a blow which may issue from the centre against any point on the outer circle. No comparison between the man-power of the Entente and ot their enemies is of value which does not take this cardinal fact into account. It is for these reasons that the problem of our man-power is now the most urgent question which confronts us. All indications go to show that the campaign of the coming summer will govern the final issue of the war ; and, therefore, it is imperative that the effort which Germany is making should be met by a corresponding effort on our part. If we do not adequately meet it Germany may acquire such a dominating position in the eyes of our Allies and of neutral Powers.as will lead to an inconclusive peace, which fbr us would be almost as bad as defeat. In short, we must give the enemy a sound beating, and provided we make available a sufficient number of men we can hope to do this.15. We must, however, carefully guard against jumping to the conclusion that a sound beating is the same thing as winning the war outright this year. The strength of the hostile troops, the amount of armaments, and the issues at stake are too colossal to justify any such conclusion. We may &quot; break the line,&quot; as it is termed, but we shall also have to break up the enemy&apos;s army, and we have very little to guide us as to what this may entail. It will depend upon the state of his morale, which in turn will be affected by his internal conditions, and upon the ability of our new and inexperienced armies to manoeuvre and fight in the open country. What Germany accomplished against Russia in 1915 and Russia against Austria in 1916 is not, owing to the very different conditions, of much help to us in estimating the nature of.the task involved in breaking up the 450 miles of strong and elaborate defences which Germany has made during the last 2  years, and in subsequently completely defeating the German Army in the open field. The war is now entering on a phase which will impose a far more severe strain on all the belligerents than they have yet had to bear, and victory will rest with that side which displays the greatest Resolution and endurance.To sum up, therefore, we need not conclude that success will be hopeless if we fail to win the war this year, since a favourable decision can be reached, if not immediately by breaking the line, by the eventual exhaustion of the military and other resources of the Central Powers.: Germany cannot maintain after next autumn all the divisions she is now forming, and accordingly from then onwards her forces will gradually diminish. Consequently we should regard the forthcoming operations not as if we were staking everything on their first result, but rather as a means of so weakening the strength of the enemy -that we may compel him to submit to peace. on our terms in the shortest : possible time ; and also as a means of preventing him from gaining his ends, of which there will be grave risk if we ourselves fail to place adequate forces in the field.I submit for the consideration of the War Cabinet that they should endeavour, as opportunity offers, to impress the sense of the above views upon the country and upon our Allies in order to prevent such possible disappointment being aroused by a continuance of the war as might end in an unsatisfactory peace.* Most of these men are physically unfit for service in the field abroad, but of course they represent a. corresponding deduction from the number of meu available for other national work.Chief of the Imperial General Staff.23rd February, 1917.
