Colnoel Jones.Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET,   /JWar Cabinet,Indian Assistance in the War.It has been impossible not, to feel at times that the Cabinet scarcely appreciated the desire of the Government of India to render all possible assistance in this war. It is not possible for us to say unaided how that assistance can best be rendered, for we do not know what are the particular needs of the Departments here, and on the other hand the power of India to increase, its contribution frequently depends upon our ability to secure in this country the machinery or other material necessary to equip India to produce an increased output.Immediately on assuming office, I. invited the Ministry of Munitions to indicate any ways in which India could be useful, and I have several times repeated that invitation to all the Departments concerned at meetings of the old War Committee. Latterly we have had very definite suggestions, and the Cabinet are aware, from papers already circulated, that India is raising fresh forces, is undertaking a substantial financial burden and is in addition ready to raise Labour Battalions as soon as we can obtain from the War&apos; Office an exact definition of their requirements and approval for the scheme of organisation and remuneration which the Government of India have suggested.But I should like to draw the attention of the Cabinet to steps which the Government of India had taken on its own initiative before the War Office demands for increased supplies were formulated. Some time ago the Government appointed a Commission to enquire into the possibilities of industrial development in India, with Sir Thomas Holland as Chairman. Sir Thomas Hollands enquires led him on the 14th January to address.a letter to the Member for Commerce, pointing out that whilst, his Commission was concerned in the main with post helium problems there were more urgent&apos; questions- connected with the; production of necessaries, in the immediate present which urgently required attention. 1 do not circulate this letter, which is very interesting but necessarily lengthy, but I should like the Cabinet to note ihe decisions taken by the Viceroy upon it as explained to me in a private letter just received dated 26di January. The telegram from this ^country asking for increased effort was sent on the 1st February, and it will therefore be seen that the Viceroy had alread3&apos;- got a firm grip of the subject, and was taking energetic action a week before he received my appeal.   He writes as follows   F&quot;I am enclosing a further letter from Sir T. Holland in continuation of his Memorandum forwarded with my letter of 9th June last.&quot; We are taking up the subject in earnest, and I am writing you a short account of what is in our minds, so that if we have to telegraph for orders you may be aAvare generally of our policy.&quot; I believe you will agree with me in thinking that we must endeavour to expand India&apos;s production to meet military requirements.&quot; We have already done much, but more could undoubtedly be done, e.g., we must take immediate steps to secure the continuance of existing factories:  &quot; (1) By securing for Tata&apos;s silica bricks, without which our steel manufacture will come to an end in four months&apos; time.&quot; (2) By increasing tanning facilities. Otherwise the production of boots and harness will be seriously handicapped.&quot; In the next place, we must take steps to enable our existing factories to increase their present output: &quot; (1) By helping to obtain plant for the Cawnpore Woollen Mills. &quot; (2) By commandeering wool to enable us to meet our requirements in blankets.ss 542 F/--F---F&apos;-F.F-F&apos;:V:
&quot; (3) By obtaining the necessary plant for increasing the output of-Government rifle factories. &quot; (4) By helping to obtain from home skilled supervision.&quot; Again we must seek new sources of supply, e.g..:- &quot;(1) By developing the handloom industry in jails and villages for themanufacture of blankets, felt, &amp;c. &quot; (2) By obtaining the necessaiy wood for rifle stocks. &quot;(3) By overcoming   the inertia   which has characterised   certaindepartments.&quot;Fourthly,.we must take steps to prevent inter-departmental competition in the same class of goods.&quot; Lastly, we want to come to a clear understanding with the War Office as to the direction in which India can best give assistance to the Empire, e.g.: Do the War Office wish us.to manufacture rails or shells, or supply the steel for shell, manufacture at home ? Or, again, do they want us to export raw hides or shall we tan them here and make them into boots, harness, &amp;c. ?&quot; We could do all these things were it not-&quot; (1) that there is no one at Army Headquarters with requisite leisure-and knowledge to tackle all these problems, &quot; (2) that these matters affect many Departments of the Government of/India, and co-ordination is necessary ; &quot; (3) that rapid decisions and prompt action are essential, and these: arenot easy to secure under the ordinary departmental methods.   -&quot;-We haveit in our minds then to create a small organisation under a capable and experienced officer to deal with these and allied questions.&quot;I am convinced that our present machinery is not suited for the purpose. We want drive, rapid decision, and co-ordination, and for this we: must endeavour to get the best man we can and put ourselves in his hands.&quot;Since this letter was written Sir Thomas Holland has been appointed to carry out the policy here enunciated.It may interest the Cabinet,&apos;to know that the Viceroy has established a Defence Committee somewhat on the lines of the old Defence Committee here for the elucidation of the problems of defence and policy. At its first sitting the chief subject for discussion was the situation in Shiraz and the future of Sir Percy Syke&apos;s force. The results of the discussion were embodied in the telegram which has ahead)7 been considered by the War Cabinet.:\-&apos;   y* y,, v. -y  y;&apos;y* A. C.23rd February 1917.     :
