83SECRETFAB CABI2TET.G.T.-17PROPOSAL TC EX^^D:::TIME TOR .SI81:00IM PFF^SAFTS-   piirASAFi:s&quot;cpn?;E i9i7.(Hote by th29 Food Controller)The sug^es t i on v- as i:iAe to me&apos; by the Board of Agriculture -after&apos; the Shooting Seasorf had closed, that tho time for killing Pheasants should be extended to the lot March.    The extension proposed is, in my vievv, inadequate, as no ouch limited extension of time during which pheasants miaht be killed would in itself meet the real needs of the case;   The depredations of these birds v/ill continue not only during the Seed time, &apos;\,ut continuously until the Harvest is secured.     Therefore to meet this situation I propose by Clause I. of the accompanying Draft Order, to e::tend the time for killing Pheasants until the:order is revoked. Clause II of the Order \.ill enable the Occupier- of land to hill pheasants in the&apos;-same.-: way and subject to the same conditions ,as  &apos; under, the Ground Game Act of 1800 he is entitled to kill hares. The immediate person to be protected is obviously the Occupier, as it is his. crops a/hieh are raided, -.T.d unless -por/er be - given&apos;. -to him to hill:pheasants: independently of any - contract to the contrary contd-ined in his tenance agreement, his interests will not be pro tected.Ministry of Pood.l*th February 1917.
