TIMBER.In order to release tonnage and relieve the congested condition of the French Ports and.Hallways it is proposed to meet the timber requirements of the British Army in France by, felling timber in that country., / The requirements of the British;Army/during I91V are estimated at 1,650,000 tons.   In order to meet this demand it will be.necessary to supply labour&apos; and plant.    The newly appointed Director of Timber Supplies, War Office, has this matter,in hand.   Fur-ther, it will be necessary to obtain permission from the French Government for the clear felling of woods within the War Zone.At present the French&apos;Government have given permission for felling the woods round Rouen;    This source of supply is obviously better than obtaining the timber from overseas, but there is Still the difficulty of rail haulage from Rouen to the Front.. . It is, therefore, suggested that the French Government should be asked to give instructions that every facility should be given to the British Army for clear felling woods in the immediate vicinity of the Line, and, further, that the French Forestry Eules, with regard to removing stumps and.generally clearing up, should be waived until after the War..VESSELS CARRYING TIMBER T:0&quot;F*AfGE.(a) There are at present 46 vessels carrying timber to France for the British Government; of these 15 are neutral ships from Scandinavia.    Their gross tonnage is 115,039 tons, and they deliver between 60,000 and 70,000 tons of timber per month in France:(b) In addition; there are 10 transports, total gross ton - nage 44,553 tons, conveying timber to France for theFrench Government. They deliver about 23,000 tons of - .   timber per month.B Whitehall Gardens, 3.W Feb. 23, 1917.
