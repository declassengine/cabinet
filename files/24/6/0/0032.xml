SECRET

G.T. 32

WAR CABINET

Neutral Shipping.

Minute by Lord R. Cecil.

Prime Minister

You will remember that at the meetings of the War Cabinet held on Jan. 29th, Feb. 1st and Feb.2nd an Inter-departmental Committee consisting of Commander Fisher, Mr. K. Hugessen, Mr. C. Hipwood and Mr. Royden were entrusted with certain duties in connection with Neutral Shipping &amp;c. A good deal has been done, but owing partly to French want of co-operation and partly to the reluctance of neutrals to offend Germany, We have not so far succeeded in obtaining the services of many neutral ships. It may well be that we shall have to come to requisitioning, but in view of the delicate position in the United States, I have not thought it right to recommend this so far. In the meantime, I have thought it desirable to strengthen the Committee by appointing Mr. Leverton Harris as chairman with instructions to report daily to me the progress made.

I hope the recent settlement of our dispute with Norway may help matters. I trust the so steps have your approval.

(Intld.) R.C.

17th February, 1917
