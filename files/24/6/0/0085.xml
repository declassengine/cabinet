[This Document is the Property Qf-IL&amp;.&apos;Btft&amp;BBft Ilsftst/a CknraraBflafeJPrinted for the use of the Cabinet.   March 1917.CONFIDENTIAL.LORD STAMFORDHAM, by instructions of the King, wrote to me recently with regard to affairs in Greece. His Majesty begged hie to consider whether, at the forth-coming Conference with the French, an effort might not be made to insist upon the French Government declaring their policy in Greece, and, if so, further to secure some assurances that the French authorities in Greece would not act independently of the other Allied representatives.I have sent to Lord Stamfordham the following reply : (Private.)My dear Stamfordham, Foreign Office, February 27, 1917.The position in Greece is undoubtedly unsatisfactory, and 1 have long thought that a serious attempt should be made to try and bring the various Powers concerned into line. The difficulties, however, are very great, because they do hot merely depend upon trivial misunderstandings which can be cleared up by a little explanation, but rather upon more deep-seated differences of outlook, which are not so easily disposed of.The Italians are anti-French and anti-Venizelist. The French seem irreconcilably opposed to the King of Greece, and General Sarrail is suspected of using a perfectly legitimate desire to secure the safety of his left flank as an anti-Monarchial instrument. The British differ from the Italians in holding M. Venizelos in high regard as a statesman aud a patriot, and they differ from the French in their desire to maintain the Monarchy, and if possible the Monarch. To add to the difficulty,&apos; the Italians suspect the French, and &quot;the French suspect the Italians, of entertaining schemes (vague perhaps, but not negligible) which will enable them respectively to use Greece as a pawn in the game of rivalry which they are playing in the Eastern Mediterranean.It is obviously a matter of extreme difficulty for three Powers holding these divergent views to pursue a single, clear, and undeviating policy. It would be difficult under any circumstances, but, with the country in which they are working in the hopelessly confused and anomalous position of Greece, the difficulty is increased a hundredfold. They have to deal with two Governments within the limits of one small country, which are violently opposed to each other, and one of which, namely, Monarchial Greece, is justly suspect. Those who, for their own purposes, wish to represent the Government in Athens as pro-German, and as only waiting for a favourable opportunity to. strike a traitor&apos;s blow, can always find good reasons for their opinion; and whatever be the exaggerations of foreign diplomatic agents (and their exaggerations are sometimes great), there is a nucleus of truth in their statements, which cannot be neglected.Such is the&apos; situation; and, when tlie Cabinet have a moment to deal with it in its entirety, it should receive the most earnest consideration. An attempt which I made about a month ago to bring the French into line was considered inopportune at the moment; and the number and magnitude of the. problems with which we have, since been dealing have made it impossible for my colleagues to give the subject the attention which it merits, and which it will, 1 hope, immediately receive.Yours sincerely,ARTHUR JAMES BALFOUR.
