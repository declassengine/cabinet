[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.] Printed for the use of the Cabinet   February 1917.CONFIDENTIAL. G.T.-3I DO not know how the question of Propaganda now stands. Bat the arguments put forward in the accompanying paper deserve careful consideration before any fundamental severance is effected between those who are responsible for conducting Foreign Policy and those who are responsible for talking about it.A. J. B.I UNDERSTAND, though my information may not be accurate, that it has been practically decided to establish a separate organisation in the Automobile Club building to manage all propaganda matters.On the assumption that this is the case, I venture to submit that such an arrange-ment is open to grave objections. V\&apos;.1. The general policy of propaganda in allied and neutral countries must necessarily run parallel with the work of the Foreign Office and be subject to the Foreign Secretary, and it is essential that the person... who is responsible; for the administration of propaganda work should be in constant touch with the Foreign Secretary and Minister of Blockade, or with those who are carrying out their directions. I-.- &apos; .   ,-&apos;-&quot; 2. One of the most useful means of propaganda is the giving of sound information to foreign correspondents, and it is, I. think, more than doubtful whether Americans and other neutral correspondents would come for information to a separate office deliberately set up for propaganda purposes as freely as they do to the Foreign Office, which is the natural place for them to seek information and facilities from.V 3. Even assuming that they would do so, the separate office would in the nature of things not be in a position to give them information on most of the points on which they desire it, which are nearly always connected with foreign policy.4 The correspondents would therefore have to be referred to the Foreign Office, and it. would be: quite impossible to attend to them there unless the News Department were maintained in its present form for the purpose, this &quot;would clearly involve multiplication of officials and consequent unnecessary expenditure. :5. It would equally be useless, so far as this aspect of the matter is concerned, to transfer the staff of the News Department to the new office, as many points about which the correspondents enquire are necessarily matters about which the other Departments of the Foreign Office concerned must be consulted before an answer can be given to them.6. We have at present organisations in several allied and neutral countries; these are now subject to the authority of the Ambassadors and Ministers in,the countries concerned under the general direction of the Foreign Office. There would clearly be confusion if they Worked independently of the embassies and legations, which must necessarily, be the case if they are to be controlled by a separate authority in London. ;;V.&apos; v-..&apos;     :-S.    .&apos;      &apos;7. The fact: that a special propaganda Department is being established will be made the most of by our enemies, especially in America, and the sedulously propagated story that we are out. to influence American opinion will make the public there suspicious of all information coming from this country-there are already signs that all the talk about the need for propaganda and the foreshadowing of a chang-i Which has been going round recently is being used against us in this way; and we have just received a strong warning on this point from a very well-informed, and friendly American. V;/.- :. - -.- &apos;    -It may he said that the existence of the Maison de la Presse in Paris shows that these objections can be got over.   But the French can safely do many things that we cannot, especially as regards America; the Mais oh de la Presse was not heralded beforehand by all the talk of the establishment of a deliberately propaganda office [289] .
which has filled Fleet Street and gone out thence to the world for weeks past ; and the questions which mainly exercise correspondents in London (e.g., the blockade in its many aspects) are much more directly matters of foreign affairs than those in which correspondents in Paris are. interested. There is no evidence that the results of the work of the Maisonde la Presse abroad are better than those that we have achieved ; in. some cases the contrary is very markedly the case. In America, where the French could do many things, owing to.their traditional popularity, which we could not touch, they have not had a success in promoting the Allied cause commensurate with it..   .       Some straightening out and strengthening of our organisation for propaganda - would be very much to the good, and it would he very desirable that whoever controls it should be able to devote his whole time to it without having other responsibilities; but he should be subject to the Foreign Secretary, and his work should be a branch of the work of the Foreign Office in the same sense as the Blockade, and not an ostensiblyA::&apos; Propaganda Office.Wellington House should be placed more directly under him; Mr. Mair&apos;s staff should be more completely merged in the Foreign Office than it is now; more rooms should be provided at the Foreign Office ; no other Departments should,be allowed to A carry on any propaganda abroad. Some of the work now done by other Departments /should be under the direction of whoever holds this pose; and those Departments which are in a position to supply material for ^jropaganda and furnish facilities for correspondents should do so as freely as possible consistently with the public interest.H.
