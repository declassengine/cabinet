ffote by the Secretary.I enclose a letter I-have received from the Secretary of the Dardanelles; Commission, covering a letter addressed&apos; -to hirn &quot;by the Chairman of the Commission.I saw:Mr. Hears on Saturday afternoon, and explained to him that the decision of the ^Isr Cabinet not to allow the&quot;. Secretaryrs Eotes/ of; the Meetings, of the Dardanelles Committee to be;furnished;to, the Commission must, be aceept-ed as final, and I suggested to:him in conversation that the Commission could really get. all the;.evidence -they re-quired hy hearing&apos;, the evidence of those Members of the Grov-ernment.of that day -;/ho were also Members of the Dardanelles Committee/   ^le hogged me   however, to lay Sir William Pick-ford1 s letter before the war Cabinet. ...I would suggest for the consideration of the -..;ar Cabinet that I might be authorised to communicate, not the detailed Secretary&apos;s ilotes, but the formal decisions of the Dardan-elles Committee ana the Var Committee to the Dardanelles Corn-mission.    There is a precedent for this in the case of the Mesopotamian Commission, which was quite satisfied to re-  .. oeive the decisions and to cross-examine Ministers about them, and in private conversation with Mr, Hears I. gather that this Yv-ouia probably satisfy the. Dardanelles Commission also.i!11 hardens , - a. ;7. 17, 1917.
CopyZ Hare Court;; Temple, E.C.. 16th February 1917.THE DARDAIfELLES 00M?JISSI0??., - -- :    - .Dear Sir &quot;Maurice,Sir William Pickford has written me a letter, of which I enclose you a copy.     I might perhaps supplement it hy drawing your attention to an extract from a letter from Sir Maurice -Bonham Carter:to me, dated 30th August 1916, in which he says &quot;I.am able to give, you,the answers to the three points raised by Lord Cromer when he called here some-days ago.   I understand from the Prime Minister; that the Ministers will have no objection to giving their evidence on oath.   Lord Stamfordham has written to me to say that the King: will release y them from their oath of geerecy for the purpose of giving evidence before ^them&quot;. -I have obtained the copy of the minutes of the War Council which were handed confidentially to the late Lord Cromer.If you can spare me two minutes I will return them to you personally.Yours sincerely,(Sgd)   E, GRIMTOOD MEARS.Lieutenant Colonel. Sir kauriee Hankey, K.C.B. 3 Whiten all Gardens.   S.W.SECRET ;   G.T-30
Queen&apos;s House,Cheyne Walk, SW.16th February 1917.ear Hears,I hope you will, be able to get evidence as to the: pro-. 88 dings of the War- Council and :. Dardanelles: Committee before long. . e cannot satisfactorily consider the conduct of the operations Jess---we know the decisions of these bodies-which are. part, of such snduct.   We have nearly finished the roatJ: of: the evidence, and I link it is important that. we - should, have information as to these atters before Mr.Churchill gives evidence&apos;... He will no doubt give 9 evidence as to the proceedings &amp;decisions and extracts from ,e minutes but thoy will be extracts taken quite; fairly but; from iv point of view we can deal -with more satisfactorily if we have .e whole.before us.Of course the most convenient.form in which we could have e information is that of a statement-supplemented by evidence Sir.. Maurice .-Hankey.as - we had&apos;::; for. the first part of the enquiry,;, at I quite see that considering all the calls upon Sir Maurice1 s m he may not be able to give us this,But we could have the information either by his evidence that of some other person&quot;qualified to give&apos; an account of the oceedings or by sending us a copy of the minutes.I understand from you that there is no objection to sending he Chairman such a copy as was done in the first part of the/enquiry ut that is of no use in the present circumstances,,. We had then an account given us by Fir Maurice Hankey and -e minutes were merely sent to . the OomdhUkon to - enable the ^airman to check this account.     At present we. have no account of such proceedings in the period between May 1915 and the evacuation r.d to send the minutes to the Chairman would give no information -0 the Commission if he might not. show them to the. Members/....I should think the Commission are Just as rmich to. be trusted &apos;ith the minutes as the-Chairman even; when - he was --&quot;as distinguished &apos;* Ban as the late lord Cromer, hut evidence, in any form will :.be luite satisfactory.Will you see Sir Maurice Hankey about it?     If you like you &apos;an show him this letter .X:y:- Yours &amp;o.(Sgd)   !7,Fickford.
