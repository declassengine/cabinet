SECRET. &apos;^? j ^      iifFrom Secretary of State to Viceroy, 26th February 1917.Private.-Your, -Army -telegram---of.&apos; 24th No. 2731. Please communicate your reasons for loss of confidence in Sykes.From Viceroy, 28th February 1917.   -..:.. Private. Your private telegram of the 26th installt, Sykes. The reasons why we have lost confidence in his political insight, his capacity for organisation, and in his military leadership, are :  (1) He showed a lack of political insight in .entrusting the Kerman prisoners to a Persian escort of 20 men, vide his/telegram 364 C,.15th July .19.16.   They have been a thorn in our side ever since their subsequent &quot;escape. -      . .(2) Mis telegrams during his march indicated often a tendency to hasty . conclusion and want of balance.(3) The optimism shown by him on his arrival at Shiraz, vide his telegram of 23rd November,; and - his - despatches of 25th November and 9th December were unjustified by the circumstances and are in contrast . with the pessimism of his telegram 1320 C. of 3.1 st December.(4) His temperament is too mercurial to deal, at all events calmly, with an ever changing situation such as exists in Persia. .(5) As regards organisation, he was asked to submit a definite scheme as soon as possible. This he did on the 16th May &quot;1916, but it was so inaccurate and unintelligible as. to be useless, and he admitted that it had been prepared under conditions: of illness and difficulty. Since then we have constantly asked him to submit; a scheme,however general, but without result, and consequently we are unable to foresee his requirements.(6) His demands too, are often premature, as when he asked for aeroplanes and tanks for a force still in embryo. ;. (7) As regards his military leadership, so far as we know he hasnot himself been in actual command in action and has only been confronted with one difficult.situation, which, resulted in our defeat and concerning which reports show that he pushed a small detachment, largely composed of Persians of doidjtful reliability, 53 -miles into a hostile and difficult country. This detachment only escaped annihilation by precipitate and disorderly retreat with loss of prestige.(8) The lack of military experience is displayed in his superficial (methods ?), such as-(a) His proposals for relieving the situation at Shiraz by:direct reinf6rce-j^^^ - m^ to 600, and again 1,000, with noapparent change in military or political situation, while. first demand for an escort of 200 men as escort to instructors, guns, ammunition, treasure, and four months&apos; supplies, showed disregard of the danger of ah.inadequately, guarded convoy ; ,(b) His demand for immediate action from .13ushire, which shows anignorance of the preparations and time required for such action, as well as the inability to realise drawbacks attendant on dispersion of force.
