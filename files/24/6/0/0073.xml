PRIME MINISTER



The following Report describes as concisely as possible the work of the National Service Department during the week ended 9th February. 

The most pressing work during this time has naturally been that in connection with the Enrolment Scheme, but as there have been only two days (Thursday and Friday) in which Enrolment Forms could be received at this Office, the work done is best described by reference to the forms and other matter sent out for distribution. Reports on this Section and the other Sections of the Office follow:-



SECRETARIAT



In addition to the departmental machinery for appointment and control of Staff, registry of correspondence etc, the Section under the control of the General Secretary comprises the following Departments whose operations may be of special interest.



SUGGESTIONS



This Department had dealt with several hundred suggestions from the public, upon various aspects of National Service. Numerous informal inquiries have been made in commercial and other circles of persons qualified to give opinions on the suggestions made, and voluntary workers outside the Department

 
Department have given valuable aid in investigating statements made by correspondents.The information gained has been digested and circulated to the Heads of the difference Sections of the Office.   The particular topics most recently considered may be summarised as being:- ,(a) Economy of labour in various trades;(b) Pooling of labour and general co-operation amongst traders;(c) Part-time voluntary work.PASSPORTS.At the invitation of the Foreign Office, the National Service Department has been represented on the Committee which advises in regard to the issue of passports and permits to leave the Kingdom.   About 15,000 applications have been scrutinised by the Department1s officers, and recommendations made, based upon the principle of retaining in this country persons within the age limits of the National Service Scheme, subject to certain exceptions, as, for instance, invalided officers and soldiers who have available employment overseas, persons requiring a change of climate for purposes of health, and others whose presence here involves a greater consumption of the necessaries of life than is proportioned to their actual or potential value to the State.Whilst objection has invariably been taken to persons leaving the country merely for purposes of pleasure, cases where there were special reasons for departure or where there2. seemed
seemed to be hardships in the refusal of the passport, have received particular attention. Other Departments of the Government notably the War Office in regard to Nurses and the Board of Education in regard to Teachers have been consulted, and the views of this Department have been explained to the Colonial Office and the London representatives of the Dominion Governments, who are of course interested in emigration.   Amongapplications Trtiich this Department recommended should not be granted there may be mentioned the following as shewing the policy adopted, thirteen from teachers, twelve from trained nurses, and eighty-three from domestic servants.GENERAL C ORRES POMDENCE.This Department has charge of miscellaneous enquiries and other letters from the public, the outstanding features of its work at present being the primary consideration of offers of administrative assistance to the Director-General and the answering of queries as to the desirability of enrolment as National Service Volunteers by persons already engaged in work which the enquirers consider to be of National importance.TRADES SECTION.This Section is engaged upon the two-fold task of preparing a classified list of Trades in order of importance, and of establish-Ing the network of Commissioners, deputy-Commissioners , and Bub-Commissioners who are
to represent the Department in its local operations/In connexion with the former duty deputations have been received during the week ending 9th February from seven Trade Associations, some of them of the first importance.     Further, in consultation with the Reserved Occupations Committee (who have been provided with accommodation at St Ermihfs) a list has been prepared of Trades in which it is thought no more male labour should be allowed to be employed and a suggested system of &quot;Priority&quot; and Orders In Council to give effect to this view, have been under consideration.The Section has been in constant-communication with Mr Appleton, Secretary of the General Federation of Trade Unions and Labour Adviser to the Department, with reference to the Labour attitude towards proposals of this kind,As regards the outside organization, the list of officers is in process of completion, and the Deputy-Director of the Section and one Assistant-Director have left London to supervise the work of the Commissioners in the South-Western, East Midlands and West Midlands Divisions, and in Wales.LABOUR ADVISER,Mr Appleton, is in regular attendance at St. Ermin!s and is engaged upon duties which may be summed up as follows :-I, To advise on all matters concerning Labour,including disputes, displacements orConferences.4. 2.     To
2.   To advise in respect of meetings, having for their object the co-operation of Labour Organizations with the Scheme of National Service.3.   To advise on correspondence from Labour Organizations or in respect of Labour problems.4.   To offer, subject to the Director-General&apos; instructions, and where necessary, personal explanations to Labour Organizations on points about which doubt exists.5.   To collect and epitomise and bring to the notice of the Director-General such printed matter as may bear upon labour relationships with National Service.    (This matter is very often in Trades reports, which do not, as a rule, come Into the hands of Governments Departments).He has also been concerned with the arrangements,for the Central Hall Meeting, and has interviewed representatives of Labour organizations non-conformist ghurches and Insurance Companies, all of whom have means of advancing (or retarding) the Department1s efforts.ENROLMENT SECTIONS.This Section has been heavily engaged throughout the week in work connected with the inauguration of the Enrolment of National Service Volunteers, conferences being constantly in progress with other Government. Departments, particularly the Enrolment Exchanges of the Ministry of Labour.   The work accomplished during the week so far as it can be summarised in figures, is as followsEnrolment
Enrolment forms distributed 2,192.000Posters distributed 201.185Enrolment forms receivedcompleted (8th &amp; 9th Feb.) 7.294The Section has also dealt with a number of letterscontaining offers of service, mostly receivedbefore the enrolment were issued, and has,further, arranged for the insertion of advertise-ments, occupying from half a double column to afull page, in 104 daily papers (two insertionsa week) and 65 weekly papers.Preparations have also been made to dealwith the replies to the letter issued by theLocal Government Board and Local Authorities withreference to the National Service Scheme andsuggestions are being drafted for local committeesin connexion with a recruiting campaign.AGRICULTURAL SECTION.This Section has taken part in the discussion of the terms and conditions which should form part of the Director-General *s appeal and has been in constant communication with the Employment Exchanges of the Ministry of Labour with reference to the rules required for enrolling and trans-ferring Volunteers.   The problem of transfer has required special arrangements so far as Agriculture is concerned, inasmuch as it is an industry whose operations cannot be centralised and one for which, moreover, the Employment Exchanges have not so far been able to devise such complete machinery as has been set up for dealing with persons engaged In other industries. - (6)
The machinery proposed to be set up by the. Department to supply this want will consist of Commissioners and Sub-Commissioners.     Those for Scotland have already been appointed and are actively engaged on their preliminary duties.     They have been in communication with the Local Agricultur-al Committees and have been inquiring into and report-ing upon the needs and conditions of their districts. They are also arranging meetings to for?mrd the National Service Campaign in Scotland.This Department is in control in Scotland of the military labour and German Prisoner labour which the War Office are lending for work on the land.     The Scottish arrangements have therefore been pressed forward and the military companies will c ommenc e work as soon a s the we ather permi t s agricultural operations.     In England the control of this labour is vested in the Board of Agriculture and is not in the province of this Department.The English Agricultural Commissioners and Sub-Commissioners are in process of appointment and it is anticipated that the list will be complete within the next few days.WOMEN1S SECTIONIn the first week of its existence the i/yomen1 s Section has necessarily been somewhat pre-occupied with details of its own organisation, but it has been able to devote considerable thought to questions arising from the proposed employment of women both by the Board of Agriculture and by the War Office, and as regards the Board of Agriculture an agreed arrangement as to terms and conditions of employment/is
is nearing completion.m regards the far &apos; Offlee* the Director and deputy Director of the Women*8 Section attended a conference on this 6th instant between the Secretary of State, for far and. the Deputy &quot;Director General of National Service at which it was arranged that for services;under the War Office as under the Board of Agriculture and this- National Service department, should reerult- women &quot;by as agreed arrangementsThe Koftfenvg section .1s also in communication with leading women1 a- -Colleges,&apos; who are associating themselves with the proposals vhloh are fcolng framed for such teaching as may . be required of the women who are to.fee enrolled,.:.;&apos;?be Director.%nerfel&apos; and the CMff Secretary to the.
