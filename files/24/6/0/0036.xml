SECRET.C-.T-36 WAR CABINET.THE POSSIBILITY OF IITOREASIIIG; THE STOCKS &amp;t$WM!L. (ITote by the Secretary,)On February 2nd, I was directed by the Prime Minister to concult the Food Controller and the Minister of Munitions as to the possibility of increasing the stocks of food in this country during the next two months by a temporary reduction in the output of Munitions.   The two Ministers have furnished reports.     A copy of the Food Controller&apos;s Report is enclosed herewith, and copies of the Report of the Minister of Munitions (Paper Ho. CT.10), were circulated on 13/s/l?.The subject is so pertinent to the question of.the retstriction of imports j that I bring the reports to the notice of .the..$ar Cabinet&quot; with&apos; a view to such action as they may decide. ** * - .-(Signed)   M.P.A. HAIJKEY.     -3 Whitehall Gardens, S.F.19th February 1917.
COPT.WAR CAB BIST .; : .   - -Ministry of Food.Grosvenor House.Memorandum.Supplied by the Wheat Commission to the Order of the . -..   -Minister of Pood.3rd February 1917.Proposed Increase of Stock-. .,(1.)     The present-, stock of wheat in the United. Kingdom Is 7,673,000 quarters, or 12j-weeks&apos;! consumption. Qf this stock 6 weeksV supply represents the irreducible minimum required to avoid local famine- in view; of the difficulties of dietribution.(2)   To&apos; import this,quantity in addition to our current con-sumption would require one voyage each. from &apos;30? vessels . of -25,000&quot;quarters capacity each...    If these -vessels were sent to lorth America, the. nearest supply,&apos; the round - voyage would consumeapproximately two months. &apos;       &quot;:;&apos; &quot; y .      J^Xx^-X:(3)     North America - is the only country from, which such a-large additional supply could conceivably; be imported at short notice. The supply available in the Plate will be imported in any case. The Indian supply is -restricted-, and Australia is too far distant. A large supply, of rice-. is: &quot;available in Bur man, but this would involve either transit of the Mediterranean or a voyage almost equal in distance to the Australian voyage.(4)     The Commission do not&apos; believe such a large increase in supply is avai.^%fe^e, nor could it in practice be arranged in so short a time^if available, having in view the congestion of ports and raj Is.which would be caused by the simultaneous despatch of a large additional fleet of grain steamers at the same moment, on the same voyage.(5)     The above remarks have regard only to the United Kingdom, but it must not be. forgotten that by - international agreement, France, Italy and the United Kingdom agreed to purchase in common cere bus required for human food (wheat and maize,) and an acceleration of import to the U.K, would seem to involve a corresponding acceleration to our Allies.The piessure to increase the stocks of wheat in Italy and France pro rata with an increased stock in the United Kingdom, would; obviously depend upon the stringency of the si tuat ion, and any indie at i on on the part&apos; of - Hi s: Maj esty&apos;s Government ;that the situation demanded emerge no yv-would re-act on the mind of the Allies. - measures(6)     The Commission are of opinion that so much additional wheat cannot be bought in.Uorth America for export in the period named, more particularly as the Allies must share pro rata in all purchases.       &apos;       &quot;The bulk of the&apos;maize available in U.S.A. for export in the next few-months.is .not of the description most suit-  . able for human consumption, and is not suitable for storage.
(7)     The Commission are not able to supply any definite calculations with regard t&amp; feeding stuffs.   The Director if Transports has informed them that they must not rely on British tonnage for the carriage of maize except in substituti for wheat.     They have replied to this communication, and awai an answer from the Director.   In the meantime, the chartering neutrals has &quot;been concentrated on the Inter-Allied Chartering Bureau, and- the Commission are informed that the steamers engaged up to the present have been divided approximately in three equal parts to France, Italy and the ftheat Executive..&apos; The share of the U.K. in the neutral steamers allotted appears, therefore, to be limited to its fraction of the allotment to the Wheat Executive-, which will be entirely -inadequate to the needs of tonnage for feeding stuffs. .. Representations on this point have already been made to the President of the Board&apos;bf Trade..-(8)    While the Commission do&apos;not think that it is conoeibably ..... possible to double the stocks in this country in two or even in. four months, they urge that&quot;, the flow of wheat to &quot;this country ought not to be checked by a restriction of&apos;finance in i-.:. the U. S,A.. or of tonnage&quot;.   &apos; In the past the tonnage requiremeir for wheat has received special consideration frcm the Trahspor&apos; Department, but if new arrangements are&apos;to be made in the &apos;. .      future this appears to be a convenient opportunity to assure -to v,heat. a recognised prior .claim on tonnage until- an adequate reserve stock is established.&apos;..-&apos;&apos; (Sgd)A,G.Anderson.(Sgd)   -DEVOHPORT.. &apos;&apos;;;/:---.;v-\;-; 8.3.17.
