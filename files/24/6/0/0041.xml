More petrol is heing consumed than is brought into the country, and the stocks in this country are rapidly deminishing, as the following figures will show:-9th December - 37,450,839 gallons16th       M - 36,168,$39     &quot;23rd       &quot; -    &apos; - 35,424,325     u30th       &quot; - 30,822,430     H6th January *- 28,650,839.    n13th      &quot; - 25,966,716   . nIt is very unlikely that the same amount of tonnage for carrying petrol will he available during the current year1, in fact-there is ample evidence to the contrary.   It is therefore imperative that the consumption of petrol must he still further restricted and I have instructed the Petrol Committee to adopt more ! stringent measures in order to bring about an immediate reduction in the tot al monthly allowance for all purpose s othe r than the Army and Navy.   It is estimated that it might be possible to limit these requirements to 8,000,000 gallons per month,; which would reduce the total consumption (including naval and military      ; requirements) to about 164,000,000 gallons per annum, but to make a reduction below this amount would seriously disturb:the busi^-ness of the country hy entailing ;a very serious diminution of omnibus services, practically a complete stoppage of all private cars, a further curtailment of taxi-cabs, and a reduction in the number; of cars used for commercial purposes. JThe users of petrol have during the last six months been subject to severe restrictions, resulting in many cases in con-r siderable hardship, and serious protests have been made hy a large number affected hy these regulations,     A further limitation will undoubtedly revive these complaints, and pressure will be brought to hear for some relaxation.     It will probably be suggested-that if greater economy in the use of petrol were exercised by the Government Departments, particularly the War Office and Admiralty, more: petrol would be available for the essential needs of the country,   .. I therefore; suggest that the attention of.these Departments should be called: to the extreme :importance;;of: taking;every possible step to keep their consumption of petrol within the narrowest possible limits.- . - - (Initialled)    A.H.S, / !- Bpard of Trade.&apos;      Shd February 19171,350,000 gallons per month 300,000        &quot; &quot;      : &quot;450,000       &quot; &quot; &quot;5,200,000       &quot; ..&quot;       *3,200,000       &quot;        ;&quot; &quot;1,500,000 &quot;   V    &quot;

We have, however,again reinforced our instructions, and hope they will lead to every, care being exercised in the use of - petrol.-.As the Director General of Transportation has asked for a thousand lorries in connection with his. work of road construction there will necessarily be some considerable consumption of petrol on this service.,&apos; Yours ever,,(Sgd).

Master ton Smith.
First Lord,With, reference to your minute of the 8th February-asking for a report;whether any further reduction in the con-sumption of petrol by the Admiralty is possible, the following ia a summary of what has been done and the further action I am proposing to take:- .(1)   Special attention has been called to the utmost economy that is necessary in the consumption of petrol and how imperative it is that its use should be restricted to absolutely essential requirements.    Instructions have been,given that tho use of me oh ani o al r o ad transport should be reduced as much as possible cy utilising railway transit, particularly when it is desired to send stores long distances.   Orders have been given for the employment of motor-cars, lorries, &amp;c for the conveyance of officers and men on duty to be restricted to those occasions when other means of travel are not available, or when any saving of time shich may be gained; by the use of motor transport is absolutely essential in the Admiralty interest.,.  As regards motor road vehicles, logs are kept giving full details of Journeys Ac. These are carefully scrutinised../-(2)   As regards vessels using petrol and other liquid fuels, special instructions were issued in August 1916, that these vessels are not to be requisitioned without prior Admiralty sanction, and that wherever boats were required for auxiliary purposes, endeavour is to vbe made to obtain ooal burners.   All Auxiliary Patrol vessels which were privately owned have been paid off and the resultant saving in this particular instance was about 4,600 gallons of petrol and 3,000 gallons of paraffin monthly.   It was also arranged,; in order to save tonnage,, that as far as possible, all petrol consuming services (aviation, motor-launchea &amp;c) in the Mediterranean were supplied direct from, stocks derived from Eastern sources of supply and held in Egypt, instead of the petrol being exported from England.(3)   The Admifajt^y Motor Transport Committee has been actively engaged for - sometime past in checking: the unnecessary consump-tioh     ^ti?tf^&apos;:jxi^t*r-vehicles.    Statistics are, unfortunately,. n%t av^ia&amp;le,   nor are such;details available as to-permit an estimate, to be given, as asked by you, of the total economy realised in petrol expenditure.     llo criterion is furnished   by the survey of the total issues, month by month, as the continual addition of motor launches to the Patrols has led to a steady increase in the aggregate requirements, which in turn obscures any reduction which may have been effected in other services.The actual expenditure of petrol ^n the home stations by naval services during January amounted, to about 600,000 gallons, and there is no doubt that an advance oh this figure must be looked for in thfr 0pring, owing to the increased requirements ior aviation, mo^r-launches &amp;c.,A special paper has been sent to the Air Department calling attention to the serious view taken of the petrol situation, and asking what further steps - can be taken to restrict expenditure, in motor transport, and also for an estimate of monthly require-foents for aviation purposes generally during the: coming six months.
, I propose to isaue a further,Weekly Order drawing attention : :to the importance of ohserving the most scrupulous regard to :, economy in the use - of petrol, paraffin, and other liquid fuels.- As regards.expenditure.of-fuel, in motor-launches, an invention is now in, use whereby mixed fuel.; is used, :8,nd very ^reat saving . thereby made, but I am calling attention to the necessity for the strict supervision ;of; the^servicea&apos; ;on; whic^ motor-launchesare employed, any such employment as the conveyance of officers and men, duty boats for harbour use &amp;c. being strictly forbidden; also that;^economy/shall-be; exercised In: the speed ^t which these boats are run, in order that it shall at all times be as low as p o s s ible, cons is te nt with, the ir. ef f i cient perfo man ce of duty, f u 11 : speed only to be used in case&apos;.,of. actual necessity.(initialled)   L.K.16th February 1917
