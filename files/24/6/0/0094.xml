G.T. 93.SECRET0. 1/86/853&apos;. APPENDIX II ;(a). V/ ------Note &quot;by the Chief of&apos;the Imperial General Staffregarding the Calais Agreement of 27th February 1917 t------1. As my signature is appended to the CalaisAgreement of the 27th ultimo regarding the future relationsbetween Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig and General Nivelle, theI ask/permission of the War Cabinet to explain that the signature does not mean that I approve of the principle under-lying the Agreement.     The Prime Minister informed me and Sir Douglas Haig at Calais that the principle is, as decided by the War Cabinet on the 24th ultimo, that General Nivelle should be in command of the French and British Armies during the battle in question, and that Sir Douglas Haig should carry out the orders of General Nivelle in the same way as they would be carried out by a Commander of a Group of French Armies.2. It is obvious that I am not in a position eitherto approve or disapprove of the principle the War Cabinet decided to adopt, because I am not a Member of the War Cabinet;   my advice was not asked when the question was discussed by the War Cabinet,; nor had I any opportunity of giving it as I was not present at the Meeting, having previously been told by the Secretariat of the War Cabinet not to attend unless I had anything special to bring forward. The first intimation I had that any such change in principle was contemplated either by the British or the French Government was when I receive General Nivelle&apos;s proposals at 9 p.m. on the first day of the Conference.     (As the War/Cabinet ;. know, these proposals were not accepted by the
Prime Minister. Other proposals were drafted under his direction by Sir M.Hankey, and these, with certain additions made by myself and General Nivelle, eventually formed the Agreement signed.)3.    My opinion, as. I informed the Prime Minister at the time, is that unity of effort in such a vast battle could be adequately ensured without absolute unity of command (Waterloo is an example on a small scale), and was in fact appropriately ensured by the instructions given by the Secretary of State for far to Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig when he assumed command of the British Armies in France, and that Sir Douglas Haig might be completely trusted to support and co-operate with General Elvelle to the utmost extent of his power.     Further, I pointed out that the War Cabinet had already very strongly emphasised the necessity for Sir Douglas Haig supporting General Nivelle in every possible way by their decision of the 17th January last, and that this decision had been communicated to the French Government.    I also stated that it was xsxy difficult to see any practical alternative between allowing present arrangements to stand and permanently placing the British Armies completely under General Nivelie * s command.4.     It seemed to me that the principle adopted was a dangerous one, because it might prove to be the thin end of the wedge which the French have for long desired to obtain for bringing the British Armies in France under definite French control, and I suggested to the Prime Minister that it would be difficult to justify departing from the principle once it is established, because if the arrangement made is the best for one battle it can be argued that it will be best for all.    I also stated that our Offleers and men could not be expected to fight nearly as well under a foreign Commanderj   that the Dominion Governments might object; and that entirely to entrust the fortunes of this great battle to a foreign Commander, who as yet has had no/
opportunity ..osf proving his fitness for the position, was a serious step viewed from the standpoint of the Empire.    I also mentioned the legal aspect of the case, which is that no British Officer can be placed under the orders of any officer not holding His Majesty1s Commission.     This, however, may be met by the phrase &quot;conform to the orders&quot;.   I do not know whether this is so or not.5.    The Prime Minister was unable to accept my views and deemed it necessary, in pursuance of the .War Cabinet decision of 24th February 1917, to lay down the provisions contained in the Agreement, one of which is that Sir Douglas Haig should &quot;conform to the orders&quot; of General Mvelle during the battle,  subject to the proviso recommended by me and. given at the end of paragraph iv of the Agreement.6,   I trust that I have now made it clear that I did not,and in fact could not, agree with the principle of placing theBritish Armies under General Mvelle, and therefore that my merelysignature means that the precedure laid down in the Agreement appears to me to be the one best suited to give effect to the principle which the War Cabinet had already decided to adopt.7.   I ought to add, with reference to Sir Douglas HaigVs views, that he informed me at Calais that he clearly understood the instructions of the War   Cabinet regarding the forthcoming operations as previously communicated to him; that he would do his utmost to meet those instructions;and that he did not think it -as for him to take part in any discussion as toany further arrangements the War Cabinet wished to make with the French; but that if they -decided to give him other instructionsas to his relations with General Mvelle he would of course endeavour to carry them out to the. best of his power.   He alsogave me the following note in regard to the proposals put forward by General Hivelle which, as the Prime Minister
informed the War Cabinet on the 28th ultimo, would have meant the abolition of the British Commander-in-Chief,  and therefore he refused to accept them:-&quot;C.I.G.S.    27th Feb.    I have in the short time available considered the decision of the War Cabinet (of which Mr. Lloyd George informed us last night) to place the British Army in France under the orders of the French Commander-in-Chief, and the proposals of the French to give effect to that decision.&quot;In my opinion there are only two alternatives, viz,   :-&quot;1. To leave matters as they now are,  or&quot;2. To place the British Army in France entirely under the French Commander-in-Chief.&quot;The decision to adopt the second of these proposals must involve the disappearance of the British Commander-in-Chief and G.H.Q..   What further changes would be necessary must depend on the French Commander-in-Chief and the French Govern-ment under whom he acts.&quot;So drastic a change in our system at a moment when active operations on a large scale have already commenced seem to me to be fraught with the gravest danger.&quot;(Intlld)    W.R.R.2nd March 1917.
