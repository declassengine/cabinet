Sjj 0 gjj T, S.H.-81WAR CABINET( EEZG0YM5NT OF PRISONERS OF TAAR(Note by tlie Secretary)In tho accompanying communication from the prisoners of war Employment Committee, wo points arc raised.First:-   Y/hother in view of the demands for labour being in excess of the available supply, it would be possible to augment from Prance the number of Prisoners of War in the United Kingdom.Second:-&apos;   A suggestion that a selected proportion of 12,000 Turkish Prisoners in Egypt might be sent to prance, thereby releasing German Prisoners (already in France) for transference to this country, or alternative^ by the transference of German Prisoners that may be taken in future.On tho second point Sir H, Eelficld, Director of Prisoners of V7ar has been consulted and has replied that there was no objection in principlo, but the Field-Ilarshal Commanding in Chief British Expeditionary Force in France and the foreign Office had not been consulted.   Ee understood that only combatant prisoners were referred to, and there were no means of ascer-taining the number that v/ould be available when the selection advocated by Sir M,, Sykes on pounds of health and origin had teen made.   Ho considered that the French could not reasonably object seeing that they had already asked us to transfer their hrrkish prisoners to them for employment in- France, - . He laid stress, however, on the -importance of not permitting rrurkish prisoners, if employed in France, to be handed ever to the French,(Signed)    11.P.A.KAIE3Y,Secretary.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.T;,.28th February, 1917... .
PRISONERS OF WAR EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEE



War Office, 

Whitehall, S.W.



20th January, 1917.

Sir,

I am directed by Mr. Hope, as Chairman of the above Committee, to state for your information that the number of Prisoners of War applied for by Government Departments alone for the most urgent war purposes, already far exceeds the available supply. Under these circumstances, I am to enquire as to whether it would be possible to augment, from Franco, the number of Prisoners of War in the United Kingdom, especially such as are skilled in Agriculture and Engineering.

I am also asked to state that in this connection the attention of the Committee has been drawn to the large number of Turkish Prisoners of War in Egypt (estimated at 12,000 and believed to be unemployed), and it has been suggested that a certain selected proportion of such prisoners might be sent to France, thereby releasing German prisoners for transference to this Country, or alternatively rendering available for transference, German Prisoners that may be captured in the future.

I am requested to forward this suggestion for consideration and to ask for any remarks upon which the War Cabinet may think fit to make.



I am, 

sir

Your obedient Servant,

(Signed) G.D.ROSEWAY.



The Secretary, Committee of Imperial Defence, 

2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.
