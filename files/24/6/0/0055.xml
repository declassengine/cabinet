Casino el JoneCirculated-by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.     /3From Sir C. Marling, His Britannic Majesty&apos;8 Minister at Tehran,8th January 1917.Poyogovrski of Russian Resht-Kasoin Road Company is applying for concession for Enzeli-Teheran and for Askabad-Meshed Railways.Very Confidential. I have reason to believe negotiations will be pushed on rapidly in the hope of concluding them before agreement is reached regarding powers of financial commission so as to obviate submission of terms of concession to Commission.(? Russian Minister) presumes there would be no objection to our proceeding with German mining concession as suggested in my telegram No. 11.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department,l$th January 1917.Foreign Secret. Marling&apos;s telegram No. 15. Please telegraph your views from Indian standpoint as to what should be attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards Askabad-Meshed Railway.From Viceroy, 22nd February 1917. (Repeated to Tehran.)Secret. Your telegram of 16th January. Askabad-Meshed Railway. We have always regarded Russian railway, extension - towards Meshed as inevitable, and think Mis MajestyV Government should accept position provided (1) that Russians agree to adopt reciprocal friendly attitude towards our enterprise in the South; (2) that nothing is done in connection with Askabad-Meshed Railway likely to upset relations with Afghanistan ; indeed in view of excitement recently caused in x\fghanistan by our military activity on North-West Frontier we should deprecate any actual work being started till after war. Amir has guaranteed neutrality so long as Afghanistan is not molested or threatened. War party would certainly try to interpret new railway as threat and might thereby seriously embarrass Amir.
