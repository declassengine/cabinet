February 19.1.7. :-:confidential.i submit a memorandum-&apos; on certain aspects of a separate peace between austria and &apos; the allies.if the allies were certain that the resultof the war would be so decisive that they would be. able to impose their, own terms on the central powers, i still believe that the solution outlined in the paget-tyrreli memorandum is the best for the future of europe.   but if such terms are. unlikely to be secured in their entirety, or if a different solution would materially shorten the war, the possible, advantages ;    of a separate peace with austria by some such scheme as i have ventured to :/-&apos;- outline somewhat roughlv are, i think, worth careful examination.      v&apos;: ^--U/p:/:^ , ; e. d./Foreign Office, February 12, 1917.memorandum.from various indications-. it seems probable that it will be soon necessary :to consider in some detail the - various possibilities involved in a separate peace with austria.these aspects, although they may be divided into diplomatic, military, naval and economic, are so much interwoven that&quot;their separate consideration is somewhat difficult. the general reasons, however, which will lead austria to make a separate peace seem to be:-i. that she is exhausted both militarily and economically, and sees no prospect of eventual victory. \;,- /*&apos;./:-&apos;. b^y^Uy-^-^-y-y2. that she hopes to obtain better terms now than she will at any later period of the war.3. that she is intensely anxious to. throw off german domination, and feels that the only method of doing so is by making a separate peace with the allies.from, the point of view of the future of foreign policy, it is clearly to our advantage to encourage an absolute, breach between austria and germany. if austria now concludes with the allies negotiations for a separate peace, a feeling of hostility will be created between the two countries which will take years to dispel. it is probable that: some south german states, such as bavaria, will turn towards austria, but even if this does not happen, a permanent and powerful barrier against the german Drang nach Osten will have -. been created. this aspect of a separate peace with austria does not probably need emphasising. --&apos;;;/;:?-&apos;:-- l/v:&apos;/the hostility which.would exist between austria and germany would be: increased if the position of. the non-german, nationalities,---which-at present form part of austria-hungary, could be strengthened.: this might possibly be effected were the jugo-slav parts of austria made into a separate kingdom, with, exactly the same rights within the austrian empire as those now possessed by hungary. similar, rights for bohemia should also be secured. austria hungary: would thus be composed of four separate autonomous entities united under the persoual sceptre of the hapsburgs/ the magyars may be expected to offer opposition to any such proposals, biit the sympathies of the present austrian emperor and government are almost certainly in. favour of some solution on the above basis, and it would probably be more palatable to hungary than that the territories in question should be entirely-detached from austrian rule.it would, 1 think, be possible: io.; peisuaue ill-.- austrian jugo-rfiavs to adopt such a scheme, as there exists a strong current.o! opiuion among them, which, on religious and other grounds, opposes unio,(. with, tiie.o-oho ;ox and more backward serbs.the chief difficulties in the way or uoud uuing a separate peace with austria lie s  &apos; [324 b
In the agreements which, we have come to with Italy and Roumania, and the hopes which nave been held out to Serbia. It is therefore worth wliile to consider how each of our Allies would regard a separate peace with Austria.France, Belgium, and Portugal would certainly welcome . a separate peace with Austria, because it would hasten a German defeat and. shorten the war. Japan would also favour it for similar reasons, but perhaps mainly because she would be then certain that her Allies would win.. There remain Italy, Serbia, Roumania. and Russia.Italy.-Italy is at present in a very, difficult position as regards her supplies. I understand that the Admiralty are of opinion.that it will be difficult to give Italy adequate help in this respect. A considerable peace party exists in Italy, and if events took a bad turn this party might come into power, and might themselves endeavour to make a separate peace with Austria; provided the latter would cede the Trentino. There is also distrust of the Jugo-Slavs, which affects even such men as Baron Sonnino, and there is much opposition in Italy to the creation of a strong independent Jugo-Slav state. I venture to: think that Italy would prefer an autonomous Jugo-Slav kingdom under Austria to a Jugo-Slav state hi which Serbia played the predominant role. Italy would therefore be likely to accept the principle of an Austria-Hungai^ composed of four states. Austria would have to cede the Trentino, which, she is probably willing to do, but Italy would also endeavour to obtain Trieste. If Austria will not cede the latter town it might be feasible to turn it into a free-port.Italy would therefore probably have to forgo Istria, Pola, and that part of the Dalmatian coast which she obtained under the London Convention. This would of course arouse hostility in nationalist and naval circles in Italy, since Italy would not secure the absolute naval supremacy of the Adriatic, at which she aims ; but if Austria yields &quot; Italia irredenta,&quot; why should not the long outstanding quarrel between the two countries be healed ? They will inevitably be drawn together in the future by mutual dislike and fear of Germany.Italy&apos;s position at the present time is not so brilliant that she can afford to insist on a continuance of the war till all her demands are satisfied. A separate peace with Austria would secure to Italy the large sphere of influence which she is to obtain in Asia Minor, and which, as Baron Sonnino himself has stated, seems, in present circumstances, doubtful of attainment.: -.;It is possible even that other compensation might be found for Italy such as an extension of her sphere in Asia Minor, or in Albania, or by the cession to her of British Somaliland.Serbia. Austria will have to cede to Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and a portion of the south coast of Dalmatia, so that Serbia shall have reasonable access to the Adriatic. It is probable that the part of the Dalmatian coast which was to fall to Serbia under the London Convention would be sufficient for this purpose. Serbia ; would thus acquire ^a large extension. of territory. There will, of course, be a large party in Serbia against any proposals which d o no tin elude Jugo- Slav unity but, as already stated, the Jugo-Slavs in Croatia and SJavonia are of a different religion and of more advanced civilisation than the Serbians. M. Supilo, the Jugo-Slav leader here, has admitted that if a plebiscite were taken the inhabitants of these territories would probably vote against union with Serbia, though he asserted that this would be due to Austrian machinations. If it were necessary to find further compensation for Serbia-and it may well be thought desirable that for. future European stability part of Macedonia should pass to Bulgaria-the union of Montenegro with Serbia would appear to offer a solution.It is probable that Russia would be in favour of proposals such as are here put forward, as the Orthodox :party in. Russia are opposed to a Serbia which would include Croatia and Slavonia, being afraid that Serbia would lose her strictly Orthodox character and be far Jess amenable to Russian influence.: Boumania.-Roumama: is the most difficult of all the Allies to deal with, as her demands entail the cession not only of Transylvania, but also of a large strip of Hungary itself, to both of which claims it is obviously impossible for Austria to assent. It is therefore necessary to consider if there are any possibilities of coming to an arrangement with Romnania. Roumania is in a precarious position. She might not be unwilling to stop fighting if she were certain that she had actually gained material advantages from her entry into the war. It seems likely that Austria would agree to certain rectifications of boundaries, especially in the direction of the Banat, and. would give Roumania guarantees for the just treatment of Roumanians in Transylvania and Hungary, and accord to these bodies various local privileges.   It
3 ::.ymight even be possible.to secure local autonomy for Transylvania, where the principle of autonomy is still:strong. ; Roumania would also be entitled to full compensation by the Allies for the material losses she has undergone. But even suck advantages would hardly prove sufficient, and the only possibility would seem to be that Russia should be persuaded to surrender a portion of Bessarabia.to Roumania. Sucl a cession would be very popular in Roumania, and, from a military point of view, could scarcely be detrimental to Russia. It might be advisable, in order to avoid the appearance that the Allies had broken their pledges to Roumania, to try to get Austria and Roumania to agree that the inhabitants of Transylvania should be allowed themselves to choose whether they would prefer to remain under Austrian rule or be transferred to Roumania, as it is stated, though I do not know whether the statement is reliable, that if a plebiscite were taken the majority would be in favour of the former alternative.::&amp;ss(fl,-Under tlie scheme here outlined, Russia would have to cede part of Bessarabia, and would apparently obtain no compensating advantages. The Russian general situation would, however, be so much improved that the sacrifice she would be called upon to make is in reality a comparatively small one.Russia would be absolutely assured of Constantinople and the Straits.Poland would receive Galicia and the German provinces, and be united by a personal tie to the Russian Throne.Russia would secure her sphere of influence in Asia Minor, and would recover her dominant position in the Balkans.It seems possible that if Russia could be persuaded- of the tremendous military advantages and certain gains assured to her by a separate peace with Austria, she might be willing to make the necessary cession of territory to Roumania.It may of course be objected that if Austria made a separate peace with the Allies, Russia and-Italy having secured their main objectives would no longer continue the war against Germany with all their power.   I believe this to be a mistaken view.There is great hatred of Germany in the Russian army, and it is clear that till Germany is completely defeated Russian possession of. Constantinople and. of her Asia Minor sphere will be insecure, and the German provinces will not pass to Poland.The same fact applies to Italy as regards her sphere in Asia Minor to which she attaches great importance. It is true that Italy would no longer be fighting on her own front, but there seems no reason to suppose that she would not be perfectly willing to give the Allies all the help she can in the.West.- From a naval point of view I suppose that the Mediterranean question would be far more easily solved, as it would be difficult for German submarines to find satisfactory bases if the use of Austrian /territories were denied to them.It has been suggested that if Austria made a separate peacewith the Allies she would attach to it certain reservations, such as free communication over Austrian territory of troops/munitions of war, &amp;c, between Germany, Bulgaria, and Turkey. It is surely unlikely that Austria Would even endeavour to make any such reservation; If Austria makes a separate peace, it will be to her. advantage to see Germany defeated as .soon as possible and German influence dimmish in Turkey. It must be obvious that the.Allies will not accept such a reservation, and Austrian dislike of Germany would not allow any such stipulation to stand in the way of a separate peace. If this view is correct, it would seem that the withdrawal of Austria from the war would result in the severance of communications between Germany and her remaining allies. &apos; This must have a very serious effect on both.Turkey and Bulgaria. :&apos;-P//;/\\In any event, the Allies will still have a very considerable lever over Austria-Hungary through the blockade. I assume that if Austria withdraws from the war a rationing policy will be pursued as in the case of other neutral countries ; a considerable time must elapse :before the population can receive an adequate supply of foodstuffs. / Food can. only come from Russia, Roumania, and overseas, and as it does not seem possible for the first two countries to supply su fficient .quantities, control will ultimately rest with the Allies, who could thus. exert pressure whenever: desirable. It almost seems possible that Austria in making peace might be induced, to adopt an attitude of friendly neutrality, and, if so, a new supply line might be opened tip between Russia and her Allies.I understand that, from a purely military point.of view, the withdrawal of Austria from the war is held to be advantageous.It has, however,.been thought possible that an armistice would be necessary to allow Austrian troops to be disentangled from Germau. I confess, that I do not see why this should be, nor do. I think that Austria would advance such a proposal, as 1324] &apos;    / b 2
she would know that it would: not be entertained by. the Allies. Such assumptions appear to be based on the proposition that&apos;-Austria, if she makes a separate peace, will still desire Germany to win; a proposition, which seems to me.to be fallacious, if only because of the revenge which Germany would wreak on Austria in such an event.The military factors involved do not, however, come within the compass of this paper, and have no doubt been carefully examined by the General Staff.A more important objection seems to be the possible leakage that would result with respect to the blockade.. I fear some leakage would be inevitable, though, as Austria appears to be denuded of raw material,, she will, to a very great extent, be dependent on overseas supplies. We ought, therefore, by proper precautions, to be able to reduce such leakage to a minimum.I would, however, submit for consideration that the very important advantages to be gained entirely outweigh this particular disadvantage. Perhaps the Minister of Blockade might be asked to furnish his observations on this point.E, D.Foreign Office, February12, 1917.. Minutes.Mr. Balfour,I have read with great interest Sir Eric DrummoncPs admirable memorandum on certain aspects of a separate peace between Austria and the Allies, with the conclusions of which I am in general agreement.It. must be remembered, in considering this question, that no peace can be satisfactory for Great Britain which does not successfully bar the road to Germany towards the East. It is towards the East that German ambitions and aspirations are directed, and it is there that German interests will conflict with ours, unless they are absolutely barred by other Powers opposed to them standing astride the road. This is one of the great advantages we shall obtain from the cession of Constantinople and the Dardanelles to Russia ; but it would be a still greater security for British interests were Austria also to block the road, and at the same time to act as a counterpoise to Bulgaria, the most virile and independent of the Balkan States. This can be achieved only by placing Austria in a position of complete antagonism to Germany, and, from what we hear of the dissatisfaction expressed on all sides in Austria-Hungary at German military domination and political tutelage, it need not be difficult to secure a definite result. A separate peace with the Allies would mean the crushing of Germany and the destruction of all her hopes.- It was not until the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, when Russia was humiliated by the Kaiser beyond forgiveness, that a real divergence of views showed itself between the British, French, and Austrian Governments, and the bonds of union between Great Britain, France, and Russia grew closer. It was the later development of the policy of Aehrenthal which inspired Austria&apos;s attempt, with German connivance, to absorb Serbia, and which became the real cause of the war. At the same time, there has not been the same conflict with the Austrian as with the German military and naval forces, and consequently there is not the same bitterness and hatred between the British and French towards the Austrians. In fact, we in England know that British residents who have remained in Austria-Hungary during the war have not been seriously disturbed, while the French and our troops have hardly come in contact at all with the Austrians, except possibly with a few regiments transported to the Western Front or in the direction of Salonica.Then, again, the new Emperor of Austria, who. has inherited the war. with all its miseries, is, according to common report, anxious to . commence his reign by giving peace to his people, and it is intelligible that a young and ardent ruler, wishing to throw off the German yoke and recover his liberty and dignity, should eagerly grasp the first opportunity to withdraw his country and people from the horrors and perils of a further prolongation of the war. If it be true that Count Mensdorff has been appointed directly by the Emperor to prepare the way for peace proposals, the outlook for a separate peace looks fairly promising, but we must not be too sanguine..The chief difficulties of sueh a peace lie in our agreements with Italy and Roumania and in the promises of territorial gain that have been made. It is quite clear, however, that, if the war is to be brought to a successful conclusion in the near future, both these countries must necessarily suffer some disappointment. It would be absurd to expect England j France, and Russia to continue the war indefinitely until
Italy&apos;s and Roumanians aspirations had been completely fulfilled. If Austria should, however, consent to surrender the Trentinoto Italy and that territory in the neighbour-hood of Trieste which Italy has won by her own arms, making Trieste a free port, it would be impossible to say that Italy has not gained materially by the wrar and by her late entry into it. If she realises at the same time a fair share of Asia Minor as her own territory or special sphere of influence, one may even go so far as to say that the war will have been distinctly profitable to her. One knows from precedent chat Italy would never admit that she is satisfied with any arrangement that may be made when peace is concluded, but I would be averse from giving her any further compensation elsewhere, unless possibly in the direction of Somaliland by the surrender to her. of our interests, which chiefly consist of mad mullahs and Dervish tribes, in return for a formal renunciation of all her pretensions to equality of position or to interference in the affairs of the Eastern shores of the Red Sea and of Arabia.The Roumanian difficulty is far harder of solution, but. if the Austrians would agree to the rectification of their frontier in Transylvania and if the Russians would consent to the modification of their Bessarabian frontier in the direction of Kishineff, surely the Roumanians would be satisfied with the recovery of their own territory and these important additions, together with compensation for the material losses they have suffered ?I have nothing to add to the suggestions made by Sir Eric as regards the reconstitution of Austria-Hungary in four autonomous States in personal union with the Emperor. It is a practical scheme, based on racial, religious, and political grounds and should therefore be acceptable to the nationalities involved. It seems to me that were this realised it is quite possible that the Kingdom of Bavaria might gravitate towards a Catholic Austrian Dynasty rather than to the hated Protestant Prussia. This would form a powerful addition to the Austrian family of autonomous States and would become a loss and even a danger to Germany.At the same time, the reconstitution of Serbia would entail the surrender by Austria of her two recently-annexed provinces, Bosnia and Herzegovina, while Galicia would also have to be contributed to the creation of an autonomous Poland. Thus, Austria would be called upon to make considerable territorial sacrifices, based on the principle of nationalities, and this may prove the stumbling block in the way of peace. VOur hopes of bringing the war to an early termination by the conclusion of a separate peace with Austria may consequently not be realised, but the advantages of such a policy are so obvious that it is worth our while to spare no effort to bring it to a successful issue.H.February 17, 1917.Mr. Balfonr,T have read the annexed minutes and agree with Sir Eric Drummond that, the advantages of a separate peace with Austria, if it could be obtained on any such terms as he indicates, greatly outweigh the disadvantages. Indeed, I am disposed to think that there is much to be said for the view that the settlement of South-Eastern Europe, based on a personal union of the four states under the Austrian Crown, would be better for the future peace of Europe than the creation of a new confederation of Slav States. Our experience in the Balkans of small independent kingdoms is not encouraging. Moreover, the settlement sketched by the Paget-Tyrrell Committee must necessarily end in a large increase in the European extent and power of Germany, which is perhaps not desirable.As far as the blockade is concerned, I think it will be quite impossible to continue for any considerable length of time a really effective blockade of Germany through a neutral Austria, particularly if the Balkan peninsula also became neutral. InIo doubt it might be possible, though difficult, to ration the Balkan neutral states and Austria, in respect of goods originating exclusively outside Europe, but in all the staple foods, such as corn and meat, which are largely produced in Russia, Roumania, and Bulgaria, apart from Italy, I do not see how it would be possible to establish any effective control of the imports into Austria, and consequently of the imports through Austria into Germany. At the same time, I should not anticipate that any considerable relief would he given to Germany for several months after such a peace were established, perhaps even for a longer period. It must take a very considerable time to fill up the void now existing in. Austria and the. Balkan countries, and until that was done one might
(6 . vbe fairly certain that there would be no very considerable export from them to germany. no doubt it would be equally impossible to control the export from italy of the italian products, such as silk, fruits, sulphur, &amp;c. but apart from the fact that these things, except perhaps sulphur, are not in the first rank of military importance, the demand in austria for other things would be so great that i should doubt whether it would be possible commercially to import into that country for several months anything but the first necessities of life.. i. conclude, therefore, that from a blockade point of view a separate peace with austria would certainly be no advantage, but would probably not be a grave disadvantage for some months to come. it is a question for military experts by how much the length of the war would be shortened by this event.; i am personally of opinion that, from one cause or another, the war will come to an end in some shape or form within a year&apos;s time from now. i do not therefore myself attach much importance to the prospect of the weakening of a blockade after that date, and to me, at any rate, it appears certain that the defection of all gerrnanys allies would be such a blow to her, both morally and physically, that it would greatlv increase our chance of victory.R; 0.February 19,1917.
