THE IRISH SITUATION.^     There are certain cardinal facts about&apos;the present situation as regards Ireland.(1) Ulster will not accept the.present Home Rule Bill, and cannot be coerced.  &apos; &apos;   -  /(2) Home Rule without Ulster does not meet; the realdesire of nationalism&apos;,.which is to: give some - sort of. extern-al expression and frame-work to the ideal of an Irish nation-al life. .&apos;..-.&apos;.&quot; &apos;(3) The present Bill is essentially unattractive to all sections of Irishmen..     It was framed ,&apos;;by- Englishmen to suit Parliamentary exigencies:at V/estminstor,.and not by Irishmen to suit Irish ideas or to meet Irish needs.(4) Ho British Government can solve the Irish problem by legislation, and .no British statesman can solve it by negotiation, as long -as legislators or negotiators have to deal with two sections of Irishmen equally irresi^cnsible in their demands and in their refusals.     There can be so solu-tion until Irishmen themselves..shoulder the responsibility^ tot dlsaevoting a form of government on which they can agree. The surprising thing is that anyone should ever have thought &quot;that-any other method could succeeds - &apos; Is is imaginable, &apos; for instance, that the present Constitution of the-Union of South Africa, or any Constitution, would have had the faint-est ghost of a chance of acceptance in South Africa if it had :been sent out as a ready-made Bill fro.m Westminster, known to be passed there .under .tlie auspices of either Butch or English South. Africans?..&apos;. . .Qr would its chance of accept-ance have been in the least, improved by anyefforts on the part&apos; of British negotiators,&apos;however tactful and however ,;v : well meaning?- . The only chance^; in fact,:of a settlement of the Irish problem is to tell. Iri shmen &quot;that they must, settle it themselves.[&quot; In this respect there&apos;are two points which have/bo &quot;be distinguished, and which are clearly distinguished in every existing federal government, namely, the form of government which is to be set up in Ireland, and the powers: which are to he delegated to that Government.    5he latter-is a ques-tion which concerns, the United Kingdom as a whole and affects the whole political.structure of the United Kingdom.     The former really concerns Ireland alone.     The general structure of a federal state is not affected by variety of constitu-tional form in-its subordinate governments/ - Both in the Canadian Dominion and in the Australian-- Commonwealth the provincial and state Constitutions differ&apos; very -widely;   the United States comprise a perfect museum of Constitutions;   t?\ the German Empire, comprises subordinate governments of every constitutional type rangeing   from almost mediaeval monarchies like Mecklenburg to republics- like Hamburg.     It is no concern really of the United kingdom1s what sort of government Irishmen choose to devise for themselves for Irish purposes, and if they choose to have one p. two, or three.Houses of Parliament, woman1s suffrage, proportional representation, special representation of cle3.-gy.,&quot;a scheme of subordinate provinces, or uKcme Rule;within Home Rule&quot;, that is entirely a matter for themselves, to settle.     In the very process of settling it they will nofeonly secure those guarantees against oppression, political, religious, or economic, which t;he minority will naturally&apos;desire, in the form in which they believe they will be most, efficacious, but they will also in the course of discussion surmount those prejudices and suspicions which make any Bill that is imposed on them from without susrect from the start.- But,
But, however .. satisfactory the form;of government may he, no government can really work unless it rests on soimd foundations of finance.     The finance of the present Home Rule Bill is particularly Vicious in the endless opportunities which it offers for friction and chicanery.    But no finan-cial scheme can be satisfactory under the present economic conditions of Ireland.   To put it bluntly, Ireland was not    n economically capable in 1312 of-sustaining the double burden of local and United Ilingdom government, and is still less so now.     In the United states; it is only when a territory is able to defray the espenses-of state govornment, over and above Its contribution to federal revenues, that it becomes entitled to state-hood.     On that b*dc0a financially soimd federal scheme forthe United kingdom would begin with Home Rule for England, Scotland and Wales, leaving Ireland as a federal territory.     From this essential feature of the situation there are only two practical conclusions to be drawn.    The first is that Home Rulo must be postponed in-definitely;   the second is that economic measures should be taken in hand at once, coincidently with the establishment of Home Rule, which will within a few years put Ireland on   0 an altogether different economic plane to that which it occupies at present. &apos;*There is nothing inherently impossible Hi the second alternative.&apos;   There is no inherent reason in the geographi-cal position, the climate or the soil of Ireland why it should be.so far behind the rest of the United Kingdom in its economic development, or why its ; population should bo only one-tenth that of the United Kingdom.     After all, the relative difference in the economic conditions was far less in the past, and within the memory of living man the popu-lation of Ireland was very nearly half that of Great Britain. What is required is something that has been done to a con-si dor able extent in Denmark, that was done with rema-rkable success by lord HiIner in the Transvaal after the South African war, and that has been done on a anall scale in Ireland itself by the Congested Districts Board, and,by the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society.It is this economic regeneration that Ireland really demands more than anything else, -   The whole, root of Ireland^ political grievance is tho feeling that she has been blighted by her connection wi-fch England, whose selfish jealousy under Protection, and selfish indifference under Pree Trads, have been equally disastrous tc her.     Her wonderful geographical situation as the westernmost bridge-head of Europe towards America is not made use of, the great flow of the world1 s shipping passes bjr her once prosperous     ( harbours, she is still one of the most backward of European countries, lying actually alongside of the most prosperous. It is the hope that Home Ifale will somehow or other change all thi3 and bring prosperity to Ireland that is the secret of its appeal to Irishmen.    And it is also the secret of the failure of every attempt; to arrive at a working agree-ment on Home J?ule, that while one section of Irishmen are ooiivinced that it will spall disaster to their industries, the professed Home Kulers themselves Awith the practical&quot;conditions under which Home Rule will have to be started, have no real conviction at heart that they can possibly bring about the prosperity of which they dream.    Under such conditions, the inevitable temptation is to shirk the ;respo3isibility of /attempting to find a systeaH of government for Ireland by disagreeing about some detail of any ptirticular proposal that is : saggested,?/ The only way of making agreement possible is to &apos;make the practical working prospect3 of such an :agreement genuinely&quot;attractive
to all parties&apos; concerned.     It was the practical prospect of she-ring in the riches of the Rand- held out &quot;before the other South African Colonies which helped in no small moas-ure to bring about the South African Union.Shore, are, In fact, two things essential to a solu-tion cf the Irish problem.     &apos;Ahe first is that the whole.&apos; responsibility of finding a workable form of government for Ireland must fall on Irishmen themselves.    She second is that Irishmen must be; assured before they begin their dis-oussions, that any form of government which they can agree upon will start under conditions which will give it a fair prospect of success.     If the United Kingdom is to be a suc-cessful matchmaker between Erin and Ulster, it must let them know that there is a substantial marriage- settlement coming, and then leave them a*one together.As regards the actual procedure on the political side, the difficulties in the way of any satisfactory method of . electing a Convention, under present conditions seem almost insuperable.&quot;   She easiest and most hopeful method is pro-bably that of appointing a nominated Convention, or Commission to work out an Irish Constitution.    Such a Convention should consist of 20. to 30 members, Unionists and Home Rulers- in equal proportions, and should not be confined to politicians, but should also include prominent men of statesmanlike out-look in other walks of life.    What might %e very advan-tagetus would be to add a few Irishmen who have had actual experience of the working of federal systems of government, or of the actual making of a new Constitution in the Dominion.    Men like lord Shaughnessy, Sir Tt Doherty, or Sir P. MoBride, in Cam da, Sir R. (Jar ran, one of the Secre-taries of the Australian Federal Convention, or Sir 2. Coghlan the Australian Commonwealth statistician, Sir P.PitzPatrick or Sir T. Smartt, who were members of the South African Union Convention, all these are typical men who would be of the very greatest value to any such Convention both by virtue of their special experience, and also of the fact that, though Irishmen, they would be able to take a detached atti-tude at times and to suggest workable compromises.     It would probably be one of these Oversea Irishmen who would be most suitable for the position of Chairman.     The Convention should sit with closed doors and should publish no report of its discussion.The Government would have to annoimce at the outset that the Convention would have an absolutely free hand with regard to the form of the Irish government f and that it would be prepared to accept without  iialif Ication any sort or kind of government the Convention agreed upon.    As re-gards the powers to be exercised by that government, this in strict logic ought to be a matter for a united Kingdom Convention to settle, and it is just possible that one of the consequences of any I^ish; settlement by sucha Conven-tion would be the summoning of a United Kingdom Convention to consider the possibility of extending the principles carried out in Ireland to the rest of the; United &quot;Kingdom. However, given present circumstances, it will be enough for the Government to say that, while it must reserve to itself the right to reconsider in the interests of Imwerial Defence and of the Constitution of the United Kingdom generally, the proposals which the Convention might make under that head, it was in principle prepared to consider, favourably any Scheme of powers enumerated by the Convention which did not. go beyond those conferred upon Ireland by the existing Home Rule Bill.     The only condition which the Govei^nment should lay down on that subject is that political and financial responsibility must go hand in hand in any scheme of HomeRule
Kale framed by the Convention, and that whatever powers are demanded, the&apos; money, required for their exercise will have to be provided out of Irish revenues without interference with the normal raising of United Kingdom revenue in Ireland. This of course applies to the eventual working of the new     s Constitution  when the measures for the economic transform-   J ation of Ireland have taken effect.;  - lor the intervening period, the Convention would! have to: devise some form of transition finance.As regards the measures of economic transformation, which would be required to. carry out- the policy advocated, the first essential is to fit out Ireland with- a complete working plant of mod em civilisati on. -   Tho f oundati on of modern civilisation is up-to-date transportation.     As long as Ireland is treated as a separate island, off the main track of British commeice and industry, she can make no progress.    The first and most important step is to make the Irish railway system ran integral part of the rail1?ay system Q Of the United Kingdom.:   To do this it is necessary to link it up by at least half a dozen train ferries with different parta of Great Britain, -and/to bring the Irish railvyay system itself into line with the British railway systems both by reducing the gauge to normal gauge, end - by bringing the standard of the permanent way up to British standard.    d/hen this is done, there should be no farmer in Ire Jnd who cannot get his produce run straight through, without any iurther handling, from the nearest station to the town in Great Britain whore it is to be sold, and no manufacturer in any part of Ireland who cannot get his coal or other necessary materials direct from the mine or factory in Great Britain. Hore than that, once this unity of railway systems is achiev-ed, it also becomes possible to utilise the magnificent har-bours of the West coast of Ireland. 500 miles nearer America than Itiverpool or Southampton/ as the terminal harbours for the greater part of our fast transatlantic traffic.    The constmction of at least two harbours/, one for the Canadian and one for the ITew/fork traffic...and the starting of sub- , sidising if requirod of express, steam-ship services, is another essential step to the economic opening up of Ireland. Schemes of canalisation and drainage on a comprehensive . scale, the /harnessing of Irish water-power,&apos; the opening up of mineral deposits, afforestation, e^rperimantal factories for the utilisation of peat, the startingon&quot; a large experi-mental scale of new industries and now forms of cultivation (such as for instance tobacco and Mew Zealand flax), coupled i where necessary with subsidies or-protection in the United Kingdom&apos; tariff - all those things would-naturally be essen-tial items in the programme of bringing Ireland up to date &quot;With tho rest of the United Kingdoms v.- A special iri sh ; Development Commission would have to be appointed for this purpose and allotted whatever money Was required to carry out :the work,-: and&apos; overyarrangemeaG -would, have to be made in the drnmedi&amp;te future to secure the necessary labour immed-iately the war; came to an end,::   Such a scheme of:re-con-&apos; struct!on on a large . scale would due identailyform a very-useful temporary.-&apos;-reservoir into ;which oho volume.&apos;-..of labour liberated by demobilisation, cuull do: directed-wending &quot;the re-establishment of normal^ industrial: conditionsdy   It would, of course,: be essential to thedsueeess ofthe whole scheme     I of settlegsn o.: that the main out I ine o f-.- the pr ogr omme of Irish re -Wlistruccionshould be announced at the same time as : the Convent J. on is sec up.    - There will not be a district in Ireland that will not be convinced that it is going toget
got something Out of the great.:scheme,and will not therefore do its best to create that atmosphere of expectant hope which is essential to the success of: the Convention.The Unionist party have always advocated economic re-generation as the true solution of, the Irish problem;   but ap art from one bold and sue c e s sf ul me a sure t th e Wyndham&apos; Land Act t their measures have be en too tentative and on to o small ; a scale to achieve the degree of success v/hich,is required. The Liberals have advocated self-government, but have praoti-cally confined themselves to attempting to bring forward a scheme of self-government made at Westminster which has been persistently rejected.as intolerable by one/section of the Irish people and accepted with dubious acquiescence ^oy the rest.     The conclusion here advocated is that both policies should be   carried out in conjunction and each thoroughly. Self-government,whatever its compass,&apos; shoiild be real self-government , an Iri sh me asure framed by Irishmen to suit Iri sh needs and resting on Irish revenues.     The regeneration must be real regeneration, an honest effort on a really large scale, to make good the mischief and neglect of centuries.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.(Intld.) L.S.A
