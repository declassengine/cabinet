BOARD OF TRADE,7, WHITEHALL GARDENS,LONDON, S.W.I circulate for the information of the War Cabinet the accompanying memorandum and desire their approval of the proposals made in it for the control of the coal mines.A.H.S.13th February   1917.
13th February, 1917.CONTROL OF   COAL MIES.The. powers at present exercisable, or exercised, with regard to Coal appear to be as follows&apos;Under Defence of the Realm Regulations 9 (G) the Board of Trade have power to take possession of any coal mines where, it appears to them expedient &quot;for securing the public : /Safety and -the Defence of. the Realm1&apos;.: So far this power has only been exercised in relation to the South Wales ;Coalfield.: It is proposed to apply the Regulation to all coal mines .: in Great Britain and Ireland,   Owing to the special cir-cumstances of the Irish mines it will probably be necessary to deal with Ireland separately.   It may be mentioned that the Price of Coal (Limitation) Act does not apply to Coal . v.;:.&apos;::;raised in Ireland.Where the Regulation has been applied to any mine the owner,;agent, or manager, is bound to &quot;comply with the directions of the Board of Trade as to the management and - user of the minen.   This appears to give the Board of Trade , .. complete power vdtb. regard to mining management, (except for . the requirements of the Goal Mines Act, 1911, which are Iexpressly saved). IUnder xDefence of the Realm Regulation 2 (d) the Admiralty. ..- or. Army Council, or the Minister of Munitions, or any person     j authorised by them&apos; (that is in practice the Secretaries of the. Central Goal and Coke Supplies Commitee) have, power to
give &quot;directions as.to the priority to be given in the execution of orders or contracts for tho   supply of ooal and coke .......... in accordance with their national importance&quot;.It is understood that in practice this Regulation has &quot;been interpreted as giving practically conrolete power to control -the distribution of the output of a mine, and no further power may be necessary.Under Defence of the Realm Regulation No.2 (JJ) the Board of .Trade may exercise all the powers of the Pood Con-troller under previous regulations as respects any necessary article of commerce ( other than food*)!*for the purpose of en-couraging or maintaining1 the supply of any such article&quot;..  rfnese powers are very comprehensive, including, for in- ; stance, the regulation of   &quot;the production,manufacture,treat-men t, use, consumption,&apos; transport, storage, distribution, supply&quot; etc. of any article, the fixing of maximum or minimum prices, requiring returns as to stock, requisitioning stocks, etc., and may be exercised either generally or in soecial cases,   It appears therefore that subject to the limiting words &quot;for the purpose of encouraging or maintaining the supply.of any such article&quot; there is ample power to control the distribution and consumption of Ooal so far as may be thought necessary.As regards the control at present exercised, the Coal Mining Organisation Coromittee, which has dealt since the com--mencement of the War mth all questions relating&apos; to the maintenance of&apos;the output of Coal, has not so far exercised any compulsory powers. - As soon, however, as control is assumed of any mine it will be possible to enforce their recommendations.   It would seem desirable that this Committee should in future act under the Ooal Controller, and it is understood that the Home Office have no objection. Questions relating to the recruiting of minors fall within
the purview of.the Home Office, hut in practice have largely.been referred to this Committee and should now he dealt with ;:;,by the Coal Controller.. As regards export, complete control is exercised by theCoal Exports Committee, both as regards the quantity of Coalexported and the suitability of the consignor or consignee.This control has not so far extended to&quot;questions of price,but there is nothing to prevent this.; Vaaa-/:&apos;-tl^m^/plv-!;&apos;: -. There is no. specific power to control the shipment ofCoal as bunkers in the coastwise trade,&quot; and though there isan indirect power to control foreign bunkers it has not sovfar been exercised in the case of British ships.As regards inland distribution, the Central Coal and;Coke;Supplies^Committee, and the District Committees, actinghave   77;;&apos;-, 7-7777-,.---&apos; 7-7X .    -:[ -; 7.  &apos;under: them,/it is understood, for tho most: part exorcisedtheir functions without specific: authoritynecessary orders under the&apos; Defence of the RoalmTiegulation .Ho.2 (D) have; been; issued,The price of Coal for inland consumption at the pit!smouth (except in Ireland) is controlled by the Irrice of Coal(Limitation); Act. -7 Retail prices have ;so :far ;only:;beencontrolled by voluntary agreements..It is proposed that for tho immediate present the abovenamed Committees should continue their functions for the ; generalvpurposevof -;tho;;Goal;Controllers administration 7until7ho has;had some7experienco tb guide him/ and in addition for : dealing with labour;questions ;it:^; that an Advisory. Go: 2 lit tee should be sot up consisting of ;representatives both of :the.Coal: Owners and the Liners, but.;whether, this will be done by the absolution of the present com-mittees must remain over for further consideration.-Por the present it&apos;is not proposed to interfere with thooperations of the Comrittees&quot;for:tho supply of Coal:to Pranceand Italy.;.
7The Control might he in respect of:-(1) Output of Mines (including supply of labour and necessary materials).   ... -:; (2) Conditions of employment other than health ^ -and - safety. -:(3) Distribution.&apos;..
