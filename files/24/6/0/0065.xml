His Maj;esty:: The Kingto Draw up the Statutes.)The Ocmmittee.appointed by The. King to - draw up the Statutes of the Order of the Eritish Empire, haying carefully considered the decisions of the War Cabinet ^contained in their Minutes - undated), beg to forward the following report.&apos;    The suggestion that the Honour of Knighthood should only he assumed optionally, on petitiion, places the. recipient of the Order in an invidious position...   &apos; To petition The Sovereign for an -Honour is without precedent and Would be repugnant to the majority of British subjects,Further, if the Honour of Knighthood is to be assumed optionally; no action should be taken which is derogatory to the dignity cf The Sovereign, i.c The King should.not be placed.in the position of having His Majesty \ 3 offer of Knighthood refused.     It is therefore proposed&apos;that when the Department concerned informs the prospective Member of the Order of the British Empire that his name is to be submitted for membership of the First or Second Class of the Order, the intended recipient should be asked:.to state, definitely and finally, into which category (Knighted or un-Knighted) he wishes to be received,: before, his.;name is submitted to The -y King. --^&quot;&apos;7/:^ -     &apos;As, by the Statutes of the Order, Women Members of the First and Second Classes, will - have conferred upon.. them the : privilege of calling themselves &quot;Dames&quot; . :it -will - not be: necessary for them to petitiion to assume this style.    They &apos; may do - so or not, whichever they please.:-: On attempting to. frame the Statutesin-accordance, with: ;- the directions:, of the War. Cabinet,. it v/as: found that -not only in the Statutes but also for the purposes of the Gazette and:Warrantrof Appointment some distinct designation would be -necessary for :those. who preferred not to become Knights.    To publish in the Gazette:    &quot;To -be a Knight Bachelor, Mr. A.B. -Who will not be a Knightwould,be meaningless. ...  Equallydifficult, would it be to present-a man with -a&apos; Warrant signed; -by The, King appointing him - a Knight Commander of the Order after he had definitely expressed a wish not tc be a KnightThe -letters G.C,B,E. and K.0 .B.E, are merely abbrevra-tions for Knights Grand Gross and Knights ConiCianders of the British Empire., and to allow men to use these abbreviations when they, wore not-knighted would only cause quite unnecessary, confusion and bewilder the public.     It is proposed that those -Members of the Pirst,and Second Classes who do not wish to be knighted should be appointed-Grandekembers of the Order of the- British Empire (G.M.B.E.) and Star Commanders of the Order of the British Empire (S .C .B.E.&apos;) respectively .The initials, for the various Classes will be as- follows:-

When this anomoly was found to be unworkable it was necessary to issue a new Statute cancelling this precedence, which: had mot with 3q much opposition. -1 st Class 2nd Class 3rd Class 4th Class 5th   ClassFebruary 21st, 1917 .
COPYCOLLEGE OE ARES.February 16th, IS17I EMOHAM)tfM.With regard tc the question raised by the Committee as to whether it-would&apos; be. well for the Committee to advise His Maj csty to of eat e a New Order of Knighthood, in some instances conferring the style and personal precedence of Knight Grand Cross and in ether instances the personal precedence of Knight Grand Cross without the style of Knight and several other points.I have carefully considered this matter and some of the most natural results which would attend to so great a departure from all the unwritten laws and the various enact-ments governing tho system cf Precedence.     I think the following obvious difficulties should be borne in mind by the Committee in coming to a decision.Personal Precedence is of two kinds - either hereditary, that is acquired inevitably by descent, or conferred by the Crown with the title or membership of an Order.The only instances cf the Crown granting personal precedence without a title are contained in the Statutes of Orders and /r/onfined to the lower grades of those Orders, But in no instance has precedence sc attached exceeded, infringed, or belittled in any way the precedence of those upon whom the honour of Knighthood has been conferred;    for Knighthood is the basis and foundation of all Honours. Apart from the indignity       such proposals, if adopted, would inflict upon, the whole body of Knights Bachelor, who do not appear to. have been consulted, the general public would be unable to follow the niceties of such precedence.     The Com-mittee might,&apos; I think, consider how rarely cases would occur in which a man too modest to hear himself called Sir by the Public would insi s t on precedence above Knighthood being allowed to him.     With these and many other points in mind, I have come to the conclusion that it would not be feasible for precedence above Knights but without Knighthood to be granted to the two highest grades of the new Order,I havo read the Statutes proposed by the Committee and I do not think that others could be drafted more nearly to suit the oircumstances than these, which allow full pre-cedence within the Order to unknighted Members of the first two Classes but allow only the general precedence of unknighted Members tc be immediately after that of Knights Bachelor.The Lady Members cf the first two Classes will, I understand, receive at Investiture permission to use the style of Lame.     As this is.&quot;permissive.and not obligatory no provision&apos;for any Lady objecting to the style of Bame need be made.(Signed)   A.S. SCOTT GATTY,Garter.
