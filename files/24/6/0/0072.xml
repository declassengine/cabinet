AGENDA.  AND  CONCISIONS.1. Are the Allies making the best use of their shipping; and how best can they help one another for the common cause ? *.-- 2. The question of supply of coal to France and Italy.; amounts required and meails of transport.It was agreed: (a.) That it is of paramount importance that the Governments of each - Allied country, with a view&apos; to assisting trie transport of articles which are &apos;      essential to the successful -prosecution of the war, should take immediate steps to restrict to the utmost possible extent the importation of all &quot;other; .y... articles;  ,      ......     yy,.:    v.y&quot;,        ;&apos;: y;;yOy-. ,. &apos;.&apos;,&apos;.&apos; i -       -v(6.) That fa Standing International Shipping Committee bo appointed to obtain ;. and exchange full and up-to-date information as to tlie employment of the mercantile vessels under the control of the several Allies, to ascertain whether, by co-operative programmes  or otherwise, the transport of v     essential articles can be increased,  arid   to   make such   consequent arrangements with the respective Governments as may appear desirable.It was also agreed that tlie following recommendation of the Italian Delegates should at once be brought to the notice of the Cabinets of England and France :-&quot; Considering that, in consequence of the tonnage situation, some Allied countries are already experiencing the lack of raw material and other supplies essential to the prosecution of the war and to the existence of the population;- &quot; Considering that any prolongation of this state of things is bound, within a brief period of time, to result in curtailing the powers of resistance of such Allies:    in relation to the war; ;   &apos; y- &quot; Considering further, that the agreed principle of community of resources and opportunities carries with; it also equality of privations and sacrifices ;&quot; It is agreed:    -&quot; (a.) That a;general revision of/the employment of every single unit of the entire Allied Merchant Fleet shall be made, with the object of ascertaining --. -: whether and whence it is possible to divert further tonnage to more essential requirements; ; &quot; (6.) That as the result of such revision, a redistribution of the tonnage belonging to the Allies or controlled by them shall be proceeded with, in proportion Avith..their respective needs, and in such manner as to ensure&quot;equal powers of resistance to all nations engaged in the war; ,. &quot;(c.) That any eventual deficit existing between tonnage possibilities and tlie ascertained needs of the Allies . shall be calculated ;, these needs being classified on &apos;an&apos; equal &apos;basis of priority from the. point bf view of their .    relation to the war and to the sustenance and life&apos;of the;people ; v-,v   &quot; (d.) That the Ministers responsible in all the Allied countries for the food of the people should be asked to provide, by common accord : /- ; -.  -&quot;First: for the complete elimination of all forms of consumption which are &apos;      not strictly essential ; &apos;.- .;&apos;-.&quot; Secondly :&apos;for! the -&apos; redaction &apos;also; of essential requirements, if &quot;necessary by means of imm ediate ration ing, wi thin such limits as may be fcrahd5 necessary to cope with any deficit ascertained in the manner above indicated.(To this was added a representation by General Dall&apos;01io to this effect I-&quot; If Italy, does hot get the tonnage, the necessity of which was set out in the note submitted yesterday, the production of ammunition will be stopped in March and the offensive will be impossible, the defensive paralysed.&quot;)
In general the representatives of France and Italy impressed on the Conference the absolute necessity of a constant and continuous supply of coal to France and Italy, failing which the output of munitions would be gravely imperilled.The First Lord undertook that this point would be kept before the notice of the Cabinet. ,     v-::-:\&quot;v&apos;:&apos;v3. Whether the congestion at French ports, due to lack of rolling-stock, can be further relieved, and if so, how.As regards (3), the Conference accepted the assurance of the French Delegates, that everything that could be was being done to relieve the congestion at the French ports, by increasing rolling-stock and labour on the railways, and especially by establishing depots inland from the ports for the detraining of materiel, there by relieving the sheds at the docks.4. The shipbuilding resources of the three countries; what can be done towards building merchant ships and patrol craft, and their types.The statement of the French.officers showing the requirements for materials, steel, and engines, having been handed in and read, the Third Sea Lord promised that every effort would be made to meet them, and that it appeared possible that the Ministry of Munitions might be able to reduce temporarily the:work on shelf steel for the French Armj (in view of the large accumulation in England), so that the steel required by the French Navy can be rolled.As regards thirteen merchant cargo ships, nearing completion, arrangements will be made for the immediate supply of the outstanding material required to complete them, as soon as the details of requirements have been received from the C.T.R.With regard to engines for motor lighters and for tugs, it was pointed out that some of the former required might be ordered at once from Messrs. Huston Procter, of Lincoln, and engines for one or two tugs, from Messrs.: Sissons, of Gloucester. To facilitate supplies of steel material it was agreed that (a.) Qualities demanded should be reduced to two, namely, boiler plates and -..        constructional; and(6.) The nearest British dimensions would be accepted instead of metric.. The: Italian requirements having been handed in and read,;the Third Sea Lord stated that every effort would be made to supply these increased requirements over those which were already being arranged for, but that in the present stringency of raw material, and the great demand on the rolling-mills of the country for the Allied Armies and Navies,; it \va^ impossible to guarantee until the position has again been thoroughly gone into by the Minister of Munitions that the amount can be supplied.5. Questions relating to alterations in the zones in the Mediterranean.-    .   .:;;.: It was agreed :  .&apos;.-;      (1.) That the dividing line between Zones V and VII should be a line joining &apos;   Elaphonisi (S.W. point of Crete) to Cape Spartivento at a position 15 miles from Cape Spartivento ; &apos; &quot;  .;; :,*2;) That the dividing line between Zones V and X should be the meridian of ;     Elaphonisi to the southward; (3.) That the dividing line: between Zones VII and VIII should be a line joining &apos;. &quot;Cape Tripiti in Crete to the south point of Santorin, thence following the -east coast of Santorin to the N.E. point of Sikino, thence following the east coast of Siphano to the N.E. point of Serpho to the south point of Thermia to Cape Colonna;(4.) That the dividing line between Zones VIII and X should remain unaltered, except when it is affected by the slight modification of the; meridian separating Zones V and X.The chart attached shows the new areas.6. Interchange of views as to the best means of protecting shipping in the Medi-terranean against submarines; escorts, patrols, and routes. Representatives should be supplied with lists of places in the Mediterranean near the trade routes, which are protected against submarine attack.
As a result of the discussion the following decisions were arrived at: &apos; In the Western Basin of the Mediterranean it was agreed :-That the coastal route should be utilised as much as possible, and that each country should decide as to whether their vessels should take the direct route from Marseilles to Algiers, that is, by the route arranged by the French Ministry of: Marine. . . *That the question of protection with nets of certain ports should be looked into, and if the British Government can spare any nets they will communicate , with the Ministry of Marine at faris and Borne as to where they would suggest - - these nets being placed. . .In the Eastern Basin of the Mediterranean it. was agreed :-To adopt.the proposed French system of fixed routes, frequently changed, for traffic to and from&quot; Salonica and the 2Egean, and to adopt the proposed English system of dispersion for traffic between Cape Bon and Port Said for British vessels, and Allied vessels, if desired. -That the British undertake to maintain the patrols on-the French routes, and that no patrol vessel will be diverted from these patrols for employment in connection with the dispersed-routes. After a period of trial the working, of the two systems to be compared at a joint conference with j, view to the adoption of a, -&quot; permanent system. .  ;In general it was agreed that the British Admiralty should arrange for a- representa-tive to be appointed on the staff of Rear-Admiral Fatou, and that, if possible, he should be Captain G.B. Powell, formerly on the staff of Admiral Limp us. The further question as to whether Admiral Fatou should be at Malta or at Bona will be investigated by Admiral de Bon,, and a further communication sent in due course.It was agreed that stations for aircraft should be organised at Lampedusa and Marsala (in Sicily), so. that the French aircraft from Bizerta can utilise these places, and consequently increase their radius of action. These sub-bases to be available for the British aircraft from Malta as also the British Station at Malta to be. available to the French&apos; aircraft from Biserta, Generally that British or French aircraft should use any of these stations as may be necessary. &apos;7. Provision of protection that can&apos; be given to the British drifters of the Otranto Barrage.With reference to paragraph 7, the Allied Delegates recognise that the means actually available for the Otranto Barrage are not sufficient for the purpose. But, since it has been suggested that, for the more efficient organisation and the better defence of the drifters, it would be advisable to put this service under the command of a British naval officer, who would be under the orders of the Italian Commander-in-Chief, the Italian and French Delegates concur with this suggestion, and unanimously declare that they will place at the disposal of. the British Commodore all the craft available in those waters which are not employed elsewhere.The Commodore is also empowered to call upon the Allied forces in the vicinity for such assistance, when help is needed, as may be available at the time.The Italian Minister of Marine requests that the hew appointment of the British Commodore should not take place before the 1.5th February next.&apos;t 8. Question whether offensive operations in the Adriatic are possible; and, if so,-their nature. . \ &apos; : 1 &apos;It was agreed that major naval operations in the Adriatic; were not at present possible, but that minor operations should be carried out with vigour.9. The need of paying off British battleships now employed in the Mediterranean, in order to provide crews for new ships.With reference to paragraph 9, the Italian Delegates have pointed out that the only enemy naval force to be confronted in the Mediterranean is the Austrian fleet shut in the Adriatic, and that therefore it is necessary to have ready and concentrated at all times a superior fleet in opposition. ;&apos; &quot;While this purpose was satisfactorily fulfilled by the fleet concentrated in article 2 of the Naval Convention, the situation, as altered by the withdrawal of the &quot;Queen&quot; [300] c
division, would be unfavourably changed, especially if- account is taken of the losses y     sustained thus far by the Italian Navy.&quot; . .Besides, military and political considerations demand that the fleet should not only be ready to fight the Austrian fleet, but also to prevent raids or other operations of any :   sort by naval&apos;detachments on the Italian coast. *For this second condition, naval forces have so far been successfully maintained at Venice, Brindisi, and Valona : and&apos; their continuous service has consequently entailed deterioration arid losses amongst the torpedo and light craft. &apos;   For these/reasons the withdrawal of the British division should; take place only if V       a substantial French naval force were permanently stationed at Corfu.   The British Admiralty are to make every effort to reinforce the First Allied Squadron by a ! convenient number of light craft when available. &quot;&apos;The Italian Delegates declare that, should the Allies not take in consideration all . y  these circumstances, the conditions on which the possibility is founded of continuing the effort to bring&apos; the war to a successful conclusion would be seriously compromised. : : :   With reference to the command of the Allied naval forces in the Adriatic, which it : y       was understood was appertaining to the Italian Admiral, it has now been decided that y    such command would be taken over by the French Gommander-in-Chief in the eventuality of the greater part of the French naval forces in the Mediterranean taking-part iri operations in the Adriatic. &apos;The French Delegates stated that a squadron of battleships would be constantly available at Corfu, and it was therefore decided to withdraw the British battleships.It was also decided to withdraw all British battleships from the Eastern Medi-terranean except the &quot; Lord Nelson &quot;and &quot; Agamemnon,&quot; the others being replaced by two&apos; battleships of the &quot; Patrie &quot; class. &apos;     &apos;:&apos;/&apos;vv10. Anti-submarine patrols off Ushant: Report of Sub-Committee.------ Vice-Admiral:de Bon explained:the French system of patrols, and stated that hehoped to be able to increase the numbers of trawlers and destroyers available.Rear-Admiral Duff explained the British methods, and asked whether, if we were able to supply a mobile force of twelve trawlers to reinforce the patrols off Ushantwhen they were required, they could be based at Brest.y:y; Vice-Admiral de Bon agreed to this proposition, and said it would be better to base -y them at Brest, with I/Abervrach as a subsidiary; base, and that he would supply pilots from Brest.The Chief of Staff suggested that this force should be free to act wherever the submarines were reported to be. &apos;-.-.---,-.;-v--: It was agreed that the officer in command of this force should1 keep complete &apos;;..;--   control of them, and act in conjunction with the naval authorities at Brest. V-\-.:?.--: Vice-Admiral de Bon explained the system they have adopted for all French traffic coming from the South and West to make Belle Isle, where a depot of pilots has been established. In charge of a pilot, the ships then pass close along the coast to Cherbourg, where the pilots are disembarked. He suggested that our ships might also employ this route.       ; &apos; -&apos; &apos;^-&apos;:&apos;^y&apos;:-&apos;y y \:- &quot;11. Conferences in Mediterranean. - -        .Tt was.agreed that more frequent conferences between the French, Italian, and . y . :   British Admirals should take place in the Mediterranean, and Taranto, Corfu, and Argostoli were sugggested as suitable rendezvous for the purpose. -
MINUTES OF CONFERENCE.First Day.-: - THE PRIME MINISTER: Gentlemen, may I first of all, on behalf of the British Government, welcome the representatives of France and Italy to this country to a conference with regard to the naval situation. It is a great pleasure and privilege to .see so many distinguished representatives of those countries, present.I think it is highly essential that we should, meet, and meet at the earliest possible opportunity, to discuss certain matters, for undoubtedly the situation, is grave and is becoming increasingly so.   We have had complete command of the seas for two years and a half, in spite of all the efforts of the German Navy, but there is no doubt that the challenge to the Allies&apos; supremacy is becoming more serious month by month and week by week.   The Germans have discovered what a formidable weapon the submarine is from the point of view of destroying tile shipping of the Allied and neutral countries, and the tonnage which is being sunk month by month is alarmingly great, and I am afraid it is going to be increased.   The Germans, there is no doubt about it, having discovered how formidable this weapon is. have determined to concentrate their energy upon the manufacture of more arid more of these terrible machines, and submarines are being manufactured by them, I think, at the rate of three a week.  That means that in the course of this year we shall have an addition of over 150 submarines to those they have already got; better, more perfect, and therefore more dangerous.   I need hardly point out what that means to the Allies, because I think it has not been sufficiently apprehended by any of us to what extent the: success of the Allies depends on the supremacy at sea being maintained, although the lessons of the past ought to have taught us how essential it is&quot;to&quot;retain the command of the seas, because in the long run it means the success of the Allies in the war.   If wo cannot put transports freely upon the ocean, all our expeditions to the East are cut off, and we shall not be able any longer to menace the foe on his flank, and he will be&apos; able with impunity to concentrate on the fronts wbere he is strongest.   In addition to thai. Turkey would be inarnline, which is a very formidable fact to. contemplate when you come, to consider what a power Turkey can be; but, worse than that, our food supplies will be endangered.   Our supplies of,munitions also would be endangered/ because neither France, Italy, nor Great Britain can manufacture a sufficient quantity of steel, to begin with, without getting supplies from America, and they -cannot even manufacture what they are manufacturing now unless the.sea is free for the conveyance of. raw material from Spain -and elsewhere.   So that the success oY- the Allies depends entirely upon the arrange-ments which can. be made for the protection of the mercantile marine during this year. The challenge is atremendous one.   The Germans, without inflicting a military defeat ; upon us, could win the war by destroying ourmercantile marine, and therefore this Conference I regard as one of the most serious and most important conferences which ,    has been held since the war began.   That is why T rejoice not merely that; we have the benefit of the presence of the great experts of the various navies present, but also repre-sentatives of the Ministries who have a responsible voice in determining the policy to be pursued.   I am not going to enter very fully into the suggestions which have been put forward, because the First Lord of the Admiralty will. place all the considerations which are to be submitted by the British Admiralty to their colleagues of. other countries;, in addition to which, I shall have shortly to leave to attend.a War Cabinet, where we are settling other matters.But I should like to say one or two things generally as to what, in the judgment of the Admiralty, and of the British Government acting on their advice, might be con-sidered amongst other things by this Conference. I have no doubt the representatives of France and Italy will bear in mind the points which the British Admiralty submit for the consideration of the Conference.The first is the question of the arming of merchant, ships. That is the first question we should like the Conference to come to a conclusion upon. The arming of merchant ships, of course, is not a complete defence, but from our experience, and, I think from the experience of our Allies, armed ships are more immune, at any rate, than other ships which are not armed, and wecOuld save a very considerable percentage of , casualties by putting guns upon these ships.
The second point is the provision of craft required to take offensive action against submarines.   We are building all kinds of craft, and I have no doubt the same thing is being done by our Allies, but we are limited by the demands which are made by the mercantile marine with regard to the building of ships, and that, &quot;brings^ me to another consideration, which is, the importance of our going on building ships, not merely ships for the Navy, but ships for the transport of goods and troops.   I do not know what the resources of France and Italy are in this respect, but I am certain it is absolutely essential for the success of the Allies that whatever resources the three countries can command ^should be energetically developed for the purpose first of all of constructing craft for attacking submarines.   We have constructed some kinds of vessels which havebeen very successful in that respect, and they have destroyed a great, many submarines, but we want many more on the trade routes, and we want the assistance of our Allies in building as many of these craft as. we possibly can, and also in building other ships.   At present the rate of loss, in spite of the fact that we kre putting all our shipbuilding yards to the utmost strain, is great, and we shall be down at the end of the year very considerably in mercantile tonnage.   Therefore it is most important that all the shipbuilding energy of the three; countries should at&apos; once be applied to those two problems, because there is one thing I want to urge very much upon the Conference.   I do not say the war is going on beyond this year, but I am. absolutely certain if the Germans know we cannot vcarry it on beyond this year we shall not win this year.   I want to make that quite clear.   If the Germans know that we are ready for another yearl think we shall win this year.   Therefore I want the whole energy of the Allies to bo brought to bear so as to make it clear to the Germans that even if they can- last out till 191H they will not gain anything by it.   I want to urge that upon you: all veryystrongly.:  You must have everything ready even for 191S if you are going to win in 1917. : That is why I want all these possible resources developed without any loss of time.,.&apos; There is.another consideration which I want to urge very much upon the :repre-sentatives of the Allied Navies, and I want specially to call the attention of Ministers here to this point, because it is not altogether Admiralty work, but is a matter which I want them to bring to the attention of their respective Governments. It is. most important that we should reduce all unnecessary imports.   That is a matter which we are applying our minds to in this country.   We are cutting down everything which is unnecessary, in; fact we are cutting down everything which is not absolutely necessary  all articles of luxury, and so On, and we are trying our very best to increase the production or food so that we should not.be so dependent on foreign countries.   We are devoting our minds here to cutting down everything of that kind, and everything which saves tonnage, so that we should concentrate on everything which is essential, such as steel, munitions of war, and metals which we cannot get in our own countries, and which have to be got from abroad, and we are also reducing to a minimum the import of/foodstuffs and confining it strictly td what cannot possibly be produced in this country, and; I. urge upon the representatives of the Allies that they should do likewise.   Now I shall go straight away to discuss these points at the War Cabinet where we have been devoting ourselves very largely to cutting down everything so that we might provide tonnage for things which are more essential.   Therefore I say it is very necessary that there should be a discussion amongst the Allies as to the best way of using their tonnage, and that they should see whether it is not possible by means of very strict economy.to cut down their imports.y: Another question&apos; which was discussed in Rome, as the Minister of Italy remembers, was the question of utilising the; railways as; much as possible,; in order to save the long sea tonnage, and I think a great deal could be done in that way, and that the railways could be very largely used so. as to save long journeys by sea. That .is a very important consideration, because everything which facilitates the supply of tonnage will make it all the more impossible for the Germans to break down our defence, as they are trying to do, hy. destroying so much of our tonnage as to make it impossible for us to go on. . ;    yAnother point is that it is very important that arrangements should be made at the ports for ra.pid discharge and loading of ships, t because, as everyone knows, you increase your tonnage every time you get a ship cleared in half the ordinary time. We are doing&apos;our best to get labour from different.parts of the Empire employed in.France in the discharge of cargo. Of Course, most.of.the difficulties are experienced in the French, ports owing to the tremendous congestion caused by the taking in of material in the north for the huge army which we have there, and therefore; the demand on the French ports is great.  It is the same with the Italian ports, where you want to,be able,
instead of keeping ships in the ports a week and sometimes a fortnight, as sometimes happens, to get them rapidly discharged and reloaded, so as to save time, and by that means to save tonnage. Save tonnage, by every possible means ; save it by cutting down imports ; save it by means of rapid moving about of the ships and losing no time in the ports ; and save it also by a due consideration of the question of wages, and keep up the . tonnage by building. .   - . - -Now I come to another and much more difficult problem, but it is very much better that we should face these problems. In Rome, where we spent three days, we did not spare ourselves the discussion of difficult and delicate topics in the least. We thought them out amongst ourselves, considered all the difficulties, and in the end we settled them. We might have saved time by avoiding the consideration of these things, but we did not, because the representative of such and such a country did&apos;not like it. There was: a certain country which was in a very difficult frame of mind about that, but instead of avoiding these topics, we faced them. We talked very freely, and did not avoid on our side putting our case. It is better that it should be done believe me, it is much ;  better.     - -&apos; - - &apos;. I now come to a very difficult topic, and that is the control of the Mediterranean. I know all the difficulties about, this. There are susceptibilities amongst the various Navies, questions of precedence and priority-all questions which create the greatest difficulty in the world in all naval, and military matters. They had really better be faced. The Mediterranean now-and let us be quite frank about it is not as well -.. managed as it ought to be, It is not the fault of any one of us, but the fault of the three of us ; that is the fact of the matter. It is because we are afraid of a quarrel, and therefore we do not talk about things that we ought to talk about. Let us talk about them. It is veiy much better to settle them. Our interest is common,- and we ought not to; allow comparatively little things to interfere with what, after all, is essential to the life of each country-essential to the life of Italy, essential to the life of France, essential to the life of Great Britain, and essential&apos;to something which is more important than any nation, and that is the future of the whole of the human race, which, I think, is depend ant upon the&apos; success of the Allies in, this great war. Now let us face it, and face it like men, and. dismiss.ail professional feeling and any possible rivalries, and consider what is the best arrangement to be made for the maritime control of the Mediterranean. We are losing ships there;: We cannot afford to lose them. The coal of Italy depends upon it, the future of the free countries of the East depends upon it, and unless something is done to get better co-operation and co-ordination amongst the Allied fleets in the Mediterranean, you will find the Mediterranean a closed sea for the ,AUies. Very well, let us deal with it. There are many ways of dealing with it. As far as the control of shipping is concerned, and the control of the routes,T say quite frankly that I think you had better leave it to the station at Malta. There are two &apos; suggestions to make about the control of the: Mediterranean: either that you should hand over the control of the Mediterranean to the more powerful fleet, or, as far as we are concerned, our own opinion is that the French, and the Italian fleets ought;to be &apos; quite: enough for the Mediterranean; We want not so much our ships at home as we want our crews here.   We want those crews for the purpose of arming merchant .vessels. We have not got the necessary trained crews unless we bring these ships home. Therefore I think-and that is the view of the British Admiralty-that these ships, ought to be brought home, and the Mediterranean left to the two Allied fleets; which are mostly in the Mediterranean and who have Mediterranean seaports. Then comes the question of control.   There are three ways of doing that;   v. - V1. That you.should give the control of the Mediterranean, to the more/powerful fleet, exactly as the control at Salouica of the various armies is given to theFrench.:       2. That you should have spheres of Influence there, so that you should have the Italian fleet in control say of the Adriatic, and the French fleet in control of the Mediterranean. 3. The third suggestion:is that you should have a; Joint Board &quot;sitting somewhere, -.:;.-:;;-, say at Malta, with representatives of the -three fleets controlling the whole: of the fleets in the Mediterranean.I hope you will face that, and see that, whichever it is, it is a real control.   It is no use having a Joint Board there unless the Board has. the power.   If that Board is always to refer back the French questions to somebody; and our representatives refer: :&apos;to somebody, and the Italians refer to somebody, that is not control at all; it is simply adding another authority and adding to the muddle.   I am putting forward that as a../ [300]- :      ;     -d . -.
suggestion, but only as one of the three questions to be faced. I am quite clear that you have to alter the whole system of control in the Mediterranean, and unless that is done so many ships will be sunk as to make it impossible fur us to run vessels into the Mediterranean at all, quite impossible.Now I think I have pretty well covered the ground, and Professor Mantoux will interpret what I have said. I have no doubt if there are any deficiencies in my state-meut they will be made up by the First Lord in the views he puts forward upon the case. Meanwhile I invite all those who are present here to act as if we were really one country, as we are one cause. The failure of one is the failure, of all; the success of one is the success of all. Acting together, I have never had the slightest doubt that we should win; but unless.we show a disposition to pool our resources, and to regard, not merely our aims as common but our resources as common, we shall not achieve the victory. Now I consider that we should face our problems&apos; in the other spirit, so that in the year 1917 you may find the triumph of the Allied cause. . .;    I thank you, gentlemen, for listening to what I have said.THE PRIME MINISTER : I am sorry I shall have to go now to the Cabinet Meeting, but I hope to have the pleasure of meeting you again later on. Sir Edward Carson, the First Lord of the Admiralty, will take the chair.- (Mr. Lloyd George then left the room.).SIR EDWARD CARSON : I would suggest that the most convenient way of doing the business which we have to carry out would be to have first a short general discussion upon the points which the Prime Minister has raised, and the points which are on the Agenda paper. It would be impossible for a Conference of this size to go into the details of the various questions, and. if it meets with the views of the Cou-ference, we would suggest that after there has been a general discussion, we should appoint Sub-Committees.to examine the various questions which have to be considered. I think we would get through the business, better in that way, and when the Sub-Com-mittees have met together, consisting of representatives ;from each of the nations concerned, we could then have a meeting of the Conference to consider the views and the reports: of those Sub-Committees. I think that would probabby, if it meets the views of the Conference, be the most businesslike way of getting through our business. First let us have a short general discussion. I do not know whether the French Minister would like to say anything on the general question.y y: (REAR-ADMIRAL LACAZE addressed the Conference in French. Professor Mantoux translated as follows) :  . - -- The Admiral does not wish to say anything stronger, or. to say it better than Mr. Lloyd George did, but there is one point to which he would wish to refer. When Mr. Lloyd George spoke, of the necessity of close alliance and union between the Allied countries?, he must have remembered the first time he: met Admiral Lacaze at the Paris Conference, and it was the Admiral who insisted on the necessity of working in a common spirit: Close together, just as the Prime Minister said a few minutes ago -very likely Mr. Lloyd George has not forgotten this. The questions before this Conference are very important. The Admiral considers the same questions which Mr. Lloyd George mentioned as being the most important- are those he.would put first. - Perhaps he does not see them under such dark light as the Prime Minister did. When Mr. Lloyd George said that we must not let our enemies think that we are downhearted, and that we do not consider we can go further, than the end of this year, he (Admiral Lacaze) would say more than that that we must not by any means think or feel that We cannot go beyond this year. When we think of our tonnage being destroyed by the enemy this is extremely inconvenient to us, but, after nil, it is a negative result to the enemy, because it will not feed the enemy country, and we know how much they suffer, and how grave the situation is from that point of view. Now, if from the negative point of view we come.-to the positive point of view, he would like to add something to what has been said just.now. It is indispensable for us to work and act in a spirit of offensive, not^only on land, but also at sea. . We have been thinking that what we -should be; chiefly occupied with is measures to defend ourselves against the enemy&apos;s marine campaign. We ought to eonsider what sort of offensive, or, rather, offensives, we might ourselves undertake. Those offensives will not perhaps be very big, they may in themselves be considered small, but their, combined effect will be.considerable, and we must by all means show the enemy that we are not down-hearted, and that we can dare and act.   But just because we want to act,.it is not time, now to go on discoursing
upon these things, but the best thing to do is to come to business at once, and the procedure suggested by the First Lord seems to Admiral Lacaze the proper one. Sub-Committees might be appointed to consider the matters in detail and then report.to the Conference, and the Conference would take record of it.VICE-ADMIRAL CORSI expressed his concurrence; in. the proposed procedure : adding that care should be taken that; experts, should attend the committees to deal with special subjects, e.g., transport.    -SIR EDWARD CARSON: We thought that questions Nos. 1 and 3 one Sub-Committee might consider, together with question No..2 on the subject; of,coal. We are prepared to consider those first three questions, and our representatives on the Sub-Committee will he the Fourth Sea Lord, who understands this case, Sir Joseph Maclay (the Shipping Controller), the Director of Transports, and the Director of- the Trade Department, because they have all the materials. Perhaps the French Minister will say who he would like on his side to be members of the Committee to consider those questions.; . -:Vv&apos;-&apos;   &apos;REAR-ADMIRAL LACAZE: M.Joly, Minister of Transport.SIR EDWARD CARSON : Perhaps the best way would be for you to write down the names of your.representatives.   :CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY : One or two. - assistants might be present. Is it necessary to put down their names ?Slit EDWARD CARSON : No, they can attend. We also propose to add question No. 4 to this. Committee; that is the question of our ship-building, which is really all part of the same question. If the gentlemeu appointed on that Sub-Committee will now reHre to the next room they might commence business.(The Committee retired to consider the questions submitted to them.)-. SIR EDWARD C1PSON: The next Committee we have to form is one to deal with, the zones in the Mediterranean in the way of protecting, the Mediterranean against submarines, \ and the question of offensive operations in the Adriatic. You will find that dealt with in questions Nos. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12. I understand that this Committee will best be constituted of those . representatives who now: remain in the Conference. The First Sea Lord, Admiral Jellicoe, thinks you-will probably agree that the first question to discuss on these matters relating to the Mediterranean is No. 9, as a decision come to upon that may affect the others. .; REAR-ADMIRAL LACAZE : Yes, we quite agree to that.ADMIRAL JELLICOE: The suggestion that: we should bring home our battle-ships is rendered advisable, as: was stated by the Prime Minister, owing to the fact that without the crews-officers and men-in those battleships we shall not be able - to man the ships we are building in such ; large numbers, principally destroyers and; light cruisers. . Men ; are also required to man the guns - in the-defensively-armed : merchant ships. We are now in process of arming our merchant ships, at the rate of about.200 a month, and that process will continue until all the ships are armed by, it is hoped, the autumn. We require to provide at least two trained men for every merchant ship which is armed, so that we require trained men at the rate of about 400 a month for those ships. Our greatest difficulty is in the provision of officers to man the new destroyers which are so necessary to take offensive action against submarines. The difficulty which presumably will arise if we bring home our battleships will be the strength of the Adriatic force -the Italian fleet. I would like to suggest that that deficiency might be made up by close co-operation between.. the French and Italian Navies. The relative strength of the French and Italian Navies combined, so far: as battleships are concerned, is something like, 1 think, three to one against the Austrians, and it therefore seems a most wasteful expenditure of officersand men who are very urgently needed elsewhere for us to keep out in the Mediterranean nine battleships which I think we have there at the moment, locking up some 9,000 officers and men. It is not suggested that we should withdraw any other class of vessel, because I know how necessary the light cruisers and destroyers are to the Allied,cause, but we do press very strongly for the withdrawal, if mot of the whole of our battleships, of all except one, that is, the flagship. It would, of course, necessitate,.in addition to some possible strengthening of the Italian fleet, some ships being sent to assist in blocking
the exit of the u Goeben,&quot; if she attempts to break out. If we left our flagship there one ship, of course, would be insufficient, and, moreover, she might be refitting. At present we keep four battleships in the Eastern Mediterranean. I should imagine that three would be ample to prevent the &quot;Goeben &quot; escaping. . It is quite obvious that the &quot; Goeben &quot; cannot have now the speed which she had in the beginning of the war, and if she has not been in dock it is possible her bottom may have been cleaned by the use of cofferdams in some measure, but she is known to have been badly injured, and I think it is safe to assume that her speed would not.much exceed that of some of the faster battleships; she also has to pass through British minefields, which I hope we may be able to.strengthen. I suggest that the withdrawal of our battleships would not in any way affect the command of the: Mediterranean so far as -surface vessels are concerned, so long, of course, as there is close co-operation between the two Navies which are supreme in the Mediterranean.. : . REAR-ADMIRAL LAC A ZE : I have no objection to the proposals of the First Sea Lord, which largely depend on the view taken about the objective of a British fleet in the Mediterranean. It is understood that the task of the British fleet is to keep the Dardanelles, to bombard different places on the coast, and to help the British forces at Salonica. Undoubtedly we cannot have sufficient force in the Salonica area to do what is necessary,: though1 the French problem there is very-difficult, because they have the same or even greater difficulty with regard to men that there is in this country. It is found difficult to find not only officers but even men for trawlers, which are not less numerous than yours. We have considered the topic of disarming two old battleships which we have at Salonica because we want the men. As to the Dardanelles, probably it is possible to do everything there &apos;.by having more -destroyers and; submarines so as. to&apos;jmake: it impossible for the (i Goeben &quot; to escape. If we maintain, or rather, reinforce, the small craft In the Mediterranean, there is no -serious objection to the removal of: tbe British battleships, but two battleships of the Third Squadron would be in the Salonica area.VICE-ADMIRAL CORSI: Referring to the great difficulty about manning ships which is experienced in Italy, without insisting may I ask whether you should not consider, when building more destroyers, how you will be able to man them. At Salonica it would not be difficult to face the situation created by the removal of the British battleships; With regard to the Adriatic I do not know whether we should not again look at the dispositions we take for the defence of that sea. The Austrian .. fleet being there we have to face a superior force, and I should like to ask whether the Admiral spoke of taking all: the battleships from the. Mediterranean, which . :Admiral Lacaze confirms,::because then the necessaiy precautions would, have to: be taken in order to see that we do not lose our: superiority over: the Austrian fleet in the Adriatic, and our safety there.REAR-ADM IRA L LACAZE : I agree with the suggestion that the safety there should be secured by close co-operation between the Italian and French fleets.: At present, there is already a French Squadron at Corfu, and probably the Admiral in command of the Western Mediterranean ports will have the whole or. nearly the whole of his. fleet soon, and the Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean will he per-manently in the Corfu area. What cannot be considered is the division of that French naval force into two parts; it must remain one force, because its strength relies upon the fact that it is,one fleet.When it is assembled at Corfu, it will have its maximum efficiency, and without leaving that place it can very well collaborate with the Italian fleet in the Mediterranean, which is what was my suggestion...ADMIRAL JELLICOE: It would seem that with the French fleet at Corfu the Adriatic is perfectly secure.ADMIRAL CORSI: Not the whole French fleet-a squadron only.-y ADMIRAL JELLICOE: Admiral; Lacaze says the whole French fleet.   .. y&apos;      ADMIRAL CORSI : Sometimes, not always.ADMIRAL LACAZE said that there was already a French squadron at Corfu and. one at Argostolk. What he was going to. ask was that an Italian squadron might be sent to Argostoli, so. that the two fleets, by. exercising together, might get used to acting in conceit, and, so to say, speaking the same naval language, which would enable them to support each other in case of need. &apos;
ADMIRAL CORSI replied that this would gladly be &apos; done.   The squadron recently brought back to Taranto could be, sent to Argostoli.   - (The position was ; explained on the chart.) :-.Ayy--ADMIRAL JELLICOE : It does seem wrong as.- a policy to keep such an over-whelming force of battleships in the Mediterranean. V When one considers the strength of those two great fleets, the&apos; French and the Italian, it seems very wrong to strain the Allied resources in that way. The vessels which we wish, to man are for doing work which benefits the whole of the Allies. It does seem wrong that we are unable to bring : those battleships home when one looks at the enormous list of ships, and the enormous preponderance which the Allies have in the Mediterranean. -v - SIR EDWARD CARSON : Is not the first question which we have to decide this : Supposing these ,ships come away,; have you still got the overwhelming preponderance ?    &quot;ADMIRAL JELLICOE: Yes, unquestionably. .SIR EDWARD CARSON : If so, are not the ships being wasted ? Does it not really come to that ? ,ADMIRAL JELLICOE : Twelve Dreadnoughts remain to four.   Of older ships there is also a great preponderance, and it does seem, I would almost say, laughable to keep those old ships of ours out in the Mediterranean when the officers and men&quot; are .: wanted so acutely. . - , ,VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON : If there is any co-operation in the Adriatic, I think we alone have sufficient to face the Austrians; but then the question is, what operations -can happen in the Adriatic ? -   -ADMIRAL JELLICOE: Nothiiig.VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON: Then the question is solved. .  ADMIRAL JELLICOE :. I cannot see what can happen in the Adriatic. ADMIRAL CORSI: I think nothing can happen. -ADMIRAL JELLICOE: Nothing can be done in the Adriatic until there are more destroyers, because I think everybody will agree that without a greater number of destroyers it is not safe to send a battle fleet into the Adriatic.VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON : If you think there is going to be no alteration in that district, I think the question is quite solved, because I think, in a.greement with my Minister, that if the Austrian Fleet came out from the Adriatic it would be beaten.; ADMIRAL JELLICOE : I. am sure there would be nothing left of it,VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON: Surely the thing is to beat those ships with the least damage, and for this purpose it is necessary to be quite close to the Italian Fleet, . and to be ready to act with that fleet, and it is necessary we should be: quite in touch one ;   with the other.   I think the general idea of the Conference is. that there is;no operation ..  possible in the Adriatic. .  &apos; &apos;ADMIRAL CORSI: No actual operation. &apos;SIR EDWARD CARSON : Then what it would come to is that, the Conference being of opinion that no offensive operations in the Adriatic are possible, the necessity of keeping the British battleships there does not arise, andahey&apos; would more Usefully serve the cause of the Allies by allowing us to take them away, and use. the officers and men elsewhere. That question.also, as. I understand, involves co-operation between the French and the Italian Fleets, because they will want to be in still chaser co-operation in order to make the two fleets fully available in concert for any attempts the Austriaus might make. That would bring us to the next question, which is with regard to closer co-operation, and how that can best be carried on.:   .&apos;    ADMIRAL CORSI: I think the co-operation between us: is.already the greatest possible, and I feel quite sure it will always b- the greatest possible, but nevertheless if, ...in spite of this co-operation, there is any &apos;bvi ion-of opinion, 1 he position might be changed.   In any case, the withdrawal of the Kritishbattleships would change the -situation. . .
REAR-ADMIRAL LACAZE: I would suggest that there should be an exchange of ships. Admiral Jellicoe reminded us that; these are old battleships, ^ capable of rendering little real assistance. They had much better go if at the same time we can strengthen the Otranto Barrage. There and there alone can we stop the enemy&apos;s sub-marines. The Austrian Fleet does not disturb me: the &quot;really necessary thing, is to strengthen the Barrage at the entry to the Adriatic. -y : ADMIRAL JELLICOE; I would like to mention that we are pressing the Japanese very strongly to send a flotilla of destroyers to the Mediterranean, and we hoj e to succeed. We are offering to pay for the. coal, to pay for the officers and the men, and to pay for anything if they will send us some destroyers. They are asking for something first, money and something else.   I hope, however, to succeed.VICE ADMIRAL DE BON : We tried to buy the flotilla, but they would not sell.ADMIRAL JELLICOE: I hope that by giving them both coal and money we may persuade them to send a flotilla.ADMIRAL LACAZE: I think there is some difficulty about public opinion in Japan, which might be alarmed if these boats were sent so far away from home. Japan is building us a dozen destroyers. Delivery was promised for May, but it is already put&apos;off till August.ADMIRAL CORSI:. Frankly, and we must speak frankly, I do not think that her Convention with us would allow England to withdraw the battleships without promising some compensation.ADMIRAL DE BON : But one must admit that the conditions have changed since the beginning of the war. Tiie presence of the English battleships had an object which no longer exists, for the hypothesis of a big general engagement is now most improbable.ADMIRAL CORSI: Yes. The menace of a big offensive on the part of the enemy fleets in the Mediterranean has disappeared. The danger we now have to face is submarines   Therefore we need new means for old to. meet the new situation.CAPTAIN KELLY: Do you not think that you have all the forces you need in the Mediterranean with two fleets, either one of which is superior to the Austrian?ADMIRAL JELLICOE : What damage would the Austrian fleet do if they came -  to there 9 &apos;ADMIRAL CORSI: Break the line of communications and bombard the batteries and forts.ADMIRAL JELLICOE : But you have submarines. ADMIRAL CORSI: We have.ADMIRAL JELLICOE : I should have thought it better to have submarines to defend an advanced place like that. . - &apos;ADMIRAL CORSI: I think 1 will retire the battleships to join the others.ADMIRAL JELLICOE: Do you think it necessary to keep battleships there? With the French fleet at Corfu is not the Adriatic perfectly secure ?ADMIRAL CORSI: If a squadron conies out we could stop it. At the end of the Adriatic our position is very good.   -ADMIRAL JISLLICOE: We are endeavouring to send seaplanes from here.SIR EDWARD CARSON: The whole questi on comes back to whether we can afford to have these ships lost. The discussion seems to me to show that you are perfectly safe without bur battleships, and unless we can bring them home it will mean that we cannot man these new torpedo-destroyers, which will be much more useful than these battleships,1 as they come in from time to time. Everybody must take a certain amount of risk.: ADMIRAL CORSI: My point is that we ought to have compensation in the shape of light craft. Admiral Lacaze said the same thing when he spoke of the Otranto Barrage.
.y ; CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY : The:question is, shall we get; anything in the Mediterranean for the advantage you get by being able to man those destroyers ?SIR EDWARD CARSON : I do not think that is quite the question, but if you have sufficient superiority between yon and the French fleet to be equal to: the Austrian fleet, why should those ships of ours be kept wasted there ? They are really being wasted at a time when every man is wanted.;:CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY: That is the idea of our Minister. We have now those four ships, and there may be a waste of men on them; but as we are short in battleships, destroyers, drifters, and trawlers, and we are going; to give up these warships,.we should get some compensation in minor craft, v.......ADMIRAL JELLICOE: I would mention that we have sent a monitor, submarines, and destroyers.CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY : We have never seen the destroyers.ADMIRAL JELLICOE : They are coming. We have on the stocks a series none of which were in the Convention. We have done our best to supply everything we could to the Italians.   I only say that because Admiral Corsi mentioned the Convention.CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY: We are not asking much, but you are improving your destroyers.ADMIRAL JELLICOE: The only point we are endeavouring to clear up is whether the battleships are necessary. If they are not necessary, surely they should -come away, whether or not we can send anything else you consider necessary; but we will do it if we can, of course, if you say what you consider necessary in destroyers or, perhaps, submarines.CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY : We should like more destroyers.ADMKtAL JELLICOE : We have not got them now to send. We have not anything approaching enough for our needs at present.ADMIRAL CORSI: Supposing you gave me some old destroyers.ADMIRAL JELLICOE : We have no old destroyers. Would the &quot; River &quot; class be of use to you ? We have at this time a large number of transports which&quot; cannot sail with troops, or which cannot come home with troops, because we have no destroyers to escort them.       &apos;ADMIRAL CORSI : You have some difficulty there ?ADMIRAL JELLICOE: Great difficulty.SIR EDWARD CARSON : We are getting destroyers in at the rate of about six a month, and we want these crews from the battleships to put on them : that is -how it operates.   Every day they are wanting destroyers allround the place.ADMIRAL JELLICOE: If the Austrians come out of the Adriatic there is the whole French fleet against them. Admiral de Bon is quite clear that the situation is secure.VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON : The situation is quite secure. It would be better to use the actual means on this side if it were possible.ADMIRAL.JELLICOE : It does not seem logical to replace battleships by destroyers. If the battleships are necessary they should be there ; if they are not necessary, what is the use of them there ? They cannot be replaced by destroyers. If we had the destroyers we would certainly send them, but I cannot call it logical to say you can replace battleships by destroyers.   They.are totally different.CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY: You were going to give us certain help there, but now you want to withdraw those ships.SIR EDWARD CARSON: Thev are not giving you any help at present.CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY : It is a potential help., &apos;SIR EDWARD CARSON \ It is really having so many ships lying idle and doing nothing.ADMIRAL CORSI: We lost five of our ships at the beginning.
V SIR EDWARD CARSON: If you tell me the ships are indispensable, that is-another question.ADMIRAL JELLICOE : It seems to be recognised that the ships are not required, because Admiral Corsi is ready to give them up if we give something else, but the something else is not battleships.  .\ CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY : You said you were quite ready to examine whether you could give us something else. ^ . -ADMIRAL JELLICOE : I know we cannot give you any destroyers now: that is perfectly certain. . -&apos;/   ..ADMIRAL CORSI: And no big torpedo-boats ?   .CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY: Those old No. 1 boats--what, you call &quot; coast boats &quot;-are not much use for you, but would be quite useful for us,ADMIRAL JELLICOE: For what purpose do you require them ?CAPTAIN DI V ILL ARE Y : For patrol.ADMIRAL JELLICOE : Against submarines or against what ? . . CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY : Against submarines.ADMIRAL JELLICOE : They have not sufficient gun power against submarines ; their guns are quite insufficient.SIR EDWARD CARSON : We would send them out to fight submarines ourselves if they were good enough.ADMIRAL CORSI: I have two great difficulties: one is the submarines; another one is in escorting troops which leave for Salonica or for any other part.CAPTAIN KELLY : How many craft have you on the Otranto Barrage ?ADMIRAL CORSI: Twenty-one, counting the trawlers.SIR EDWARD CARSON : I am&apos;afraid those torpedo-boats would not be fit for work across there, because they have only one small 12-pr. gun with no range, and their speed is low, only 20 knots. I think we have arrived, have we not, at the conclusion that it is not necessary to keep those battleships there. Can we record that conclusion ? Then we will see what steps,, if any, we can adopt to give you further assistance.(Admiral Corsi and Rear-Admiral Lacaze signified their assent.)SIR EDWARD CARSON : I think, probably, if the Confei ence agrees, the next thing to consider will he the broad question of the general control of the Mediterranean. Then will arise the question as to whether the zones should be altered, and other subsidiaiy matters. The broad question of whether the Mediterranean is&apos; being controlled in the most advantageous way, and with the greatest cohesion amongst the Allies, is a big question. If we once agree about that, the details of the management of the Mediterranean might afterwards be considered by a smaller Committee. I do not know whether it is generally thought- I arn not a judge of these things-that the present arrangement as to zones is a good one, or is sufficient, and that there is sufficient cohesion amongst the Allies in carrying out the arrangement, about zones. I know my Naval Advisers haye generally thought it was entirely insufficient, and that there ought to be some attempt to place the control either under a small Board which would sit somewhere convenient out there, and on which all the Allies would be represented, or under one Admiral.   I do not know whether these are feasible proposals.ADMIRAL JELLICO \i: We might deal first with the question of the: command of the fleets in case of the Austrian.fleet coming out, because: that is a question which has been raised by the Italians. I have a paper, here which came.from the Minister of Marine. I asked Sir Henry Jackson if he would draw up&apos; a. paper about the Mediter-ranean question, and he mentions in it the question of the command. I do not know whether that question of the command has been satisfactorily settled. I do not mean the command in regard to the different zones, but in regard to the question of a fleet action. As I understand it,, our Admiral comes under the French Commander-in-Chief.
VICE-ADMIRAL SIR H. OLIVER: That is in big operations.ADMIRAL JELLICOE : Everything conies Under the! French CommandeMn-; Chief outside the Adriatic.ADMIRAL LACAZE: It seems to me, as Minister of Marine, that the question of control has been settled; and that it. is unnecessary to change the solution-. It is agreed that&quot;in the Mediterranean outside the Adriatic the supreme command belongs to the French Admiral, whilst in the Adriatic the command is Italian. If the French, fleet sends squadrons into the Adriatic to help the Italian fleet in an action, then, as a, matter of course, the ships sent there will be under the supreme command of the Italian Admiral If we suppose an action in which the whole -French fleet would take part,: then it is considered that the command should belong, in that hypothesis, to the French Admiral, because this would then be an action in which tho whole Mediterranean position would be involved, and without question the action would be fought outside the. Adriatic. As regards the organisation of patrols, this is a different question altogether, not closely connected with the first question, and should be discussed quite apart. ;yyy&apos;yy ;: :-:&apos;X:-\[:&apos;.&apos;.: &apos;   .SIR EDWARD CARSON : Is it considered a; satisfactory arrangement that the events themselves should determine who is to be in: complete control ? Will not there be always the question whether the whole fleet is being engaged ? .&apos;;ADMIRAL JELLICOE : I do not think there is any&apos; possibility of the whole fleet being engaged inside the Adriatic. - -SIR ED WARD CARSON : All I mean is that to an outsider it does not look to be a very satisfactory arrangement that you have to makeup your mind under particular exigencies ;as to,who is. hi supreme command. Whether that is feasible only Naval Commanders can tell,   &apos;:;&quot; &quot;v-:yV:- &apos; ..&apos;&apos;.&apos;.;&quot;.&apos; ADMIRAL JELLICOE : I do not know what Admiral Corsi&apos;s view may be in case there is a fleet action in which all the lleet, or the1 majority of the fleet, is engaged&apos; with the French Commander-in-Chief and all his powerful squadron--whether under those conditions it is agreeable.; that the. French Commander-in-Chief should take command.VICE-ADMIRAL CORSI: If part of the French fleet comes into the Adriatic we take command, but if the French Oommander-iu-Ohief and the greatest part of the squadron comes into the Adriatic, the French:Commander is in Command. : .SIR EDWARD CARSON : Then there is the question of the zones.. ADMIRAL.JELLICOE: I think we should refer that to the Sub-Committee-&apos; question No. 8: *y VICE-ADMIRAL: CORSI: I thought we said.not that question.:ADMIRAL JELLICOE : We said not as to battle fleets, but now this is a question of minor operations.: Question No. 8 - is whether, apart from operations of battle-ships in the Adriatic, any minor offensive operations; are possible. Admiral Lacaze . mentioned to me at dejeuner to-day that perhaps a lit retaliation for the German methods; of attack by submarines upon merchant-ships might be.a corresponding; attack upon. Austrian shipping going,up and down the east coast of the Adriatic by submarines, and. possibly we could lay submarine mines there. I do not know; what &quot;Admiral Corsi says about that.  .t^y;&apos;:y.y:; &apos;yy ADMIRAL LACAZE : What I said was this : Actual.conditions appear to make big. offensive operations in the Adriatic impossible, but we can harass the enemy by :&apos; increasing the frequency: andi intensity of our aerial attacks on the Austrian naval bases, works,: and depots near the coast.   And since the Germans&apos; have adopted^ the.;policy of sinking; merchant-ships at: sight, ; webcam prevent; vessels sailing along the Austrian coast by making the same use of our submarines. : Finally-and this is the -most important question-we must do our.best to strengthen and improve the Otranto Barrage;. - -.&quot; &apos; - --- y   . - y.&quot;   ADMIRAL CORSI : We often send aeroplanes: over: Trieste,; Pola, and Fiume. We also lay mines-, near the Coast.    The Austrian coasting, trade isnt of muck importance.   We entirely agree that the minor offensive should be developed in every -. possible: way. ;7 - /.--:: y-.;&apos;&apos;. &apos; yy     &apos; &apos; y&quot;  [300] F
VICE-ADMIRAL SIR H. OLIVER: That is in big operations.ADMIRAL JELLICOE : Everything comes under the French Commander^ti-Chief outside the Adriatic.ADMIRAL LACAZE: It seems to me, as Minister of Marine, that the question of control has been settled; and that it is unnecessary to change the solution. It is agreed that in the Mediterranean outside the Adriatic the supreme command belongs to the French Admiral, whilst in the Adriatic the command is Italian. If the French fleet sends squadrons into the Adriatic to help the Italian fleet in an action, then, as a matter of course, the ships sent there will be under the supreme command of the Italian Admiral. If we suppose an action in which the whole French fleet would take part, then it is considered that the command should belong, in that hypothesis, to the French Admiral, because this would then be an action in which the whole Mediterranean position would be involved, and without question the action would be fought outside the. Adriatic. As regards the organisation of patrols, this is a, different question altogether, not closely connected with the first question, and should be discussed quite apart. -   .SIR EDWARD CARSON: Is it considered a satisfactory arrangement that the events themselves should determine who is to be in complete control ? Will not there be always the question whether the whole fleet is being engaged ?ADMIRAL JELLICOE : I do not think there is any possibility of the whole fleet being engaged inside the Adriatic.SIR EDWARD: CARSON : All I mean is that to an outsider it does not look to be a very satisfactory arrangement that you have to make up your mind under particular exigencies as to.who is in supreme command. Whether that is feasible only Naval Commanders can tell.ADMIRAL JELLICOE : I do not know what Admiral Corses view may be in case there, is a fleet action in which all the fleet, or the majority of the fleet, is engaged with the French Commander-in-Chief and all his powerful squadron-whether under those conditions it is agreeable that the. French Commander-in-Chief should take command.VICE-ADMIRAL CORSI: If part of the French fleet comes into the Adriatic we take command, but if the French Commander-in-Chief and the greatest part of the squadron comes into the Adriatic, the French Commander is in command.   .SIR EDWARD CARSON : Then there is the question of the zones.ADMIRAL JELLICOE : I think we should refer that to the Sub-Committee-question No. 8;VICE-ADMIRAL CORSI: I thought we said not that question.ADMIRAL JELLICOE : We said not as to battle fleets, but now this is a question of minor operations. Question No. 8 is whether, apart from operations of battle-ships in the Adriatic, any minor offensive operations are possible. Admiral Lacaze mentioned to me at dejeuner to-day that perhaps a fit retaliation for the German methods&apos;;of attack by submarines upon merchant-ships might be a corresponding attack upon Austrian shipping going up and down the east coast of the Adriatic by submarines, and-possibly we could Jay submarine mines there. I do not know what Admiral Corsi says about that.ADMIRAL LACAZE : What I said Was this : Actual conditions-appear-&apos;to make big offensive operations in the Adriatic impossible, but we can harass the enemy by increasing the: frequency and; intensity: of our aerial attacks on the Austrian naval bases, works, and dep6ts near the coast. And since the Germans have adopted- the policy of sinking merchant-ships at sight, we can- prevent vessels sailing along the Austrian coast by making the same use of. our submarines. Finally-and this is the most important question-we must do our best to strengthen and improve the Otranto Barrage.&apos; ADMIRAL CORSI: We often send aeroplanes over Trieste, Pola, and Fiume. We also lay mines-near the coast. The Austrian coasting trade isn&apos;t of much importance. We entirely agree that the minor offensive should be developed in every-possible way.[300] . p
ADMIRAL MARZOLO: We must, however, in each case consider whether the risks are proportionate to the results.   The Austrian coasting trade is a small affair.ADMIRAL LACAZE : It would be worth while stopping it altogether.ADMIRAL CORSI: Tn the Adriatic,,a general actionbeing; impossible, we have to consider a detailed offensive,...; That explains the. role pi pur divisions at Brindisi and Vallona. They arc not there in anticipation of a big naval action, but to deal with emergencies, and above all to stop enemy vessels which try to force the blockade.ADMIRAL LACAZE: Can nothing be done against the shipping which protects itself behind the Dalmatian. Islands ?ADMIRAL CORSI: I grant that there you have shipping of considerable import-ance, but it cannot be got at except by air.ADMIRAL LACAZE: We might go further into the possibility of sending submarines there. What is wanted is to increase the coups such as you attempted on Sebenico and to find the enemy&apos;s weak point.ADMIRAL JELLICOE : You had a torpedo raid on Pola?CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY : Yes, and we stayed l  hours.VICE-ADMIRAL CORSI: The torpedoes stopped on the.nets. The action was a very nice one, but without completion,ADMIRAL JELLICOE : What do you use our monitor for ?VICE-ADMIRAL CORSI : For the batteries and forts.ADMIRAL JELLICOE: Is there a possibility of a military expedition being landed here fVICE-ADMIRAL CORSI : Not at present.ADMIRAL JELLICOE : The first necessity will be to mine the Austrian fleet in and to lay mines outside Pola.VICE-ADMIRAL CORSI : They do not come out.SIR EDWARD CARSON: I suppose there is nothing more to be said on the subject of these minor operations ?VICE-ADMIRAL CORSI : We must go on as we are at present; that is the only thing we can do, I think.ADMIRAL JELLICOE : We are anxious to keep these three submarines you have fully employed. .VICE ADMIRAL CORSI: We employ the submarines, but we do not find results -we cannot find the targets. -&apos;CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY: There are not so many, as you have in the North Sea. :;-yy\ .-y;yjy&apos;yy[y&apos;yy:::yy.fy-:&apos;   -&apos;..     0AAy/b:y-.y&apos;;y.:T.y.REAR-ADMIRAL MARZOLO: We amout there every day, but we do not find any targets.     .SIR EDWARD CARSON : May T suggest that questions Nos. 5, 6, and 7 are matters of detail and ought to go to a Sub-Committee ?ADMIRAL JELLICOE: Yes.SIR EDWARD CARSON : Admiral Jellicoe has, I understand, made a suggestion with regard to zones.VICE-ADMIRAL CORSI: What is this question about the zones ?ADMIRAL JELLICOE.: It is the question of patrols. I think there is no alteration suggested as regards the. Italian zones, but only as between the French and ourselves. The proposal made is in order to avoid the changing of zones at dangerous points. This chart shows the present zones and the crossing-points, iwhere there. is great danger. It is there, where, there is a change of zones from British to.French, and it seems to me it would he much safer if the zones through which our transports and other transports pass remained in.one control right through. :y\V    ;:
Therefore my suggestion is that we should add to the. British area that portion included between those two.lines, so that there is no change of control or of zone while passing through this channel..&apos;;-(The-matter was discussed in reference to the chart, by Rear-Admiral Lacaze, the position being explained by Captain Grant. y Rear-Admiral Lacaze and Vice--   Admiral de Bon explained their views.) -y.:ADMIRAL .JELLIOOE : Captain Grant will be able to discuss this matter with the French representatives. -^7yyy-;yy y&apos;X7ri:&apos;&apos;-:&apos;:-&apos;&apos;;7&apos;:.(Rear-Admiral Fatouand Captain Grant retired to discuss the matter in detail.)CAPTAIN KELLY: Admiral Lacaze /points out that all their patrols are usedfor convoys.ADMIRAL JELLICOE : We are j ust proposing a different arrangement.ADMIRAL LACAZE : Our experts who have gone into this question are in favour pf establishing protected routes. 7 Each of these routes will be patrolled by trawlers, and protected by fast units capable of offensive action against submarines. I think this system is better than dispersion,.which makes control almost impossible, for it means patrolling everywhere, and we have not enough vessels to do that, even in the Channel. The number of boats which sail daily in the Mediterranean is about 500. That makes the proposed organisation of convoys out of the question. Ships sailing in groups of fifteen in two lines would be exposed to losses much greater than the present losses, for the submarines could always let the escort go by. and attack in the rear. If it were a question of defending the vessels against surface cruisers the problem would be quite different. &apos;: -ADMIRAL FATOU : Since escort? are necessary we s*hall ask that there.should be day escorts only. Night escorts are useless, and-we have not enough craft to manage them. :ADMIRAL JELLICOE : I think the main difference between our two proposals is this : the French propose to keep to a fixed route and patrol that route, and con-stantly to change that route, keeping the trawlers spaced along it. The objection that we see to the present system is that in the first place a single trawler is not sufficiently powerful to engage a submarine. The submarine will sink the trawler, and that has occurred in many cases- in the North Sea, where our trawlers have been sunk by submarines, because the trawlers&apos; guns are 12-pounders, or even possibly 6-pounders, but the submarine carried a 4-inch gun. Our proposal, on the other hand, is to disperse the trade, not to convoy any ships except troopships, and to keep the trawlers in pairs or in threes in different, portions of. the zone, aud to move them to the area in which a submarine is working as soon as news is received of the submarine in any particular .area, but our thought is that if we have the ships all following different routes the submarine has constantly to move, about: to find the ships. On one of the fixed routes the submarine finds, the route and remains on the route, and waits for the ships to come, in order to sink them, until that route is changed. Our suggestion is that it will -save more ships if we move the ships on many. different routes1 without patrolling any particular route; This chart indicates the proposed system of numerous routes from the East and West Mediterranean--each different colour is a separate route.;?: 7y y yADMIRAL LACAZE : The number of routes increases the length of voyage.   As regards the -inadequacy of trawlers against submarines, Admiral Fatou will say that . successful patrolling has.been done by trawlers working in pairs.ADMIRAL FATOU: If there is a fixed route the submarine will know it, and. take up a position on the route. But we shall also know where to look for her. We can wait for her and destroy her. Of course, as soon as the submarine appears the route-will be changed for another already arranged, and the patrol boats will divert shipping by a signal, and. stay on the;.route, to deal with the submarine. A certain number of routes will be indicated for a given period, changing at irregular intervals. They will only be used by slow craft. Troop-transports and particularly important -vessels will use another system to enable the routes to be changed rapidly&apos; in an emergency. Numbers will be marked on the chart, and letters which can be signalled to ships under way when there is any danger.
ADMIRAL JELLICOE: This discussion at present is:on.the East Mediterranean only. Is it suggested that a chart should be issued to all merchant ships, because, if so. after the first ship is captured the Germans would know every point.ADMIRAL FATOU : The numbers and letters can be often.changed..ADMIRAL JELLICOE: Our experience is that the envelope: is lost immediately it is issued, and that it is quite unsafe We never now give merchant ships anything in writing. We allow them to take .no notes except..such, as they are allowed to put between the leaves of a book, because notes are found at once ; they are so careless..; . CAPTAIN KELLY: Admiral Fatou says that he does not approve of escorting troopships at night, but prefers to come; back and fetch another. To escort them at night he considers waste of time. ,v&apos;v ;;;::;v&apos;:.:-.    &apos;ADMIRAL JELLICOE :; First we want to settle the question of routes.; ;v- REAR-ADMIRAL FATOU:: It is no use convoying transports at night, but the convoy should he sent back..ADMIRAL JELLICOE: The question is whether the system to be adopted is to be a dispersion or fixed.routes constantly: altered. The system of fixed: routes has much in its favour, but I think it is. quite certain that a code of instructions issued by wireless in any form such as.has been suggested would be immediately compromised-in a week: according to. our experience. -.:. CAPTAIN KELLY : The convoys can give.no assistance to ships sunk.ADMIRAL JELLICOE : It is better to save the ships from being sunk altogether than to save the crews afterwards.        -ADMIRAL FAT.OU: Dispersion vis&apos;, perhaps the best method in the Atlantic where; you are dealing - with an unlimited area, But in the Mediterranean it is absolutely necessary that vessels should pass: certain points between; peninsulars and islands ; and. there the enemy will always come and wait for them.-CAPTAIN KELLY :. There always comes a point where they require to wait..ADMIRAL JELLICOE : There you; must put your patrols, and they must-concentrate. There is one point in; regard to the patrolled routes which is of : importance. One of the arguments used in - favour of fixed routes patrolled is that you can have trawlers or patrol vessels along the route at intervals of 20. miles. The total number of patrol vessels available between Malta and Port Said is ninety of which nevermore than sixty can by any possibility be at sea. The total distance is 960 miles, and therefore you cannot possibly: have more than one trawler for every 15 miles, and it would probably work out one for every 20 miles.;;.:&apos;; ADMIRAL FATOU:. I should like to. say. that I have seen passing at Malta a convoy of fourteen colliers in couples with each couple escorted by three trawlers. That means twenty-one trawlers for this one.convoy of colliers.VICE-ADMIRAL OLIVER:  That is not authorised.   That is the first we haveheard of it. :;;\.::-: ,V;&apos;(;v&quot;; -;;v-.ADMIRAL J EL LIGOE : Would it not be better to appoint a. Sub-Committee to settle this question ? &quot;.&apos;VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON : Yes. because it is necessary, to reach agreement.ADMIRAL JELLICOE : Perl laps, Admiral De Bon, Admiral Fatou and Admiral Corsi will further, consider it: VICE-ADMIRAL CORSI: It is a very important question.ADMIRAL JELLICOE: Then perhaps it had better be referred to a Sub-. Committee which could meet to-morrow morning before the general Conference.; &apos;-.It is now proposed.to discuss the. question of the protection of the drifters in the . Otranto Barrage.   Will Admiral Lacaze address us on that subject? &quot;&apos;:; v REAR-ADMIRAL LAGAZE -The general question: of the Otranto Barrage &apos; suggests that there must be unity of command, and the different elements of the question cannot be discussed separately.  ;
CAPTAIN KELLY: The whole question of the Barrage is based. on the necessity of having a person in absolute command; that is to say, he must, have command: of the submarines, the destroyers working in advance, the trawlers, the drifters, and: the. escorting destroyers in the background. They. are. arranged in lines and are supposed to be placed so that the submarine has to come to tlie surface between; them and blow. If possible you want to have cross-patrolling to see them when they come up. In addition to that they must have a patrol of aircraft, so that the moment the submarine is seen the officer in command of the forces can take control of the whole of the elements-the destroyers to start chasing and.the trawlers to meet; them, and he can set Out his drifters as he wants them. With that idea they thought as we had most ships there we could come to some agreement about it.ADMIRAL JELLICOE : In connection with this subject I might mention that I telegraphed to ascertain what protection had been afforded to the drifters of the Barrage last week, and the reply was &quot; none.&quot;REAR-ADMIRAL MARZOLO : Was that on the north or the south ?.ADMIRAL JELLICOE : It is not stated; The vessels used for; patrols,:such as trawlers mounting two 12-pr. guns, and six small torpedo boats, were no protection against raids of Austrian destroyers. Last week all these, were in harbour on account of bad weather.   Admiral Corsi remarked on the question; of the unity of command ofthe Barrage.VICE-ADMIRAL CORSI: I think the Admiral should have command of the Barrage consisting of a. line nf drifters and trawlers aud a line of torpedo boats when weather allows. Sometimes the torpedo boats are not out because of weather, as in this case you mentioned. In the centre are the drifters, which are British.. AH those on the surface are under the command of the Admiral of the British.. ADMIRAL JELLICOE : Who is in command of the Barrage?:VICE-ADMIRAL CORSI: Captain Spiro has control of the Italian lines. . :yv ADMIRAL JELLICOE : What have you there at present ? &apos;     &quot;.REAR-ADMIRAL MARZOLO : Fifteen; trawlers, eighteen torpedo boats and twenty-eight small torpedo boats.; (Vice-Admiral CorsI and Bear-Admiral Marzolo explained what the position was at present.)-ADMIRAL JELLICOE: Then the French portion I suppose is under the command of a special officer. I do. not wish to bargain at all, but we are working under the French, ill one part of the Mediterranean and under, the Italians in another /part of the Mediterranean. How would it do if the control of the Barrage and every-- thing connected with the Barrage were placed under the command of our own officer. Commodore Heneage, who is under the command of the Duke d&apos;Abruzzi.VICE-ADMIRAL CORSI: Where is he?;.:..;; ADMIRAL JELLICOE.: In a yacht. &apos;,&apos; 7 y    &apos;VICE-ADMIRAL OLIVER: We sent him there to command the British portion of the Barrage. ::&apos;y\:    &quot;/^y-y/yy ;, -,; -!ADMIRAL JELLICOE: That is all the drifters and British craft that are there now. I believe Commodore Heneage is a very easy officer to work with, and, of course, he is under the Duke d-Abrnzzi. As unity of command of the force working on that Barrage seems to be very desirable, if not necessary, I.would like; to suggest that as we have the centre.portion of the Barrage, the drifters, perhaps it would be suitable if all the vessels which can be spared to work iu connection with that Barrage were under his command. cVICE-ADMIRAL CORSI: I think he is still in command of the drifters. :ADMIRAL JELLICOE : Yes, he is there now, and has been there about sixw,eeks.    . .. . : ., y;&apos;V, X&apos;y-y.      &apos;.      VICE-ADMIRAL CORSI: We cannot have special torpedo craft for the Barrage. To-day some may be there, and to-morrow we may order the ships elsewhere[300] - &apos; q
ADMIRAL JELLICOE : But he could be informed of that.   -. (After a short further discussion the Conference accepted the principle that Commodore Heneage, working under Admiral E.H.R. the&apos; Duke of Abruzzi, should be in command of the Otranto Barrage,-and vessels forming part of its defence. It was agreed that he should submit proposals for its organisation, and be empovoeredto call for any assistance which coidd be rendered by the force ivorking in connection with the Barrage.)(The Conference adjourned to 11 o[clock the following morning.)Second Day.ADMIRAL JELLICOE: We have received a report from the Sub-Committee on Question No. 5, dealing with zones in the Mediterranean. On this question the Conference has agreed to the plan shown on the chart marked &quot; C.&quot; The result is that the French have an addition to their zone and the British have an addition to their zone as shown, and the trade entering this dangerous, area does not make the change of zone; at so dangerous a place as it did before.SIR EDWARD CARSON : I think a ship was sunk the other day at a point where the zones separate. That was not satisfactory. 1 understand we can record that as a decision of the Conference.ADMIRAL JELLICOE: On the question of routes in the Mediterranean, the first portion of Question No. 6, the Sub-Committee has reported.VICE-ADMIRAL SIR H. OLIVER read the report of the Sub-Committee.The Conference agreed to this report, which was as fellows :  :&quot;As a result of the discussion the following decisions were arrived at :-:.    &quot;In the Western Basin of the Mediterranean it was agreed :-:&quot; That the coastal route should be utilised as much as possible, and that each country should decide as to whether their vessels should take the direct route from Marseilles to Algiers, that is, by the route arranged by the French Ministry of Marine.&quot;That the question of protection with nets of certain ports should be looked into, and if the British Government can spare any nets they will communicate with the Ministry of Marine at Paris and Rome as to where they would suggest these nets being placed.&quot;In the Eastern Basin of the Mediterranean it was agreed&quot;To adopt the proposed French system of fixed routes,  frequently changed, for traffic to arid from Saloniea and the iEgean, and to adopt the //proposed English system of dispersion for traffic between Cape Bon and Port Said for British vessels and Alliecl vessels if desired.. &quot; That the British undertake to maintain the patrols on the French routes, and that no patrol vessels will be diveited from these patrols for employment in connection with the dispersed routes. After a period of trial, the working of the two systems to be compared at a Joint Conference, with a view to.the adoption of a permanent system..        ;:0:A-C&apos;      &apos; &apos;: &quot;General,h-;.&apos;. -&quot;It was agreed that the British Admiralty should arrange for a representative to be appointed on the staff of Rear-Admiral Fatou, and that, if possible, he should be Captain G.B. Powell, formerly on the staff of Admiral Limpus. The further question as to whether Admiral Fatou should be at Malta or at Bona will be investigated hy Admiral de Bon, and a further communication sent in due course.&quot; It was agreed that stations for aircraft should be organised at Lampedusa and Marsala (in Sicily), so that the French aircraft from Bizerta can utilise these places, and consequently increase their radius of action; these sub-bases to be available for the British aircraft from Malta, as also the British station at Malta to be available to the French aircraft from Bizerta. Generally, that British or French aircraft should use any of these stations as may be necessary.&quot;
SIR EDWARD CARSON : Then we will record that assent. It is very easy to put it on paper, but everything will depend upon the carrying out of it.ADMIRAL JELLICOE: Then I understand there is a point open with regard to the shipping on the Mediterranean routes.VICE-ADMIRAL SIR H. OLIVER : The British will arrange for a representative to be on the staff of Rear-Admiral Fatou. That representative will be Captain Powell, who has been at Malta and is fully acquainted with the; working. The question of whether Rear-Admiral Fatou should be at Malta or at Bona will be looked into by Admiral:de Bon.ADMIRAL JELLICOE: Is Captain Powell available?VICE-ADMIRAL OLIVER: Yes.SIR EDWARD CARSON : Then that will also be recorded.:. ADMIRAL JELLICOE : On Question No. 7 the decision recorded yesterday was that the Conference accepted the principle that Commodore Heneage, who is under the command of Admiral H.R. II. the Duke d&apos;Abruzzi, shouldy be in command of the Otranto Barrage and vessels forming part of its defence. It/was agreed that he should submit proposals for its organisation, and that he should be empowered to call for assistance such as could be rendered by the . forces working in connection with the Barrage.CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY: We have prepared a little report with reference to Question 7, and with your permission I will read it.Captain di Villarey&apos; read the report, prepared by the Italian representatives, which was as follows : yy&apos;&quot; With reference to paragraph 7, the Italian Delegates recognise. that the . means actually available for the Otranto Barrage are not sufficient for the purpose. But since it has been suggested that, for the more efficient organisation and the : ...  better defence of the drifters, it would be advisable to put this service under the command of a British naval officer, wrro would be under the orders of the Italian Commander-in-Chief;  the Italian Delegates concur with this suggestion, and unanimously declare that they will place at the disposal of the British Commodore ;    all the; craft available in those waters which are not employed elsewhere.&quot;y    ADMIRAL JELLICOE : Perhaps we can add that.SIR EDWARD CARSON : I think so.CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY: The Italian Minister requests that the work of the new British Commodore should not begin before the 1.5th January.; ADMIRAL JELLICOE: With regard to Question No. 8, as to offensive operations by navies, I understand yesterday it was agreed that such operations were not practicable in the Adriatic.CAPTAIN KELLY : That is so with regard to major operations, but minor operations were to be carried out.ADMIRAL JELLICOE : Y es,;.-minor offensive operations should be carried on^with energy. 7^7-:--*:X:-&apos;&quot;X-\;y.CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY: I would say &quot; for the present.&quot;SIR; El) WAR I) CARSON : Not major operations at present ?CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY : Not at present.y y ADMIRAL JELLICOE: As the troops advance, of course it might be possible ?SIR EDWARD CARSON : Then that would be joint operations. Here we; are dealing with naval operations.      - .    &apos;.y:-y - ADMIRAL JELLICOE: Then on Question No. 9 I think:the Italian; Minister of Marine has drawn up a report ?CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY : Yes, I will read it:-&quot;With reference to paragraph No. 9, the Italian: Delegates have-pointed out that the only enemy naval force to be confronted in the Mediterranean is the
Austrian fleet, shut in the Adriatic, and that therefore it is necessary to have ready and concentrated, at all times, a superior fleet in opposition.&quot; While this purpose was satisfactorily fulfilled by the fleet concentrated in article 2 of the Naval Convention, the situation, as altered&quot; by the withdrawal of the &apos; Queen&apos; division, would be urdavourably changed, especially if account is taken of the losses sustained thus far by the Italian Navy. ,&quot;Besides, military and political considerations, demand that the fleet should not only be ready to fight the Austrian fleet, but also to prevent raids or other /operations of any sort by naval detachments on the Italian coast. -:--./; &quot; For this second condition naval forces have so far been successfully main-: tained at Venice, Brindisi, and Vallona; and their Continuous service has conse-quently entailed deterioration and losses amongst the torpedo and light craft, &quot;y-y- &quot; For, these reasons the withdrawal of. the British Division.should take place only if a substantial French naval force were permanently stationed at Corfu. The. British Admiralty are to make every effort to; reinforce. the First Allied -      Squadron by a convenient number of light craft when.available.&quot; The Italian Delegates declare that should the Allies not take in consideration /&apos;.. - all these circumstances, the conditions on which the possibility is founded of -continuing the effort to bring the war to a successful conclusion would be seriously compromised.&quot;y y:V SIR EDWARD CARSON : That really;means that if we leave these ships there it will be a very serious matter to us ? - /ADMIRAL JELLICOE : I do &quot;not think it means that, because Admiral de Bon said they are: preparing to put ships at Corfu.VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON : They are at Corfu now, and it has been decided that we will always have one squadron at Corfu.ADMIRAL JELLICOE: The first condition, which is. that a substantial French Naval Force should be permanently stationed at Corfu, is; fulfilled. The second condition, that the First Allied Squadron ought to be reinforced by a Convenient number of light cruisers or destroyers, must depend on whether light cruisers and destroyers are available. At present there are certainly no light cruisers available. At this moment; as the Conference is aware, there is a German raider at large in the. Atlantic, and it has been so for at least six weeks certainly one, and there may be two and it is obvious that the first requirement is to get the raider, and that should be the first object of any. available cruiserswhich are at the disposal of this country, before anything of the kind suggested in this report of the Italian Delegates can be considered. We have already weakened the Grand Fleet by taking away one light cruiser, two cruisers, and four armed merchant vessels, in order to strengthen the Atlantic Force to find that raider, the existence of which imperils the safety not only of the British mercantile marine but of the French and Italian mercantile marine. . Therefore I hope the Italian Minister does not press: for our taking light cruisers away /from this purpose for the Adriatic, when it is quite, obvious they are much more required for other, services. The only enemy light cruisers in the. Adriatic which have any considerable speed are four.in number, and we keep; now in the Adriatic four an equal force. Is not that sufficient? Those enemy light cruisers have never been out of the Adriatic, have they ? // .: . -VICE-ADMIRAL CORSI : Not altogether, but they / have been out in they Adriatic.       &apos;  &quot;y -&apos; -        ;;&apos;y :yy--y       .&apos; /.. - .-       . ,     //-,SIR EDWARD CARSON: In the Adriatic, but not out of it. This proposal of the Italian Minister really does not relieve us from anything, because you are asking now, in lieu of this British division, which it was admitted yesterday was unnecessary in order to make the force there superior to the Austrian force, to have a substantial French naval force permanently stationed at Corfu, which compensates for the battle-ships,: and, in addition/a British naval force placed at the. disposal of the Allied, squadrons, to be further reinforced by a convenient force of light cruisers-and destroyers. :.:./\ y/.yy.;: - - .  &quot; /:/:ADMIRAL JELLICOE : It is a totally different thing.CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY : You. promised us destroyers should be sent there, and they are not there yet. :;-././ &quot; &quot;
ADMIRAL JELLICOE: For what service are the light cruisers ? CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY : There arc four.ADMIRAL JELLICOE : But the service is different from the service of battle-.&apos; ships--quite different-and therefore there is no; connection between battleships and an addition of light cruisers.   Our battleships never have been stationed near the Adriatic to prevent raids at any time,i;   VICE-ADMIRAL ;CORSI: It is not quite in connection. ; .    ;:SIR EDWARD CARSON : You want a quid pro quo, but it is a very large one.CAPTAIN DI. VILLAREY : At the beginning, perhaps, none of us realised that the light cruisers would be more useful there; than battleships,SIR EDWARD CARSON,: You will remember: that we have very large shores to defend all round. - -:-.yy &apos;-yy...yyyADMIRAL JELLICOE : We do not attempt to defend our shores from bombard-ment. The main fleet is away, as you know, at Scapa Flow, and the enemy may come over to-morrow, or any morning they like, and bombard any English East Coast&quot;town, and we.grin and bear it. &apos;:-. &apos; .   &apos; &apos;SIR EDWARD CARSON: We have to./ADMIRAL JELL ICOE: I suggest that Admiral Corsi should also grin and bear it. The lamp-posts are waiting outside there for Sir Edward Carson and myself when the next bombardment takes place at Scarborough, and we have to grin and bear it.SIR EDWARD CARSON : Admiral Corsi is probably thinking of what I am thinking of, name!y, when the; House :of. Commons meets, questions will be asked : &quot;What about submarines ? &quot; and I know there is a conspiracy to attack me at once; but I do not mind it. - ,  &apos; &quot; &apos; &quot;VICE-ADMIRAL CORSI: But what will they say to me when I go back to Italy with empty hands ? . &apos; &apos;SIR EDWARD CARSON : Have you got&apos; an empty hand when you have the undertaking of the French to keep a very large force always at Corfu ? What we an; really out to consider is what is best, without minding what anybody says, I under-stood yesterday it was conceded that all our - four shi ps there were, really waste. Can anybody in the present state of affairs in the war defend wasting anything? It is no use saying &quot;Give us a quid pro quo.&quot; The question is whether those ships.are waste or not.&apos; If they are waste, I do not think any of our Allies would say there ought to be waste.VICE-ADMIRAL CORSI: There were four ships two years ago, and now conditions are changing. It is not now a question of big ships, but of small ships. You may retire the four big ships, of course, but substitute something for the new conditions of the war-some light ships or some destroyers. &quot;-v  CAPTAIN KELLY : You would like that, or do you insist on that ?     , SIR- EDWARD CARSON : We would like very much to give them to you.CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY : Admiral Jackson said that he-would send destroyers when he could. . ^&apos; V/ -&apos; - - :- &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos;::-&apos;y * .:;ADMIRAL JELLICOE: We will when we can. -&apos; CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY : They began by sending four, but they never arrived, because they were occupied in escorting ships. j . .ADMIRAL JELLICOE : Because that was necessary. .. . SIR EDWARD CARSON : When we can we will, send you coal, as I hope we shall be able to, and I am sure you will be glad to get it. V   \.; -VICE-ADMIRAL CORSI : You do not send enough coal now.SIR EDWARD CARSON: I had great difficulty in finding nine or ten ships and I diverted the coal from Malta because I saw how much you wanted it. We have to try and protect all those routes with small craft,[300] H
CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY : The question of coal and of transport is a very-serious question in the war.&apos;.&apos;  SIR EDWARD CARSON : Quite so, and I only like you to think that we are doing our very best.VICE-ADMIRAL CORSI: General Dall&apos;01io tells me that by the 1st March unless we have coal we cannot have munitions enough.ADMIRAL &quot;JELLICOE: In mentioning those four destroyers, those were destroyers which were to go to the Otranto Barrage.CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY: Yes, that is why we want them. They were going to the barrage, and we understood that some more would follow when it was possible.ADMIRAL JELLICOE: You may be quite certain there is necessity for ships there, and the ships will come the moment they are available, but it is impossible to send them before the ships are in existence.        - &apos;CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY: Our Admiral only demands that the necessity and convenience of sending more 1 ight craft there should be admitted and recognised.ADMIRAL JELLICOE : We are quite ready to recognise it, and we do recognise the certain necessity for destroyers. In regard to light cruisers, I am not quite so certain.CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY : I prefer the destroyers to light cruisers.ADMIRAL JELLICOE : I can only say we will do our best, if you will take my word for that.VICE-ADMIRAL CORSI: Then that is all right.SIR EDWARD CARSON : Is there any objection to putting it in this way: For these reasons the withdrawal of the British Division should only take place if a permanent French naval force is stationed at Corfu, and the British are to make every effort to reinforce the First Allied &quot;Squadron by a convenient number of light cruisers and destroyers when available. -VICE-ADMIRAL CORSI: That is right.CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY: You might say &quot;light craft.&quot;SIR EDWARD CARSON : Instead of &quot; light cruisers ? &quot; W7hat about the use of Greek destroyers which you suggest should be contemplated in this connection ? Is it not better not to put that in?::yy&apos; CAP IAIN DI VILLAREY: That is merely a suggestion of the Minister ofMarine.ADMIRAL JELLICOE: I discussed the question with Admiral Lacaze and Admiral de Bon yesterday, and we came to the conclusion that the Greek destroyers could not go to M. Venizelos. .VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON: They are to reinforce the &quot;Suffrens&quot; on the transport route for the Allied army at Salonica, and they are all employe a on this.ADMIRAL JELLICOE : Except those which are in repair a large proportion.SIR EDWARD CARSON : It would not matter if we leave in those words &quot;that it may be considered,&quot; but it is really misleading, because I do not think we are in a ] position to do it. -&quot;*&apos;-:;&apos;-.-ADMIRAL JELLICOE : If the Greek destroyers become available, and are not - required for the transport route. &apos;?yy / -VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON: The question is, is it indispensable to keep your men in the Adriatic, and is it desirable to reinforce the destroyers and smaller craft, or is it possible ? ;/y y.&apos;yy- / y V: :y.y- .  y y: &apos;       &quot;ADMIRAL JELLICOE : It is desirable, but at the moment not possible.VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON :. Another question, which is quite different, is as to the use of Greek destroyers. Those are three questions, the first of which is : Is it advisable:to keep the battleships at work in the Adriatic or not ?
ADMIRAL JELLICOE: Politically, it might be unwise to use Greek destroyers far from Greece. -VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON : Certainly.. ADMIRAL JELLICOE: It would not be quite (air to the; Greeks, because their primary duty should be to the Army going to Greece, to ensure its safety, I think. I suggest not putting that question under this heading. Before leaving this&apos; question of the battleships in the Mediterranean, I presume we must discuss with our French -colleagues the question of any additional force to replace the battleships which we withdraw from the Eastern Mediterranean. It is a question of what force &quot;is necessary, to ensure the &quot; Goeben&quot; not escaping.VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON: We have discussed that question, and it was;said it was better to send two &quot; Patries,&quot; and I think that will be sufficient.ADMIRAL JELLICOE: Yes, and- we will strengthen the others as soon as. we can.VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON : We can communicate with you before withdrawing those battleships. ;;,; -SIR EDWARD CARSON : Before we leave the question of the Mediterranean I throw; out for your consideration; whether, there;, is any necessity for more frequent Conference between: the &quot;French, the Italians and British, at some place which is convenient, I do not mean that you should come here or to Paris, but whether it would; not be a good thing to have some method, of meeting periodically/These letters and despatches and telegrams; are very unsatisfactory, and very often in an hour or two hours one could do much more if one could meet. I do not know where is the most convenient place for meeting, but if you Inujl an exchange of views periodically it -occurred to me that it would be businesslike.      ./:.-,-.--;---.,&apos;-----;ADMIRAL JELLICOE : Argostoli or Otranto.- SIR EDWARD CARSON : I think we might record it so as to have it before the Ministry of each country, that it was agreed that there; should be periodical local meetings. i(The Delegates signified their assent.)ADMIRAL JELLICOE : The next is the question which is being considered by the Sub-Committee.   I understand they are not quite ready with their report.SIR EDWARD CARSON : Then I think we might adjourn now until a quarter past three, when I understand everything will be ready for us.(Adjourned for a short time.)SIR EDWARD CARSON : I hope all the members, of the Conference have a copy of this; report handed in by the Sub-Committee on the remaining questions. Whatever discussion arises on the report seems to me to arise out of the first paragraph. I do not know whether the members of the Conference know that as regards the first of the suggestions made the British Government at the present moment are taking active;/ measures to ascertain first, how the country stands at present in relation to what may. be called essential imports-those things that are absolutely necessary during the future months of the war. I. think I may say, though it is not finally settled, that we are absolutely determined to cut down all those imports which are not absolutely necessary for the food of the people, and for continuing the necessary supplies of things essential to the prosecution of the war. I think, speaking in the presence of. the. Shipping Controller, I.may say that we have; in mind an idea whereby we will be able to make very drastic - alterations. Of course we have to do it with. the least possible incon-venience, but I think, knowing as I. do my colleagues in the Government, I may assure the members of this Conference from France and from Italy, that we will drastically;;V act in order to take care that our shipping is put only to the uses which are of paramount necessity for the; maintenance of the country and the due prosecution of the war. I do not think I need go into details. That is what the first paragraph of the Sub-Committee&apos;s report contemplates, and we shall be glad to have the assurance that the French Government. and the Italian Government are going to occupy their shipping in exactly the same way; that is, that they will not allow their mercantile
marine to-be turned1 to any purposes except those that are essential. for the main-: tenance of their respective populations, and to provide such material as is necessary for equipment, munitions, and matters, of that kind for the due prosecution of the war. I think myself that the International Shipping Committee, which paragraph No. 2 in the report proposes to set up, will be of use in every respect for carrying out that policy. We can interchange with each other on that International Committee what each country is doing. I think nothing creates a greater feeling of, I will not say suspicion, but of uneasiness, than if any one country were to imagine that the operations of one of the other countries were in order to try and capture trade or business which had belonged to that other-country, but which had to be given up for the purpose of carrying out this ;&apos;pqlicy&apos; of; merely introducing essential imports into the country. Therefore I hope when this International Shipping Committee is formed the fullest information and frankest information, and every detailed particular that can be ^iven will be interchanged between the three Allies. They will each then be informed of what the other is not only doing but of what. it is able to do, and they will be able to make suggestions to each other. In that way we shall each know what it is that each of the three allied countries wants most. Having that kind of information, instead of living, as I call it, from hand-to mouth, that is, merely taking what arises to-day and trying, to satisfy that, we shall be in a position, supposing Italy is very badly off for coal, or France is badly off for coal, or we are badly off for something else, to rearrange our shipping arrangements in;such a way that we can accommodate ourselves, not merely to that which arises at the moment, but have a programme, so that even if there are two essentials we can know, which, of them we can brush aside so as to supply that which is an absolute deficiency. So far as we are con-cerned, we have known very little about the powers and capacities of the mercantile marine in France and also in Italy, and it is very difficult for us to realise to the fullest extent the wants of our two Allies, whom we are only too anxious to helpin every possible way, but this we cannot do without having the fullest details of. how their own mercantile marine is being employed. Therefore, if there are Competent men, as I hope will be the case, put upon the International Shipping Committee, they will be able to frame in due time a programme, and a census/in such a way that we shall turn to the best use the merchant ships of each of the three countries. There is another matter which may not come strictly under No. 3, but on which! am extremely anxious, and about which we know nothing here. At the present moment we are devoting a great deal of our attention to the building of merchant-ships.; There is. another report submitted upon that subject, but I only want to suggest that; it is a very germane subject to the one I have been discussing, because it is quite apparent that; as. the mercantile marine of each of the three countries becomes diminished if it does, as it probably will-by submarines.and other methods of the kind, we should take care that the shipbuilding in all the three countries goes on as far as possible to the fullest/extent. It is also germane in that for the shipbuilding there are certain materials that have to be ; forthcoming. You cannot leave out of account, in; considering the question of imports and the use to which the mercantile marine is put. the necessity of employing a certain portion, of the mercantile marine for the purpose of bringing, in the necessary materials for keeping up they mercantile navy.The rltalian: representatives have put forward certain premises and conclusions with reference to; the condition of affairs in regard to the necessary imports for their country-quite naturally and quite rightly. May I say that it must not be taken, or so Iuuderstand, that because these conclusions are . not embodied in the resolution therefore they are in any. wise turned down. I apprehend that all these questions which are put forward by the Italian rej -reseutatives are questions that would arise just as French and -English ones will arise on the International Committee. I should not like the Italian representatives to think for a moment that those were not matters in which we; in conjunction with their representatives on the Committee, are / intensely interested, or matters on which we should not try to meet as far as we... can their views and their wants. In coming to these conclusions I hope they/will quite understand: that nobody could be more anxious than the. British Government Is in every,way to pool;our resources for the common good, so that all wants thatcan.be satisfied will be satisfied,.so that so far as possible each of the Allies will get their fair share of all that is - necessary for the prosecution of the war. I do not know whether we may take as agreed Nos. 1 and 2 of the report ?CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY:  The Italian Delegates think that the Italian resolutions Nos. 1 and 2 would: have been better than the general resolutions of the
Conference. It must be understood that in Italy we are eating black bread, we have two meatless days/no confectionery, and an absence of many other things. Secondly, we are in great need of. coal.SIR EDWARD CARSON : I think all we could do about that would he to attach it as a proposal of the Italian Delegates. We should not have power to frame a law of that kind. That would have to be done by&quot; the War Cabinet. If it is put upon the face of this Report under No.. 1 as a sub-section, suggesting the elimination of all forms of articles of consumption which are not completely essential, and also No. 2, dealing with the reduction of certain things, it will be considered by the War Cabinet. We have no power to go into that at all. It would be for the Italian Government to take up the matter with the Government of this country. It is something very much like what we are enquiring into at the present moment, and considering how far it will have to be carried out. If you are satisfied to have it attached to the resolution as your proposals, the matter will be considered by the British Government.CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY: There is also the second paragraph.-The production of munitions will be stopped in March, and the offensive not only made impossible,&quot; but the defensive imperilled, ::; - \v;vvv.       :,:/; . -SIR EDWARD CARSON : That must be reported to the War Cabinet,CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY : We desire that it should be embodied in the resolutions of the Conference in the strongest possible way. The Prime Minister said we should -speak frankly. We have&apos; spoken very frankly. Wevcannot speak more frankly than that, v Ab^y yyyy-/::y;-y:y&apos;y.---&apos;SIR EDWARD CARSON: Certainly, I am not objecting to it being put upon the Report of the: Conference, but I only say we are not in a position here to tell you that we can give you anything in accordance with: your note. I am not in a position to say that, but I can only say that I will put it before the War Cabinet.SIGNOR ANCONA: We quite agree that we are not able to. decide to-day, and we only propose it. in the hope that the Conference will vote on it. The first question is: Are the Allies making the best use of their ships, and how best can each help the other ? We think the best way in which to help the other combatants is just in that respect which we.suggest. It seems to me that our Chairman said just the same thing a few moments ago. I understand why our order of the day would not be to vote upon it, and on that question we have no more to say. The question must be put before the War Cabinet. We cannot, say that it must be done, but if to-day we give a vote upon it the question will then have much more importance when brought before the War Cabinet. For the last three or four or five months we have been importing . only materials which are essential for the war, and for the food of the population. We have for a long time given up the importation of any material which is not necessary for the food of the population, and we have limits as regards meat, coal, sugar, and bread. We think the best way to save tonnage is to import-much less sugar and much less wheat, and also to consume less bread, less sugar, less coal, and less meat. We think what we have been doing for the last three or four months, though it would not be very easy,, could also be done by the English. General Dall&apos;Olio says that in a few months he is not going on with the production of arms and munitions if he is not able -to get very quickly a certain amount of coal. I can assure you that we are very short of wheat and rice. Our opinion is that if we really wish to help each other we must try to go on in the way which is now proposed in our order of the day. I quite concede that we are not able to say it.must be done, but I think if this is taken as an order of the day, it will go before- the War Cabinet, after having been first voted on by this Conference, and will then have more weight when brought to the attention of the War -Cabinet.;&apos;-:-&quot;.&apos; ;;&apos;:-.-vv^^r^VV.&apos;.^^ Vv.--y &apos;VICE-ADMIRAL CORSI: We are discussing about meat and sugar, but I think it better to study everything.SIR EDWARD CARSON;: You must not imagine that we are not in want of things Over here. We are in want of plenty of things and find very many difficulties. I know I have had no sugar for the last four, days,;and could not get any.; It is a small thing,; but it only shows that even; although you have the money to buy it, you cannot get it.. Supposing, we say that the Conference were of opinion that the following suggestions, of the Italian Government, as you have put them there, firstly and. secondly, should be at once brought to tho notice of the War Cabinet ?SIGNOR ANCONA: That means they have the approval of the Conference.!&quot;3001 I
SIR EDWARD CARSON: No, it means the Conference thinks they should be taken into immediate consideration by the War Cabinet.SIGNOR ANCONA: We prefer that our order of the day be approved plainly and completely, but if it is not possible we must be satisfied with the suggested resolution. -SIR EDWARD CARSON : You must remember that some of us here are Ministers who are Members of the Government, and we do not bring forward conclusions of that kind without our colleagues being consulted, and having the matter argued before them. Otherwise, if I were invited to the War Cabinet, I should go pledged to a particular matter, and should probably have disagreement with my colleagues then..VICE-ADMIRAL CORSI: Can those questions be presented as recommended by the Conference ?SIR EDWARD CARSON : I do not think we can go further than to say that it-is the opinion of this Conference that these two resolutions of the Italian repre-sentatives should be at once taken into consideration by the War Cabinet of the British Government..     y/v/yy;/&apos;.;&apos;VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON: What we have now is the general results in regard to all the Allies, and the prosecution of the war depends upon the generality of those results. It is certain that each country has begun to meet very great difficulties. We have no coal, and at the beginning of the war we had less coal in our harbours than the Italians in theirs. It is a very bad situation. We have been obliged to do without steam, and have had to reduce the production of munitions. The situation is at the present moment very serious, but I am confident that the only possible way to clear this situation is to examine exactlv the total of that situation, and to see how we can regularise the total of our resources.; For that reason I do not see any way other than to accept those two propositions since we are actually putting into the hands of the proposed International Committee the task of clearing this situation.VICE-ADMIRAL CORSI: The first proposition is the question of transports-that is one thing-and. i am not so certain that transport facilities are sufficient. I think we must consider the distribution of transports, and we must reduce the consumption of several things. I think without the combination of those two we cannot come to much good result; there must be better distribution of the transports and reduced consumption of everything possible. &apos; .SIR EDWARD CARSON : I think, it must be one of the&apos;means. The resolution says that by co-operative programmes or otherwise the transport of essential articles may be increased. That involves the cutting down of non-essential articles. In that, of course, will arise the question as to what is essential and what is non-essential, which, again, is a relative phrase having regard to the means you have at hand. You may get down to saying such a thing is essential because to-day we are able to do it, but to-morrow when we are not able to do it, it has to go into the non-essential things, so that by degrees we shall get down in that way, but I do not think we can pin ourselves to any one form.; or another. It is not merely the question of reducing rations and rationing the people, but there are a great many other things to be considered and cut down. If one party wishes to mention one;- thing, another may wish to mention another. I think we had better leave it where it is, though I,am quite willing to put upon the record that the Conference were of opinion that the proposals of the Italian Government as contained in (D),.should be.immediately brought to the notice of the War Cabinet for consideration, if that will meet&apos;the views of the Italian Delegates.VICE-ADMIRAL CORSI: Yes.SIR EDWARD CARSON : Then No. 2 is: &quot;The Conference were further of opinion that the following proposal, put forward by the Italian representatives, should be brought t6 the immediate notice of the War Cabinet&quot;-and then set it out as you have done it in D (l) and (2). :ADMIRAL JELLICOE : If Admiral de Bon could make a statement in similar terms we should know exactly where we are.SIR EDWARD CABSON : I think we might also add this : &quot; The represeuta-tives of France and Italy impressed upon the Conference the absolute necessity of a
constant and continuous supply of coal to Franco and Italy, having regard to the fact that without such supply the production of munitions would be gravely imperilled.&quot;VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON: Yes.COMMODORE HALSEY : As far as the French coal trade is concerned, a committee has been sitting with Commander Vandier upon it, and there are certain improvements in carrying coal from England.- to France which undoubtedly, when carried out-and possibly they can be carried out quite easily-will make a great improvement in the output of coal from this country to France. We did not touch very deeply on it because it had already been very thoroughly discussed with Commander Vandier. I think there is no doubt that a great improvement will be made in that way.. Practically speaking, there is a good deal of coal carried from west to east and from east to west which can be avoided.by carrying from west to west and from east to east. There are other small ways of getting coal across in small craft from various other ports not used at present, like Exmouth. Those proposals are being considered now, and it is probable, and in any case possible, that the output of coal will be larger.SIR EDWARD CARSON: Still, you do not think it wild do any harm that the matter should be kept constantly before:the War Cabinet, because it will enableus to endeavour more and more to o-et those facilities ?COMMODORE HALSEY: Quite so.SIR EDWARD CARSON : Further, on the same subject: as regards the French side, we will expect-and I think the French representatives will say naturally-as great efforts as possible to be made to have the transport of coal on the other side-that is, on the French side-facilitated. 1 need hardly say, because it is a common-place, that quickly loading and getting away your ship makes it almost equal to another ship. I know there has been considerable improvement made in the ports of France during recent times, but I really would urge Upon the French that there should be no delays of any kind in letting us have the ships back as quickly as ever they can be given, for the purpose of transporting more and.more. Every hour is, in the present condition of affairs.- absolutelv essential. We cannot afford to waste one moment.- I myself am very anxious, from the point of view of the Admiralty, that our transport officers at the various ports abroad should be men of the very greatest diligence, and should devote every moment of their time and energies in clearing ships as soon as possible after they have unloaded there. I think it is very essential that both sides should bear that in mind in reference to this question of coal.VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON : In the past there have been delays, and in the conditions we have had to face it can be easily imagined ; but I do not think you will find that such delays are very serious now.SIR EDWARD CARSON : I know there has been a good deal of improvement.-   REAR-ADMIRAL DE LOSTENDE: Every effort is made now to clear out transport ships and send them back to sea.   Improvements have been made, and further improvements will be made.SIR EDWARD CARSON: I am very glad to hear that. As regards ship construction, the French representatives have handed in a statement of their require-ments in materials in the nature of steeland engines. The Third Sea Lord has promised that every effort shall be made to meet those, requirements through the Ministry of Munitions.; As regards the thirteen merchant cargo-boats which are building, arrangements will be made for the immediate supply of the outstanding material required.   May I ask how soon those thirteen ships will be completed?   -INGENIEUR ZIEGEL: Six sh ips are launched; the engines and boilers are ready, and only some details remain to be completed, for which a certain quantity of material is. wanted about 2,000 tons of steel plates and bars. I suppose those ships would be completed in about six or seven months.SIR EDWARD CARSON: What about the other seven ?INGENIEUR ZIEGEL: The other seven are very far from completion. I do mot suppose it is possible to consider their completion during this year; it would be only next year. ; v&quot; &quot; 7.-^&apos;&quot; &quot;
: vSIR EDWARD CARSON : The next year may be of importance.  yINGENIEUR- ZIEGEL: The: quantity of material required for those ships- . would be very considerable.SIR EDWARD CARSON : Are the French working on them every day ?INGENIEUR ZIEGEL : It would be necessary to obtain more men, and I am afraid we should have many difficulties to get over. We have been in negotiation with the Italian Government to obtain some workmen, and we hope to obtain a lew, but I ant hot sure that we; shall be able to get many. We shall want, perhaps, 1,500 or 2,000 more men to complete these seven other ships during next year. &apos;.. SIR EDWARD CARSON : Are the French Government haying any ships built outside FranceMn any other countries ?INGl-CNIEUR ZIEGEL : I believe none, except that over here we have three -y&quot;). sloops.   Of merchant-ships there are none. -SIR EDWARD CARSON : Nor in America or Japan or anywhere else ? .    -INGENIEUR ZIEGEL: I have no knowledge of any. We have bought a special ship for cables. :.y.yy/yy/Zyy/yy-- SIR EDWARD CARSON : I suppose I may take it that it is impossible under any circumstances for France to undertake the building of any more ships, large orsmall ?INGSNIEUR ZIEGEL: I do.not think they could do it, having regard to the .  completion of the thirteen ships now lying on the stocks and the warships which we have to complete for patrols - -gun-boats, and so on.   That is a sufficient load for the French shipbuilding.   1 do not think there is the possibility of their doing more than that.VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON : We have no men.SIR EDWARD CARSON : Have you any more slips you could use if you had the labour ?VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON : Yes, we have slips, but no men and no machinery.INGENIEUR&apos;ZIEGEL : Yes, we have plenty of slips in France, but no materials and no labour.SIR EDWARD CARSON: Since the commencement of the war have they bought any ships from America ?INGENIEUR ZIEGEL : Not to my knowledge-only ships for the Government, warships and trawlers./REAR-ADMIRAL DE LOST END E : And a very few tugs.INGENIEUR ZIEGEL: I do not know if private firms have bought ships in America.   I know they have tried.REAR-ADMIRAL DE LOSTENDE : The prices are so high.SIR EDWARD CARSON: Are all the  merchant-ships  requisitioned  by the -      Government in France?CAPTAIN KELLY: At a recent date only thirty-one were not being used by theGovernment.SIR EDWARD CARSON : It is proposed to try to get some engines for motor-lighters and for tugs in this country. The French have agreed to facilitate supplies of steel material, but they say the qualities should be reduced to two, namely, boiler plates and constructional material ; and secondly, that the nearest British dimensions should be accepted instead of metric dimensions. That, no doubt, is a matter which the Third Sea Lord will take up. - yCAPTAIN DI VILLAREY: We have many minor questions of that kindOurselves.SIR EDWARD CARSON : I am coming to the Italian question in a moment. Is it proposed that these questions of construction should come before this International
Committee, and, if it is not so proposed, would not that be a convenient way in which to do it ? That Committee will be going into all the wants of the merchant service. What do you say, Sir Joseph Maclay ?SIR JOSEPH MACLAY: I do not know that the International Committee could decide it very well.SIR EDWARD CARSON: You think it will have to be a requisition from the Government ?SIR JOSEPH MACLAY : I think so, or through.the Government.SIR EDWARD CARSON: I suppose the Conference will simply say that they adopt the report of the Sub-Committee with, reference to the production as contained in this French memorandum which I have referred to.VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON : Yes.SIR EDWARD CAR.SON : As regards Italian ship construction, their require-ments have been handed in, I understand, but I have not seen them yet.CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY: I;will send them to you to-morrow.SIR EDWARD CARSON : I should like to ask the Italian representatives to tell me what merchant-ships thev have under construction at present.VICE-ADMIRAL CORSI: We are Marking at nothing else but construction.SIR EDWARD CARSON : Have you any ships laid down ?SIGNOR ANCONA : Yes; three or four merchant-ships are laid down, but we are waiting for materials. We have some materials, and we shall be able to build this year ten or twelve merchant-ships.SIR EDWARD CARSON : How long will they take ?SIGNOR ANCONA : One and a half years.SIR EDWARD CARSON : Are they of a standard size or in different sizes?SIGNOR ANCONA : Standard size.SIR EDWARD CARSON : About what tonnage ?SIGNOR ANCONA : 8,000 tons.SIR EDWARD CARSON : Are you purchasing any merchant-ships? SIGNOR ANCONA : We are trying to buy some.SIR EDWARD CARSON: Then I suggest that this matter, in a similar way, should be accepted and recorded by the Conference, just as we did it with regard to the French statement. ,[Tlie Conference signified their assent.)SIR EDWARD CARSON : 1 shall be very much obliged if Admiral Volkov, the Russian representative present, will tell us anything he can about Russian shipbuilding.ADMIRAL VOLKOV : As far as I know, there is nothing doing of that kind; no merchant-ships are building.SIR EDWARD CARSON : Is it not possible to build any ?ADMIRAL VOLKOV: Even before the war we did not do much building inthat line. .SIR EDWARD CARSON : No, but with the sinking of ships now it will be a matter of paramount importance.ADMIRAL VOLKOV: All we could, build would be in the Black Sea and in the Baltic, which are closed.   We could not build at Archangel for the use of anybody.SIR EDWARD CARSON : At all events, we may take.it there are no merchant-ships laid down by you.ADMIRAL VOLKOV: No.[300] K
SIR EDWARD CARSON : Before we separate, may I say I hope there will be no delay in appointing this International Committee. I hope the Governments of each country will nominate&apos; at the earliest moment their representatives, so as to let the Committee get to work in this country.CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY : It would help us very much to know what the British suggest.   How many representatives do they want ?.SIR EDWARD CARS ON : There should not be too many; I should think one from each country. A Committee does more business the smaller the body is ; that is my experience.;;; .CAPTAIN DI VILLAREY: I think it better to take them from amongst the officials already in this country.REAR-ADMIRAL DE LOSTENDE : There are plenty to do all the work.SIR EDWARD CARSON : I think we want representatives who are very much acquainted with the present state of affairs in each of the countries in order that there may be no delay. There must be a day or two&apos;s interval, in order to see who are the best men, but I should be prepared to appoint somebody at once to represent this country. &apos;. &quot;  &apos;Gentlemen, I think that concludes our business, which I hope will turn out satis-factorily, and we will try and get it all into action. I would like to express the thanks of His Majestys Government to the Italian representatives and the French repre-sentatives for coming here and meeting us in,I will not say such a friendly manner, but a brotherly manner, as we have all met here in the common cause.REPORT OP SHIPPING  COMMITTEE.First Day.On the First Lord&apos;s suggestion, it having been decided at the opening of the Conference that certain of the Agenda should be considered by Committees of the Conference, to: report to the Conference after formulating definite conclusions, a Committee consisting of the following members adjourned at about noon to the Old Board Room to consider (1), (2), (3), and (4) of the AgendaPresident: Fourth Sea Lord.French Delegates. Italian Delegates.M. de Joly. Signer Ancona.M. de Berlhe. -Signor General Dal!Olio., M. Monnet. - Commandante Baistrocchi.Capitaine de Fregate Vandier.-. :;: CommendatoreParodi.Ingenieur Ziegel. ---:-: Commandante Cicogna.&apos; M. Parent. &apos; ; Cavaliere Bragadin.Commeiidatore Attolico.Rear-Admiral Volkov attended on behalf of the Russian Government;  and &quot;Captain Edwards, Mr. Hoyden, and Mr. Salter on behalf of the Admiralty. The Shipping Controller was present for short periods. Mr. Gleadowe acted as Secretary.Agenda..1. Are the Allies making the best use of their shipping ; and how best can theyhelp one another for the common cause ? 2. The question of supply of coal to France and Italy / amounts required and meansof transport. &apos; &apos;3. Whether ithe congestion, at Fcenoh ports, due to lack.of-rolling-stock, can befurther relieved, and if so, how? 4. The shipbuilding resources of the three countries: what can be done towardsbuilding merchant-ships, and. their types-?
THE FOURTH SEA LORD began the discussion by a reference to the telegram which was sent to Rome and Paris, giving the Agenda, and say ing.that for (1) full information as to numbers, types, commitments, &amp;c., of shipping would be necessary/ He asked if the Allies had;brought with them such information,It appeared that the Italians had such information ready, but in a somewhat different form from the; information available at the Admiralty. The French had been unable to compile, such a statement.THE FOURTH SEA LORD thought that little headway could be made without a comparative statement, in the same form lor each Ally, of shipping statistics. It seemed best that this should be done by a small Sub-Committee, who would formulate the statements and.make recommendations to the Committee. . yThis proposal being agreed to, Mr. Salter was nominated to confer with a representative of each of the Allies; though it appeared doubtful whether, such a Sub-Committee cjuld in the available time get beyond the formulation of a statistical scheme preliminary to the detailed working out of the actual figures.SIGNOR AN CON A at this point advocated short general statements on the transport situation of each of the Allies. .M. DE JOLY demurred to this proposal, being of opinion that the only substantive points in such a statement must be the questions precisely defined in the Agenda underdiscussion. t .(Sir Joseph Maclay withdrew to go onto a Cabinet meeting,)THE FOURTH SEA LORD put it to the Committee that a combined detailed review was urgently required. In London all details of shipping for the British Empire, whether on Government or on private service, were immediately available : and it appeared to him that great good might come of a frank.exchange of such information here in London, which might go a iong way towards eliminating those two primary obstacles to the economic use of tonnage, delays in turning round, and journeys inballast. - v\&quot;y.;&apos;.He found some difficulty in opening the discussion. The necessities, commitments, and obligations of the different Allies were different: but there could be no two opinions as to the imperative necessity of not wasting a ton of shipping. That improvements were possible he had himself no doubt. The possibility of improving the coal service to France was already being closely canvassed at the Admiralty; and it was hoped that the supply of coal to France;would be increased without employment of additional tonnage, by a system-of carrying East Coast coal to Northern France, West Coast coal to Western France, ami other expedients. In the same way the frequent submarine embargoes, which held up the coal for Italy, challenged a close search for a possible remedy. Could not the French and Italian Delegates put forward immediately proposals for the -saving of tonnage in cases such as this; for the export of material from England to the Allies was a great part of the matter ?SIGNOR ANCONA returned to his advocacy of a general statement as to the shipping situation of each of the Allies. He professed complete ignorance of thesitua-tions of England and France, and was most, anxious to be put in a position to know how each of the Allies stood in this vital matter of tonnage.      .THE FOURTH SEA LORD was ready and glad to give the kind of general survey asked for from the English point of view, without going into figures. The problem had long ago resolved, itself into one of priority ; in fact we were desperatelv hard up for ships. We had to choose between such essential services as the carriage, of troops, munitions, and supplies for the armies in France, of wheat and other foocj-stuffs, and of ore and other raw: materials for munitions and warlike equipment. The supply of everything actually wanted was already in fact out of the question. In the last fortnight the Transport Department had been deluged with urgent demands for tonnage for all-important services which simply could not be met. He would be frank with the Allies: he would not hesitate to remind them of the numbers of ships loaned by England to them, viz. : To France: 6 passenger ships, 315 cargo ships. To Italy; 3 passenger ships, 102 cargo ships. To Russia: 2 passenger ships, 31 cargo ships. To other Allies: 8 cargo ships.
Those figures and the dire need of England for tonnage to-day were the measure of the extent of our determination to do our uttermost to help the Allies. He appealed to the Allies to consider the givi ng up of more requisites, to increase the tonnage avail-able for the, common cause. It was impossible to overestimate the value of any tonnage which the Allies might release in this way. We were doing what we could to secure the use of neutral tonnage, but that was a poor, second best. He was confident that, as we had done what we could -. to he] p. the Allies, and . would continue to do so, so the Allies were fully determined to help us in this vital matter of tonnage. To-this end he -invited their suggestions, instancing himself the elimination of all non-essential imports and; services, and the maximum use of railway transport. His statements of the shipping situation of the British Empire thus resolved itself into a statement of desperate need ; and he invited the Allies to give each his general survey, as suggested by Signor Ancona.SIGNOR ANCONA thought it might be best to adjourn till the afternoon before making these : statements, and M. de Joly put it that it might be well to appoint Sub-Committees for the three other Agenda.&apos;.&apos;../- THE FOURTH: SEA LORD, having ascertained that, at this point, neither Signor Ancona nor M. cle Joly had any general statement to make as to the need of their countries for tonnage/proposed that a Sub-Committee should be appointed to deal with (4) (Shipbuilding), the Third Sea Lord and; Sir Joseph Maciay to represent England.. This and the Sub-Committee for formulating statistics were agreed to, the proposal that the coA question should also be dealt with by a;Sub-Committee being dropped (M. cle Joly having pointed out that both this and the general shipping question depended on the statistical statement;. The Committee adjourned at 1/20, to meet again at 4 o&apos;clock to hear Signor Ancona&apos;s statement, which was as follows:-General Situation of the Italian Shipping Trade. .As Chairman of the Central Committee on Maritime Traffic, I think it my duty to explain briefly, but in all frankness, the actual situation of maritime transports in Italy, &quot;taking into account all tonnage available, on the one hand, and the imperative .- necessities of the war and the country on the other.We are ready to discuss all questions of detail, as, for instance, the more extensive ..; use of railway transit, the question of shipbuilding, and all; others that present them-selves, and it goes without saying that we shall be prepared; to give all possible co-operation within our power to any projects of the kind.   But it is incumbent upon us to place before you at oncebur general situation and our most urgent needs. &apos;-Before asking for further help, we feel bound to show that we have made all possible effo??ts ourselves. Therefore we state that the whole of the Italian mercantile marine, including liner space and sailers, is requisitioned, or otherwise controlled and employed for State purposes. It is not possible therefore to obtain any further contri-bution from our own mercantile marine...In addition to our mercantile fleet (440 ships, d.w.c 1,500,00 tons), we have at our disposal- - -(a.) Ex enemy steamers : 71 steamers, 400,000 d.w.c. (b.) Time-chartered: 106 steamers, 600,000 d.w.c. In total: 617 steamers, 2,500,000 tons.This fleet is absolutely insufficient for our needs in the matter of essential supplies, : notwithstanting the restriction in the consumption of bread, meat, sugar, coal, &amp;c, already imposed upon our population, and the fiict that all. importation of luxuries in - Italy is stopped.:The supplies essential to the continuation of the war for which the deficit is greatest are  . -; 1. Coal.. 2. Cereals..       Goal Situation.Italy must import monthly an absolute minimum of 800,000 tons.The tonnage actually employed (all details are available and ostensible) is only sufficient for the importation of 465,000 tons monthly, thus leaving a permanent deficit of 340,000 tons per month.
We must add that imports having fallen during the last three months from 800,000 to less than:500,000 tons, it has been found necessary to consume about 600,000 tons of different stocks, including N&quot;avy stocks..; (The total stocks are 1,500,000 ; Navalstocks, 800,000.) ;y--^In order to meet our requirements we ask : 1. That the c.i.f. coal, transported to Italy.by the British Admiralty, be increasedto 125,000 tons monthly: 50,000 ^ 75,000 tons. 2. That sixty steamers be secured under the licence system for coal.In addition to this, it is essential to reform our stocks to the extent to which they have been depleted,.and therefore at least 500,000:tons of c.i.f. coal is necessary.Should the aforesaid exceptional measures not be taken most urgently, the pro-duction of steel would have to be suspended in al! factories in Italy producing armsand munitions. -/&apos;-y   &apos; .       ,Wheat, Maize, and Rice.Our wheat requirements up to the 31st July amount to a further 1,343,000 tons not yot freighted, as can be shown. yWith the means at our disposal, including time charters, and assuming that the. Admiralty confirm their further allocation to Italy of 550,000 tons d.w.c, we should be able to import about the whole quantity.In this case, however, tonnage requirements: for maize and for rice remain com-pletely uncovered. For maize, our ascertained requirements are 750,000 tons, of which 500,000 are exclusively for direct&apos;human consumption.For rice, our minimum requirements are 200,000 ; that is to say, a total of about 350,000 tons .d.w.c., in addition to the supplementary tonnage required for wheat and for other cereals wanted for human consumption.This is the real situation and we are in a position to give the amplest proofs. Our requirements would involve about 775,000 tons deadweight capacity.. They represent the minimum indispensable for. the country ; this quite independent of the slight relief that, by common,agreements, We may be in a position to expect from railway traffic and the utmost despatch in unloading at our ports.The conclusion is very simple in its gravity. It is useless to repeat what Mr. Lloyd George so nobly expressed at this morning:s meeting1 that the war is one, that the victory of one is victory of all, and therefore every resource must be held in common.If the Allies are in a position to provide us the minimum tonnage essential, all will be well; if they are not, and if tonnage is mot sufficient to meet the whole of the Allies&apos; requirements, the only solution is to reduce consumption to the level imposed by the scarcity of tonnage.This would involve the imposition upon all allied populations of those particular food restrictions which shortage of transports render indispensable. It will therefore be necessary to establish a programme reducing consumption to the minimum feasible, and to distribute equally among the several populations unavoidable; sacrifices.MR. ROYDEN suggested that the wheat; difficulty was rather due to lack of : loading and; unloading facilities than to lack of ships. . At present Italy had more ships than there was wheat to put in them.   At Philadelphia, ships had been waiting a month to load wheat for Italy.SIGNOR ANCONA repeated his assurance that practically all Italian ships had been requisitioned, even sailing ships. Small craft were still required for trade with Africa; attempts to charter neutrals had not succeeded.M. DE JOLY (Sir Joseph Maclay now being present) professed himself aware of the gravity of the Italian situation, but feared that the French was no better. He gave, comparative statistics as to the increase of. tonnage in French ports since before the war, and as to the services on which French tonnage is employed. He showed that, whereas 4,000,000 tons are wholly controlled by the Government, only 1,000,000 tons are free-and of this 1.000,000 a. large proportion is employed supplying material (barbed wire, timber, &amp;c.) for essential Government contracts, undertaken by private enterprise. Extensive measures of restriction of imports and consumption had been, and were being, taken; lighting, both public and pr vate, reduced; trains taken off;: consumption of sugar and wheat cut down/ and the milling of flour regulated.   The[300] : V.&apos;. \ L
import of wood pulp had been altogether prohibited, and a Committee was in existence, under the Munitions Department, controlling all imports of metals and wood, with a view to freeing tonnage.All this was being done before August last. Since that date the situation had become increasingly critical. Up till August there had been a regular importation of 2,000,000 tons of coal a month into France. In the following months it fell to 1,800,000-1,500,000 tons, and at the present moment the monthly importation of coal into France was 1,000.000 tons short of essential requirements, viz., the supply of the armies and so on. Paris was now desperately short of coal; private householders can hardly get it at all. The P.L.M. Railway has only seven days&apos; stock. Already last year it was necessary to close down factories for lack of coal, and generally there is a grave shortage, not only for private comfort (which could be borne), but for big-essential industries..What was true of coal was true also of pig-iron and steel, of which 240,000 tons (pig-iron) were waiting in America for shipment to France.   ;An idea of the commitments of the French mercantile tonnage for military transport would be given by the fact that one-fifth of the total merchant service was devoted to the army at Salonica alone. All colonial services e.g., Indo-China service  had been reduced, and connection with New Caledonia severed altogether.Nevertheless, everything that could be done must be done, though it was hard to see where any saving could be effected, personal comfort being already reduced as much ; as possible and military requirements irreducible.THE FOURTH SEA LORD asked M. de Joly if nothing could be done to hasten the turning round of ships.M. DE JOLY hoped that the congestion problem was now approaching solution. The problem had been a big one. The pre-war figures for imports into North France had been 1,800,000 tons (1913). The present figures were 50,000,000 tons a year. The difficulty was evacuation. A large proportion of French rolling-stock was in the hands of the Germans; a large proportion devoted to the English armies ; but things were looking better now. England was sending a large number of waggons; a big order in America for new waggons was beginning to take effect; and a new system of unloading goods some way from the ports at depots was working well. More labour was being put on the railway^ and ports, and imports were being reduced in every direction. Compared with the situation at the Somme offensive the present was a great improve-ment. M. de Joly ended by making the point that the unloading of coal in the French ports compared favourably in speed to the loading of coal at Cardiff and ore in Spanish ports.THE FOURTH SEA LORD did not see much material for. discussion in what had so far been said. He wished to come to a concrete proposal. The Sub-Committee would, he hoped, produce a statement fbr each Ally of every free ship trading outside strictly Government service, showing where it is and what it is doing. The Admiralty already had such a statement, showing gross tonnage (above 1,600 tons), position, and commitment of each ship. His proposal was that a Standing Committee should be formed at once by the Allies to exchange and compare the information which such a statement would give. Would not such a Standing Committee, with reasonable powers, sitting, say, in London here, materially help to solve the shipping problem ?MR. ROYDEN put it that such a Committee might, for instance, have saved the waste of tonnage waiting at Philadelphia for wheat for Italy. To some extent the work of such a Standing Committee was already being done with regard to wheat. The point was that, if one owner controlled the combined merchant fleets of the Allies, he would get much more economical use out of it than the Allies were doing.MR. SALTER instanced bit of thoroughly useful co-operation the agreement with the Italians as to Italy taking some wheat from Australia, thereby materially shortening a very long journey.SIGNOR ANCONA was doubtful whether, even with the maximum of co-ordina-tion, the shipping available would prove enough.   If not, it must come to rationing.THE FOURTH SEA LORD defined this problem as that of priority/but returned to his proposal of a Standing Committee. Re.put it to the Allies that such a Committee must do good-at any rate, could do no harm.
COMMANDER VANDIER saw difficulties in. such a ton for ton policy.SIGNOR ANCONA admitted that such a Committee might be very useful, but confessed that to himself the lessening of consumption was the more essential problem. Only absolute essentials must be consumed. Could we not agree to eat much less ? The economic use of tonnage was to him a secondary consideration compared with this.THE FOURTH SEA LORD thought the Committee were agreed that non-essentials should&quot; he relentlessly cut down, and asked M. de Joly what he thought of the Standing Committee proposal.&apos;M. DE JOLY vvas not willing to give an opinion on this proposal without further discussion with his colleagues.&apos; /-:;;7-,vV/;:/:/,:&apos;-. &apos;   &apos;        &apos;PROFESSOR ATTOLICO repeated/ Signor Ancona&apos;s point. Even allowing for the; relief which more economic use of tonnage would provide, it was not thought; possible to transport even all essentials. Even essentials must be reduced, so that food rationing is immediately necessary.; The Italians are in favour of the proposed Committee, but the real remedy is rationing -the most drastic restriction of consumption.M DE JOLY quite agreed that all possible restriction of imports should take place; but the term &quot;-rationing&quot; was not, he thought, acceptable to France. That was a matter, of course, of: internal domestic policy. Incidentally rationing did not necessarily mean reduction of imports.THE FOURTH SEA LORD was indifferent to the term used, restriction or rationing. He understood M. de Joly would like;to consult his colleagues and give an answer to-morrow about the proposed Standing Committee.M. DE JOLY said that was his wish. He thought they were all agreed in principle, tie would like to know exactly what powers it was proposed the Committee should have.THE FOURTH SEA LORD made it clear that the Committee would not deal with questions of restriction, but with the economic management of the pooled shipping of all the Allies, seeing how each could help each, a co-ordinating Allied ShippingCommittee.. - &apos;;:-&apos; * * * .&apos;&quot;.-.COMMANDER VANDIER asked whether the Committee would have executivepowers. aTHE FOURTH SEA LORD replied that this was the intention. The Committee should have a certain amount of executive power.   It would clearing house orexchange.M. DE JOLY said he would give his opinion to-morrow.THE FOURTH SEA LORD wished to make sure out of hand that Signor Ancona agreed to the Committee.SIGNOR ANCONA, while professing his agreement, made it clear that he regarded the reduction/of essentials, wheat,&amp;c, as the real specific. He thought the Committee could make a definite recommendation as to this. A beginning had already been made, but the matter had not gone far enough. What he would Lke would be a common survey by the Allies of all requirements in relation to all the tonnage avail-able, and if (as would-be the Case) a deficit were found, the formation of a programme for cutting down essentials. The Allies should agree to and a,dopt a common method of reducing essentials ; for instance, rationing. -THE FOURTH SEA LORD directed that this recommendation should be noted for reference to the Conference. He asked M. de Joly if a. French -statement could be made out on the lines of.the Transports Statement as to free shipping.M. DE JOLY said that there would be no difficulty about that.   Referring to -Signor Ancona&apos;s proposal for a common programme of consumption reduction, he wished to remind the Committee of the diversity of national tastes and habits, and hoped that. any inter-Ally policy would bear that very mUch in mind.   He instanced the national attitude towards wine, coffee, and sweets.SIGN OR ANCONA was alive to this point. Each Ally must cut down according to his national tastes and habits, ton for ton; each choosing what he can best do without.      &quot; .
&apos; THE FOURTH SEA LORD put it that Question (2), Coal for France and Italy, had already been dealt with in M. deJolys and Signer Anconas remarks.r- M. .DE JOLY wished to cite certain figures which showed a very considerable and steady increase in the proportionate amount of coal exported by England to neutrals as compared with France and Italy. ; The figures: were taken from a private coalovvners return, and were read out by M. de Joly. .       -COMMANDER VANDIER, confirming this, expressed the hope that they would; result in.the addition of one-fifth to the total amount of coal carried per month from England to France without the addition of airy ships for this service.. Til 10 FOURTH SEA LORD added that, the suggestion; that coal should be railed down to Exmouth, Poole, and Teignmouth, was also being gone into, and he hoped it would prove possible.   (See attached note.)   -THE FOURTH SEA LORD suggested that as (3) (Boiling-Stock) affected France, and not Italy, so far as the Italians were concerned the discussion might now close for to-day, but SIGNOR ANCONA demurred to this, having himself a proposal to make as to rolling-stock on behalf of the Italians. But first he asked whether any answer could be given to the request for tonnage for carrying coal, made earlier in the afternoon.THE FOURTH SEA LORD replied that an immediate answer could not possibly be given to that question ; it would need long and; patient investigation; the Sub-Committee must go into it very closely, and he was afraid that it could not be properly answered for some days. In the meantime he would like to remind the Committee that England was desperately short of coal, even for the Navy.M. DE JOLY thought that; the rolling-stock position: in France was fairly satis-: facbory. England, by providing the rolling-stock now being, sent over, was doing all that could be expected; what was now wanted was tugs for the river transport.The session terminated with a promise that on the morrow the French delegates would produce statements (1) on the general transport situation : (2) on the congestion and coal questions. : y. ..y -;(The Committee adjourned until 11 am. Wednesday.)(Sir Guy Granet and General Mai ice a rriv ed just after th e Committee h ad broken up, and the working of the railways in France was briefly discussed with the Fourth . Sea Lord.   Sir Guy and General Mance undertook to come over next day if wanted.)Note on the French Coal Trade.A representative of the French coal trade: suggested that the sailing vessels and small steamers carrying approximately 200. to 400 tons should load their cargo at Portland, the coal being sent from Cardiff by rail. This suggestion is impossible, since the congestion at Portland, owing to munitions,. prohibits;auy further shipping at that port. It is, however, suggested that the small ports, such as ExmoUth,-Teignmouth, Poole, &amp;c, might be very well used for the export of coal to France. These ports are accustomed to deal with coal, and the&quot; railways run on to the coaling wharves. Sufficient water for these smaller vessels is always available. The Railway Executive Council have been approached, and although a definite decision was not given, it is understood from the Secretary that no difficultv would be anticipated of running as a routine at least two coal trains per diem, say 400 tons. This suggestion would improve the tonnage question, as the time in transit would be considerably reduced, and the use of sailing-vessels, owing to the comparatively short voyage, need not be entirely dispensed with/Over 100 of these small craft are employed in the trade, and it is thought would be able at least to carry 500,000 tons per annum.
Second Day.THE FOURTH SEA LORD opened the second days session by asking whether M. de Joly could -now give his conclusion as to the Standing Committee&apos;^proposal.M. DE JOLY said that he had consulted Admiral Lacaze and his.colleagues, and had their authority to say that1. As regards .restriction of imports the French were fully in accord with \ the -. - - Italians that all possible restrictions should be made, starting with articles of personal comfort.2. As regards the proposed Centra! Literally Shipping Bureau the French Delegates were equally in accord with the British. Their notion of what was wanted was a Bureau collecting and. exchanging all information as to the position of the merchant fleets of the Allies at the earliest possible .. moment, so that it might form a general opinion on the shipping position with full knowledge at. any moment; the form in which that knowledge should be set out being a matter of detail. But - they did not think the Bureau should have &quot; dictatorial&quot; powers. If the representatives of all three Allies were agreed on the expediency of this or that, then let it be done ; but if there were any disagreement then reference must be made to the Governments concerned.THE FOURTH SEA LORD said that the notion of the French Delegates appeared to coincide with the English proposal. He accordingly read out the following resolution as embodying the proposal to. which all the Allied Delegates seemed to agree :- -    - -.: : &quot; That an International Shipping&apos; Committee be appointed to obtain and exchange full and up-to-date information as to the employment of the mercantile -vessels under the control pf the various Allies, to ascertain whether, by co-operative programmes or otherwise, the transport of essential articles can be increased, and to make such consequent arrangements with the respective Govern-&apos;/&quot;-/&apos; ments as may appear desirable.&quot;This resolution was agreed to by the Delegates.PROFESSOR PARODI urged that while the Italians thought this resolution a good and useful one, it was not an immediate remedy for the present critical situation, and a very immediate remedy was what was wanted. It would be some time before the good effects of the labours of the new Committee would be felt; in the meantime will not England do what she can to relieve us in the very grave case we have put before the Committee.THE FOURTH SEA LORD wished it to be clear at once that the question of immediate relief had already gone forward, and was on its way to the Cabinet. The two questions of immediate relief to Italy and future use of Allied tonnage were quite separate. He understood, therefore, that the resolution he had just put to the Committee was unconditionally agreed to.He would now out a second resolution to them. viz. : &quot; That; it is ;bf paramount importance that the Government of each Allied country, with a view to assisting the transport of articles which are essential to the successful prosecution of the war, should take immediate steps to restrict to the utmost possible extent the importation of all other articles.&quot;SIGNOR ANCONA on this handed to the President a&apos;statement, which he said embodied the views of the Delegates from Italy, including Admiral Corsi, as to the steps necessary to any attempt at solving the shipping problem.The statement, Which was read out by the Fourth Sea Lord, was as follows :-&quot;Considering that, in consequence of the tonnage situation, some Allied countries are already experiencing the lack of raw material and other supplies ; ...   essential to the. prosecution of the war and to the existence of the populations :&quot; Considering that, any prolongation, of this state of things is bound, within a. ..  /      [300J &apos; M
brief period of time, to result in curtailing the powers of resistance of such Allies in relation to the war:&quot;Considering, further, that the agreed principle of community of resources and . &apos;     opportunities carries with it also equality of privations and sacrifices :&quot; It is agreed:  .&quot; (a.) That a general revision of the employment of every single unit of the entire Allied Merchant Fleet shall be made with the object of ascertaining whether and whence it is possible to divert further tonnage, to more essential y  requirements:*&apos; (6.) That as the result of such revision, a redistribution of the tonnage belonging to the Allies or controlled by them shall be proceeded with, in proportion with their respective needs, and in such manner as to ensure equal powers of resistance to all nations engaged in the war:&quot; (c.) That any eventual deficit existing between tonnage possibilities and the ascertained needs of the Allies shall be calculated; these needs being-classified on an equal basis of priority from the point of view of their relation to the war and to the sustenance and life of the people :&quot; (d.) That the&apos;Ministers responsible in all the Allied countries for the food of the people shall be asked to provide, by common accord: Firstly : For the complete elimination of all forms of consumption which are not strictly essential:Secondly: For the reduction also of essential requirements, if necessary by means of immediate rationing, within such limits as may be found necessary to cope with any deficit ascertained in the manner above indicated.THE FOURTH SEA LORD invited the views of M. de Joly on the Italian :&apos; resolutions.M. DE JOLY submitted that they were outside the scope of a Naval and Shipping Conference. The pooling of fleets and the rationing of populations were matters on which sUch a conference had no power to make recommendations. If fleets, why not finances, or man-power ? - - :THE FOURTH SEA LORD admitted the force of this contention. . He - hoped that Signor Ancona might be content with the more general resolution, which did not go into any details.SIGNOR ANCONA regretted that the Italian Delegates could put forward only the resolution jhst read by the President as substantive proposals for solving the problem presented in Agendum (1).THE FOURTH SEA LORD suggested that the general resolution might be referred to the Conference by the Committee-the Italians forwarding their proposals separately in the name of the Italian Delegates.M. DE JOLY agreed that this was the right procedure. &apos;GENERAL DALL&apos;OLIO here put it to the Committee, as a soldier, that after March, without the help asked for, the necessary reduction in the output of ammunition would prohibit.the offensive and paralyse even the defensive.THE FOURTH SEA LORD/supposed that the Italian Delegates did not think the general resolution as&apos; to the restrictions either strong enough or precise enough. Would they; put forward theirs separately ?     y -SIGNOR ANCONA much .preferred \ that the Italian resolutions should go forward in the name of the Committee, as adopted by them; but-THE FOURTH SEA LORD held that they were matter for discussion without prejudice by the Conference.M. DE JOLY agreed, adding that he wished it put on record that he did not think the Italian proposals within the scope and powers of the Conference, and that this view of his should be presented to the Conference when the Italian resolutions were put before them.THE FOURTH SEA LORD promised that this should be done, and surmised that the whole ground of the first three questions of the Agenda was covered by the two
resolutions, which-would-be submitted to the; Conference, probably the same afternoon. He then thanked the Delegates, and expressed ji hope that much good might come of the Conference. The Allies were now some way further towards understanding each -others troubles, and he felt sure that each would do what they could to help the others.(The Committee then dispersed.)THE FOURTH SEA LORD wished a note to be made that-1. The British representative on the International Shipping Committee should beappointed by the Shipping Controller. 2. The representatives must&quot; be practical persons with sufficient standing andweight to enable them to get all the information required, and to preventtheir recommendations being ignored. 3. The terms of reference and powers of the Committee should at once be preciselyformulated and communicated through the Foreign Office to the AlliedGovernments before the representatives were chosen.Remarks put forward by M. de Joly, Chief of the Maritime TransportDepartment.First Question. ,.Up to the date of August 1916 the requirements of France with regard to imports were almost satisfied. They were supplied by cargoes, of which the monthly returns in our ports amounted to 5,000,000 tons, which may be analysed as follows : -. Tons..Coal     ....    - - ..       .. : - y--- - . -&apos; .-,&quot;.. V - : .,:, v;,-- .. y, : --: ,2,000,000English Army . .   ...... y: , .. . .     ...  .700,000(will soon be 1,000,000).Cereals for civil and military supplies controlled by Government .. 600.000 Steel, other metals, ore, pyrites, and nitrites for the Ministry of Arms and;:-.yy Munitions: ...         -.     &apos;   .. . ^ , ... y . - . ^    .   ..       - ... 700,000 .. flaw material for engineering work (wood, barbed wire, &amp;c), railway material (rails, trucks, &amp;c), petrol, spirits, oily grains, cotton wool,sugars, &amp;c. .....               - ..         .-. --      .. 1,000.000y;V- .-- &apos;   Total &apos;     .... .. ...3,000,(100Is it practicable to restrict, these imports ? To a certain degree it is, although the great majority of them, even those included under the last heading, are essential to the existence of the country and to its defence. The consumption of coal has been reduced by suppressing much of the railway traffic, and; reducing the amount of artificial light employed both in public and in private. Restriction on the use of sugar will come into force on the 1st February. The measures taken to reduce the consumption of flour will be made more. severe. The Commission of Woods and Metals at the Ministry of Munitions has under its control all imports of building timber, and admits only what is necessary.All ,other possible measures of restriction will be undertaken, but it is to be expected that they will hardly counterbalance the loss of tonnage which we have to fear.The position with regard to coal in France has become acute since last October. The imports,, which amounted to 2,000,000 tons in July and August, dropped to 1.500,000 tons in November, and 1,40.0,000 tons in December. During the last four months the deficit stood at 1,400,000 tons.They population of Paris is suffering from cold ; . blast-furnaces are out, manufactories stopped, and the stocks in our ports are below those of the Italian ports. The P.L.M. Railway (Paris-Lyons-Marseilles) has only a .week&apos;s supply in hand.The supplies of cast iron and steel are also below the manufacturers&apos; requirements; there is some risk that the 155 mil lira, shell manufactory will be stopped within a fortnight; copper is on the point of failing, &amp;c.The Conference will assuredly not forget, on the other hand, what France has done for the Allies. I do no refer to the blood which has been shed, and which nothing -can replace, but am speaking from a material point of view.
We have the large array of Great Britain on our territory, and besides the burden, imposed on our ports by the transport&apos; of its provisions, our railways have to carry its troops and munitions; our country partly furnishes it with food, and also contributes largely to the munition supply of the Allied countries, Russia, Roumania and Serbia.The care of the army in Salonica weighs more heavily on France than on any other country. The fifth part of our available merchant fleet is requisitioned to serve as transports to the East. : By making twenty-nine requisitions in December 1916, to supplement those already on service, we have stopped communications with our colonies ; we are cut off from New Caledonia ; our civil and military supplies have been delayed-witness the imports of American steel which at this moment have accumulated in United States ports to the amount of 230,000 tons.This is our position, and it is a critical one. France is most ready to recognise the needs of her Allies, but she cannot but be aware of the immensity of the task undertaken by the country in which the enemy is making his greatest effort, and in this task she owes it to herself to succeed.Second Question.In the course of the year 1913-the&quot; last normal year---the French ports have unloaded 2,800,000 tons of goods per month. In 1916 the rate of unloading reached 5,000,000 tons, approximately per month during several consecutive months. It; has not been possible to arrive at such an increase without encountering difficulties at any rate of a temporary character; these have, however, generally been connected with the discharge, of the unloaded material towards the interior.In effect, experience has shown that we had more quays than tools, and more tools than means of transport.Except in the case of certain ports where inland waterways play an important part, this momentary congestion is chiefly due to lack of rolling-stock.This scarcity of rolling-stock has been apparent since the beginning of 1915, when traffic was resumed, and in places where the removal by the enemy of 55,000. carriages began to make itself felt. Great efforts were made, and in the course of the first months oI:&apos; 1916 the conditions at the ports were, generally speaking, satisfactory. Difficulties appeared again during last year, when the great transport arrangements necessitated by the Somme offensive, especially as regards the British Expeditionary Force, immobilised a great deal of the rolling-stock, and almost paralysed the lines of the Chemins de Fer du Nord, dislocating the traffic arrangements of such ports as Dunkerque.By now this congestion of the ports has come to an end as, unfortunately, supplies, have diminished, especially the supply of coal, ever since the month of October.; At Rouen, which accounts for a third of the import of coal, there are many empty (coal) depots, and only at Havre are th ere at present any vessels waiting, which is chiefly due to its importance as a British base.In spite of this undeniable amelioration, and although the. risk of the congestion of ports must continually decrease on account of the increase of means of transport and decrease of tonnage, the French Government has taken energetic measures to guard against fresh congestion. Stock has been developed, quays and piers have been built, and labour increased. As to the railwa)&apos; transport, this has been improved by the increase of disposable rolling-stock.Already the British Government has come to our assistance by deciding to send to France 20,000 railway trucks to make up, ro a certain extent, for the 25,000 French trucks handed over for the British transport.... These, new carriages have been ordered both in England and in several neutral countries, and already the rolling-stock built in the United States is arriving at the rate of 1,500 to 2,000 a month.::. Whatever may be the improvement in the arrangements of our ports, one must always reckon on sudden rushes of traffic, especially those due to the unexpectedness of the submarine war and the execution of measures, of safety determined on. by the Naval authorities: of the Allies, Also, it has been decided to make arrangements to a low both at the ports and in the neighbourhood of ports, of the warehousing of goods which it has not been possible to convey into the interior owing to circumstances.- These are the means taken by the French authorities, and they intend to continue their efforts unceasingly.- In the above observations mention has been; specially made of the French ports which relj only on railways or principally rely on /railways.   Havre and Rouen, which
have not only to deal with the needs of two important British bases and the provisioning-of the district of Paris, but also of the eastern provinces now separated from their natural source, of supplies make great demands on the Seine waterways for the conveyance of the material, unloaded there.For this reason, and since, the British Government has exerted itself to come, to the aid of our railway transport, it would be advisable also to assist our river transport, which the authorities of the United Kingdom could do by allowing France suitable river vessels for the navigation between Havre, Rouen, and Paris.report op shipbuilding committee.At a Conference held in the Third Sea Lord&apos;s Room on the 24th January, the Third Sea Lord presided, and th e folio wing we re present: Engineer Ziegel &quot;1Engineer Boris  \ French. :M. Godin JCommander Baistrocchi, Italian.Director of Naval Construction.Deputy Engineer-in-Chief.Mr. Rogers, representing S.C.W.1. Commander Baistrocchi handed in the enclosed note &quot; A,&quot; and explained that the 40,000 tons of steel which was being supplied to-the&apos; Italian Government, as arranged at the Pallance Conference, was allocated.to the construction of vessels for the Merchant Marine. It was absolutely necessary to obtain from England the further amount of 1,500 tons of steel per month, this being required by the Italian Navy for work on torpedo-boat destroyers and for repairs,  y- 2. The Third Sea Lord stated that eveiy effort would be made to supply these iucreased requirements over those which were already being arranged for, but in the present stringency of raw material, and the great demand on the rolling mills of the country for the Allied armies and navies, it was impossible to guarantee that the amount can be supplied until the position has again been thoroughly gone into by the Minister of Munitions.  .The Italian Delegate then withdrew. -3, Engineer Zeig el read and handed in the enclosed Memoranda (B) and (C). The French requirements had been divided under two heads :- - &apos; (a.) First Emergency.(I.) Steel material amounting to a total of 41,000 tons. (2.) Motors or engines for 50 motor-barges, 100 river tugs, 50 trawlers.The above requirements would be reduced if vessels already built could be supplied,(b.) Second Emergency. Steel material amounting to a total of 39,000 tons.The steel for the first emergency should be delivered and shipped before July, and.that for the second emergency during the six months following, i.e., an average of 8,000 tons per month until the end of June, and of 6,000 tons per month subsequently. The supply of labour would be sufficient to make adequate use of this material, and the French authorities were hoping to receive assistance from the Italians in this respect.4. The Third Sea Lord made reference to the great stringency in the available supply of steel, and the very large demands made on it by the armies and navies of the Allied nations, and promised that every effort should be made to meet the French [300] &apos; N
requirements. It was pointed out that at the present time much steel was being produced in Great Britain for the French Army j 10,000-12,000 tons of shell steel as well as large quantities of corrugated plates for the French Trench Warfare Depart-ment for use next winter. In regard to the shell steel, large quantities were being-held back in England at the present time on account of lack of tonnage and unloading facilities. The Third Sea Lord stated that, in view of these accumulations, it seemed possible that the Ministry of Munitions might reduce temporarily the work on shell steel, so as to meet the steel requirements of the French Navy, and stated that this would be considered in conjunction with the Ministry of Munitions. If the French steel could stand aside temporarily, the French naval demands could be met, but other-wise it would be a matter of very great difficulty.5. The French Delegates reported that there were in France launched and in an advanced stage of construction and with engines practically complete thirteen merchant vessels (see enclosed list (D)), but that these ships could not be completed on account of about 2,000 tons of steel still being required. The Third Sea Lord promised that arrange-ments would be made for the immediate supply of the outstanding material as soon as the detailed requirements were received from the Commission inter nation ale de llavitaillement. .  &apos;6. To facilitate supplies of steel material it was agreed that :-(a.) Qualities demanded should be reduced to two only, viz., boiler plate and constructional.(b.) The nearest British dimensions would be accepted instead of metric standards.7. In regard to the supply of engines included in (2) of first emergency, the Third Sea Lord pointed out that engines of the size required were very difficult to get at the present time without interfering with other important services. The Admiralty has quite recently been endeavouring to place further orders for vessels of the same type, but without success, on account of great pressure in the shipyards and engineering shops of this country. This rendered it impossible to place any orders for the French with any prospect of early delivery, and it would therefore be necessary to consider, as the trawlers now under construction in this country were completed, in which Navy they would be performing the greatest service to the Allied cause, and, if necessary, allocate some to the French Navy. The Third Sea Lord undertook to raise the question whether any of the &quot;X&quot; lighters could be lent for temporary use at Brest..- 8. It was pointed out that Messrs. Ruston, Proctor, of Lincoln, might be able to undertake some of the motors for the lighters, and Messrs. Sissons, of Gloucester, engines for one or two tugs. As the French were already in treaty for the supply of internal-combustion engines from various firms in the country, it was arranged that priority should be given to such work/ They were also informed that the attention of the Admiralty had recently been drawn to the fact that small engines were available in America, and it was suggested that, as the Admiralty did not wish to purchase any of these, the field was therefore left free for the French to investigate.(A.)-Fourth Question.Our shipyards are engaged nearly to the limit of their capacity on extremely urgent shipbuilding for the Royal Navy, but it is absolutely necessary to obtain from England monthly 1,500 tons of steel (for shipbuilding, machine engines, and boilers).The number of the employes in the shipyards has been reduced in consequence of many of them being now employed on munitions, &amp;c, for the Army. Nevertheless, a consortium has been formed for the building a certain number of steamers (fourteen in this year and thirteen in the next year), making use of the material yet assigned on the occasion of the &quot; Pallance Conference.&quot;It is not&apos;possible for our shipyards to provide for the building of any class of escort vessels or of patrol boats.ALFRED BAISTROCCHI, Capitaine di Frigate.
(B.) Present Position of French Shipbuilding.We have in France six Government dockyards (Bizerte included) and sixteen private shipyards, distributed as follows : Government Dockyards.Cherbourg. Brest. Lorient. Bochefort. Toulon.

We consider it impossible to reduce the number of men used for that last purpose.Tools.All these shipbuilding yards are well provided and equipped in machine tools of every description, but, roughly speaking, every machine tool which has been judged able to work for war material (shell, guns, carriage-, &amp;c.), has been turned over for that, and consequently the building of engines for instance is almost impossible.On the other hand, the real shipbuilding tools (punching, shearing, piercing machines, &amp;c), are partially idle on account of the lack of labour to work them.Ships at present being built.10 patrol ships in Government dockyards. 22 patrol ships in private shipyards.[300]    : O
13 merchant-ships.in private shipyards which could be completed in 1917, providedsome material would be delivered in time. 10 merchant-ships in private shipyards which could be completed in 1918, provideda lot of material would be delivered in time.: -.\    Our Programme.1. We want urgently to complete in a few months the thirty-two patrol ships indicated above, and at least the thirteen merchant ships which are able to be completed this year.- 2. We want almost immediately : 50 motor barges of 150 tons deadweight for the service of Russian shipments fromArchangel.   And in the next six months. 100 river tugs from 300 to 500 I.H.P., and 150 river barges loading about 500 tonsfor the river transport to relieve congestion at the ports. 50 trawlers for patrol of 30 to 40 metres long.This is our minimum programme, not taking into account the urgent need of new tonnage of our merchant navy.Of course, the building of our battleships and submarines is entirely stopped.What we want for the realisation of that Programme.First of all, steel material, which is roughly specified on the attached statement. Of course, any facilities which could be given to us as regards ships or barges ready made would reduce our requirements of raw material. .About 4,000 skilled workmen for shipbuilding, which we would more specially require from our Italian Allies.:Motors or engines ready built for the 50 motor-barges (50 I.H.P.), the 100 river tugs (300 to 500 I.H.P.), and the 50 trawlers (300 to 500 I.H.P.), subject to the same restriction as above in case we should be supplied with some ready-made tugs or barges.&apos;Considering the enormous burden which is supported by our country in this great war, we think that the above requirements are indeed very moderate, and we in a friendly spirit urge our Allies to give us the relatively small assistance which we require.ZIEGEL, Ingenieur de la Marine.January 24, 1917.(C).

The War Cabinet took note of the arrangements made by the Prime Minister with the representatives of the Italian Government on the 26th January, 1917, for the provisionof coal to Italy (Appendix I).Appendix I.Coal for Italy.Note of the Conference held at .10, Downing Street, on January 26, 1917, between the Prime Minister and Uepresentatives of the Italian Government.The Prime Minister, accompanied by the Shipping Controller, saw the Italian Ambassador, Admiral Corsi, Italian Minister of Marine; General Dall&apos;Olio, Italian Minister of Munitions; Signor Ancona, Under-Secretary, Italian Ministry of Transport; and Professor Attolico, Commission internationale de Ravi taillement, this evening, to further discuss the Italian requirements of tonnage.THE PRIME MINISTER assured the Italian Ministers that the British Govern-ment was most anxious to assist Italy to obtain additional tonnage for coal, of whichSecond Emergency.10.000 tons (plates^ angles, and sections) required for the building of several patrol-ships to complete our programme, and which will be built immediately after thepresent ones  ..         ..&apos;       ......         .:.         ..         .. 10,0009,000 tons (plates, angles, and sections) ordered by the private shipyards for completionof ships during 1918    ....         ........        -.. 9,00020,000 tons (plates, only) for the stocks of Government dockyards for keeping up andrepairs of the fleet during the last months of 1917 ....         .. 20,000: Total of the Second Emergency       ...        -.. .. ..   39,000The First Emergency should be delivered and shipped before July 1917, and the second one during the last six months, that is to say, an average of 8.000 tons per month till end of June, and 6,000 tons per month after end of June.
she was in so great need; but, unfortunately, there was very little British tonnage available.: He understood that the Italian Government could themselves furnish 500,000 tons per month out of the 800,000 tons which was required, leaving a balance of 300,000 tons to be provided for; the British Government would do their best to help in making up this balance. He hoped that a portion would be supplied by neutral vessels. Under a recent allocation of neutral tonnage by the newly-established Inter-Ally Chartering. Committee, France had been given half of the neutral tonnage avail-able, and the other half had gone to Italy, England haying renounced her share in favour of the Italian Government,He was of the opinion that France was getting more than her share ; in fact, her tonnage position at the present moment is better than British, and in these cireum-stances he was going to propose to the French Government that they should give up 100,000 tons of the British tonnage at present in her employ. He had approached the Admiralty, and had asked them to find 125,000 tons during next month, but he drew the attention of the Italian Ministers to the fact that in so doing we were running grave risks, since not only this country, but also France and Italy were dependent on the British fleet for the mastery of the seas.He felt confident, therefore, that it would be possible to make Up the balance of 300,000 tons for February as follows :--   Tons.Prom the British Admiralty ..      &quot;... .. .. ..     125,000To be withdrawn from French service        .. .. .. ..     100,000Neutral tonnage .. .. .. .. 75,000Total     .... .....    300,000.;:;:: The Prime Minister referred to the question of sending coal by rail across France to Italy, and although it might only be possible to send a very small quantity, yet it would relieve the situation. It was agreed that this question should be carefully considered, with a view to seeing what could be done.. GENERAL DALL&apos;OLIO asked whether it would be possible to supply an additional quantity of coal this month. -It was explained to him by the Prime Minister that this would be quite impossible.SIGNOR ANCONA said that, in these circumstances, he would be obliged to ask the Minister of Marine to let him have 100,000 tons immediately from the Naval Reserve.MR. LLOYD GEORGE pointed out in reply that the British Government-had already been obliged to take this step and draw upon the Admiralty Strategical Reserve in order to supply Italy with additional coal, and that, owing to this action, the Admiralty were short of their requirements last month by 70,000 tons.SIGNOR ANCONA asked whether any information was forthcoming with regard to the amount of British tonnage that would be allocated to Italy for the carriage of wheat, and was informed in reply that this matter would be discussed with the Wheat Executive and Admiralty officials concerned.THE ITALIAN AMBASSADOR, in thanking the Prime Minister for the assistance which he had promised to the Italian Government, stated that the Italian Ministers were also most grateful for the way in which their request had been met.printed at the foreign office bt c. r. harijison.-22/2/1.01.7.
