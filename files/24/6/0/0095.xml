.&apos; From Viceroy, 1st March 1917.I:; Private and personal.   Sykes.   In my private telegram of 28th FebruaryI did not refer to financial aspects of the case as I was anxious to avoid creating impression that question of expense had weighed with ns. But I feel it right to let you know that Sykes,: who objects to most rudimentary audit, is conducting his operations at enormous cost, without, so far as I can see, commensurate results. He Avas given a free hand with result that the cost of his expedition up to April next will amount to about G00,000L, and his estimate for next year is 1,000,0001.He has so far raised or rather taken over 4,800 men of very doubtfulI value. -
