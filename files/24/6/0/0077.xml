(Report &quot;by -Ir H.Bc^ington Smith - see Tfor Cabinet 77, Min.13)&apos;   1, Uhe number of Horses and mules omployed &quot;by the. Army&apos; (January 31, 1917) and the amount of grain required for; them are as follows:-       &apos;&quot;Horses :;I.fdlos &quot;   ffumftqr Tons of Oats&quot;     T;&apos; : &quot;&quot; (or other grain per month)United Kingdom 148,000 &apos;      - 25,000Erande 419,000 01,000.567,000 106,000Salonioa 106,000: 18,000Egypt 59,000 . 16,000Mesopotamia  - .   77,000 12,00.0.        &apos;-    &apos;  42,000 46,0.00Total:: 809,000 152,000or    1,824,000 tons&quot;per annum.The weight of grain required for military; horses in the United Kingdom and -France alone would supply a population of 14,000,000 with wheat on the Food Controller&apos; s scale. The horses in Salonica, Egypt: and Hesopotamia; are now being supplied with grain from India:- barley, grain, etc., &quot;being substituted for oats.     The oats for France are imported direct from America.     The horses in Prance require also 70,000 tons of hay per month, (840,000 tons per annum).     This is bought in the United ringdom,: and shipped to Prance.2. Uorth America is the largest source of supply for horses and mules, the numbers imported in 1916 from IT, America and Australasia &quot;being as follows :rHorses and Whiles, -1916&apos;. From U.3.A. b Canada to&quot;United:--Kingdom.:        75;660 &quot;      &quot; &quot; Egypt        &quot; 21,866&quot;      &quot;   .    :    &quot;        V Salonica 28,141: -  125,66fit   ALustralia and New Zeala-ncl to Egypt 96,000In addition   - 3,000 horses per month were bought in the United kingdom:r this being-in the opinion of the Director of Remounts the largest number that\.o*m be obtained by voluntary purchase.The; post of the American: animal landed in England Is 10 r 25;^ higher then the maximum&apos;-prioe paid in the united ^ingdpm.3. The number of horses; in the United liingdom is not known, even approximately.The horses on agricultural holdings in 1916 numberedabout 2,100,000.     The other horsos T.fo probably more numerous. They were estimated in 1905 to amount to 4r500,000;   but the number has no doubt, decreased since then.
It is estimated that each horse consumes on the average 1¼ to 1½ tons of grain per annum (7½to 9-lbs per diem) the military rating being 13-lbs. If the total number of horses does not exceed 4,000,000 this would give a grain consumption of 5-6,000,000 tons per annum.

4. The questions which require special consideration appear to be :-

(a) reduction in the number of horses in civil use, by combined deliveries, reduction of pleasure horses, &amp;c.

(b) increased purchased of military horses in the United Kingdom, by absorption of horses set free under (a) or in consequence of the reduction of industries such as brewing; by raised price; or by requisition.

(c) reduction in the number of military horses.

This question has recently been before the War Cabinet. It can only be dealt with effectively by the Military authorities, under instruction from the War Cabinet.

(d) the possibility of rationing horses and prohibiting the use of grain for pleasure horses.

(e) the possibility, in the last resort, of extending the use of horse-meat, thus economising imports both of meat and of grain.

(f) A census of horses.

A census as required in order to deal fully with several of the above questions. The census could probably best be taken, under the Registrar General, by the police in country districts and by the local authorities, with the assistance of the police in the Boroughs. The methods to be adopted in Scotland and Ireland will require consideration. 

5. The Departments chiefly affected are :-

War Office,

Ministry of Food,

Ministry of Agriculture,

Local Government Board,

Board of Trade.

A Committee of representatives of these departments appears to offer the most convenient means of dealing with these questions. The committee should call in representatives of the departments concerned in Scotland and Ireland so far as necessary; and should confer with the Registrar General as to the Census.
