I am anvious to support the views put forward by Mr, Kond-..rson at the Cabinet in regard to the report of the Speaker - s Conferonce.   I:put my views in detail before the Cabinet in my memorandum of February 2nd, and I only propose now todeal with the .objectiens which were [raised, at the timcr to - which,I. have: referred; : They appear to me to be confined to two main points.   1st Women&apos; : Suffrage, 2nd the omission of Ireland,     I think that; both: u&apos; those objections- can be satis-f act or i ly me t YAs regards the first, I have had an interesting^-interview with Mrs-* Fawcett, who assured me that she was in a position to 3poak for something like twenty-two Women Suffrage Soc ie ties, . and told -mo that if;-the; Govornment would accept tho main recommendations of the Speakerf-s Conference, and put them into a bill to.bo presented to Parliament, she and those whom she reprcsontod would be. prepared :to accept -. the recommendation in regard to Women1s,:Suffrage as a reasonable, compromise.   This is very importantand as the concessions are limited,.I cannot help thinking that they ought to be similarly.accepted by those, who,.like myself.,, are strongly opposed to Women&apos;s Suffrage,, and I believe from-all I h aye heard, - that - the sense of Parliament and of the country.; would be in this direction.A&amp; regards Ireland, the difficulty is really I think owing to a want of explanation by - the Conferonee of -the reasons which led them to come to tho conclusion indi-catod in -the paragraph which deals with Ireland.   The Home Rule Bill is on the Statute Book.- --- No Nationalists can be expected to accept conclusions which would- indicate, any change of opinion on his part^oryany.doubt as to the ultimate issue.If the Home Rule Act^ef 1914 comes into operation in its prescut form, the Jg^prcsentation of Ire1and Is dealt with . and the members of^the House of Commons arc materially reduced.   IfItho Homo Rule Act does not come into operation in its present form, or if its conditions are varied, then it would be necessary to deal.with Ireland by an amending Bill which would embody such alterations as would be -consistent with: the new proposals, and it certainly would not be difficult to frame a clause which, would give expression to-these views.     Th;; real obstacle to the passing of- the Bill Is the action of the political agents and their supporters.   They profess to sec great injury to tho various parties;which they represent.   In my opinion it is essential that the Gov..rnnont, if it Is to prove itself strong, must disregard;the vieWs &apos;;bf the&quot;agents, insi st. upon their acceptance of their policy and not be deterred from proceeding with the&apos; Bill because of the opposition offered by those who, af tor all, arc!paid servants, and ought not therefore to be  . the masters of the various parties they represent.MEMORANDUM by: Mr,^Walter Long regarding the Report of the Speakers - Conference):J
The only other serious difficulty is the procedure. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs takes up an impregnable position when he indicates that it would be impossible for the Cabinet to discuss various points as they arise and decide what is to be the attitude of th Government towards them, and he is equally right when he points out that members of the Government, heavily burdened as they are with departmental work, could by no possibility be in regular attendance during the divisions.   But I am quite unable to agree with his suggestion that for those reasons the Bill should  not be in charge of a member of the Government.  The procedure I venture, to recommend is as follows:  that the Government should give notice of their intention to bring in a Bill ? the main recommendations of the Conference that they should intimate that they intend to do their best to pass it into law: that they appeal to the house in the special circumstances of the case to support them in this determination: and that they should appeal to their supporters, not to be reckoned by one side of the House alone, to do their best to carry the Bill with as little delay as may be consistent with adequate consideration of its proposals.  I believe that if an appeal of this kind, were made to Parliament and the country, it would meet with a very general response. I have myself received assurances from party men of the most extreme kind that they would be prepared to acquiesce in a policy such as I have described. 

There only remains one serious objection to be made. Lord ? that this Parliament is too old to be entitled to make so radical a change  in our Constitution. This, I think, loses its force when we realise that it is extremely improbable that an election would result in  any material change in the constitution of the House of Commons, in all probability all that happen would be that the cranks and pacifists in Great Britain would lose their seats, and there might be possibly some alteration in Irish representation owing to the growth of the Sinn Fein party.   But those changes would in no way indicate that the House of Commons, is not

representative of the country.   I believe that an opportunity presents itself which may never recur,to deal with the various questions covered by the speaker&apos;s conference ? spirit of conciliation and compromise, and that we shall be able if we proceed with courage and determination to secure a parliament really representative of the country, and therefore ready to consider and deal with the great Imperial problems which must present themselves immediately the war is over.  Surely it is inconceivable that we  should contemplate spending a year ? even two in a bitter partizan fight over these m.st controversial questions when we have the opportunity to deal with them on moderate lines, and to secure their settlement, for at all events, a considerable period of time

I venture to suggest that the Local Government. Board must linked with the Home Office, as the greater part of the work connected with the preparation and passage of the Bill will have to be done there.

I venture further,to make a somewhat novel suggestion, namely that the Prime Minister should invite the Leader of the Opposition, and the Loader of the Labour Party, Ireland not being concerned, to let their names be put on the back of the Bill. This, I believe,  would have a very remarkable effect in the House of Commons.
