B J3 E     T    ;G T. SI.    -IHGREASEp HOME PRODUCTIO?? OF IEOH ORE(Memorandum by the Ministry of Munitions and a note by Sir: Stcphenscn Sent - of the labour Supply Department, Ministry of Munitions.) .2SL 1FIMB MINISTERI have further discussed the- iron-ore proposals in ;jrsat detail and have a number of: Tables vrhich can be :furnished., if you wish,It is estimated that wen can produce in Cumberland and Lancashire an addiiional: 400,000 tons of high grade ore per annum by obtaining: the service of 2,000. skilled miners. In the Cleveland district, wo can produce an additional 2,000f000 tons a year of low-^Tado ore.     This will require the labour of about a further 4,000 skilled miners.In addition, there are a large number of districts which have boon carefully surveyed in Yorkshire,; $forth Lincolnshire and thereabouts which, with the provision of additional machinery, plant, etc; and, say, 500 men, can produce an additional 20,000 tons of low-grade ore per week.There are also a number of districts similarly requiring: more machinery, plant, otc in the Midlands. Northamptonshire, Rutland, Stafford and neighbouring counties, which can give an additional 30,000 tons of low-grade ore by the provision of an extra 2,500 men. -Knowing that we must allow a liberal disccunt for inexpert labour, difficulties of machinery, difficulties in obtaining labour etc., difficulties in transport (which are very great and which will require the; most determined efforts. to overcome), I estimate that wo may look to these various schemes, by the provision of from 10,000 to 12,CIO men, (of whom.5,000 must be expert miners and the remain! r able-bodied lab our e i&quot; .), to produce in, say, six months from now-at the rate of an additional 400,000 tons of high-grade ore and an additional 4,000,000 tons of low-grade ore per annum. We should, of course, before that time be gradually coming . up to this rate of production.You must   however, bear in mind that the low-grade ore will not release an equivalent tonnage of foreign high-grade ore nor make the same quality of iron.    We can put it approximately at 2 to 1, so that the whole effect would be equivalent to about 2,400,000 tons of high-grade ore which ; represents approximately  00,000 tons a month or equivalent to a third of our last year1s imports of ore.I should also tell you that the greatly increased .uso of low-grad e oros of whieh is classed as. the hasic type will mean a profound alteration in the methods of manufacture on an extensive scale.     It will mean the provision of additional blast-furnaces and converters.     Further, tho output.from; the furnaces with low-grado ore is materially less than that of furnaces usin  higher-grade ore;   but we have  -to face up to these difficulties.   &quot;We propose to begin with/the .
the Cumberland and Cleveland districts representing an increased output of over  ,000,000 tons of ore.     The whole thing represents a very big proposition, but I think/ that,, by the end of six months; the promise &quot;herein:made can be realised, provided the labour is forthcoming.I should also add that tho estimates which Watson provided^ covered- the / estimated: ore :requirements...for. the present year, and that the reduction of imports of for-eign- ore at which I am aiming . is; a /reduction on . the.. estimates which have formed., the basis . of Watson1 s . calculation. ?&apos;       &apos;  (Sgd)   C. Addison..22.2,17.Mote by Sir Stephens on Kent of the labour Supply Department-.-,THE MINISTER..With reference to the;Memorandum you read to us this morning, which you propose to address to the Prime Minister, I venture to submit that the labour; demand you set cut will prove insufficient for the following reasons.   This very largely: increased production of iron ore will I assume necessitate either an increase in steel works or in any case the propermanning:of the steel, extensions that are already . contemplated.:    In the latter case this labour is not provided nor in sight.     There will be required a further considerable number of men for ganister and limestone, quarrying, silica; and firebricks, the erection of &quot;blast furnaces, etc. and for the. steel works when: in operation.To -work out the number of men required for a programme of nthis description must take some very considerable&quot;... time      I would suggest that in. your Memorandum to the Prime Minister. you make: it a condition - that; the men of the types, suitable for the occupations;P have mentioned above be vreloased : from-the vColours;.;; in the firsi: place from tho Home :Porces and should that prove insufficient, in spvae short period from over-seas.     I am convinced-that if you wish, production, of iron ore and manufactured steelin some reasonable period;. it is essential that we get workmen who ere accustomed to such emoloymsnt..:    At the present moment tho only reinforcement of labour that we can look forward to is useless for any such work;    it will consist of 3 (iii) and C(iii) men who will be:quite incapable of undertaking work: of any/ arduous or hot nature. &apos; &apos;(Sgd) STEPHEIJSOK ZE.:iT.
