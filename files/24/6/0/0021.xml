SECRET G.T.  -21&apos; &quot; : WAR CABINETPUBLICATION CE IRISH COURTS-MARTIAL.- (Note &quot;by Lord Derby)PLEDGES.:On the 18th May 1916 MrV&amp;innell;asked a Question of Mr.Tennant as to when all the records of the Dublin Courts-Martial would, he laid upon the table and the reply was that it was not intended to lay theproceedings of the Courts-Martial on the table .   ::Next, a question on the same subject was asked by Mr.Dillom on the /1st June 1915,: and the Prime Minister re-plied and ga^re the qualified pledge that;the reports would &amp; be published in due course unless for some special reason   J&quot; in particular cases publication was undesirable.On the  6th June;Mr.Byrne asked Mr. Tennant when the reports of the Courts-Martial upon prisoners who had been sentenced to various terms of imprisonment ranging from six months to life sentences, would be published, and Mr.Tennant referred him - to ihe answer of the Prime Minister of the 1st June.It will be noted that the question cf Mr,Byrne is not quite the same as the question asked by Mr-Dillon. Mr.Byrners question referred;only to the reports of the proceedings of the Courts-Maitial of&apos;men who are alive.-Mr,.Byrne repeated his previous question which referred only to prisoners who were alive and the Prime Minister1s answer was that he had already promised that these reports stfould be published in due course.On. the 24th October Llr.Dillon again asked the Prime Minister when the proceedings of the Iiish Courts-Martial would be published and the Prime Minister replied that he would arrange for this to be dene..On &quot;the 16th November. Mr)Byrne, asked his previous question referring only to:prisoners who were alive and Mr.Porster. answered-that arrangements were being made to give effect to the: pledge of the Prime Minister&quot;of the 24th.On ;the 20th December 1916 (New Government) Mr.Dillon repeated.his former question and Mr Lunar Law answered that he was making enquiries into the oase.,On the 21st December 1916 Mr.Cinnell asked why the reports of.the proceedings of. the Courts-Martial held in Dublin last May had not yet been presented to the Bouse and Mr .Eealy asked a similar question,MrwM&amp;cpherson replied\that*&apos;&apos;&apos;the whole: question, involved--.a question of policy and would have to be:considered by the new Government.
IN CAMERA.This is a very difficult question.     The Law Officers of the Crown have been consulted and they are of opinion that there was no legal justification for holding these cases in camera.     The late Prime Minieter&quot;in the Reuse of Commons stated that, he thought that those cases were held in camera, not under the Army Act but under, the Defence of the Realm Act.     As I understand it, the Law Officers take the view that even under this Act it was not legal to hold any Court-Martial in camera.But it is well to remind ourselves of the conditions which obtained in Ireland at this time.     Martial Law was proclaimed, cn April 26th.     And it is significant.to note what the Adjutant-General says in a minute which was submitted to the Law Officers of the Crown;- .&quot;I spoke tc Sir John Maxwell on the subject and he is very strongly of opinion that publication would be h       not only a grave indiscretion but also a distinct breach cf faith with those who took the decision that the Ccurts-Martial were to be held ?.n^csc^:?;,     As I have before V observed, publication is, in my opinion/ a complete admission that there was no justification for the trial in camera (which in itself i s a ^rave reflection upon the discretion of Sir John. Maxwc! I). arc. as I have reason to believe that in &quot;certain cases the evidence was not too s strong, the inevitable resultz of publication would be that a certain section ci&quot;. the irirh. cci&amp;munity will urge that the sole reason for tr;*al in camera was that the Authorities intended to execute&apos;&apos; certa?.n&quot; of the Sinn Eeiners, whether there V-c..S evidence against them or not.&quot;Besides this there is the other fact that witnesses came forward and gave evidence cn the distinct understanding that their evidence was given ^nj^ameie. and that they them-selves could not be &quot;identified in the&quot; future and so lay them-selves open to any dangers of life or limb which the giving of the r evidence might enthil,PUBiilCATIOIT UPPER THE ARMY ACT&apos;.Section 124 of the Army Act which more particularly deals with the publication of the proceedings against any accused person at a Court-Marrial, will appear tc be quite clear The Lav/ Officers say:-,&quot;We are of opinion that the only person who, under Section 124 of the Army Act,  is entitled to obtain a copy of the pro deedings&apos;j  is the person tried./and they go on to say that&quot;Subject to the pictis:ens of the said Section we think that the proceedings are privileged documents and that production can be refused on the ground that it would be contrary tc the public interest.   Whether copies of the proceedings shall be supplied (otherwise than under the said.Section)v and to whom, and. whether any and what portions shall be published, /appear to us to be entirely.quest ions of policyIfhowever,.copies are supplied. we are. not aware of any penalty which persons r ec ei ving-;:them would- incur- &quot;by.-... publi cat ion.11 -
In. view or the opinion of &apos;the law Officers as stated . above, that the only person under Section 124 of the Ar-y Act who-,is, entitled to a copy of the proceedings iu the persontried, it would appear (a) /that if the/accused - person is;-dead -no copy :can be...supplied, and&apos; that (b). if copies : of the pro-oeedings against persons who arefalive: are suppliedthey; can    :.-w, be supplied only to the person-accused, and probably his rep-: .w resentative, or they can be supplied, to other parties, say the: House of Commons, if policy demands it.&apos;POLICY;.It is&apos; difficult to ae;-.ine here. ..hat policy connotes.&apos; It may mean; whether it is in the. public interest that the new Government,; should, fulfil the pledges that. mayor may not, hiwve been :-given by. its predecessor.     In this ^connection: it i/ill benoted that both.Mr.Eonar.Law and lIr,Maevhorsen, in reply &apos;to: the - questions put fo them about -1lie . pub 1 i cation of these reports, gave no pledge, .-m;d that Mr Jvlacjuiersoii went so far as to say that the question of publication was a Question of policy ..nd would have to be considered by the .: new Government, Or again, it&apos; might be u. question of policy as the Adjutant- -General points out, .lieth:.r we shoula satisfy wh^ desires of one or two mem.bers of the nationalist Party &quot;-ho have c*eLed        .;. / questions on this point, having noted that most of the questions ashed referred to the publication of the proceedings of the   -Courts-Mar tial on men who are now rlive.   &quot;nether . these consider- w. at ions weigh against the facts that these Courts-Martial were held . at a very critical period, ;;hen.Ireland was in a state of rebellion, when Sir John Iviarm/oll h-.-ld. these. Courts in ull good faith that secrecy would be respectedwhen the witnesses came forward secure in that faith, is a question for the vfar Committee to decMe. -        it would appear that legally, even though rightly or i-ronglyj the Courts were held in..camejja., each accused person - ho is alive is entitled to a ecoy of the xrroceedings if he nets for them, I am strongly bf opinion thmb it&apos;iswWgainst. the Law. , and against public policy, that the proceedings in the c_.ses of those vdio have, been executed should be published.I have res/1 the proceedings - In each of the latter cases very&apos; carefully ;and while I can -safely bay thwt  :ne evidence, ti-ken as a .-hole, is cor.elusive of their guilt, there ;.re cue or  v two - cases in&apos;which evidence is extre. ely thin.   For do I think it : onld be - wise if, for.exdi.pIe   e   ere to publish the evidence in the case, of - Edmund.
