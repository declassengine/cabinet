SECRET.ADDITIONAL   MILITARY   ASSISTANCEFROM  INDIA.INDIA OFFICE,February 1917.MS 365&apos;    : / . &apos;
oOMinute by the Military Secretary, India Office.&apos;  On the 10th November the Army Council asked us to raise additional Vide (1). . Indian forces, with a view to increasing man power overseas.- On the 13th November we telegraphed to India asking for their views, :and following up with various suggestions.   On the 30th November the ride (5). A7iceroy telegraphed his reply, the gist of which was that India could supply    : 12 Territorial  battalions  and also  send Indian troops  to relieve the 33th Division in Mesopotamia,   These measures would necessitate :  .-.V (1) The despatch of six Garrison battalions to India. (2) The raising of 10 Indian battalions. (3) The enrolment of six battalions of Volunteers.. To do this, however, various conditions were laid down, of which the most important were the supply of rifles and the release of British officers now in War Office employ. This telegram was forwarded to the War Office, who replied on. the 12th December demonstrating their inability to comply Vide (9).- in full..&apos;-, v;,.      &apos;. -:; -V.;; -\v.y-        -- ... On the 19th Deceinber a telegram to India oil the subject was approved Vide (11). in Council, and on the 22nd we warned the War Office that without their Vide (12). assistance in these matters the; whole project might break down.On. the 29th December we received a further telegram on the subject &apos;- (No.. 15306) which is now submitted.   From this it appears(1). That Territorial battalions can only be released as Garrison battalionsV/ arrive. :-&apos;-.z   r^yy^yy-y.(2) That drafts for British units in the Field Army must continue to be-sent on the scale of 8 per cent, per mensem.      -&apos;y:&apos; &apos;.&apos;v:&apos;. (3) That at least 40,000 rides must be sent out as soon as possible. .. (4) That tlie Government of India are at their wits&apos; end to provide British &quot;&quot;officers for the Indian Army, the Volunteers, and other forces. (5) As regards the original proposal to embody six battalions of Volun-teers, it is now stated that only one battalion will be embodied : for permanent duty in guarding- prisoners and half a battalion for . ... duty in Madras ; the remainder of the six battalions would be employed locally in relief of-British troops, v; (6) Equipment for 10,000 men required at once.As regards (2), the drafts are required for the three mobilised Divisions, that is to say for nine British battalions, one cavalry regiment, and the British proportion of Artillery for three Divisions. : I can hardly imagine that drafts on this scale: are really, necessary. It will practically mean that -in a year it would almost double the strength of the units concerned, and unless there is very heavy lighting on the frontieror an unprecedented amount of sickness such an augmentation can hardly be necessary..:; .. v&apos;-&apos;&quot;&apos;-::;-v--V.y;        - E.

War Office,Sir, .10th November 10.1.6.I am commanded by the Army Council to inform yon that they have had Tinder consideration the question of adding further to the man-power of the Empire by raising additional Indian units for service in theatres * where the climatic conditions are suitable. -  /-v 2. The Council are aware that some time must elapse before any such units will be available to take their place in the field, but in view of the fact that the. war may not end for a long time to come, they are emphatically of opinion that no effort should be spared to release. asmany white troops as possible from those now employed in the minor theatres for service on the main British front, and also to meet further demands which may arise in such theatres.3. They consider that, for example, the proportion of Indian units serving -in Mesopotamia and/Egypt might with advantage be considerably increased, and I am therefore to ask that the question of raising additional units, from the lighting races of India may be at once taken up and the result communicated . to this Department with the least possible delay. The Council are inclined , to think that if favourable terms of enlistment were offered, a considerable number of men might be forthcoming.I am, &amp;c ,The Under Secretary of State : R. H.

Your telegrams 3414 of 13th November and 3415 and 3410 of .14th November. Before answering your enquiries, a brief review of the military position in India seems necessary so that conditions limiting extent to which India can provide more troops may be clearly appreciated.; V India is at present assisting to maintain seven Expeditionary Forces/ overseas,; and has ; in : addition to provide troops for defence of her frontiers and for, maintenance of internal security.; The force available for former object, namely, to carry out; War Coinmittee&apos;s instruc-tions as conveyed in your telegram, 3335, dated 7th April, consists of 5,570 sabres, 120 guns, and 42,900 rifles. The Commander-in-Chief considers that with possibility, of having to defend 550 miles of monntain frontiers /with seven; main : points- of entry / against Afghan: and tribal; combination, capable of developing a force of 60,000 rifles, 200 guns and 60.000 armed tribesmen, present field army can only be regarded as adequate provided that its British troops are mobile and. fully trained/that they are: kept Up to establishment/and that: they.:, have training depots in India capable of meeting a monthl.y wastage for three months at 8 per cent, pen/ mensem.   Assuming that War Office will, guarantee these conditions, the Commander-in-Chief is satisfied, that India can meet/her frontier require-/: ments without drawing upon Egypt or other theatres of war for additional troops. . .;:/;:.He is of opinion that a secure frontier is the best guarantee of tranquillity in India/and therefore accepts, number of troops left available for internal:: security as sufficient for that purpose, although it is much below pre-war minimum.   Some of the Garrison and Territorial battalions are certainly not. the equivalent of regulars, but this- disadvantage is set off. :by: the fact that/: existing proportion of British to Indian troops secures favourable ratio of I to 1*6 as compared with 1 to 2&apos;5, which is the normal figure.   The Commander-in-Chief has prepared. the scheme adum brated below for. the purpose of releasing largest possible number of white battalions for service in main theatres of war, and considers following units might be placed at disposal of the War Office :-First, twelve Territorial battalions, of which six might be replaced by forming six embodied battalions of Indian volunteers and another six by bringing out equivalent number of Garrison battalions. Second, assuming the concurrence of General Officer Commanding, Mesopo-tamia, who has not been consulted in the matter, thirteen Service; battalions of 13th Division might be relieved in Mesopotamia, approximately by end of ! April, by thirteen Indian battalions, latter being replaced in India by raising thirteen new battalions.   13th Division, would thus be replaced by an Indian division consisting of the three British regular battalions lately formed to replace those taken at Kut, and ten Indian battalions. : Remaining three. Indian battalions would replace the three re-formed battalions on line of communications.    This proposal, you will observe, is restricted to the replacement of infantry units as we have not the means of replacing divisional troops.   Third, three Indian battalions now in Egypt might be expanded to two battalions each by drafts of young soldiers.In this manner 12 Territorial and 13 Service battalions could be made available by the spring, while three Indian battalions could be placed at the disposal of War Office, excluding those sent to Mesopotamia in replacement of 13th Division. These measures would be effected by embodiment of six battalions of volunteers, despatch to India of six Garrison battalions andMS 365 b --://)-
raising of 16 Indian battalions, providing our recommendations for bettering conditions of service in  Indian  Army /supply  stimulus   required   torecruitingIn order to render these proposals possible, sanction to following measures would be required at once :-First, passing of an ordinance making-military training compulsory for all Europeans and Anglo-Indians except those officially exempted, and extending liability of all volunteers to service anywhere within Indian limits. Second, promotion and full compliance by War Office with demands for reinforcements for. British units remaining in India. Third, prompt and ample supply by War.Office of guns, rifles, machine guns, equipment, and all up-to-date mechanical appliances required for transport for fighting. Fourth, release of ail British officers of the Indian Army now. at home, of or below the rank :of colonel, for duty with new Indianunits. Fifth, grant of free rations in India to all lighting ranks of Indian Army. Sixth, sanction of revised pension, scheme for Indian Army. Seventh, sanction of scheme for land grants and rewards for Indian. Army. The sanctioning by 1st January of last three items, which are the subject of separate references, would be essential in order to stimulate recruiting. Moreover, sufficient rifles and equipment would have to be provided at an early date to enable training to proceed.The i proposals above outlined indicate line of action recommended by Commander-in-Chief, who urges, desirability of releasing as many British troops as. can be spared for service on more important fronts. We recognise necessity of such action on Imperial grounds, and accordingly support his recommendations. // .v/  :        . No. 0.

War Office,Sir, ...        12th December 1916.I am commanded by the Army Council to acknowledge the receipt of your Letter No. M. 3426 of the 5th -December, enclosing copies of tele-graphic correspondence with the Government of India on the subject of the increase of Indian units with a view to releasing while troops for service in the main theatres of war. --y-y:/:/&apos;/       &apos;y&quot;.y-&apos;&apos;^-.: 2. In reply I am&apos;. to say that the Council very greatly appreciate the spirit in which the Government of India have approached this difficult problem and recognise to the full the sacrifices which their proposals entail, v3. The Council are. giving immediate attention to the provision of the: eix Garrison battalions, of drafts for British units in India, and of material, demanded by the Government of India as a necessary condition to the scheme, and.they trust that the latter will be instructed to initiate measures, at once towards raising the 16 additional Indian battalions,; 4. The Council, are in doubt as to whether: the demand for up-to-date mechanical appliances is intended to refer to an increase, of the mechanical transport now available in India to the quantity required for the troops to be retained in that country according to the scales allowed in British War Establishments. I am therefore to request, that the Government, of India may be asked to specify the number and class of mechanical transport vehicles referred to by the Oom.mander-in-Ch.ief, and the specific purposes for which they are required. .1 am further to request that, details may be furnished in regard to the amount of the equipment to be provided by the War Office under these proposals.5. It is observed that the Commander-in-Chief requests the relief of all British officers of the Indian Army now at Home, of and below the rank of Colonel. The number of such officers actually employed in the United Kingdom is small and their relief in most cases could be carried out without dislocation: . If, however, the officers employed on the staff of the armies in the field, in command of brigades and: battalions, and attached to the Royal Flying Corps are referred to, these are filling important posts
from which they could; not be removed without serious prejudice to efficiency. On the other hand the. proportion of senior regimental officers at any rate with British units in India is still considerably greater than in the case of similar units in France. The Council are therefore of opinion that the allocation of British officers whether belonging to the British or the Indian establishment is a matter which: must be approached from an Imperial standpoint, and that during the continuance of the war officers of both Services should be allocated where they can be most usefully employed. The Council will, however, be prepared to consider on their merits all applications for the return of individual officers to India as they arise.6. I am further to say that the Council hope that the India Office will find themselves in a position to sanction the proposals of the Government of India for the introduction of compulsory training for European and Anglo-Indians which the Council regard as of first importance to the realization of the scheme. The Council, presume that a separate communi-cation will be addressed to this Office as to the proposed concessions to :. :       Indian troops, in so far as Army funds may be affected.: 7. In regard to the provision of rifles I am to inform you that until the urgent outstanding demands of the forces in the various theatres have been.-- met, it will, not be practicable to allocate any considerable number of new rifles to India, and that a further communication will be addressed to you on this subject when it becomes possible to make a reliable forecast of future deliveries. -The Chief iof Imperial General Staff informed the War Cabinet to-day that the French Government was supplying a large number of rifles to Rumania and, therefore, that it might prove unnecessary for the British Government to supply the 100,000 which the Cabinet recently decided should be supplied.   The matter is not yet finally settled, but if the. : 100,000 are not sent it will be possible to meet India&apos;s requirements at. a correspondingly earlier date.- V-&apos;    .&quot;&apos; &apos;        ..-\.:.--     -/r I am, &apos;&amp;C,-&quot;.-&apos;&apos;.&apos;&apos;The Under-Secretary of State B.

As regards latter, please see my telegram of 15th instant, to which early reply desirable. As regards rifles, Army Council at present cannot make reliable forecast of.future deliveries, as urgent out-standing demands of field armies are still uncertain.,:- As regards your request for return of Indian Army officers of or below rank of Colonel, War.: Office state number of such officers employed in United Kingdom small, and relief could in most cases be arranged.   But
officers employed on; Staff of-Field Armies, in command, of Brigades and Battalions or attached to Royal Flying Corps, could not be removed from their important posts without serious prejudice to efficiency. Proportion of senior regimental officers, at any rate with British units in India, is still considerably greater than in similar units in France. Army Council consider that allocation of British officers, whether of British or Indian establishment, must be determined from Imperial standpoint and that they: must serve where they can be utilised to best advantage. Army Council will therefore consider on their merits your application for return of individual officers. In these circumstances, subject to any further remarks you. may wish to offer, I think best course will be for you to telegraph as soon as practicable list of officers whose services are deemed most essential to you and I will put it before the Army Council. I presume return of all named on list need .not be simultaneous. If so, please, state dates by which return of groups should be carried out.As regards compulsory training of Europeans and Anglo-Indians and extension of volunteer liabilities, please telegraph substance of proposed ordinance and use which, you propose to make of troops so raised. Please expdain what provision you propose for exempting either wholly or from other than local, service men required for ordinary official duties and. for necessary minimum for trading, banking, and so forth. It may. be useful to ascertain .practice followed in Ceylon and Straits Settlements, though local conditions there are simpler than in India. . .I am disposed to accept the scheme generally, if satisfied that it is practicable in these points, and if you are satisfied with War Office reply regarding rifles and officers.Tarn addressing you separately regarding concessions to Indian Army.No. 12.: From the India Office to the.

As each Garrison battalion arrives a Territorial battalion, will be placed at disposal of Chief of the Imperial General Staff. -: 2. It is. essential that the drafts for British units in the Field Army include the three, months5 wastage at 8 per cent, per month, as specified in our 13943 of the 30th November.  &apos;3. The rate at which we can make Indian battalions available overseas is. directly dependent upon the rate at which the Army Council supply rifles and equipment.. At least 40,000 rifles and equipment for 16 battalions and 10,000 volunteers are essential, before.we can complete the scheme, and we should be glad.if it is made perfectly clear to the Army Council that delay in supplying rifles to India entails delay in our contribution to Imperial forces.ms 365
... 4. Indian Army officers are required for the new units, the Volunteers, the Militia and such forces as the South Persian Rifles. It is not realised, apparently, how great is the drain on our resources imposed by Mesopotamia in this respect. The reference of the Army Council to officers with British units in India does not ajypear to us to he relevant to the above requirements. Moreover, the Army. Council know: that we have just sent them 27 officers from British units in addition to the 36&apos; officers sent home in September and October, and you will realise that in the mobile warfare Avhich we have to deal with well trained and experienced officers are essential in the eight regular British units which form the backbone of our position here in India. Moreover, when the absentees due to schools of instruction, sickness, &amp;c, are deducted, the number of officers of any experience present with battalions is very small. We will telegraph the lists you ask for, and will specify the dates by which the officers required should reach India.5. The substance of proposed Volunteer Ordinance will be telegraphed separately. The Commander-in-Chief contemplates the following employ-ment for the troops so raised :  .      &apos;. (a) Guarding prisoners of war. One battalion of Volunteers to be : f embodied for permanent duty anywhere in India. &apos;.(/)) Permanent duty in Madras.-Two companies Madras. Volunteers &apos; .    ;    embodied. &apos;   &apos; m &apos; .;*-/ &apos;:&apos; V/-/.; -/,.&apos;; (c) The organisation, equipment, and training of remaining Volunteers, ,from whom we would embody on an emergency 1,200 to replace :    British troops in sedentary duties, and 3,500 in mobile duties, of whom all but 600 would be in their own districts. -x. As exisling infantry volunteers for (a), (6), and (c) above total over 19,000, excluding Railway volunteers, there should be no difficulty in arranging for the exemptions you refer to. You will observe that the Commander-in-Chief does not now propose to embody six battalions of volunteers, as reported in our telegram of the 30th ultimo, No. 13943, but to embody permanently one and a half battalions,;and Only to organise, equip, and train the remainder sufficiently to meet any sudden emergency in this way; lessening . dislocation of business and diminishing expense on /accommodation; &amp;c.We require the equipment for 10,000 asked for in paragraph 3 above, to be able to meet any expansion of our present volunteer proposals.-;;f :\v\*       ;f&apos;;^&apos;/;-f.;:; ..fv:;:V:NoV14;/.&apos;;;//l; :/7:&apos;f:/^M:-From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Army Department, 2nd January 1917.13.

Reference to your 3433 cipher, dated 22nd January. (1) As far as can be foreseen at present and contingent on the supply of rifles and equipment, the need for which was emphasised in paragraph 3 of our No. 15306, of 29th December, Indian Infantry battalions can be relieved in time to embark for overseas as follows : Three battalions by the end of /February, four battalions by the end of March., four battalions by the middle of April, two battalions by the end of April. Oommander-in-Chief is addressing Chief of Imperial General Staff on this point in a telegram, copy of which War Office will doubtless furnish you with.(2) Secretary, War Office, has been informed in Chiefs 51.50 that Duke of Cornwalhs Light Infantry will proceed to Egypt.in the ship which arrives .:.&apos;. at Aden Oth February, bringing their relief.--(3) It is impossible yet to give even an approximate date by which organisation of the Volunteers under new Ordinance will, be sufficiently advanced to admit of the Territorial Force battalions proceeding overseas. We are still awaiting your approval to publication of Ordinance.- (4) It is presumed your telegram under reference cancels the War Cabinet&apos;s request that additional battalions : should be ready for: Egypt by August next, vide your telegram of the 2nd instant, No. 13.No. 19., From Commander-in-Chief, India, to Chief of Imperial General Staff,28th January 1917..-:-..-... 6070. Please see Viceroy&apos;s reply to Secretary of. State for India&apos;s 3435 cipher, 22nd January. As regards despatch to Mesopotamia of Indian Infantry battalions, new battalions relieving selected, battalions will, as far as can be at present foreseen, be read3T for duties assigned them as follows :  Three battalions by middle of February,&quot;four battalions by middle of March, -four battalions by beginning of April, two battalions, by middle of April. This estimate is dependent partly on return to India of men. of these regiments
from Force &quot;D,&quot; which has been asked for, hut more on issue of their rifles, equipment, and stores.. Fact that despatch of these battalions is directly contingent on supply by War Office of rifles and other necessaiy equipment reiterated in our telegram to Secretary of State for India. I cannot guarantee that all or any of them can be armed with serviceable rifles when despatching, this being dependent on speed with which you can supply me. It will be of assistance to myself and Maude if you could let us know whether it is intended to remove battalions of 13th Division only or complete Infantry . Brigade or Division as a whole. We cannot in the latter case supply Divisional Artillery, Engineers/Divisional Signal Company, medical unit, all of which should remain with Maude. What transport will go with 13th.. Division ?:. Following is for your and Maude&apos;s consideration : - v -      &apos;,-&apos;;/ - ;. ..   Making allowance of 14 days for relief movements, which in some cases--. entail chain of three or more moves, and on assumption of no. delay in sea transport, unlikely these units will reach Basra till three battalions by middle of March, four battalions by middle of April, four battalions by beginning of May, two battalions by middle of May.. By.time&quot;13th-Division can be relieved by these battalions, flood season will have set in, and there-after hot weather, imposing passive attitude on ourselves and Turks. There, will be considerable wastage, and unless these new troops are actually required in Mesopotamia it seems better course to keep remaining divisions there up to strength, at same time retaining fresh battalions concent rated in India in readiness to move where, and when required.:,: I have not told Maude of those proposals pending your reply, but he should now, I think.&apos; be.informed. &apos;&apos;     No. 20. ,       -From Chief of Imperial General Staff to Commancler-in-Chtef, India, - ;&apos;* &quot;.&apos;..&apos; 31st January 19.17.28707 cipher. Your 6070 of 28th January. It is our intention in order that the 1.3 white battalions of the 13th Division &quot;maybe-withdrawn and that Division converted into an Indian Division, to employ such native units as you can raise or spare. There will be available, for the . 1 nfantry Brigades of the hew Indian Division the three white battalions now at Sheik Saad, and the 10 Indian battalions required to complete can be selected at your discretion. .The artillery and nucleus of other divisional troops required to convert the 13th Division into an Indian Division will be left in Mesopotamia. Pioneer battalion will be withdrawn.. Regarding proportion of divisional units to remain a further communication will be sent.. - The battalions of the 13th Division so released will proceed.to Egypt, and so will the Territorial battalions now in India which you are preparing to release. It is important to get these units to Egypt as soon as possible, as they will be placed in new formations there.    What you say as to the. desirability of keeping.new formations in India till after the hot weather is fully appreciated, but it is equally importaut for the same: reason to reduce the number of Avhite battalions in Mesopotamia. The possibility of achieving this double object must depend upon the military situation in Mesopotamia, but to get the 13 white battalions to: Egypt is the primary object. It appears at present that Maude should be able to hold his own during the flood season without the Infantry of the 13th Division, but in the course of. the next few weeks it should be possible to decide this more definitely, by which time the intentions of Turks, as regards reinforcing their troops: in Mesopotamia, should be more evident. -------All preparations should in the meantime be made to carry out the programme above indicated. Everything possible is being done to expedite despatch of garrison battalions and rifles to you. Maude has not seen our telegram, and I leave you to communicate with him on this question. What you say should he reported to me.
