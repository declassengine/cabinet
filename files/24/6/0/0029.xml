The Foreign Office have been asked^to-point out the seriousness of the situation and to press for&apos;&apos;an immediate reply. .The lat ost weekly returns show that only 49,000 tons of coal arrived in Italy during the 1st week of February,   This amount, following upon a succession of weekly shortages, and with no&apos;.prospect of improving&apos;-;the. situation in the near future, has rendered the position of Italy exceedingly precarious.The representative of the-Italian Oovernnent on the Com-mission Internationale do Havitaille:-:ent lias stated that unless Italy received immediate assistance not only the offensive but also the  defensive v/ill be paralysed.; The possibility of conveying coal overland through certain French Atlantic ports is being carefully considered, but, owing t o the difficulty in the provisi on of trucks, it do es not appear likely that more than 2,000 tons a day could be sent by this means.
