-iUJfu,     ,331SECRET G.T. 95.WAR   CABIRET.THE    GERM AH -&apos;-&apos;PREPARATIONS -  PGR   Til   SPKIEG    ORFEKSlyE. /, (Letter- from Mr-. .P.G. Shaw to Sir kaurice I-Iankey.)&quot; 47 PINCHLEY. ROAD,.&quot;&quot; March 1st., 1917To the President &amp; Members of the: War Council. My Lords ; and Gentlemen,&apos;  ;&apos;&quot;:&apos;I venture to emphasise a very persistent and urgent warning which has been given, by more than one&apos; of the Americans who have just left Germany,  and to hope that they meaning of this friendly warning will.not be permitted to   -escape&apos; the noti c e of the L embers of the -War Cabinet -.     We are told that a coming danger lies &apos; in&apos; our&apos; under-estimating the   -,. gigantic military efforts of the Germans, of which they became, aware before leaving:.:G-eimany.;..--.::-&apos;-::&apos;The Germans in order to secure a preponderating&apos; and overwhelming force.-for their failitary -efforts in the coming Spring, at. some-one or more points cf. attack,.-are /amassing- guns,., shells, material and men at: easily covered distances, on -their /Western/front..;;- Are ve not in vigorously&apos; bombarding - one.&apos; small portion only of the vast German front, consuming an enormous amount -of: munitions,wear-   . ing out the best Of our. guns - by no means &quot;too numerous - &apos; and exhausting a very serious percentage of the best of our fighting forces?       &apos;   .  ,. &apos; &apos; . .Even is we Were-economising in this matter in order to cope with this threatened Spring- ef-f ort of the --Germans, - are the number of our&quot;men, guns,&apos; and quantity of our munitions /equal to that:which Germany is -amassing? -Since their thrust at Paris&apos;, have not all -the determined, effort s - of the; Gorman Army with one exception --/Verdun - been-.;, successful because of her ability to mass&apos;and concentrate her efforts in some- one definite point. of attack?- &apos;-.:.&quot;,-&apos;:.:- .&quot;-&apos;&apos; Even .Yerdun was;- only, attacked by &apos;a&apos;.comparatively small proportion&apos; of the German, forces, - and/ these verccormuanded by the Crown Prince,&quot; by no means.the most experienced of her many leaders. &apos;Will the fall ofLapaume, or the retirement of the Germans from any one sUch point, repay us for the disaster v/hich must ensuei if we are not able to meet the German&apos;s thrust in the Spring, with forces and munitions in every way &apos;- equal to their own, and at any point upon/which they might determine to attack?There can be no doubt, that the Germans are now preparing for their greatest, if not^hei r final - effort, t o cbt ain victory, while even a temporary disaster on one Eastern point will be fatal to us.We may; be advancing&apos;slowly over ground, which,for strategic purposes, they may be leaving to the fury cf our fire;   but are we going - - a^tiie rfifu-.it - of\ this swaia
and expensive success - to give them a preponderating advah-tage in men, guns, munitions, etc.-, and run the risk of their breaking through qu* lines at a moment- favourable to themselves.I venture, therefore, to appeal to your &quot;Council tc ccn-sider the probability of this very possible danger, to Which we. may-, - through the astuteness fcf the. German Military ccfcm&amp;nd,- .b.e rendering our-forces in France,liable,.     It has been ectablished bey.end question, that the Army With the heaviest, and most numerous guns,: the largest amount of shells and munitione, and With the most, exped iticuo metheds ef maintaining its- supplies, tnusi succeed&apos;in-breaking through their opponent&apos;s lines .in all places where the surf ace. advanr-tages are equal,-The two most imperative and vital questions are, therefore,-first/ are not the Germanus at the moment husbanding their resources, amassing munitions,  establishing final and rapid meahfe cf railway communications ^&apos;.amassing and saving their guns.,- resting their-forces and strengthening their lines by a strategic retirement to&apos; positions stronger and nearer to their munition;!fa cfc cries?Second, are not the British diminishing their forces, and advancing furfciver and further over more and more difficult country and away from their base and supply depots?Are they not Wearing out their guns, exhausting their munitions, weakening their means of communications and generally playing into the hands&apos;of-Germany/ in the optimistic but.dan-gerous belief that they are Winning, and gradually demolishing tho moral as well as the material forces of their foes?Is the fact that the Germans are retiring, or perhaps I should say, have chosen to retire, methodically destroying their trenches, wrecking roads and bridges and the villages they have occupied,  etc. a sign of defeat,  or that by their destroying and leaving behind them a few of their most worn out      mamoth guns, we are to regard this as a decisive defeat er to be considered as being a device to deceive our leaders.Foes..not the massing of their forces at vaiious - but quickly- covered distances - behind their lines, appear to point    .t$some suoh scheme?I beg to remain, my Lords and Gentlemen, Yours faithfully,(Signed).   FRED G. SHAW.
