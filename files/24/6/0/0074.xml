REPORT TO THS CABINET.February 24th, 1917.Developments I.   (i) In order to prevent any delay in the menu-pnd organisa-tion of the      facture or allocation of aircraft owing to avoidable Air Board.causes, a small Progress and Allocation Committee has been set up under the Chairmanship of Major J.L.Baird,iuP composed of representatives of the three or four De-partments concerned, which meets daily for a short time and ascertains precisely what material is coming forward end what difficulties or delays have arisen.     The Committee is working satisfactorily and it is found that, by temporary assistance from one Service to the other, it is sometimes possible to avoid serious delays in output.(ii) Steps have been taken to create a Central Air Intelligence Section which will concentrate all the information required both for the Haval and Military Air Services and for the Supply Department thereof. Design. II.     (i) Aircraft;-R.E.8. (Corps Reconnaissance) Aeroplane.Reports having been received that this machine shewed a tendency to get into a spinning nose dive, a keeting was held at *?hich Dr. Bairstow of the National Physical Laboratory heard the views of pilots who have flown the machine and experienced this tendency. The Active Service report on this machine is favourable and it was decided that the defect, if any, would be remedied by a larger tail and a larger stabilising fin.
B.3B.5. (Single seater fighter) Aeroplane.The cause of the recent accident to this new type of machine was thoroughly investigated and recommendations for improving the machine hy increasing the factor of safety were adopted as a precautionary measure.(ii) Engines: -R.A,3?,4d.This engine was tried with alum in ium cylinders and anew cam shaft.     It came out at approximately the sare weight as the Hispano Suiza, developed about the same h.p. ^nd the petrol oonsump-tion is remarkably economical.His-pano Suiza experiments have been carried out in France with a view to raising the compression and revolutions of the 150 h.p. Hispano Suiza. These experiments were very successful and under test this engine developed nearly the same h.p. as the 200 hyp. geared Hiepano Suiza.III.   (i)   In view of the increased requirements for seaplanes in connection with the measures taken to combat the submarine menace, arrangements havo been made to place an order for 200 seaplanes of the type selected.(ii)   In view of the satisfactory results above referred to of the aluminium cylinders tried in the H.A.?.4a engine, it has been decided to arrange for the adoption of the new design as soon as possible in the orders no?/ in course of execution, so as to obtain a supply of the improved engine sufficient
to carry on until an adequate stocJr of the new200 h.p, engines (Hiepano Suiza, Sunbeam and B.H.P.)becomes available.(Signed)   H, P. HAKVEY.Secretary to the Air Board.
