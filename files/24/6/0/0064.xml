G.T.-83.NEUTRAL VESSELS  LAYING  UP AND  MEASURES  FOR SECURINGRESUMPTION OF TRADE BY THEM.THE enclosed list of vessels laid up at home and abroad up to the 15th February is an exceedingly long one, and calls for serious consideration of the further measures that can be taken for getting vessels to put to sea.It may be well first to summarise briefly the action which has already been taken for this purpose.The question may be, for convenience, confiued to neutral vessels in Allied trades (vessels which merely call for examination at the United Kingdom, and are engaged in purely neutral trades are dealt with under a separate scheme).The most important lever on which we are relying for getting neutral ships but of neutral ports is the fact that we hold in British ports a large number of neutral steamers. We have let it be known that these will he released if fixed back with important cargoes, as and when similar vessels arrive in British ports. This does not, however, at present appear to have had much effect in inducing neutral vessels to leave neutral ports and come to the United Kingdom. A further measure has been adopted to deal more directly with neutral vessels in neutral ports by letting it be known that anv neutral vessel arriving in the United Kinp-dom with a full cargo of an approved commodity will be allowed to load a coal cargo in return to the country whose flag she : flies. . ::y:y&apos;y^ib:&apos;&apos;/^y:&apos;:b;::&apos;&apos;-://:\;.These are really the only direct measures which seem feasible for dealing with the problem of the refusal of neutral Governments or owners to let their vessels put to sea. Further subordinate measures have been put into force, for instance, by using the lever of detained ships to induce* the Danes and the Dutch to continue shipping agricultural produce to this country. Also the privileges in regard to calling at Halifax are to be made conditional upon the shipowner concerned agreeing not to lay up any of his vessels, and also to allow his vessels going outward in ballast to load coal in a United Kingdom port for the Islands or other bunkering depots. Additional proposals as to insurance and purchase are designed to create confidence and encourage owners to allow their vessels to put to sea either under their own control or someone else&apos;s.Now that all this action has been taken we are awaiting the effect upon neutral owners. It seems that the measures outlined above caunot be amplified in any way, and the only thing is to await the result. At present the result does not appear to have been very great.Further steps are now under consideration by which other action can be taken to encourage neutrals to put to sea. The most important of these is some arrangementas to pecuniary remuneration for crews of vessels coming to the United Kingdom. Also it is now under consideration to publish statistics of the tonnage which has passed in and out of United Kingdom ports since the 1st February, and perhaps also some kind of success of the anti-submarine campaign. It is hoped to obtain statistics on these two points from the Admiralty very shortly.The only remaining course, namely, requisition, has not yet been fully exploited, but enquiries are being made of Sir M. Findlay and Sir R. Paget as to the terms of requisition which might be explained to neutral owners. A definite scheme has, in fact, been put before Sir M. Findlay and Sir R. Paget, and&apos; the latter is being instructed to discuss this with Captain Cold and Mr. Anderson, who have, of course, intimated their willingness to allow their vessels to be requisitioned.* The inducement has had no results yet. G. S. S.
;    The situation appears to present two possibilities :-1. To wait and see. theresult,-,of the measures we have already taken. The arguments in favour of this appear to be that comparative quietness on our part would show that we did- not consider the German menaces to be serious, and it is possible that by waiting a little we may witness a gradual, restoration of confidence in neutral countriesi; especially if some bonus system can be arranged. Another cause likely to encourage neutrals to put to : sea is the fact that their own trade is very seriously hampered by the present state of affairs, crews are idle, &amp;c. There are signs already that -ships are beginning to run more frequently. The Holland; Steamship Company are running/&apos; and Captain.Cold is going to run three boats a week with agricultural produce. /Possibly if the amount of British and Allied shipping coming in and out of United Kingdom ports is made known, and a little judicial propaganda: done a gradual restoration of normal conditions may result. *2. To take the line that something must be done at once to get ships moving. The only action possible on these lines is to requisition all shipping held up in British ports. In this way we should make certain of getting tonnage for ourselves, provided the ships could be manned; but it is probable that we could not proceed suddenly to this course, owing to the effect in neutral countries.   Time would be required to arrange conditions.February 19, 1917. H. K.-H.I sent in a minute yesterday pointing out that two courses lay open to us now in regard to inducing neutral vessels to put to sea from neutral countries: 1. To await the result of the measures we have already adopted and, as far as possible, reinforce those measures by propaganda, the offer of bonuses, &amp;c.2. To take such drastic course at once, and requisition all ships on which we could lay our hands. -On the face of it, I should say that the former course is far preferable ; but in order to decide between the two it seems necessary to know how long we can, without anxiety, allow the present state of affairs to continue. This would require very close-invest igati on, and I think this investigation should be undertaken. The object would be to ascertain the exact psychological moment on which the non-sailing of neutral vessels will begin to. do us real harm. It would be at this moment that the drastic measure of requisitioning would become absolutely necessary. It would be necessary to ascertain-^ . - .(a.) How long our present stocks of foodstuffs and raw materials for military purposes will last.(b.) How much of these commodities continue to reach the country in British shipsand in other ships which are still sailing, (c.) How far the supplies of coal to the Allies can be continued under present circumstances.If these facts could be ascertained we should be enabled to arrive at an exact calculation of the length of time during which the drastic course of requisitioning would be unnecessary, and we should be able to decide exactly when to requisition. . In my opinion, requisitioning, if,carried out suddenly, will create great aggravation among neutral countries, and possibly lead to some retaliatory measure, such as refusal to allow non-requisitioned neutral ships to come to this country at all. It&apos; neutral countries take this line we should lose the services of any neutral ships which, during the period before requisitioning, had come into trade again in consequence of a restoration of confidence.: Even if we proceed to requisition as quickly as possible there; is bound to be an intermediate period, and I venture to think that a little time now would be time gained, as the discomfort of the present situation will be increasingly felt in neutral countries and, with the aid of a little propaganda, it may be possible to restore confidence. Thus if we adopt; a waiting policy we may get ships to come, to sea again.. But if we do this, and subsequently requisition, there may be.a danger of losing the services of any ships which in the meanwhile have started out again.       &apos;* Yes, but with a German safe-conduct. G. S. S.
I think the points to be decided are . -.   (a.) How long can we go on as at present, assuming. that the longer we put offrequisitioning the better from a political point of view ? (b.) When does it: become absolutely necessary to secure all available tonnageregardless of circumstances ?Having decided as to (a), there would be no harm in proceeding gradually to requisition any ships whose owners were amenable. - V-^:\&apos; H.
