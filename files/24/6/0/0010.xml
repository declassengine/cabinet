EFFECT 0!T MUITITIC3T SUPPLY II SHIPS ARE DIVERTED IROM TRANSPORT   . ;   OF MATERIAL S TO CARPIAGE OF .HIE AT.(Report of Advisory; C omm.it tee of. Ministry of. Munitions together, with oovering Minute, dated 8th February 1917)The reference to the Ministry made by the War Cabinet was referred to the Advisory Committee :of the Ministry and considered -by,them in conference v,ith the heads: of Departments. -(1)     The report slices that for March shipments of about100,000 tone and for April shipments of about 100,000 tons can be- jpostponed at the cost of some dislocation of factory uork in this country but- ;ithcut serious risk to the supply of munitions provided that 40,000 tons are added to the requirements of the; immediately succeeding .- m months. ,(2)     Atterition should&apos;:also be called to the fact that only part of the supply of raw materials such as copper ;    spelter and brass rod absolutely necessary for the out-turn of munitions is included in the: Ministry&apos;s tonnage . requirements because some munition making firms supply their ov,rn re-uirements by direct importation;   it is therefore necessary for protection to be&quot; given to these private supplies in addition to those imported direct by the Ministry and included in the monthly totals.(o),   The mostserious requirement/of the Ministry at the moment .is Iron ore from Spain and Mediterranean Ports;   during the l^stthree months shipments have, averared under 100.,000 tons a week against an estimated requirement, of about 150,000 tons a week,   hioh would give enough to : supply all) the furr,aees capable of  &quot;beingworked at present. t. There are consequently no working stocks, and many furnaces have already been shut down.     It is now reported that about 185,000 tons are on jhips v;hich are; afraid of leaving Spanish ports. :; &apos;If,supplies of this ore are dolayed more blast furrm.oes will have to be ;shut dov;n. mThe stock of Hematite Pig.Iron for use in oteel furnaces does not; now exceed 200,000 tons, equal to-two v/eeks supply.The British-output of Hematite ore is about 20&quot;: of rjquire-merits and unless the Spanish ore comes forward^ the output of acid steel .411 be reduced 80&apos;.-,  (Reduction in total output of steel acid and basic, v-ould be about 50^.) paralysing in its turn the output of plates for shipbuilding ..as: v/eli: as .the: shell and - gun programme. . .-&apos;(Sgd)     L .-Forthington Evans.Qth February 1917...
(1)   / The Committee have considered the question put forward by the Prime Minister in the letter of the Secretary of ,the Cor^ittee of Iiuperial Defence, addressed to Dr..Addison, . dated 2nd; February 1917, viz:- .&apos;   - - What would be the effect on onr munition supply: -//mv if ships&apos; were diver ted from the transport of materials for the Munitions Department to the carrying of v/heat for; the.next two months?. (2) They have consulted the heads of the Departments concerned and also Sir Percy Bates, Bart. (Commercial Branch of the Admiralty Transport Department).-     - (3)     They understand from Sir Percy Bates that tonnage is required chiefly for carrying wheat/ from Ivorth American Ports to this country and that if some of the tonnage,which it is proposed to;use for thecarrying of munitions; from these Ports can be released, immediate ULie could, be made&apos;-; cf it to meet ;the ridcessities of the case,     The Committee have accordingly looked at the question more particularly from this point of view;   . &apos; &apos;(4)     They./find that the estimated tonnage required/; .for -transporting munitions;from-United States Ports is:-In March,1917   - / -.294,115 tons ... In April, 1917   -   8713 SCO,     &quot;Details of this - tonnage are given in Appendix &quot;A&quot;.(5) /./-/ It must be borne in mind th at the whole&apos; of this -tonnage, con si st s , of manufactured art icles o r mat er ial e of : vital;-importance: for-.-the fulfilment of the Far /Office programme of requirements.     Any postponement cf supplies, therefore, may involve risk of shortage of supply of munitions to the   Army and this risk .-.111 be accentuated if the losses of merchant tonnage should prove serious enough to interfere tilth the early resumption of shipment of the postponed supplies.(6)     The temporary; holding back of supplies also involves a dislocation of;Factory production/and of/railwayT: /transport in America and ;,the: provision cf the necessary storage /which-, may not be available at;; short/notice for ail elasees of materi al.(7)     The;Immediate postponement of supply,is not  ; /practicable in view of quantities already on.rail, out it is believed that the maximum effect of any postponement decided upon can be r eached in. about three cr four ,.eeks.   If it is decided to divert shipping in March and April,- imsdiate steps Bill&apos; have to be taken and a proper, organisation arranged for in America to make the necessary alterations. :. (3)     It is not possible: to curtail the shipments of raw materials such as-Billets,&apos;, /&quot;orgings, copper, brass rod, pyrites, Ac. nor yet explosives and railroad.equipment.   -.&quot; -.
i.   (9)     There are, however, the following manufacturedarticles, the shipment o.f ,hich, it is understood from the ,   Heads of the Departments consulted might he postponed and tne goods stored on the other side until opportunity arises to i or ward them:- -/m&apos;-./March f 17April 717RemarksEnfield Rifles856 tons836 tons.H.E.

(13) It must, however, not be - forgotten1that if this tonnage is diverted, a corresponding increase of. tonnage may have to be added :tc bring tie goods to this country in subsequent months.(14) The Committee consider that before any arrangements are.-made to carry out the above suggestions the transport branches should tilscuss the matter with each of the departments concerned so as to obviate dislocation as much as possible. ::The Advisory Committee.
