Draft Circular. Draft 2Uh February:Local Tribunals, .       . . \    R. 122.Appeal Tribunals.Local Government Board,- a Whitehall/ S.W.,February, 1917.i. under 31 years of age. It is imperative that more young men should be obtained for the Army. The War Cabinet have decided that, with certain exceptions (which include men in certified occupations), all certificates of exemption granted by-Tribunals to men under Si years of age shall be reviewed. An Army Council Instruction carrying out this direction and constituting an application for the review of all the Certificates in question is enclosed.On receipt of this Instruction it becomes the duty of the Tribunal, without any further application, to review the certificates of,all the men covered by the Instruction. Military Representatives have been directed to place themselves in communication with the Tribunals and to give every assistance in determining what individual certificates will have to be reviewed, but it is the duty of the Tribunal, and it is important that this should be done without delay, to proceed at once with the review of certificates without waiting for any communication from the Military Representative.Appeal Tribunals should send immediately to the appropriate Local Tribunals any papers in their possession relating to the granting of any certificates which under the Army Council Instruction have to be reviewed by the Local Tribunals. Where the certificate has been granted on a decision of the Appeal Tribunal varying the decision of the Local Tribunal the case will have to be reviewed by the Appeal Tribunal.Lord Rhondda fully appreciates that this new measure will throw a considerable amount of work on the Tribunals; but he is sure that he need scarcely point out the urgency of reviewing the cases with the utmost celerity. The Government wish to press strongly on Tribunals, and also on applicants for exemption, that a critical stage in the progress of the war is being reached and that it behoves every man to do his utmost so that the military authorities may have at their disposal the largest possible number of men at the earliest possible date.The demand for men placed not only in medical categories A and Bi but also in medical categories Ci (which comes next in military value after A and Bi) and in Bii and Cii is at present so urgent that exemption is not justified on any ground, whether of employment or hardship, unless there are exceptionally strong reasons. If the man is covered by the list of Certified Occupations, his case has to be decided according to the special provisions relating to such cases.       /::. 2- : Regulations.-A copy is&apos;enclosed of new Regulations; R. 123, under the Military Service Acts.   The following is briefly the effect of the new Regulations :-Provision is made whereby, on the receipt of the Army Council Instruction as to the general review of certificates, the Tribunal shall forthwith fix a date for the hearing of the cases and give due notice of hearing. In future in the case of applications for exemption on the ground that the ; man is in a certified occupation, the Military Representative may raise the contention, without previous written notice to this effect, that it is not necessary to retain the man in civil employment even though he is in a certified occupation. The burden of proof will still rest on the Military Representative. Employers and men must be prepared with evidence to meet the contention if raised; but if in any case it appears to the Tribunal that, in fairness to the man or his employer, the case should be adjourned to give an opportunity of producing further evidence, it should be adjourned for a short period.&quot;(10509.)

All Applications on the ground of business or employment in respect of men engaged at multiple shops must in future be made to the Tribunal for the area in which the man is employed. -   Provision is made in the Military Servce Acts that certain classes of men shall not be required to &apos;join the Colours until two months after the expiration of their certificate of exemption.   Hitherto these men have .: been able to make an application for a renewal at any time within the two :-./-.v-&apos;.months.   It is now provided that any such application must be made -;   within two weeks of the expiration of the certificate of ^exemption; the man in any of the classes covered will still not be required to join the Colours until two months after the expiration of his certificate. At present acase can be re-heard only with the consent of the Army Council if a man has already joine&apos;d the Colours; it is now provided that the consent of the Army &quot;Council must also be obtained- in a case in which a notice has been issued requiring the man to join the Colours. ;If one party to a case is required to withdraw the other party must also be required to withdraw. This regulation has been made in consequence of proceedings in a case in the High Court. A direction has already been issued to Military Representatives on the matter. - To avoid waste of time; parties, should not be required to withdrawn unless this is really necessary; Tribunals will often find it possible to confer in private while the parties remain in the room. .     . &quot;-   It is made clear that application for the renewal, withdrawal or variation of an exemption shall generally be made to the Tribunal to which the appli-- cation would have been made had it been an original application.;3. Instructions-The new Regulations, R. 123, are hereby also declared to be Instructions for the cases of voluntarily attested men. in so. far as they are applicable subject to the following adaptations :-        ;-&quot;     &apos;   &apos;.- The word &quot; Instructions&quot; is to be substituted for c&apos; Regulations &quot; whereverthe latter word occurs. -.&apos;.&apos;/-Theprincipal Instructions &quot;means the Instructions, R. 86, which came into .7        force on the 12th June, 1916.     /&quot; .   :    . .       . - .-: eSction 2 and section 5 (c) of Part III. of the new Regulations do not apply to the cases of attested men. ;. - - &quot; - : / - -&apos;The following, additional Instruction is hereby made:  &apos;:-&apos;.-v: &quot; Rule 5 of Section VL -of Part I. of the principal Instructions is hereby re-scinded, and the following rule is substituted therefor :&apos;--V 5. .(a) Where a man does not hold a certificate of exemption, but his name is&apos; marked in the Military Classification Register as not to be called up -for service with the colours, on the ground that he is engaged in a certified occupation, the m ilitary representative may at any time apply, by sending notice in the prescribed.&apos;m in duplicate, to the Local Tribunal, for a decision that the man should be rendered available to be called up for service with the Colours upon the following - grounds, or either of them :-- -(i.) That the man-s principal and usual occupation is not, in fact, one of thecertified occupations; or -(ii.) That, notwithstanding that the man&apos;s principal and usual occupation - is one of the certified occupations, it is no longer necessary in thenational interests that he should continue in civil employment.(5) Upon receiving notice 0f application under this Instruction the Local Tribunal shall forward the duplicate form of application to the. man in respect of whom the application is made, and shall fix a date for the hearing of the application; and upon the hearing shall grant a certificate of exemption or shall direct that the mark against the name of the man in the Military Classification Register be removed and that the man be rendered available.to be called up for service with the Colours according to the merits of the case : Provided that in the event last mentioned an application may be made by or in respect of the man.for a certificate of exemption in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as. an application for the renewal of a certificate.&quot;
4. Notices of Decisions: Appeals.--It is imperative that notices of decisions shall be delivered and appeals sent forward without delay. To secure despatch a new notice of decision, R. 125, has been.prepared, which involves the minimum of clerical work and which, whenever an exemption is refused, should be handed to the man or the applicant, as the case may be, at the close of the hearing.: Appeals should be sent forward as a rule at the latest within two days of their receipt: It must always be borne in mind that the urgency of avoiding delay is now very much greater than at an earlier period.A special notice of hearing,R. 126, for the review of a Certificate under the terms of the Army Council Instruction has also been prepared.A small supply of the new. forms is enclosed. Additional copies will be sent by the Stationery Office on requisition in the usual way.: - 5.
