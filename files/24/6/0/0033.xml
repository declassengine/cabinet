SEC E E !, 33.WAR CABIffBT Munitions output and Recruiting (Memorandum by Lord Derby)With reference to Part II, paragraphs 8 and 9 of the memorandum hy Dr*Addison on Munitions Output and liecruiting dated l th.February, 1917, which are reproduced in an Appendix to this note, I wish to circulate the following observations1. The Minister of Munitions is incorrect in implyingthat the substitution machinery only got into operation on 23rd.December, the real date on which the scheme was initiated being 26th.October, 1916, when after prolonged consultation with the Ministry of Munitions the War Office circulated their letter -27/Sgb./l (XUL4JFrom.that date up to 2nd.February, 1917, the total number.... ** .&apos; &apos;    &apos;    -of substitutes provided by the War Office and absorbed by the Ministry of Munitions was 11,681 out of a total 73,000 men made available, and placed at their disposal by the War Office.   Against that the number released to tho Army is returned by the Employment Exchanges as being 7,10? leaving a deficiency of some 4,500 due to the Army on past action.    Many of the 7,107 have applied to Tribunals whereas others are under notice to Join the Colours, about 6,000 have already reported.11. 2o carry out the medical examination and to returncompleted forms to the Divisional Officers has undoubtedly proved a slow and tedious business, the reasons being three-fold.(a)   The impossibility of obtaining immediately a sufficient number of trained Medical Officers to act as Presidents to the Boards.    The duties of President of a Medical Recruiting Board are not such as can be performed by any medical practitioner until-he
lie aas liad ox^portmiity to become familiar with the forms and general procedure.    The expedient of appointing civil Medical Practitioners as  residents of these Boards was tried - with disastrous results.2he duties of these Medical Boards are of an extremely onerous nature, and tho hours worked are Tory long.    Since the beginning of the year over a quarter of a million men have had to be Medically examined, whie?a has kept all the Boards at present in existence working at very high&apos;-pros-sure.(b)  larked disinclination, and in somo cases y^oint-blanlr refusal of Divisional Officers to accept back Forms H.M.8S and M.M.82.H. until completed.    Shis is a very fruitful source of delay, tho return of xorms containing perhaps .100 names being held up because one man whose name appears on it has not been examined, either because he refuses to present himself for exam-instion or because lie is ill in bed.(c) Tne delay produced in many eases by Managers and employers putting difficulties in the way of men going to be examined, and even flatly refusing to allow their men to go, saying if the Army Authorities wish the men examined, they could come and do it at the works.2he. totals shor/n by the Minister of Munitions of ; 376,161 whoso names have been submitted by Smployraent Exchanges1 for medical examination is misleading,.    According to tho Board of Sratle returns the total numbers shown on. M.M*8  and XL21.82 up to the 2nd February isonly 363,308*    Of those over 100,000 have been sent to the Military Authorities within the last three weeks, and the men could not possibly yet hasre  been examined. All arrangements for the examination of .&quot;--^e;:;:i$0ii&apos;tove-fcbe made after the lists are r&amp;eeivs&amp;.Similarly...
-        Similarly the numbers given- by the Minister of Munitions as the total of &quot;A&quot; men are misleading *   $he numbers passed fit for &quot;A&quot; prior to 31st December-1916 are not immediately available, but in fact during the 6 weeks since the  $ginning of the year, Medical Boards havo passed fit for category &quot;A&quot; over 20,000 men at present employed in I4unitions, and in order to do so have:-had -to -examine Just over 42,000 men.Further it has to be noted that f by arrangement with.... the Ministryof Munitions, the Military were not to examine in all works all. men shown on the lists.i ahc arrangement was that in cases in which a works ;could, presumably spare,; for example 100 men, the Board was to examine!whatever number was necessary-, to fimd the. hundred among . those who^-. co^iild most readily bo spared and. thon stop examining in that/^orks and proceed to some other.*    Thus    000 names might;-&apos;beiShovvn on a list, and only 150 might havo to be examined-/for/the $$edical Board to. complete its work..,-. -V/t   . I       to bo - - &quot;    &apos;&quot;-     -.      r   - - ;\ ,   it i^ noted that apparently the Minister ofLkinitions; in. order to secure the total of 376,161 men whoso -names lie&apos; states he has handed to the /Military&apos;.-, authorities&apos;rausi/harve;&apos;included. 107,853., men returned&apos; on i/i.lUForm 82 K.w^th itMciii,. to the rjiowledge of his officers,; including theMreetor/QenCral of labour Supply, the Uilitary authorities&apos;- tvere^ln. nf way concerned,   ^hese are the names of menspecificai.^y -excluded from the agreement/existing: betweenthe far Office and the Ministry of Munitions with the approvalof &quot;iilie VTar Cabinet,
APOTDIXj&amp;xtract from Pr. Adaison*s Memorandum of 13th ffeb. 1917,8. On 19th January the War Cabinet decided1. (d)    fhat 50,000 semiskilled and unskilled men now engagedin munitions works should be made available for general service by the end of January, and that the Ministry of Munitions should proceed with the measures already in operation fortfcis purpose? : : . .This decision refers to the general service men aged 18 to 30 inclusive to be released from munitions works under what is known as the Substitution Scheme.    Comparatively few men hare so far been released under this scheme, partly beeause the machinery since the Array Council Instruction of 83rd December was issued has taken some time to get into operation.      The main cause of delay, however, has been slowness in medical examination.9* Up to 2nd February, according to figures supplied by theEmployment Exchanges, returns covering the names of 376,161 men had been sent to the military authorities.      These men were to be medically classified in order to discover those fit for general service.      On that date the number returned as having been medically examined was 41,766 of whom only 12,664 were placed in Class rtArt.30 A forcible illustration is furnished hy the state ofaffaire at Barrow.     here are in this place 12,000 men to be medically examined.    A mediaal ooard has &quot;been engaged there for the last three weeks, and during that period they have examined only 1,700 men.    At the present rate of progress, the examine-tion of the men at Barrow will not he concluded until some time . during May,31.&apos; It is quite impossible for the Ministry to make substan-tial progress with the release of the 50,000 men until they are infottaed which men are to be Class *A*, but provided a sufficient supplyof suitable substitutes is forthcoming, the Ministry see no reason why this system should not give good and more accelerated results.
