- State of the Air Services with British --Expeditionary :&apos;3TQ&apos;roerr(Correspondence &quot;between Air Board, the War Office and the iTield MarBhal Comraander-in-Chi ef y British Arid,es in Prance.)I.Air Board ^Secretary,  C.I.D. AIR BOARD,OFFICE,Strand, W.C.lot Larch, 1917Sir, -&apos; ...       -  ;I am directed by the President of the Air Board to acknow-ledge receipt of your letter ho.,7 .B.I. of the 26th ultimo for-warding copies of a letter, dated the 15th February from the Pi eld marshal Conmiander^irwChief on the subject of the present position in regard to the output of aeroplanes for the Expedi-tionary Force in France.I am to state for the information of the War Cabinci^ihat the letter of the Field marshal Cm:ir:iander-in-Chief v/ao duly laid before the Air Board and referred by them to the Director General of Military Aeronautics, whose Department ordered, and is still responsible for, the supply of the machines for the British Expeditionary Force, to the non-arrival of which in accordance with expectations Sir Douglas Haig new draws attention.The Air Board have been supplied by Lieut/General Sir David Henderson with the terms of the reply dated the 24th February, a ccpy of which is herewith enclosed, addressed by the Army Council to the Field &quot;marshal Commander-in-Chief, in which the facts are set forth as regards the extent and causes of the delay which has occurred in the despatch ef the 3quad-rons to France, and as regards the manner in which the deficiency will be in a measure made good, partly by Squadrons lent by the Royal Kaval Air Service and partly by aeroplanes and engines procured from French sources,The Beard think it right to add the following cbserva-tions.     They understand that no promise was given by the Director General cf Military Aeronautics with regard to the aeroplanes in question.    -V/hat was furnished to the Commander-in-Chief was a forecast of the dates at which it then appeared -: probable that the various new squadrons would be available, That this forecast has not altogether been realised is due partly to the fact that it related to some extent to aero-planes which were ,at that time ,in the experimental stage, some of whioh have sinee proved a f ailure;:   and partly, tc the difficult manufacturing conditions prevailing in thio country, of which the War:.Cabinet are fully aware.The Board and the Ministry of Runitiono are gradually taking over the-duties/in connection with the design and oupply of aircraft which have recently &quot;been assigned to&apos; them.     It will be readily understood that; the transfer of functions involved and the ar-ialgamaticn of Certain. ITaval and 25.Hitary Department 3 are processes which must be carried *ut with considerable care and deliberation if a breach of continuity in..the supply of aircraft is to &quot;tea avoided. Moreover the position as regards the output facilities of the country requires oaref ul investigaticn, which is :being carried out by the; Controller of Aeronautical Supplies and the Controller of Petrol Engines.   As soon as. ever the Beard are in a position to prepare as trustworthy programme of air-craft deliveries they will furnish a repcrt on the subject-to the War Cabinet. &quot; &quot;I am,  etc.&apos; -   (Signed).

War Of f i c e to Field Marohal Command er-in- Chief, BritishArmies in France../;:/;;WAR OFFICE. 24th February, 1917Sir,In reply to your letter No, 0.E./1637,  of :13th February, addressed to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, on the subject of the increase.to the Royal Flying Corps under your ocmmand,  and to the replacement of material for the use of that Foree, I am commanded by the Army CouncII/-- 10 inform ycu that this matter has been receiving the closest attention.With reference to Squadrons for Corps Reconnaissance purposes, of which you have been informed that twe new 3 quad-rons, and replacements of material for three other Squadrons cannot, be ready by the date forecasted in Sept ember last, ocn-siderable quantities of material are now ready, and the d espatch of these reinfo re em ent s and rep1acement s wi11, frcm new inwards, be continuous, the rate of despatch depending chi efly en the weather, and on the number: of fer ry pilots who can be made available.The number of fighting squadrons which are late in delivery to tho E.P.- is five, although in your letter under reply the estimated deficiency is only four.     One of these on the September programme was to be equipped with 130-H.P. Sopwith Two-seaters, but by desire of the General Officer Commanding, Royal Flying Corps, Expeditionary Fcrce, this has been withheld in crder to be equipped with machines of a different type which are to come forward later.     Of the remainder, three are due to go out in March, although pessibly two of them will have only twelve machines each..    In addition to the September programme, two fighting squadrons of the R.N.A.S. have already joined the E.F., and another is due tc -join on 15th March.     The present deficiency in fighting squadrons, therefore,  should, it Is hoped, be made up by 31st March.Of the replac ements in fighter s,  one squadron should be ready by 31stMarch, and two flights of &quot;another bythe same date      It is understood, also, that the machines of two fighting squadrons have already been replaced by new type aeroplanes and engines procured dlrect from French sources.With reference to a reserve of Corps Reconnaissance Squadrons, ITo, 53 Squadron has already been sent out, although equipped with old typ.,. instead cf new type aeroplanesThe Army Council understand, therefore, that the pro-gramme of 3eptember, 1916, which was based to a considerable extent on the estimated value of unproved types of aeroplanes and engines, some of which have proved,to be failures, is about o n e m on t h iat e..   -. The d e lay, whi ch is t o s om e ext ent due to the inherent difficulties of supply, principally, of raw mat eri al und er pre s ent c ondi t i on s, has be en aggr avat ed by the request of the General Officer Commanding, Royal Flying Corps, Expeditionary Foree, that aeroplanes should be. sent by air, instead of in packing   cases.;     The result of compliance with this result has been that during every period of bad weather there has been congestion at the manufacturer&apos;s works, and consequent slackening of output.     If more aeroplanes
could &quot;be received &quot;by Sea, supply v/ould be more regular.I am to add that, although delay has unfortunately been incurred, for the reasons given above, in bringing the Air Forces under your command to the standard desired by you, it is hoped that the priority which has now been secured f or aircraft construction and the amalgamation of Favai and Military requirements in aircraft supply, will lead to material improvement in the near future,I am, Sir,  ,Your obedient Servant,(Signed)   B;E.
