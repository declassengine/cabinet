I desire to call urgent, attention to the serious position of Agriculture.     Politically, I an sure that this is :   the most assailable point of the Government position^The morale of the farmer has been dangerously,disturbed by the interferencecwith labour and w 1th prices, that have been announced   to him during the last ten months.     Unless it is restored, and restored immediately, production will shrink, and the country will be left with&quot; ft ;yery&apos;;.diraihi shed/. ;suppiyc of/home-? grown food for 1917, and little effort will be made to increase production for 1918*     If any step is taken in the direction of ; increased food production it should be taken and announced at once.Food is wanted, and in as ^reat an abundance as possible. A system of guaranteed prices lasting over a series of years seems to     ne to be the only possible means which would restore confidence to the farmer and encourage him to embark upon increased production, with its attendant initial outlay and risk, without fear that a sudden change in the market nay render his vsnture unprofitable.     Hi^h prices will certainly continue for some time after the cessation of hostilities, because of the delays of demobilisation, the continued absorption of tonnage for that purpose, and the shortage of both men and food in Europe consequent on the war.     Lut the farmer is not convinced of thiso Ke has an idea that the stocks of food in the world are as iarse as ever, and that they will immediately be liberated on the conclusion of peace, with a consequent slump in prices to the , level which he knew in the nineties.     He does not mean to be cauriht with an increased area of arable land should this fall occur.     The pov/ers of the Food Controller and of the war O-Tfice have also filled him with the fear that, even if prices are high;;
his produce.may be commandeered at unremunerative rates.To meet the farriers&apos; apprehensions; in both these:, directions a double system of guarantees is proposed, which should   : commence for the harvest of 1917.In the two months since the contract priees for 1917 &apos;7ere adopted by the Var Council, conditions have materially changedc The rise of wa.^es has already been considerable, and the programme of the Director of National Service will raise then still higher. The men he will furnish to the farmer will-.- be comparatively -.:, inefficient, hence the increase in the cost of production will be far greater than would appear from the   rise in the rate of warses. The demand of the Vardffice for 30,000 men from Agriculture has been a very severe shook to farmers.   ; It has also proved impossible to brinr; down the price cither.of feeding-stuffs or of fertilisers.     Finally, the season has so far been most unfavourable.     Therefore I think that a modified policy is;foreed u-non us. - &quot;The double system of rmarantees is thio:-(1)   A lininuvi to which the State contracts to make up the price, so that the average return to the farmer does not fall below; the nininum..     This should apnly to 1917for the duration of the war, and for two years after peace has been signed.For 1017 it is proposed that the minimum price for wheat should bo 60/- per 504 lbs.;    for oats, St./6 per ?36 lbs.;    for potatoes,;-H6. per ton.     tor 1918 and two years after peace is sirmoi, the minimu   prices should be for wheat, 55/-, for oats, 32/-, for potatoes,  4., 10*.     The actual prices are certain to remain above these- minima * so that the guarantee is unlikely to prove costly to the State.. (2)   minimum prices; be]ow which the btate undertakes not to commandeer produce during the sane period. .. For 1917, -these   linima would be - for wheat, 70/-;    for oats, ^O/-;
for potatoes,  8.     This guarantee involves no outlay on the part of the State;    it only limits the powers of the State to deprive the farmer of potential profits. /yThe&apos;scale on which I should propose that these two minima should he fixed for 1918 and for two years after peace has been signed;are as follows:-   wheat, 55/- and 70/-;    oats , 32/-and 45/-;   potatoes,  4. 10. 0. and  7.The farrier thinks in rotations of 4 to 7 or 8 years. The period specified - two years after the conclusion of peace -may therefore not be long enough to enable him to realise his capital outlay in embarking upon an extension of arable.     For this reason the minimum guarantee of (l) should be continued indefinitely, though on a lower scale.     The scale suggested is -for wheat ,45/-;-for: oats; 24/-It would be unnecessary to retain a guarantee for potatoes.; ]Jy this systemj the farmer is secured by (l) against disastrous, though very improbable, lossos which might be caused by a break in the markets.     He is secured by (2) from what ho regards as an injustice.     between the two: limits fixed he has a free market.     The natural price is never raised to the consumer, xhough the State may be called upon to bear some loss should the natural price fall below the guaranteed price Of (l)*;;;:::   The lonn period guarantees should be accompanied by Ic-islation securing a standard wage, and providing for pressure on the landowners to secure that the land should bo used in the national interests     It night also be considered necessary during the war period to limit the power of landowners, exoept in the case of a charrce of tenancy, to raise rents without the sanction of tho Board of Agriculture.The:policy put forward above would be only an instalment of further steps in the direction of puttinrz rural conditions on a sound footing as re-rards housing, reclamation, education, etc.
;, If the war Council were willing to adopt the policy which I hove outlined, it is the only one which I could wholeheartedly - support.-.: ; 7 I fcel certain that it would 1 ead to a considerable and continuous effort on the part of farriers to make tho country more self-supportinn..    \/ithout it, I do not think that any substantial effort can be made, or indeed reasonably expected.\ im-T/^r-&apos;.&apos; &quot;..The debate to be initiated in the House of Lords by Lord Chaplin would, I believe, result in the defeat of the Governiient unless, they are prepared to adopt this policy.     I very much doubt whether in the House of Commons the Government could withstand a motion to carry it out.     From what I hear, the Leader of the Opposition is working in this direction.
