Kankey,- The First Lord and Dr.Addison have been discussingthe question of the present position as regards the business connected with petroleum products, and they are agreed that there -should be an Interdepartmental Committee to deal with and co-ordinate the work of the various DepartmentalCommittees at present dealing v/ith the subject.A conference between the.Departmenta concerned has been held and&apos; a general agreement has been reached as to the conditions under mick the Comiv.ittee is to work and as to the Terms of Reference.Looking to the important, functions which the Interdepartmental Ooiffiiittee will, have to exercise, the First Lord thinks that before it is finally agreed to assemble the Committee the question should be. mentioned to the Prime Minister for his approval, and he may consider it of sufficient importance to bring before the War.

Your obedient Servant.PROPOSEDvCFBTRAL INTERDEPARTMENTAL -PETROLEUM .03MMITTEE..At present the various questions affecting the supply and distribution of petroleum are dealt with-by. several Departmental Committees which are in sufficiently close touch vvith each other and there is no central body to co-ordinate the activities of these Committees-&apos;and exercise a general supervision as to policy.The Committees in question are(1)   The Committee for the Regulation of Petroleum Supplies on which the Admiralty, Far Office, Board of Trade and . Ministry of Munitions are represented&quot;and which reports to the Ministry of Munitions..   This -Committee deals with the maintenance and proper distribution of petroleum supplies other than those directly imported for Government use. (2.)   The Petrol Control; Committee which reports to the President of the Board of Trade.; &quot; The Government Departments which are usersoi petrol are not represented. (3) -An interdepartmental Conmiittee which sits at the Colonial Office and on which the Admiralty is represented. &apos; It deals with questions of oil exploration throughout the Empire but, mainly&apos;in the Crown Colonies.The view. of. the; Ministry of Munitions was that, the; appointment of a body possessing co-ordinating and where -necessary, controlling functions-; in-;regardyto;;;pe.troleum matters was a pressing need and that an Interdepartmental Committee should be appointed -ath authority to consider and decide upon the action desirable .and 2ive instructions to - the departmental committee concerned.;  The Interdepartmental Committee would deal not only with questions immediately arising out of the war, but would take such action in regard to oil supplies generally as might be necessary in view of conditions likely to prevail subsequently.
In order to give effect to this view, which was oon-currecl in by the various Departments concerned, it is propc sed that an Int erdepartmental Coramitt ee . should be - established, under the Chairmanship of Mr. L.G.-Pretyman,    . Civil Lord of the Admiralty, to: consist of representatives of the following Departments, via .: -. 2 Admiralty2 War Office . - 2 Board of Trade &apos;2 2::inietry of Munitions 1 Colonial Office1 Controller of Shipping (Transport Depart.)Representatives, ofthe Foreign Office and India Office would attend when quest ions.&apos;.affect ing tho se Department s came up for discussion and the Committee would also- be frsei3ted by technical advia er s.The Inter department o.l Committee would be kept in cio se touch with the Departmental Committees through the repre-aentatives of the various Departments or by inviting the attendance of members of the Departmental Committees at meetings of the Central Committee.It would be open to the Interdepartmental Committee to propose modifications from time to time in the present functions of the various Committees, to suggest the appoint-ment cf new committees or to appoint sub-committees to deal wjth or to examine various aspec t s of- thi s sub j ect, whi oh is already of the highest importance and which is likely in the near future to lead to questions of the greatest urgency.The Interdepartmental Committee would keep in touch with such bodies as the Board of;Fuel Research which has just been appointed.Terms of Reference.To consider all questions of petroleum Products and make recommendations as to the best means of securing the-necessary supplies and their distribution, and to co-ordinate and superintend the policy of departmental and other Ccm-mittees dealing with various sections of the subject.
J PETROLEUM SUPPLIES*A meeting was held at the; Admiralty on Thursday, the 15th inst. to discuss a proposal for co-ordinating the policy of all Government Departments now dealing with questions arising out of the supply and distribution of petroleum products.Present:-Mr.E,G.Pretyman, H.P., Civil Lox^d of the Admiralty.;-.&apos;(in the Chair)Sir Graham Greene, t,6.B., Secretary of the Admiralty,Mr,J.C.Clarke.      representing the Admiralty.Mr.W.F.Marwood CB,,      &quot; *   Board of TradeKr.Lancelot Smith &quot; &quot;      &quot; &quot;Mr.Corner 0 &quot;   War OfficeSir Frederick Black, K.C.B. 11     &quot;   Ministry of MunitionsMr. E.Houghton Pry ; &quot;   : &quot; 11 &quot;;; ;   Sir Graham Greene briefly outlined the reason for the meeting and stated that the Admiralty were of opinion that there should be oo-operation between all the Departments and Committees dealing with Petroleum matters.   He instanced (a) the Ministry of Munitione Committee for the Eegulation of Petroleum Supplies (b) the Board of Trade Petrol Control Committee (o)   the Admiralty Oil Fuel Committee and (d) the Colonial Office Interdepartmental Committee on Oil Leases in Crown Colonies.   Sir Graham Greene said that he under-stood Dr. Addieon fully concurred in this idea and he read a portion of Dr.Addison^s letter to the other Government Departments putting forward the suggestion for the formation of a co-ordinating Committee. He said the meeting would be interested to learn whether Sir Frederick Black could carry the views of the Ministry of Munitions any farther.Sir Frederick Black said that the views of the Minister were that considerable benefits could be obtainc-d from complete co-ordin-aticn and that this was the object for which he thought they should strive, and endeavour to attain a combined Petroleum Policy for all Departments of the Government.   The Committee referred to would no doubt continue in existance but their functions would be pro-perly related to the new Committee.Mr. Mar wood said that the Board of Trade&apos;s idea was that the proposed Committee would be advisory merely and would not touch any after War problem and he read the Board of Trade!o reply to Dr. Addison*s letter..Sir Frederick Blaok said that it was difficult and indeed unnecessary in this case to draw a definite line between advisory and executive functions.   The Committee would not perhaps take exe-cutive action itself but Its reoommendations to a particular; Minister or to the Cabinet would embody the considered opinion of the Govern-ment Departments concerned, and could not fail to carry great weight.; It would always be open to members of the Committee,. if they wished, to consult their Departments before a line of policy was finally adopted.The Chairman said that in his view the object to be aimed at was the centralisation of Government knowledge on Petroleum &quot;matters to bring all the knowledge possessed by the various-Government Depart-aents, so to speak, into one focus and to co-ordinate their action. He suggested that the Committee^ action might originate with the Committee or the various Departments might refer matters.which came up before them to the Committee, who should decide what executive   \ action appeared desirable.Sir Graliam Greene enquired whether it was proposed that no Department should take action without prior reference to the Committeeand..
and it was agreed that this was not intended.     Sir Frederick Black said that it was really only intended that no -two Bep^rtiaents should be engaged in dealing with the. same matter at the same time, and possibly in different ways;;She Chairman suggested that the Committee&apos; should consist of members of each Department with special knowledge on Petroleum sub-joctSj and&apos;: that would obviate the disadvantage of the, men in charge of Petroleum Supplies in the various Departments being in any way out of touch with the action of tho Committee.Sir Graham Greene said that so far as he could see nothing but advantage would accrue from the putting into effect of the scheme, but the scope of all existing Committees should be clearly defined.     He instanced the work of the Petrol Control Committee. She Chairman said it was not proposed to interfere -with the Petrol Control Committee on matters cf distribution.     He thought the co-ordinating Committee should be a small Committee of the four main Departments, and ether Government Departments interested should &quot;be invited&apos;to attend when subjects which affected them were up for discussion, and should not have permanent members.-    He also suggested that the Committee should have power to appoint sub-Committees not necessarily consisting of members of the main Committee but of persons outside the main Committee,    He also thought it would be necessary to have technical advisers and he would suggest in this capacity Sir Boverton Redwood and Professor Cadman,    He thought that the Chairman of all sub-Committoes so oreated should be pro tern members of the main Committee, that was to say while the matters for which that sub-Committee had been appointed were engaging the attention of the main Committee,     His idea was to keep the general policy in as few hands as possible.Mr.Corner suggested that a trade advisor would be useful, such as mr. Waley Cohen, and enquired whether it was proposed that such advisers should be permanent members of the Committee.The Chairman said that in his opinion the advisers should be called upon as they were required and that they should not form permanent members;   that if tho Committee needed expert commercial advice they would always bo able to refer to Mr, waley Cohen or anyone else with special knowledge.     Sir Frederick Black said that the Minister would like Professor Caiman to be one of the Ministry&apos;s representatives.2he&apos;Chairman- said&apos; that in his opinion Sir Boverton Redwood and Professor Cadman should be appointed technical advisers; they would be practically as much members of the Committee in this capacity and he &quot;thought there weue great obstacles to either of these gentlemen or any gentleman with possible trade interests acting as a representative of any Department on the Committee. He instanced the fact that it had been agreed that Admiral Slado now that he had become Vice-Chairman of the Ahglo-Persian Oil Company should not be a member of the Committee.Questions would come before the Committee affecting the interests of various Oil companies, aid on some of these occasions as a matter of principle it would be essential that the conclusions should be;farrived at by a body in no way interested in particular concerns, even: as advisors.
Mr. Corner said he appreciated this view and quite con-burred. &apos;   He hoped the Committee would consider, the depen-dence of this country, especially for Lubricating Oils., on foreign countries.Sir Graham&quot;Greene sai$ that a - Chairman would be required, ahdi as it had been suggested that the Admiralty should on thi s occasion nominate the;Chairman, he thought it Would meet with general agreement if Mr,&apos; Fretyman would undertake to act.: Sir Frederick Black.; speaking cn behalf of the Ministry, said that: he knew Dr. Addison very fully, concurred in&apos; this, and he thought that all concerned hoped that Mr. Pretyman would see his way to act as Chairman. ;7 &apos; &quot;Mr. Karwood agreed.     He then raised the point of the Committee dealing with after the war problems. - he would have to consult the Board of Trade again on that point.The Chairman stated that the Committee could not possibly be limited to war time questions;   one of its chief concerns would be possible future sources of supply, and in very many instances it. would bo quite Impossible, to draw hard and fast lines between questionB of Bupply, for War purposes and matters of general or Imperial policy.Sir Frederick Black strongly supported, reference,being made to the instance of the desire of a British Company to dis-pose of its undertaking to alien purchasers, with the result that a certain British source of supply should get into foreign hands.     In such a case momentary expediency and the larger view of policy must both be considered.Mr. Lancelot Smith mentioned the case of the present negotiations with the Shell Company, and agreed that any representations made to the Cabinet by the proposed Committee would carry infinitely more weight than when xaadcjb$r&apos; one  exert-ment&apos;altne, and in this way he thought the proposed Committee would serve a most valuable purpose.It was agreed that the following existing Committees:-The Committee for the Regulation of Petroleum Supplies The Petrol Control Committee The Admiralty Fuel QkmmitteeThe Colonial Office Interdepartmental Committeeshould be affiliated with the main co-ordinating Committee, but should retain their individuality.Sir Frederick Black said that the Colonial Office had proposed Mr. Grindle as their representative - that gentleman was an active member cf the Colonial Office Committee and wouki therefore make a valuable link between the two.It was unanimously agreed:-(1)   That a Co-ordinating Committee such as had been pro-&apos;F--/\: posed should be formed as soon as possible.. (2)   That the, Committee^ should consist cjC .representatives -V:?V&apos;y: of . the Admiralty., War Off ice, Board of Trade, Ministry of&apos; Munitions and the Colonial Office.(3)   That the number of representatives should be as follows:.-
&apos;: Admiralty - V/ar officeBoard of Trade Ministry of.Munitions Colonial Office ..&apos;. -/: Controller of Shipping (Transport Department)the India Office and the Foreign Office being invited tc send representatives as occasion re-quired.Technical Advisers 2 &quot;The Chairman pointed out. that in order to be absolutely unanimous he awaited the Board of Tradefs remarks as to their - position.with regard to after-the-war problems, and Mr. Marwood was understood to say that he personally thought it would be difficult for the.Committee not to consider after-the-war problems as such matters were in many.instances inseparable from the work they would have to do, but he would consult his Department.On the suggestion of Sir Graham Greene, it was decided to circulate a memorandum of the meeting to the representa-tives of the Departments concerned, so as to ensure agreement on the conclusion arrived at.With reference to a Secretary, it was left to the Chairman to consider and decide the matter.2 apart from.
