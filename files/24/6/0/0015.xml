SECRET.- -     WAR CABIN??.yMMORA;^IDtM: AS TO THii PROBABLE TREATMENT WHICH WOULD BE ACCORDED IN NEDTRAL PORTS WHEN THE BRITISH EMPIRE IS AT WAR TO STATE-OWNED BRITISH MERCHANT VESSELS, .   ARMED AND UNARMED.At first sight one would; say that so far as unarmed ships are concerned merchant ships owned by the State should continue to be treated in time of war as in time of peace on the same footing. as privately vowned. ships, so long as they. continued in ordinary commerce.   The question is however complicated by the possibility thatssuch ships might, if engagediin carrying munitions of war, or goods susceptible of being described as such, be considered as assimilated to warships and to be treated in the same way.   The only precedent which can be found which might assist in answering the question is that&apos; of the Russian socalled Volunteer Fleet.  The vessels composing it were, it is believed, not actually owned by the Russian Government, but they were entirely under their control and.::administered by a Government Department.:They acted in ordinary times as merchant ships Taut were- intended for warlike purposes when occasion arose and were so used at times, though not at others, during the Russo-Japanese war.   The question of their status gave rise to considerable discussion, . The Law Offic^ers (Sir R. Pinlay and Sir E. Gars on) considered that itwas- . V - .
was impossible to lay clown a general rule and that each case should he examined on Its own merits.   They reported that &quot;as the ships are in the service of the Russian Government, avid intended, if necessary, to he used for warlike purposes, we think that when they are being used for conveying muniti ons of war or any goods which are intended for the use of the belligerent Power in carrying on hostilities they would come within the definition (of warship laid down in the Suez Canal&apos; rules).   On the other hand, when they are merely conveyi ordinary merchandise in the way of general commerce, they should not be treated as warships within the definition&quot;.It is quite possible that foreign Powers would adopt a similar view with regard to merchant vessels owned by His Majesty1 s Government, and the present war has shown the wide scope -which might be given to the term &quot;Munitions of war&quot;.   It might be held to include wool and wheat as well as shells and if it were interpreted in a wide sense there might be very little employmemt possible for State-owned merchant ships in neutral ports., ;It is not easy to say whether the presence of defensive armament on board a Government-owned merchant ship would decrease the chance of her being allowed to trade with neutral ports or not.   During the present war only the Netherlands, of all countries with which the question has been raised, have declined to allow.  defensively
defensively armed ships which:are;privately owned to trade with their ports.   The Mexican Government have expressed objection, T*ut the port authorities in Mexico have not put the objection into practice.It must be remembered that neutral Powers are taking a certain risk in allowing defensively armed /merchant ships to use their ports like unarmed ships. They are dependent on the good faith of the belligerent who arms the ships&apos;and on the discretion of the ships1 masters for the avoidance of a breach of the rules of neutrality.   If the Merchant ship, after leaving the neutral port, does not confine herself rigidly to the defensive, she may compromise the neutrality of the country which she has left.   Anything therefore which would tend to shake the faith of neutrals in the purely defensive -intentions of armed merchant ships is likely to lead them only to admit such ships to their ports on the same footing as warships. -Some Governments would no doubt consider a state- owned ship as-mare deserving of confidence in this respect than a privately owned ship.   Others might possibly take the view that a Government-owned merchant ship carrying armament is harder to distinguish from a warship than a similar ship privately owned, and might on that account be more likely to exclude an armed ship if owned by a belligerent Government than if it. were owned Tsy a private individual or fimu The view of His Majesty&apos;s Government has been, and will no
: -doubt continue t &amp; be, that the presence of defensive. armament on - b card a merchant -ship makes no difference y.whatever to her. status as.a merchant ship, but this view, even if held by other Powers, cannot remove the  . considerations pointed out above which must be taken O into account  by neutral Governments who ar&apos;:et asked to admit into their ports armed merchant ships -belonging to a belligerent country. -Any ship of a belligerent country for which the &apos;[;y:-&apos;iX hybrid status of warship and merchant ship was claimed - ;V &quot;would undoubtedly be treated as a warship by neutral Powers.- -, .
