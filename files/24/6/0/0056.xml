Lord Derby.Secretary of State for War, War Office.S.W.19 th Februar&apos;1917Dear Lord Derby,With further reference to Trade exemption earns: the General Council of the above Union, which includes in its membership of 150,000,  several thousands of men employed on skilled work and as machine-men in connection with both War Work and branches of the Engineering Trade, has received from us repotts on this question.    The General Council passed a resolution; of. strong protest against the manner in which our --members have: been treated after hearing of our interview wi th (1) Representatives of the War Office (2); Representatives of the&apos;.ministryof Munitions (3) Mr. Neville Chamberlain, Direct-or g-General- of National Service .   These interviews covered the p e ri od, from th e middle of Dec embe r to the pre sen t day.We have made it quite-clear that we seek no privilege, for our members and do mot want to give them any advantage which other similar workmen do not possess..    The Provisions cf the Agreement entered into between Representatives of the Government and some other Trade Unions enable exemption cards to be supplied to workmen doing exactly the same kind of work,, under the same conditions; and in the same workshops; as / the members of this Union herein referred to.   We ask merely that men shall be treated alike irrespective of Trade Union; that either there should be no agreement giving . .. -privilegeship; some or that.. if -an agreement is to continue its provisions should be -extended to men on the ground only of the character of theywork in;which they are engaged ano not because of the Trao.e Union they belong to. - /Whatbas so far been done has roused great dissatisfaction and is:. still.causing unrest in many workshops-.// We /are re-quested to raise the matter in the House of Commons or to ask &apos; other public, action, but we prefer to ask for a decision in response to this letter.The Council is -.also of /opinion that v/e -should at once be told which State Department.we may look to for a reply on the points submitted; and we have ;fU-rth^r to ritate that exemp-tions from Military Service which; may be applied tc our members on /the grounds of the National Importance of the work they are doing must operate&quot;through the use -of.some/card or some.; f orm which - they-;, can possess as in the case of the men In -the other Trade Unionsy /; :&apos;7:XX\&apos;:XXXyXi:X*:.^Ayletter; similar; to this hag also been/sent to Dr.- C    / Addison, kinistry&apos;;of;Munitions,. and to: Mr. Seville Chamberlain,-Director General of National Service., -7/ We beg to remain,:   &apos; &apos;/-/--.&apos;-&apos;-/-.
