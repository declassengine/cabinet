EGRET,MUNITIONS OUTPUT AND RECRUITINGGrT&apos;9MEMORANDUM BY DR.ADDISON.PART   II desire to call the attention of the War Cabinet to the effect upon the output of essential munitions which is &quot;being caused &quot;by the operation of their recent decisions with regard to the calling up cf munitions workers for military service.The decisions are 9S fcllows:-I (g)(i) That, subject to tho decisions in paragraphs (a) -to-(d), the Director should proceed as in Part I cf his report &quot;by releasing for the Array all men cf 18 to 22, but scheduling as exempt from military recruiting within these ages men in those cccupgticns which are found to be cf vital national importance, i.e. men employed in the production cf steel, in the occupations covered by the trade card scheme, and in agriculture, mines and quarries, railway shops, transport work, and shipyards.2 (b) The attention cf the Director-General of National Service and the War Office should be called to the fact that paragraph 1 (g)(i) refers to &quot;occupations covered by the Trade Card Scheme,&quot; *and not to individual holders cf the card;(c) Paragraph 1 (g) (i) should be read as applying only to men who are fit for general service.In pursuance cf these decisions, notices to present them-selves for medical examination have been sent net enly tc semi-skilled gnd unskilled men, but also tc skilled men between the ages cf 18 -and 23 years who are engaged in the production and manufacture of brass, cepper, aluminium and ether important metals, tubes, sheet iron, wire, springs, bolts and nuts, chains, chemicals, aeroplanes, aeronautical woodwork, glass;    also tc men engaged in the manufacture of machinery and tools, guns, motor lorries, and in ether industries.    We have already received the most-vigorous representations on the subject from large numbers cf firms all ever the country.19th January 19175th February 1917
It therefore appears that ;:a mGre precise definition of the War Cgbinet&apos;s decisions is required, for the interpretation which - at.present is &quot;being given tc them will net cover a large part cf the industries necessary to the production of essential munitions.     I am, cf course, fully desirous of furnishing tc tho Army in the Field from munitions industries tho largest quota. cf .general service men compatible with the maintenance cf : such an output cf munitions as the Army considers essential to its success, but it is my duty to inform the War Cabinet that there is at present a danger cf a serious fall in the output cf certain essential munitions under the present interpretation of the decisions-quoted,For instance, it appears that the output cf Brass may be reduced by an amount which means the loos cf 300,000 fuses and 200,000 cartridge cases per week.Again, with regard tc copper it would appear that 8% cf the skilled men engaged in the production cf copper may be taken; the resulting loss in output would be proportionately greater than the less cf labour.     Amongst other important raw materials which may be similsrly affected are aluminium, spelter, lead and antimony.The uncertainty which at present prevails may be illus-trated by the case of aeroplanes.     The production of aircraft is threatened by the possible removal of men engaged on the manufacture cf such essential components as aluminium, tubes, highly specialised woodwork, springs, bolt^ jmd. nuts, dope, wi re,; cast ing s: and stampings, and cpt i c al ins trument s.Again., the Army is relying on cur fulfilling a large programme cf new guns and cf repair and relining cf existing guns,. for which latter demands considerable extensions cf
existing &quot;shops have tc be carried out.     Men in the existingshops and men engaged on machines for the equipment cf newshops are now being called up.     The arming of merchant shipswill also be affected.   Attached is a letter from a largefirm of gun manufacturers which illustrates this point.     Inthis connection I shcttld like to recall an agreement made betweenmy predecessor and the late Secretary cf State for War, embodiedin the following note:-.&quot;In anticipation of War Office sanction I have given in-otructiona that every gun maker in the United Kingdom is tc be kept up to maximum capacity till further notice. Additional plant must be laid down for repair.     A promise can be given that we will do our utmost tc give, gun makers material and labour. - E.S.M, 9,11.     I entirely approve. D.L1.G. 9.11&quot;.Again, large numbers of skilled chemists may be called upfrom Explosives Factories.     The Explosives Department estimatethat 15$&quot; of the works chemists are under 23 years cf age.The effect of their removal will be a reduction net only inquantity but also, it is feardd, in quality of explosives.     Itmay be pointed out that we are at the present moment making thegreatest possible effort to increase the output of explosivesin this country so as to avoid purchase in America and itstransport to this country.     The War Office released 150chemists from the Army for work in Explosives Factories in viewcf the importance of this work.PART IIOn 19th January the War Ca.binet decided:-1(d) That.50,000 semiskilled and unskilled men now engagedin munitions works should be made available for general /service by the end of January, and that the Ministry of Munitions should proceed with the measures already in v   - operation for this purpose.This decision refers to the general service men aged 18 to 30inclusive tc be released from munitions works under what is known
as the Substitution Scheme.     Comparatively few men have so far been released under this Scheme, partly because.the machinery since the Army Council Instruction of 23rd December was, issued has taken some, time tc get into operation,.    The main cause cf delay, however, has been slowness in medical examination.Up to 2nd February, according to figures supplied   by the Employment Exchanges, returns covering the names of 376,161 men had been sent to the military authorities. :   These men were tc be medically classified in order to discover those fit for general service.     On that date the number returned as having been,medically examined was 41,766 cf whom only 12,664 were placed in Class &quot;A&quot;, XA forcible illustration is furnished by the state of affairs at Barrow,     There are in this place 12,000 men to be medically examined..   A medical beard has been engaged therefor the last three weeks, and during that pericd they have examined only 1,700 men.     At the present rate of progress, the. examination of the men at Barrow will not be concluded: until some time during May,It is quite impossible for - the Ministry tc make substantial progress with the release cf the 50,000 men until they are informed which men are to be Class &quot;A&quot;, but provided a sufficient, supply of suitable substitutes is forthcoming, the Ministry see no reason why this system should not; give good and more accelerated results.:&apos;&apos;&apos;;:PART   III - &apos;       v       - .On 5th February the War Cabinet.decided;-2 (a) - The-men.to be released for the Army from munitions works under paragraph 1; (g)(i) are additional to the 50,000 men tc be released under paragraph&apos;1 (d),On the basis cf the estimate, obtained from the War Office as tothe percentage cf men who may be expected to be found fit for
genera1 service, and excluding men engaged in those muni tions industries which the War Cabinet have already decided tc treat -as essential, and the men who hold trade cards cr who are in occupations covered &quot;by the Trade Card Scheme, it appears that between the ages of 23 and 30 inclusive there are only 21,000 tc   26,000 men available for general service.Any considerable number of general service men in excess of the 50,000   &apos;Can only be obtained from munitions works:-(a) if the War Office are prepared to accept fcr general -  - service purposes men over the age of 31;   or(b) if skilled men under the age of 31 are removed from,. munitions work;    cr(c) if the age of military service is raised above 41 andthe War Office are prepared tc accept for general : -  service men over that age.C. Addison 12th February 1917.
CO P Y: - VICKERS HOUSE,BROADWAY, WESTMINSTER, S.W.10th February 1917The Secretary,Ministry of Munitions of War, Whitehall Place, S.W.Sir,We have the honour tc refer to the latest Government measure with regard to Man Power to withdraw men between the ages of 18 and 22 years from all industries without any intention of replacing the labour thus withdrawn.We have closely investigated the results which may be expected to accrue if this proposition is carried into force, and although the time at our disposal has been exceedingly short we are greatly alarmed at the disastrous consequences which will ensue should men between 18 and 22 years, of age be permanently cr temporarily with--drawn without substitution.We have been in close consultation with the whole of our Works and several of our most important sub-contractors and the opinion is absolutely unanimous, that an enormous reduction in output will immediately accrue.This reduction in output will vary, and the following is Lshort resume of the investigations made at our various Works, viz:-Barrow.     Reduction of from 30^ tc 65%.Sheffield.     Will paralyse the whole Works.Erith.     Will cripple production considerably.Crayford.     Paralyse output of Mines and Admiralty work of theextremest urgency.Beyer Peacock.    Will entirely Cripple the output as men cf thisage are vital to their getting out their work.Electric &amp; Ordnance   Accessories Co Ld.     Very serious reduction &quot;* output will resulcWoIseley Motors Ld.     Will greatly add to difficulties.
From the above ycu will gather th^t if the proposal to withdraw the men referred tc is put into effect, the results so far &apos;9s output is concerned will be most disastrous and far-reaching, and we beg respectfully to notify the Department that all promises for delivery in connection with contracts which we have now in hand are unreservedly withdrawn.We have the honour to be, Sir,Tour obedient Servants, Per TICKERS LIMITED, (sd)   y^Caillard, Directorc
