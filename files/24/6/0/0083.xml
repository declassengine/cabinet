GUNS FOR   PORTUGUESE EIYISIftH   AND AMHUNITIOII FOR:BELGIAN GUNS I IT SERVICE OF BRITISH ARMY.($ranslatibn of letter from M. Thomas&apos; to Dr.Addison.) No.11561 .1/M - PARIS.25th Feb. 191?Dear Dr.Addison,In reply to your letter of February 14th I have the honour to inform you that, as a result of a recent agree-ment arrived at.with&quot;the War Office, the French Government will deliver to the British Government, in return for 16 - 6&quot; howitzer equipments, the equipment for 12 batteries of75 m/m. guns for use with the Portuguese division which is to operate on the Western front.The 75 rn/rn guns will be supplied vith the first equipment of ammunition^ and we will be responsible for further supplies.In these circumstances, it appears that the Portuguese division will not; bring with them the 46 75 m/m Schneider guns of which you speak, and it eeems unnecessary to eonsider further the supply of ammunition for these guns.:As regards the ammunition required for the Belgian guns in the service of the British Army, I am always ready to furnish the necessary components, but, to my regret,: I;cannot undertake the assembling of them. greatI will give every assistance to the specialist officers who are to be sent to France to obtain information on the question of assembling of this ammunition, and I hope that they will be able, on their return to England, to put into action very soon the remaining.processes for the completion of this aEHnunition.Please accept, dear Dr.Addison, the assurance of my highest consideration.(Sgd)    ALBERT THOMASG.T.-82 WAP CABINET.
