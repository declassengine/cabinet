CONFIDENTIAL:-?AR CABINET.3.T.- 92. &apos;^G-EKSRn.Lv EX CHANGE J)FJ3J^ ISLAND GERIvlAN INTERNED -GIVILIANS .-- y.;-(Memorandum by Lord Newton)It is. evident that a formidable-agitation is&quot;.in -progress, backed by the whole of the North-cliff e Press, for the. exchange of all . interned British and/ German civilians,  and that con-siderable pressure will shortly be put, upon His Majesty&apos;s Government &quot;to., carry it into effect-.The -facts -are as follows:-There are interned in Germany under 4,500 British civil-ians, and in the. British Empire.about 36 5000 Germans,   Of the latter about 30,0C0 are of military age and even if un-em^loyed in military operations will.-be. available in other capacities, or as substitutes&apos;.Among the interned British subjects there are a large number of men who. are German.rather&apos;than British by parentage, sympathy, and association;    and who, -if they wore, exchanged, would in all probability return to-Germany at the conclusion, of hostilities i,   There are also other men ^ amount ing perhaps to several hundreds, who would refuse to leave Germany under any circumstances.The only justification for an exchange of so dispropor- -tionate a nature rests, upon humanitarian groundsand it was upon these grounds that. His Ma jesty rs Government consented, to the extremely disa dvantage ous&apos;exchange of a11 - civilians over - the age. of 45 years.   Since this agreement was concluded, however j the German National-Service-. Act has &quot;been . passed, under which civilians are liable for National. Service up to the age -of 60.. The advocates of total exchange base, their case upon -the alleged intolerable conditions prevailing in Ruhleben;   but there is ample evidence to show that these conditions have considerably improved, .and. that -the. hardships endured hy the. civilians, interned there do not compare -with those of military prisoners -in.other camps *   In fact a much stronger case could be made out for the exchange of many, military prisoners, who hav been in   confinement ever since the autumn of 1914cMr Gerard has upon several ,occasions informed me privately that the statements regarding Ruhleben are greatly exaggerated,&quot; and ..recently expressed the opinion to me that it would be an act of folly on the part, of His;- Majesty&apos;s Government if they. . - consented to a general exchange at the, present moment.Various pr bp o sals have been, made- with a. view to. remedy ing- -the disparity in numbers., involved&quot;&apos;-in: a general -/exchange, and of the s e the lea s t open to objection s e ems t o be the - -suggest i cn
that the balance against us should be reduced, by adding Fren civilians-;   even, however, if this were agreed to, the diffi culties of transporting many thousands of Germans by sea would remain almost insuperable.The agitsltion.;f6? general exchange is conducted by the relatives of the: interned, aided by a large section of the Press. The action of the foraer is quite intelligible, but it is;certainly not patriotlev and, in view of.the danger to the public interest involved, I venture to suggest that the question demands the early attention of the Cabinet.Whitehall Gardens, S    ., 3rd. March,  1917.
