ToV-      The Chief of the Imperial-Ctoneral - Staff,2Srd February 1917.141.-   I havo reeeiv*d following from Minister of War :- &apos; &quot;Portugal was invited to co-operate on a larger scale besides the Allies and to the extent she considered herself y  capable of doing sc.   It was decidod by tho Congress, of the Republic to give every satisfaction to this honourable invitation and tho Portuguese Government is endeavouring to make her co-operation as valuable as possible.   With this Idea in view tho effectives of the Instral division, which ,1 ordered to concentrate at Taneos, wore increased so that to-day they number 40,600 men.   Under these circumstances, and always guided by tho desire to increase our military co-operation with the Allies and also having carefully studied the military, economical, and financial possibilities of tho country, the Government of the  Republicbelieves that 2 divisions can be sent immediately to France, thoreby constituting an Army Corps, with which the /Expeditionary Force actually embarking will be incorporated. This will avoid the actual inconveniences of the present organization of.the Portuguese Expeditionary Force, which owing to its large numbers cannot be compared to an ordinary division of tho Allied armies but which at the same time does not comprise a sufficient number of troops to constitute an Army Corps the wish expressed in Prance to the Chief of Staff of the Portuguese Expeditionary Force at British G.H.Q,. of supplying the Portuguese forces with heavy artillery will be met; and I have every desire to give a satisfactory answer to your repeated question.   In order to constitute an Army Corps of 2 divisions with the existing Portuguese Expeditionary Force I shall have to add S Infantry battalions,2 groups   &apos;
2 groups of batteries of 75 millimetre Q.F. guns, 1 medium -tr^ncOa-jnortar battery and a corps heavy artillery so as to give approximately the composition givon in attached note. Rifles, guns, and: howitzers for these units will be supplied by the British Government, as per the terms of the Military Convention and also in the manner identical to that which is being followed for the troops of the existing Expeditionary Force.   Tho contingents of heavy artillery which could race ive their ins true ti on in a suitable c amp In England or France, could bo incorporated in the Portuguese Army Corps as soon as there were guns and mortars available for them. In spite of the fact that it represents the mobilization of approximately 12,000 officora and men which will increase * our co-operation to about 53,000 men or more than double the effectives of the Tancos division and more than 3 times that of an ordinary division as mobilized in the Portuguese Army. This increase and transformation of the Portuguese Expeditionary Force can be made rapidly and in such a way as to ensure continuity in the embarkation of the troops, which is being actually effected.   These considerable effectives: demand reinforcements which should not bo inferior to 5,000 officers and men per month.   Moreover, the Government of the Republic has the greatest desire to give valuable help in contingents of heavy artillery to the French Army which were, as you know, solicited by the French Government.   Finally, a -large number regular troops are absorbed by the East African campaign and the garrisons of the Portuguese Colonies.:  Under those circumstances, we cannot think,, at any rate at the moment, of sending now Expeditionary Forces to France, but this does not mean that.the Government of the Republic has ceased In any way the military training of the country.&apos; This training will, be carried.out continually so that we can face any eventuality and always/add our efforts to those of the- AlLios^
Allies to overcome the common enemy.   I bog you to tak* the neoosoary measures for giving an early answer to this despatch.   As I&apos;want the agreement of the British Government in order to increase and transform the Portuguese Expedition-ary Force, I wish to see no time lost in putting into effect this project in such form as to he useful to the 2 Allied countries.&quot;Proposed composition of Portuguese Army Corps is as follows :-2 divisions consisting of 8 infantry regiments of 3 battalion 4 machine gun companies each having 16 machine guns, 6 light and 4 medium trench mortar batteries, 6 groups each 3 batter-vies field artillery, 2 groups each 2 batteries of field howitzers, 2 divisional ammunition columns, 4 fiold companies of Engineers, 2 field telegraph sections, 6 field ambulances, 2 ambulance columns, 2 hospital columns.Corps troops.   2 squadrons cavalry, 1 group of 2 batteries of fiold howitzers, 1 heavy artillery corps 10 batteries (40 guns), one ammunition sub park, 1 artillery repair work-shop, ono section wireless, one section fortress telegraphists, 4 sections bridging train, 1 searchlight section, 1 railway battalion of 4 companies, 1 engineer park, 1 motor ambulance convoy, 1 hospital column, sanitary and dental sections, water tank, M.T. company.Administrative formations.   1 Mechanical Transport Supply Column Train, (2nd line Transport).
