P3TR0GRAD, 26-1-17.GENERAL CONDITIONS PREVAILING IN ROgMlA DURING THE MONTHS OP DECEMBER *16 &amp; JANUARY 1917,The Russians are very unpopular among all classes in Roumania and it is quite a common remark that the ; . German occupation would be preferable to the Russian. The Russians are looked uponaa&apos;barbarians and un-civilized/ and in certain places they have certainly earned this opprobrium, chiefly owing to the ease with which they have been able P to procure wine in large quantities..   After more than two years enforced . abstinence the troops have got out of hand when wine has been found in plenty, as it is in many places in Roumaniac     A good deal of private property has been, spoilt or destroyed, and even if this has been acciden-tal the Roumanians have not been slow in making as much of it as possible.The Russians heartily dislike the Roumanians and I have never heard a Russian say a good wcrd for them. They consider them the cause of the whole Roumanian debacle,, their fighting qualities are openly derided and any loss of moral among the Russian troops is attri-buted to contact with the Roumanian Army.CPS. ROUMANIAN.Por the best part of two months I have mixed with the peasant class of Roumania and am certain that they have the making of excellent soldiers.     They are simple-living, hard-working, of excellent physique, and for those who know their language easy to deal with.     They are excellent marchers,     1 was with General VOITOYANO at CAMPINA when his force retreated .   from the PREDEAL PASS and I saw his troops after a march of what was said to be over 45 kilometres without rest or proper food; although march discipline was non-existent, nevertheless the troops were still plodding along, and as far as I know marched all that night towards PLOESCI.     The officers are useless,, and beneath contempt.     They never seem to be with their men when conditions are unpleasant.     During a whole night of retreat, with roads blocked with trans-port and guns between CAMPINA and PLOSSCI, I saw only two Roumanian officers, whereas there was work neces-sitating the presence of every available officer. All this transport, amounting to 700 carts, traa, 1 believe, captured by the Germans at daybreak.     The large towns such as JASSY or BERLAD are now over-flowing with Rouianian officers, smartly turned out, powdered and painted, and doing nothing: some of them are no doubt on leave, but the majority of them are absent from their units.    With such an example 0 one can hardly blame the common soldier if he doesthe same, and the villages are full of Roumanian soldiers doing nothing.     I believe an order wasrecently issued calling on all Roumanian officers and .. soldiers absent from their units to rejoin at once, ; v cancelling all leave, and instructing all ranks on! -------....... medicalSAL,fault of the anians who Id not destroy
laediCal certificate, to report&quot; at once for examination.andthe;men:ICIPLIM.The officere treat their men like &quot;dogs, havi ho redpect for- their officers.     The Roumanian  . Army with its present officers is, I believe, worse than&apos;- uselessj; but with other&quot; ;officer:s and; a stiff ening of Russian troops Would be excellent. .   Self-inflicted wouiids are. not uncommon.. .. Russian troops- have suffered from the&apos; continual  . nedessity: for retirement^ due usually to the unexpected retirement of a Roumanian force at a; or it ical moment and-the lack of heavy guns.     Their morale is still in general -good, but unless the whole wine supply is eff ect-ively destroyed;it may soon be&quot;adversely affected.   I -was surprised to hear from a nurse at one of the advanced hospitals that self-inflicted wounds were very common, chiefly among the young soldier.Among the- Roumanians march discipline is very &quot;bad. Transport moves along the road in&apos;any formation, block-ing everything, .and.no one Seems to take any notice unless it immedi.ately affects his-movements,-     Stragglers are numerous...  Transport, carts &quot;are often, though loaded&apos; up, used, by officers and men.     Discipline as we. know it hardly;;seems to- exist,;.-..&quot;. The Russians have- a lot of showy discipline that may or may not be beneficial, such as standing to the salute all the time a soldier;speaks to a senior, halting and facing to the front when a General passes, etc, but real. dis ci pi in e ; i s. 1 ax,   . 3?at i gue part i e s, unl ess under an officer (and he a-martinet)do little work; 11. CO! s, - with few except ions, on&apos; such duties are. as slack&quot;as the men; officers, when their work is uniri-teresting, are-casual and.do hot insist on getttrig a fair amount.of work from.their-men.     Any little excuse : is seized;for stopping work, even though it iaay be of vital importance, if it is uninteresting.     The cause of this is a failure to understand the importance of work which is not immediately connected with the actual fighting.    Ho one can-accuse the Russians of want;df-the highest f ighting.qualities, but on;-such work as nec-. essitates continuous uninteresting labour their; sense of duty is practically, nil..     There is also none of that healthy. compet it ion whi ch exists in every part of. our   n1 ; Army,   -. The idea of trying to complete - a task quicker than another, detachment is inexplicable to the Russian soldier. .    &apos; Xh^yy/^Z - ..&quot;&apos;: - ;-.;&apos;;.-1. have travelled for.days both on Roumanian and . Russian RedvCross trains (all Roumanian roiling&apos;stock) . and the arrangements.-are-primitive and;bad,     A&apos; train . consists of a number of wagons-each containing 12 .stretehers-.on. w.ooden frames in &quot;four groups of three tiers. The&apos;stretchers are so narrow that it is impossible for even a,medium-sized man to: lie flat on his back in corn-fort, and are so short that only the smallest men could lie straight on them.     There is a stove in each wagon so that they can be kept.fairly warm.     Ventilation is very.-bad/as&quot;air- can only be obtained by opening the sliding doors at the si.de, which are the &quot;full height of the wagon.- &quot;Officers&apos; waggons have better mattressesand
NATION-.and blankets than the men, but all is very rough. As there is no connection between wagons the nurses, who are few in number, can only visit wagons at halts. There i s an orderly to each t-agon, -but as far as I could see they- were quite untrained and could only carry out the ordinary menial work.     Cleanliness was impos sible under these conditions,   - Bed pans, . dirty dressings, etc. etc. were emptied on to the  : -.raiIway line .&apos;which was ;everywhere a veritable latrine and - us ed as such by all troops t ravelling (an araputate d leg was left on the line at.one station for hours). Entrails of slaughtered animals were everywhere and the smell in damp weather was disgusting.     Dead horses lie everywhere, the dogs and pigs being the only scavengers.     I never once saw a latrine trench in Roumania,. and the troops use the precints of the sta-tion, their billets and the edges of roads or wherever suits them.   I have not travelled on. a Roumanian Red Cross Train with wounded, so cannot say how their work is done, but my conversation with the officers on an empty train bound for Bucharest, on which I travelled for four days, did not leave at all a pleasant impression of.their practicability or of their sense of duty to their patients. .. The Russians on the other hand are keen and hard-working, and the Sisters of Mercy are splendid, doing their utmost under indescribable conditions of diffi-culty and discomfort.     Even they, however, do not seem to realise the necessity for cleanliness where and when it is possible.     There is one outstanding exception to the above insanitary arrangements, and that is the Hospital Train of the Empress marie Eeodorovna.     This train is a Russian built hospital train with adjustable-wheels for the change of-gauge from Russian to Roumanian railways.    I have seen it often and know how well organ-ized and equipped it is.     It is a mobile hospital and is always the nearest to the enemy, transporting.the wounded and sick, after they have .been attended to, into the Red Cross trains above mentioned.     This train has a staff of highly-trained Russian doctors and nurses, and is&quot; known to all as the &quot;Oasis in the Desert&quot;, as it is not only as. hospital that it is used, dealing often with over 000 cases daily, but as a moss for all who have no food. The last time I saw it. it was entirely feeding 40 Roumanian railway employees at MAHAS358TI (a large junction which was being evacuated and foodlees).   Though this train is often bombed and under shell fire, Staff Rotmeister LADIZHINSKY, the commander of the train, and his staff never leave till the,last possible moment immediately preceding the demoli-tion of the station and the withdrawal of the troops.ROMANIANS.&apos;,- I was only present at one; examination of prisoners by the Roumanians, when General VOITOYANO personally interrogated an officer and 17 Austrians in a bunch;   the examination was Very perfunctory, and only a very few simple;questions were:put,     I do not know whether any;/ mere detailed examination took place later as I had to leave at once, but from the -general disorganization and.: muddle prevailing at the moment I should think it unlikely. .^&apos;:-^/\/m m. -        y .    &apos;    :,A., :&apos;&apos;;&apos;&quot;S^:-&apos;;/v &quot;v&apos;.: :^ The
NTRSNGHIKGbiiaincAirDNS...The Ruosiaris are exceedingly slack in such mattery and leave prisoners unexamined for long periods, and then do not thoroughly thresh out matters.I had no Chance of inspecting Roumanian work..The Russians are very had at entrenchingo     I have seen lines which have been dug in rear, to be taken up on ret irement, with hoc ommunioat ion trenches  &apos; whatsoever ;from the rear, and no cover for miles under which -troops could be relieved or sent up by day in support.     I have spoken to Russian officers on the sub j ect; and they have always said that it --was a matter;-. of &quot;no time&quot;, but the lines I saw/were well in rear and considered completely ready for,occupation: the Russians do not yet realize the necessity for good trench work, and I hear that their front line trenches are often only three feet deep and frequently single . line.    As far as I can hear they never worked at improving trenches when in them.     The siting of the trenches I saw v/as good.     Barbed wire was put up and sandbags used when available ,The railways are in an undescribable state of chaos, due to the transference of thousands of wagons to the rear./. Stations are blocked; with them, loaded and empty-.     Trains of stores urgently wanted are lost and even if found Would probably be impossible to move. S Qffie : s t at ion-mast ers are --- kn own t o. b e Ge rmanophile and do all in their power to make things x?orse.   &apos; Accidents, the work/of German agents, are/centinually happening, and with, the pre sent ; jpint; Ru ssian.and/Roumanian control will go on happening.-.    Larger stations have Russian /and Roumanian;Station Commandants who    . are alv/ays at cross-purposes/     Trains are suddenly; despatched with no warning whatsoever and soldiers are left behind in scores,     A journey of 60 kilo-metres may take 4 hours or 24 hoursc     I travelled on a Red.Cross train full of wounded from TECUCI to BERLAD - 60 kilometres: it took 25. hours-.     The train, with no food on board, was sent to TECUCI-, v/here. there were special feeding arrangements for : troops, to a spot 5 miles distant and kept there for 12 hours, for apparently no reasonv    $he water supply//, often, ran short and engines were held up for want of - it and had to be sent off in groups to distant stations :.to water-, thereby occupying the line and stopping traffic .     On the / IAltfCA &apos;- BRAILA line; 3 accidents happened in. a few days, at another point a Russian Red Cross train overtook and wrecked a goods -train and itself-, the driver having leaped off and die-appeared in the darkness; this accident also cut off the iemolition;; train in rear; and / the /whole lot fell into the enemy-s hands a short time after. Russian soldiers were then put On the engines and accidents/ceased,;on this branch.     The further north wagons are removed the greater does the congestion become, it being impossible to run &quot;them over on to, the Russian broad gauge line.     There is only one way of improving matters; all unnecessary wagons should be run off temporarily laid; lines constructed where-, ever there is a block.     This would free the lines for&apos; troop
troop train movements-, which, at present are pract- .. ically impossible, the&apos;&apos; troops all marching by road,. Railway control.must also, be either totally RUssian V or Roumanian, preferably the former.     Under present conditions, it is obvious-,that the German agent has a free run.     There is no sort.of. order on the stations,. - all the station buildings are continually.packed with troops and refugees, awaiting trains which may turn-up in one hour but which often arrive a day late.. &apos;-The most highly-trained railway staff .in the world ,&apos; could not work under such conditions.     The offices are packed-with enquiring officers and men. .  Their telephones are often even used for-non-railway work,., and they live in a continual state of chaos.     The. stations obviously cannot be cleared of the crowds until the trains run correctly and to some sort of timing.     The troops referred to above are not formed bodies but soldiers going on or returning from leave, under no officer and therefore under no sort of disci- . pline, and as far/as .the railway authorities are con-cerned can only be treated a9 individuals.     There is no limit to the capacity of the trains, which are packed from floor to roof, both-the latter and the engines themseltes being covered with passengers. There is of course no sale of tickets, no checking of passes, and here again the German agent can and does travel unsusoected./ .5ADS.Since the. railways have become- congested the roads have had to take practically the whole of the Army transport as well as the movement of troops.   .: They are nOw in a state that beggars description; all the surface has gone and in most districts&apos; they are now either a sea of mud, hiding holes that ruin cars and creak cart-whtels, or in drier weather they   -resolve themselves into a series of mounds and hollows of loose gravel and earth.     Derelict lorries, cars and carts are often met with, dead horses-line the roads, and all types of transport can only move slowly,.; and with difficulty..    Through villages the roads are;/ worse than elsewhere,, and many, roads that formerly . were excellent for motors are how only passable for . . country carts .-.    Repair is almost -everywhere impossible, as metal cannot be transported and labour is. unobtain- ;. able.     The roads in MOLDAVIA were better than those   -.,-/ in the south round BRA.ILA and BUZEU, as tbey were .&apos;metalled, ;but they are now practically destroyed and ,. the loose metal makes them almost worse for horse   -/-; / transport.-- - .. .?LUEKCBRoumania is obviously a happy hunting ground for . Austrian.and Turkish agents and spies,     Her population is so mixed that on the Transylvanian frontier and in &apos;/, DOBRUDJA Austrian and Turkish agents can work undis-^ turbed and;with/little chance of detection.     In addi- , tion to this^  as a nation she is so young that deep and widespread patriotism can hardly yet be one of her national traits and, - worst misfortune of all, - she:/, started life rich through no effort of her own.     Sheentered
entered the War with ideas of becoming richer,: with her national eyes only on Transylvania; she had no idea beyond that, no ideas of fighting for a just cause.     Half her population, at least her educated classes, are Germanophlles.     She did not want to fight&apos;Bulgaria and when, after a brilliant burst into Transylvania, she was driven back and still back -she collapsed as a nation and is now only a country populated by a people who desire to see finished a war they never wished for.     That, I believe,, is Roumania today, - not the peasant Roumania but the Roumania of the rich.    &quot;This is the ground the German knows so well ho?/ to useii and he is using it now. His agents are everywhere.     A small part of the Roumanian Army is still fighting, but a large Russian force protects her from Germany, and all the while she prefers Germany.     Is it strange that the Russians find things difficult, - railways more disorganized than they need be, telephonic communication often almost impossible at urgent moments?     These things can point to but one cause, - Rournania&apos;s desire for War has cooled down, damped by the German offensive and by German agents.     The following few facts may shew the half-hearted way Roumania is making war:1.     The station-master at JASSY is a German.2.       &quot; rt -..&quot;&quot;.&apos;     &quot; tiATRA is an Austrian.3.     The manager of the mill at GALATZ was a Groatwith loudly-voiced German sympathies, who toldme   he was a German. 4.     The factories (including shell)/ stores, etc. inBUCHAREST were handed over intact to the enemy. 5,     The shell factory at CRAIOVA, with 2,500 shells,was left ready for immediate work . 6.     Unless a special Mission of British Officers haddestroyed the oil-fields, the factories at BRAILA,these would have undoubtedly have been handedover intact to the enemy.1, 2,  4 and 5, I heard many&apos; times repeated, 3 and 6 I am sure of from personal knowledge.I left Roumania on 19th January1917.(Sd.)
