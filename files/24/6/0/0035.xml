Secret.The Fourth Report of the Director-General of National Service to the War Cabinet.I submit, for the consideration and approval of the War Cabinet,- ,(a) A draft of a proposed Order whereby the trades included in the Schedule to the Order will be restricted by preventing the employers in those trades from engaging further male labour between the ages, of 17 and 61 (both exclusive) without my consent ;*and:   . (b) A proposed amendment of the Defence of the Realm . Regulation 41a, whereby every person who employs -one or more male persons of 16 years or over shall keep a register in the form attached, and make me returns from the register when required.(A.) The Proposed Order.The effect, of the proposed Order will be to prevent an employer making additions to his male staff, and will prohibit him from replacing any volunteer who may leave his service, and from filling up any other vacancy from the general labour pool. It should, therefore, add considerably to the reserves from which labour can be drawn for the essential trades.It is contemplated that the Schedule may be added to from time to time as may be found necessary, and further restric-tions will be considered in the future so as to maintain the current of labour in the required directions. .It will be observed that Clause 1 of the Order enables an employer to take back any of his former employees who are no longer required for military purposes, when he has promised to do so.-        ^:--V:y, &apos;     . N.S.R.4.February 19th, 1917..49-1 A
A copy of the proposed Order is annexed, and I ask that it may be approved, and that the War Cabinet will direct the Ministry, of Munitions (or some other competent Government Department) to make the Order.(B.)-The proposed amendment of the Defence of the RealmRegulation 41a.The proposed amendment of the Regulation is necessary in order to ensure that additional male labour will not be engaged in the restricted trades in the Schedule to the Order referred to above or any extension thereof. The form of register is practically identical with that already required to he kept by all controlled establishments, and will give essential informa-tion for the . purpose of determining the sources from which labour may he drawn, if necessary, for reinforcing the essential ; industries.A draft regulation making the formal amendments required in Regulation 41a is annexed to this Report, together with an explanatory Note by Sir Arthur Tilling. vI request that the War Cabinet will give me authority to have the amending regulation placed before the next Council.NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN.February 19th, 1917.

Defence of the Realm Regulation.AMENDMENTS 01? REGULATION 41a AS TO RETURNS OE PERSONS EMPLOYED.Amendments of the Defence of the Realm Regulations are effected by means of verbal additions and substitutions, so that when reprinted, as they are monthly, they can be printed in the amended form. The consequence is that the regulation actually making the amendments is not very intelligible.Under Regulation 4lA as it stands at present, employers in Great Britain have to keep up-to-date lists  (1) of males of military age employed by them, giving - separate particulars as&quot; to each person employed;;.(2) of the number of females and males not of military age employed by them, giving only the total number;(3) of males of military age employed by them but only casually employed. ,..Exceptions are made for cases where the particulars required by the returns are&apos;already required to be kept, e.g., controlled, establishments, collieries, &amp;c.It is now necessary, for the purposes of the Director-General of National. Service, to make these returns, cover, not only employed persons of military age, but also all male employed persons who are of the age of 16 or over, and further to extend the obligation to make returns to employers in Ireland. This will be the effect of the amendments now proposed. The practical result will be : (1) That no difference at all will be made and no extra labour given, in controlled establishments (which now include most of the big employers: of labour), as the form in which the returns are to be given is the form in which returns are now required by the Minister of Munitions: - -(2) That other employers (a) will have to return not only males of military age, but also any males of 16 years or over who are employed by them; and
(b) will have to make a return for the first time, if they are employers in Ireland, and elsewhere, if they do not now employ a man of military age, but do employ a male of 16 years or over; and((?) will have to add certain particulars to the return which are not now required. These particulars are particulars as to the previous occupation of a man engaged since August 1914, his degree of skill, and the work on which he is usually employed.
DRAFT.Defence of the Realm Regulation.Regulation 41a shall be amended as follows. :-1. In subsection (1) the words :&quot; the United Kingdom&quot; shall be substituted for the words &quot;Great Brifeiin.&quot;2. The words &quot; of 16 years or over&quot; shall be substituted for the words &quot;between the ages of 18 and 41&quot; wherever they occur except in paragraph (3) of subsection (iii), where . the words &quot; all other male persons of 16 years or over&quot; shall be substituted for the words &quot;male persons not being between the ages of 18 and 41.&quot;  :   . .&apos;3. In the description of Statement No. II. in subsection (1) the word &quot; female &quot; shall be inserted before the word .&quot; persons &quot; and the words &quot; of 16 years or over &quot; shall be substituted for the words &quot; of either sex &quot; and the words &quot; and who are not required to be included in Statement No. I.&quot; shall be omitted.4! At the beginning of paragraph (c) of subsection (2) the words &quot;In Great Britain&quot; shall be inserted before the words &quot;he shall,&quot; and the following paragraph shall be /added at the end of subsection (2):- .&quot; (d) He &quot;shall, if and when required by the Director-General of National Service either by general or special notice, furnish to the Director-General a! true copy&apos;of any such statement as revised for the time being.&quot; 75.
