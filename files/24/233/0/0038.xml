Supplementary Agreement with Government of India               relating to Iron and Steelo       Note by the President of the Board of Trade.     I circulate herewith, for the information of mycolleagues, a note on the supplementary agreement withthe Government of India relating to iron and steel.     The letters contained in Annex B will be published on Thursday, the 13th October, with the other agreements,but it is essential that no public reference should bemade to the existence of the note initialled at Ottawaon August 18th, from which Annex A is an extract.W.R.ard of Trade,  10th October, 1932.
        SUPPLEMENTARY AGREEMENT WITH GOVERNMFIDTT OF INDIA                  RELATING TO IRON AND STEEL.     It will be recalled that the formal agreement concluded at ottawa with the Government of India did not include thearrangements which had been discussed and, so far as therespective Governments were concerned, substantially agreed inconnection with the importation of galvanised sheets into India.The position reached at the end of the Conference afterdiscussions in which the representatives of the United Kingdomsteel industry took part, is set out in the annexed extract(Annex A) from a note which was initialled by representativesof each Delegation.   It was not possible at that stage to place the matter on a more formal basis pending discussion with theIndian iron and steel interests who were not represented at ottawa.   Since the conclusion of the Conference, there have been further discussions in London between the representatives of theiron and steel industries in the United Kingdom and India, atwhich an agreement has been reached which should enable the contemplated tariff arrangement to work out satisfactorily inpractice.   The agreement between the two Delegations wasthereupon concluded by an exchange of letters which are annexed(Annex B) and which it is contemplated to publish at the sametime as those parts of the agreements which have hitherto beenwithheld from publication.     As regards the terms of the agreement, galvanised sheetsimported into India are at present subject to a duty ofRs. 30 a ton under the Steel Industry Protection Act, plus anadditional duty imposed by notification which varies accordingto the price of imported sheets - at present it is Rs. 37 a ton -plus a surcharge, the total duty being at present Rs. 83.12.0a ton.   There is no differential in favour of the UnitedKingdom.
           In return for the continued free entry of Indian iron and      steel into this country, the Indian Delegation, in addition to      recommending the application of preference to the unprotected      classes of iron and steel - this is provided in the main      agreement -, were prepared to lower the duty on British sheets      made from Indian semi-finished material to Rs. 30 a ton, the      figure fixed by the Steel Industry Protection Act, which they      regarded as a minimum.   They were not prepared, however,  on the      basis of present prices, having regard to the interest of the      consumer, to raise the duty on foreign sheets above the present      figure.   The problem thus was to find an intermediate rate of      duty to be applied to British sheets made of any semi-finished      material low enough to enable such sheets to compete with foreign      sheets, but not so low as to make the use of Indian material by      the United Kingdom sheet manufacturers uneconomic.   (Provision      for the export to this country of Indian semi-finished material      was regarded by the Indian Delegation as essential, and the only      alternative to the erection of further finishing plant by the      Indian steel interests).   It is hoped that, on the basis of      present prices, the proposed rate of Rs. 53 a ton will meet the      caBe.   The scheme provides for a high degree of flexibility in      the event of price changes.           It may be added that galvanised plates and sheets      represented approximately one third by weight of Indian imports      of iron and steel from the United Kingdom in the year ended&apos;      March 1931.   This is a trade previously held almost entirely      by the United Kingdom but recently foreign competition has been      very keen and has reduced prices to an unremunerative level.      It is hoped that the new scheme, which is accepted by the      industry here, will result in prices recovering to a remunerative      level.

EXTRACT PROM NOTE INITIALLED BY THE UNITED KINGDOM AND      INDIAN DELEGATIONS AT OTTAWA ON AUGUST 18th,  1932.               *******     Under the Agreement the United Kingdom Government areundertaking to continue after the 15th November free entry to all classes of Indian goods covered by the Import DutiesAct.  While, of course, the Agreement will continue in forceunless it is denounced after six months1 notice, themaintenance of free entry for iron aiid steel during a longer period than six months from the date of the agreement hasalways been regarded on both sides as part of an understanding which would provide for satisfactory conditions in regard tothe tariff treatment of galvanised sheets on importation intoIndiao  The conditions which have been discussed and whichwould be satisfactory to the United Kingdom Government arc asfollows     On the basis of present selling prices the duties wouldbe adjusted as follows -     Rupees 30 per ton on United Kingdom sheets made from indian sheet bars.     Rupees 53 per ton on United Kingdom sheets made fromany sheet bars.     Rupees 83 per ton on foreign sheets.     In the event of a furtner fall in  the price of continental sheets, the Government of India would, as soonas it was satisfied that a fall in price had in fact occurred,impose  promptly by notification and without an enquiry bythe  Tariff Board an additional duty of rupees 10 per ton,it being understood that if the imposition of this  increasedduty resulted in an increase in the price of sheets in India,it would be open to the Government of India to remove theadditional duty.                           -3-

9 *) F)6(6Indian Delegation,  Imperial Economic Conference,           Ottawa.      India House,        Aldwych,   tf.C.2.22nd September,  1932.From:  Sir George Rainy, K.C.S.I., K.C.I.E.,         Delegate for India to the Imperial           Economic Conference, 1932.To:    Sir Horape Wilson, K.C.B., C.B.E.,         Chief Industrial Adviser to His Majesty1 s           Government,                Board of Trade, London, S.W.1.Sir,     When the Agreement between the British and IndianDelegations was made at Ottawa it was found necessary to postponea final settlement of certain questions relating to iron andsteel.  By Article 1 of the Agreement His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom undertook to continue after the 15thNovember free entry to all classes of Indian goods coveredbbythe Dnport Duties Act.  It was clearly understood,  however,-between the two Delegations that the continuance of the free entry of Indian iron and steel for a longer period than sixmonths from the date of the Agreement was dependent on the settle-ment of satisfactory conditions in regard to the tariff treatmentof galvanised sheet on importation into India.  At the same timean understanding was reached that the conditions which would be satisfactory to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom were as follows:-(l)     On the basis of present selling prices, the duties on    galvanised sheet in the Indian tariff to be adjusted as    follows:-       Rs. 30 per ton on sheet made in the United Kingdom from                Indian sheet bar.       Rs. 53 per ton on sheet made in the United Kingdom from                other sheet bar.       Rs. 83 per ton on sheet not made in the United Kingdom.(2)     In the event of further reductions in the price of sheet    imported into India and not made in the United Kingdsw., the    Government of India, as soon as they are satisfied that a    fall in prices had in fact occurred, would, without an    enquiry by the tariff Board, take prompt and effective action    to meet the situation by the imposition of an additional duty.    The amount of the additional duty would not necessarily be    limited to the amount of the price reduction actually made,    but would be sufficient to make clear the intention of the    Government of India to maintain prices.(3)     Each Government would remain at liberty to take
*J M n    appropriate measures to prevent sales at unfair prices    &quot;by the manufacturers in the other country,  or to check  an    unnecessary increase in prices against the  consumer &quot;by  a    combination of manufacturers in both countries.(4)    These arrangements to remain in force until action is    taken by the Government of India following  the next    statutory Tariff enquiry in India into the  Iron and Steel    Industry.2.     The Indian Delegation are now prepared to undertake  on behalf of the Government of India, that proposals will be placed before the Indian Legislature for the adjustment of the duties on galvanised sheet at the rates set forth in clause (l) above, and for obtaining the powers which are  necessary to carry out the intention of clauses (2).and (3).  I have been authorised by my colleagues of the Indian Delegation to make this communication to you, and I have now the  honour to request that you will Inform me whether the terms of the understanding have been correctly  stated in this letter.                           I am, Sir,                              Your obedient Servant,(Signed)  GEORGE RAINY.
