 ,ft)OUMENT  IS.THE.PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT). SET.                                               COPY NO.   ^P.545(32)                        CABINET,                      THE   NEEDS    TEST.              Memorandum hy the Mini s ter  of ^ Lao our. 1.   During recent weeks I have received  an increasing volume of evidence from responsible sources that  large numbers of our  supporters in Parliament and in  the country are uneasy as to certain  aspects of the administration of the needs test in regard to claimants  for Transitional Payments.   Complaints  are made of  disparities  between the practice of Public  Assistance Authorities and resentment is also caused by  the application of Poor Law standards, particularly in regard to  the treatment of savings,  to  classes of persons  with  good industrial records who, owing to continued  unemployment and  the operation  of the  rule which limits insurance benefit to 25 weeks in a year, have exhausted  their right to &quot;benefit from the Insurance Fund. 2.   I had hoped  that we might have  been  able to defer any action until we had received and considered the  report  of the Royal Commission and were in  a position to bring  forward comprehensive legislation dealing not only with the Unemployment Insurance Fund but also with  the whole question of the  relief  of the ahle-hodied  employed. .     But I am satisfied from the inquiries  I have made and the  vidence that is  reaching me that some  immediate action is necessary  o meet the present position and. to  satisfy the demands of our  own  upporters.   Otherwise there is grave  danger that the whole principle  f the Needs Test will  be imperilled and  that we may run the risk of  osing the whole  of the large saving amounting to some  15,000,000  hich has  been secured hy it.     Transitional payments will in any  oase cost  55 millions next     end we cannot therefore afford  any expensive changes, hut  I
believe  that we  can, at comparatively small cost, make some concessions which will satisfy the bulk of our own supporters andwill not prejudice the larger measures which we shall have to takeafter we have received and considered the Report of the RoyalCommission..5.   There are throe matters on which I think we should be well advised  to take  action at once.   They are -              (l)  disability pensions,              (2)  workmen&apos;s compensation;              (3)  savings.6.   With regard to disability pensions, I have been strongly urged by the British Legion to take steps to secure that theyshould not be taken into account in the assessment of need.   Onthe whole the Public Assistance Committees have acted reasonablybut there are discrepancies of treatment,  and there would be strong political support in all parties for a provision that inall cases a minimum proportion of disability pensions should be disregarded in the assessment of need.     If  this is done,  I think that similar action should be takenin regard to workmen&apos;s compensation.   The case for this is not so strong but it would give a good deal of satisfaction to moderate Trade Union opinion.7.   The question of savings is more difficult.   On the onehand it may be regarded as paradoxical  that an applicant with 100 or  so of liquid assets is &quot;in need&quot; and entitled to bemaintained more or less indefinitely by the community.    On theother hand there is widespread opposition  to the enforcement of the ordinary Poor Law  practice in this  matter in the caseof the decent working  people,  of whom the  great majority of the claimants for transitional payments are  composed,  and  a strong
fueling that there should be a more uniform treatment of thi6matter in the practice of the Public Assistance Authorities.     Also I have received many representations alleging that  a harshtreatment of savings  is a deterrent of thrift and that theimprovident man who has never saved anything can obtain full  paymentwhilst the thrifty men may get nothing until he has exhausted nearly all his savingso   I do not subscribe to the view that thrift  Bhouldbe maintained at the  public expense, but evidence is reaching me  thatthe position in many  areas is causing deep resentment among  the verybest type of workpeopleo8*   There are two other  matters which are causing much feeling inthe country   They are            (i) equalisation in scales of relief;           (ii) family income.9C   The lack of uniformity in scales arises from the differences inthe scales which are  in operation in the various areas covered by thePublic Assistance Committees and is inherent in the present  system.The agitation on family income arises from the Poor Law Practice  of taking the whole income of the household into account in the determination of need,  a  practice which in general has much  to commendit, but which in certain cases, such, for example, where a young  girlin employment is called upon to maintain an unemployed father orbrother, is causing a good deal of feeling among the male members ofthe household.  This  question, however, bristles %with. difficulties, andtogether with the question of scales, forms the main foundation onwhich the present system  is based.  I would hesitate, therefore,  totake action with ut the most serious consideration and before havingthe advice of the Royal Commission.  I think it will be sufficient asa temporary measure to meet the present position  to deal with thethree questions of disability pensions, workmen&apos;s compensation aridsavings, and that we  oannot do more now without running the  danger of destroying the whole  basis of the Needs Test and seriously prejudicing the ultimate solution of  the problem.
^10.    I  suggest  therefore  that  legislation should be  introduced  as  soon as possible  to amend  the Order in Council  so that  in  the assessment  of need in the case of claimants  for  transitional payments  -       (a)  not more than  5C  per cent, of disability pension           should  be taken into account;       (b)  not more than  50  per cent, of workmen&apos;s           compensation should be taken into account, and       (c)  in regard to realisable assets  (other than house           property occupied by the applicant) which are normally           taken into  account, the first  25 of value shall be           disregarded, and  the value up to  300 shall be taken           into  account at an assumed income of 1/- per week in           respect of  each complete  25*   In the case of house           property occupied by the applicant, the rental value           Bhould  be taken into account.  11.    I  propose  that the operation of the Bill should be  limited  to  the period expiring  next June, when many of the  existing provisions  of  the Unemployment  Insurance Acts expire and  before which legislation dealing with the whole problem must be  passedo  12.    It  will  no doubt  be  contended that all these concessions  will have to be  extended to the ordinary recipients of Public  Assistance, but  I am satisfied  that we can justify some differences  in the treatment of  applicants  for transitional payments who are in  the  main of a  different class though there is some overlapping.  Our  experience indicates also that those Authorities who wish to  be economical  with their own money will  continue to be so and that  those who wish to be generous or even extravagent do not wait for  the  excuse  of  a  lead from  any Central Department.  13.    in the last few days I have heard  that we may expect to have  the  Report  of  the Royal Commission within two or three weeks.  I  have reason to believe  that the Report will make far-reaching  proposals on the question  of relief for  able-bodied
c unemployed,  &quot;both insured and uninsured.   These proposals will have to be seriously considered and we should refuse to be hurried into a  decision  upon thorn.   But  I understand that on the three points mentioned in paragraph 5  above  their recommendations will in fact be on  the lines of the proposals I  make in paragraph  10. 14c   On several grounds  I  should have  preferred  to incorporate my specific proposals  in  a  Bill,  thus  showing clearly the  limits of the  modifications I  propose  to the  existing  Order in Council,  But I am told  that  this  method might be embarrassing to  many  of  our supporters who  might be  disinclined to vote  against  amendments increasing either the  range  or the  extent  of  the  concescions0  Also I am told  that  such  a  Bill might occupy a  disproportionate amount of Parliamentary time,      I  should propose  therefore to  introduce  a Bill  taking parsersto make regulations on these three  points, and to  say that inmaking  the regulations I  should pay attention to  the recommendationsof the Royal Commission.   (if  the Report is published before the debate I should make it clear that my regulations will in fact bebased on the recommendations of the Commission on  these points).     I should then resist any amendment either to  take powers overa wider field9 or designed to  secure that the regulations go further than the Report  of the Commission,,   It  will obviously be helpful  indealing with our own supporters to be able to quote the authority ofthe Commission&apos;s Report.15.   If my  colleagues agree,  I should propose to  annouce our intention as soon as  possible after the meeting of the House.Lleanwhile the action I  am taking to  enforce compliance with thegeneral proviaionsof  the  law  in the  few areas which are  still defiant,will  not be affected  by the present  proposals.  This  will  mean the
early supersession of the County Council  of Durham whohave deliberately passed a resolution declining  to obey  the lawthe voting being entirely on political lines.     To actotherwise would make  our proposals  appear to be  merely a surrender to organised agitation and revolt; we  could notenforce the means test anywhere,  and the  general reputation of the Government would be seriously damaged.
