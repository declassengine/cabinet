I circulate for the information of my colleagues the latest weekly&apos; reports from theLocal Governments in India.                                                                         S.  H.      INDIA OFFICE,   26th September 1932.Government of India.   The Bengal Government have reported separately a very serious terrorist outrageat Chittagong.   The Government of India have  already arranged  for the immediate despatch of sis additional  battalions  in view of  Bengal reports that outrages wereanticipated shortly.Delhi.   There is nothing important to report.  Section 3 :  arrests, nil;  total detained, 3.Section 4 :  fresh  orders, 4;  total to date against whom  orders  are in force, 38.Convictions to date for contravening orders, 10.Bombay.   Mr. Gandhi&apos;s fast, which  commenced  on  the 20th September, and the ensuingnegotiations between the caste Hindu leaders and the leaders of-the Depressed classes are the chief  topics of interest.   Partial hartals were held in Bombay city and in afew district towns to mark the beginning of the fast, but no untoward incidents have so far been reported. District reports indicate that the situation is generally regardedcalmly, but with  interest.  A certain  amount  of propaganda for  the  removal ofuntouchability is being  carried on.   There is little Congress activity.  An  instanceof toddy tree cutting,  in which 200  persons armed with  axes, scythes and cudgelsparticipated, occurred in Ankola Taluka  (Kanara District).  Sporadic picketing isbeing  continued in  Bombay City and 11  picketers were arrested  during the  week.Ordinance  10.  Section 3:   arrests, 14;   total under  detention, 85.   Section  4:orders, 45 ;  total in force, 875.  Section 17 : convictions, 12.Bengal.   The situation remains quiet except for a slight increase of activity in Midnaporeand Jessore.   Demonstrations connected with Gandhi&apos;s fast  are not anti-Government.Section 3 :  arrests, nil.  Section 4 : orders issued, 51;  in  force, 197 ; convictions, 88.Madras.   There is very little  civil  disobedience activity.   Attention is  concentrated  onGandhi&apos;s fast.  Numerous meetings have been held all over the Presidency to expresssympathy,  but  these are  almost entirely organised  by  caste Hindus.  depressed classes are apathetic, but the general  feeling  is in favour of separate electorates.Dr. Ambedkar&apos;s  lead will probably be followed.  No  disturbances  have occurred sofar.Central Provinces.   Mr.  Gandhi&apos;s fast has stirred deeply public opinion all  over the Province.  Civildisobedience activities are negligible.  Prosecutions, 14 ; convictions, 4.     1254   60  9.32
United Provinces.   Mr. Gandhi&apos;s declaration Las caused considerable excitement among caste Hindus,though  the indications seem to be that it is  mainly the political class  which  isinterested, and  the  whole incident is  viewed from  a political and not a religious-standpoint.   Great efforts have been made in the larger cities in particular to placatethe Depressed Classes by throwing open temples, but district reports suggest that thepublic meetings are much smaller than  might have been expected,  and it is obviousthat the interest taken by the Depressed Classes is  not  great.   Local leaders  whosupport Dr. Ambedkar are Avaiting for orders from him.  The arrangements made forthe representation of the Depressed Classes are mainly of interest to  their leaders, andthere is no organised opinion on the subject among these classes in general.  congress leaders are naturally taking the opportunity to attack Government as being responsiblefor the crisis.   The week otherwise has  been quiet.   Section 3 not used.   Elevenorders under section  4  issued  with  two  convictions  for breach of  such  order.Convictions for week: under Ordinance, 21; under  ordinary law, 88.

Section 3 : arrests, nil; total detained,  7.  Section 4 : orders, 4 ;  total orders  inforce, 38.   In regard to  the Dir-Bajaur situation, the Chitral relief column has reached Ziaratwithout any incident of importance and  marched to-day to Nagar.  Desultory snipingcontinues  at Bandagai Camp.   There  are indications to-day of Shamozai Lashkarsdispersing.   The situation generally, at  present,  is  satisfactory.  The remainder  ofthe Province is normal.Assam.   Miss  Wilkinson, under Congress auspices, visited Bhanubil Sylhet district wherethere is some agrarian agitation.  She  made  no speech.   Revolutionary leaflets havebeen posted in  and  around Sylhet, apparently by  College  students.   There  is  noexcitement about Gandhi&apos;s fast.Bihar and Orissa.    Political  interest is  concentrated  on  meetings  attended by caste Hindus andDepressed Classes regarding joint electorates.  The question is regarded as the concern of Hindus and the movement is  not at  present  anti-Government.  Five orders undersection 4, Special  Powers Ordinance, are still in force.  Number of convictions up to17th September, 10,024 ;  figure from one district not received.Ajmer Merwara.    No arrests have been  made  during  the week, and there have been no  activities in connection with  the civil disobedience movement.  Partial  hartals were  observed in Ajmer and Beawar in connection with Gandhi&apos;s  fast, and  meetings and  lectures-have been held,  at which the removal of untouchability was advocated.
