IS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT.                           CABINET                    Copy No..?.1(32) .The Needs Test.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.     1.   As the Minister of Labour points out in his memorandum, there Is a close relation between his proposalsfor transitional payments and the administration of publicassistance.   The two act and react on each other, and Ishould like to set down some considerations that thememorandum suggests.     2.   I agree that there is so much discontent with thepresent administration of the needs test, and that so muchof the discontent is justified, that action is neoessary.     3.   As to the causes of the discontent, at least ofthe legitimate discontent, I do not think that it is based onany real sense of injustice in the general principles of theneeds test as at present applied.   Discontent centres roundpractices in relation to assets, family income, anddisability pensions and similar special private means.   As toassets, a common point of view is that, aftsr all, the purposeof savings is to tide the saver over bad times, and that aman should use his  own money before he asks for somebody else&apos;s.As to family income, I doubt whether it is commonly thought tobe unjust that a person in need should be helped by nearrelations rather than by the taxpayer.&quot;  As to disabilitypension, both in the House of Commons and elsewhere I have found most critics  are satisfied with the present rractice whenit is explained to  them, that a part of the pension can be andis In fact neglected in calculating means, and that that partshould be related to the special needs resulting; from thedisability.
     4.   I saould day that public opinion is prepared tosupport the strict application ox the needs test ay longas it is administered witn equality.   The root cause ofthe admitted discontent is, I chink, discrepancies in theadministration of the test &quot;between place and place.   Ihad hoped that these could be eliminated by administrative measures, especially the services of the Inspectors of theMinistry of Health.   Much has been done in this directionbut time has not served for a complete remedy.   ihe local forces have proved too strong to be overcome, within thetime available, by the indirect pressure and the directpersuasion that are all that we can bring to bear upon them from the centre.     5.   Ihe inference that I suggest from this is thaton the one hand it is indeed necessary, as the Minister ofLabour suggests, to take steps to secure reasonableuniformity of administration (with due regard to differences in local conditions, such as rent and other variableconstituents of the cost of living).   But, on the otherhand, it should not be necessary to go ac far as his suggestions would take us in afiecting the foundation of theneedo test by rules laid down from the centre.          That foundation, as I suppose, is the principlethat what an applicant needs to bring him above the levelof destitution is a question to be decided by the facts ofhis case, and not by reference to arbitrary rules.
     6.   On the details of the proposals I would makethe following observations.     (a) Disability pensions.               If there is to be a percentage, it     should be checked by some absolute amount - e.g.,     &quot;50/;o or 7s.6d. , whichever is the less, shall be     disregarded-&apos; .   Ihis would bring it into relation     with the health benefit allowance.     (b) Workmen1 s Oompensation .               Ihe same limit should be set, for the     same reasons.     ( c) Assets.               I am not convinced of the justification     for an absolute distinction between house and     other property.   The suggested limit for     other property would produce a reasonable     result in the case of house property also, in     so far as the applicant lives in a house of his     own.          Proposals (a) and (b) if modified as suggested would not seriously affect public assistance practice.Proposal  (c) might be  expected gradually to increaseapplicants for public  assistance.
     7.   I wholly agree with the Minister of labour that it is better not to try and deal by centralmeasures with the matter of family income.  This is essentially a matter for the discretion of -ohe authority which is in touch with the case and acquainted with its-circumstances.  Io seek to frame regulations would lead on by degrees to the elaboration of a complex code.The automatic application of the provisions of such a codewould increase rather than diminish trouble and complaint.     8.   I agree, too, that it is better not to deal withscales.  l?or the efficient administration of a just and practical needs test, scales are, I think, useful only ifestablished locally as general guides in co-ordinatingcases;  and they are mischievous if imposed from thecentre as hard and fast rules, to be used in substitution for consideration of the facts of each case.     9.    here is one further matter, which I ought toemphasise.  The proposed Bill would relay, the strict publicassistance principles, in certain matters, in the case only ofpersons in receipt of transitional payments.  It should bemade clear at the outset that, if this be done, the practice in the areas in regard to ordinary public assistance will undoubtedly be brought into conformity.  It will be uselessfor me even to pretend, much less to secure, for example,that where a man is in receipt of a disability pension,half of it is to be neglected if he is a workman in receiptof transitional payment, but not if he is an agriculturallaboux-er in receipt of public assistance.    10.   Lastly, and more generally, whilst fully realisingthe difficulties of the position, I feel some doubt as to
the necessity of a temporary measure, pending a final measure for dealing with the administration of transitional payments,and, perhaps, all able bodied relief as well.          It will, I think, be agreed that there arecertain disadvantages in a temporary measure.     (a)  It means fighting a difficult battle twice over.     (b)  Only one of the purposes to be secured, i.e.          uniformity in practice in respect of assets, needs          legislation.  The other purposes can be secured by a          circular giving administrative directions.     (c)  To some extent the temporary measure cannot but          condition, if not prejudice, the final settlement.          For instance, whatever rules for administering the          needs test are made, on parliamentary authority,  as          a result of the temporary measure, must almost          necessarily continue to bind whatever authority may          finally be established for the purpose; and It may          well be desired that that authority should be free          from such rules.     (d)  The following is a more direct consideration.  In view          of the parliamentary time-table, action is hardly          possible, if it were desirable, before the          publication of the report of the Royal Commission.          Once that report is published, a partial measure  of          this sort will not, I fear, satisfy the critics or          stave off the attack.  It covers but a small part of          the ground that will have to be covered.  Discussion          will at once begin about the general solution.  We          shall be asked for our decision and our plan, and the          temporary and palliative measure will be belittled          and lost sight of.          A general measure will no doubt take time topass; but our policy could be announced with only so
much time as was needed for our own deliberations.   Wouldnot an announcement of the principles  of  our  general measure(and that it would be passed without delay) be  a betteranswer to criticism than a partial and temporary expedient?                         (Intld.)  S.H.Y.18th October,  1932.
