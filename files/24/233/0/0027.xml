Recommendation by the First Commissioner of Works in         accordance with Cabinet reference CC45(32) of 2?&quot;8-32e           The inter-departmental Rewards Cessssittee rejected the  proposal of the Air Ministry that a general service medal should  be issued in connection t?ith the operations on the North West  Frontier of India in 1930-31 by a majority of 02ses Departments  voting in the majority being the Admiralty, War Office and  Colonial Office o  Departments voting in the minority were the  India Office and the Air Ministry*           The Secretary of state for Air appealed to the Cabinet  to override this recommendation, and, on the 2&quot;?th Augusts I iras  requested to examine the question further and report to the CaMseto           I have relied entirely upon documentary evidence suh-  nitted to me by the India Office, the War Office and the Air  Ministry.           It is clear from these documents that the period during  which there is a strong case for the grant of a medal is the  period covered by Field Marshal Sir William Birdwoodes published  despatch9 namely, 23rd April to 12th September 1930o   There  can be no doubt that the extent of the operations found to be  necessary during these four and a half months was exceptional  and abnormal, especially in view of the fact that
the campaigning took place in the hot weather season in India.         The contention that the campaign was exceptionallyarduous is supported by the fact that, on the recommendation ofthe Governraent of India supported by the Secretary of State.the operations of 1930 have been allowed to count as war serviceand are to be duly recorded as such in the personal records ofall ranks who took part.         Further, the General Staff, India., in their summary ofevents in the Horth West Tribal territory for 1930 (SlOOO^IoOoS)state, &quot;the year may be said to nave been the most critical inthe history of the North West Frontlet since 1897( with thepossible exception of 1919.B         I am satisfied from the documents that had it not been for the activities of the Royal Air Force, and the loyalty anddevotion of the irregular forces (Militia and tribal levies),the Military in India would have had to undertake a much laoreserious and prolonged campaign than proved to be necessaryoIt is a matter of common knowledge that the condition of thenorth West Frontier was specially disturbed throughout the summer oJf 1930b  Ihat the activities of the Air arm wereexceptional., especially for the time of year, there can be nodispute.  The following table shows the number of hours^operational flying0 undertaken in successive years betweenMay and September inciusives^     1924       460 hours     1928      2700   n    (Waairistan operations)     1920     1927     1928       X4Q   u     1029     1930      8500   a
         The Air Ministry report that &quot;During the spring  andsummer of 1930 operations tools place contiguously for a periodof 143 clays from Bajaur to Waziristan as well as those in thePeshawar vale itself;  in these 121 officers and 900  airmenwore engaged.  Twenty-six tribes or sections of tribeswere involved; and daring the later stages of the operationsa total of 84 aircraft - seven-eighths of the strength of theRoyal Air Force in India - were engaged in simultaneousoffensive operations in the widely separated areas of U tin anKhel, Hohmand and Tirah territory ....  These operationstook place in the hottest part of the year: hundreds of tonsof &quot;bombs were handled in a sun temperature of 150o.   Longhours of exceedingly hard work were necessary to keep theaircraft serviceable;  and very great strain was imposed onall ranks.  Furthermore, no reinforcements were supplied  forunits in India during this period.&apos;         After a careful study of Sir W, Birdwood*s  despatchI QEJ satisfied that the work of fee Air Force was sorecontinuous and more arduous than that of the Army, thoughclearly many units of the latter had to undergo severedangers and hardships.         If the above recital is taken as the statement  of thecase for granting a medal - and I thiuk it is a strong one -regard must be had to precedents.         A general service medal was granted for the operations on the Berth West Frontier in 1919 and again in 192S for  theoperations in Wasiristan.  Although the amount of woperational&quot;flying undertaken in 1925 was only about one third of thatflown in 1930, and the campaign was less arduous from thepoint of view of the Air Force personnel, a medal was granted on that occasion.
( 4 )         la 1920 fclic Cabinet was appealed to,  to decide thequestion of a grant of a medal for the operations against theAlchwan tribes in Iraq.  On that occasion a committee of three members of the then Cabinet (Lord Salisbury,  Sir John Glim ourand Colonel Walter Guinness (Lord Hoyne)) unanimously recommended the grant of the medal in accordance with the submission of theAir Ministry.         I would refer to Gne further precedente  Between the10th August 1981 and the 25th February 1922 military forces were engaged in a campaign in Malabar, British India., againstthe Moplahs.  Lord Hawlinson&quot;s despatch on these operations wasreceived in October 1922, but was never published for politicalreasonso  In April 1923, the question of granting a medal was raised by Major Yerburgh, map and,  although the Government ofIndia had for some time opposed the&apos; grant of a medal, theyultimately agreed to its desirability and H0M0 The Kingapproved the grant of the Indian General Service medal withclasp wMalabar 1921=22) in January 19240   She total number of casulties on our side in connection with the Moplah risingswas 43 killed and 126 wounded, of which 5 and &amp; respectivelywere British officers.   In the Horth West Frontier operations in 1990 the number of our-S^^^&quot; casualties is given as 183s ofwhich 47 were fatal&quot;Having regard to the time of year at which the Moplah operations were conducted, I do not think it can be said that the Malabarfighting was as arduous as the work, particularly of the AirForce, on the Frontier in 1930*         All these precedents would point to the reasonablenessof granting the medal in the case now under consideration..         But I feel it necessary to point out some of thedifficulties that will be involved if the Secretary  of State forAir*s submission is approvedo
         In the first place the Secretary of State fop Airhimself suggests that the issue of the medal should he limitedto *the machines crews who actually carried out these hazardousoperations.0  In making their case before the inter-departmentalcommittee, the Air Council, while agreeing to this limitationadded that &quot;they desire to emphasise that this distinctionbetween the merits of air and ground personnel of the BoyalAir Force is invidious and artificial, and contrary to thesentiment of the Service.w         I generally take the view that if the medal is to begranted this particular limitation ought not to be maintained,and that the success of the Air arm on the Indian frontierdepends quite as much on the care and preparation of the machines at their bases as on skill and daring in the Air.Having regard to the future, and the use of the Air Force in operations of this kind I am sure it would be a mistake to seta precedent, particularly in this case, of granting a medal tothose who fly and refusing a medal to Royal Air Force groundpersonnelo         If this is agreed, \?e at once get into the furthercomplication that to grant a medal to the Koyal Air Force andnot to the Military forces, regular and irregular, would,although something of a special case could possibly be made out for such a course, lead to resentment and ill-feeling on thepart of the Arays. for unquestionably the operations on theWorth West Frontier in 1930 were combined operations in whichArmy and Air Force co-operated throughout.          The Government of India *s contention is, and in this they are  supported by the War Office, that once the medal is granted to any ground troops it is impracticable to withholdthe raedal from any troops west of the geographical line of the
Indus river, as all units west of the Indus to a greater  or less degree became involved in the operations on or near  theFrontier in 1030.         Prior to the Battle of Waterloo medals *?ere only grantedto a small percentage of personnel engaged, hut from the  grantof a medal to all Engaged in that battle has grown the practiceof a distribution to members of all units serving  within  a prescribed area during the period of a campaign.    I cannotbelieve that a geographical limit such as the line of the Indusriver, is the only method of limiting the issue of a medal in circumstances such as those that arose in 1930.         The Army Council give as their reasons for  opposing  thegrant of any raedal in the presect case, this difficulty ofdifferentiation, and endorse the view of the present Commander-in-Chief in India (Sir Philip Chetwode) that nin fact, if amedal were to be granted it would seem that all troops west ofthe Indus would have to be declared eligibleo  A distributionon such a scale (estimated at 35,000) would render the medalpractically valueless.0         They add that they also have a Bpoliticaln  objection -presumably that originally submitted by the Government of India,to the following effect.   &quot;The possible effects on the external relations of the Government of India have also to  be considered.It was at first thought that the Afghan Government might  be led,by the grant of a medal, to ascribe more importance to theoperations than it would suit our policy to admit, and that theymight Increase their interest in the Afridl question.H A settle-ment, however, with the Afridis has since been reached,  and,  ona reference to the British Minister at Kabul he has reportedthat  nthe decision of this question, whatever it may be,  is not                          ( 6 )
in my opinion likely to affect appreciably the relations ofHis Majesty6s Government with Afghanistan.&quot;         I should add that the Secretary of State for Indiapersonally is now in favour of the issue of the proposed medal,and that this &quot;political&quot; objection to the issue of the medal nolonger holds.         In the documents submitted to me the Secretary of Statefor India expresses himself in favour of &quot;a generous policy inthe distribution of medals.&quot;  His views are that the conditionsof war are changing so greatly that the old criteria of duration,casualties etc. can be applied with much less force than foxmerly,and if these are not adjusted to modern circumstances, our troops will be left with little if any hope of being able to earnsomething that will show that they have been employed on morethan ordinary peacetime duties.      In this general view I personally concur *         To sum up, I recommend that the Cabinet should approvein principle the issue of a general service medal for operations on the North West Erisatier of India between the 28rd April and12th September 1930, and should request the departments concernedincluding fee Government of India, to go further into thequestion as to what personnel of all forces should be entitledto receive the medal.         This,recommendation applies onlyto the operations on theHorth West Frontier between 23rd April and 12th September 1939.As regards occupation of theKhajuri and Aka Khel plains by military forces during the winter of 1930-31, I concur in theopinion of Sir Philip Chetxvode and the Government of india that a medal should not be granted..5rd october^^lggl                          Wo0oGo
