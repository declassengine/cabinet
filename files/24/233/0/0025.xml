THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT                 Printed for the Cabinet.  September 1932.SECRET.                                                Copy No.    9CP. 326  (32).                       [Amended Version of Annex.]                               CABINET.DISARMAMENT.     1.  THE Prime Minister asked me on Wednesday afternoon to circulate a paper on the European situation in relation to disarmament for the Cabinet fixed for to-morrow (Friday morning) at 11-30.  The time is short and the  interval has provided plenty of other occupations.   The following short sketch will convey to my colleagues the impressions which I have formed from a great  mass of recent communications and from close consultation with Sir Robert Vansittart, Colonel Sir Maurice Hankey and others.     2.  The German note to France of August 29th and what has  followed it, including the German attitude to the  French and British notes, has accentuated the alarm felt in Paris.   Our Embassy there had described very vividly the state of excitement and depression into which M. Herriot fell,  and his  speech last Sunday was noticeably  harder in tone.  In private conversation he and other French Ministers declare their  conviction that  Germany  is actually re-arming and  is meditating courses which will inevitably disturb  the peace  of  Europe. Germany&apos;s withdrawal  from  the Disarmament Conference on July 23rd and the manifest difficulty of getting her back into the atmosphere of discussion and negotiation are  threatening signs.  The first question therefore which suggests itself is are these French fears mere foolish phantoms, or have they a  basis of reality?  This vital  question might very usefully be the subject of concentrated and  co-ordinated study by the Committee of  Imperial Defence and the  Foreign Office.  For  the moment,  I  present  to  the  Cabinet, without  comment,  the following facts :      3.  Germany has already got some way in relieving herself of the Versailles Treaty.  The Rhineland has been evacuated six years before the expiration of the fifteen mentioned in the  Treaty.  Germany has become  a member of  the League of  Nations and a permanent member of its Council.  Reparations have received, it may be hoped, their final quietus at  Lausanne.   The Polish  frontier (a map of which we  are told is often hung in a young German&apos;s room to remind him  of the wound in Germany&apos;s side) is obviously the next element to be  tackled. The  long examination given to this problem during the Paris discussions showed that  there  is no hope of solution by  agreement between Germany  and  Poland or by any  simple logical test.  Therefore, if that situation is to be altered, it must be altered by force.  What are  the indications that Germany is thinking along these lines ?  They have adopted a plan for putting their youth through aperiod of  physical training, under military direction.   Though this is  done  in the name  of  athletics, it in fact provides not\ only the raw material for armytraining, but  very possibly  secures in advance registration and encadrement.Herr von Neurath, in conversations with me at Geneva and elsewhere, makes no secret of the German claim to re-organise their  land army,  which is limited  by the Treaty of Versailles to 100,000 men recruited for twelve years&apos; service.  Hetells  me                                        \      (i) That they desire to reduce the period of service to  six years, giving  as           his reason that they now have as many as two hundred suicides a year           in the army.   That may be so, but the new method provides fur double           the number of professionally trained men in the course of the next           twelve years.      6556  [7666]
     (ii) The organisation of a militia, by calling up 40,00u men for three months&apos;           training each year.   The reason given is that by this means they hope           to get control of the private armies, steel helmets, &amp;c, now parading t  t        Germany. v d(iii) The motorisation of cavalry.  ;&quot;&quot; All this manifestly indicates  that Germany would increase the strength ofher land forces very considerably.   Not only  so, but the view is entertained insome professional quarters that the transformation would give Germany a veryhighly-trained  striking force,  while at the same time enabling the militia, withthe police, to maintain internal order as well as to be drawn on for casualties.     Herr von  Neurath also insists that if, after the Disarmament  Conference,other Powers are permitted to have weapons of  a sort which Germany is deniedunder the Treaty of Versailles, Germany must have &quot; specimens &quot; ; otherwise herclaim for equality of status is unsatisfied.  It is manifestly difficult to secure thatthe number of li specimens &quot; should be  effectively checked, but the French appearto be more concerned about  the  re-organisation of Germany&apos;s  army system.Germany  has also recently made  it known that she is  going in for  a  third&quot; pocket&quot; battleship.     4.  Putting all  this  together, it is not surprising that there is a  body ofopinion in France which considers that Germany is preparing for the day when she may throw off the mask.  At any rate, there are moods in which France thinksso, and  for the practical purpose of disarmament the suspicion is nearly as badas the reality.   And we have information in the Foreign  Office that Hungary,whose army was until recently utterly deficient  in modern equipment, is taking steps to introduce up-to-date machine guns in large quantities (and this at a timewhen the Hungarian Government  is unable even to deposit pengoes in a blockedaccount for service on her public debt).   Anxieties on similar lines are entertainedover Bulgaria.    I think, therefore, that we must proceed upon the basis that French  fearshave at any rate got  sufficient  facts to support them to make the French  attitudeunderstandable.  It  is nothing to the  point to say that more effective measures for general disarmament in the past would have produced a better situation; wehave to deal with the situation now.    5.  The  Cabinet must now  decide not only  the general lines which british policy must  take in the face of  a most anxious  situation, but  the  concreteproposals which we are prepared to put forward.  Here again, it is no use merelysaying that Britain  has disarmed  far more than other people  (as she  has), or that the proposals announced by  Mr. Baldwin in the House  of Commons onJuly  7th after  the Hoover declaration  were  extensive and practical  (as theyare).  I must  report  to  my  colleagues faithfully  the present  atmosphere atGeneva.  As always, we are getting more kicks than credit.   There is an urgent necessity to  decide specifically our course, for  the Bureau meets on October 10thand it will be quite impossible to remain vague on, at any rate, three matters :         1. Air Policy. The Cabinet approved  the line taken by our delegation    which led  to the resolution  of July 23rd and directed  &quot;that the  three    Defence Departments should  examine and  advise as to the Resolutions of    the Disarmament  Conference,  in  a constructive spirit, as to how  far and    in what manner they can best be implemented&quot; (Cabinet Conclusions of    August 4th, 1932).  The Air  Ministry have since furnished a paper which    in effect declares that they cannot propose any means for implementing the     Air Resolution because they consider that there is no effective way  of doing     so.   I must therefore ask the  Cabinet to decide whether, when this  question    comes up in some ten days&apos; time  (as it assuredly will), the answer is to be     that in our opinion there is  no practical way of fulfilling the Resolution,    or whether we are going to put forward any and what constructive  plan.     I would ask the Cabinet at  the same time to  decide  who is to make the    statement.        2. Disarmament.  Control-This  also   comes   up   immediately  in    challenging form.  The former Home Secretary, in his parting declaration     (page 21 of Cabinet Conclusions 47 (32)),  told us, as the fact is, that he had    written  a  paper  urging, under strict conditions, that the  Disarmament
Commission should not  be  denied all  power of  inspection.   Our service departments are against the whole idea, largely I think because they fear that the power might be abused for the purposes of getting information orspying  out the nakedness of the land.   There is  undoubted force  in these arguments, but the Cabinet must appreciate the strict limitations which willcircumscribe the power.  Inspection could only take place (a) if the allegationof infraction was made on the direct responsibility of a State;  (6) if it wasformulated with precise  particulars, so  as to prevent a  roving  Commission;(c)  after which, the Disarmament Commission, consisting of  permanentlyappointed individuals, would consider it and, if necessary, request  observa-tions from the Power  accused; (d) after which,  it is suggested, they mightreport to the Council of the League, who would no doubt consider the matter further; (e) with the  ultimate result that the nomination of  an inspectormight be authorised.   The argument  that  these  limitations  deprive  theproposal of much of its danger is reinforced by remembering that the wholething depends on acceptance by all the States at Geneva, including America.On the  other  hand, the  Cabinet will appreciate that direct opposition to anything of the kind  from  us  is likely to be disproportionately  exploited.Moreover  the French attach  considerable importance to the power as a meansof keeping Germany in check.   They think that even though inspection doesno good, the situation would be worse if you begin by  agreeing that in noconceivable circumstances can there ever be any inspection at all.     3. Looming up behind these more detailed points are the twin problemsof &quot; equality &quot; and &quot; security.&quot;  Mr. Henderson called on me to-day and madethe suggestion that a resolution in  the form printed  in the annex might possibly meet the case and bring the Germans back to discussion. I have hadno time to study it, but think it best to include it in this paper.                                                                J. S.Foreign Office, September 29, 1932.                                 ANNEX.             [Given me to-day by A. H.   J. S., September 29.]    The Bureau of the World Conference for the Reduction and Limitation ofArmaments, recalling the Resolution whereby the General Commission decidedthat a substantial reduction of world armaments shall be effected, to be applied by a  General Convention alike to land, naval, and  air armaments, and that a primary objective  shall be to  reduce  the means of  attack,  recommend to theGeneral Commission that the Disarmament  Convention by which these purposes are fulfilled shall be founded upon the following principles:      1. Since this Disarmament Convention will embody the decisions of a world conference in which all nations have freely taken part on a footing of completeequality, it is right that its terms should govern the armaments of all nationsalike, and  that in the rules which it lays down  and in  the system of nationaldefence and international control which it establishes there should be no specialor exceptional discrimination against any  signatory power or group  of powers.    2. The  Bureau  further   recommends  that  this   principle  should  be practically applied  without increasing the present level  of the  armaments nowpossessed by any nation but by that substantial reduction of existing armamentsupon which the General Commission has  already agreed.    3. The Bureau  recognises  that, if such juridical equality of status among all nations in respect of their armaments is to be given practical effect, States  mustbe able to rely for their security not upon their own  national armaments alone,as limited by the  world convention, but  also  upon the collective organiseddetermination of the nations of the world that the crime of aggression shall be prevented.
