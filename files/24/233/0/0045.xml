THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  October 1932.SECRET.                                                Copy No.   9C.P. 347  (32).CABINET.                     THE  DISARMAMENT CRISIS.     IT is  becoming increasingly evident that we are approaching, if indeed we have not already  reached, a crisis in disarmament policy.  The crisis  that is threatened is both international and domestic.   The Cabinet will have to reach very promptly a  positive  decision on the subject, or  the  consequences  will be incalculably grave both to international peace and to the fortunes of the National Government.  I have called the  attention of my colleagues  from time to  time to the situation as it  has been developing during recent months, and I must now put on record in  the plainest terms my own convictions on the subject.     2.  We  have  to  make up our minds whether we are prepared  to  see  the Disarmament Conference break lip  in  confusion  amid loud though  unmerited reproaches addressed to Britain,  or whether we are prepared to authorise  and act upon a bold declaration which (a)  might prevent this collapse, and (&amp;) would, in any  event,  discharge this country from the reproach of having failed to give  the lead which might  save the  Conference.  Let us first consider what the failure of the Disarmament Conference would mean.  Germany has unquestionably  secured a wide measure of sympathy in her claim for a recognition of the principle of equality of rights.   She has withdrawn from Geneva and does not  mean to return until that  claim is granted.   It may well be, and I incline to think, that her present rulers  are aiming at rearmament, or at any  rate at a  reorganisation which would strengthen  her effective military force, with a view to bringing to- an issue the question of the Polish boundary.  But the point is that as things are, and  as they will remain unless we advocate  a bold course,  Germany has a very considerable mass of public opinion on her side.  If, on the other hand, German3r&apos;s claim  is  promptly and publicly met, public opinion outside  Germany&apos; will be exerted against Germany&apos;s  rearmament and tile  forces inside Germany which are pacific will exercise more weight.  There are no other means by which  Germany can  be prevented  from unilateral rearmament.   Moreover, if  Germany  is  not brought back to the Disarmament Conference and agreement reached  at Geneva, there is not the slightest prospect of any serious reduction  of armaments on the part of Germany&apos;s neighbours. A  Conference which began  by aiming at general disarmament will  end in increased armaments and the  probability of  a renewal of war. Our own country may keep out of it, but, even so, we cannot expect  our own  burdens  in the matter of armaments to  be  reduced, and they will probably have to be increased.  And a new war in Europe will shatter economic recovery. Equally important in my eyes is the result upon the standing and authority of the National Government. Yet the influence of our National Government,  backed by American sympathy and  approval, is vital to the maintenance of  peace  in Europe.  We shall be told that we have  failed in the very department  in which the united voice of  Britain should have been used with telling effect.  The running- fire of criticism in  Parliament and of reproach in the press will become more and more intense.  The goodwill of the United States is only too likely to be prejudiced and in the end the opinion that we must acknowledge Germany&apos;s claim to equality in  a really effective  form will prevail and  will be put into operation, if not by this Government, by some successor, who will pay a higher price after British prestigehas suffered a terrible blow.      6572   [7729]
     3.  These consequences are by  no means  deserved, for not only has thiscountry made the only big contribution to disarmament since the war by its ownexample, but it has, in fact, been active in support of disarmament at Geneva.  Itwas a.British Resolution which was unanimously adopted in favour of qualitativedisarmament and  the  abandonment  of essentially offensive weapons.    It wasBritish influence which framed the Resolution of  the 23rd  July.   It was verylargely British initiative which brought about the naval treaties, and every reallyimpartial observer knows  that Britain is  earnestly trying to  promote  better relations in  Europe and to encourage the keeping of the peace.   But all this doesnot in the least affect the plain fact that unless we adopt a drastic policy now. thecondemnation is going to fall on us.  Both at Geneva and in England the opinionprevails that the Americans made a great contribution with the Hoover plan; thatthe Italians  have put forward proposals which if adopted would strike at the rootof the trouble; and even the French are now  meditating a new proposal, which islikely to make a great impression and will make it  appear that they too have bigschemes for  &quot; security &quot; or &quot; the organisation of peace &quot; to  which Britain takesobjection.:    4.  The question, therefore, is this : If  we are not prepared to be held in alarge degree responsible for a smash at Geneva, what is the proposal which wemust make to avoid that result and at  any rate to  re-establish our moral leader-ship, even though w e cannot thereby necessarily secure world-wide disarmamentl.I am satisfied in my own mind that the  only means is to take and announce a verybold decision we should of course  consult  the French and Italians and endeavourto bring them into line before making an announcement (though there is very little time to lose) and the announcement of what  we should be prepared to do will beconditioned  on all other nations being prepared to  do  the  same. -  It may be,therefore&quot;T&quot;th&quot;at&quot;we  shall&quot; hot be called upon to implement our declaration, but we ought not to  make it unless we mean it, and, on the other hand, we ought to realise the consequences which will follow if we do not make it.   The declaration shouldtake the general form that His Majesty&apos;s  Government are ready, if all otherGovernments \vill_dp_theJjk^ to adopt and apply the principle of equality^bfrights-in the following three respects :     (a) The limitations on  Germany&quot;s armaments should  be contained in the          same Disarmament Convention as the limitations of the armaments of          others.   This was expressed in  the British Note of the loth  September           &quot; The United  Kingdom  Government conceive the object  of the          Conference to be  to frame a Disarmament Convention  upon  the          principle that each State  adopts  for itself, in agreement with others,          a limitation which  is self-imposed  and freely entered into as part          of  the  mutual obligations of  the signatories to one  another,-&apos;  &amp;c.          Thus the articles in Part V of the Treaty of Versailles which at present          limit Germany&apos;s arms would be superseded and Germany&apos;s limitations          would be arrived at by the same process and expressed in the same          document as those of others.  Both Italy and France are prepared to          endorse this view.    (b) The newly-expressed limitations in the case of Germany must last for the          same period and be subject to the  same methods of revision as those of          others.   In other words, Germany cannot  be bound for ever while her          neighbours are bound for five or ten years.   It will be sufficient, in any          declarations made at this time, to say that questions of duration and          revision must be dealt with under the new Convention in the same way          for all  States.  On this, Italy  agrees; France is hesitating, but I  do          not think she could hold out against this.    (c) Wo  must declare for the principle that, as  part of the new Disarmament          Convention, there shall be no kinds of  arms which are forbidden to          Germany,  while  they are permitted to other States.  Inasmuch as          any  extension of  the  list  of German arms  is bound  to lead  to          rearmament and  a  new competition, I take the view that the proper          form of the Declaration would be that we am prepared to  accept the          principle, if other  States will  do the like, that  we content ourselves          with  those kinds of arms, to  which Germany is now limited.The exact form and application of such  a declaration are, of course, matters of thegreatest  gravity.  For example, I can conceive a formula  which  would allow
-Germany, without increasing the sum total of her naval tonnage, to distribute itas she likes between different classes of ships.  This method of treatment wouldbe far more practical if there Avas added the condition of not exceeding presentbudgetary  figures.   And,  of course,  extremely  important  questions  arise  inconnection with land armaments and air forces.    5.  I wish to state to the Cabinet quite simply that, as the result of the close attention which has been given to this subject for many months, I am convincedthat no  less drastic step can produce the results desired.  AVhatever might havesatisfied Dr. Briining some months  ago, nothing less will  be sufficient now.  Anabstract declaration, in carefully guarded terms, in favour of the principle  of equality, will no longer suffice.  If we adopt that course we shall at once be askedboth by  Germany and by our own press and  public whether this means that we propose for the future to forbid Germany arms of  a sort which we and Francemay have.  It is  therefore useless  to dwell upon paragraphs (a) and (b) aboveunless we also embrace paragraph (c;,  and I  can only repeat my conviction thatthis bold course, with all its  undoubted anxieties and difficulties, will be foundto be  the only way  to preserve British prestige and promote the continuance  ofEuropean peace.    6.  I should not despair  of getting France to accept this formula if we andItaly  strongly pressed it, provided  that we made it plain that  we  would standwith them in  resisting the proposed reorganisation of the  German land forces  insuch a way as to increase their striking power.  This proposal to reorganise theGerman Army is the most alarming  feature of the German plan. And, assuming that there was an Anglo-French-Italian declaration  to the effect proposed, publicopinion  would recognise that  this wras an adequate meeting of the German claim and would discountenance all forms of German rearmament.                                                                     J. S.    Foreign Office, October 17, 1932.
