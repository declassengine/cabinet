It was proposed by this third party that;, pendingthe settlement of the dispute, the amounts claimed by your government as being due to Great Britain under severalheadings including Land Annuities shou?ud &quot;be deposited in theBank for International Settlements, and that such deposithaving been made the discriminatory tariffs imposed by bothsides should be withdrawn and negotiations immediatelyinitiated between the two Governments.         I gave my approval to these proposals and I now wish to confirm formally the acceptance of them by theGovernment of the Irish Free State                            Yours sincerely,                               (Signed) EAMON DS VALERA0The Right hon  J4H.

AUKEX III.                               Dominions Office,                                    Dooming Street,                                        14th September,  1952,.Dear Mr. de Valera,          I am in receipt of your undated letter which you sent me a day or two ago.   I was aware from whatLord Sankey had told me that the person to whom yourefer had visited Dublin in a private capacity and had discussed with you the possibility of finding a basis for the termination of the dispute concerning thefinancial relations between the two countries,    Iunderstand that the visit was made with Lord Sankey&apos;sknowledge, but that the person in question - and Iwould desire to make this plain - was not in any wayauthorised by the Government here to make the visit to dublin, or to put forward any proposals.          As  I   have repeatedly stated, I profoundlyregret the present deadlock, and should be ready toconsider any proposals yrhich you may desire to putforward for the purpose of ending it, so long as theyare on the general &quot;basis which I made clear in my talks with Mr. 0&apos;.Kelly and Mr, Lemass in Ottawa, namely, thatthe Treaty, and the continuance of the Irish Free state as a Member of the British Commonwealth, are accepted as the basis of all discussion.          May I once more recapitulate the history ofthe present deadlock.   When in March I received information from a public statement by you in Dublinthat you proposed that the Land Annuities should be withheld, I pointed out in an official despatch that
the payment of these Annuities resulted from a formal agreement between the two Governments0   You then repliedasking what was this undertaking to pay and I repliedat once giving the tervis and dates of the agreements.I received no further communication from you as to the annuities until in June we met, first in Dublin and afterwards in London,   At those meetings the UnitedKingdom Government put forward the suggestion that,since both Governments felt that they were right andhad an unanswerable case, it ought to be possible torefer the legal issues arising in connection with theLand Annuities to a Commonwealth tribunal of the kindagreed upon at the last Imperial Conference.  I latermade it clear as regards the other disputed payments,that if His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom could be given an indication of the grounds upon whichthe agreements were challenged and were consideredsuitable for arbitration, they would consider thepossibility of agreeing to arbitration on the same basis and by the same tribunal as was proposed in thecase of the Annuities,,   The proposal as to arbitration by a Commonwealth &quot;tribunal did not commend itself toyou, and at the conversation in London in July the PrimeMinister suggested, as an alternative to arbitration,negotiation between the Governments, provided that themethod of negotiation offered a reasonable likelihood of a speedy settlemento    The position still remains,as has been made clear on more than one recent  occasion,that we are prepared either to refer the question ofthe Land Annuities to arbitration within the British
Commonwealth of Nations or to negotiate,  on the &quot;basis  either of the present situation lor of the restoration of the  status quo as it existed before the Annuities were withheld,  alwaysprovided of course that there is a prospect of finality.          But the proposals to which you refer in your letter,as I am sure you will agree, afford no satisfactory basis fora settlement, as they offer no certain prospect of finality and give no.guarantee of a speedy termination of the dispute.Moreover, v/e understand that one of the conditions which youmake is that, in the event of negotiations failing tc  result inagreement, the deposit with the Bank for  international settlements should be returned to the Irish Free StateGovernment.  The United Kingdom Government cannot regard this as acceptable since it means that a failure to agree is tc beheld to be decision in favour of the Irish Free State  Government0Such a proposal is not only impossible from the point  of view ofthe United Kingdom Government, but brings no nearer the settle-ment which we believe that the peoples of both countries desire.          If, however, you are able to make any suggestionsfalling within the framework mentioned in the statements madeon behalf of the United Kingdom Government and on the  general basis referred to in my talks at Ottawa, you may be assured that they will meet with ready consideration on our part.  &quot;Wedeplore the present situation and desire to see the restorationof friendly relations between the two countries at the earliest/possible moment.  We have given proof of that desire in thevarious suggestions which we have offered for the solution ofthe deadlock, all of which you have rejected without suggestingothers which might lead without loss of time to a definitesettlement, and if the deadlock lasts the responsibility forits continuance cannot be laid at our door.                           Yours sincerelyP                                 (Sgdc)  J.H. THOMAS.
