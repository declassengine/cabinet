Li&apos;THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOYERNIPrinted for the Cabinet.  October 1932.SECRET.Copy No.   9     1*2 fCP.  333 (32).CABINET.IMPERIAL  PREFERENCE  FOR  PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    AT a meeting held on the 27th April, 1932 (reference Cabinet 25 (32)), theCabinet discussed the difficulties connected with the proposal to grant preference to Palestine, and agreed as follows :     &quot; (a)  To approve the proposal of the Cabinet Committee appointed at themeeting of  the  17th  February, 1932 (Cabinet 14  (32)), that theforeign countries principally concerned should be informed that HisMajesty&apos;s Government  in the United  Kingdom propose  to givePreference to imports produced from Palestine; to explain that they desired to proceed with propriety  and would like  to know  if thecountries concerned  felt any  objection.  If  objection were  taken,subject to a fresh decision  by the  Cabinet, the proposal might bemade to take the question by agreement to The Hague Tribunal fora decision  as to whether the Preference proposed  would  be an infringement of &apos; most-favoured-nation &apos; treatment.  An alternative course that  would be open to the Cabinet particularly if a nationwere  to refuse to go to The Hague on an  agreed case and repliedthat  His Majesty&apos;s  Government  were acting at their  risk inimposing the Preference would be to raise the  question at the mandates Commission, and on their report to suggest to the Councilof the League that a decision should be obtained from The Hague court.    &quot; (b)  That the United States of America should be added to the countries to             be consulted, viz., Spain, Italy, -Brazil and France.    2.   The five foreign countries mentioned above were accordingly approached,and copies of despatches addressed to His Majesty&apos;s Representatives are attached(annexures I and II).    3.   Replies have now been received from all the Governments concerned, and &apos;copies of these replies are also attached  (annexures III to VII).    4.   It will be seen that, with the exception of  the French Government, all have expressed their opposition to the  proposal of  His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Governments of the United States, Italy and Spain claim that Palestine is aforeign country, vis-a-vis the United Kingdom, and that their own goods imported into this country must be accorded any preferential rates which may be concededto goods from Palestine.    The Government of the United States goes further, and adopts the sameattitude with regard to the Preferences which have already been  granted (withthe concurrence of  the Law Officers of  the  Crown)  to the &quot; B&quot;  mandated territories, Tanganyika Territory, the Cameroons and Togoland.    The Government of Brazil has no objection to offer to  the assimilation  ofPalestine to the other Territories of the Empire, provided that preference is not extended to oranges  to the detriment of BraziFs export trade in that fruit.[7692]n&apos;iiiMiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiliiiiiimiiiFiiiiiiiiitiriiimiiiiiiiiiiiiviniiiiiiiiNiiniii.....in iimm*mnnnnnmr&apos;&quot;*&quot;&apos;***&quot;&apos;*-&apos;&quot;-**&apos;&quot;--
    5.  In the circumstances further reference to the Cabinet is now required, inaccordance with their decision of the 27th April, 1932, as to the adoption of oneof the two alternative courses then contemplated, viz.,  (i) to take the case byagreement to The Hague for a decision, or  (ii) to raise the question at the next session of  the Permanent Mandates Commission, with a  view  to obtaining a reference to The Hague at the instance of  the Council of  the League (it beingremembered that  the question is one of some  urgency,  as the desire for the granting of Imperial Preference to Palestine goods is shared both by Jews and arabs in Palestine).    6.  In view, however, of the ground..upon which some countries  base  their objection which, if sound, would seem to call in question the grant of preference to &quot; B &quot; Mandated Territories, and, indeed, to Protectorates and of the reference in terms by the United States Government in their note of the 27th August to thegrant of Preference to &quot; B &quot; Mandated Territories, any further action by HisMajesty&apos;s Government might raise wider issues, and I feel therefore that it wouldbe  useful  to have re-constituted  the Cabinet Committee which previouslyexamined this matter in order that the present position may be fully and carefully considered.                                                                  P. C.-L.    Colonial Office, October 7, 1932.
                             ANNEXURE II.[E  3147/606/31]                  --(No. 647.   Immediate.)Sir,                                           Foreign Office, July 2, 1932.    I HAVE to inform Your Excellency that the question  of the  possibilityof extending Imperial preference to Palestine under Clause 4 of the ImportDuties Act, 1932 (a copy of which is enclosed herein), has recently been  underconsideration by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, and that asa first step it has been decided to ascertain the views in regard thereto of certainforeign  Governments likely to be  interested, of which the Italian Governmentis one.    2.  His Majesty&apos;s Government clo not consider  that the Italian Governmentwould be  entitled, under the most-favoured-nation  provisions of the  Treaty ofCommerce and  Navigation  between  the United Kingdom  and  Italy of the15th June. 1883 (viz. Article 2), to claim that Imperial preference should alsobe extended to goods the  produce or manufacture or Italy.      [7692]                                                      B  2                              ANNEXURE  I.[E  3147/606/31]                  ---(No. 1415.   Immediate.)My Lord,                                      Foreign Office, July 2, 1932.    I HAVE to inform Your  Lordship that  the question of the  possibility of extending Imperial preference to Palestine under clause  5 (2) of  the ImportDuties Act, 1932 (a copy of which is enclosed herein),  has recently been  underconsideration by His  Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, and that,as a first step,  it has been decided to ascertain the views in regard thereto ofcertain foreign  Governments likely to be interested, of which the French Govern-ment  are  one.   The  French  Government  have  been  included  among theGovernments to be approached not because  there is any reason to anticipate thatthe trade of France is  likely to  be particularly affected,  but  because it  seems probable that the French Government, owing to their position in Syria, may havean  interest in  this  question  somewhat  similar  to that  of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.    2.   I shall accordingly be  glad if you will inform  the French Governmentthat His Majesty&apos;s Government  in  the  United  Kingdom  propose  to give a preference to the import of produce from Palestine, but that they do not considerthat by reason  of such  an extension  of Imperial preference to Palestine theywould be obliged to extend similar benefits to foreign countries in virtue of their obligations under the  most-favoured-nation clauses of their existing commercial treaties.  In order, however,  that they may proceed with due propriety and inharmony with the spirit of friendly co-operation which so happily exists between his Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government in regard to  questions concerning the territories of the Middle East for which France and  Great Britainhave mandatory responsibilities, they would be glad to learn whether the FrenchGovernment see any objection to such a course.  You should add that, as regardsthe degree of preference to be accorded  to Palestine, it is proposed to grant thepreference  which is accorded to goods consigned from and grown, produced or manufactured  in  certain other   mandated  territories  administered  by  HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.   It will also be desirable to informthe French Government that it is, of  course,  not proposed that the Governmentof Palestine should grant a  preference to produce  imported from  the UnitedKingdom.    3.   I request that you will endeavour  to obtain a very early reply from theFrench Government and will acquaint me with it at the earliest moment.    4.   I am addressing to  His  Majesty&apos;s  Representatives  at  Washington,Madrid,  Rome and Rio de Janeiro a similar request in the terms of the despatchesof which copies are enclosed herein.                                                 I am,  &amp;c.                                      (For the Secretary of State),                                          (Signed)    &apos;  G.  W. RENDEL.    His  Excellency the Right Hon. Lord Tyrrell,           G.C.M.G.,  K.C.B., &amp;c, Paris.
     3.   I  shall accordingly be glad if you will inform the Italian  Government that His  Majesty&apos;s  Government in the  United Kingdom propose to  give a preference to produce from Palestine  imported  to the United Kingdom.  You should, at the same time, inform them of the views of His Majesty&apos;s  Government in the United Kingdom on the question referred  to in the preceding paragraph, and explain that, in order that His Majesty&apos;s Government may proceed with due propriety in the matter, they will be glad to learn whether the Italian  Government feel any objections to such a course.   You should  add that, as regards the degree of preference to be accorded to Palestine, it is proposed to  grant the preference which is accorded to goods consigned from,  and grown, produced or manufactured in certain other mandated territories administered by His Majesty&apos;s  Government in the United Kingdom.  It will also be desirable to inform the Government to which you are accredited that it is, of course, not proposed that the  Government of Palestine should grant a preference to produce imported  from  the United Kingdom.     4.   I request  that you will endeavour  to obtain a very early reply from the Government to which you are accredited,  and will acquaint me with it at the earliest moment.     5.   I am directing a similar request  to His Majesty&apos;s Representatives  at Washington, Madrid and Rio de Janeiro,  and  am  addressing His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Paris in the terms of the despatch of which a copy is  enclosedherein.      1                               I am, &amp;c.

Sir Ronald Graham,           G.C.B., G.C.M.G..  &amp;c, Rome.ANNEXURE III.            Mr. Osborne to Sir John Simon. (Received August 30.)(No. 353.)(Telegraphic.)                                 Washington,August 29, 1932.    YOUR despatch No. 890.    United States Government is unable to concur  in  view of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  regarding United  States  treaty  rights, considers  Palestine  is aforeign country within the meaning of Article 2 of Convention of 1815, and boidsthat any tariff privileges accorded to Palestine should also accrue to the UnitedStates.    United States Government  adopts  same  position  regarding  preferencesaccorded to mandated territories specified in your telegram No. 386.    Despatch follows.                                        Department of State,Sir,                                           Washington, August 27, 1932.     I  have the honour to refer  to Sir Ronald Lindsay&apos;s note, No. 232 of  the15th July, 1932 (supplemented by. your note  No. 245 (C. 84) of the 6th August,1932),  outlining a proposal of the British Government to grant a preference toPalestinian products imported into the United Kingdom, and inquiring whetherthe Government of the United States feels any objection to this proposal.    In reply, I regret to state that this Government is unable to concur in  thefeeling of the British Government respecting the right of the United States underthe most-favoured-nation provisions of the Convention of Commerce between  thetwo  countries  signed  on the 3rd  July, 1815, to claim  such preference.  TheGovernment of the United States considers that Palestine is a &quot; foreign country &apos;&apos;Avithin the meaning of the term  as  used  in article 2 of  the convention, andtherefore holds that any tariff privileges accorded to Palestine should also accrue to the United States.    In regard  to preferential treatment of  goods originating in or consignedfrom  those other British  mandated  territories named  in your note  of   the
6th August, 1932, I wish to inform you that the Government of the United states has been unable to perceive any ground upon which Tanganyika, the Cameroonsunder British mandate,  and Togoland under British mandate, should, in mattersof trade preference, be treated as if they  were possessions of the mandatoryPower.  I feel, therefore, called upon to state that the position of the Governmentof the United States with respect to these territories  is the same as its position with regard to Palestine.                                                   ,                               Accept,  &amp;c:                                     (For the Secretary of State),                            (Signed)      JAMES GRAFTON ROGERS.    Mr. F. D. G. Osborne, C.M.G.,        Minister Plenipotentiary,            British Charge1 d&apos;Affaires ad interim.ANNEXURE IV.                               Note verbale.(Amended translation.)    THE Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, which immediately brought to theattention of the departments concerned, the contents of the note verbale No. 229of the 11th July last, have the honour to inform His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Embassythat, after careful study of  the proposal contained in the said note, it does notappear possible that the Italian Government should give up the right to claim in favour of Italian goods,  in virtue of the Anglo-Italian commercial treaty ofthe 15th June, 1893, which assures most-favoured-nation treatment to Italy, anypreferential treatment which His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government may applyto goods from Palestine.    This  results  from  the fact  that  Palestinian territory,  judging  by thestandard of the other territories under mandate, is  to be considered as a  foreign country vis-a-vis the mandatory nation, and therefore not as forming part of theBritish Empire.    As regards  paragraph  2 of Article 5 of the Import Duty Act of 1932, towhich reference is made in  the subsequent note verbale No. 238 of the 15th Julylast, it appears  to the Italian Government that this cannot be invoked in thematter under examination, inasmuch as it is a  domestic  law  designed ultimately to place the territories under British mandate on a footing similar, from the preferential tariff standpoint, to  those  over  which  His Britannic Majesty&apos;sGovernment exercise a protectorate.  This law, as an independent measure, cannotannul the provisions of obligations in international contracts.ANNEXURE V.                          From Minister of State.(Translation.)Your Excellency,                               Madrid, September 8, 1932.     IN reply to the Notes which Your Excellency addressed to this Ministry onthe 9th and 15th July last and the 10th ultimo, in which you solicited the views ofthe Spanish Government on  the proposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government in  theUnited Kingdom to extend Imperial Preference to goods imported into the UnitedKingdom from Palestine, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that  theGovernment of the Republic are of the opinion that, in accordance with the termsof Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, and of the stipulationslaid down in Article 18 of the Mandate over Palestine ceded to  Great Britain,the territory in question can  in no way be considered as Imperial territory, butonly as a foreign country dependent  on the League of  Nations, which from aneconomic point of view, is in  a similar position as regards the  Mandatory power as it is in regard to other countries and Sovereign States.  Proof  of this is to befound in the fact that Palestine is prohibited from according differential treat-ment to British products, it  being stipulated that  these shall be subject  to  thesame treatment as those proceeding from any other State belonging to the Leagueof Nations.     .
    In view, therefore, of the foregoing, the Government of the Republic, basingtheir  attitude on the most-favoured-nation treatment  which Article 6 of  the relevant  Anglo-Spanish  Commercial Treaty  accords without any reserves  to spanish goods imported into the United Kingdom, are unwilling to renounce thebenefits of any  privileges which  Palestine might eventually  accord to  GreatBritain, and accordingly maintain that any such privileges of whatever naturethey may be shall be automatically applied to similar products of Spanish origin:ANNEXURE  VI.                                      Ministry for Foreign Affairs,Mr. Charge d&apos;Affaires,                      Rio de Janeiro, Aiujmt 18, 1932.    I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your note No. 134 of the24th July, in which you communicated the desire of your Government to extend to palestine the treatment of Imperial Preference, set forth in clause 5 (2) of thecustoms  tariff of 1932, and  consult the Brazilian Government regarding thismatter, in view  of  the commercial agreement between the two countries, signed on the  11th September, 1930.    In reply I  have to inform you that the question of determining whetherPalestine should be considered a foreign country, as  foreseen in the text of theagreement, or to what point her relations of dependency, by virtue of the mandateexercised there by Great Britain, incorporate her in the British Empire,  appearsto escape the notice of the other countries.    The Brazilian  Government, meanwhile,  would have  ho  objection  to raiseagainst this assimilation of Palestine to the other territories of the Empire, forthe effect of the preferential tariff, if it could have the assurance that the projectedconcessions would not be extended to  oranges, so that the similar product  ofBrazil  exported  to Great Britain would not be unfavourably affected.    I take this opportunity to reiterate, &amp;c.                                 (Signed)       A.  DE  MELLO  Franco    To M. E. A.
