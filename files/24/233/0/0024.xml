THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOYERNMEN1Printed for the Cabinet.  September 1932.SECBET.                                                Copy No.   9CP.  325  (32).CABINET.THE SINGAPORE  BASE.                NOTE BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR.    WHILE the subject of the Singapore Base is before the Cabinet, I desire tobring to notice  the need for  further  aerodrome accommodation at  Singapore.This matter is not at present  specifically  covered by the recommendations madeby the Committee of  Imperial Defence in respect of the defences at their last meeting, but is implicit in them.    2.  These recommendations state that air forces are essential for co-operation in the defence of the base, and specify  that aircraft  should take part in all branches of the defence, including air defence (in which fighting aircraft would co-operate), and  offensive operations against carriers, capital ships, and all other forms of attack by sea, land or air.    Moreover,   quite  apart   from  the  defence  of  0the  base,   aerodromeaccommodation will be required for the Fleet Air Arm Flights  when disembarkedat Singapore.    3.  In the event of a risk of war developing, the single aerodrome which atpresent exists is entirely inadequate for the aircraft that would be essential for defence and  for the  fleet.   I should explain  that the need  for  this secondaerodrome is  not conditional upon the provision of additional air squadrons notyet approved.  It is required to enable existing units to co-operate in the  defenceof the base on arrival by air in emergency.    A site has been acquired by the local  Government, and a recent estimate forits preparation involves a total of about  50,000, including the  cost of fuel andmagazine  storage. No other buildings are contemplated.    4.  I  therefore  ask that  Cabinet  authority  should  be   given  for  theconstruction of this aerodrome to be proceeded with.  If the preparation of the site is deferred until  there is another emergency in the Far East, it may well bethen  too late.   The gun defences recommended  by  the  Committee of ImperialDefence cannot,  I understand, be installed in less than three or four years.   It istherefore   all the more  important that  measures  essential to  the  effectiveemployment of the only alternative method of defence in the interim should not bePO  P                                                                   L.    Air Ministry, September  28, 1932.[7662]
