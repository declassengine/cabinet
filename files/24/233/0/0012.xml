DOCtUENT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S G01/l!iRrMBHT)SECRET.                                    Copy  No&apos; ^C.P.31302).                   G A: B I N E T.      Ottawa Conference. Agreement between the  Indian       and the United Kingdom Delegations.  MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.         I circulate for the information of mv colleagues  anote which has been drawn up in my Department on the agreement reached at Ottawa between the Indian and United KingdomDelegations.23rd September 19           The preferences granted to the United Kingdom by this  Agreement cover trade to the value of  17,4-70,000 out of a total  trade of  b2,125*000, i.e. they offer a prospect of a substantial3S.  development of lines of trade which are at present of the value  of about  17,470,000.           What is granted to India includes           (1) The retention of the existing ^references on tradee.to the value of  29,500,000 out of about  49,000,000.           (2) New or increased preferences on trade to the value  of about  1,750,000.           It also guarantees free entry for the bulk of other  imports from India. This does not guarantee the continuance of  the duties at present levied on foreign imports of most classes  of those imports;   but on the other hand it ensures that if the  latter duties are  raised for any reason,  the preference given                                                            will
                                                             2.will be increased.         In regard to cotton piece goods the Agreement is silent (though it holds out the prospect of the grant of a preference on non-protected cotton goods - a matter of comparatively small importance). This was necessary - and was accepted as such by the British Delegation - in view of the fact that a Tariff Board Enquiry into the cotton industry was proceeding.         It happens however that almost simultaneously with the conclusion of the Ottawa Conference, in consequence of an emergency Tariff Board report (arising out of a special reference made to them as to whether current prices of foreign cotton piece goods were likely to render ineffective the protection granted by existing legislation) the Government of India have announced the imposition of an increased duty, in most cases 50 per cent, on foreign piece goods.  This benefits a branch of British trade which amounted in 1929-30 to  25,000,000 (though it fell in 1930-31 to  9,500,000). British trade in these goods already enjoyed the benefit of a &quot;differential&quot; duty, but the margin of difference  in favour of British goods is now much wider.         The agreement is also silent about the treatment of Indian iron and steel in the United Kingdom.  Negotiations were., however, conducted between the United Kingdom and  Indian Delegations at Ottawa with a view to the continuance of free entry of Indian pig iron and the establishment of  the free entry of sheet bar (an important variety of semi-finished steel) in return for preferences for United Kingdom galvanised sheets. Since the Conference the negotiations have been continued with the help&apos; of a representative of the Tata Iron and  Steel Company and have reached a satisfactory conclusion. ,Uso,  a substantial proportion of British steel imports benefit from the pre-Ottawa                                                    &quot;differential&quot;                                                                /
&quot;differential&quot;  duties.         Thus if and when the Ottawa-India-United KingdomAgreement becomes effective, there will be preferences inrespect of more than half of the trade between India and theUnited Kingdom  in each direction in addition to other benefitshaving been conferred on India fs exports to the UnitedKingdom.         Provision is also made in Articles 9 and 12 forpreferential trading between India and the Colonies;  andalthough the volume of trade affected is quite small in comparison with the other trade affected by the Agreement,the Indian Delegation believe that important benefits to indian trade will in future result from the provision madefor the extension to India of preferences accorded by theColonies to other parts of the Empire.         Both parties also undertake to extend to one anotherany preferences they give to any Dominion.         Unlike the Agreements between the United Kingdom andthe Dominions which are for five years certain, the agreement is subject to denunciation at six months1 notice by either side.This difference is due mainly to the impending constitutional changes in India.
