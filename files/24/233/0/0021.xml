1r o30(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC             MAJESTY1 3 GOVERNMENT ) .                                                   COPY MOSECRETCP.332 (32)                       GAB I N E T.                            INDIA     Appreciation of the Political Situation by theGovernment of India, dated 24th September, 1952.     Circulated for the information of the Cabinetby the Secretary of State for India.
  Confidential appreciation of the Political Situation      in India, dated 24th September, 1952, issued        on the authority of the Secretary of                  State for India.     The last appreciation referred to the communal decisionof His Majesty&apos;s Government and indicated briefly natureof the problem.  It is now possible to estimate some ofits reactions.  On the whole, the reception given to thedecision has been on the lines which were anticipated.  Itis satisfactory to observe  that the promulgation of theaward has not given rise to any recrudescence of communalagitation; even in Bombay, where feelings between the two major communities were strained owing to the riots ofMay and July last, the decision has not been used as an excuse for stirring up communal strife , and no untowardincidents have occurred.  In the Punjab also, where Sikhagitation prior to the announcement of the decision wastending to provoke Muhammadans, the situation, thoughstill not free from risk, has not deteriorated duringthe last month.  The mass of the people, especially in rural areas, have in fact, shown few signs of taking any interest in the award, and no attempt has been made, as yet, by agitators to stir them out of their apathy bymisrepresenting the decision.  At this season of theyear the cultivator is too occupied with his cultivationto pay ready heed to peripatetic agitators?.   Of the communities concerned, the Muslims generally are satisfied with the decision.  Some expressions ofdisappointment are heard, but further  demands are onlybeing put forward as  an offset to the demands of other
communities.     The Sikhs, as was anticipated, condemn it whole-heartedly, and some extreme suggestions have &quot;been putforward, such as that no reforms should be introduced in tiie Punjab on this basis, or that districts of theprovince in which Muslims predominate should be split off and  amalgamated with Sind or the North West frontier province.  The Sikh Council of Action hoped to        .persuade, the Sikh members of Legislative bodies to resignas a protest, but their refusal to do so has been a set-back to the extremists.  Though on some occasionsinflammatory speeches have been made, not much progress is being made in enlisting volunteers into the AkaliShahidi Dal or in the collection of funds.  The situationis thus on the whole easier and the danger of an outbreakof communal strife recedes with every day that passes.    The Hindu press has hardly a good word to say forthe decision.  It is condemned in an extremist paper asperpetuating communal dissensions, as the death-blow ofIndian nationalism, and as an unholy pact between Muslimcommunities and British commercial interests in India.Even more moderate papers echo these opinions in a morerestrained manner.   But though the press and manypublic speakers have taken this attitude, the trend of a debate on the question in the Legislative Assembly and of similar debates in Bengal and Central Provinces legislative councils goes to show that dissatisfaction with the awardis not so deep or so genuine as it is made out to be, andthat the more sober-minded political elements in  thecountry are gradually asserting themselves.   The  attitudeof Sapru and Sastri, who are prepared to  accept  it, has
lias probably influenced many persons of moderate viewsmore than violent diatribes in the press.     The decision in so far as it affected the depressed classes attracted at first comparatively little attention;Depressed Classes representatives themselves were inclined to criticise it on the ground that the representationgiven in special electorates was inadequate.  attention has now been focussed on the problem of Depressed Classesby the extraordinary action of Mr. Gandhi in announcing-his intention to fast unto death unless the communalaward is modified.     Mr. Gandhi has started his fast on the day fixed(September 20th).  It is hardly possible to forecast itsoutcome, but some   factors bearing on it may be indicated.  His action is calculated to rouse Hindu feeling against the Government, though at present attention isbeing directed almost entirely to efforts to reach asettlement with the Depressed Classes that will save hislife.  If such a settlement proves to be impossible,efforts will no doubt be made to stimulate feeling againstthe Government.  The Civil Disobedience movement is, however,now at a low ebb, and in many parts the name of Gandhi has lost the potent influence which it once had.  But theremay well be a recrudescence of trouble, especially in those areas of the Bombay Presidency where Mr. Gandhi&apos;personal influence is strong.  Attacks will also, in later stages, doubtless be made upon the Government fortheir refusal to give Mr. Gandhi an unconditional release,though here again, at present, the policy of theGovernment has evoked little serious criticism.Government offered to remove him from the jail in which he
                                                       ISO is  confined so  as  to  give him  facilities for  attempting to  effect   agreement,  between the Depressed  Classes and caste Hindus.   He  has  preferred  to  remain  in jail, but the Government  have arranged for  him to have  the same facilities  for  discussion of the  Depressed  Classes problem as  he would have  enjoyed had he been outside  jail.  They consider it impossible  however, during the  continuance of  the Civil Disobedience Movement to allow him to move freely about  the country, for his presence in Bombay or  Gujerat  or other centre,  in which his personal influence is  still strong, would  undoubtedly lead  to  ,:-.&apos;a recrudescence of  the movement even  though  he confined his attention to  the problems which he has raised.     It is very  satisfactory  that  it  is generally recognised, and this  point was made  clear in  a debate in  the Assembly,  that the question of the depressed classes is  one  for the Hindus themselves to  settle and that His Majesty&apos;s  Government  is  not responsible for the situation which has arisen.    There  is also very definite support, in particular  among Muslims, for the view  that it  is impossible for  His Majesty1s Government to yield to  Mr. Gandhi*s demand.     Whether the Hindus  will  be able  to settle the problem themselves  is very  uncertain and  the situation is at present dynamic.    The  representatives of the Depressed Classes are themselves  divided into  two  parties.  One&apos; party, led  by Rajah is  in favour  of  reserved  seats  in general Hindu constituencies ,  but have) put  forward  the claim that the number of  seats allotted to them should be in proportion  to their population, a claim  which may reduce caste Hindus to an  insignificant  minority  in  some councils.
 This  solution was rejected &quot;by Mr. Gandhi himself at the Round Table Conference and it was largely his rejection that  led the other party under Dr. Ambedkar to press for separate electorates.   Great pressure will no doubt, be brought to bear on this party by caste Hindus to give up their claim and thereby save Mr. Gandhi&apos;s life,  Eut Ambedkar is not: likely to give up this safeguard unless he receives some substantial recession in return and, in fact, he has put forward some very sweeping demands as an alternative to separate electorates.   Meanwhile, Hindu leaders such as Malaviya are urging that  Hindus themselves should remove the disabilities under which the Depressed Classes labour, and resolutions advocating their admission to temples have been passed at Benares and elsewhere.  Such a course of action may, however arouse considerable opposition from orthodox and more  conservative Hindus , for when attempts have been made in the past to secure admission of untouchables to a temple serious opposition has been experienced and riots have  not infrequently occurred.  It is hardly possible to upset a system of centuries in a few short weeks.      It is unfortunate that this agitation has come at a time when there were good prospects of further progress with  constitutional discussions.  As explained in the last  appreciation, a large number of liberals disliked the procedure which had been indicated by the Secretary of State.  In his speech in the Assembly on 5th September His Excellency the Viceroy made tha announcement that HisMajesty&apos;s Government proposed to invite a small body of representatives of the States and British India to meet them  in London about the middle of November to discuss,
and, if possible, reach an agreement consistent with the declared policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government uponimportant questions that still remain to  be decided.  this announcement has been generally well received,  though someof the opinions expressed have been rather non-committal.There has, during the past month, been no new development in the Civil Disobedience Movement.  Attempts to  hold so-called political conferences and to carry out raids onnotified buildings continue to be made with a view tosustaining interest in the movement, but  there  are signs that these forms of demonstrations are attracting verylittle public attention.  All the provinces continue toreport a general improvement in the situation.    In theiTorth West Frontier Province even in Peshewar district,the red shirt movement is now at a low ebb.  In Bengal,civil disobedience movement is said to be almost a negligible factor in the political situation, but thereis no abatement in terrorist activities,  and yet anotherattempted assassination of a police officer is reported.Mr. Grassby, the additional Superintendent of Police atDacca, was shot at and wounded by a Bengali youth.Fortunately, his wounds are not serious and his assailant,-who was hit by revolver shots fired by his guards, was captured. It is satisfactory  that the Bengal LegislativeCouncil has passed the bill introduced by  Government toconfer upon the Executive powers now enjoyed by means  ofOrdinances for dealing with terrorist outrages.
