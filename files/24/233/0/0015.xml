OCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OP  HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).    THE.REGULATION OF. MEAT IMPORTS IN RELATION TO          THE&quot;TmimikTfcoma, OBLIGATIONS&quot;OF              THE UNITED KINGDOM.         Memorandun by the Secretary of State              for Foreign -Affairs&quot;. &apos;     In his memorandum CP. 295 (32) of September 1st,  1932,the President of the Eoard of Trade calls attention to  thetreaty difficulties which way arise if the Government take powers to regulate directly the import of meats into thiscountry in fulfilment of the &quot;agreed programme&quot; of Ottawa.To meet these difficulties the President suggests fourpossible courses of action.   He dismisses the first twoas impracticableg  he considers the third somewhat tooingenious3  and he recommends the adoption of the fourth.     I  have carefully considered the proposal recommendedby the President and I feel that my colleagues should have before them the reasons which induce me to think that itwould be dangerous to adopt it.     The proposal is based on Article 5 of the international convention for the Abolition of Import and Export Prohibitionsand Restrictions, signed at Geneva, November 8th, 1927.  the text of the Article is as followss-     &quot;5.  Nothing in this convention shall affect the right   of any high contracting party to adopt measures prohibiting   or restricting importation or exportation for the purpose   of protecting, in extraordinary and abnormal circumstances,   the vital interests of the country.     &quot;Should measures of this-character be adopted, they shall   be applied in such a manner as not to lead to any arbitrary   discrimination against any other high contracting party.RET,CABINET.-1-RBBBHUBHUH
114   Their duration shall be restricted to that of the   causes or circumstances from which they arise0&quot;     The circumstances in which the limitation of importsof meat into the United Kingdom were agreed upon at theConference at Otta?/a are known generally.  It would seemalmost impossible to contend that this limitation, knownto have been agreed upon with reluctance by the UnitedKingdom for the benefit cf Australia and New Zealand,  isa measure taken for the purpose cf protecting tho &quot;vital interests&quot; of the United Kingdom.   The contention wouldbe too palpably disingenuous.   If  it were put forward and if the question were then brought before the Hague court or an international arbitral tribunal I am advised that it would be very doubtful whether H.MoGovernmentwould succeed in establishing their contention.     Moreover it is clear that if it is to be contended that this particular limitation is one covered by theprovisions of Article 5, it would follow that there is virtually no measure taken under any circumstances which astate could not justify under this Article if it chose tosay that it considered it was a measure to protect its&quot;vital interests&quot;, and that this International Convention,in the promotion of which H.M.Government have taken soprominent a part, is really meaningless.     it will be noticed also that, as the Fresidenfsmemorandum states, there is no provision in the treaty withGermany corresponding to Article 5 of the international convention and the proposal is in theory admittedlyinconsistent with that Treaty and reliance is merely placedon the fact that in the case of Germany the question is
unlikely to arise in a practical form owing  to  the  absenceof inports of frozen meats from that country      I conclude therefore that it would he unwise to  adoptcourse (4).   As regards course (3)  the proposal is admittedly very complicated and I should like to have more time to consider it in all its implications  beforeexpressing a definite opinion on it.(initialled)   J.S.Foreign Office.
