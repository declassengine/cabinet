THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1932.SECRET.                                                Copy No.    9CP.  323  (32).CABINET.MEMORANDUM BY  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR                    FOREIGN AFFAIRS.     GERMANY  has  announced  that  she  will absent  herself  from  the Disarmament  Conference  until  she  is reasonably satisfied that her claim to- &quot; Equality of rights &quot; is going to be met.  The Disarmament Conference cannot succeed-and,  indeed,  cannot  make  effective  progress  of  any  sort until Germany resumes her place and takes part in its deliberations.  Attempts are being made  at Geneva by way of private conversations between France, Italy, the United States and ourselves to find a way out.  The matter is exceedingly urgent, not only because of the grave consequences which will follow to European relations, to the chances of peace and to our relations with  America if it is not dealt  with,  but because Baron  von  Neurath is  attending  the meeting of the Assembly of the League which is now going on. and this provides an opportunity which is not likely to recur of consulting personally with him at Geneva.  It is therefore of the greatest importance that the Cabinet should direct its mind to- this problem and should reach a definite decision as to what this country would&apos;be  prepared  to do.     2.  The phrase &quot; Equality of rights &quot; is an attempt to translate the German expression &quot; Gleichberechtigung,&quot; and needs some analysis,  for it seems to me to be  capable of several applications which have not been clearly distinguished.  In essence Grermany&apos;s claim is that,  as the result of the  Disarmament Conference, she should be in a position  of equality in status with other countries so far as the limitation of her armaments is concerned.  She does not claim that her armaments should be equal in amount, but she contends that the discrimination in point of status which is imposed upon her by Part V of the Treaty of Versailles must be- terminated.   There is no possible doubt that she  is going to  persist in this claim,. and that if  it is not granted she will take the law into her own hands.  That would mean a repudiation of the obligations of the Treaty  of Versailles,  which would be followed by grave reactions in France, and would create a most dangerous&apos; situation in  Europe, which would certainly destroy the Disarmament Conference and might put in jeopardy.peace itself.  It is essential, therefore, to analyse the German claim  to equality and to decide what we  can do about it.     3.  It seems to me that the German claim for equality of status may be said to have three aspects or to  involve three different applications.   For simplicity, I will call these (A) common document, (B) common  duration, (C) common list of arms.  I will  deal with these in turn,  and  would like a definite decision of the Cabinet on each of them. (A) Common Document.     4.  In this connection, the point is that Germany claims  that, whereas af present her armaments are restricted by Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, the result of the  Disarmament Conference should  be that they  are no longer so. restricted, but are restricted, like the armaments of  other  Powers, by the new Disarmament  Convention.  In  that Convention, as  a result  of  negotiations between different Powers, each signatory will insert the figures by which it agrees,       6554  [7657]
to be bound, and to these figures the other parties will agree as part of a generalscheme.  Consequently, when the new Convention comes into force, the limitations on Germany&apos;s armaments  will be those in that Convention,  and. Part V of theTreaty of Versailles will be so far superseded.     1 regard this claim of Germany as entirely reasonable and quite irresistible.This mode of treatment was adumbrated in the conversations earlier in the year with Dr. Bruhing and Mr. Stimson at Geneva and later in conversations betweenthe Prime Minister and the Germans at Lausanne.  This conception of equality of status is expressed in the British Note of 19th  September as follows :^ -            &quot; The  United Kingdom therefore conceive  the object of  the Conference  to be        to frame a Disarmament Convention upon the principle that  each State adopts for        itself, in  agreement with others, a limitation which is self-imposed  and freely entered        into, as  part of the  mutual obligations of the  signatories to one another.   There        will thus be, as the  result of the  Convention, no distinction  of status;  evewone&quot;s        armaments will be  controlled by  the  same  process;  and limitations which  have        already been prescribed by existing treaties such as the various Peace Treaties or        the Naval Treaties of Washington and London will, save  so far as they are modified        by mutual  consent,  reappear in  the  voluntary  and comprehensive compact  about        to  be negotiated at  Geneva.  It  will  then be this  last-named document  which        is the effective obligation binding upon all.  This  conception of the work and purpose        of the Disarmament Conference gives the answer, in the view of the United Kingdom        Government, to the question of  status  raised in  the communication of the  German        Government of the 29th August.&quot;     Herr von Neurath, in private conversation with me  during the last few  days,has recognised the importance  of this statement and has  admitted  to me that itdoes represent what was adumbrated in conversations with the Germans earlier in the year.  The statement is  entirely approved by Italy  and, I believe, by theUnited States.   And, what is more, France also accepts it.  So far, therefore, theinequality can be  removed.(B) Common Duration.     5.   German disarmament under the Treaty of Versailles  is,  according  to its terms,  to last for ever.  The  proposed Disarmament Convention  would be anagreement for so many years say, five or ten with the provision that before theend of the period there would be another Disarmament Conference with a view to making a new agreement.   The question therefore arises whether, as the resultof stating the limitation on Germany&apos;s armaments in  the new Convention, theobligation on Germany is going to be transformed from  a perpetual restriction toa restriction lasting only for the duration of the Convention.     Germany insists that  there should be no differentiation between  herself andother signatories in point of duration.  It seems to me impracticable to take anyother view.  Germany would never sign a Convention which imposed limitationsupon her for a  longer period  than upon others.   The only chance of gettingGermany&apos;s agreement to, and observance of, limitations approximating to those inthe Treaty of Versailles, is to make the new obligation  last for the same time asthe  obligation  of  others.   In  the  course  of  my  recent  interview  with herr von  Neurath, he asked me what would happen, as I conceived it, when theperiod of the  Convention  was  oA^er.   I told him  that  it  appeared to  me  to beimpossible to  treat  Part V of the  Treaty of  Versailles as  reviving when theDisarmament Convention came to an end. The future was a matter for discussion,but  my idea Avas that either  all Powers alike would be free, subject to the negotiation of new arrangements, or all Powers alike would continue to be boundin some form or other by existing arrangements  until new arrangements  weremade.  But in either event  there would be no distinction in point of status between germany and the rest, and therefore equality would be preserved.     The  French  are  inclined to take  a different view,  though the argument against them is  so strong that  I should hope  that a united stand on the point byAmerica,  Italy  and ourselves might bring them round.  They are, not Avithoutreason, terribly  afraid of the future and cling to the Treaty of Versailles as theirsure shield. It  is, however, nothing of the kind, for the real choice before Franceis between (i) making an  arrangement with Germany now which  is sufficientlyreasonable for Germany to keep, and (ii) refusing to ma,ke such an arrangement,with the result that Germany does what she likes in disregard  of the Treaty. Wemust, as  it seems to me, satisfy Germany&apos;s claim to equality on  this point of-duration, and I shall be glad to have Cabinet approval of this view.
Foreign Office, September 27, 1932.(C) Common List of A rms.    6.  This is a more difficult point.  At present, under the Treaty of VersaillesGermany is forbidden to have any ships of war over 10,000 tons, any tanks, anysubmarines, any large mobile land guns and any military or naval aeroplanes.Supposing that the result of the Disarmament Conference is a Convention whichdoes not prohibit all the rest of us from having any of these weapons, can theexisting prohibition be maintained against Germany ?   Germany maintains .thatif this were the result proposed, there would still be inequality in status which she cannot accept.  On the other hand, Herr von Neurath, in his conversation theother day,  repeated what has often been said of late  on Germany&apos;s behalf,viz., that she would be content with &quot; specimens &quot; of arms at present prohibited,such as tanks or guns, without claiming to have large numbers, as she  does not wish to rearm, but only to have her right recognised to equality of status.  Thereare undoubtedly grave difficulties in conceding this point to Germany.  To my mind, the idea of &quot;specimens&quot;  is rather fantastic in any case.  The Frenchregard it as an excuse for at any rate providing models which  could be rapidlymultiplied.  Moreover, it amounts, in however limited a degree, to re-armament,and that is contrary to the whole purpose of the Disarmament Conference and  tothe hopes and desires of a large section of opinion here and in the United States.I have asked Mr. Wilson,  who represents the United  States at Geneva, to getMr. Stimson&apos;s view, pointing out that a decision may have to be  taken whether we should make this concession to Germany as the necessary price of getting herback to the Conference or whether we should refuse to  make  it, whatever theconsequences are.     It may be assumed that, if the concession was made,  we should have Franceagainst us and Italy with us.  We  should  probably be denounced in Leaguecircles, especially as most of our critics would not face the unpleasant fact thatit may be a choice between doing this and failing to secure German co-operation,with the result that the whole enterprise of disarmament is doomed and Germanyrearms  without agreement or restriction.     The situation is  so  critical that I feel I must ask for a Cabinet  decision.If  the choice comes to be between (1)  Germany&apos;s continued abstention  from theDisarmament Conference and all that that involves to the future of disarmament and the peace of the world, and (2) agreeing that Germany may have a range of choice between weapons permitted to others, provided that this does not involve,during the period of the  Convention, a substantial increase in  her equipment as  a whole, which is the choice to be ?
