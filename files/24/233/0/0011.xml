OTTAWA CONFERENCE.          Note  by the Prime Minister.       I have received the accompanying letter andhave decided that I ougnt to communicate it to theCabinet under conditions of special  secrecy.(Initialled)  J.R.M.10, Downing Street, S.W.1.

Copy.                                 Home Office,                                         Whitehall,  S.W.I.                                           16th September,  1932,,  Dear Prime Minister,                    w-&quot;       My colleagues and. I have given the most careful  consideration to the arguments you put forward at  our meeting  on Wednesday afternoon,,   We agree entirely with you that  it would be desirable that the unity which has been maintained  during the past year should be continued at least  until the  immediate difficulties with which the country is confronted  are overcome.   And you will concur that during this period  we have given abundant proof that we have not allowed personal  views or considerations of party to interfere with our loyal  co-operation in your Government.    A great deal has already  been accomplished.   The Budget has been balanced, &quot;borrowing  for the Unemployment Fund has ceased,- the   sterling is safe,  the success of the Conversion Scheme has shown that British  credit has been fully re-established, the Lausanne Conference  has begun successfully the work of removing the impediments  which reparations and war debts have raised against the  recovery of world trade.       The task of reconstruction is, of course, far from  complete,,   There is India, about which we are in  full accord.  But, as you pointed out to us, the critical issues to-*day  centre about the World Economic Conference which is soon to  assemble.   It is not too much to say, in an age in which  political and economic issues are inextricably intermingled,  that our national future largely depends on whether or not  this Conference, together with the Disarmament Conference,  succeed in improving the prospects of international trade and  of a real reduction in armaments.       Into the co-operation upon which v/e have been engaged  for these national ends is now injected the Ottawa agreements.
Before the British delegation left for Ottawa,  the cabinet was well aware that we viewed the outcome with grave anxiety,and particularly the possibility that the channels ofinternational trade might be further restricted.Unfortunately, on studying the agreements which have beenmade we find our fears fulfilled.   We believe that a policywhich involves the putting of taxes or restrictions on theimportation into  Great Britain of vital food stuffs, inreturn for reductions on the duties on British manufacturesentering the other parts of the Empire, many of which areuncertain and indeed problematic, is fraught with the gravestdanger to Imperial unity.   If the Ottawa Conference had resulted in a general reduction in the tariff impediments tointer-Imperial trade, the question would have had to beconsidered afresh;  but that proved to be unattainable.     Further there is the proposal, embodied in theagreements, that the right of the House of Commons to amendfiscal duties as it may consider the necessities of  thecountry to require shall be restricted.   We regard  this asunconstitutional and altogether inadmissiDie.   Taken as awhole, the policy, in our view, is likely to tend to the disruption rather than to the unity of the Empire.     But our objection to the Ottav/a agreements goes even further.   If they are ratified they will destroy thefreedom of action of the United Kingdom representatives  atthe World Economic Conference.   Thirty per  cent, of our external trade is with the Empire, seventy per cent, is  withthe vest or the world.   For  the revival of  industry and the decrease of unemployment it is absolutely essential  that atthe forthcoming Conference we should he  free to make agree-ments for the lowering or removal  of all barriers  against british goods, whether in the form of  tariffs,  quotas  or
exchange restrictions.   It is not less essential, if theConference is to lead to an all-round reduction of tariffharriers, that Great Britain and the Dominions should he ableto co-operate in bringing about such reductions.   Yet the ottawa agreements will compel us to maintain duties and quotas for long periods, irrespective of any facts or proposals whichmay emerge at the &quot;World Conference;  we shall have boundourselves to restrict and regulate various staple trades in a manner which may malce beneficial international agreementsimpossible.    Already some foreign countries are contemplatingretaliation against us, or entering into special arrangements with our competitors to the detriment of our own traders.     It is now contemplated also that, in pursuance of theagreement with Canada, we should denounce the existing tradetreaty with Russia.   We view this step with great anxiety, asit is likely to lead to still further loss to our export tradeand increase in unemployment.     We are unanimous in our conclusion that it is impossiblefor the Liberal members of the Government to approve the ottawa agreements.    Nor do we think it possible to apply the &quot;agreement to differ&quot; to the present situation.   Such a constitutionalanomaly may be introduced once in the face of a grave andimminent national danger.   It is not possible to repeat it whenthe national emergency, in the sense in which it existed last summer or last January, has been overcome, without stultifyingourselves, and thereby ending whatever value our co-operation inthe Government may have possessed.   It is right that you should know that we have not failed to consult leaders of the liberal party who have served in previous Governments - in particular.Lord Grey, Lord Crewe, Lord Reading, Lord Buxton and Mr. H.A.L.Fisher.   Without exception they all concur in the course we aretaking.   We do not for a moment forget, however, the considera-tions you pressed upon us.   We remain most anxious to do
anything in our power, consistently with the views we feelourselves hound to express and to act upon, to maintain thepresent political combination under your leadership.   Wetherefore make, for your consideration and that of our colleagues, the only suggestion that seems to us possible asa means of relieving the situation - that the announcedpolicy of the Government should be changed, and that further progress with the Ottawa agreements should be suspendeduntil after the World Economic Conference has been held.     Such a delay, we believe, would be in the best interestsboth of this country and of the Empire.   On fuller consider-ation of the effects of the agreements, public opinion, bothin this country and in the Dominions, may well reach theconclusion that it would be better for the Governments toenter that Conference unbound by prior agreements, able toco-operate untrammelled in any world movement for freer trade which may prove to be practicable, and to postpone finaljudgment on the Ottawa agreements until the results of theWorld Conference are known.     If that course were adopted we would gladly continueto co-operate in the work of national and Imperial recon-struction under your leadership.   But if the Cabinetdecides to ask Parliament to implement the Ottawa agree-ments before the World Conference takes place we shall, with-the utmost reluctance, be forced to place our resignationsin your hands.                        Yours sincerely,                            (Sd. ) HERBERT SAMUEL. Right Hon.J. Ramsay MacDonald,  E.P.
