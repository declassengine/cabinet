 :S DOOUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT *ORET.,p. 337(32)                    CABINET.     COPY NO.                     ANGLO-SOVIET QffMMgRqTAL AGRBEidENT.               Memorandum by the.President of,the Board of Trade.           It has been realised for some time that the Temporary      Commercial Agreement made with Soviet Russia in 1930 was not      a satisfactory instrument from the point of view of this      country.   It gave the Russians equality of treatment in this      country with other foreign countries in all matters concerning      persons, goods and ships, but to this country it gave little      since the usual commercial rights are of practically no value      when the sole trading body is the government of the country.      Rights in respect of customs duties, for example, are of no      value in Russia.   The only question of importance is, whether      or not the Soviet Government will buy our gcod3.  So long as      we are obliged to give Soviet Russia most-favoured-nation      treatment, we cannot bring effective pressure to bear on them      to buy more of our goods.            For this reason, among others, the Cabint Committee      set up to consider trade with Russia reported in May last      (CP. 169/32) in favour of terminating the Agreement and      replacing it by a new instrument.   Action was deferred by  the      Cabinet at that time,  but the results of the Ottawa Conference      make it necessary to consider the question immediately.           Article 21 of the Agreement with Canada, made at Ottawa,      rua-sas follows: -             &quot;This Agreement is made on the express condition that,           if either Government is satisfied that any preferences           hereby granted in respect of any particular class, of
   commodities are likely to be frustrated in whole or in   part by reason of the creation or maintenance directly or    indirectly of prices for such class of commodities   through state action on the part of any foreign country,   that Government hereby declares that it will exercise   tho powers which it now has or will hereafter take to   prohibit the entry from such foreign country directly   or indirectly of such commodities into its country   for such time as nay be necessary to make effective   and to maintain the preference hereby granted by it&quot;     It is, of course, known to everyone that the intention ofthis Article is to secure that restrictions shall in certaincircumstances be imposed in this country upon the importationof goods of particular kinds from Russia.  Under tho Anglo-Soviet Temporary Commercial Agreement,  1930,  it is providedthat: -      &quot;The natural produce and manufactures of the Union of    Soviet Socialist Republics shall enjoy in the United    Kingdom all the facilities, rights and privileges which    are at present or may be hereafter accorded to the    natural produce and manufactures of any other foreign    country, in all that relates to the prohibition azid    restriction of imports and, exports, customs duties and    charges, transport, warehousing, drawbacks and excise&quot;.     It is, therefore, clear that, so long as tho commercial agreement of 1930 remains in force, it is not possible to placeany prohibition or restriction on the importation of Russianproduce which is not equally applied to produce from all other sources,  and it is presumed that, in pursuance with the Agree-ment with Canada, it will be necessary to denounce the Anglo-Soviet Agreement at an early date.  Indeed it was clearly under-stood between the United Kingdom and Canadian delegations at ottawa that this Agreement would be denounced as soon as may be*     Two questions arise in this connection:  first, whetherafter notice of denunciation has been given,  the SovietGovernment will be willing to continue to place orders in thiscountry for goods and to employ British shipoj and, second,if they refuse to continue trading with this country, what will be the effect on our export trade.  The first of those questions,  together with a number of related issues, is dealtwith in a memorandum prepared in the Foreign Office for the
Prime Minister&apos;s information, which, with the ForeignSecretary1s permission, I attach as Annex I of this note.The  second is dealt with in a note which I attach as annex II.  A note is also attached (Annex III]* dealingwith the possibility that Russia may attempt to importsubstantial quantities of goods into this country in anticipation of a prohibition.     The general conclusion on the first question is that,in the new circumstances, the Soviet Government will have totake into account the fact that the United Kingdom is theirlargest market, taking about one-third of their exports,  andthat they are dependent upon that market for exchange withwhich to meet obligations which are maturing daily here andabroad.  If therefore the Soviet Government set a high valueupon the fulfilment of their obligations - and this isnecessary if they are to be able to continue to enjoy the credit required for the fulfilment of the present Five-year plan and its probable successor - they will do their utmost to retain so much of that market as is possible;  and it is  tobe presumed that,  if they think that any retaliation against us would be followed by still further restrictions upon their exports to this &quot;market, they will continue to buy here andto use our ships.   The question of credits is,  however,  ofgreat importance in this connection,  since it is probable that,however much they might wish to do so,  the Russians, owingto their present outstanding commitments, could not pay cashfor their purchases here,  at least for some time to come.     It should not, however, be forgotten that, as a resultof the Agreement with Canads, we may have to restrictdrastically Russian imports into this market because russia is frustrating by deliberate dumping the policy of HisMaje8ty&apos;s Government, and in that case the Soviet Government
may find themselves unable to fulfil their obligations here  ,and abroad.  Should default become inevitable it may well bethat the consideration of their dependence upon this marketmight not weigh quite BO heavily as it may be expected to doif the restrictions are not so drastic; but the probabilityis that the Soviet Government will do ItB utmost to avoiddefault and our commercial policy need not be greatly influenced by the risk of such a contingency.     The immediate position therefore is clear.  In view ofthe commitment in the Ottawa agreement, we must denounce theCommercial Agreement of 1930, and it need not be anticipatedthat such aotion would necessarily have serious consequences for our trade,  As to the next step, it is suggested in theattached note by the Foreign Office (Annex I) that we could offer to replace the present agreement by an exchange of notescontinuing the provisions of the Fisheries Agreement and giving the Soviet Government the right to maintain a trade delegation in London, which is in the interests of both countries^On the basis of such a modus Vivendi we could allow ma matters todevelop for the time being, trusting that self-interest and the fear of restrictions on their exports will make the SovietGovernment continue taking our good to the same extent as inthe past, viz: insofar as the prices and credit facilities offered make purchases here convenient.  Moreover credits are probably more important to tho Russians and muoh more effective in increasing our exports to them than any other of the advantages which they obtain from the existing agreement.     The question is whether we should go further and try tomake a new commercial agreement, which would seoure fromRussia an undertaking to purchase more British good whilstcontaining no provision preventing the application of theCanadian Agreement.
     The difficulties in-securing these two aims simuitaneoual.are Obvious.  If we could be euro that article 21 of theCanadian Agreement would not have to be implemented, thepower of prohibiting imports might be a useful lever to securemore Russian orders.  But,  as it stands, the Ottawacommitment is an indefinite obligation, which might haveto be implemented at any time.   If we are to negotiate with Russia with any prospect of success, we should haveto secure some arrangement which would make an appeal by the Canadians to article 21 at least unlikely.  Themost hopeful procedure would be to arrange with ourTimber trade that they would obtain an increased proportionof their requirements from the British Empire and thusobviate complaints from Canada.  It seems desirablethat the possibilities in thiB direction should be carefully explored before we enter into negotiations withthe Soviet Government.     A further difficulty is that the Soviet Government bytheir policy of buying on credit could do comparatively little to increase orders from the United Kingdom inthe immediate future, except against increased creditswhich it may be undesirable to give.  This would notnecessarily preclude our getting an agreement under whichthe Soviet Government would undertake to spend in theUnited Kingdom (on goods, sex^vices or payment of credits)the full equivalent of the exports we take, after a periodof 18 months or two years,  when their existing commitmentshave run off.  If, as we believe, the British markotis essential to the Soviet Government, some arrangement on these lines might be feasible especially if our creditpolicy could be stabilised.
     Negotiations on these lines would undoubtedly bearduous and the first alternative - of a modus Vivendipending developments - is simpler.  The argument infavour of attempting a wider negotiation io that,  if wesimply denounce the existing agreement, the SovietGovernment - whatever it ultimately may find itadvantageous to do -  will probably declare that it intends to place no orders here and will do its utmost to  stir upthe British manufacturers interested&quot; in Russian orders to attack the Government&apos;s policy.  It would be moredifficult for them to make political trouble in this way if,at the same time as we denounce the existing agreement,  weoffer to enter into negotiations on the situation.     This does not necessarily mean that we should ourselvespropose a detailed new agreement.   Generally speaking,  therights given in the present Agreement are of considerablevalue to the Russians, in that they give equality oftreatment in this country to Russian nationals and Russianships, and are, broadly speaking,  of no value whatever tothis country since, for example, it is clearly useless tohave equality of rights in shipping matters in Russian^ports if the Russian Government who are the sole importersdo not in fact employ our ships.  Further, the Russiansset considerable value from the point of view of prestigeon having a comprehensive trade agreement with use   the probability is, therefore, that if when denouncing theexisting agreement, we offer to negotiate, the Russians  will themselves take the initiative of  proposing a completenew agreement.  This would give us an initial tacticaladvantage which night easily be of considerable value iri
     the Bubeequent.negotiations.  We can then put forward our     demands for additional purchases- of British goods and     chartering of British ships and see what satisfaction can     he got.  If after negotiation it is fount?, impossible to     conclude a satisfactory agreement on a v;i e banis,  we can     fall back on the modus viver:&amp;i proposed by the Foreign     Office.          It is suggested therefores-       (l)   that the present agreement should bo denounced;       (2)   that, at the same time,mwe should offor to enter             into negotiations with the Soviet Government an             to tho situation thus arising;       (3)   that we may rely on the Russians asking for  a                                  v             fresh agreement ana in that case we p&amp;ould             explore all possibilities of securing some             improvement in our balance of accounts with             them;       (4)   failing any wider arrangement, we can fall             back on the modus Vivendi suggested by the             Foreign Office0                                W.R.Board of Trade,   8th October, 1932.-&quot;.-:-f.&quot;;.;:r-&apos;. .......
    Negotiation of a new Anglo-Soviet Commercial, Agreement.                   Note by the Foreign OfficeeDcrvjnc.i at ion cf tho Temporary Commercial Agreement of April,   1. The Cabinet Committee on Trade with Russia recommended in May last (CcP,.169/32) that the existing Commercial Agreementwith the UaSoScRc should be denounced, and that a freshAgreement should be negotiated, the terms of which would bedetermined by the policy adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentfollowj.ng upon the Ottawa Conference.   Action on these recommendations was deferred by the Cabinet,   2a The probable effects of a denunciation of the existing agreement and of a restriction of Soviet imports to theUnited Kingdom were exhaustively discussed in the Committee&apos;sreport and there is nothing to add to their observations onthese two subjects,   3. The question of a new agreement remains to be consideredsince as a consequence of Article 21 of the Ottawa Agreementwith Canada,  the Anglo-Soviet Commercial Agreement of April,1930, will shortly be denounced,,   Article 21 runs as followss-        &quot;This Agreement is made on the express  condition     that,  if either Government is satisfied that any     preferences hereby granted in respect of nny particular     class of commodities are likely to be frustrated fn whole.     or in part by reason of the creation of maintenance     directly or indirectly of prices for such  class  of     commodities through state action on the part of  nny     foreign country,  that Government hereby declares that it     will exercise the powers which it now has  or will     hereafter take to prohibit the entry from  such foreign
     country directly or indirectly of such commodities     into its country for such time as may he necessary to     make effective and to maintain the preferences hereby     granted by it.&quot;                            HPWill the Soviet be prepared to negotiate a new commercial agreement?   4. In the absence of precise knowledge of the reactions of the Soviet Government to the fact of denunciation, or ofthe extent to Y/hich they may be prepared to meet the wishes of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the discussion of a new Agreementmust be largely speculative,,   5. 8o far as concerns the United Kingdom a  new Agreement,must, in the light of the Ottawa Agreement, aim at     (a) securing for His Majesty&apos;s Government a free hand           to prohibit any class of imports from the UaS,S,R.           if they consider that the necessity for doing so           arises under Article Si of the Ottawa Agreement;                             and     (b) increasing, or at least maintaining the present           volume and value of United Kingdom exports.to the           U.S.S,R. which for the last three years have           averaged about  7 million per annum.   6. The first of these objectives would entail the totalomission from any new Agreement of any provision accordingmost-favoured-nation treatment to Soviet goods in the matterof import prohibitions and restrictions.   It would probablybe desirable at the same time to omit also most-favoured-nation rights in the matter of customs duties.   This is amatter which the Soviet Government would be bound to regardseriously in view of their dependence on the United kingdom market,mnmm
                                              24 Q     7.  The second has been the constant aim of HisMajesty&apos;s Government since the resumption of diplomatic relations in 1929.     8.  The question at once arises whether the twoobJeotive;3 can be attained at one and the same time,and whether the Soviet Government would be willing tonegotiate on the new basis,     9,  The events of 1927 oould be cited as showing that any interruption in the normal course ofpolitical and commercial relations between the twooountries merely results in a drastlo decrease of Sovietpurohases in the United Kingdom;  and though theposition is now different, in that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would have the power to close the british market, which is essential for the success of theFive Tear Plan, (as stated in paragraphs 13 and 14), theSoviet Government might act on the assumption that we wouldhesitate to use that power, In view of its possible consequences, as set out In the subsequent paragraphs.     10.  Should His Majesty&apos;s Government, having soughtand obtained the necessary powers from Parliament, find themselves obliged, In deference to the wishes of Canada,actually to proceed to a prohibition of the entry intothe United Kingdom of any olass of Soviet goods (e.g. timber), it is not impossible that the Soviet government might follow either or both of the following two coursesj       (a) curtail their purchases in the United           Kingdom by way of reprisal,                        and/or       (b) -accept the inevitable and then declare           that, as a direct consequence of the act&quot;1&apos;c           of His Majesty1s Government, they are           unable to meet their oommitnients abroad *
     11. Neither of these dangers can he wholly discountedat the present time.   It is well known that the SovietGovernment are at present encountering very great difficultyin the accomplishment of the Five Year Plan, espeoially inregard to agriculture.   Bad trade, low commodity prices,and mismanagement in regard to agriculture are allcontributory causes.   In the circumstances therefore theSoviet Government might he sorely tempted to attributetheir partial failure directly to the action of His Maj.esty&apos;sGovernment - and the temptation to do so would be almostirresistible if, for some other reason, they found themselvesunable to meet their heavy external commitments which are known to fall due within the next year.   Further, if partialdefault should prove to be unavoidable, the Soviet government might endeavour temporarily to maintain their credit elsewhereby dishonouring their British obligations and applying theforeign exchange thus released to the satisfaction of their other creditors.     IS. If, alternatively, the Soviet Government were todefault all round, (even partially) the effect on Germanfinances might be disastrous, as Soviet Russia is Germany&apos;schief market and owes Germany at present some  60 millionsterling.     13o On the other hand it may equally well be argued thatthe present position differs materially from that of 1927.  Atthat time, the Five Year Plan had not come into operation;the sacrifices it entailed were unknown;  the Soviet Governmentwere not pledged to stand or fall by the success or failxireof any particular economic policy;  and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment&apos;s guarantee of Soviet credit was not available.
   14. Given that the Soviet Government cannot at this timeof day lightly abandon the huge task to which they have settheir hand, without disastrous consequences to themselves,it seems most unlikely that, merely for the sake of a gesture of protest against the termination of the TemporaryCommercial Agreement, they would jeopardise the market whichabsorbs about one-third of their total exports and soprovides a large proportion of the foreign exchange needed for the fulfilment of the present Five Year Plan and theaccomplishment of its almost inevitable successorw   15, If this is so it is possible that after denunciation of the Agreement a new modus Vivendi might be reached underwhich the Soviet Government might purchase considerable quantities of British goods.   16. The extent to which they would be able to do so would depend finally on the following considerations:-     (a) how far their purchasing power is curtailed by any           prohibition of Soviet imports into the United           Kingdom,                               and     (b) whether it is possible to stabilise the conditions           under which the credit guarantee of His Majesty&apos;s           Government is accorded.   17. As regards (a) it is fairly clear that Canada looks  atleast for some definite advantage over foreign competition in selling her timber* in the United Kingdom market.Failing a general rise in world prices therefore, it is* Timber.   The Economic Committee of the League of Nations    in a report of May, 1932,  pointed out that timber had    become an international problem and that no way out of    the present difficulty would be found without inter-    national co-operation.   A conference of timber producing    countries was held at Vienna in June, 1932,  but it was    ineffective owing to the refusal of the Soviet Government     to co-operate with other countries.  It might be advisable to consider,  in the light of the    Ottawa Agreements, whether international organisation    and regulation con be applied to timber as in the case    of meat.
evident that this phase of the question will need very careful handling, if Canada is not to he satisfied at the expense  ofthe British consumer,   Timber is by far the largest singleitem among Russian exports to this country, comprising one-third of their total;   and if the Soviet Government, could besatisfied that they would not he deprived of the british market for their timber, they might go a long way towards meeting us in the matter of orders for British industry.   18.   The question of credits, however, must remain of atleast equal importance; and this needs separate treatment,                             III.Question of Credits.   19.   For the realisation of the Soviet Governmentseconomic programme the most essential need is credit.    the strain which results from Russia&apos;s effort to industrialiseherself out of income would he greatly relieved by even a modest loan.  The absence of orders from other sources for industrial plant and machinery may well tempt othercountries, notably the United States of America,to float sucha loan, failing a quick recovery of trade during the coming winter.   The temptation is likely to be resisted until thepolicy of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards imports from russia is defined, but if it once becomes evident that the soviet union will continue to have reasonably free access to this market, money at present lying idle inth&amp;:.United States ofAmerica and elsewhere might well find profitable employmentin the U.S.3.R.  It is perhaps significant in this connectionthat there has recently been a marked change in the attitudeof the City towards the discounting of Soviet bills.   Acceptinhouses which formerly refused to handle even bills guaranteed                                  -13-
by the Export Orerlits Guarantee Department are now doing so.   20.  If Russia should succeed in obtaining financialfacilities from the United States of America, Prance or else-where, the incentive to buy in the United Kingdom which ourcredit facilities provide would be very much weakened,  and tosecure our fair share of orders we should have to rely,almost entirely on the threat of restriction of ourindispensable market,   21.  drastic restriction of Russia&apos;s market in thiscountry would be a two-edged weapon, as already shown.   TheRussians are doubtless aware of this, and in negotiatingthey would probably rely upon the assumption that His majesty&apos;sGovernment would hesitate to use it.  A continuance of  credit facilities seems therefore essential unless we are to riskbeing driven to put the threat of restriction  into practice.But on the other hand, an offer of credit facilities will not by itself be sufficient to secure a reasonable balance  of anglo-Russian trade, since Germany seems determined to  outbidus in the amount and length of her credits.  22.  If, after denunciation of the Agreement, a continuousflow of Russian orders is to be maintained, credits wouldhave to be available on a more permanent footing than atpresent (the statutory power of the Board of Trade to giveexport credit guarantees will expire in March 1935 unlessrenewed meanwhile).   23.  An  -arrangement of this kind would not necessarilyexclude some scheme of compensation, by which imports fromRussia were set off in some form against credits for exportsto Russia.   It is unlikely, however, that it would bepossible to institute a complete clearing-house arrangement whereby the extent of Soviet sales in the United kingdom would be determined by the extent of their purchases.  This
Paragraph 2 of the Protocol to the existing Agreement says:-* &quot; ..... trade between the United Kingdom and the U.S.S-R.shall be eligible for consideration on the same basis as trade between the United Kingdom and other foreign countries inconnection with any legislating or administrative measures wh&apos;;are or may be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom for the granting of credits to facilitate such trade.That is to say, that in considering any given transaction,regard shall be had to financial and commercial considerationsonly.&quot;method of improving the Anglo-Soviet trade balance v/asexamined in a memorandum submitted to the Cabinet Committeeon Trade with Russia last January.   Briefly the principalobjections to it are as follows:-     (a) it would be very difficult to administer.     (b) it would be strongly resisted by the Soviet Government           because (i) its rigidity would restrict their           financial freedom of action and might easily           precipitate default, (ii) it would be resented by           Russia&apos;s other creditors.   24. An agreement or tacit understanding regarding the stabilisation of credit conditions, preferably over a long period, would probably go a long way to make the SovietGovernment amenable.   Admittedly the question is a domesticone and one on which His Majesty&apos;s Government might not foeljustified in committing themselves to a foreign Governmentin writing.   But there is a precedent actually existing inthe Protocol50 to the present Commercial Agreement.   This hasnot given rise to any real difficulty in practice.                            IV.Future Procedure-  Form and Scope of the new Agreement.   25. It will be seen from the above that if the denunciation of the Temporary Commercial Agreement of 1930 is followed, asit will probably be, by His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s seeking andobtaining the necessary powers from Parliament to prohibitimports from the U.S.S.R. in certain circumstances, the merefact that His Majesty&apos;s Government will be able  at any
moment to use their power may be sufficient to induce tneSoviet Government to make the best of the situation thuscreated and negotiate a new agreement.   26. The Cabinet Committee did not formulate any definite proposals regarding the form and scope of such an agreement,and it will be advisable to consider this question now.   27. In recoimaending that a new agreement should be negotiated,the Committee possibly envisaged scrapping the present agreementcompletely and replacing it by one that would endeavour to bindthe Soviet Government to buy more British goods.   This will prove difficult for the reasons outlined above, and experiments in the same direction tried by other Governments (e.g. Latvia)have proved failures, though they had not, of course, the uniquebargaining power of this country.   Nevertheless, it seemsworth trying, as there is apparently no other means of preventing Germany from keeping the bulk of Russian orders bythe offer of extravagant credit facilities.   28. On the other hand, it is clear from the Committee^report that, apart from the most-favoured-nation clauses ofArticle 1 of the existing agreement, they saw no objection tothe remaining clauses.   They pointed, however, to the danger that denunciation of the Commercial Agreement on our side would almost inevitably be followed by a Soviet denunciation of the fisheries Agreement of May, 19-30, from which British interestsdraw solid advantages.   29. One way out of the difficulty would be to endeavour to save the Fisheries Agreement by offering, as a quid pro quo,  toretain in any new agreement Article 2 of the existing one,which gives the Soviet Government the right to have a trade delegation in London and defines the Delegation^ legal status.This Article had worked well in practice, is indispensable tothe Soviet Government, and is advantageous from the point ofview of the British trader.
   30. There would thus he considerable advantage in making provision for the continued existence of the Trade Delegationby an exchange of notes which could^be worded on lines similarto those of Article 2 of the Temporary Agreement of 1930.    Ifthis were supplemented by some^ understanding between theAdvisory Committee of the Export Credits Guarantee department and the Soviet Trade Delegation fcr the stabilisation of credit facilities, the necessity for a new formal agreement would perhaps not arise for the moment.   31. In any case, an exchange of notes as outlined above would leave open the channel for continued trade with the SovietGovernment and an  opportunity would thus be afforded, before proceeding to negotiate a new agreement, if this were eventuallyfound to be necessary, to see how the Soviet Government intend to behave in the new conditions created by the denunciation ofthe old agreement and the taking of the powers envisaged by theagreementB made in Ottawa.Debts and Claims.   32. Any reopening of negotiations with the Soviet Governmentis likely to arouse a demand in Great Britain for satisfactionfor the pre-revolution debts and claims.   It will be necessaryto decide whether anything can be done to get satisfaction, andif nothing can be done, what reasons are to be given for notbringing pressure to bear on the Soviet for this object at a mount when commercial relations between the two countries arobeing revised.   The Soviet attitude is that they will givecompensation to British claimants only in return for  extendedcredits.   ThiB might be one way of dealing with the questionbut it has hitherto not found favour here.   33. Another suggestion - repeatedly suggested to Mr. Baldwinby Mr, Reddaway of Manchester and supported in Parliament - was for a levy on Russian ealeB in this country to be paid into a

It is conceivable that if action is taken to prohibitRussian imports of e.g. timber, on the grounds set out in theCanadian Agreements  Russia might boycott imports of UnitedKingdom goods so far as she is able to buy the goods she requiresfrom other . sources of supply such as Germany or the United States.The extent of the resulting injury to United Kingdom exporttrade may be judged in the light of recent trade figures whichare as follows:-     Total Exports of United Kingdom goods to Russia^                                                thousand.        19^9..................................   3,743        1930..................................   6,772        1931..................................   7,291        First half of 1931....................   3,241        First half of 1932....................   4,721     The composition of our export trade to Russia for the year1931 is shown in the following statement:-                                             &apos;000        &apos;000Food, Drink and Tobacco................. .                421Raw Materials (mainly wool and  woollen rags).. .........................                349Manufactured goods,  Machinery and parts.....................  4,418  Iron and Steel Manufactures.............    807  Nickel..................................    152  Ammonium compounds......................    149  All other manufactures..................    917             Total Manufactures...........              6 .443             Total Exports................              7,291    It is clear from the above figures that any diversion of orders from the United Kingdom to other sources of supply would be mostnoticeable in its effect on our exports of machinery.   The exportsof machinery to Russia in 1931 accountod in fact for nearly 14 percent, of the exports of machinery to all destinations.  Russia is
moreover at present  the principal marKet for machine tools and the effect of the loss  of  this market would he particularly serious on this branch of the engineeringtrade.Board of Trade.-SO-
                        ANNEX III.         RUSSIAN IMPORTS INTO THE UNITED KINGDOM.     The question should also he considered, whether Russia,in anticipation of imports of some classes of goods beingprohibited on the termination of the Russian Trade Agreementafter six months&apos; notice, might seek the disposalof such goods in the interval at all costs in substantial quantities.     The particular commodities to which Mr. Bennett referredas being those in regard to which he was most concerned werewheat,  timber and canned salmon.Wheat.     In this case forestalling by Russia can probably be ruled out altogether as it is understood that Russia is unlikely tobe in a position to export any large quantities of wheat inthe coming cereal year.Timber.     The value of our imports of wood and timber from Russia in1931 was about  7,500,000 and of this about  1,000,000represents pit-props on which Canada gets no preference andthe question of prohibition does not therefore arise.   Verylittle timber, however, is shipped from Russia during thewinter months.   The following figures shov/ the aggregatemonthly values of the chief classes&apos;&quot; of tixaber imported fromRussia into the United Kingdom since 1st January, 1930t-* Hewn and sawn soft timber and pit-props.

Stocks available at the ports  are not known, but by thetime the trade agreement has been denounced and  chartering andloading arranged there can hardly be much  opportunity for anyserious forestalling.   Further,  the agreement between theRussians and the United Kingdom timber trade is  reported to contain an undertaking to confine exports  to Great Britain toa maximum quantity of 450,000 standards, shipments being fromRussian ports between April 1st and December 31st, 1932, with a  *reservation permitting a maximum shipment  of 6,000 standardsbefore 1st April from Murmousk and/or Leningrad.   It is, ofcourse, impossible to say how this  undertaking may be affectedby any proposed prohibition of imports.Canned Salmon.     According to the Board of Trade returns the monthly figuresof imports of canned salmon from Russia since  1st January, 1930,are as follows:-
	1930.	1931.	1932.	 f000	5&apos;000 !	;3&apos;000	52	26	7	26	43	39	14	-	2	-	1 2	2	-	3	3	-	-	-	-	-	-	1	-	-	-	-	-	394	949	-	1,613	504		570	192	-        The bulk of the year&apos;s pack is thus shipped in the last   three months of the year and practically nothing is exported   during the six months April-September.   These figures indicate   that the pack is sold as soon as it has been tinned and that  there   are unlikely to be old stocks available for shipment in the next   few months.   Moreover, the great bulk of the Siberian pack is in   any case shipped to the United Kingdom.  It seems probable there-   fore that the imports to be expected in the next few months   should not be on a much greater scale than in the last few years.        It should be borne in mind in this connection that the   greater portion of the imports classified as Russian might more   correctly be described, except on geographical grounds, as   Japanese.  Following the Russo-Japanese war, the greater part of   the fishing rights in the Kamchatka area (where most of the   Siberian salmon is found) were ceded to the Japanese,and it is   understood from reliable trade sources that in 1930 over 70 per   cent, of the canned salmon classified as Russian should properly   be termed Japanese.  It seems possible, therefore,  that the   &quot;Russian&quot; article in the Canadian Agreement might not be   applicable to a large proportion of the imports of  canned salmon   shown as coming from Russia,  since the price of the Japanese   product is not governed by State action.of Trade,                          &quot;23&quot;
