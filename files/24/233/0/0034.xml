ffOCUKEKT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC ^TBaTY&apos;8 GOVBRNMEHT.                         CABINET.           The Ottawa Agreements and Impending Tariff              Negotiations with Foreign Countries.            (Reference; GabInet,48(52) Conclusion 2)       Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.   1. The Ottawa Agreements limit the right of the UnitedKingdom Government to reduce the duties on foreign goods ofvarious kinds below the levels specified in the Agreements.Apart from certain textile products and vegetable oilsspecified in the Agreement v/ith India, the goods on which  weare precluded from reducing the duties consist almost entirely of produce,  i.e. foodstuffs and raw materials including metals^.Thus the Agreements hamper us hardly at all in our negotiationswith industrial countries such as Germany and France, from whichwe import in the main manufactures, but limit substantially the.scope of the concessions we can make to countries such as  the scandinavian countries and Argentina which mainly send usproduce.   Argentina is also affected by the regulation of theimports of chilled and frozen meat into the United Kingdomagreed on at Ottawa; Denmark and Sweden may be seriously affected by the quota scheme for bacon now under considerationindependently of Ottawa.   2. The more important commitments entered into affectingour negotations with the latter group of countries (Denmark,Sweden, Norway, Argentina) may be briefly summarised asfollowe:-   3. Chilled and Frozen Beef, Mutton and Lambr     We are not committed to duties on any of these productsbut have undertaken to regulate foreign imports for a periodof 18 months beginning next January and thereafter for the536(52).Copy No.3*
period of the Agreement (i.e. till August 1937) unless other arrangements are mutually agreed.   Foreign imports of frozenmutton and. lamb are to &quot;be progressively reduced during the18 months till in the last quarter (April-June, 1934) they arenot to exceed 65H of the corresponding imports in the &quot;baseperiod, while the imports of foreign chilled beef are notreduced but are not to be allowed to increase.   4. The foreign countries mainly affected are Argentina andto a less degree Uruguay (no European country ia concerned),the value of the imports of chilled beef from Argentina in 1931being  17,400,000 and those of frozen beef and frozen mutton and lamb being  5,400,000.   5. Bacon.     Pending  . a decision of policy on the regulation scheme now under consideration it is impossible to indicate the effects on our tariff negotatlons with the foreign countries concerned,though those negotiations will no doubt be hampered by the pledge given to Canada of free entry for Canadian bacon andham  up to 2,500,000 cwts. per annum (about one-fifth of our total consumption).   We imported only 122,000 cwts. from canada in 1931, but 637,000 in 1927.   The value of baconimported in 1931 was  33,150,000 and no less than two-thirdswas supplied by Denmark.   Sweden is also substantiallyinterested in the bacon trade, the value of the importstherefrom in 1931 being  1,710,000.   As with meat, it ispresumed that no import duty will be imposed.   6. Butter.     Under the Ottawa Agreements an import duty of 15/- percwt. (roughly equivalent to 15;-- ad valorem at present prices)is to be imposed on all foreign butter.   Denmark is theprincipal foreign source ^15,640,000 in 1931) but Sweden( 1,270,000) and Argentina ( 2,050,000) are also substantially
affected.   It is worth noting that if the price of butterrises substantially (a not  unlikely contingency) the burdenof the specific duty may become not appreciably greater thanthat of tho ad valorem duty which it replaces.   Moreover the specific duty will bear less hardly on the relatively high price Danish butter than on most other foreign butter.   7. Eggs.     Specific duties (varying according to the weight of theeggs) roughly equivalent to 15&apos;  ad valorem at present prices are to be substituted for the 10f- ad valorem duty.,   Denmarkis the principal foreign country concerned ( 4,400,000 in1931).   There are relatively small imports from Sweden, norway and Argentina.   The eggs coming from Denmark, are mainly large and it is possible that the Danes may suggest an increase,beyond the amount to which we are committed to the Dominions,of the duty on the smaller eggs in order to help  their tradein large eggs.   8. Fish.     Under the Agreement with Canada we are committed not toreduce the existing lOf duty on fresh or canned fish.   /Onchilled or frozen salmon there is to be a duty of l-jd. perTbjJ7   Norway and Denmark are both interested in fresh fish,the imports from each amounting to about  1,000,000 per annum,and Norway is also interested in canned fish.   Both thesecountries would probably welcome a proposal that we should undertake not to increase the existing duty of 10$.   9. Wheat.     We are committed to a duty of 2/- per quarter on foreignwheat (equivalent to rather less than 10$ at present prices)This duty may be suspended if the effect is to increase theprice in this country above the world price, but thisproviso would not be helpful from the point of view of                              -3-
                                                       6 0 6negotiating with foreign countries.    Argentina is closely concerned, the value of the imports  in 1931 therefrom being 5,100,000 (although as recently as  1929 it was as high as 22,900,000).   It is presumed that  the chief effect of theduty will be to replace foreign by Empire wheat in ourmarkets, and Empire by foreign wheat in other markets withoutany serious effect on prices-   10. Timber.     w&apos;e are pledged to Canada not to  reduce the existing 10,^duty on foreign timber of kinds in which Canada is interested.This doeB not apply to pit-props, which are free of duty.Sweden sends us large quantities of  timber axid Norway is also an exporter on a considerable scale.   In 1930 we imported from sweden timber, other than pit-props, to the value of  4,800,000and pit-props to the value of  660,000; we also imported wood pulp (which is free of duty) to the  value of  3,800,000.   from norway we imported timber (other than pit-props) to the valueof  1,400,000, pit-props,  140,000,  and wood pulp  2,400,000.   11. Linseed.     By the Agreement with India we  are pledged to impose a duty of 10&apos;/. ad valorem on foreign linseed.  Linseed comesmainly from Argentina, the value from that country in 1951 being 2,000,000.   12. Denmark, Sweden and Norway are low tariff countries andthe main object of our negotiations should be to secure the stabilisation of the existing low rates of duty.   In general we probably have little to gain by pressing for reductions in existing duties and we should be met by counter-demands for reductions in our duties which might well prove embarrassing.No doubt there will be a few cases where definite reductionsor adjustments of duty would be of value to one party and could be considered by the other.   In general, however,stabilisation of duties rather than their reduction should, be
the key-note of our negotiations with this group of countries.   13- As regards concessions from Denmark there is a specialpoint which should be kept in mind.   During the last yearDenmark has been directing her imports by means of licenceswith a view partly to the maintenance of the exchange, andpartly to increasing the United Kingdom share of her market.Since tariffs were introduced in this country Denmark has beenalarmed about her market here which is far more valuable toher than any other, and she has been endeavouring by thismeans to strengthen her position with a view to negotiationswith us.   The policy adopted has been so far successful that imports from this country have increased this year while those from all other countries, including Germany who previously hada much larger share of the Danish market than we had, have declined very greatly.   The system of import restrictions isdue to come to an end on October 31st, but there is apossibility of its extension for a further period.   This wouldbe of substantial value to British trade because the longerthe trade is directed in this way the greater is the prospect ofits continuing to run in the new channels when the restrictionscome to be removed.   14* Outside the range of tariffs there is one matter on whichwe should press for special advantages.   Even since the coalstoppage of 1926 Sweden, Norway and Denmark have imported asubstantial part of their requirements of coal from Poland.There is no duty on coal and a tariff preference would seem tobe out of the question.   But a large amount of coal is used bythe State railways and by Public Authorities such as gas works,and it might be possible to obtain some degree of preferencein public contracts for our coal*   Indeed, the Danish MinisterhaB already intimated in informal discussion that he may be able
to arrange something of the kind, as part of a negotiationwhich was satisfactory to Denmark in other respects.    &quot;,7e havealso impressed on the Swedes the importance which we  attach to coal o   15e It may he useful to indicate in rough outline  the kindof concessions which we might he able to offer to Denmark,Sweden and Norway there having been already some informal discussion with the representatives of the first two  countries.   16. As regards Denmark, bacon is of outstanding importance,accounting for just about half the value of our total importsfrom Denmark.   Until something is known of the scheme nowunder consideration by the Pig Commission it is, of course,impossible to say how the future of the Danish bacon industryis likely to be affected by measures which may be taken inthis country; but at least we may be able to offer Denmark aguarantee that no duty shall be imposed on their bacon.   Butteraccounts for nearly two-thirds of the remainder of our importsfrom Denmark and here we could offer that the duty will not beincreased beyond 15/- per cwt.   Eggs and fish are other important items in our imports from Denmark.   As regards eggs,we might offer not to increase the duties agreed on at Ottawafor the larger kinds of eggs and possibly Denmark may ask foran increase in the duty on the smaller eggs beyond the Ottawafigure, since these smaller eggs come mainly from other foreign countries and compete with the larger eggs from denmark.   As regards fish, we could offer to stabilise theduty at 10% ad valorem as provided for in the ottawa agreements.   It should be emphasised, however, that baconwill be the key to the negotiations and that, if measures are adopted in this country which threaten to interferesubstantially with the Danish bacon trade, the prospects ofan agreement carrying advantages to our export trade will be seriously prejudiced.
   17o Sweden is known to be anxious to obtain definiteconcessions in respect of paper (especially wrapping paper onwhich the duty has just been increased from 20f. to 25&apos;/ on therecommendation of the Import Duties Advisory Committee) andcertain special kinds of iron and steel and manufactures thereof,made by the charcoal process.   The value per ton is relatively high and duties on an ad valorem basis preBS heavily on ito   The Swedes are anxious to secure the substitution of specific duties for the present ad valorem duties on thesekinds of iron and steel.   The effect on our own iron and steelindustry of such a concession is being considered.   18. Apart from special concessions of this kind, Sweden would no doubt welcome a guarantee that no duty would be imposed onpit props and wood pulp, which are both now on the Free LiBt.They may also be expected to welcome a guarantee that theexisting 10% duty on timber stabilised by the Agreement with canada shall not be increased.   It may be noted that Swedenmay also gain some incidental advantage if imports of Russiantimber are restricted under the Agreement with Canada, but theprospects here are probably too nebulous to be of realadvantage in our negotiations with Sweden.   Sweden is alsointerested in bacon, butter and eggs, which have been referredto under Denmark above-.   19. Norway&apos; s chief concern in this market are her importsof fish and fish oil, paper, timber and wood pulp.   All ofthese have already been mentioned in connection with denmark and Sweden except fish oil;  Norway sends at present much thelargest proportion of the United Kingdom imports of cod liveroil and if the agreement with Newfoundland comes into force this trade will be adversely affected.   Unless some concessioncan be made on wrapping paper, there appears to be very little
                                                                 2o                                                                  a A  that we can offer to Norway apart from consolidation;  but sho     would certainly welcome consolidation of the present duty     on timber and fish and of free entry for wood pulp.        20. In Argentina the conditions under vhich our trade is     carried on are quite different.:   The duties imposed on our     goods are on the whole at a high level and our object should     be to obtain substantial reductions of duty on the goods of     major interest to us.-   It has bu;en hinted that Argentina     might even be prepared to consider giving our goods preference     over those of other countries provided she could secure     sufficiently satisfactory terms for her meat.   Chilled beef     and frozen beef, mutton and lamb account for nearly half the     value of our imports from Argentina, and chilled beef is much     more important than frozen meato   Under the Ottawa Agreements     the imports of foreign frozen meat are to be severely cut     down, while those of chilled beef are to be stabilised at the     existing level.   It seems possible, therefore, that the     Argentines might attach considerable importance to a guarantee     that imports of chilled beef will continue to be allowed up     to the quantity hitherto imported and that no duty will bo     imposed on It.   wheat, maize and linseed are also of great     importance to Argentina and here we might be able to offer     the continuance of free entry for maize, other than white     maize, and a guarantee not to increase, beyond the level of     2/- per quarter and 10% ad valorem fixed by  the Ottawa     Agroements, the duties on wheat  and linseed.   The     stabilisation of the duties on butter, oats  and canned meat     might also be welcome to Argentina.   It is, however, to tho     question of meat that over-riding  importance will be attached.a of  Trade, 6th  October, 1932.
