&quot;&apos; * Printed for the Cabinet.  September  1932.SECRET.                                                Copy No.    9CP. 332(32).CABINET.COAST  DEFENCE.            MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR  AIR.    AS my colleagues will  shortly be considering the conclusions reached by theCommittee of Imperial Defence on the recommendations of the Coast defence sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 370-C), I wish to  draw their attention to apoint of  some  importance  to  the  Air  Ministry,  which  arises  out  of  therecommendation that  arrangements for  progressive training and graduatedpractical  trials  with a  view to establishing the  principles  and  practice ofco-operation by the Royal Air Force in all branches of coast defence should be approved.    There is, as the Chief  of  the Air Staff explained to the Committee ofImperial Defence, at present  a shortage of air units which could be  used for thepurpose of these trials, and, in accordance with the suggestion then made bythe Prime Minister, the  question of finding  means  for  implementing thisrecommendation has  been discussed  with the Permanent  Secretary  of  theTreasury.    The solution proposed  is  that two squadrons, nominally forming part of theHome Defence Force, but which are at present  not fully effective,  as they areincorporated  in the establishment of an Experimental  Station, should be brought up  to  strength  by utilising accommodation and personnel which have  been rendered temporarily surplus to requirements owing to deferment of the HomeDefence expansion programme.    No increase  in  the  authorised expenditure for  the current year  will be involved, and, though of  course there will be some increase in maintenance costs in the future, this will  be less  than  would have been  the case if  it had been necessary to embark upon  the formation of entirely new units.  Moreover, thetime is, in any event, long overdue for  these squadrons to be put on  a  fully effective basis, having regard  to the fact that they have for years past figured assuch in  all returns to Parliament  and  the League,  so that an  increase inmaintenance costs for this purpose would, in any case, be inevitable.    The proposal involves  no increase  in the number  of units these squadronsfigure in such publications as  the Air Force List like any other regular squadronsdespite  the fact that, for various reasons, the  necessary action to make themeffective has been postponed or in the figures of first-line strength communicatedto the Disarmament  Conference, and no difficulty arises in connection with the armaments Truce.    It is, in fact, an expedient for meeting a new commitment by making use ofexisting  resources, which will be put on  a properly  effective, instead of theirpresent more or less nominal, footing;  we shall simultaneously be remedying an unsatisfactory situation and  providing for this new Coast Defence  requirementon the most economical basis  possible.   Its disadvantage from the point  of viewof the Air Ministry  is that two  squadrons, which ought to be allotted to HomeDefence as their primary role, will be employed on a service which will to a largeextent deprive them  of specialised training for that role, and thus  temporarilydeplete the already inadequate number of fully trained Home Defence Squadrons.       [7684]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
This disadvantage I am, however, in the interests of economy prepared to accept,though it may in the future be necessary to reconsider the position.    I propose, therefore, to meet the difficulty of providing the aircraft requiredto implement  the Coast Defence Sub-Committee&apos;s  recommendation by bringingthese two squadrons up to normal establishment forthwith  and diverting them,for the present at  all events, primarily to experiments in  connection with  air co-operation -operation in Coast  Defence.                                                         la.    Air Ministry, September 28, 1932.
