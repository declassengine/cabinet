(intl&apos;d&apos;d)  J.H.T.oninions Office,  September 28th,  1932.
             ANNEX  I.                        Irish Delegation                           to the Assembly of the                                 League of Nations.                              September 26th, 193S.Dear Mr. Thrmas,          I have received your letter of September 14th.          I am at a loss to understand the reasons for your insistence that the Treaty and the Irish FreeState&apos;s membership of the British Commonwealth must  beaccepted as the basis of any discassion directed to thetermination of the present deadlock, since these mattershave not been at issue in the financial dispute betweenthe two Governments.          Arising out ^f the situation created by theTreaty, the present Government of the Irish Free Stateassumed office as the Government of one of the co-equalStates of the British Commonwealth, and as an administration we are bound by pledges to our peoplewhich preclude  secession without an express mandatefrom the electors.   Our views as to the injustice andunwisdom of provisions of the Treaty were indicated inmy Despatch of April 5th, but these matters are not an issue in the present dispute.          I observe with regret that the. assurance that my Government is willing to deposit the moneys in dispute with the Bank for International Settlements inthe event of negotiations being initiated on the basis ofa truce has brought forth one more negative  response from you.   Your objection to the  condition  that the
deposit should he returned to the Irish Free State ifthe negotiations failed, is, to my mind, whollyunreasonable.   You surely do not suggest that the money should be left indefinitely on deposit after thediscussions had been abandoned.   Is it., then, youropinion that a mere refusal of the British Governmentto come to an agreement should decide the issue infavour of Great Britain?   To agree to negotiations onsuch terms would obviously be the surrender of ourclaims at the outset.          I must deny your statement that I haverejected all proposals of the British Government for asolution of the deadlock without surgesting practicablealternatives.   Nor can I accent your disclaimer ofresponsibility for the continuance of the impasse.When arbitration was suggested, I lost no time indeclaring my Government&apos;s willingness to agree, and itwas not I but your Government  that destroyed the hopeof a solution in that direction by insisting on an artificial restriction on the  selection of arbitrators.When the British Government refused to consent to anunrestricted choice of our nominees on the tribunal,I declared the readiness of the Irish Free State to seek agreement by negotiation, only to be met by a newdifficulty with regard to the  disposal  of  the moneysduring the period of discussions.   As  a way out ofthis difficulty I accepted the suggestion of the third party referred to in my last letter that, in the eventof a truce for the period of the negotiations, the
          Irish Free State should deposit the ir.cr.eys v;i th the          Bank for International Settlements;   This also has been          rejected.-                    Your letter contains a further proposal:  that          negotiations re initiated on the basis of the position          as it is, without any preliminary tariff truce.  In theIho te of securing a satisfactory termination of the          dispute, and to prevent the further embitterment of          feeling which the continuance of the present situation is          certain tc engender, the Government  of the Irish Free          State accepts this proposal and is prepared t** appoint          its representatives forthwith.   At the same tine^ I          feel hound to repeat, what I have  already said frequently          in put lie, that in my opinion the  operation cf the          discriminatory tariffs during the  period of the  iisoussi ens          must tend tc create conditions unfavourable tc a  settlement.          The Government of the Irish Free State must envisage  the          severance of all normal  trading relations between the two          countries as a possible  development  of the oresent          situation.   Anxious  as  we are to  avoid this development,          it is our duty  to take  steps  to adjust our economic  life          to meet  it.   If the  special  tariffs  continue,  these  steps          may have  to be  taken  ever,  during  the  progress  of the          negotiations.                                 Faithfully  yours,                                   (Signed) BAM Oil DE VALEEA.Right Hon. J.K. Thomas, MVP.retary  of  State  for Tcrr.ir.ions,Downing Street, London,  S. V.&apos;. 1.
           ANNEX   II.                              September 27th,  1932.Dear Mr, de Valera,          I received your letter of September  26th,to-day.          As I stated in my letter of September 14th,&quot;we are prepared either (l) to refer the question of theLand Annuities to arbitration within the BritishCommonwealth of Nations or (2) to negotiate,  on thebasis either (a) cf the present situation,  or  (b) ofthe restoration of the status quo as it existed beforethe Annuities were withheld, always provided  of course that there is a prospect of finality&quot;,,   (I have,for convenience, inserted numbers and letters  in the sentence above quoted).   Of these alternatives your letter under reply accepts 2 (a) ine. you agree thatwe should negotiate on the question of the Land Annuitiesor the basis of the present situation, provided thatthere is a prospect of finality0          The United Kingdom Government are glad to confirm the agreement thus arrived at and are ready toappoint their representatives to meet the representativesof the Irish  Free State Government provided that wecan be reasonably assured that there is a prospect offinality.   Would it not be convenient to take advantageof your passing through London on your way back from geneva to have a preliminary meeting when we coulddiscuss the point last mentioned and decide as to the
number of representatives, etce          I would remind you that in addition to the land annuities other monies are being withheld by the IrishFree State Government which are claimed by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom to be due from the IrishFree State; so long as this is the case a settlement ofthe dispute with regard to the Land Annuities will notdispose of the reason for imposing the duties at present being levied on imports from the Irish Free State intothis country,,   We have more than once invited you tostate the grounds on which these other payments are beingwithheld, but have not received any such statement from you.  If you desire to include the question of these other payments in the negotiations, we would ask you tostate the grounds on which they are being withheld andthen we should be prepared to consider whether we could agree, if you wished, to their inclusion,,          In the circumstances, you will, I am sure, agreethat no useful purpose would be served by my commenting onthe first four paragraphs of your letter, but it must ofcourse not be assumed that I accept all the views thereexpressed,,                   Yours sincerely,                           (Signed) J, H. T HOMAS.
