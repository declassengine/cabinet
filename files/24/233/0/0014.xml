I circulate, for the information of my colleagues,some notes which I have had prepared in the Board of trade on the advantages accorded immediately under the ottawa agreements in favour of United Kingdom goods.                                        W.R.Board of Trade,   23rd September,  1932
                           I                   100          OTTAWA CONFERENCE RESULTS.Notes on the advantages accorded immediately under   the Ottawa Agreements in favour of the United   Kingdom goods.     The decision which was ultimately reached at the ottawa conference that detailed particulars of the immediate advantages to he conceded &quot;by the various Dominions and India in favour ofBritish goods should he temporarily withheld from publication hasmade it inevitable that the public in this country should he kept in ignorance of the full measure of these advantages.   attention has consequently been concentrated mainly on the provisions in the agreements (notably those with Canada and Australia) whichlook to an eventual modification of the general level of thecustoms tariffs concerned so as to afford to United Kingdomproducers opportunity of reasonable competition with localproducers on the basis of the relative cost of economical and efficient production.   Whilst the acceptance of these principlesmay well prove ultimately to be one of the more important resultsof the Conference it may perhaps be argued that much of theadvantage  to be anticipated must depend on the goodwill of theDominions concerned and the effective operation of the Tribunalswhich will review the existing Customs duties,  and that, whilst the action to be taken under the Agreement by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment is definite and immediate,  these general undertakings&apos;can at best only bear fruit in the future.   It is,  however,  by no means the case that these provisions,  important as theyundoubtedly are, constitute the whole contribution of theDominions in favour of &quot;.mitf,d Kingdom. .trade.       The Agreementsconcluded comprised undertakings in the shape of better treatment for United Kingdom goods which when the necessary steps have beentaken by the various legislatures will have immediate effect.

(Actual).	578.5	106.note:^   The estimates given in the Table for the 3 groupsare on the low side since it has been impossible to secure any separate statistics for certain of the goods concerned and such good have been omitted from the calculation.     It will be seen that on the basis of last  year&apos;s trade over40 per cent, of the imports from the United Kingdom will enjoyimmediately the advantage of lower customs duties than those previously in force, goods to the value of over 8 million dollars          The  object  of  the  following notes is to give sxie measure     of the magnitude and  extent  of these immediate advantages.                                 CANADA.          The  Agreement  with Canada provides for the immediate     modification of  the import duties imposed by Canada on over     200 items.    In  the case  of  83 of these headings the alterations     do not, it  is true, include  any actual reductions in the Duties     to oe levied  on United Kingdom goods, but only increases in the     duties levied on goods  from  competing countries.   In 132 cases,     however,  the duties on  United Kingdom goods are to be reduced,     whilst in no less than  79 of these cases our goods are for the     first time  to enjoy free  entry.          The  estimated  value  of  the trade in the year 1931-2 in goods     coming within each  of these  groups is shown in the following     table:-Values  of Imports into Canada  in  year ended 3lBt March, 1932.
&quot;being admitted free of duty.   Free entry has been secured e.g.,for a considerable number of chemical products,  for all theprincipal classes of vegetable oils, for sheet and plate glass,numerous iron and steel item6, motors and motor cycles,printing and dairy machinery, telegraph, telephone and wirelessapparatus, for all the important classes of linen fabrics andcertain minor cotton and woollen items.   Reduction of theexisting duties will be enjoyed by e.g. the following classes ofUnited Kingdom goods:-  cigarettes and manufactured tobacco,whisky, cotton and woollen goods and hosiery.   There is reasonto think that the Section of the Schedule which relates to Ironand Steel goods will be particularly appreciated by the Iron andSteel trade of this country.   So far as the general run ofcotton and woollen goods are concerned; however, the immediatereductions are of a limited nature, and can only be regarded asaninstalment of the more extensive reductions which it is hoped to secure later as the result of recommendations by the tariff board.     A minor concession which should be of value to UnitedKingdom interests is the reduction by 50% of the duty on UnitedKingdom catalogues, price lists and other advertising matter.     As regards the cases in which the only immediate concessionsis an increase in the duty on foreign goods, it should be notedthat in respect of some of the items the United Kingdom alreadyenjoys free entry in Canada, so that it was only by increasingthe rates of duty on foreign goods that any additional advantagecould be accorded to this country.
                        AUSTRALIA.     The agreement with Australia does not make provisionfor specific reductions in the duties on British goods, a pledge having been given during the last election inAustralia not to make extensive reductions in duties except.on the recommendation of the Tariff Board.     The fact that Australia already possesses a tariff board however (whilst Canada does not) means in effectthat the process of reducing duties though that machinerycan be taken in hand earlier, and in fact reductions of duty which may fairly be attributed to the conclusionof the Ottawa Agreement, have already begun.     Following the preliminary discussions between UnitedKingdom and Australian representatives prior to the ottawa conference, the Commonwealth Government had alreadyrequested the Tariff  Board  to examine and report ona considerable number of the existing duties.  The Boardhas now completed a series of reports,and on the 2ndSeptember the Commonwealth Government brougho into operationreductions in the duties on a number of commodities.  Ithas been estimated that the value of the trade in these items on the basis of the 1950/51 Trade Returns was:-Total Imports,  1,217,000 of which from the United Kingdom 802,000.     It should be noted that the year 19 30-51 was an extremely poor trade year, the value of the total imports into Australia in that year being only 50;^ of the valueof the imports in the previous year.     Among the important classes of goods affected by these reductions are woollen piece goods,  corrugated and galvanisedIron and steel plates  and sheets, cotton tweeds, towels
and towelling, and dynamo electric machines and transformers.     Australia under cock at Ottawa to abolish as soon aspracticable the existing prohibitions on the importation ofcertain goods from the United Kingdom.  All these prohibitionshave in fao t now been already removed as from the 31stAugust, 1932.  The estimated value of the trade in thegoods affected in the year 1928-29 (the period before theprohibitions came into force) is:-  Total Imports  2,589,000,of which from the United Kingdom,  1,228,000.  Examples ofthe goods  concerned are wireless sets and apparatus,sanitary earthenware and iron and steel beams, channels,girders, etc.     A further undertaking by Australia was that, as soon aspracticable the surcharge of 50% of the amount of the dutyimposed on certain goods in 1930 should be removed, and on the31st August surcharges were actually removed from 17 items in the Australian Tariff, the estimated value of the tradeaffected, on the basis of the figures for 1928-29 (when thesurtax was not in force) being:- Total Imports,  3,900,000,of which from the United Kingdom,  2,025,000.  Among thegood3 affected are apparel, leather manufactures andadvertising matter, etc.     Further, Australia undertook to reduce or  to remove  the .existing primage duty of generally 10^ ad valorem (though in certain oases 4fS ad valorem) as soon as  tho finances ofAustralia allowed,!  On the 2nd  September some 35 classes  ofgoods were exempted from the primage duty.  Among, the itemsincluded &quot;were barbed wire and wire netting, farm tractors andother agricultural machinery, mining machinery and certainclasses of iron and steel platea and sheets.
     Apart from actual reductions in the oustoms duties and other obstacles enoountered by United Kingdom trade,a specific undertaking was entered into by Australia at ottawa whioh established a &quot;formula&quot; under which minimummargins of Oustoms tariff  preference are granted forpractically all United Kingdom goods competing in theAustralian market.  In the absence of a, detailed investigation of every item in the Commonwealth Tariff, which it has notyet been possible to carry through, it is not possible tosay what volume of trade is affected by this particularconcession.  In many oases, United Kingdom goods alreadyenjoy the benefit of at least the minimum margins.  In theother cases, it does not necessarily follow that the increaseof the existing preferences up to the prescribed minima willba effected only by inoreases of the duties on foreign goodssince the review of existing protective duties by the Tariff Board   mentioned above may result in a reduction of theduties on particular United Kingdom commodities.     It should be borne in mind that, ignoring the primageduty, which applies to nearly all goods and which, as stated  &quot;above, Australia has undertaken to remove as soon as herfinances allow, a large percentage (from 40fo to 50fj) ofUnited Kingdom goods entering Australia were already duty-free before the Ottawa Conference took place.-G-
NSW ZEALAND.     Apart from a primage duty of Z% ad valorem, about 50$S ofthe imports into New Zealand from the United Kingdom (or about 510 millions worth in a normal year) were already &quot;beforethe Ottawa Conference duty-free.   The primage duty inquestion is not immediately effected &quot;by the results of theConference though New Zealand has in fact undertaken that itehrll not be increased, and shall &quot;be abolished as soon as financial conditions permit.     As regards United Kingdom goods which are dutiable onentry into New  Zealand however, the recent Agreementprovides for an immediate reduction of duty in every case.These goods are now subject to a surtax of 9/40ths (in a few cases l/80th) of the amount of customs duty otherwise payable,.This surtax which amounts on the average to a duty of some5?5 ad valorem will now &quot;be abolished.   In addition, NewZealand will make the following reductions in her basicdutiesmmodity.Present duty.Imports in 1930,New duty.Tot til  From UnitedKingdom,lonery  Rnd ready-i clothing.....ind artificial piece-goods .,30&amp; ad val.(with surtax, 36f?5ad val.)32^$ ed val.    1(with surtax, 39=2%ad val.)32%fc ad val.(with surtax, 3ai3?ad val.)        1510% ad val.(with surtax, 12 $ad val.)27?% ad val.27&amp;1 ad val27?% ad val,Free (but subjectto primage dutyof 3$ ad val.). 1,000   2042,0924821,02151,000   1151,6042963643L799^2,379
Thus, the effect of the Agreement -will be that on about02 million worth of United Kingdom trade (1930 figures) thetotal Customs duties will be reduced by I2s . ad valorem, onJ30.5 million worth of United Kingdom trade, the duties willbe reduced by 9-i% ad valorem, and on the remainder of theUnited Kingdom Trade which is dutiable (some     million worthin 1930) the duties will be reduced on the average by bf. ad valorem.
                    UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.     Disregarding the temporary surtaxes which were recentlyimposed for revenue purposes,  the South African duties on united Kingdom goods are of a moderate character,  apart froma restricted number of protective duties.     No undertakings to reduce the duty on United kingdom goods were entered into by the Union, but the Union government undertook not only to maintain the existing margins ofpreference in favour of United Kingdom goods, but to affordnew or increased margins of preference to specified UnitedKingdom goods.     These increased margins of preference will affect goodsthe imports of which, on the basis of the Trade Returns forthe Year 1931, were of a total value of  5,939,000, importsof such goods from the United Kingdom amounting to  8,933,000.The principal commodities involved are cotton and artificial silk piece-goods, knitted underclothing and mining andindustrial machinery.
NEWFOUNDLAND.     This Dominion depends upon Customs duties for some 80^of her revenue, and none of her duties  in protective.Hitherto she has not adopted the principle of Imperial  Preference,Subject to the conclusion of satisfactory arrangements  for theuse of a substantial quantity of Newfoundland iron ore  in theUnited Kingdom, Newfoundland is now prepared to accord  to various classes of United Kingdom goods as from lBt July, 1933,a preference of generally 105$ ad valorem over similar foreigngoods.   The extent of this concession can be seen from thefollowing tablej-           Values of Imports into Newfoundland during                   year ended 50th June-  1951.-U-Total.Imports from    U.K..Imports of all goods..........Imports of dutiable goods .....I      1[imports of goods which will be sub ject to preference ........Thousanddollars. 25,262 16,0706,042Thousanddollars. 4,192 3,165 1,622J.     It is impossible of course to say in regard to how muchof thi3 trade the preference will be given by reducing the  duties on British goods and on how much it will take the form of increased duties on foreign goods.   Revenue considerations will no doubt determine this issue.   It is also to be noted thatthe preference now for the first time to be accorded is notto be introduced until July 1st next, i.e, from thecommencement of Newfoundland^ next financial year.
                        BRITISH INDIA.     One of the outstanding features of the Ottawa conference was the acceptance &quot;by the Government of India of theprinciple of Imperial Preference.   India is our largestmarket in the world and takes about 10$ of our total exportsto all destinations.   Hitherto except for differentialduties in her favour on certain cotton and iron and steelgoods, the United Kingdom has enjoyed no preferential advantage     The Government of India have now agreed to initiatelegislation under which a margin of preference of 10$ *dvalorem will be accorded to numerous classes of United kingdom goods subject to revenue duties, in respect of which foreign competition in India is very keen.   Examples of such goods are;-  Woollens, hardware, heavy chemicals, building and engineering materials and boots and shoes.   Motor vehicleswill be accorded a preference of     ad valorem.     The value of the imports in 1930-31 of the goods whichwill enjoy the higher rate of preference has been estimated tobet-  Imports from all sources,  28,661,000, of which fromthe United Kingdom,  12,033,000, while the value of theimports of motor vehicles in the same year were:-  Importsfrom all sources  3,682,000, of which from the United Kingdom, 828,000.     The value of the total imports of all goods into indian 1930-31 was  123,619,000 of which from the United Kingdom, 45,938,000.   It will be seen therefore that the proposedpreferences cover about 265* of India&apos;s total imports, and about 28$ of those from the United Kingdom.     India depends on Customs duties for a large proportionof her revenue.    There is no provision in the agreement regarding the manner in which the new preferences will beeffected, but it is understood to be the intention of the
Government of India, having due regard to revenueconeiuerations to give effect to their undertaking partly by reductions in the present duties on United Kingdom goods andpartly by increases in the duties on foreign goods.     The Agreement also provided, subject to arrangements being made with the United Kingdom Iron and Steel Trade, foran adjustment of the duties in favour of this country ongalvanised sheets.   These arrangements have now been concluded and the adjustments in question -will accordinglycome into force as soon as the Agreement, as a whole is approvedby the Indian legislation&amp;Latire.   The value of the imports ofgalvanised sheets into India from the United Kingdom in1930-31 was  1,381,000.     As regards other goods subject to protective duty inIndia no immediate reductions of duty or new preferences infavour of United Kingdom goods are accorded by the Agreementthough there are provisions in the Agreement relating to thefuture preferences on goods of cotton and artificial silkfollowing on enquiries by the Tariff Board.

The Agreement with Southern Rhodesia does not in factprovide for any reduction of duties from their existing  low level and as regards its immediate effect on United kingdom goods is confined to an undertaking to increase the margins of preferences in favour of a few classes of goods such as wireless telegraphy and telephony instruments and apparatus and toamend the duties on foreign cotton piece goods and silk  and artificial silk piece goods in such a way as to give increasedprotection to United Kingdom goods against increasingcompetition from the cheaper foreign lines of these goods.The relevant statistics are: -
