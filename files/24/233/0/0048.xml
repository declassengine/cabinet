IRE.         MR.  THOMAS  said  that  he had received two documents -        one  yesterday morning and  a further document this        morning  - setting  out the  views of the Irish Free State        representatives.   He suggested that  it would be a        good thing to settle  first the line of procedure which        should be adopted.    He wanted tc be  able to talk        plainly  and without prejudice.   He suggested that they        should agree that  both sides were speaking as        negotiators, each  representing their  respective        Cabinet s.            MR.  DE VALERA agreed  that the negotiations would        be without prejudice.   He aaid that  any agreement made        would be subject to approval by the Cabinet, while        any  agreement involving any payment of money would        require  to be brought before Parliament.            MR.  THOMAS  enquired whether Mr.  de Valera would        like to  elaborate  the documents which had been handed        in.URCHASE      MR.  DE VALERA indicated that as  regards Land        Annuities, his position was as appeared in his public        statements; the main points were set cut in the        memorandum.            MR.  THOMAS  suggested  that the points could be        summed up as being            (l)   the agreement was not made  by accredited                  repre sentatives.            (2)   It was not  submitted to Parliament for                  ratification.            (3)   It was provisional.            As  regards  the question of accredited representatives        he suggested that  the position in 1923 was precisely the        same as  that of  the present meeting.  Mr. Cosgrave, at the                             -1-
time, was the President of the Executive Council of theIrish Free State, elected by the people of the IrishFree State;  Mr. De Valera, he suggested, was in thesame position today.     As regards the question of ratification byParliament, he suggested that this was a matter forthe Irish Free State, it was not for the british representatives to ask how the Irish Free Staterepresentatives proposed to deal with an agreementv/hich they had made;   that was their business and notthe business of the British representatives.     MR.  DE VALERA suggested that it was not  asufficient answer to an enquiry as to his authorityfor him merely to say that he was President of theExecutive Council.   He ou lit to be able to show someCabinet document giving him authority to deal with theparticular business.     As regards the signature of an agreement, it ought to be made clear that those signing were signingas delegates, on behalf of their respective Governments.     MR.  THOMAS suggested that it would be a strangeproceeding if,  after signing a document, it were subsequently to be suggested that the signature wasnot good, because the signature was not prefacedwith certain words.     He also pointed out as regards the question ofParliamentary approval that the agreement was embodied in the Irish Free State Land Act of 1923.     MR.  DS VALERA suggested that the fact that theagreement was not signed in proper form bore out its                     -2-
                                                   Q 7 9                                                   0(0provisional character.     MR. THOMAS quoted Mr. Cosgrave&apos;s statement inthe Bail of June 1923 as follows:-       &quot;At the recent negotiations which tcck place     in England, we came to a provisional arrangement     which binds us, or in which we accept liability     for the oayment of a certain sum pending a     settlement of the major question&quot;.     MR. D3 VAL3RA said that these words would conveythat there was to he an ultimate financial settlement and that payments made in the meantime were to be without prejudice to that settlement.     MR. THOMAS replied that there was an ultimatefinancial settlement in 1926;  those words appear on the face of the document.     MR. DE VALERA suggested that - for such a matter as a final financial settlement between the two countries that document was an extraordinary document.  It waswithheld from the Irish Free State people for eight months:  it was merely a  collection of odds and ends.     MR. THOMAS enquired  whether, if an agreement wasreached  at the present meeting and a document signedwith the heading  &quot;Ultimate Financial Agreement&apos;, would the British representatives not have a justifiablegrievance if, as a result of action taken or not takensubsequently  in Ireland,  the validity  of the agreement was challenged.     MR. D?.5 VALERA referred to the resolution passedby the  Dail in 1926,  some time before  the ultimateFinancial Settlement was  signed, to the effect thatagreements with external  Governments were not binding on  the  Irish  Free State without the approval of the Dail.
     MR. THOMAS suggested that if there was any objection to the agreement it was the business of theopposition at the time to raise those objections.Moreover the a on r oval of Mr. Cosgrave&apos;s policy at aGeneral Election was an approval cf the agreement.     MR. DE VALERA replied that the recent GeneralElection still more clearly endorsed his attitude in thematter.  He added that the original agreement of 1923had never been seen by himself and his colleaguesuntil their attention was called to it by Mr. Thomas&apos;despatch in the early part of this year, and suggestedthat the British Government had connived at keeping the agreement secret,     MR. THOMAS enquired what would be the object ofthe British Government keeping the agreement secret.Was not the only possible object that they thoughtthat Mr. Cosgrave had made too good a bargain for theIrish Free State.     MR. DS VALERA suggested that it was done withthe object of assisting Mr. Cosgrave to carry out his policy in the Irish Free State.     LORD HAILSHAM said that the documents which Mr.  de valera had supplied were net quite what he had expected.&apos;At the discussions last week it was suggested that what should be considered v/as not legal technicalities,but what, in fact, reasonably ought to be dene.     On the legal points his clear view was that anagreement made between representatives, as between twocountries, is binding, and it would not be fair after-wards to take the view that such an agreement was not
 properly valid because  it  had not teen ratified-.   If ratification were  necessary it ought  to  he  stated  in the  document itself.  It would he improper  for  the British  representatives to  challenge  the position  of the Irish  Pree  State representatives  in signing an  agreement; it was for  each party to take what measures were necessary to ensure that  the agreement  was  put  into proper forma     As  regards the question  of the provisional character of the agreement, he said that  that clearly meant that the agreement was provisional until the ultimate settlement was reached.  Such a settlement was reached in 19 36.     As regards the argument  that the Land Annuities formed part  of  the Public Debt  and were, therefore? covered by  the  Boundary Agreement of 1925,  the short answer was that the obligations in question did not form part of the Public Debt.  The 1925 agreement is evidence of this since it refers only to the Treaty of 1921  and does not refer to the Agreement cf 1925.  On the general question the position seemed to him to he  that the Irish Free State Govern-ment were acting as agents for  the collection of the annuities from the tenants and their payment to  the Land Purchase Fund. Except as agents the Irish Pree State Government had no right to the money.     He felt, however, that there seemed to be no prospect of reaching  agreement on legal  points.  Mr. Be Valera had been advised in one sense by  his lawyers, his predecessors had been advised in another sense by their  lawyers; and the British representatives had been  advised by their lawyers that their position  was right, and he  (Lord Hailsham) although speaking now as a layman, could only  say  that in his personal view that advice was rights
                                                      3rv rt                                                        6 Q     MR. DE VALERA  said  that  their  whole  position was that  the Land Stock formed part of  the  Public Debt and the actual  liability for  the  payment  to  the  stock- holders had already been assumed by the British  Government under the Act of 1920, and at the time  of the Treaty v/as an actual liability  of the British Exchequer.     LORD HAILSHAM  said  what  happened in 1930 v/as not that the British Government agreed  to assume liability but that the British  Government agreed to give  to the Government to be established under  that Act, an  amount equal to the monies collected from  the tenants.  But this arrangement never came into effect since it was repealed by the Treaty arrangements.  On the general question he suggested that the Irish Free State were claiming,  as regards this  single question of the Annuities, the benefits of the 1920 Act, but as regards all othermatters they were claiming the benefit of the Treaty arrangements of 19 21.     MR.  G30GHEGAN  said  that he did not think it was necessarily impossible to reach agreement on the legal questions;  he, for his part, was quite open to conviction if he received a demonstration that he was wrong on the legal points.  His  position was that the repeal of theAct of 1920 was after the  passage of the Irish Free State Constitution Act, and therefore could not be held to take effect as&apos; far as the Irish Free State was concerned.     LORD HAILSHAM  enquired whether the claim v/as that the Act of 1920 was still  in force  as regards the Irish Free State.   If so he thought that the British Government would have a  considerable claim for monies under the Act.
       As  a matter cf  fact the two Acts, namely thePree State Constitution Act and the Act repealing theAct of 1920 came into  force on the same day.   As the lav;does not take account  of parts of days in this matter itwas not possible to say that one Act was later than theother.       MR. DE VALERA said that his point was that whenthe Treaty was signed the Act of 1920 was in operation andthe gift,  as it was called, of the Annuities to &quot;southern ireland&quot; was still operative.    Mr.  Lloyd George&apos; intention was to divide Ireland.    when the offer madeby the Act of 1920 was refused he made a further offer in1921 which went beyond the 1920 offer, hut could not beregarded as revoking what had already been given in 1920.Therefore  the obligation to meet  the various payments ofthe stock-holdersj etc., under the Lend Act rested on theUnited Kingdom as part of the Public Debt, and any obligation on the part of the Irish Pree State to  contri-bute thereto was v/iped out by the Agreement of 1925.       LORD HAILSHAM said that the intention of the Govern-ment of Ireland Act, 1920, was undoubtedly to set  up a subordinate legislature in Southern Ireland.    One of its provisions was that the proposed  Government of southern ireland should make certain payments to the United Kingdom;another provision was that the Land Purchase Annuities (theproperty of the National Debt  Commissioners)  should, fromthe coming into force of the relevant  clause, be receivedby the Southern Irish Exchequer for their general  purposes.That provision must be regarded as scrapped.    It  was quite impossible to argue that it could remain valid whileall the other Southern Irish provisions of the Act hadbeen scrapped.    Until quite recently nobody on either
side had  ever dreamed that the Land Purchase provisions ofthe 1920 Act v/ere alive.   To argue that they were alivewas bad law and bad equity.       MR. DE VALERA said that the proposed Southern Irishpayments which had been mentioned were in a different cate-gory.   They had been intended as the payments for certain services which the Government of the United Kingdom v/as to perform for Southern Ireland:  the Free State was nowperforming those services  itself and was paying for them.       LORD HAILS HAM said that it v/as distinctly provided inthe Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Acts 1922,Section l(l) that the Act of 1920 should cease to apply toany part of Ireland, except Northern Ireland.    the consequential Provisions Act had made no specific referenceto the Land Purchase Annuities.       MR. DE  VALERA said that the intention of Mr. LloydGeorge in 1921 was obviously to make all possible concessions in order to induce Southern Ireland to come to terms.    Mr.Lloyd George had certainly said nothing about taking back any concessions already made.       MR. CHAMBERLAIN was clear that it was quite impossibleto base a valid argument on hypothetical assumptions about Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s intentions of eleven years ago;  the only way of conducting a sound argument was to rely upon theterms of the actual legislation.       MR. DE  VALERA said that he had been thinking ofMr. Lloyd George&apos;s intentions on December 6th, 1921 - the dateof the signing of the Treaty.       LORD HAILSHAM said that the Acts of 1922 (namely, theIrish Free State (Agreement)  Act of March 1922, the IrishFree State Constitution Act and the Irish Free State(Consequential Provisions)  Act of December, 1922)  v/ere the                             -8-
 legislation which gave  effect to that Treaty.     MR. McENTEE argued that the Irish Free State Constitution Act and  the Irish Free  State (Consequential Provisions) Act &apos; of December 6th, 1922,  both passed on the same day, were inconsistent with each  other.     LORD HAILSHAM was  not prepared to admit the inconsistency. Speaking quite generally,  and without reference to the particular argument, the second of two Acts of Parliament prevailed over the first.     MR.  GEOGHEGAK said that the Consequential ProvisionsAct was a British measure intended purely for British consumptionThe Free State could have done without it..  The Dail had doneall that was necessary,  so far as the Free State was concerned,when it passed its Adaptation of Enactments Act.     LORD HAILSHAM enquired whether that Act included the repeal of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920.   If it did not,would Mr. Geoghegan argue  that the 1920 Act as a whole wasvalid in the Irish Free  State?     MR.  GEOGHEGAN was not prepared to answer without notice.He held strongly,  however, that when a valuable concessionhad been made, like that made to the Free State by the 1920Act,  it could not  be withdrawn save by specific words in a statute.   The mere general repeal of the 1920 Act by the parliament of the  United Kingdom was not enough.     LORD HAILSHAM said that the Treaty of December, 1921, followed from the fact that the people of Southern ireland had already rejected the Act of 1920.  It could not be supposed that the Treaty intended to leave Southern Ireland the
privileges  granted to it by the 1920 Act.  The Free State was now, in effect, claiming to say that the palatable parts ofthe 1920 Act were in force and the unpalatable parts repealed.     MR. THOMAS said that, as a layman, he regarded all these points as having been settled ten years ago.   The man in the street certainly believed that the Free State had as goodlegal advice ten years ago as it had now, and that Mr.  Cosgrave&apos;Government had been effective in extorting the maximum ofconcession from this country.     MR. DE VALERA asked whether it was not being forgotten that the whole argument concerned the division of the sssetsand liabilities of what had been,  up to 1921,  a commonExchequer.   His opinion v/as that Mr.  Cosgrave had been taken at an unfair disadvantage in 1923.   He had not at that time had the opportunity of learning what were the Free State&apos;srights.     LORD HAILSHAM pointed out that the Financial Agreementof 1923 had been confirmed by that signed in 19 25.     MR. DE VALSRA said he wished to emphasize what was thelegal position regarding the Land Annuities at the time whenthe Treaty was signed.   At that date (which was the onlyrelevant date) the 1 iability to pay the stock-holders v/aspart of the public debt of the Government of Great Britainand Ireland.  It was futile to claim that the National DebtCommissioners were in this respect a private debt collectingagency.  They were part of the Governmental machinery of theUnited Kingdom - the State (or the successor of the State)v/hich had guaranteed the payments.     MR. CHAMBERLAIN disagreed.     MR. MAGUIRE said that it was surely not contended that
                                                     9 0 4                                                     eJC* 1the 1920 Act was not in force in 1921 o     LORD HAILSHAM said that parts of the Act (those  for v/hichthere were not appointed days) were certainly then in cpera-tion; other parts were not.  It had &quot;been provided that  theywere not to come into force until certain appointed days:  andthose days had never teen fixed*     MR. McENTEE enquired how Lord Hailsham interpretedSection 73 of the 192C Act.     LORD HAILSHAM said that he was familiar with the argument which Mr. McEntee had in mind.   He feared that they would never reach agreement regarding the legality of the Order inCouncil v/hich had been made under that Section.   After all,this was a minor point.     It was the firm view of the United Kingdom Governmentthat the Free State had nots and never had, any right toretain the Land Annuities for its own use.     MR. DE  VALERA feared that they were not getting  anynearer to a greement.     MR. THOMAS wondered whether there was any possibility ofmaking progress by a direct exchange of views between thelawyers on each side.     MR. GEOGHEGAN said that he would certainly welcome a detailed legal examination, and would enter into it with amind open to conviction.     SIR THOMAS INSKIF said that he would be glad to meet mr. Geoghegan.
IT WAS AGREED:    that the meeting &quot;between the Lav/ Officers  on    either side should take place at a later stage    in the negotiations.BONUS AND EXCESS ANNUITIES.IT WAS AGREED:    that the legal arguments regarding the Bonus    and Excess  Annuities should he examined by    the Law Officers on either side at a later    stage of the negotiations.
                                                             t)OJIRISH        MR.  DE VALERA said that the arguments upon whichBULARYIS.     the Irish Free State relied were summarised in        paragraph 4 of the Memorandum.     Neither the  Treaty        nor the Agreement amending the  Treaty imposed  on the        Government of the Irish Free State any liability for        the pensions of pre-Treaty pensioners and the  allowances        to their dependents.     The Royal Irish Constabulary        did not retire in consequence of the  change of        Government, nor were they discharged  by the Irish        Government, but they were disbanded by the British        Government under a British Statute, namely the        Constabulary (Ireland)  Act 1922,      The Royal Irish        Constabulary was an Imperial Force and not an  Irish        Police Force, and accordingly it would not &quot;Vie  right  or        equitable to impose a charge for their pensions, etc.,  on        the Irish people.             MR.  THOMAS suggested that  these  particular        liabilities were similar to the  liabilities of any ether        continuing service, such, for example, as the  Post Office.             MR.  DS VALERA said that if  the British Government        had,  without the consent of the  Irish Representatives,        disbanded the postmen in Ireland tefore the Treaty,        there would have been a strong  case for maintaining  that        pension and compensation payable to the disbanded men        should be assumed by the British Government.             MR.  THOMAS agreed that this might be so, but        what had been done in regard to  the Royal Irish        Constabulary was done by agreement with the Irish        Representatives.      The whole matter had been        exhaustively argued,  and in the  end an agreement  had been        reached and payments had been made under the Agreement        for the last 10 years.
      MR.  DE VflLERA said that the Irish Free  State Government questioned the validity of the Agreements made in the  case of these Royal Irish Constabulary Pensions, just as they questioned them in  the ether cases.   Was it contended that if unauthorised persons made  an arrangement which gave away the  rights of the Irish people,  that arrangement was to he  binding on the  Irish Free  State?      MR.  THOMAS repeated that af uer very prolonged argument  an agreement  had teen reached which had been regarded  as a binding  agreement  for the last 10 years.      MR.  GEOGHEGAR maintained that  the Royal Irish Constabulary had always been regarded as an Imperial Force, and  he  quoted a statememt. made by Sir Robert Peel 70 years ago  in  which Sir Robert referred to the Constabulary as an Imperial  Force.      MR.  THOMAS enquired whether it was really relevant to bring  up quotations  of  70  years ago.   All considerations of this kind must have  &quot;been  in the  minds of those who negotiated the  agreement  made 10  years ago.      MR.  GEOGHEGAN&quot; observed  that  Mr.  De Valera had already pointed out  that  there was  evidence  that those  who negotiated on behalf of the  Irish Free State 10 years ago had  inadvertently  emitted to bring  forward certain arguments.   It had been  suggested  that the  Royal Irish Constabulary was  an  Irish Police  Force, and  he wished to bring before the Meeting  statements made by  certain eminent persons that the Force was not an Irish Police Force fcy an Imperial Force.   Mr. Geoghegan then read quotations from statements by Mr. Goschen and Sir A, McDonnell.     MR. CHAMBERLAIN enquired whether it was argued that  the agreement made in 1923 was inequitable  and shouldbe re-opened on the ground that the Royal  Irish  Constab-ulary was  an Imperial Force,
                                                   (1 n (v     MR.  GEOGHEGAN  said  that the argument was that it &apos;was  for  the  Irish Free State to decide v/hat pensions itwould pay.   The Irish Free State had never taken over theRoyal Irish  Constabulary but the British Government haddisbanded the Force under a British Statute - theConstabulary (Ireland) Act 1922.     LORD HAILSHAM  said  that when the Treaty of the6th  December 1921 was signed, it was contemplated that both the  Royal Irish Constabulary and the dublin metropolitan Police should be transferred to the Provision-al Government as part cf the general transfer of powersand  functions to the new Irish Free State.   A change ofpolicy then  supervened,  and at the instance of theProvisional  Government it was decided not to transfer theRoyal Irish  Constabulary to the new Government but to disband  it.    On the other hand, the Dublin MetropolitanPolice was transferred to the Provisional Government.These arrangements v/ere  embodied in the document &quot;Headsof Working Arrangements  for implementing the Treaty&quot;dated 24th January, 1922.   Discussions then took place with regard  to the share which the Irish Free State should bear of the  total superannuation^  etc. charges in respectof the Royal Irish Constabulary, and ultimately anagreement was reached which was embodied in the financial agreement, of February 1923.     MR.  McENTEE  said that it was important to remember that at that time the Royal Irish Constabulary stronglyobjected  to being taken  over by the Provisional Government.The Irish Free State Delegates could not over-emphasisetheir view that the Force was an Imperial Force and notmerely an Irish Police Force.     LORD HAILSHAM observed that the  Royal Irish  Constab-ulary carried cut the  ordinary police duties throughoutmost of Ireland.
      MR.  CHAMBERLAIN,  after  referring  to the provisions contained in Article 10  of the Treaty  relating to compensation, pointed  out that it had  subsequently &quot;been agreed with  the Provisional Government ,that the Royal Irish Constabulary should be disbanded and that this had been effected  by the Constabulary (Ireland)  Act, 1922.   The Irish Free  State Delegates had spoken as though that Act had been passed in opposition to the real wishes of the Irish people. There was no  doubt, however, that in 1922 both sides recognised that the Royal Irish Constabulary could not be continued,  that the Force must be disbanded as  part of the political  settlement, and that suitable provision must be made in the Act dealing with disbandment  for the superannuation and compensation liabilities  which  disbandment must entail.    Very exhaustive  discussions took place in regard to these superannuation and  compensation arrangements which eventually  led up  to the Agreement of February,  1923. With regard  to the  annual compensation allowances granted under the disbandment Act of 1922,  the Irish Free State Ministers had argued that when the Treaty liability was undertaken  they had not contemplated such  extensive superannuation as  was the necessary consequence  of the disbandment of the Force,  but in the  end they recognised the  strength of the reply that disbandment was the policy of the  Provisional Government as much as of the  British Government.    In  the end  the Irish Free. State representatives acceptedliability for 75 per cent, of the annual superannuation and compensation charges.    In these circumstances,he (Mr. Chamberlain) again enquired  whether it was
represented in this respect that the Agreement of1923, was inequitable because the Royal irish constabulary was an Imperial and not a local Force.     MR. GEOGHEGAN argued that the Agreement ofFebruary, 1923 was a provisional agreement, did not constitute a final and binding settlement, and was opento reconsideration like the other financial questions at the present time.     MR. D3 VAL3RA objected to the suggestion that the disbandment of the Royal Irish Constabulary had beencarried out at the instance of the provisional Govern-ment, and read to the meeting extracts from an Irishinter-Departmental minute of 21st December 1922, signed byby Mr. 0&apos;Higgins in support of his view.     MR. THOMAS suggested that the explanation whichhad been given by Mr. Chamberlain was the true one;both sides recognised in 1922 that the disappearancefcf the Royal Irish Constabulary was an essential preliminary to a political settlement.     MR. MAQUIRE enquired which were the bindingAgreements, the Treaty or the Agreements subsequent to the Treaty?     LORD HAILSHAM saw no inconsistency in the provisionsof the Treaty and those of the Agreements.    Afterrepeating the reasons why it had been decided to disbandthe Royal Irish Constabulary, he pointed out thatafter disbandment was effected by the United kingdom in 1922, there still  remained for settlement thequestion of how  .any  compensation was to be determined
 and who  was  to pay  it.     As the policing of the Irish Pree State was handed over to the Irish Pree State Government it was not  unnatural that the Government of the Irish Pree State should assume liability for police superannuation  and  compensation charges. After prolonged discussions it was eventually agreed that the United Kingdom Exchequer should pay the pensions and compensation in the case cf the Royal Irish Constabu- lary, and that the  Irish Pree State Government should make a contribution to this expenditure.     He could not see  any inconsistency, as &quot;between the Treaty and the Agreements, in  the arrangements which had been made.     MR. DE VALERA  observed that he was net sure that he  could agree that no use could have been madeby the Irish Pree State Government of the personnel of the Royal Irish Constabulary, and MR.  GEOGHEGAN mentioned that many ex-members of the Force were actually now in the service of the Irish Free State as Civic Guards.     MR. McENTEE   thought that the position v/as that the Provisional Government did not want the Royal Irish Constabulary to be transferred, and the Constabulary could not be taken for service outsideIreland.,      The United Kingdom, therefore, had an Imperial force in Ireland which it could not use, and the problem of the disposal of that Force was essentially a United Kingdom problems     Even if theProvisional Government had been willing to take
over the Force in 1922, the personnel would undoubtedly have declined to be transferred.     LORD HAILSHAM observed that  this sounded to him as if the Constabulary fell under Article 10 of theTreaty as persons &quot;who retired in consequence ofthe change of Government effected in pursuancehereof%     MR.  DE VALERA said that the  Treaty was a document which had been thoroughly discussedthroughout the Irish Free State and the provisionsof which could, in his view, only be varied bya document equally authoritative  and the contents of which had been equally brought to the notice of Irish public opinion.     The Irish Free StateDelegates claimed that the Royal  Irish Constabularywas an Imperial force and on grounds cf equitythey maintained that the United Kingdom shoulddischarge all the superannuation and compensationliabilities.     MR.  THOMAS said that the United Kingdom Delegatesequally maintained that on grounds of equity thearrangements come to in 1923 should not be varied.All the considerations which had been advanced onthe present occasion had been the subject of discussionwhen the Agreement was made.     MR.JXT VALERA said that it appeared to him thatthis was another case in which neither side was going to convince the other.     He wished to add thatin no conceivable circumstances could the Irish FreeState agree to accept liability for the pensions of
ex-members of the Royal Irish Constabulary who retiredin the ordinary course prior to disbandment and werepensioned under previous Constabulary (Ireland)  Acts.     LORD HAILSHAM urged, v/ith regard to this last point, that these pensioners v/ere in exactly thesame position as ex-postmen and other pre-Treatypensioners,     MR,  THOMAS pointed outtthat under the Treaty theIrish Free Sta^e Government took over the assets and liabilities of the transferred services as agoing concern.     He noticed that there was never any reference made by the Irish Free State Delegates tothe assets which thay had  acquired under these arrangements,     MR.  DS VAL3RA said that this raised the questionof the share of the Irish Free State in the colonies and Imperial equipment,     MR.  THOMAS said that this point arose underthe second Irish Free State memorandum.      The UnitedKingdom Delegates were bound to bear in mind the assets side of the balance-sheet.
 AMD       MR. THOMAS inquired whether Mr. De Valera wished total      acid anything on the next item, that relating to judges&apos; and      civil pensions.          MR. DE VALERA said that the argument was set forth      briefly  in the Memorandum.  As regards judges who retired      before the Treaty no liability was imposed on the Irish      Pree State under the Treaty and it was not seen how      liability could accrue.   In so far as there was any      liability on the Irish Eree State under Article 10 of the      Treaty,  discharge of that liability should he made by a      direct payment and not indirectly.          LORD HAILSHAM referred to Article 80 of the Irish Pree      State Constitution which expressly provided that as respects      &quot;Departmental property, assets, rights, and liabilities, the      Government of the Irish Free State shall be regarded as the      successors of the Provisional Government....&quot;  He thought      that judges&apos; and other pensions were clearly a departmental      liability within the meaning of that Article and that the      Irish Free State had thereby accepted responsibility for      them.          MR. -McENTEE suggested that Article 80 was in conflict      with the Treaty and was therefore void and inoperative to      the extent of its repugnancy to the Treaty.   There was      nothing  in the Treaty which imposed liability for pensions      prior to the time of the Treaty.          LORD HAILSHAM replied that there is nothing  in the      Treaty to prohibit the acceptance of such liabilities.          MR. GEOGHEGAN suggested that a distinction should be      drawn between the pension of a judge and of a civil servant,
and that it was not proper to regard a judge&apos;s pension asa departmental liability.     MR.  McENTEE added that judges were not members of adepartmentj  their pensions formed a general charge on the consolidated Fund.     LCRD HAILSHAM suggested that it was possible to interpret&quot;departmental&quot; in a special sense under which it would bepossible to say that there was no such thing as departmentalproperty,&apos; assets, and rights as well,   Strictly speaking,all assets, etc. belonged to the State for the department concerned, and nyt to the Department as such.     MR. GEOGHSGAN maintained that there was a distinctionas the pensions of judges were charged on the consolidate fund and not on annual votes.   He suggested further that,in sy far as they were charged on the Consolidated Fund,  itmight be held that they formed part of the public debt andso were released by the Agreement of 1925.     MR. THOMAS said that we ought to look at the circum-stances at the time.   The question, no doubt, then discussedwas whether it was proper that the Irish Free State shouldbe responsible for the payment of pensions of former servants,the reply to which was that if they took over the buildingsthey ought to take over the liability for the pensions also.     MR. DE VALERA said that, in so far as the United Kingdomcase v/as founded on agreements, it was founded on agreementsv/hich he could not accept.   The only argument which had  beenbrought forward this morning on the legal points which had appeared to him as a new argument was that with relation  to article 80 of the Constitution, and on that, he gathered,that his legal advisers were not prepared to accept the view
of the British representatives.   All the other argumentsused had already even previous to the Conference beenbrought forward and met, so far as he was concerned.     MR. THOMAS inquired whether there was any further argument to be brought forward in regard to the other two matters remaining in the Memorandum, namely, Local LoansAnnuities and the various Works Annuities.   The UnitedKingdom point of view was that in neither case would  thesebe regarded as part of the public debt.     MR. CHAMBERLAIN explained the view to be, as regardsthe Local Loans Fund, that there was only a contingent liability on the Exchequer;  the loans were made from theFund and the interest on the stock was met out of payments made into the Fund.   In the circumstances, he did net thinkthat it could properly be regarded as public debt.     MR. DE VALERA said that, in his view, public debt inArticle 5 of the Treaty was used to cover State indebtednessin the widest sense and would include such items as local loans Stock which is a State obligation.     MR. THOMAS inquired whether the same argument was employed in regard to the Military Works etc. Annuities.     MR. DE VALERA replied that the position was that theIrish Free State representatives did not accept theagreements on which the claim was based.    The payments were regarded as public debt payments and so wiped outby the Agreement of 1925,
     MR. THOMAS said that each particular item had  been dealt with but that there had been no discussion yet  of  the broad general issue of financial relations.     the subjects under discussion had been the items which  arethe immediate cause of the difference between theUnited Kingdom and the Irish Free State and  the position which had been reached could be summed up as follows:-     The United Kingdom representatives had  been toldnothing either in documents or orally which  wouldalter their view of the equity and justice of their case.   He understood from Mr. De Valera that theIrish Free State representatives took the same view as regards their case.     He mentioned that he and his colleagues had onlyseen, at the beginning of the meeting, the furtherdocument which had been handed in on the previous night, and asked what course it was suggested should now be followed.4-
        MR. DE VALERA said that it was only now thatthe two Governments were really negotiating the ultimatefinancial  settlement contemplated in the Treaty.   Ifthere was  to he such a settlement as would obviatefurther meetings like the present, account would haveto be taken of all the items mentioned in the secondFree State Memorandum.   That was merely a preliminaryMemorandum indicating the heads of the various claims.Some of them had already been the subject of corres-pondence between the two Governments in the past.        In reply to MR. THOMAS who referred to the fifth head of the Memorandum (Currency), and enquire whether it was not for the convenience of the IrishFree State that British currency notes v/ere circulatedthere*        MR0 McENTEE said that while neither Governmenthad put forward a definite request for such an arrange-ment it was clear that as a matter of equity the IrishFree State should have a share of the profits derivedfrom the circulation of the British notes.        LORD HAILSHAM pointed out that none of theIrish Free State claims gave any figures of the amountclaimed, to which        MR. BE VALERA replied that they could go intothe figures if necessary, although some of them would be rather troublesome to determine,,        MR. THOMAS said that nevertheless it would be convenient if, for example,  the Irish Free StateGovernment could indicate what sort of compensationthey had in mind under Head 2 (Abandonment of the GoldStandard).
                                                3o n        MR. McENTEE said that Irish people haddeposited in their Banks sums amounting to  75millions which the Banks had invested in BritishGovernment securities,   As Great Britain did notconsult the Irish Pree State before abandoning thegold standard he thought some compensation was dueto  the holders of these securities and that theywere entitled to he paid in sterling of the samegold value as when the money was first invested.        LORD HAILS HAM asked v/hy the Irish PreeState should expect such compensation when noother country had received it, to which        MR. DE VALERA replied that if othercountries had an opportunity of making such a financial settlement as was now being discussedthey would no doubt put in a claim to compensation.He asked whether if the Irish Pree State hadsimilarly abandoned their currency standard with asimilar loss to British nationals no protest wouldhave been made by Great Britain against such action.Had Britain not made such a protest to Prance?       The Meeting then adjourned until 3 p.m.itehall Gardens, S.W.I.14tb  October,  1932.

9 G o        MR. THOMAS said tiiat Sir Thomas Inskip had apoint to raise arising out of the discussions at the morning meeting,        SIR THOMAS INSKIP said that he understood theposition to te that they were dealing without prejudicewith a number cf claims put forward by the Irish FreeState representatives.   He had one question to askwhich was - if the 1926 Agreement is binding, are notthese claims thereby  concluded?        MR. GEOGHEGAN could not say that every littlematter of detail would be settled by the acceptance ofthe 1926 Agreement as binding; but generally speakinga vast difference would be made.        SIR THOMAS INSKIP suggested that there were only two ways by which this point could be settled,either by two reasonable people (say Mr. Geoghegan and himself) meeting to try to persuade one another, or bya third person as umpire.   He understood that theground relied upon to show7 that the Agreement was notbinding was that it was suppressed and not brought tothe knowledge of the bail.        The question which he wished to ask was - whatrule of law, was to be regarded as applicable in con-sidering the matter?   Was it the rule of internationallaw, or v/as it the ordinary municipal law of contract?This was a question which would have to be answeredwhether the settlement v/as to be by discussion or by arbitration, whether by a foreign arbitrator or otherwise.        MR.  IE VALERA said that for his part he would try to get behind law and appeal to fair play and natural justice.- 1 -
        MR. GEOGHEGAN said that he thought it couldclearly he un.aerst.ooi. that he cculi net give a definite answer te which he would re committed in all respects.Speaking offhand, he thought that to some extent the municipal law of the Irish Free State would have to &quot;reconsidered - for example the Article of the constitution as to the formalities required to ho fulfilled beforemoney leaves the Exchequer.   There might also be points of international law.   There might also be a quest i-jnof a fundamental mistake which would render the Agree-ment void cr at any rate voidable.   Assuming that thearguments which the Irish Free State representatives had put forward in the morning wore sound and that theIrish Fcee State negotiators of 19S3, 1925 and 1926had n^t adverted to those points there might be such a fundamental mistake as would amount to more than a mistake of law, and would render the whole Agreementinvalid.        SIR THOMAS INSKIP suggested that it would notbe possible to say that the Agreement was void merely because of certain rules made by municipal law.        MR. GE0G..IEGAN referred to Article 61 of theConstitution and observed that this was not Irish FreeState Law only; it was an Imperial Act, and must,therefore, be taken into consideration.   He explainedthat he could not attempt to give an exhaustive answer to Sir Thomas Inskip&apos;s questions without furthercons i dera t ion.        SIR TK0M4S INSKIP said that his object was onlyto suggest a point which would require furtherconsideration.
                    LORD HAILSHAM pointed out that the reference            to a fundamental mistake arid to principles of equity            again raised the question what system of lav.- would he            applied, as in different systems of law different            rules existed with regard to the effect of error, and            also different rules of equity...LAIM                ME. THOMAS said that in turning to the.;CT ORvTTON        consideration of Mr.  de Valera&apos;s second document, he OR            would like to say that apart from, the fact that the            United Kingdom representatives had not had full time            to examine --he document, it did not appear to him that            it contained any specific claims.   He gathered that            it was intended to convey that the Irish Free State            representatives believed that under the respective            Heads there was some money due to the Irish Free State.            He gathered that in their view this was not separate            from the general question of the financial relationship            between the two countries.                    MR. IE VALERA said that what he had had in            mind was something analogous to a dissolution of            partnership.    The assets and liabilities of the former            United Kingdom ought to be fairly divided.   Under the            first Head his claim v/as for over-taxation and also for            a share of the assets.   As regards the latter, a            claim could be drawn up, but it could not be done in a            very short time.                    As regards over-taxation a number of Commissions            had reported and estimates had teen made which reached            amounts inclusive of interest almost of &quot;astronomical&quot;            size.- o -
The actual amount without interest of the claim whichhe had in mind was  400,000,000.   The claim was onthe basis of over-taxation in violation of the Act of union from the years 1801-1921.   The basis of theclaim was on the Reports of the Chillers Commission andthe Primrose Commission.    The figure given by theOhileers Commission was two and three-quarter millionpounds for the year 1693-4 (adjusted by Mr. Chillerstwo two and one-quarter millions).   He pointed outthat the claim on this Head would far outweigh any claim based on the value of land handed over to tenantsin the Irish Pree State.        MR. THOMAS asked whether this issue was inthe minds of those who agreed to the Treaty.        MR. IE VALERA replied that it was so clearly in their minds that definite provision was made forsuch a counter-claim by Article 5 of the Treaty.        In reply to a further question by Mr.  Thomasabout the Agreement of 1925, Mr. de Valera observedthat the financial settlement then made had relationto the boundary, and was on the footing that an ultimate financial settlement was still to follow.    Thiwas the point which he suggested should be dealt  within any financial settlement now reached.
       MR * DE VALERA said that this natterhad teen discussed at the Meeting that morning, and he  agreed that the questiondid not arise under the Treaty.       MR, THOMAS said that it was notadmitted that there had been  any loss to theFree State, and  even if there had been a lossthe United Kingdom could not  admit that any claim  could be justified.   The Gold StandardAct was domestic legislation which theUnited Kingdom was entitled te amend asfound  necessary.       MR. McENTEE said that  the Governmentof the Irish Pree State claimed to he entitledto a share in the assets of the Road fund of the United Kingdom,,       MR. CHAMBERLAIIT observed that thiswas a  question which was the  subject ofdiscussion between the two government Therewas a  dispute as to the method of apportion-ment and he understood that the Irish PreeState  had agreed to refer the point to,arbitration0   was it new suggested that thematter should be dealt with otherwise thanby recourse to arbitration?       MR. DE VALERA said that the IrishPree State Government had included all the outstanding items in the Memorandum.
                 They would he quite prepared to consider bringing                 this particular  item into a comprehensive                 settlement.I0IHAGB.                  MR. DS VALERA said that the Irish Free                 State  claimed that the British Government should                 redeem all their Token Coinage rendered redundant                 in  the Irish Free State &quot;by the issue of the                 national  coinage there0                        MR. CHAMBERLAIN pointed out that this                 matter had been  settled, by an agreement between                 the Irish Free State and. the British Government                 by  which  the latter Government had agreed, as a                 generous  and ex  grabia concession, to redeem                 United Kingdom silver at the rate of  50,000 a                 year over a period of 10 years,                        MR. DE VALERA said that there was a sense                 of  grievance in  the Irish Free State with                 reference to this particular agreementc                        MR. CHAMBERLAIN asked how the United Kingdom                 Government could satisfy themselves that if a new                 agreement was made now on the subject, some future                 Government in the Irish Free State would not come                 forward with the plea that there was a sense of                 grievance with regard to any new terms which might                 now be agreed.                        MR. DE VALERA urged that agreements could                 always be varied by the parties to them if they                 were found to be unsatisfactoryo   If  a new                 agreement was now reached,- the United Kingdom
              would  have  the  important  safeguard  that that              agreement would, have &quot;been ratified  by  the Parliament              of the Irish Free  State,  and possibly  also by the              Irish  people themselves.                     MR;.  McENTEE explained that from the Irish              point  of view the  existing  agreement was a very              unsatisfactory one,  and in  reply to a  question by              LORD HAILSKAM he stated that the present claim was              not merely  for monies  under the Coinage Agreement,              but for something  more.   It was desired to re-open              the Coinage Agreement  itself.ENCY.                 MR.  McENTEE said that this claim was for the              full amount of the profits  derived  by  the British              Government  between the 1st  April, 1922 and the 9th&quot;              September,  1928 inclusive from the  circulation &quot;of              British Treasury Notes in the Irish Pree State and              from the Treasury  Notes or  Certificates required              to be  held  by the  Irish Banks to cover their note              circulation appertaining to the area of the Irish              Pree State.                     ICR.  THOMAS  suggested that the British Treasury              Notes  had been issued  because the Irish Pree State              were unable to make their own issue, and that the              arrangement had been a most convenient and economical              one for the Irish  Pree State.  He doubted whether              anything would have been heard of the  matter if there              had been a  loss on the circulation  of  the notes.                     MR.  McENTEE urged that the arrangement had been              mutually advantageous  and convenient,  both to the              United Kingdom and the Irish Pre &apos; State and that              some share  of the  profits ought in  equity to be              paid over to the latter.
                   MR.  CHAMBERLAIN pointed cut that the claim            was for the whole amount of the profits.                   LORD HAILSHAM said that there were two            separate claims, and asked with regard to the second            claim what  was the authority w hich since the Treaty            had required the Irish Banks to ccver their note            circulation in the Irish Free State &quot;by Treasury Notes            and Certificates.                   MR.  McLNTLE said that the authority in question            was statutory.   The Irish Free State Delegates asked            that during the very difficult transitional period            when this special and mutually advantageous arrange-            mwht was made the profits of the note issue should            he divided, adding that he meant &quot;by this that the Irish            Free State  should be entitled to the profits on the            notes which circulated in Ireland.                   MR.  THOMAS observed that in this matter the            Irish Free  State were claiming a financial benefit            in respect  of a transaction for which it took no            responsibility whatever.                   MR.  DE VALERA thought that Mr. McEntee&apos;s            point about the transitional period was a strong one,            and urged that a fair share of the profits *f the            hcte issue  should be given to the Irish Free State.&quot;AL TEACHERS,       ME.  THOMAS enquired whether this particular$ FUND[?.          matter had  been raised during the discussions 10 years            ago.                   MR.  McENTEE did not think that there had been            any discussion, and he could recollect no agreement            an the point,                                      -8-                   V.
       MR.  TRCMA.S pointed cut that the assets cf the pension Fund v/ere divided between the Irish FreeState and Northern Ireland in 1922, and on thetransfer cf the pension Fund the Irish Free Statetook over,  net enly the assets in question, but thecorresponding liabilities, namely payments of futurepensions to teachers.       MR.  McELLIGCTT said that there was an actualdeficit on the Fund when it was handed over in 1922.That deficit was, in the main, due to the great increase in Teachers&apos; salaries which had taken placesome years earlier and to the failure of theTreasury to increase their own or the teachers&apos;contributions to the Fund.       MR.  CHAMBERLAIN remarked that this claimappeared to be somewhat different from the etherclaims.   The Irish Free State Delegates represented that when the Pension Fund v/as transferred in 1922,the amount of the deficit was not appreciated andthat there was a moral claim on the United kingdom to rectify the matter.       MR.  McENTEE agreed, and urged that the claim was greatl.y strengthened by the fact that the deficit was mainly due to action taken by theUnited Kingdom prior to the change of Government.       MR.  CHAMBERLAIN repeated that this seemed toto a moral and not a legal claim.
7.    OTHH&apos; CLAIMS AI;D IT3-I3.     (a)  National Health Insurance (v.&apos;omen&apos;s Equalisation)          Fund.     This item v/as not discussed.     (b)  Receipts under Articles 296 and 297 of the Treaty          of Versailles, and the corresponding Articles of          the Treaty of St. Germain.     MR.  MdJlITEE said that the Free  state  s claim underthis head v/as definitely related to specific Irish personsresiding in the Irish Free State,  and was on account of pre-war debts due on balance to Free State Nationals fromNationals of Germany and the other ex-enemy countries.    the rev/as also the Free State&apos;s claim to a  share in the profits madeby the Enemy Debts Clearing Office.     The total Free State claim under this head was betweenseven and eight thousand pounds.     (c)  Quit Rents.     MR.  McENTEE explained that this claim related to crown lands and other sources of Crown revenue.   The United KingdomGovernment had, since 1696 been in process of realising these assets and reinvesting  the capital.   The proceeds had, inpractice, almost all been reinvested in London.   The Irishcontention v/as that  the proceeds in respect of Irish lands  etc.should have been reinvested in Ireland;  and that, whereverreinvested, they should have been  earmarked as the property ofthe Crown  of Ireland and handed over to the Free State at thetime of the Treaty.     From  1923 onwards  the Free State had been collecting QuitRents for  its ov/n Exchequer.     The ;&apos;ree State  claim which, as explained above, dated from1896 and which amounted to some  760,CCO, had net yet beenforwarded  to the British Treasury.  Its investigation had involvedconsiderable research which had only just been completed,
     (d)  Dead Kctes.     MR.  McaETEE explained that this claim related to  the  noteissues of the various  Irish Joint-Stoclc Banks.    The dead noteswere those which, when the Free State introduced their  owncurrency notes in 1928, had teen outstanding for so longthat they might he regarded as lost.    The proper course was for the hanks to write off the notes and to bay their value tothe two Governments.    The Pree State&apos;s notion  was that some8Q*5 of the amount recovered should come to them and the remaining2Cfo to the United Kingdom Exchequer.     The matter had been under discussion between the FreeState Ministry cf Finance and the British Treasury for  someyears, and proposals had been provisionally agreed which involved the writing  off of the dead notes in three stages:  atthe first stage the two Treasuries might hope,  between  them, to recover some  400,000.     (e)  The Irish Free State&apos;s share of the assets of the Post          Office Savings Bank held against dormant accounts          located in  the Irish Pree State.     MR.  McEIITES said that the Pree State share of these assetsamounted to some  19,000,  and there had been correspondence onthe matter with the British Treasury.     MR. VALEY said that the correspondence had taken placeeight years ago.     SIR THOMAS IKSKI? pointed out that, in any case, it wouldnot be right to transfer these assets to the Free State withouta guarantee from that  Government that they would reimburse  thedormant claimants if they came to life.     MR. McELLIGOTT agreed that the British Treasury had refusedto transfer any part  of the balances without the consent of thedepositors or their legal representatives.                            -11-
     (f)  Proposals for the settlement of future  Lstate  Duty-          Cases on the basis of domicile instead  of by way          of double taxation relief.     MR.  McENTEE said that these were proposals  for a revisionof the arrangements regarding double taxation which hud  beenin force between the United Kingdom and the Free  State since1926.   The Free State estimate was that they were losingfrom  250,000 to  300,000 a year through the operation of thisarrangement, and they wished for a more equitable settlement.His predecessor had -written to Lord Sncwden when  he wasChancellor of the Exchequer, asking his consent to this  verytechnical problem being examined afresh by the Revenue officials on both sides.   Lord Sncwden had expressed sympathy, but haddeferred the re-examination.     MR. CHAMBERLAIN  said that, with his authority, the  Board of inland Revenue had written to the Revenue Commissioners in dublin this year suggesting a discussion.   The RevenueCommissioners had said they would consider the matter andcommunicate further with Somerset House.   Nothing more had happened.   It could  not be said, therefore, that we were to blame for  the delay.     MR.   M CENT EE said that he  did not  suggest this.FIR OR RIAL  CLAIMS III CRM MM Ah.     MR. THOMAS  enquired whether the  items which  had beendiscussed  that morning and that afternoon broadly represented the  factors which in  the Free  State&apos;s view must be  taken  intoaccount  in the negotiations.     MR. DE VALERA  said  that they were a rough indication  ofthe  points which would have to  be considered  if there was  tobe a comprehensive  financial  settlement.  Over and above  these
detailed points,  however,  he wished to call  attention  to  the strong sense of grievance  which existed in Ireland,  where itwas universally thought that they had not  received fairtreatment.     The United Kingdom Government  should remember  thatthese sums  were much more  to Ireland than  to them.   A millionrounds in the Free State Budget was equivalent  to 66 millionpounds in the United Kingdom budget.     MR. THOMAS enquired whether Mr. de valera&apos;s attitude was based on (a) the  ground that the Treaty did not  sufficientlytake into consideration the general financial factors  which had been mentioned,  or - (b) that the economic position of the  FreeState was now such that reconsideration was necessary.     ME. DE VALERA said that he would certainly  base his  claim on both arguments as regards financial agreements made since  theTreaty of 1921.   There v/as no doubt in his mind that  thefinancial burden imposed upon the Free State was greater  now than at the time  of making these agreements, and if xhe matter were taken to arbitration  and the case went against the FreeState they would be now quite unable to pay without economicruin.     In general the post-Treaty arrangements had worked  outinequitably for the Free State.   These later agreements  on  whichthe United Kingdom case rested had been made in such a way thatin his view they were neither morally nor  legally binding.That part of Article 5 of  the&apos; Treaty, which gave the Free Statepower to make financial counter claims, had been completelyignored.     ME. MAGUIR3 said that the Free State&apos;s right to makecounter-claims was implied in Article 10 of the financial settlement of 1926.     MR. D3 VALERA, referring to Article 5 of the Treaty, saidthat he was informed that  a  set-off was,  in law, a different matter from a counter-claim.                          -13-                           _
                                                      m     LORD HAILSHAM  agreed.     MR. GECGIISGAN  v/ished  to go further into  the  question of  the  exact meaning  of  Article 5  of  the  Treaty.4&quot;    In his view the words  &quot;having  regard  to  any  just claims  on the part of Ireland by way  of  set-off or  ocurter-claim:::11 by  no moans ruled out  the possibility cf the total  of the  Irish counter-claims being  greatly in excess of  the British claim.     LORD HAILSHAM  said  that he saw nc reference  in  the Article to any British claim.   What  was  referred  to  was the proportion of the public debt  of  the United Kingdom for which the Free  State were  to assume liability  -  an entirely different  matter.   It was ridiculous to  suggest that the authors of the Article had it in  mind that  this could be exceeded by  the Irish counter-claim,  or  that there could be any  question of Great  Britain&apos;s having to make an excess payment in cash.     MR. GSGGHEGM  said  that this  could not have been so, unless the figures  of the over-taxation of Ireland as worked out by the Childers Commission had  been forgotten.     LORD HAILSHAM  said  that he was quite  clear that  thepurpose of the Article was  the ascertainment  of what  Ireland was to pay.   It was  fundamental in the Article that  there could Lse no question  of  Ireland&apos;s  receiving money  under it.     MR. GEOGHEGAN  again called attention  to  Article  1C of the Agreement of 1926, which, in his view,  by reducing the amount of the Irish  counter-claims, definitely recognised their exia acquiescence.Article 5.  &quot;The  Irish Free State snail assume  liability for the service of the  public Debt cf  the United Kingdom  as existing at the date hereof and towards the payment cf warpensions as existing at that date  in  such  proportion  as maybe fair and equitable, having  regard  to any just claims on the part sf Ireland by way of  set-off or counter-claim,  the amount of such sums being determined  in default cf agree-ment by the arbitration of one or more independent personsbeing citizens of the British Empire.                        -14.
                                                       m     LORD HAILS HAM drev/ the opposite inference fr^m theArticle which dealt with the assets cf the consolidate fund rf the United Kingdom and said that Ireland was tomake no claims in respect of them.     MR. GEQGHEGAN asked, if it was necessary; tc go toParliament in 1925 to ratify the agreement to waive theFree State liability for the public debt, why it was netalso necessary to get the ratification of Parliament toHead Na. 10 of the Ultimate Financial Settlement.     LORD HAIL SHAM replied that the tws matters were not onthe same footing since it was obviously necessary  that parliament should be given an opportunity of expressing itsviews on a matter cf a territorial boundary with all thecontroversial questions which that involved.     MR. CHAMBERLAIN observed that it had likewise not boonregarded as necessary to go to Parliament in connection withthe waiver under Head No. 6 of any claim to payment forBritish Government property handed ever to the Pree StateGovernment.     MR.  McENTEE said that Head No. 10 dealt with a set-offwithin the meaning of Article 5 of the Treaty.   If it wasnecessary to deal, in the Ultimate Financial Settlement, withsuch a set-off, why was it not necessary to deal also with a counter-claim?   Under Article 5, the Irish Free State had two rights, a set-off and a counter-claim, and these rightswore left to them even though, the Treaty relieved them oftheir debt liability.     SIR THOMAS IN SKIP thought that the claim to assets dealtwith In head No,  1C might equally well be regarded as a counter-claim rather than a set-off.    Personally, he did
not think that the drafters of the Treaty were thinking of two separate categories in 1921.     MR.  McSNTSS thought that a counter-claim wouldrelate, for example, to over-taxation, whereas a set-offwould &quot;be of the nature oi&apos; a share in certain assets.     MR. GEOGHEGAN asked whether some significance did notattach to the fact that the 1925 Agreement v/as signed byLords Firkenhead and Prentford.   Surely such men were fullyalive to the importance of cancelling the Free State counter-claim if such had been intended by the Agreement, to which     LORD KAILSHAa replied that, according to the constructionof Article 5 which he had already described, there v/as no need for any special provision regarding counter-claims inthe boundary Agreement.   At the same time he could under-stand that Ministers in 1926 felt that, in the UltimateFinancial Settlement, it should be made doubly sure that allcounter-claims were regarded as having teen waived,     ITRc GEOGHEGAN asked whether Lord Hail sham would agreethat his (Lord Hail sham&apos;s) suggestion was that Head No, 10had been introduced into the Ultimate Financial Settlementsimply for greater caution, and     LORD JIAILSKAM replied that he did so agree.     MR. THOMAS said That the Irish Free State Delegationwould obviously not expect a full answer that afternoon tothe second document which had only just been received.  Suchcomments as the Fritish Delegates had made had been ratherin the form of inquiries.   They would give a consideredanswer to the document the next morning, although thoy couldnot of course undertake that such an answer would be acceptable                        16p
  to  the  Irish Free  State Delegation.       Both sides,  approaching the question in all sincerity and  honesty5 might  draw different conclusions from the same sets of  facts.   It was difficult for either of them to make  up  their minds that their legal advisers were wrong; hut,  even wiien political aspects were considered, the British Delegates found themselves unable to accept the contentions of the Irish Free State on various points.    They would argue indeed that not only had the Irish Free  State  got off very well under the Treaty Settlement, hut  that somethingmight he regarded as still due to the British  Government.Their views would, however, he fully made known the  next day.       After some discussion,  it  was agreed -          That  the Conference  should meet again at 11,0 a. m. ,    on Saturday morning, the 15th October,  and that  the    British Government would send a written reply to the    first Memorandum of the Irish Free State Government as    early as possible before the  time of the meeting.          The British Delegates  would also  make oral state-    ments at the meeting,  in reply to the second Free State    Memorandum.       It was also  agreed  -          That  a communique in the following terms should be    issued to the Fress by  the British Government, and that    the Free State Delegation  should, if they  thought fit,    issue a communique in  similar terms  with any  slight    changes in  phraseology  that might be necessary:-         &quot;The negotiations  with the  Irish Free  State Belega-    tion  v/ere begun,  at 2, Whitehall  Gardens, S.W-1. ,  at    10.30 a.m.,  this morning and  continued  this afternoon    at 5  p.m.    The  Irish Free State  Delegation was  composed    of: -   The President of the Executive Council  and Minister for   External Affairs,  Mr. de Valera;   Minister  of Finance,   Mr. Sean McEntee;   Minister  of Justice, Mr&apos;.

     MR.THOMAS said that it 7/as agreed yesterday that theUnited Kingdom representatives would give some reply to thepoints raised in Mr. de Valera&apos;s second document, and if thatwas agreed he would ask Mr.Chamberlain to give the reply,     MR.. CHAMBERLAIN said that he had one general observationto make.  The claims might be divided into two categories.Some had as their basis the view that certain agreements werenot valid.    That the United Kingdom representatives disputedOther claims were not founded on the alleged invalidity of anagreement, but were purely addressed to Questions of fairnessand generosity.   He only wish to say that the atmospherein which the latter claims had to bo considered could not beregarded as improved by the attitude.taken up over the formercategory of claims.     The first item in the claim was a counter-claim underArticle 5 of the Treaty.   This he understood was based onalleged over-taxation of Ireland since the Act of Uniontogether with some claim to a share in the former assets ofthe United Kingdom.     His first point was on the legal basis.   Article 5imposed a liability on the Irish Free State which was a netliability.-    The Article provided that the Irish Free state should assume liability for the service of the Public debt of the United Kingdom  1 in such proportion as may be fair and equitable, having regard to any just claims on the part OfIreland by way of set-off or counterclaims 1.   By Article Zof the Agreement of 1925  &apos;the Irish Free state is herebyreleased from the obligation under Article 5 of the saidArticles of Agreement to assume the liability therein mentioned&apos;.
     He understood that the Irish Free state Government  argued that Article 2 of the 1925 Agreement did not debex them frompresenting a counter-claim under Article 5 of the Treaty.  Inthe view of the United Kingdom however, the plain meaning ofArticle 5 of the Treaty is that a counter-claim on the part ofIreland would be taken into account in determining the liability of the Irish Free State for the service of the Public Debt of theUnited Kingdom and for that purpose only.  This liability hadbeen entirely waived and the question of any set off or counter-claim against this liability no longer arose.     It was also in the view of the United Kingdom Governmentquite clear that the purpose of Article 5 of the Treaty was toascertain what Ireland should pap, there could be no question ofIreland receiving money under it.  It followed that there wasno necessity to include provisions regarding counter claims inthe 1935 agreement but when the ultimate financial settlement was effected in 1926 it was naturally thought desirable to confinthe position namely that all counter-claims were regarded as having been waived.     If, as the United Kingdom representatives maintained, theAgreement of 1526 was valid and binding no claim could now beput forward for anything arising prior to 1926.     But apart from this legal issue, there were some observationto be made on the merits of the claim as put forward.  he understood that the claim v/as for  400pOC,000 (or  399,000,000to put it more accurately) on the head of alleged over-taxationnot including interest.   Pie wondered whether any information could be supplied as to how this claim was made up.
     Mi&quot;:. G20GEEGAK showed to Mr. Chamber lain a short noteindicating the -various totals on which the figure was based.     MR. CKAMBERLAIR inquired how this figure had beenreached.     MR. GEOGI-IEG.41^&quot; said that while in the part of theChillers Report for which Mr.Chillers himself was responsibleonly two years had been taken, other Members of the commission had worked out the details for other years.  Some of theestimates made by Members of that Commission h.d reached the total of  270,000,000.     MR - CHil-iEERLAIR suggested that the only figure whichcarried any weight as given by the Commission was Mr.Chillers&apos; own figure of two and one-quarter millions forthe year 1893-4.     Re asked whether it was claimed that these figures were based on any full and accurate information or were they only estimates.     MR. GSOGECSGAH said that it was clearly impossibleto give a really accurate figure without taking intc account every item of expenditure for every year,which would by an overwhelming task.     MR. OHAMBERLAIN said that in contradiction of the view put forward in Mr.Ceoghegan1s note, the opinion
of  the United. Kingdom representatives was  that forthe years 1801  - 1805 Ireland was under-taxed.It was for a large part  of  that time exempt from income Tax, while Income Tax was charged in england the excise duty on spirits  was less than half theEnglish rate- until 1823, and was reduced to&apos; an extremely low level in that year.     While he understood that at present  interest was not beingtahen into account, he would, if any question ofinterest arose have to point out that the  interest on the under-taxation prior to 1853 would  have a relatively much greater weight than any supposedover-taxation subsequently.     As regards the period  after 1853, the UnitedKingdom representatives  did not admit that ireland was over-taxed, and a careful examination  hadbeen made a few years ago as to the basis  of Mr.Chillers&apos; calculation.       It was thought that anumber of factors which had entered into hiscalculation  were  palpably4.
fallacious.       In the first place it assumed&apos;that:-    (a) The  income of the non-agricultural        population was not larger than that of the        agricultural population;    (b) It was based on the relative Income lam        yield.   But Income Tax as a rich man&apos;s        wax would provide a larger proportion of        the revenue in a richer country and a less        ,orportion of the revenue in a poorer        country;.   The result would be that on        this basis the taxable capacity of        Ireland was assessed at less than was        rorrect;    (. c] It took no ucocunt of the progressive        nature of United Kingdom taxation - a factor        which hasv of course, increased in importance        since Mr. Guilders&apos; Report in 1896;    (d) Ireland had always been exempt from certain        taxes such as railway duty, establishment          licences, patent medicines, land  tax and          inhabited house tax;    (e) The way in which Income Tax was levied  on        farmers gave  them an artificial benefit.        Profits were  taken for  Income Tax  assessment        purposes  as equivalent  to a third  oi  rent,        which was  too low an assessment.      For  these reasons the Treasury believed  thatMr. Childers&apos; figures were not  sound and could  not betaken as  the  basis oi a  reliable  calculation.Broadly speaking  it was  certain that Ireland  wasunder-taxea  prior to  1853, while  it was very doubtful  whether,  and if  so  to  what extent, ireland was over-taxed xrom 1855  -1921.
     The next Heaa of claim was in respect of theabandonment of the gold standard.&apos;.     lie felt thatit was somewhat extraordinary to put forward a claim in respect of transactions long after thefinal settlement of 1926.     But apart from that, he would consider theclaim on its merits.   In the view of the UnitedKingdom representatives the abandonment of thegold standard involved no loss to  the Free state as a -whole but rather a profit.   If the sterlingassets of the Irish jjree State were depreciated, soalso were the sterling liacilities, ana one had tobe set off against the other.   The disparity between prices and coot had been reduced as a resultof the abandonment of the gold standard, ana those parts of the world which had abandoned the goldstandard (e .g . certain Dominions,Scandinavia etc.)had suffered less from the economic depression thanthose countries which had attempted to maintain it.On the whole, therefore, he thought that theabandonment ol the golu standard was an advantage to the Irish Pree itate rather than a disadvantage,and if there was to be any claim he though it shouldbe from the United Kingdom, against xhe Irish freeState rather than the reverse.     The abandonment of the gold standard by theUnited Kingdom was, however, a purely domesticaffair which was the concern of the United Kingdomalone.   Several foreign countries had put forwardclaims for compensation in respect of loss on sterling balances, but these had been rejected and dropped;  they did not appear to have been regardedseriously oy the countries themselves.

CHAi&apos;lBiIRLAlR said, that  no  reference wasFONO. ........     contained in the  Irish  free  State  Memorandum to the             fact that it had  been agreed to submit the dispute as             to  the  methoo. of  apportionment  of  the Irish Free  State             share  01  the Roau Fund  to the arbitration of Sir  Henry             Ltrakosch,. and that both sides  had agreed.to accept  the             findings  of the arbitrator on the  matter. CC1RAGE.         MR.  CHAM5BRLAI&apos;$ said that  the Irish Free  State             claimed that the  United Kingdom Government v/as &quot;liable             to  redeem all British Token Coinage renderen             redundant in tho  Irish  Free State  by the issue of the             Rational  Coinage  there&quot;.    He  &apos;vMr. Chamoerlain)  had             before him a copy ci the Agreement made  in 1929 between             the two Governments, under which as a concession, the             British Government haa  agreed to redeem  United Kingdom             silver by ten instalments from April 1930, amounting in             the aggregate to   600-,000. .   The  United Kingdom             Government had carried  out that agreement, and he would             like to ask whether the validity of this particular             agreement was now repudiated.                 MR.  DE VALERA observed that the purpose  of the             present Conference was  to reach a final  settlement on             all the outstanding claims of the  Irish  Free  State.             This particular agreement was not  regarded by the             Irish Free State Government as in the same  category             as the agreements of 19 3 and 1926, but  in the             opinion of the Irish Free State all questions,             including this Coinage  question, which gave  rise  to  a             feeling of grievance ana unfairness should be brought             into the final settlement.                  In reply to Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s specific  question,
he stated that the Irish Free State aid not challengethe validity cf this agreement oi&apos;  1929 in  the  same  way as they challenged the valiaity oi the agreements of19 Ho ana 1926.     ivhii. hchLviij^  wished it tq be  understood thatwhile the Irish  Free State did net challenge  the validity of the agreement, they did regard it  as an unsatisfactory solution oi the problem.     Mfil. CPhduBLhLAlhr pointed out that the  claim wasthat the United Kingdom Government was liable   to redeem the coinage.     Ml. xhj &quot;Vrilu-inA repeated that in the view of theIrish director State this matter should be adjusted on grounds of natural justice.     iai\. ChidviBiikiiixilE thought that  it  was  important  toestablish as he understood to be the  case, that thiswas not a claim based on any legal considerations but was a claim that the agreement  actually  reached in  19 29had not constituted, in the view of the  Irish  j-ree  State,a fair  settdement.     Mi. ha Valuta,, agreed that  the Irish Ires  Statecase was that  a fair settlement haa not  been made.     Mi. GihUvd^jiihligllv pointed out that silver  coin  isonly legal tender for sums up  to 40/- ana that in  other similar cases, e.g.  Australia  and  the Union ox SouthAfrica, the United Kingdom had  consistently refused to redeem United  Kingdom silver.   Moreover,  it must beremembered that the  banks  in the United  Kingdom holdlarge stocks  of redundant  silver which  they had tocarry at a loss.
        MR. CHAM53RLAIN said that the Irish Free Stateclaimed the full amount of the profits derived by.theUnited Kingdom Government between the 1st April, 1922and the 9th September 1928, inclusive, from the circu-lation of British Treasury notes in the Irish Pree State,and from the Treasury notes or certificates required tohe held by the Irish Banks to cover their Mote circula-tion appertaining to  the area of the Irish Pree State.&quot;&apos;ith regard to the first part of the claim, it should beremembered that this circulation of United Kingdom noteswas a measure taken at the time purely in the interestsand for the convenience of the Irish Pree State.   It wasnot the idea cf the United Kingdom Government, or inaccordance with their wishes at the time, that thesenotes should circulate in the Irish Pree State after theGovernment of the Irish Pree State was in a position tohave a note issue of their own.   The Issue Department ofthe Bank cf England objected to the circulation of itsnotes outside this island.   In point of fact, 3ritishnotes did circulate in various parts of the Empire as,for example, in Malta and Gibraltar; it was always opento a territory to obtain profits of note issue by issuingits own notes.   In the view of the United KingdomGovernment it was an unjustifiable contention that theresp)onsitility for a note issue should fall exclusivelyupon them and the profits be shared with others,        MR. CHAMBERLAIN reminded the meeting that on-&apos;theprevious day Mr. McSntee had assented to the view thatthis was a moral and net a legal claim, based on tha factthat the Fund was found in 1926 to have been in deficitat the time of its transfer in 1922.    In accordance withthe general principles on which functions were transferred,
                                                       h / nthe Irish Pree State took over both the assets in      *(JUquestion and. the corresponding liabilities in the-state in which they existed at the date of transfer.There was clearly no legal claim, and if this proposalamounted in effect to an appeal to the sense of fairplay  &apos;    of the United Kingdom Government, it couldnot be considered alone, cut might be brought intoaccount in any general settlement.        MR, THOMAS observed that no record could he found of a clBim of this nature having been made before.        MR. McENTEE observed that before the waractuarial investigations took place from time to time,and steps were taken by parliament to deal with anydeficits on the fund.   Owing to the situation in Irelandafter the war, there was no proper opportunity ofactuarial investigation of the position until 1926, andit was certainly the case that when the fund was trans-ferred in 1922 the real position was not appreciated.        MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that, whatever might be theforce of this argument, it could not be applied to thisparticular claim alone, and the claim would, therefore,have to be considered in connection with other similarmoral claims.        MR. CHAMBERLAIN observed that with one exceptionthese claims did not involve any very large amounts ofmoney.(a)  National Health Insurance (Women&apos;s Equalisation) Fund.        The Irish Pree State claimed a portion of themonies ( 290,000) in the fund on the 1st April,  1922.The fund was, however,  wound up retrospectively  from the1st January,  1922,  and the monies in question weresurrendered to the  British Exchequer.    The United Kingdom
rejected the claim on the ground that the sums weresurrender able voted sums and not a non-surrenderablegrant-in-aid transferable to the Irish Free State.(b)  Ex-Enemy Itebts.        The Treaty provisions quoted in the IrishEree State memorandum deal with the liquidation throughthe Clearing Office of pre-war debts due from FreeState nationals to German and Austrian nationals and vice versa.   Under an agreement of 1923 the Free state was to make itself responsible for the collection ofdebts from its nationals (about  9,090) and to receiveas remuneration for their services commission and interest on the proceeds of the liquidation of ex-enemy property in the Irish Free State.   He understood thatthe Irish Free State were finding some difficulty incollecting these debts, and wished the British Govem-ment to take some responsibility for them.   It was difficult to see any justification for this contention,but he was quite prepared to discuss the matter orallyon the first opportunity.(c)  Quit Rents.        The point at issue here was whether the GrownRevenues from quit rents should have been payable tothe Irish Free State from the 1st April,  1922, orfrom the 6th December,  1922 (the latter date being thaton which the Constitution came into force).   The LawOfficers of the United Kingdom had advised in favourof the latter date, and the United Kingdom had, there-fore,  retained the revenue at stake.    Tho Irish FreeState Government had now raised a further point,  thatthe sums received in respect of the redemption of quit
1 orents in Ireland since 1391 ought not to have  beeninvested in England, but should have been invested in landed property in Ireland.    He (Mr.  Chamberlain)saw no justification for attempting to go hackretrospectively on past actions in this way,  or indeparting from the general rule by which the  actualassets at the date of transfer were handed over.        MR.  McENTEE pointed out that if, as he claimedwas the legal position, the monies in question hadbeen re-invested in Ireland, the land would have passed to the Irish Eree State Government.   Mr. Chamberlainsaid that if this new point was cased on some  legalconsideration he was prepared to examine it further.(d)  Read Rotes.        MR.  CHAMBERLAIN agreed that this particularmatter should be included in any general settlementthat might be reached.(e)  Post Office hennant Accounts.        MR.  CHAMBERLAIN said that this claim appearedto be one for a share of the assets but not for a shareof the liabilities, and he assumed that the latter hadbeen omitted from the claim by inadvertence.    Therewould be no objection to transferring assets  if theIrish Eree State would assume the corresponding liabilities, and also of course if the transfer of the assets
was agreed to by the depositors or their legalrepresentatives,        MR. McENTEE said that apart from thequestion of liability which might be discussed further the Irish Free State liabilities inquestion might be regarded as part of the public debt of the United Kingdom for which the Irish&apos;Free State had no responsibility.(f)  Death duties..        MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that the questionof Death Duties could not be considered alone,but must be examined as part of  the general question of double taxation, and in particularin connection with the whole question of IncomeTax.   The United. Kingdom Government were fullyprepared to discuss with the Irish Free StateGovernment the whole Double Taxation question,including the Death Duties and Income Tax aspectsef it.
     ME, THCMA3 thought that the position of thenegotiations, now  that the reply of the United KingdomGovernment to the  second Free state Memorandum had &quot;beenheard, might he summed up as follows:-     (a) The Free  State had advanced arguments of amoral-:, not a legal  character, which covered the subjects dealt with in tho agreements of 1923 and 1926,     (b) They had, in addition, made a general claim that Ireland had throughout the 19th Century been over- taxed,     (c) To this,  MR. CHAMBEFiAIN had indicated  that,in his view, there were strong grounds for maintaining that Ireland had been under-taxed in the first halfof the 19th Century.     It seemed to  him (MR. THOMAS) that&apos;most of  the factors which had  been brought to light in the presentdiscussion had been present in the minds of thosewho negotiated the Ultimate Financial Settlement of1926; his conclusion was  that in that agreement  theFree State had not made a bad bargain.     If Mr. de Valera wished it, the United kingdom delegation would gladly let him see in writing astatement of their case as it had been developed that morning.     MR. IS VALMRA said that he would be obliged ifthis could be done.     Dealing with  the question of Irish taxation, he went on to state  that, though he did not pretend to bein possession of exact figures,  he was certain thatthere had been gross over-taxation.    There was a
consensus of opinion to .thia effect among theauthorities (e.g. Sir A. Lie hcnneil) v/ho hadgene into the matter, and the Irish Pree Staterelegation were mere than ready to see the factsinvestigated anew.     The presumption was that Great Britain had usedits superior strength in order  to ensure for itself a oomparativeiy lighter burden  of taxation; hewas certain that investigation would sh^w  that asubstantial refund was due.   Irish opinion was very strong in the matter and the most exhaustive examinationwould he required before it could he  convinced thatit had been wrong.     ME. THOMAS thought that the prevailing impression in Ireland could he very largely accounted for by the psychological effect of continuous anti-british propaganda.     MR. GEGGKEGAN thought that the impression inIreland was due tr something more substantial thanignorant clamour.   It was true that Mr. Chamberlainhad suggested that Ireland had been under-taxed until1853, but he, Mr. Geoghegan, v/as prepared to prove that from 18CJ to 1853 there had been a large andsteady increase year by year in the Irish contributions to the Imperial Exchequer; and  a simultaneous steady increase in Ireland&apos;s impoverishment.    Things had turned cut very differently from the expectations whichhad been held out to the Irish Parliament when it hadbeen induced to agree to the Union of  1800,   It had
beer, suggested then that closer association withGreat Britain was certain to increase the prosperity of Ireland.   Even at that time the Irish representa-tives had heen unconvinced and had stipulated for a revision of their taxable ratio every 20 years, startingin 1830,   It v/as true  that the duty on spirits remained at a low level in Ireland throughout this period, butthe general taxation agreement v/as violated in 1617(without waiting for the revision of 18.2c) by  the parliament at Westminster, subjecting Ireland  toindiscriminate taxation.   This was done withoutany investigation into  relative capacities of payment and without any regard  to Ireland&apos;s progressiveimp over i s hmen t.     Turning to Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s argument that  theleniency of the income  tax towards agriculture had been of special benefit  to Ireland, MR. GEOGHEGAN claimed that the method of  assessing agriculturalists  to  incometax up to  toe  Great War had, on the contrary,  operatedto the disadvantage of  the Irish farmers.   It had worked as  a device  to extract from them large  sums which could never otherwise have been obtained.   Irishland-owners, paid their income  tax on the full value oftheir property, and in  addition the occupying  farmerson this property, were  charged with income tax on one-third of the annual value of  their holdings.   It was true that  where it  could be shown  that in fact noprofits were made,  no income tax was legally due  bythe farmer, but things  did not work cut in this way,and a poor cornmunity of farmers who kept no accurateaccounts could net  afford when they were running  theirfarms at a loss, the luxury of accountants and solicitors.
The result was that they paid the same tax in good yearsand had years alike.    It was no use their going to the tax collectors and saying that they were not liable .henthey could not prove  it.     MR. CHAMEERLATN  intervened to explain that this hadnot been his point,,   Ke had tried to show, not that theIrish farmer was more favourably treated than the Englishfarmer, but that agriculture everywhere had teen more favourably assessed than incus try.   This was a distinctadvantage to an agricultural country like Ireland.    &apos; MR. GE0GHEG.4N said that Ireland had an equally strong case on the 1 reader aspects of  taxation.   There v/asnothing, he thought,  In the argument that Ireland hadbeen free of income tax for a long period of years during which 1% had operated in Great Britain,   Theposition v/as as follows:-1800  to 1342        No income  tax  in either country.1342...............  Income tax imposed in Great Britain.1353                 Income tax imposed in Ireland.     MR, CHAMBBRLAIN intervened again. to  say thatincome  tax had been payable in  Great Britain from  thebeginning of  the century until 1816.     MR, GEOGHEGANVS impression v/as  that this was something different from the modern system cf incometax,  .   It was a  special measure of  war  taxationsuch as had been imposed once or  twice  in the 18thcentury.
        Ireland&apos;s overpayment of income-tax was, however,hy  no  means  the whole story.   The Childers Commission of1894 had reached similar conclusions over the v/hole field oftaxation,  and he had not thought until to-day that their conclusions were in dispute.   They were certainly inagreement  v/ith the evidence of economic witnesses &quot;beforethe Primrose Commission and v/ith speeches hy variousauthorities at Economic Congresses.       MR. THOMAS had heard nothing to make him change his view that  the position as a whole might remain where ithad been left by the ultimate Financial Agreement of 1926.       MR.  GE0GKEGA1T thought that in 1926, as in 1921 and1923,  the  Irish Delegates had really been allowed to makefools  of themselves.    There was not a scrap of evidence to prove that on any of these occasions the United KingdomGovernment had even known the true facts of the Irishcase.    The same had happened in the House of Commons in1920.    It was no use pretending that there had been anyexpert Irish criticism of the Government of Ireland Act,for it was well known that the Irish M.Ps.  had abstained from attending at Westminster  since 1918.       The Agreements of both 1923 and 1926 were completevictories for the British side, who had bluffed their opponents  throughout.    The United Kingdom representatives.-had been allowed to carry their point without any properinvestigation of the  general financial relationshipbetv/een the two countries.       MR.  GEOGHEGAN said that he would agree with one part of Mr. Thomas&apos; remarks, namely, that in which he saidthat the merits of the whole of the claims should be discussed.
The Irish Pree State had always considered that, on merits,their case v/as unanswerable.   If they had had to devote alot of time to the legal case it v/as &quot;because until yesterdaythey had had to rely solely on the British newspapers for theBritish view of the Irish arguments, which had been thereinrepresented not merely as fallacious but as consciouslyfraudulent.    No item of their case, however, rested entirely on legal considerations.   Some of their cases, for instance,those in the first memorandum were all of a double-barrellednature and were both legal  and meritorious.   There were alarger class of cases, namely, those in their secondmemorandum, which he personally would not put forward on technical legal grounds but  for v/hich the case, on their merits, was just as good as in the first class.    On thequestion of over-taxation,  for example, the Irish Pree state had an overwhelming case on merits.       In reply to Mr.  Chamberlain, who said that all theIrish Pree State claims appeared to have been made on thebasis of the Childers Commission figures, and that if thelatter could be proved to be wrong then the whole claims werewrongly founded,       MR.  GEOGHEGAN pointed out  that a Commission had en-quired in 1854 also into the taxibility of Ireland.    he agreed that while the Childers Commission had paid a lot of attention to income tax, there had been some difficulty  in arriving at  a measure of taxable  capacity.    The  case  mightbe put in a simple v/ay by having regard to the amount  ofuntaxable income left to British and Irish individualsrespectively.    In Great Britain over the period  in question,every individual had received a proper subsistence allowance,and a great many had more;   but in the same period in Ireland,especially in the agricultural areas, the population existedon less than the proper subsistence allowance.,   So far  from
                                                         A--9   there heing anything to t ax in Ireland the farmer and those directly dependent on him, living on little if anything above the subsistence allowance, were, in many cases, under- fed and underhoused.     Talcing,  for example,   150 a year as the bare subsistence allowance in each country.    If an Englishman had  160 a year and  9 were talc en  from him in  tax, he would complain.    In Ireland, if a man had  150, to tax him even 1/-  would give him a  legitimate  grievance.    The income tax was a  mirror of the economic position  of the countries, and so the Childers Commission was  right in building on it.        The Irish  Free State case v/as  also that  since  1893 their  country had been  overtaxed, although for  th at; period. they  did not  call in  aid any Commission.   They relied on the Treasury returns  which  established their  case for,  at  any rate the years 1895-1908.    They also relied on the  evidence given before  the  Primrose Committee  in 1911, and referred particu- larly to  the  evidence of the late Lord i/IcBonnell, a particular ly accurate witness and a United Kingdom  official who repre- sented  the  overtaxation of  Ireland  as continuing.    One of the main  contentions  of the Irish Free State representatives v/as that  the  country had been robbed of the machinery provided  in the Act of Union for  the revision of their financial position every twenty years.   While the Union had contemplated  that indiscriminate taxation should apply only when Irish prosperity had greatly increased,  it had actually been  introduced at an earlier date, in order to avoid the piling up  of  a high separate debt in Ireland.       In conclusion, Mr. Geoghegan added, their calculation of overtaxation had been made on the basis of  the  Childersand Primrose enquiries and had led to a claim  for   399million without interest.    That  figure, of course, applied to the whole of Ireland and once a claim had been  agreed inprinciple it would be liable to adjustment on  account of the separation of Northern Ireland.   There would  also remain a                            -20-
 few further details for settlement.       MR. DE VALERA did not think the Conference was getting much closer together on the points at issue.    It was the first time that he had heard it suggested that  a discussion  of the question of  overtaxation could not end in favour of Ireland&apos;s case.   His country had declined whilst Grtat Britain had progressed by leaps and bounds, and that  was a direct result of the. Act of Union.    The Primrose Committee had suggested that Ireland should be recouped by a grant of a subsidy of  3 million (the grant to take the form of Great  Britain&apos;s assumption of liability for Old Age Pensions in Ireland)  and the Act of 1920 had made provision of a similar kind v/hich took  the form of the gift of the Land Annuities.    Prom the Irish point of view the claim in respect of overtaxation was the most important item of their claim.    He  referred to Mr.  Thomas&apos;  statement during the discussion in the House of Commons of December 1925 on the Boundary Agreement and Article 5 of the Treaty.   Mr.Thomas had said -       &quot;I have heard the calculation of my Rt.  Hon. Friend that  the Treasury estimate was somewhere in the  region of   150,000,000 under Article 5.    I think  128,000,000 was the  first figure, with interest up to  150,000,000.......   It  was put to me tnat the estimate of the South of Ireland -  and  they have made some wonderful calculations  - was  280,000,000  due to them.    As one who knows something of the Irish  temperament in this matter, I quite frankly told my friends,  and I think it was the view of all of us who were connected  with it, that when we got down to brass tacks and attempted  to estimate any value so far as pounds, shillings and pence  were concerned, in the case of Article 5, we must write it  down as nil.............&quot;
     MR. CHAMBERLAIN suggested that all that this meant-was that Mr. Thomas did not accept the Irish calculation ascorrect, hut that no-one expected that anything would,in fact, even be paid by Ireland under that article.Mr. Thomas  said that Mr. Chamberlain had rightlyinterpreted his views.     MR. MeEIJTEE pointed out that it was not the viewof the present Irish Free State Government that the 1925Agreement did write down the counter-claims under Article5 to nil.     SIR JOHN SIMON said that, apart from technical consideration, he thought that one fact would be admittedon both  sides.   Supposing there had been no past history and it was  a question of the division of a Public debt of a country which had  been divided into two countries,it y/as  not  open to dispute that Article 5 would haveallocated a share cf  150 million of Public Debt to onecf the  parties.   But tc-day that share could not be claimed by  the  other  party since the Irish Free  state was no  longer liable  for it.   This fact must beallowed for in  any discussions on the question.     MR. DS VALLRA replied that he  did not  accept theestimate and  said  that  the Irish Free State Governmentregaided the monies which had been  paid by  theIrish  Free  State  in the last few  years as  in the natureof payments on  account  of  the Public Debt.   He  referred- particularly  to those in respect  of land  annuitie?3 and pensions.   The British Government, in this way, had got  a  debt  contribution through  the back  doer.
MR. DE VALERA added in regard to the 192 5Agreement that political considerations were involvedin the set -off  -  not only monetary claims  but  alsothe boundary settlement.With regard to the assets,the Irish Free State claim v/as that unless the  formerUnioni v/as  a  bankrupt  concern they should have a  shareof assets;they claimed also reparation for unfairtreatment while within the partnership.    Any contributionto the public debt was written down as nil by the Agreementof 1925;  that Agreement did not extinguish the counter-claim.     On the question of over-taxation, no authoritativecalculation had ever been made that had not shown vast  sumsin favour of Ireland.   This v/as recognised in the act of 1920 by the &quot;gifts&quot; therein made to northern and southern Ireland.     MR. THOMAS inquired what the ideas were as to future procedure.     MR. GEOGHEGAR observed that they had not dealt withthe other matters referred to in Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s openingstatement at  that meeting.&apos;     MR. THOMAS  said that the position was that the IrishJ^ree State Representatives had heard the views of the UnitedKingdom representatives, and that the United kingdom representatives  had heard the views of the Irish Free Staterepresentatives,but that the two sides did not appear to bemuch nearer.     MR. McENTEE said that the expression of tho variousooints  of view  at least afforded a background against which,and  showing  the  direction in which, each side was moving.
     MR.  DE VALERA said that he regarded theConference as engaged upon the consideration of (whatwas always contemplated) an ultimate financial settlement,   He said that there had now been someyears for consideration of the working of the variousarrangements which had been in operation, and it waspossible to see how things had turned out.   If thetwo countries were to get along in harmony at allit was worth while trying further to clear the. ground.     It was agreed to adjourn until 3 p.m.when discussions would be resumed cn the ether items(apart from the question of over-taxation) dealtwith in Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s statement.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.7.1.    15th October, 1932.

11             MRlMcSMTEE said that he had one point to makeJ3FXftTION.   v/ith regard to the question of over-taxation.   He         understood Mr. Chamberlain to say that the measurement         of taxable capacity by income tax was not accurate in         the case of Ireland owing to the method of taxation of         the farmers.    He could not see how that applied.    On         the contrary, his view was that on that basis of payment         Ireland had paid more than her due share relative  to her         capacity.    It was universally agreed that the rents paid         by the farmers in Ireland had been uneconomic rents         beyond their capacity;  and, they were paid  to the         landlords who were assessed for income tax on the full         amount of those rents.   So far as this was  done the         amount paid in income tax by the landlords was very         excessive relative to the Country1s taxable  capacity.         This argument was reinforced by the views of the Childers&apos;         Commission.              Looking at the matter from another angle, - during         the period of excessive rents,  the population of Ireland         was continually declining.   Mr.Geoghegan had that morning         referred to  the question cf the maximum taxable capacity         of the individual as being the  amount of his income  in         excess of the bare amount required for subsistence.         But the conclusion to be drawn from the continuous decline         of population was that, under conditions  then existing         which, in the Irish Pree State representatives&apos; view,         included over-taxation, the Irish people were unable  to         find subsistence and had to leave their country.   In         other words,  so far as those people were concerned,  there         was no &quot;taxable capacity&quot;.                                - 1 -
     MR.GHAMBSSLAIN felt that it would not he useful 4&apos;*^pursue the argument under that head.    He had endeavoured to give an account of the reasons for which the calculation of Mr.Chillers had not teen accepted bythe United Kingsom representatives, though he appreciates.that those reasons might not appeal to the Irish FreeState representatives.     MR.McSNTEE observed that they had brought forwardone strong argument which had not been met;   they regarded the admitted -poverty cf Ireland as a very bigfactor in the situation from this point of view.     MR.THOMAS said that there was nothing incompatible with  the arrangements made in 192 , namelv, that on agive-and-take basis the claims of both sides  were wipedout.   In making  those arrangements the Question of over-taxation was no doubt fully considered.     MR. McEITTEE said  that, so far  as  the Irishrepresentatives were aware, the question cf over-taxationhad never been taken into consideration in this way,although it had for long been a major political issue in Ireland, and the view that Ireland had been over-taxed had received full support from  all sides in Irishpoli tics.     In reply to  further questions MR.McSNTE3 explainedthat in referring to  the Chillers&apos; Commission, he had done so on the footing that the views of Mr.Chillers,as  a British representative and Chairman of  a RoyalCommission, were  he &quot;thought,  likely to afford common ground as between the Treasury and Ireland.   Mr.Chillersrepresented the minimum, from the  Irish point of view,not the maximum claim.   There had been subsequentinvestigations carried out in Ireland which  had taken the matter further.   He referred  to  the work of
Professor Oldham of the National University who,working on figures given by. Mr. Sexton- in 18 9 5 of .2903OCO,OOC, ha-1 assessed the gross amount of over-taxation in 1912 as  550,000,000, and by a subsequentfurther investigation after the war had brought it up to  599,000,00 0.     MR.McEHTES sail that the basis of their claim wason&apos;clear figures, namely, of the amount of Irish FreeState investments in British Government securitieswhich amounted  to approximately  70,000,000 and inBritish industrial securities which might be put at 150,000,000.   The effect of the abandonment of theGold Standard was to write down  the value of thesesecurities by 25^.   While he admitted that  there wasno legal  claim, he felt that it was not  in  accord withtile British  tradition  of paying  20/-  in  the    thatthis loss should  be thrown on the Irish Free State.     As regards the question of  possible  loss  sustained by British investors in Irish Free  State  securities  onthe same basis, he thought  that  that  would prove a  smallitem compared with the Irish Free State  loss.     MR.THOMAS  suggested  that  the people  who had  investedtheir money  in  British securities were,  on the whole,&quot;shaking  hands  with  themselves&quot;  now.     MR.McEHTSE replied  that  if  the people,  had invested in dollar securities at  the same time,  they would now beable  to realise those  dollar  securities  and,  if  they desired,  buy with the  proceeds  an  increased nominalamount  of sterling securities  as a  result.     LORD HAILSHAM enquired whether that  applied  in  thecase cf industrial investments  in  the United States
     MR. McENTEE agreed that industrial investments haddepreciated everywhere, and he admitted that an investorin on industrial security might he regarded as talcingthe ordinary commercial risks.   He thought, however,that an investor in a British Government security might reasonably have regarded himself as taking no .risk cfloss.     MR.THOMAS suggested that, on the whole, if mr.McSntee canvassed the opinion of people in the IrishFree State they would regard themselves as havingbenefitted by the abandonment of the Gold Standard.     MR.McENTEE denied this view.   He said that the argument that prices had been maintained at a stable level on the sterling basis only means that in fact theIrish Free State was confined to sterling market forthe purchase of goods;  they could not purchase outsidethat market without serious loss,     MR.DE VALERA said that while in all the circum-stances it was perhaps not correct to describe theabandonment of the Gold Standard as &quot;repudiation&quot;,  theeffect of it on the Irish Free State was the same  asthat of repudiation.   He still felt that,  if the  matter were gone into fully,  it would be found that the IrishFree State had sustained a substantial loss.   Theamount which they could be shown  to have lost was  of adefinite character, while the various sets-off referredto by Mr, Chamberlain were quite una s c e r t a i nab le  in amount.     He felt, however, that it v/as unlikely that  themeeting would be  able  to reach a  definite  conclusion on the question.
 ROAD        MR.  TjE VALERA said that  he was  aware  that his  claimD.        for a revision of the  Road  Board  s allocation of grants        had &quot;been  submitted with the agreement  of the Treasury to        the arbitration of Sir Henry  Strakosch.    The question        new was whether that arbitration  should be allowed  to        proceed,  or whether the matter should  be taken into the        proposed  comprehensive settlement.             MR.  DE VALERA said that  here again Free State        interests were being prejudiced by what they regarded as        an inequitable agreement.   The British case, he knew,        was that  binding agreements could not  be re-opened;  hut        if there  was really to be a comprehensive  settlement the        re-opening of such agreements was surely not to be        regarded  as an un-heard-of  thing.RENCY.        MR.  THOMAS said that the Free State had become        entirely  at liberty immediately it had been set dp  to make        whatever  currency arrangements it thought  best.   It had,        in fact,  found it convenient  to continue using British        currency  notes;   the introduction of the Irish Free State        note  issue had only followed  after a period of years.             MR.  DE  VALERA said that  the  Free  State&apos;s use of        British currency notes after  the  Treaty was a matter of        necessity,  not  of convenience;  in practice it was  quite        impossible  for  a new State  to issue its own notes at once        without a preliminary  period  for  investigations,        preparations  etc.             MR.  McENTEE said  that  British traders would, in fact,        have  been greatly inconvenienced  if the Free State had        issued  its  own currency notes within,  say,  six months        after the  Treaty.                               - 5  -
      MR.  53 VALERA said that  whatever  the  reasons might- have been, British notes had  remained  in circulation and the profits had accrued to the  British Treasury.   In his memorandum he had claimed the  full amount of those profits.    If, however, the British  Treasury could prove its right to any part of the  sum he  was willing tc compromise.      MR.  THOMAS said  that  he  regarded  the Pree State claim under  this head as so&quot; far-fetched that he had thought at first that it must have been accidentally inserted  in  the memorandum.      MR.  PS  VALE PA  explained  that there was a difference between the  claims  included in  his first memorandum (that transmitted  with his  letter of  12th  October) and those included  in  his second.    The first  memorandum dealt -with the  immediate  items of  controversy.   Here a settlement was  urgently necessary.   When, however, it had been suggested  that  advantage might he taken of the negotiations to make a  comprehensive  settlement, he had gone further afield;  his second memorandum was accordingly an indication of  the many items which he thought must  he included if  there were to he a genuine comprehensive settlement.   He was  anxious to avoid leaving &quot;loose ends&quot;behind.    If these were  left they would only be the cause of controversies at some later date.     Thore could be no question of settling all thesemiscellaneous items in the course of a few hours&apos;conversation.   The enquiries of the Childers  Commission had,he believed,- occupied three years.    The Pree  Statedelegation were at the disposal  of the British  Government,and were ready to examine any and every point  in  detail,with minds open to conviction.
     MR. CHAMBERLAIN asked whether&apos; Mr. de Valera meant that there  should be an examination of these miscellaneous items  in order  to see how far they could constitute a set-off against the Land Purchase Annuities.   - MR. BE VALERA said that this was not his meaning. He thought that matters had come to a stage where, if there  was to be a financial settlement at all, it must be the ultimate financial settlement envisaged by the Treaty. The Free State contention was that the agreements cf 1923 and 1926 were invalid;  but even if they were wrong in this view, and those agreements were valid, they could only be regarded really as provisional settlements.   The ultimate financial settlement was still to be made.     MR. CHAMBERLAIN enquired whether the reference was to Article 5 of the Treaty.     MR. DE VALSRA assented.     MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that it was definitely theUnited Kingdom view that this article had been implemented&quot;by the Boundary Agreement and the Financial Settlement of 1926.     Might he refer to the argument which had been used by Free State Ministers earlier that day - namely, thatwhen those agreements had been under discussion the UnitedKingdom had been ignorant of the Irish case in the matter of over-taxation in the past;  that accordingly this case had not been taken into account in making those agreements;and that it ought to be taken into  account now.     He (Mr. Chamberlain)  would , of course, be glad to hear that case now, though he was not prepared to modifyhis view regarding the final character of the 19S6
                                                       U9settlement.   It was not the case, however,  that theIrish arguments had never been considered by UnitedKingdom Ministers before.   Me had before him a FreeState memorandum in four pages,  of October 1921, whichhad been considered by United Kingdom Ministers beforethe conclusion of the Treaty.   The gist of that memorandum was that this country was at that date indebt to Ireland tc the amount of  727 millions;  andit set out the data and arguments of the &quot;over taxation&quot;case.     MR. DE VALERA said that he remembered the memorandum:it had been prepared at a time -when the Irish representa-tives had thought that the political Treaty would be accompanied by a dissolution then and there of thefinancial partnership.     MR. CHAMBERLAIN pointed out that the claim then madewas much higher than that which Mr. de Valera was nowpressing.   The document, at any rate, proved thatthe Irish claim had been known here ever since October,1921.     MR. DE VALERA said that whatever might have been intended in October, 1921, the Treaty had made provisionfor the ultimate financial settlement.   The Free Statedelegation were nov; prepared with their statement of set-&apos;offs and counter-claims und.er Article 5.     He knew that Lord Hail sham did not share his viewof that article, but he (Mr. de valera) could not readit as excluding the case in which the Free State
counter-claims might exceed the United Kingdom  claims,and payment on balance might be due to the free State.Any interpretation excluding this possibility would be most inequitable;   it would mean that the authors  ofthe Treaty had pre-judged the financial settlement.     MR. CHAMBERLAIN reminded Mr. de Valera that a document was in existence which proved a knowledgeamong the Treaty negotiators on both sides that theIrish counter-claims might be as high as  727 millions.The Free State share of the public debt of the  UnitedKingdom was estimated at the time of the Treaty at 153 millions.   what had happened in 1925?  Ministerscn both sides, with this knowledge in their possession,had agreed that the whole Irish liability in respect ofthe public debt should be waived - and the counter-claims with it.   The settlement might be looselydescribed as a set-off of a debt of  158 millions againsta more indefinite claim estimated by Mr. ae valera&apos;sadvisers in 1921 at  727 millions (though this  was not  a figure which the British Treasury could accept).     He (Mr. Chamberlain) had wondered whether  the FreeState Ministers would now produce any new arguments tosupport their case.   He had heard nothing but  theold familiar arguments;  and had been compelled, inreply, to give reasons for considering some of  thefigures involved as fantastic;  but none of this couldalter the fact of the final character of the existing financial settlement.
     SIR JOHN SIMON said that with, all the facts in mindboth sides had agreed in 1925 to cry quits.    there could be no difference of opinion between reasonablemen that that was what had happened.     MR. DE VALERA wished to repeat his view that a nation co\ild not be bound by an Agreement like thatof 1926 without ratification by its Parliament.   the trend of modern practice v/as all against the Unitedkingdom view that sucn documents became bindingimmediately on their signature by Ministers.   the modern view v/as that if, in a particular case,ratification was held to be unnecessary the fact shouldbe expressly stated in the instrument itself.      He could not accept Sir gohn Simon&apos;s view thatin 1925 both sides had in fact called quits, for theFree State had ever since been making annual payments in respect cf what was part of the British public debt.     MR. THOMAS reminded Mr. de valera that the FreeState delegation had been proved wrong in theirassertion that British Ministers had not been aware ofthe Irish case in 1921.    He understood that Mr. de valera had now shifted his ground, and was claiming that the Irish case could not have been considered,because tie consequences of the Treaty v/ere so unfair to Ireland.   This however, was surely not a tenableposition.     MR. DE VALERA said he was referring to 1925 and
     lvH.xIiOi.i_io referred to the great number of conferences with the Irish Government since the treaty and thought it inconceivable that the Irish negotiatorsdid not have the present Irish claims, lor example, thatin regard to over-taxation, in their minds at thoseconferences, just as much as at the present meeting.     MR.ClLiLfBEELAIN read the words of Article V of theTreaty and pointed out that Article II of the BoundaryAgreement released the Irish Tree State from the sameliability as was imposed on it under the Treaty article.Any counter claim could bo made only against thatliability, and since the liability no longer existed, itwas no longer possible for a counter claim to be put in.The Irish Free State could of course have put in a claim(not a counter claim) on other grounds, but in the 1S26Agreement the whole matter had been closed, and it wasnecessary to make it clear that no such further claim cculdnow b e e nt e rt ai ne d.     MR.GEOGBEGAN thought that if he personally and  others who supported the Tire at y had so interpreted the Treaty in1921 events would have taken a different turn.   they expected that the Irish Free State hell at least a  chanceof a net payment to them under the Article.     SIR JOHN SIMON asked what was the liability referredto in Article V;   was it gross or net?   He felt  sure that it was net.    The settlement of 1925, therefore,similarly dealt with a net liability  - that is, with  bothsides  of an account.      MR. DE VALERA asked whether it was the British view-that under Article v the Irish Free State could ever havebeen judged    have money owing to her.       SIR JOHN SIMON agreed that there was some difference                            -11-
between a counter claim and a set-off.   The latter was some-thing closely connected with the subject-matter of the originalclaim and could properly be set-off in reduction of that claim,whereas a counter claim related to an entirely separate matter.Article V, no doubt, contemplated that a counter claim couldbe lodged, tut the Boundary Agreement must be regarded as wipingout both the gross claim and anything which the Irish PreeState might set up in reduction or in overtopping of that claim.In fact, in agreeing to Article II of the Boundary agreement the Irish Free State no doubt regarded a bird in the hand asworth several in the bush.   From their debt liability therewas no hope of escape.   On the other side, they might make animpalpable and shadowy counter claim, to which no figure hadbeen put.   Ireland&apos;s problem, therefore, was whether it was worth while to get rid of a real burden ef definite amount,even though that entailed giving up unmeasured claims on theother side of the account which might, in certain circumstances,exceed that amount.       MR.GEOGHEGAN argued that if Article Y dealt merelywith claims relating to the national debt it involved an assump-tion that Great Britain was bankrupt.   Were there not on theother side assets to consider, like-, the Crown Colonies andBritish warships?       MR.MAGTJIRE pointed out that the wording of the articlesupported the Irish contention.       MR. BE VALSSA preferred to consider the interpretation of Article V as it would, have been given in 1921, rather thanin 1925, and it would then surely have permitted of Irelandbeing credited for her over-taxation.   It would have beentruly absurd for Irish negotiators to have made an agreement which gave up so large a claim as the  727,000,000 claimed in1921 and not provided for its overtopping the British claim.       MR .MAGUIRE added that although figures were presented
in 1921 during the Treaty discussions,  the Treatymerely arranged how the question should he dealt within the future.   No investigation of the figures v/asthen carried o\it.   Indeed the Irish Free State complaintv/as not that any wrong decision had been given in  regardto their claim in respect of over-taxation, hut rather that it had never been investigated at all.   Even in1925 the Irish ,?ree State had not presented their  claim under Article 5 in answer to the British claim for adebt contribution.   It was unnecessary to go into thehistory of the matter.   Everybody knew that the BoundaryAgreement had been arrived at in a hurry, and neither side had ever considered the financial case fully.    TheBritish figures relating to Article V had never beenaccepted.     MR. THOMAS, summing up the position at which  theConference had arrived, said that when both Governmentsagreed to meet they also agreed to see if it were possible TO arrive at a settlement that would be asettlement of the differences outstanding between them,that is, in relation to the Land Annuities and other payments which were being withheld.   The Irish FreeState representatives now said that they had withheldthe monies because they did not thinx that payment v/aslegally binding, and that even if it were there still remained the question of equity involving the general financial relations between the two countries going back to the Act of Union.   The British Governmentreplied that so far as they v/ere concerned they not onlybelieved that the payments were legally binding underagreements, which should be maintained, but that if the
Irish Free State Government were really anxious  tostibmit some other factors that ought tc be taken intoconsideration in connection with the items in dispute,they, that is the British Government,  would examinethem end see whether there was anything in the equitableclaims of the Irish Free State that would warrant theirtaking a different view of the matters in dispute.   TheConference had previously dealt with the disputed itemsand to-day they had examined all the facts at their disposal regarding the bigger claim on the moral side.with a sincere desire to put the most generous inter-oretation on that claim, the British Government  did  not feel that the Irish Free State had put forward any new factors.   Apart from questions which had arisen since1926 (for example, claims in connection with the goldstandard and the currency note issues) all the mattersraised had been settled by previous agreements.   after two days of friendly ana frank discussion the position was that on the one hand the Irish Free State aid not regard themselves as legally bound in connection withthe items immediately in dispute, while on the otherhand, the British Government thought they were so bound.On the other items no new arguments had been brought forward which would warrant the British Government inbelieving the existing financial arrangements to be unfair.   In such a situation, what did Mr. de Valerasuggest that the Conference should do?   It would be asad blow to the British Government if, after two days ofsuch frank expressions of opinion, in which each government had been guided by a single-minded desire to dothe right thing by their own countries, the settlement which each side so sincerely desired could not be reached.
 o-cne would attempt to deny that the existing position wasnob to the  advantage of either party,  and both desired tosee it ended, but it v/as idle for either side to pretend that they were nearer a practical solution,  and he woulda sic Mr. de Valeria how he would suggest that  they would get out of t:ne impasse.     M&apos;R. DE VALERA said that while he could  not, of course,accept Mr.Thomas&apos;s deductions from the  facts, he agreed generally  with his concluding remarks,  and in particular  thatit was not likely that either side would be  able to con-vince the other.   In the circumstances it seemed to him that there were only two possible alternatives, either there might be a decision tc approach the whole problem from adifferent angle, or- there might be resort to arbitration.The position with regard to - rtitr^tion had developed into  avery difficult one, -no. the legal position was also very-complex and involved.   In the result the Irish Free state had, until recently, paid to&apos; the United Kingdom Governmentlarge sums of money in respect of which public opinion inthe Irish Free State repudiated liability.  He could onlysuggest that the question should be  referred, as he hadalready offered, to an independent arbitrator, and that  each side should then endeavour to make its case to the arbitrator.Generally speaking his idea was that the whole matter shouldbe treated  as though there had been a dissolution ofpartnership.  The arbitration would then relate to the division of the partnership assets;  the question to bedetermined being; whether, apart altogether from the agreements,the Irish Free State ought in justice to pay any money to theUnited Kingdom,     MR. THOMAS said that with regard to the land Annuitiesand the other disputed payments named in the first Memorandum,he wished the Irish Free State representatives tc understandthat he was in a position to examine the questions at issuefrom an impartial standpoint, in as much as at the time  ofthe Irish Treaty he was not a member of the British Govern-ment, and was in Opposition.   After giving the matter most                          - 15 -
careful consideration, and after making all allowances for historical and other factors, he had come to the definite conclusion that the arguments and oonsider-ations which had influexiced those responsible for whatwas done, both at the time of the Treaty and at thetime when the subsequent agreements of 19u3 and 19 6were made, would have influenced him in exactly thesame way and guided him to precisely the same conclusions.           .. ith regard to the wider issues raised in thesecond Memorandum and in the arguments which had been used at tne Meetings, he felt that the knowledge which&quot;v/as available on the subject to-day differed, verylittle fram the knowledge which v/as available to thosewho had negotiated the Treaty and the subsequentagreements.   It must be admitted that the figures which had been na...ed in regard GO the contention that Ireland dad been ever-taxed in the past were,in tne main, guess work, and that it would be most difficult,, if not impossible, to establish at thepresent time to the satisfaction of any Court, theactual annual figures of a period so long ao0 as 100years.   The figures which Mr . G-e ughegan had namedcould, no dovfot, be totalled, but their correctnessoould not, in his view,  be proved..            What troubled him (Mr.Thomas) was thatthis was the fourth occasion on which an attempt hadbeen made with all sincerity on each side to surmountthe difficulties,  and that after an exhaustive
examination the representatives of the two governments were no nearer a settlement than when the questions at issue had been discussed in Dublin earlier in theyear .          ME;. DE VALEPA observed that each sidesincerely ana conscientiously hell to its own pointox view, and this did not make an approach any easier.He felt unable to add anything to what he had already said.   In his considered opinion it was unfair andunjustifiable that the Irish &quot;Eree State should becalled upon to pay anything to the United Kingdom.          ICS. THOMAS recalled that at an earlier stage oi the dispute there had been a tendency foreach side to talk at, rather than to, the other side.It sooxi appeared that the real issue turned on thequestion of the validity of the 1923 and 1926 agree-menta:,.   He (Mr.Thomas) had then suggested that thisquestion should be referred to arbitration, and theUnited Kingdom Government had accordingly offeredarbitration on the lines contemplated at the ImperialConference of 1930.   The Government of the IrishFree State had accepted arbitration, but had refusedto be limited as regards the choice of the arbitratorto some person within the British Commonwealth ofITations.   The United Kingdom Government had maintained
their view that the arbitrator must be a person from within the Commonwealth, and had given their reasons which it was unnecessary fir him to repeat.   At thesame time the United Kingdom Government were preparedto vary in certain other respects the arrangementcontemplated by the Imperial Canference.   The IrishFree State Government had found themselves, however,unable tc accept the suggested compromise .    The.position seemed to be the same to-day, with thisdifference:  that the United Kingdom Government, inorder tc demonstrate their anxiety ior a settlement,had decided to agree that the present discussions should proceed on the widest possible basis, so as toensure that if the Irish Free State had any now point to make, or new argument to urge, there would be anopportunity for their representations to be considered on behalf of the Government oi the United Kingdom.,Mr.Thomas said that he was prepared to renew thesame offer, namely to refer to arbitrators selected from within the Empire the question whether these agreements are valid or not.   That was the only-suggestion which he felt able to make.          ME. BE.VALERA said that this proposal hadbeen ruled out by the Irish Free State Government onthe previous occasion when it had been made, and thatGovernment was not prepared to reconsider the
                                              3 0 Udecision then reached.          MR) IlcShTJSS said that whatever the 1926agreement might bo whether valid or invalid, itwas not in fact what it purported to be - a finalfinancial settlement.   If the present Conferencebroke up without any agreement being reached he wished to warn the United Zingdcni representatives that they would most certainly to faced in thefuture with the same claims and the same arguments which had been made on the present occasion.&quot;nether the agreements of 1325 and 1326 werevalid or invalid agreements, there had in the viewof the Irish Free State representatives never been any final financial settlement.          SIR THOMAS IKSItIP thought that it was common ground that a certain number of points hadbeen finally settled by the agreements in question.          MR. McEIiTEE was not prepared to admit thatthis was so.   ITo future Government in the IrishFree State would ever acquiesce in the view thatthe Agreement of 192 6 .was a final settlement ofthe Free State 1s financial relations with great britain.          MR. ClhlMBEBLAIIT enquired whether the IrishFree State would be convinced by and would accept an arbitration award.          MR. BE VALERA said that&quot;arbitration ofthe kind suggested by Mr. Thomas, namely, that
 based on the recommendations of the Imperial Conference of 193C, would settle nothing.    Public opinion in the Irish Pree State v/as definitely opposed to  the idea of arbitration of that sort, as a result of their experience of the Boundary Commission&apos;s award.    It was out of the question to ho oe that the award  of an arbitration tribunal, such as Mr.  Thomas had suggested, would meet with general acceptance in the Irish Pree State.    If there was to be arbitration each side  must be at liberty to  select its own arbitrators  from wheresoever they  desired.         MR.  THOMAS  said that  the  representatives of the Irish Pree  State  were constantly stressing  the importance  of public  opinion  in Ireland.   They must, however,  bear in  mind that  English public opinion felt very  strongly in  regard to  this matter  and v/as  a factor v/hich no  United Kingdom Government could  disregard. While it  v/as  true that  the  Imperial  Conference Resolution was couched  in somewhat vague  terms  it did recognise the fundamental fact  that  the members of  the British Commonwealth  of nations had  adopted this particular method of  settling their  disputes because they were all members of  one family, and because they objected to the suggestion  that  it was not possible to find within the Commonwealth impartial and judicialpersons who could act as arbitrators in cases of dispute between members of the Commonwealth.        MR. BE VALERA said that  he could very readily conceive of circumstances in which it might  be very
 desirable to call in persons outside  the. Commonwealth. to arbitrate on disputes between members cf the Commonwealth.    7/hy was it necessary  to  have this artificial restriction?   On the analogy of family quarrels,  surely experience indicated that  an outsider v/as often a better peace-maker than a member of  the family.    On general principles, therefore,  if this question was being discussed at  the present  time by an Imperial Conference,  he would strongly oppose  any restriction of  choice on the ground that  there wouldbe  nothing  to be  gained by  it, that it would  tend to limit resort to  arbitration, that  it would be most unwise therefore  and would  do more harm  than good.        MR.  THOMAS  observed  that Mr.  De  Valera&apos;original objection  to the proposal was to the effectthat in the  case  of a tribunal,  the members of which were drawn from  within  the Commonwealth, the  scales would beweighted against  the  Irish Eree  State.        MR. DE VALERA said  that  this v/as  one of hisarguments against  the proposal, but it was not the onlyargument.   He repeated  that  there v/as the strongest possible feeling  in  the  Irish Eree State  against  a tribunal of this character.   This feeling was directlyattributable to the Peetham Award, which v/as regarded inthe Irish Eree State as unjust and indefensible in thehighest possible degree.
         MR. CHAMBERLAIN Said that the impression left on his mind was that the Irish people were  so constituted that they would never accept  any decision by any tribunal, however,  composed,  which v/as not  in accordance with their views.         MR. I)S VALERA recalled the historical background and contended  that  the lands to which the Land Purchase Annuities related were the  rewards given  in the  past to military adventurers from England and elsewhere.   As a matter of State policy,  the  British  Government had found it  desirable to convert  that  land rewards into money, and it  was manifestly unfair to  ask the  citizens of  the Irish Free  State,  from whom the land  had been taken, tc pay compensation tc the  persons who  had  deprived them of it.         SIR  THOMAS IMSXI? enquired whether if an award was made by  an  arbitration tribunal  composed  of persons from outside the Commonwealth and  that award was in favour of the United Kingdom contention,  the Irish Free State would  refuse to accept it.        MR. LE  VALERA said that  the circumstances were such as  to maice it necessary to  acquiesce in such an arbitral award, but  it would be  regarded  as an unfair apd unjustifiable award.   Speaking for himself,  he felt so strongly on  the matter that he could only say that  ifhe was in a position to resist and had behind  him sufficient force to ensure success, he would not  assent to any payments being made to the United Kingdom, andwould not therefore take the risk of  arbitration  at all.
     ME.  THOMAS observed that Mr.  de Valera&apos;s  statementshewed hew very difficult the whole position was.    Ashe understood it, Mr.  de Valora new nail that  if the arbitration award went against the Irish Free  State, itwould be regarded as unfair and would he resisted andrepudiated with all the force that might be  available.     MR.  DE VALERA said that he did not accept Mr.  Thomas&apos;3interpretation of his statement, bat, feeling  as he didwith regard to this matter, no could not take  the riskwhich would be involved in agreeing to submit  to artitra-fion, by a tribunal composed as Mr. Thomas suggested, thequestion of the validity of the agreements.     MR. DE VALERA added that he could not undertake thatif a payment of money were still to continue from theIrish Pree State to great Britain any  such settlement would be regarded as final.   whether  the settlement was by arbitration 01- by agreement, he would do his best ofcourse, but could not guarantee final  acceptance by  thepeople of tho Irish Pree State  if payments to GreatBritain were to  continue.     MR. 0HAM5ERLAIK asked Mr.  de Valera whether hisposition was that there would be no settlement  satisfactory to the people of the Irish Pree State  which resulted inany monetary payment from Ireland to Great Britain.     MR. DE VALERA  said  that  that was  so.     MR. THOMAS  said  that  on the  other side the view inthis country was equally strong.   Ho  British Government,whatever its political  complexion, and certainly not thepresent Government,  could  accept  that  situation.
                                                      A r* r-     MR. DE VALERA said that at times governments had, for the sake of small things, cut across thelines which could lead to peace.   He realised,however, that there were limits to which governments could go in advance of public opinion.   His viewv/as that if there were to te any payments cf money from the Irish Free State tc Great Britain therewould be a constant demand for revision.     In reply to further questions, he said that ifthe United Kingdom Government wanted a final settle-ment with no question cf re-opening at any time, itwould have to be a settlement which left the IrishFree State owing nothing to England;  otherwise any future Irish Government would be likely to re-open it,     MR. THOMAS said that he did not believe that any british Government could, for one moment, admit sucha claim as that.     MR. McENTEE suggested that if Great Britain were at any time in similar circumstances her positionwould be the same.   The Irish Free State were tryingtc wipe out a long-standing dispute that had lastedfor many years.   They wished to have no furtherirritants.   The peoples of Great Britain and the IrishFree State ought to be able to live side by side infriendship.   They were asking the United kingdom representatives to see their point of view.   Theywere only explaining that so long as there was moneybeing paid in respect of Irish land there was bound to                           24.
be irritation.     MR. THOMAS said that his considered view wasthat there was no justification for wiping out themoney payments;  nor did he believe that an impor-tial examination of the facts would support such aview.     MR. McENTEE suggested that in the circumstances there could not be any impartial examination at aConference such as the present.   Representatives on both sides were strongly confirmed in their parti-cular views on the matters at issue.     LORD HAILSHAM said that it was quite true thatthe losing side in an arbitration often felt theaward to be unjust.   It would not necessarily followhowever, that the grievance so rankled as to leadto repudiation or a claim that the award should notbe implemented.   The United Kingdom had&quot; always feltthat they had been unfortunate in arbitrations, butthey had never attempted to re-open any settlementsso reached.     MR. DE VALERA said that the arbitrations towhich Lerd Hailsham had referred were for the BritishGovernment relatively unimportant matters.   He askedwhether there v/as anyone who thought that the con-continental peace treaties could survive.   Y/hen the issues v/ere so serious and of such vital importance
it was impossible ta guarantee that no questionof re-opening would ever anise.   The greater the burden the greater the feeling of injusticeand the stronger would be the tendency to re-openany settlement.   Of course the re-opening and revision of agreements was not unheard of in international relations.     MR. THOMAS said that the United kingdom representatives would report to the Cabinet theresult of the discussions.  In addition, theywould circulate their observations on the secondmemorandum put in by Mr. de valera. .     He felt that he ought to say that the UnitedKingdom representatives deeply regretted that they found themselves unable to report any progress.     As regards the published documents, these would,he suggested, consist of Mr. de Valera&apos;s first and second memoranda and the two United Kingdom notes inreply.   Any additional memorandum sent  in by theIrish Free State representatives suuld be addedthereto.     MR. DE VALERA enquired what was the position ofthe United Kingdom representatives.   He said thatthoy had asked his opinion and he had given it frankly.He would be glad if they wtsuld tell him what theywould regard as a satisfactory settlement.
     SIR JOHN SIMON enquired whether Mr. he Valera&apos;s view was that the only obstacle was the actual payment ofmoney by the Irish Free State to the United Kingdom.     MR. DE ViJJERA sail that from the immediate pointcf view, the financial arrangements were the issues of                i            1                 II.....importance.   He agreed that there were political;onsiderations  in  the background.   As  in  19&amp;1,  he  hadWhetherthere was to be an association would depend on theconditions attached theretoOne of the matters which.would have to be considered was the division of Ireland.He felt sure that so long as the partition of theircountry lasted that the majority of Irishmen would takeadvantage of any opportunity to re-open that question.     MS. CHAMBERLAIN asked if he was ccrrect in under-standing Mr. De Valera to mean that his position at thenext election was not yet settled.   Mould a settlement ofthe financial question get rid of exij difficulty over that?     MR. BE VALERA replied that, in the words cf Farnell,to try &quot;to put bounds to the march of a nation&apos;&apos; was avain thing.  There would always be people who would attemptto secure the freedom cf the Irish people.  If they feltthat that freedom could be secured within the association ehhe would say was &quot;go and try&quot;.
     MR. THOMAS said that he thought it was agreed by bothsides that the documents to be published as a result of thenegotiations should be : -     She two Irish Free State Memoranda.     The two United Kingdom notes in reply to those Memoranda.     Any further considered statement which the Irish       Free State Government might wish to submit.     The documents would thus be five in number.     MR-. THOli AS added that ho would inform the Cabinet ofthe result of the negotiations;  he would be compelled to saythat they had unfortunately found themselves unable to makeany progress.     111. HE VALEEA said that he would lime to know with what intention the United Kingdom delegates had entered tnenegotiations.     HE. THOMAS replied that they had been empowered to enterinto negotiation with the Free State representatives, to listen to any arguments presented to thaw., and to see whetherthose argua-mits justified any mitigation of the existingf inanei al agre ernents.     He wished to add that, notwithstanding all that had takenplace, the United Kingdom Government were prepared to renew theoffer regarding arbitration which they had previously made.They would net seek to interpret the answer which had been  .given that afternoon as a refusal to accept arbitration.     mli. DE VALERA thought that what Mr.Thomas had saidregarding a possible mitigation of the existing agreementsshowed that they had not been travelling on the road to asettlement.    The United Kingdom Government&apos;o instructionsto its delegates apparently only meant that id shy new pointshad been brought to light in the last two days which had been
i70overlooked in 19S3 and 19 6, the British Government would beprepared to consider them.  That really amounted, only to a repetition of the United Kingdom thesis that those agreements were binding documents.  They wore back again at the wellknown point of difference.     7171. (THOMAS said that all the points which had been brought up by the Pree State Ministers during the last two days hadbeen examined.     i,p?L. licSliTPl suggested that the examination had beensuperficial.  Further, ail the arguments had come from theFree State side and nothing had been suggested from the Britishside which could possibly lead to any modification of theIrish attitude towards the agreements.     It was only fair to add that, even supposing that theUnited Kingdom Ministers had succeeded all along the line inconvincing the Free State&apos; Delegation of the justice of their case, little would have been achieved.  The plain fact was thatthe Free State could not afford to make the payments.     MR.11A.GUIPJJJ thought that Mr.Thomas 1 s reference at themeeting last week to the possibility cf a comprehensive financial settlement was rather inconsistent with what he now told themregarding the instructions he had received from the UnitedKingdom Cabinet.     MR. THOMAS replied that if convincing claims had beenbrought forward of sufficient amount to wipe out the whole of the disputed payments he would have felt bound to consider them.     As it had turned out, nothing could have been more un-convinoing than the claims which had been brought forward onbehalf of the Free State.
     IviE.DE VALERA said that, although he feared it would hea waste of tine, he would let IIr. Thomas have the consideredstatement of the Eree State case which had been referred to.This would constitute the fifth Paper of the documents to bepublished.     MR.THOMAS said that he proposed that the publication should be a Parliamentary White Paper.    Presumably bothMr.de Valera and he would have to make oral statements in their respective Parliaments during the next few days.The White Paper, however, ought to be an agreed document,and it would not be published here until Mr.de Valera had seen it and given his consent.   What was said in parliament and the Dail should not prejudice this.     lv5R.DE VALERA suggested publication of the White paper in about a week&apos;s time.     MR.THOMAS agreed.     He added  that it only remained for him to express,  onbehalf of his  colleagues, their sincere regret at the failure to reach  agreement,  together with their  appreciation of  the courteous manner in  which the Eree  State  case  had beer-presented.   The negotiations had done nothing to bring together  their respective points  of view, but  he  thought that they had  led to  a great  increase  in their personal  respect for  each  other.     MR.DE VALERA said that  the  Free State  Delegation too regretted very deeply the failure of the negotiations.    He had  the feeling that  some fate  continued  to prevent that improvement in  the  relations between  the  two peopleswhich  men of good will on both  sides wished to bring about.He had not abandoned  his view that  there was no  reason  why the  two nations should not  live  in harmony, or his  hope  that one  day  their  relations  would again become  closer.    He
feared, however, that the result of their failure that day would he, for a tine, at any rote, to drive themfurther apart.     He was most happy to reciprocate what Mr.Thomas had said regarding the manner in which the negotiations had&quot;been conducted.     The meeting concluded at 5*^5 P*ni. , after it had beenagreed to issue the following Press Communique:-     &quot;The negotiations with the Irish Free State delegation were resumed at 2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, at 11 o&apos;clockthis morning, and continued this afternoon.     Mr.de Valera was accompanied by the same members ofthe Irish Free State Delegation as yesterday.   TheGovernment of the United Kingdom was represented by  thesame Ministers as yesterday with the addition of theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Sir John Simon).     It was unfortunately found impossible to reach  anagreement and the negotiations came to an end&quot;.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.15th October, I952.- 5.1 -
