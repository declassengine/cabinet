I circulate  to my colleagues a note  which by my instructions Sir  Warren Fisher has  prepared on the subject of the Police pay cut.(intl&apos;d&apos;d).   N.C.re a sur y Chamberlain er s, S.W.I.  21st September, 1932.
POLICE PAY CUTPapers CP. 290 (32)  of 23rd August,  1932,Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Secretaryof State for Scotland, of 9th September, 1932,   and CP. 302 (32) of 15th September 1932.          This note is in two parts,A.  dealing with considerations of merits, of equity       and the national issues involvedB.  dealing with the question of pledges.                        A,lo     Considerations of merits, of equity and of thefar wider national issues involved seem to me to be quiteconclusive against making any concession to the Police.       (l) The Prime Minister&apos;s statement in the           House of Commons on 21st September 1951x was           understood by everyone in any branch of           public service as a charter embodying  the           principle of equal sacrifice.       (2) By all comparative standards the Police are a           Highly privileged bodys, and this is perfectly           well known in all sections of the community.&quot;&quot;The Government have, as announced by me on Wednesday last, been &apos;tining details of the proposed scheme of reductions.   There are un-ibtedly classes of persons who are unfairly affected, and the Government&apos;e, in view of all the circumstances, come to the conclusion that thesplest way of. removing just grievances is to limit reductions as regardsseders, police, and. the three Defence Services, to not more than 10 perit.   This decision will not apply to the higher ranks of sommissionedleers in the Defence  Services.   The balance of the Budget will bentained&quot;ote - the pay cuts on comparable  ranks in the Civil Service were worked indifferent way, but have been cumulatively aver the years considerablyivier.)The Commissioner of Police stated to the Cabinet Committee on 10th&apos; 1952 (E.P.E.  (32) 2nd Meeting)  that on the whole he thought that onIts a total cut of 10-1 in all was justifiable for the police.                                   1.
     (5) The Post Office workers - and. the rest of         the rank and file in the Civil Service - the         sailors, soldiers, airmen, and teachers,         would therefore argue unansv/erably that any         relaxation in favour of the police could not         he withheld from themselves,     (4) The people on the &quot;dole&quot; -- most of whom         would he only too glad to work if they only         had a chance - would certainly claim that their         difficult lot should also he alleviated.     (5) The public at large would interpret it as         an authoritative sign that  the lean period was         over; and in consequence  the  wage-earners         throughout the country would treat it as a         ground for demanding improvements in their own         condition, and as an encouragement either to         strike or, where (as in the case of Lancashire) .         a fight has already started, to persist in it.2.     There is another and very serious aspect of thismatter which cannot be ignored.       It may now be taken as certain that there will tea heavy Budget deficit this year, with the prospect of astill larger deficit - on the basis  of existing taxation -next year.   Further economies will, therefore, have to beeffected (quite apart from any question of securing areduction of taxation),       As regards Administrative Costs a Treasury Circular(copy attached) was issued on 15th July, 1932.   In thefield of larger economies there are  already at work inFjngland and Scotland Local Authorities Economy Committees,which were set up at the instance of the government rnment (they are quite distinct from the unofficial committees of M.P.&apos;s).                          2.
These bodies may well find it necessary to  include  intheir recommendations the reduction of the  remuneration of municipal employees such as tramwaymen and dustmen.Similarly Parliament may have to consider the necessityof decreasing expenditure on such items as widows and old age pensions - as is apparently being done inAustralia - and even on war pensions.       How would it be possible to reconcile the im-position of cuts of this character (or indeed the in-troduction of any economies) with simultaneous concessions to the police in -relief of their pay cut?3c     Thus the ramifications of a surrender to thepolice might well be disastrous to the country whoseeconomic equilibrium - alike in a national and in abudgetary sense - is  still very far from assured,4.     I attach a copy of a letter written to me as theresult of a conference between the Admiralty  and the WarOffice on 29th ultimo.       As will be seen this reiterates the convictionalready expressed by  the Chiefs of Staff and myself about our  respective Services  to  the Cabinet  Committee on 10thMay  last (S.PoE. (32) 2nd Meeting).5.     The facts speak for  themselves; and I would mostearnestly submit that, however disappointed the policemay  be at not receiving preferential  treatment, nothingsectional should be  allowed for one moment to count against the national  interest.   The  motto of ancientRome  was &quot;salus reipublicae  suprema lex&quot;, and duringthis long-drawn crisis  in  our  fortunes  should not  the welfare of our country be  equally  the  supreme test?.
6.     The Home Secretary and the Scottish  Scc??etarvin their approach to the matter feel absolved from thenecessity of having any regard to considerations of meritsequity, or national interests because they  appear toassume that the position is governed by an  absolute pledge to the police, and to the police alone.7,     The real facts are as follows.       A Cabinet conclusion of 1st September 1931. havingbeen misunderstood by the two Ministers responsible forthe police, statements were made by them to the. respectivePolice Councils on 4th September which, while susceptibleof more than one interpretation, are certainly not a pledgthat the police should get off with less than the 12-^b&quot;May Committee&quot; cut on pay.8.     The Treasury were not informed, of these statementsuntil  after the event, and bhen only when the office wasin the process of preparing the White Paper of 10thSeptember which had in consequence to be re-worded incorrespondingly vague phraseology.   This document - onwhich  the Home Secretary and Scottish Secretary  take theistand as &quot;the full official statement oz&apos; the Government&apos;economy proposals&quot; - is likewise in no sense a pledge thatthe police should get off with less than the 12%$ &quot;MayCommittee&quot; cut on pay.   It recognised the necessity for&quot;substantial  sacrifices on the part of serving members ofthe forces &quot;and the first instalment for 1931-32 was fixed in general accordance with the principles of the MayCommittee plan.   The document went  on to say that  &quot;furthesubstantial  sacrifices on the part  of the police&quot; would be involved in  the following year;   and the references in the document to  the question of other  &quot;measures&quot; afforded in themselves no guarantee that the  &quot;further&quot;  substantial
 sacrifices would be disproportionate to the first instalment of  &quot;substantial sacrifices&quot;. 9.     On 21st September, following on the naval mutiny at  Invergordon and ether serious  news about the fleet which arrived that day, the Prime Minister made the announcement in the Hcuse of Commons which is quoted at the foot of page 1 of this note.       The Home Secretary in his letter of 13th instant to  the Prime Minister apparently misunderstands this announcement.       As is self-evident and was the intention, what was being announced was a concession; the people who previously had been faced with a pay cut higher than V3fo were told that &quot;the Government have come to the conclusion ... to limit reductions ... to not more than 10 per cent.&quot;   But this &quot;conclusion&quot; - having as its object a concession - could not simultaneously involve an increase of the cut imposed by the White Paper in other quarters.       Now the White Paper stated (page 3) that ;,the Government have decided to follow throughout the recom- mendations of the Committee on National Expenditure&quot; - i.e. the &quot;May Committee&quot; - so far as the members of the Grown Services are concerned (with the exception of those with  2000 a year ana upwards).    These &quot;May Committee&quot; recommendations had the effect of a pay cut less than 10$ in  the case of a certain proportion (representing some 15,000 pei&apos;sons) of the total personnel of the Defence Services -which was subject to cut.   Consequently, a statement in the House of Commons that the Government had come to the conclusion to limit  reductions to &quot;10 per cent.&quot; (without the saving words &quot;not more than&quot;), would have resulted in an increase of pay cuts in those oases,  notmerely in the teeth of the vc-oommendations oi  the &quot;May
natter of fact the  police were  already  being treated better  than3ne  else by reason  of  their pay cuts being made  in  two  instalments. Committee&quot;, &quot;but in violation of its own White Paper. Accordingly the Prime Minister had to use the phrase &quot;to limit  reductions ... to not more than 10 per cent.&quot;       The Home Secretary erroneously argues that this phrase contemplated differential treatment - in favour of  the police - as between the categories particularised in the Prime Minister&apos;s announcement, viz: teachers, police, and the three Defence Services whose original pay cut was more than 1Q&amp;.       The foregoing explanation of the facts shews this argument to he unfounded; and therefore it is un- necessary to emphasise the significance of the PrimeMinister&apos;s observations - &quot;there are undoubtedly classes of persons who are unfairly affected&quot; and &quot;the simclest way                                  of of removing just grievances&quot; - for/all persons in public employment the policex are admittedly the most privileged,. 10.    Tne Prime Minister&apos;s statement was - and hasbeen understood by all branches of the Public Service tobe - an unqualified pledge embodying the principle of equal  sacrifice.11.    The subsequent statement in the House of commons by the Home Secretary on 25th September was of course made in the light of the Prime Minister&apos;s announcement and could in no sense overrule it.   He said that &quot;the Home Office and the Police Council agreed that, instead of the whole of these economies falling upon the pay of the various ranks of the force, as much aspossible should be effected by administrative economies&quot;.This is necessarily subject to the pledge applicable to the whole Public Service that there should be equality of sacrifice.
          12.    As  a matter of fact, whatever interpretation the          Home  Secretary and the Scottish Secretary may wish to place          on  the circumstances - and  as  to  the correct interpreta-          tion  there is no  doubt -  their difficulty is disposed          of  by their own figures.    The;/ take their stand on the          White Paper of 10th September 1.931  &quot;the full official          statement  of the  Government&apos;s  economy proposals&quot;; and this          quite explicitly  requires a saving  per annum of  2,000,000          from  Police expenditure from 1st  October 1932 - a          requirement which still stands.                 The appendix to their joint  memorandum of 9th          instant  shews a saving for  the year commencing October          1932  of   1,266,134 i.e.,  a  shortage on the requisite           2,000,000 of just on  734,000.                 The second b% pay  cut (making lOVb in all) will          not quite  produce this amount.          15.    It  should  be observed,  finally, that on the 10th          May last the Home Secretary accepted the imposition of a          second cut of 5.   over and above the first 5/S.   In the          course of  his concluding  remarks  he informed the Cabinet          Committee  that he proposed  to  submit to  them a scheme          which, inter alia, included the imposition in October          next of  &quot;the five per cent  second instalment of /the cut          in  police  pay&quot; -  E.P.E.  (32) 2nd  Meeting, page 14.&quot;&apos;                 In  fact he took no  further  action until (some          3^  months  later)  he circulated  on  23rd August the          paper referred to at  the  commencement of this note,          CP.  290 (32).

T.C  No.  12/32.  Further  copies of this circular  may be. obtained  upon  application on the usual  Form of      Demand at His Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office, Shepherdess Walk, City Road, N.l.Lone No.: Whitehall 12&amp;1.\c\thj to this letter should be addressed to-It)The Secretary,               Treasury,   Whitehall, London, S.W.1,  and the following number quoted              E. 27871.TREASURY  CHAMBERS,                15th July,  1932.SlK,                            ADMINISTRATIVE  COSTS.    1. I am directed by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury  to invite yourattention to the special need in the present financial circumstances for an intensified effort to secure a further reduction in the cost of administration of the  public services.    2.  A further review of the work of each Department and Branch should  be  undertaken with a view to the slowing down, suspension,  or abolition of work or services which, howeverdesirable,  cannot be regarded as absolutely essential in present circumstances.  In this  con-nection, no Department  should regard  itself  as  debarred  from proposing  a measure of economy by reason of the  fact that legislative sanction would be required to give effect to it.    3.  Concurrently with  this review,  a special investigation  of existing methods of work should also be undertaken.  My Lords are aware  that in recent years increasing attention has been paid to this matter  and They appreciate the results  already achieved  in this sphere.Having regard, however, to the urgent need for a marked reduction in expenditure, a specialendeavour  should  now  be made to accelerate economies.  The general aim  should be thesimplification of methods  of transacting business  wherever  possible and the  elimination ofevery process which is  not absolutely  vital.   It should be  borne in mind that even smallsavings when  effected over a  wide field may amount to a considerable sum in  the aggregate.No saving, however small, should therefore  be ignored.    4.  The best resultr will only be achieved if the lines of enquiry are determined by refer-ence to the type of work performed  in  the  particular Branch or  Department.   My Lordssuggest, however, that some, at least,  of  the following enquiries (which are illustrative only)might also  usefully  be made the subject of investigation in all cases :          (a) Consideration should be given to the  extension to the utmost  degree possible of     the use  of machines, particularly on accounting, calculating and reproduction work.     With this object in  view  existing processes should be  examined  and adapted to  suit     machine methods wherever it is economically advantageous to do so.         (6) Checking work  should be  reviewed  to ensure that the  cost of each check is not     disproportionate to  the object achieved.  Test samples  or percentage checks are found     to serve sufficiently well in many cases, and where such  systems are already in  operation     the extent of the  check might also be reviewed,  consistently with the maintenance of     reasonable safeguards.         (c) Office  forms  should be examined with a view  to securing that  the lay-out is     such  as to facilitate to  the full  extent their completion and subsequent handling.  The     possibility of reducing  the number  of forms,  by amalgamation or otherwise,  should be     carefully considered.
          (d) Records and statistics should be carefully examined, the practical use made of      them analysed,  and any of insufficient value dispensed with.  Any duplication of records      should be eliminated.          (e) Orders  for duplicating and printing should be examined with a view to their      reduction.  In  some cases it may be found that the employment of staff on compiling      the  material can  be  avoided or  postponed, and  in others that reproduction  is  not      essential  or that the number of copies ordered can  be  restricted.  Under this head,  a      review should be undertaken of all reports, returns, &amp;c, presented  by the Department      to Parliament  or  printed as non-Parliamentary publications with  a view to  discon-      tinuance wherever possible.          (/) Expenditure on stationery,  telegrams and telephones, and accommodation and      office equipment should also be carefully reviewed with  a view to reduction.          (ff) Registration of documents and files should be simplified where possible, and      unnecessary registration should be dispensed with.          (A) Enquiry should be  made into the possibility  of  preparing  simultaneously      different documents bearing common information.          (i) A close  watch should be kept on the output of work in order to secure reductions      of staff at  the earliest possible moment.          (j) Expenditure on travelling  should  be made the subject of a special review with      the  object  of confining travelling within the  narrowest practicable limits.  In this      connection  the  possibility of reducing the  amount of inspection at present undertaken,      and of combining inspectorates, should be carefully  explored.    5.  Their Lordships&apos; officers will be ready to  co-operate at any time in any of the investiga-tions to be instituted  in consequence of this Circular, and They understand that the controller of H.M. Stationery Office and the First  Commissioner of  Works  will similarly be preparedto give advice and assistance in matters coming within the scope of those Departments.    6.  The result of the investigation described above  will afford a fresh occasion to  review the numbers in relation to the essential duties of the Department or Branch and the necessityfor filling vacancies  which may occur  should accordingly  be  the  subject of special scrutiny.Vacancies  should be  filled only when the clearest need  arises.    7.  My Lords would be glad to receive a report not later than the 1st November next,indicating the steps  taken in response to this Circular, the results achieved up to that date and the savings which are expected to accrue as  the result of the measures taken.  This report should specify the extent to  which the  reductions of staff already  effected, or in prospect,can  be  met by the non-filling of  vacancies  arising  in  the Department concerned, and  thenumber of officers by grades who could be spared for transfer to necessary vacancies in otherDepartments.                                                 1  am,                                                      Your  obedient servant,                                                              N.

                                             ADMIRALTY.  S.W.                                                29th August, 1932.         My dear Fisher,                In view of the first part of conclusion No.  7 of         the Cabinet meeting on Saturday last, 27th August,  on the         subject of the second instalment of the cut in Police pay         agreeing that the Home Secretary and the Secretary of         State for Scotland in the light of the discussion at the         Cabinet should now prepare a definite scheme for the solution         of the difficulty and should discuss it with the Treasury,         the Admiralty and War Office have had a conference this         afternoon, to consider the possible effects^on the pay         of the Navy and Army.                We think that the Treasury should know at once         that both Departments remain emphatically of the opinion         that any scheme by which the second instalment of the cut         in police pay is reduced either directly of indirectly         will necessitate the re-opening of the question of         service pay with a view to the grant of an equivalent         concession, otherwise it will be considered both in the         Navy and the Army that there has been a complete departure          from the Prime Minister&apos;s declaration of the 21st         September last.                             Yours sincerely,                                (Signed)  O.A.K.  MURRAY.                                          J.B.
